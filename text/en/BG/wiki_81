<text>An instrument amplifier is an electronic amplifier that converts the often barely audible or purely electronic signal of a musical instrument into a larger electronic signal to feed to a loudspeaker. An instrument amplifier is used with musical instruments such as an electric guitar, an electric bass, electric organ, electric piano, synthesizers and drum machine to convert the signal from the pickup (with guitars and other string instruments and some keyboards) or other sound source (e.g, a synthesizer&#x27;s signal) into an electronic signal that has enough power, produced by a power amplifier, to drive one or more loudspeaker that can be heard by the performers and audience. 

Combination (combo) amplifiers include a preamplifier, a power amplifier, tone controls, and one or more speakers in a cabinet, a housing or box usually made of wood. Instrument amplifiers for some instruments are also available without an internal speaker; these amplifiers, called &quot;heads&quot;, must plug into one or more separate speaker cabinets. Instrument amplifiers also have features that let the performer modify the signal&#x27;s tone, such as changing the equalization (adjusting bass and treble tone) or adding electronic effects such as intentional distortion or overdrive, reverb or chorus effect.

Instrument amplifiers are available for specific instruments, including the electric guitar, electric bass, electric and electronic keyboards, and acoustic instruments such as the mandolin and banjo. Some amplifiers are designed for specific styles of music, such as the Fender tweed guitar amplifiers, such as the Fender Bassman used by blues and country music musicians, and the Marshall amplifiers used by hard rock and heavy metal bands.

Unlike home hi-fi amplifiers or public Address systems, which are designed to accurately reproduce the source sound signals with as little distortion as possible, instrument amplifiers are often designed to add additional tonal coloration to the original signal, and in many cases intentionally add some degree of distortion.

==Types==

===Guitar amplifiers===

A guitar amplifier amplifies the electrical signal of an electric guitar so that it can drive a loudspeaker at sufficient volume for the performer and audience to hear. Most guitar amplifiers can also modify the instrument&#x27;s sound with controls that emphasize or de-emphasize certain frequencies and add electronic effects. String vibrations are sensed by a pickup. For electric guitars, strings are made of metal, and the pickup works by electromagnetic induction. 

====Standard amps====
Standard amplifiers, such as the Fender &quot;tweed&quot;-style amps (e.g., the Fender Bassman) and Gibson amps, are often used by traditional rock, blues, and country musicians who wish to create a vintage 1950s-style sound. They are used by electric guitarists, pedal steel guitar players, and blues harmonica (&quot;harp&quot;) players. Combo amplifiers such as the Fender Super Reverb have powerful, loud tube amplifiers, four 10&quot; speakers, and they often have built-in reverb and vibrato effects units. Smaller guitar amps are also available, which have fewer speakers (some have only one speaker) and lighter, less powerful amplifier units. Smaller guitar amps are easier to transport to gigs and sound recording sessions. Smaller amps are widely used in small venue shows (nightclubs) and in recordings, because players can obtain the tone they want without having to have an excessively loud volume. One of the challenge with the large, powerful 4x10 Fender Bassman-type amps is that to get the tone a player wants, they have to turn up the amp to a loud volume.

These amps are designed to produce a variety of sounds ranging from a clean, warm sound (when used in country and soft rock) to a growling, natural overdrive, when the volume is set near its maximum, (when used for blues, rockabilly, psychobilly, and roots rock). These amplifiers usually have a sharp treble roll-off at 5 kHz to reduce the extreme high frequencies, and a bass roll-off at 60–100 Hz to reduce unwanted boominess. The nickname &quot;tweed&quot; refers to the lacquered beige-light brown fabric covering used on these amplifiers. 

The smallest combo amplifiers, which are mainly used for individual practice and warm-up purposes, may have only a single 8&quot; or 10&quot; speaker. Some harmonica players use these small combo amplifiers for concert performances, though, because it is easier to create natural overdrive with these lower-powered amplifiers. Larger combo amplifiers, with one 12 inch speaker or two or four 10 or 12 inch speakers are used for club performances and larger venues. For large concert venues such as stadiums, performers may also use an amplifier &quot;head&quot; with several separate speaker cabinets (which usually contain two or four 12&quot; speakers).

====Hard rock and heavy metal====

Electric guitar amplifiers designed for heavy metal are used to add an aggressive &quot;drive&quot;, intensity, and &quot;edge&quot; to the guitar sound with distortion effects, preamplification boost controls (sometimes with multiple stages of preamps), and tone filters. While many of the most expensive, high-end models use 1950s-style tube amplifiers (even in the 2000s), there are also many models that use transistor amplifiers, or a mixture of the two technologies (i.e., a tube preamplifier with a transistor power amplifier). Amplifiers of this type, such as Marshall amplifiers, are used in a range of the louder, heavier genres of rock, including hard rock, heavy metal, and hardcore punk. This type of amplifier is available in a range of formats, ranging from small, self-contained combo amplifiers for rehearsal and warm-ups to heavy &quot;heads&quot; that are used with separate speaker cabinets—colloquially referred to as a &quot;stack&quot;.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, public address systems at rock concerts were used mainly for the vocals. As a result, to get a loud electric guitar sound, early heavy metal and rock-blues bands often used stacks of 4x12&quot; Marshall speaker cabinets on the stage. In 1969, Jimi Hendrix used four stacks to create a powerful lead sound, and in the early 1970s by the band Blue Öyster Cult used an entire wall of Marshall Amplifiers to create a roaring wall of sound that projected massive volume and sonic power. In the 1980s, metal bands such as Slayer and Yngwie Malmsteen also used &quot;walls&quot; of over 20 Marshall cabinets. However, by the 1980s and 1990s, most of the sound at live concerts was produced by the sound reinforcement system rather than the onstage guitar amplifiers, so most of these cabinets were not connected to an amplifier. Instead, walls of speaker cabinets were used for aesthetic reasons. 

Amplifiers for harder, heavier genres often use valve amplifiers (known as tube amplifiers in North America) also. Valve amplifiers are perceived by musicians and fans to have a warmer tone than those of transistor amps, particularly when overdriven (turned up to the level that the amplifier starts to clip or shear off the waveforms). Instead of abruptly clipping off the signal at cut-off and saturation levels, the signal is rounded off more smoothly. Vacuum tubes also exhibit different harmonic effects than transistors. In contrast to the tweed-style amplifiers, which use speakers in an open-backed cabinet, companies such as Marshall tend to use 12&quot; speakers in a closed-back cabinet. These amplifiers usually allow users to switch between clean and distorted tones (or a rhythm guitar-style &quot;crunch&quot; tone and a sustained &quot;lead&quot; tone) with a foot-operated switch.

===Bass===

Bass amplifiers are designed for bass guitars or more rarely, for upright bass. They differ from amplifiers for the electric guitar in several respects, with extended low-frequency response, and tone controls optimized for the needs of bass players.

Higher-cost bass amplifiers may include built-in bass effects units, such as audio compressor or limiter features, to avoid unwanted distorting at high volume levels and potential damage to speakers; equalizers; and bass overdrive. 

Bass amps may provide an XLR DI output for plugging the bass amp signal directly into a mixing board or PA system. Larger, more powerful bass amplifiers (300 or more watts) are often provided with internal or external metal heat sinks and/or fans to help keep the components cool. 

Speaker cabinets designed for bass usually use larger loudspeakers (or more loudspeakers, such as four ten-inch speakers) than the cabinets used for other instruments, so that they can move the larger amounts of air needed to reproduce low frequencies. Bass players have to use more powerful amplifiers than the electric guitarists, because deep bass frequencies take more power to amplify. While the largest speakers commonly used for regular electric guitar have twelve-inch cones, electric bass speaker cabinets often use 15&quot; speakers. Bass players who play styles of music that require an extended low-range response, such as death metal, sometimes use speaker cabinets with 18&quot; speakers or add a large subwoofer cabinet to their rig.

Speakers for bass instrument amplification tend to be heavier-duty than those for regular electric guitar, and the speaker cabinets are typically more rigidly constructed and heavily braced, to prevent unwanted buzzes and rattles. Bass cabinets often include bass reflex ports, vents or openings in the cabinet, which improve the bass response and low-end, especially at high volumes.

===Keyboard===
A keyboard amplifier, used for the stage piano, synthesizer, clonewheel organs and similar instruments, is distinct from other types of amplification systems due to the particular challenges associated with keyboards; namely, to provide solid low-frequency sound reproduction &quot;and&quot; crisp high-frequency sound reproduction. It is typically a combination amplifier that contains a two, three, or four-channel mixer, a pre-amplifier for each channel, equalization controls, a power amplifier, a speaker, and a horn, all in a single cabinet.

Notable exceptions include keyboard amplifiers for specific keyboard types. The vintage Leslie speaker cabinet and modern recreations, which are generally used for Hammond organs, use a tube amplifier that is often turned up to add a warm, &quot;growling&quot; overdrive. Some electric pianos have built-in amplifiers and speakers, in addition to outputs for external amplification.

===Acoustic amplifiers ===
These amplifiers are intended for acoustic instruments such as violin (&quot;fiddle&quot;), mandolin, harp, and acoustic guitar—especially for the way musicians play these instruments in quieter genres such as folk and bluegrass. They are similar to keyboard amplifiers, in that they have a relatively flat frequency response and avoid tonal coloration. 

To produce this relatively clean sound, these amplifiers often have very powerful amplifiers (up to 800 watts RMS), to provide additional headroom and prevent unwanted distortion. Since an 800-watt amplifier built with standard Class AB technology would be heavy, some acoustic amplifier manufacturers use lightweight Class D, &quot;switching amplifiers&quot;.

Acoustic amplifier designs strive to produce a clean, transparent, &quot;acoustic&quot; sound that does not—except for reverb and other effects—alter the natural instrument sound, other than to make it louder. Amplifiers often come with a simple mixer to blend signals from a pickup and microphone. Since the early 2000s, it is increasingly common for acoustic amplifiers to provided digital effects, such as reverb and compression. Some also contain feedback-suppressing devices, such as notch filters or parametric equalizers.

Acoustic guitars do not usually have a built-in pickup or microphone, at least with entry-level and beginner instruments. Some acoustic guitars have a small condenser microphone mounted inside the body, which designed to convert acoustic vibrations into an electrical signal, but usually they do so from direct contact with the strings (replacing the guitar&#x27;s bridge) or with the guitar&#x27;s body, rather than having a membrane-like general-purpose microphone. Acoustic guitars may also use a piezoelectric pickup, which converts the vibrations of the instrument into an electronic signal. More rarely, a magnetic pickup may be mounted in the sound hole of an acoustic guitar; while magnetic pickups do not have the same acoustic tone that microphones and piezo pickups can produce, magnetic pickups are more resistant to acoustic feedback.

==Roles==
Instrument amplifiers have a different purpose than &#x27;Hi-Fi&#x27; (high fidelity) stereo amplifiers in radios and home stereo systems. Hi-fi home stereo amplifiers strive to accurately reproduce signals from pre-recorded music, with as little harmonic distortion as possible. In contrast, instrument amplifiers are add additional tonal coloration to the original signal or emphasize certain frequencies. For electric instruments such as electric guitar, the amplifier helps to create the instrument&#x27;s tone by boosting the input signal gain and distorting the signal, and by emphasizing frequencies deemed desirable (e.g., low frequencies) and de-emphasizing frequencies deemed undesirable (e.g., very high frequencies).

===Size and power rating===
In the 1960s and 1970s, large, heavy, high-output power amplifiers were preferred for instrument amplifiers, especially for large concerts, because public address systems were generally only used to amplify the vocals. Moreover, in the 1960s, PA systems typically did not use monitor speaker systems to amplify the music for the onstage musicians. Instead, the musicians were expected to have instrument amplifiers that were powerful enough to provide amplification for the stage and audience. In late 1960s and early 1970s rock concerts, bands often used large stacks of speaker cabinets powered by heavy tube amplifiers such as the Super Valve Technology (SVT) amplifier, which was often used with eight 10&quot; speakers.

However, over subsequent decades, PA systems substantially improved, and used different approaches, such as horn-loaded &quot;bass bins&quot; (in the 1980s) and subwoofers (1990s and 2000s) to amplify bass frequencies. As well, in the 1980s and 1990s, monitor systems substantially improved, which helped sound engineers provide onstage musicians with a better reproduction of their instruments&#x27; sound. 

As a result of improvements to PA and monitor systems, musicians in the 2000s no longer need huge, powerful amplifier systems. A small combo amplifier patched into the PA suffices. In the 2000s, virtually all sound reaching the audience in large venues comes from the PA system. Onstage instrument amplifiers are more likely to be at a low volume, because high volume levels onstage make it harder for the sound engineer to control the sound mix. 

As a result, in many large venues much of the onstage sound reaching the musicians now comes from in-ear monitors, not from the instrument amplifiers. While stacks of huge speaker cabinets and amplifiers are still used in concerts (especially in heavy metal), this is often mainly for aesthetics or to create a more authentic tone. The switch to smaller instrument amplifiers makes it easier for musicians to transport their equipment to performances. As well, it makes concert stage management easier at large clubs and festivals where several bands are performing in sequence, because the bands can be moved on and off the stage more quickly.

==Amplifier technology ==
Instrument amplifiers may be based on thermionic (tube or valve) or solid state (transistor) technology.

===Tube amplifiers===

Vacuum tubes were the dominant active electronic components in amplifiers from the 1930s through the early 1970s, and tube amplifiers remain preferred by many musicians and producers. Some musicians feel that tube amplifiers produce a warmer or more natural sound than solid state units, and a more pleasing overdrive sound when overdriven. However, these subjective assessments of the attributes of tube amplifiers&#x27; sound qualities are the subject of ongoing debate. Tube amps are more fragile, require more maintenance, and are usually more expensive than solid-state amps.

Tube amplifiers produce more heat than solid-state amplifiers, but few manufacturers of these units include cooling fans in the chassis. While tube amplifiers do need to attain a proper operating temperature, if the temperature goes above this operating temperature, it may shorten the tubes&#x27; lifespan and lead to tonal inconsistencies.
===Solid-state amplifiers===

By the 1960s and 1970s, semiconductor transistor-based amplifiers began to become more popular because they are less expensive, more resistant to bumps during transportation, lighter-weight, and require less maintenance. In some cases, tube and solid-state technologies are used together in amplifiers. A common setup is the use of a tube preamplifier with a solid-state power amplifier. There are also an increasing range of products that use digital signal processing and digital modeling technology to simulate many different combinations of amp and cabinets. 

The output transistors of solid-state amplifiers can be passively cooled by using metal fins called heatsinks to radiate away the heat. For high-wattage amplifiers (over 800 watts), a fan is often used to move air across internal heatsinks.
===Hybrid===
The most common hybrid amp design is to use a tube preamp with a solid-state power amplifier. This gives users the pleasing preamp and overdrive tone of a tube amp with the lowered cost, maintenance and weight of a solid-state power amp.

<doc id="319563" wikidata="Q41107" url="?curid=319563" title=".eu">
<text>.eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for any person, company or organization based in the European Union. This was extended to the European Economic Area in 2014, after the regulation was incorporated into the EEA Agreement, and hence is also available for any person, company or organization based in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic. Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a sunrise period, in an effort to prevent cybersquatting. Full registration started on 7 April 2006.

==History==
===Establishment===
The .eu ccTLD was approved by ICANN on 22 March 2005 and put in the Internet root zone on 2 May 2005. Even though the EU is not a country (it is a sui generis intergovernmental and supranational organisation), it has an exceptional reservation in ISO 3166. The Commission and ICANN had extended negotiations lasting more than five years to secure its acceptance.

&quot;.eu.int&quot; was the subdomain most used by the European Commission and the European Parliament, based on the .int generic top-level domain (gTLD) for international bodies, until 9 May 2006. The .eu domain (ccTLD) was launched in December 2005, and because of this most .eu.int domain names changed to .europa.eu on Europe day, 9 May 2006.

===Sunrise period===
The sunrise period was broken into two phases. The first phase, which began on 7 December 2005 was to facilitate applications by registrants with prior rights based on trademarks and geographic names. The second phase began on 7 February 2006 and covered company, trade and personal names. In the case of all Sunrise applications, the application needed to be accompanied by documents proving the claim to ownership of a certain right. The decision was then made by PricewaterhouseCoopers Belgium, which had been chosen as the validation agent by EURid.

On 7 February 2006, the registry was opened for company, trade and personal names. In the first 15 minutes, there were 27,949 total applications, and after one hour, 71,235.

===Landrush===
On 7 April 2006 at 11 am CET registration became possible for non-trademark holders. Most people requesting domains had asked their registrars to put their requested domains in a queue, ensuring the best chance to register a domain. This way more than 700,000 domains were registered during the first 4 hours of operation. Some large registrars like GoDaddy and small registrars like Dotster suffered from long queues and unresponsiveness, allowing people to &#x27;beat the queue&#x27; by registering through a registrar that had already processed its queue. By August 2006, 2 Million .eu domains had been registered. It was then fourth-largest ccTLD in Europe, after .de, .uk and .nl, and is one of the largest internationally.

The number of .eu domain registrations during the year after the landrush 7 April 2006 to 6 April 2007 seems to have peaked at approximately 2.6 million .eu domains. The market adjustment that follows a landrush in any domain name extension ensures that the number of registered domains will fall as many speculative domain registrations that failed to be resold will not be renewed. This is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Junk Dump&quot;. On the morning of 7 April 2007, the number of active .eu domains stood at 2,590,160 with approximately 15,000 domains having been deleted since 5 April 2007.

===Stabilisation===

Approximately 1.5 million .eu domains were up for renewal in April 2007. The EURid registry software is based on the DNS.be software and domains are physically renewed at the end of the month of their anniversary of registration. This process differs from more sophisticated registries like that of .com TLD and other ccTLDs that operate on a daily basis. As with any post-landrush phase, an extension shrinks as the &quot;Junk Dump&quot; takes effect.

Over one year after the launch of .eu (5 July 2007), the number of .de domains registered was 11,079,557 according to the German .de registry&#x27;s statistics page, while number of German owned .eu domains according to EURid&#x27;s statistics page was 796,561. The number of .uk domains registered was 6,038,732 according to .uk registry Nominet&#x27;s statistics page. The number of apparently UK owned .eu domains was 344,584.

The extent of the shrinkage of .eu ccTLD is difficult to estimate because EURid does not publish detailed statistics on the number of new domains registered each day. Instead it provides only a single figure for the number of active domains. The number of new registrations are combined with numbers of domains registered. Approximately 250,000 .eu domains were either deleted or moved into quarantine by 30 April 2007. In the intervening years the renewal rate has stabilised to approximately 80%, which is above the industry average.

===Brexit===
On 29 March 2018, as a consequence of the United Kingdom&#x27;s exit from the European Union, it was announced that &quot;as of the withdrawal date, undertakings and organisations that are established in the United Kingdom but not in the EU, and natural persons who reside in the United Kingdom will no longer be eligible to register .eu domain names or, if they are .eu registrants, to renew .eu domain names registered before the withdrawal date&quot;. The commission announced on 27 April 2018 that it would like to open registration to all EU and EEA citizens, including those living outside the EU. The Parliament, the council, and the Commission reached an agreement on this in December 2018, and the corresponding regulation passed the Parliament on 31 January 2019.

The 317,000 British .eu domain names were subject to Brexit negotiations because the .eu domain is reserved for European Union use. The .eu Brexit would have occurred on 30 March 2020, in case of no deal, but had since been postponed to January 2021. The UK-EU free trade deal does not cover .eu domains.

The United Kingdom Government released guidance for British citizens regarding .eu domains in October 2020, and .eu holders with a British address attached have been contacted twice by the domain registry regarding their domains – once in October 2020, once in December 2020.

British citizens had their .eu domains suspended on 1 January 2021 for three months, and then deleted on 1 March 2021 after a grace period to allow EU/EEA citizens to update the registration information to show their non-UK address. This is the first case of its kind where an institution managing an internet top-level domain has withdrawn domains &quot;en masse&quot; for an entire country.

==Use by the European Union institutions==

The second-level domain .europa.eu has been reserved for EU institution sites, with institutions and agencies making the switch from .eu.int to .europa.eu domains on the Europe day of 9 May 2006.

==Actual use==

The main users of .eu domains are websites with pan-European or cross-border intentions and audiences. It is often used to emphasise the &#x27;European identity&#x27; of a website, as opposed to the website having a strictly national ccTLD or global &quot;dotcom&quot; nature. Alternative (opportunistic) uses include Basque webpages (as the initial letters of Euskadi or the language Euskara) and Romanian, Portuguese, or Galician personal sites, as is the equivalent of the English pronoun &#x27;I&#x27; in those languages.

In most countries of the EU, the national ccTLDs have the major share of the market with the remainder spread over .com/.net/.org/.info/.biz. As a result of this, .eu has had an uphill battle to gain a significant share of these national markets. The dominant players tend to be the national ccTLD and .com. The other TLDs such as .net, .org and to a lesser extent .info and .biz have progressively smaller shares of these national markets.

Some .eu domain names have had some popularity, such as torrentz2.eu. As of November 2019, according to the Tranco rank, the top 100 thousand most popular domains in the world included over 200 .eu domains.

===Parking and redirects===
As of around 2010, some statistics indicated a large number of .eu domains being used to direct to other domains.
* Some domain registrants use their .eu website as a web portal containing a list of their national websites with national ccTLDs.
* Other registrants have registered a .eu domain name to protect the brand name of their main website or domain, and redirect visitors to their pre-existing national ccTLD or .com website. &quot;(example: www.champagne.eu)&quot;
* 12.8% of .eu websites are parking pages with pay per click (PPC) advertisements. ISPs and web hosters will often point unused domains to a domain parking webpage with PPC advertising. This percentage does not include .eu domains that are pointed to holding pages or not set up in DNS.
* 26% of .eu domain names are redirects for existing national ccTLD or .com websites.

According to page 20 of EURid&#x27;s Annual Report for 2006, the breakdown of .eu domain ownership figures on 31 December 2006 was:

* Registrants with more than 10,000 domains: 6
* Registrants with 5,000–9,999 domains: 18
* Registrants with 1,000–4,999 domains: 64
* Registrants with 100-999 domains: 1,257
* Registrants with 10–99 domains: 20,886
* Registrants with 6–9 domains: 22,933
* Registrants with 5 domains: 13,200 – (66,000 domains)
* Registrants with 4 domains: 23,007 – (92,028 domains)
* Registrants with 3 domains: 42,887 – (128,661 domains)
* Registrants with 2 domains: 115,543 – (231,086 domains)
* Registrants with 1 domain: 610,679

The number of registrants with five domains or fewer registered in .eu ccTLD was, according to these statistics, 805,316. These registrants accounted for 1,128,454 domains out of 2,444,947 .eu domains registered as of 31 December 2006. These registrations, typically those of individuals and companies protecting their brand, only represent 46% of the number of registered .eu domains.

==Cyrillic domain==

, a top-level domain using Cyrillic letters was put into operation on 1 June 2016. A Cyrillic domain was needed because Bulgaria, a member of the EU, uses the Cyrillic alphabet. Keyboards and smartphones used in Bulgaria have special key combinations to change script, but in order to avoid that, all-Cyrillic addresses are used. The EU is called () in Bulgarian Cyrillic, but (in Cyrillic letters) is much too similar to .ec (in Latin letters), the existing top-level domain of Ecuador, so was chosen. (While some Latin and Cyrillic letters may look identical, they have different character encodings and are distinct for data processing purposes. Consequently, there is an opportunity for misrepresentation unless steps are taken to prevent abusive registration).

EURid has a rule that the second-level domain name must be in the same script as the top-level domain, so Cyrillic second-level domains must go under instead of .eu, and all domain names under .ею must be spelt using Cyrillic. Older Cyrillic domains under .eu were cloned into at its launch.

As of March 2024, there are 1,486 registered domains under .

==Greek domain==

An application for a top-level domain using Greek letters, was submitted in 2016.

The application was originally turned down because it was too visually similar to .eu.
The Greek name of the EU is (), but would be too visually similar to .ee, the top-level domain of Estonia.

In 2019 steps were taken towards approving as a domain. The proposal was to have one and the same registry manager of .eu, .ею and , which shall make sure second-level domains are not visually similar and in the long-term assign all Cyrillic domains under .eu to and all Greek letters domains to . domain names were officially launched in November 2019.

As of March 2024, there are 2,595 registered domains under .

== Allegations of abuse ==

Domain name speculation, domain name warehousing and cybersquatting are always features of the launch of any new TLD; however, this was more widespread in the case of the .eu launch.

Bob Parsons, CEO and co-founder of GoDaddy, criticized the landrush process designed by EURid. Particularly, he condemned the use of shell companies by some registrars. In his blog, he stated &quot;These companies, instead of only registering their real active registrars, created hundreds of new &quot;phantom&quot; registrars.&quot; Parsons cited a group of about 400 companies, all with similar address and contact information based in New York, each registered as an LLC; in his opinion, these were phantom registrars &quot;created to hijack the .EU landrush.&quot;

These &quot;phantom&quot; registrars effectively had hundreds of opportunities of registering a domain whereas a genuine registrar effectively only had one opportunity to register the same domain. Thus some registrants were crowded out of the .eu landrush process and many generic .eu domain names are now owned by the companies using these &quot;phantom&quot; registrars.

Patrik Lindén, spokesman for EURid at the time, denied the allegations by Parsons, stating that &quot;[EURid] verified that each registrar was an individual legal entity. Each had to sign an agreement with us, and prepay €10,000.&quot; Parsons did not dispute that each registrar was a separate legal entity, but noted that creating such entities was trivial: &quot;Mr. Linden seemed proud that the EURid registry verified that each applicant was a legal entity before it was accredited. Take a moment and think about what that means. You can form a &quot;legal entity&quot; for $50 – an LLC – and you are good to go. Is that what we want a registry to do? Don&#x27;t we want them instead to make sure that the organization it allows to provide end-users with its domain names – especially Europe&#x27;s very own domain name – are actually in the domain name registration business?&quot;

Others claimed that .eu domain had been actively targeted during the sunrise period by speculators using fast-track Benelux trademarks to create &quot;prior rights&quot; on various high-value generic terms and during the landrush by speculators using EU front companies in the UK and Cyprus to register large numbers of domains. While speculative activity occurred with the launch of other domains, it was the scale of the activity that called into question the competence of EURid in protecting the integrity of eu ccTLD.

The EURid organisation investigated some allegations of abuse, and in July 2006 announced the suspension of over 74,000 domain names and that they were suing 400 registrars for breach of contract. The status of the domains was changed from &quot;active&quot; to &quot;on-hold&quot;. This meant that the domains could not be moved or have their ownership changed. The registrars also lost their access to the EURid registration database meaning that they could no longer register .eu domain names. The legal action relates to the practice of domain name warehousing, whereby large numbers of domain names are registered, often by registrars, with the intention of subsequently selling them on to third parties. EURid rules state that applications for domains can only be made after a legitimate application has been made to a registrar. The 74,000 applications were made in the name of only three Cyprus registered companies – Ovidio Ltd., Fausto Ltd. and Gabino Ltd.

The affected registrars, joined in the action by the affected registrants, obtained a provisional order from the Court of First Instance in Brussels, Belgium on 27 September 2006. The court ordered EURid to release the blocked domain names or else pay a fine of €25,000 per hour for each affected domain name. EURid complied with the court order and changed the status of the domains from &quot;on-hold&quot; to &quot;active&quot; and restored EURid registration database access to the affected registrars.

The main legal action, that of EURid seeking the registrar agreements between EURid and the registrars in question to be dissolved has still to be heard.

<doc id="319565" wikidata="Q284623" url="?curid=319565" title="Impenitent thief">
<text>The impenitent thief is a man described in the New Testament account of the Crucifixion of Jesus. In the Gospel narrative, two bandits are crucified alongside Jesus. In the first two Gospels (Matthew and Mark), they both join the crowd in mocking him. In the version of the Gospel of Luke, however, one taunts Jesus about not saving himself and them, and the other (known as the penitent thief) asks for mercy.

In apocryphal writings, the impenitent thief is given the name Gestas, which first appears in the Gospel of Nicodemus, while his companion is called Dismas. Christian tradition holds that Gestas was on the cross to the left of Jesus and Dismas was on the cross to the right of Jesus. In Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, the name of the impenitent thief is given as Gesmas. The impenitent thief is sometimes referred to as the &quot;bad thief&quot; in contrast to the good thief.

The apocryphal Arabic Infancy Gospel refers to Gestas and Dismas as Dumachus and Titus, respectively. According to tradition – seen, for instance, in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; – Dumachus was one of a band of robbers who attacked Saint Joseph and the Holy Family on their flight into Egypt.

==New Testament narrative==

The earliest version of the story is considered to be that in the Gospel of Mark, usually dated to around AD 70. The author says that two bandits were crucified with Jesus, one on each side of him. The passersby and chief priests mock Jesus for claiming to be the Messiah and yet being unable to save himself, and the two crucified with him join in. Some texts include a reference to the Book of Isaiah, citing this as a fulfilment of prophecy (Isaiah 53:12: &quot;And he... was numbered with the transgressors&quot;). The Gospel of Matthew, written around the year 85, repeats the same details.

In the Gospel of Luke version, however, from around 80–90, the details are varied: one of the bandits rebukes the other for mocking Jesus, and asks Jesus to remember him &quot;when you come into your kingdom&quot;. Jesus replies by promising him that he will be with him that same day in Paradise. Tradition has given this bandit the name of the penitent thief and the other the impenitent thief.

The Gospel of John, thought to be written about AD 90–95, also says that Jesus was crucified with two others, but in this account they are not described in more detail and their words are not recorded.

<doc id="319566" wikidata="Q1070944" url="?curid=319566" title="Chevelle (band)">
<text>Chevelle is an American rock band formed in Grayslake, Illinois, in 1995. The band was originally composed of two brothers, Pete Loeffler (lead vocals and guitar) and Sam Loeffler (drums and percussion), along with Matt Scott (bass and backing vocals). Scott was replaced by Sam and Pete&#x27;s brother, Joe Loeffler, in 1996. When Joe left the band in 2005, Geno Lenardo subbed in as the touring bassist until he was replaced by Pete and Sam&#x27;s brother-in-law, Dean Bernardini. Bernardini departed from the band in 2019, and in 2021, Kemble Walters joined the band as a touring bassist.

The band&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Point #1&quot;, was released on a small record label called Squint Entertainment. Chevelle&#x27;s second album, &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; (2002), was certified double platinum by the RIAA after a debut at No. 14 on the United States albums chart, &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)&quot; (2004), the band&#x27;s third album debuted at No. 8 and has been certified platinum. Chevelle has since released six more albums: &quot;Vena Sera&quot; (2007), &quot;Sci-Fi Crimes&quot; (2009), &quot;Hats Off to the Bull&quot; (2011), &quot;La Gárgola&quot; (2014), &quot;The North Corridor&quot; (2016), and &quot;NIRATIAS&quot; (2021). Other releases from Chevelle include two live albums, two DVDs, and two compilation albums. As of 2022 the band has sold over 6 million records.

== History ==

=== Formation, &quot;Point #1&quot;, and &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; (1995–2003) ===

Chevelle formed in 1995 in Grayslake, Illinois, when brothers Pete Loeffler and Sam Loeffler started enjoying and learning to play music. Pete started playing guitar and singing while Sam began playing drums in their parents&#x27; garage. Bassist Matt Scott was also in the band until 1996. Their youngest brother Joe Loeffler joined the band replacing Scott. Each of the band members were self-taught musicians. The name Chevelle came from the band members&#x27; passion for fast cars. It was also a car their father liked, the Chevrolet Chevelle. The band started playing small outdoor concerts and clubs around Chicago, Illinois, with Joe being only 14 years old.

Chevelle recorded a seven-track demo known as &quot;The Blue Album&quot;, released in 1998. The band played small concerts for the next three years until they were signed on to Steve Taylor&#x27;s Squint Entertainment, a contemporary Christian music label. The band recorded with Steve Albini for 17 days in Electrical Audio studios and released its first full-length album, &quot;Point #1&quot; in 1999. Two singles were released from the album with accompanying music videos, &quot;Point #1&quot; and &quot;Mia&quot;. The songs received GMA Dove Awards in 2000 and &quot;Point #1&quot; in 2001. The album received an award for &quot;Hard Music Album&quot; in 2000 by the Dove Awards. The album was well received by &quot;Phantom Tollbooth&quot; and &quot;HM Magazine&quot;, yet was criticized for its repetitive song structures by Jesus Freak Hideout, a Christian music website. The band&#x27;s label at the time was going through legal troubles as Word Records was attempting to wrest control of Squint from Taylor. This caused uncertainty with the band&#x27;s future. Discussing the legal battle, bassist Joe Loeffler stated &quot;we weren&#x27;t sure if anything was going to happen after that, it was pretty crazy.&quot;

Chevelle toured as support to bands such as Sevendust, Machine Head, Filter, and Powerman 5000 in this period. Squint Entertainment closed down in 2001 and the band signed with Epic Records in 2002. In 2002 Chevelle released its second studio album &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; on Epic Records. The band released the single &quot;The Red&quot;, which reached No. 3 on the Mainstream rock charts, and the video was played in regular rotation on MTV. &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; soon peaked at No. 14 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. Brian O&#x27;Neil of AllMusic stated the album &quot;offers uniqueness not often heard in more commercial fare, no mean feat.&quot; Chevelle released two more singles from the album, &quot;Closure&quot;, and &quot;Send the Pain Below&quot;, the latter of which reached the No. 1 position on both of the mainstream rock and modern rock charts. &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA with excess sales of one million copies sold in the United States alone in 2003. Chevelle was nominated for three awards at the 2003 Billboard Music Awards. One as a band and two for their song &quot;Send the Pain Below&quot;. The categories they were nominated for were Modern Rock Artist, Modern Rock Track, and Top Rock Song.

In 2003, Chevelle performed at Ozzfest, where the band recorded and later released its first live album, &quot;Live from the Road&quot;, and a live DVD, &quot;Live from the Norva&quot; on October 14, 2003. In 2003, the band was featured on the Music as a Weapon II tour with Disturbed. On the tour with Disturbed, Chevelle appeared on the tour compilation album, titled &quot;Music as a Weapon II&quot;, featuring the songs &quot;The Red&quot; and &quot;Forfeit&quot;. Keith Miller of EvangelSociety.org was critical of Chevelle for touring with Ozzfest with bands such as Cradle of Filth, who he claimed incorporated strong Satanic and anti-Christian themes into their lyrics. Chevelle held their first major headlining tour, from November 1 to December 17, 2003. The tour started in Cleveland and ended in Chicago. 

In 2004, Sam Loeffler said, &quot;It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s probably going to follow us around forever and that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s pretty simple. We originally signed with a record company that was backed by Word (a Christian label housing John Tesh and Amy Grant), so [&quot;Point #1&quot;] was in Christian bookstores. It was really an accidental thing&quot;. Sam also told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Our faith is still extremely important to us, but it&#x27;s also very personal. None of us feels being a rock band on stage should be a pedestal for preaching&quot;.

=== Line-up changes, &quot;This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)&quot;, and &quot;Vena Sera&quot; (2004–2008) ===
&quot;This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)&quot; was recorded in early 2004, and was released on September 21, 2004. The album debuted at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold by the RIAA six weeks later. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic described the songs on the album as &quot;strong dynamically, but sound predetermined — they don&#x27;t separate from the general loud rock malaise.&quot; The song &quot;Vitamin R (Leading Us Along)&quot; was released as the first single from the album and reached the No. 1 position on the Mainstream Rock chart. Two other singles were released from the album, the titles of which are &quot;The Clincher&quot; peaking at No. 3 on the Mainstream rock chart, and &quot;Panic Prone&quot; which peaked at No. 26 on the same chart. The band&#x27;s song &quot;The Clincher&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot;.

After the release of the album, the youngest of the brothers, Joe Loeffler, was dismissed from Chevelle. Due to different stories from the band members, it is unclear whether he was fired or left the band of his own accord. Pete and Sam stated the following on the band&#x27;s official website: &quot;After three years of non-stop touring and recording, Joe is taking a break to be home with family. We&#x27;ll miss having him on the road with us, but as his brothers and bandmates we respect his decision and are looking forward to getting out there and playing for the fans. See you on tour.&quot; However, according to Ultimate Guitar Archive, Joe said he was fired.

The band supported &quot;This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)&quot; with a headlining tour that included opening acts such as Taproot and Thirty Seconds to Mars, and continued playing small tours in 2005 with Geno Lenardo from the band Filter. In August 2005, the Loeffler brothers&#x27; brother-in-law and longtime friend, Dean Bernardini joined the band as their newest bassist. In 2006 Chevelle supported Nickelback for an arena tour across the United States.

In 2006, the band recorded their fourth studio album titled &quot;Vena Sera&quot;. The album was the first album Chevelle recorded with Bernardini. &quot;Vena Sera&quot; was released on April 3, 2007, debuting at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and sold 62,000 copies during its first week of release. The title of the album translates to &quot;vein liquid&quot; in Latin, representing the blood Chevelle put into making the album, according to Pete.

Corey Apar of AllMusic states that &quot;&quot;Vena Sera&quot; probably won&#x27;t disappoint fans, and it didn&#x27;t, if for the sole fact that it basically sounds just like Chevelle&#x27;s other albums&quot;. He noted that the song &quot;I Get It&quot; &quot;has a relatively lighter underbelly than the rest, which is a nice change of pace, but it&#x27;s ultimately too little, too late&quot;. &quot;Well Enough Alone&quot;, the first single from the album, was written about the departure of Joe Loeffler, and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream rock charts. Chevelle toured with Evanescence and Finger Eleven during March and April 2007, followed by a headlining tour with Finger Eleven and Strata in May and June. The second single from the album, &quot;I Get It&quot;, was released on June 12, 2007, and a video for the song debuted on MTV on November 27, 2007. In July of the same year, Chevelle toured Australia as a supporting act for the band The Butterfly Effect. On the tour in Australia, Chevelle&#x27;s band manager Rose died of cancer, much to the distress of the band.

On May 9, 2007, during a show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle&#x27;s trailer containing all of the band&#x27;s equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying. The band posted a notice saying, &quot;Most items are labeled &#x27;Chevelle&#x27; and if you notice anything suspicious on eBay or other online resellers selling &#x27;authentic&#x27; Chevelle items... guitar, basses, drums, amplifiers, risers, backdrops, tee shirts... please call the police...&quot; A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, &quot;Of the 14 guitars, we got two of &#x27;em, and then we got some amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it&#x27;s really, I mean it&#x27;s cool because it&#x27;s kind of like Christmas, only really weird. People have been calling us and saying, &#x27;Hey, I bought this or that&#x27;, and you know, we&#x27;re just doing our best to buy it back from them. And certainly the issue is not a money issue, it&#x27;s about having the pieces of gear that you did all your records with.&quot;

=== &quot;Sci-Fi Crimes&quot; and &quot;Hats Off to the Bull&quot; (2009–2012) ===

In 2009, Chevelle entered a studio in Nashville, Tennessee with producer Brian Virtue. Sam Loeffler stated, &quot;We have spent a lot of time making these songs something different from past records without losing the core of our passion. We are a hard rock, melodic band and it&#x27;s still what drives us as musicians.&quot; The new album, titled &quot;Sci-Fi Crimes&quot; was released on August 31, 2009, peaking at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart with sales of about 46,000, the highest entry onto the chart to date for the band. The album was praised by Jared Johnson of AllMusic for taking a step in a new direction in regards to the lyrics. Pete Loeffler normally wrote lyrics about personal subjects, however on &quot;Sci-Fi Crimes&quot;, he wrote of stories including apparitions, conspiracy theories, and erratic sleeping conditions. The tour following the release of &quot;Sci-Fi Crimes&quot; was in the late 2009. Halestorm opened for Chevelle on this tour. Chevelle also joined Halestorm, Staind, and Shinedown on &quot;Stimulate This!&quot; tour starting in July 2009.

In January 2011, Chevelle released a live CD/DVD combo, &quot;Any Last Words&quot;. The release was part of Chevelle&#x27;s ten-year anniversary as a recording band. As a special offer for fans, part of the pre-order package included a T-shirt and the fans&#x27; name in the &#x27;thank yous&#x27; part of the album booklet.

On December 6, 2011, Chevelle released &quot;Hats Off to the Bull&quot;, their sixth studio album. The album&#x27;s first single was titled &quot;Face to the Floor&quot;, which reached No. 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Rock songs chart. The album debuted at No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and sold 43,000 copies in its first week of release. Joe Barresi, who produced &quot;Hats Off to the Bull&quot; said of the album, &quot;Rather than simply subscribing to a tried-and-true formula, they made a conscious effort to incorporate new sounds and textures into their patented airtight anthems. As a result, &quot;Hats Off to the Bull&quot; is one of the group&#x27;s most infectious and impressive offerings to date.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Gregory Heaney stated the album is &quot;Heavy and dramatic, the album is packed full of tightly coiled, muscular riffs, giving the album a controlled feeling more like a slow burn than an explosive, cathartic release.&quot;

Chevelle was nominated for Rock Band of the Year at the 2012 Loudwire Music Awards. Also, a compilation album of band favorites called &quot;Stray Arrows: A Collection of Favorites&quot;, was released to stores on December 4, 2012. The compilation includes 11 songs and a previously unreleased track titled &quot;Fizgig&quot;. The Best Buy version has 15 songs and the track &quot;Fizgig&quot;.

=== Departure of Dean Bernardini, &quot;La Gárgola&quot;, and &quot;The North Corridor&quot; (2013–2019) ===

After wrapping up touring in support of &quot;Hats off to the Bull&quot; in 2013, Chevelle entered the studio to record their seventh album, re-teaming with Joe Barresi to produce the album. Recording and production finished early in 2014, and the band announced on February 1 that the album, to be released April 1, 2014, would be titled &quot;La Gárgola&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the gargoyle&quot;). Lead singer Pete Loeffler describes that the album is about &quot;the dark underbelly of American culture.&quot; The first single from the album, titled &quot;Take Out the Gunman&quot;, was released on February 3, 2014. The other singles from the album are &quot;Hunter Eats Hunter&quot; and &quot;An Island&quot;. The album reached the top of the Rock Album chart in April 2014. Chevelle was nominated for four awards at the 2014 Loudwire Music Awards. The categories were, Best Rock Band, Best Rock Album (&quot;La Gárgola&quot;), Best Bassist (Dean Bernardini), and Best Rock Song (&quot;Take Out the Gunman&quot;).

In an interview with 105.7 The Point on May 23, 2015, the band stated that after their last show of their tour in St. Louis, they would focus on writing new material, and that future work would be moving in a heavier-sounding direction.

On May 10, 2016, the band announced that their new album will be titled &quot;The North Corridor&quot;, which was released on July 8, 2016. The first single from the album is &quot;Joyride (Omen)&quot; which became their fifth song to reach No. 1 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. The others two singles from the album are &quot;Door to Door Cannibals&quot; and &quot;Rivers&quot;. In October 2018, Chevelle released a compilation album titled, &quot;12 Bloody Spies&quot;, featuring B-sides, covers, rarities, and remixes. On August 1, 2019, the band launched a craft beer in collaboration with Revolution Brewing. The beer the band launched is a German-style Helles Lager and is called La Gárgola named after the band&#x27;s seventh album. On September 20, 2019, Bernardini announced his departure from the band.

=== &quot;NIRATIAS&quot; and upcoming tenth studio album (2019–present) ===

In June 2019, the band announced that they entered the studio with long-time producer Joe Barresi. Along with the announcement drummer Sam Loeffler said they have been writing material a year-and-a-half, meaning the process of making this album has taken longer than usual. In an interview with KCAL 96.7&#x27;s RadioActive Mike Z. in September 2019, vocalist Pete Loeffler stated:

On November 8, 2020, the band released an acoustic version of the new song &quot;Endlessly&quot;. The band released a music video for their new song, &quot;Self Destructor&quot; on January 8, 2021. The song is the lead single from their upcoming ninth studio album, &quot;NIRATIAS&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Nothing is real and this is a simulation&quot;) which was released on March 5, 2021. On January 29, 2021, the band released the second single from the album, &quot;Peach&quot;. On February 19, 2021, the band released the third single from the album, &quot;Remember When&quot;. On March 5, 2021, the band released the fourth single from the album, &quot;Endlessly&quot;. On March 8, 2021, the band announced that ÆGES guitarist and vocalist, Kemble Walters is their new touring bassist.

In a March 17, 2021, interview with Loudwire, Pete Loeffler states that despite the band selling over six million albums, they haven&#x27;t gotten any money out of it. The money all went back to Epic. He blames it on signing a bad contract early on in his career. On May 1, 2021, the band released a music video for the song &quot;Mars Simula&quot;. &quot;Self Destructor&quot; was included in the 2021 film, &quot;Hitman&#x27;s Wife&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot;. The band toured in September and November 2021 in promotion of the album, calling the tour, &quot;The &quot;NIRATIAS&quot; Tour&quot;. The November dates were later canceled and the band stated it was due to &quot;changing circumstances beyond our control.&quot; In 2022, the band was nominated for Rock Artist of the Year at the iHeartRadio Music Awards.

In April 2022, the band canceled one concert and postponed another due to Sam testing positive for COVID-19. In June 2022, the band announced that they were entering the studio to record their tenth studio album in November or December, with plans of releasing the album in 2023. It will be their first release without a major record label due to their contract with Epic Records ending. In March 2023, the band confirmed they were in the studio recording their new album. The band went on a US tour in September 2023 with Three Days Grace and Loathe. In July 2024, the band announced that they signed with a new record label, Alchemy Recordings, and that their tenth album was tentatively due to come out in September or October that year. However, both release dates were missed and the album was delayed to 2025.

== Musical style and influences ==
Chevelle has been classified as hard rock, alternative metal, alternative rock, post-grunge, nu metal, and indie rock.
The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Point #1&quot; has been described as indie rock. The band&#x27;s most popular albums, &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; and &quot;This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)&quot;, are both described as nu metal. &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; had been described as having a radio-friendly sound. Albums such as &quot;La Gargola&quot; and &quot;The North Corridor&quot; feature a heavier, more riff-oriented sound with lyrical themes influenced by horror. Their ninth studio album &quot;NIRATIAS&quot; incorporated elements of progressive rock and art rock along with a science-fiction theme.

Their primary musical influences as stated by the band members are Helmet, Tool, and The Cure. Chevelle has frequently been compared to Tool throughout its career. Pete Loeffler&#x27;s singing voice was stated to sound similar to that of Tool&#x27;s Maynard James Keenan, and the band&#x27;s music has been compared to Tool&#x27;s &quot;soft-loud vocal dynamics.&quot; According to Lauren Wise of &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;, &quot;[Chevelle have] never strayed far from their controlled chaos and somehow gentle rampage or their mix of dark magnetism and gothic pop (think early Tool meets The Cure if you haven&#x27;t heard radio-dominating hits like &quot;The Red&quot;).&quot;

Despite comparisons to Tool, many critics such as Andree Farias and Andy Argyrakis of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; have stated Chevelle as having a unique sound to their music. Andree Farias of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; has reviewed Chevelle&#x27;s first three albums, praising them as &quot;commanding vocals over jolting guitars and chest-thumping bass beats&quot;. In discussing the band&#x27;s sound throughout their career, Raul Stanciu of &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; stated, &quot;It amazes me how Chevelle manage to maintain such a consistent output...[they&#x27;re] always tweaking the overall sound in small amounts, so that you’ll be constantly surprised.&quot; Chevelle&#x27;s music has also been described as &quot;a kind of controlled chaos, a beautiful darkness, a gentle rampage of aural velocity.&quot;

<doc id="319567" wikidata="Q3328768" url="?curid=319567" title="Music of Sri Lanka">
<text>The music of [[Sri Lanka]] has its roots in five primary influences: ancient folk rituals, Hindu religious traditions, Buddhist religious traditions, the legacy of European colonisation, and the commercial and historical influence of nearby Indian culture—specifically, Kollywood cinema and Bollywood cinema.

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in Sri Lanka, landing in the mid-15th century. They brought with them traditional cantiga ballads, ukuleles and guitars, as well as conscripted Africans (referred to, historically, as &quot;kaffrinhas&quot;), who spread their own style of music known as baila. The influence of both European and African traditions served to further diversify the musical roots of contemporary Sri Lankan music.

== Folk music ==
Caste-based folk poems, &quot;Jana Kavi&quot;, originated as communal song shared within individual groups as they engaged in daily work. Today, they remain a popular form of cultural expression. Folk poems were sung by ancient people of Sri Lanka to minimise their loneliness, sadness, tiredness etc. There isn&#x27;t a known author for the folk poems. Kavi was also sung to accompany annual rituals. These ancient rites are rarely performed in contemporary Sri Lanka, but the preserved songs are still performed by folk musicians. Sri Lanka is known to have songs that date back to 1400 A.D. That are still performed today.

Another traditional Sri Lankan folk style is called the &quot;Virindu&quot;. It involves an improvised poem sung to the beaten melody of a rabana. Traditional song contests were held in which two virindu singers would compete through spontaneous verse. The Portuguese influenced baila has been a popular folk tradition along the coastal districts in the past five hundred years and is now part of the mainstream music culture.

== Sri Lankan country music ==
The art, music and dances of Sri Lanka were derived from ritualistic responses to natural phenomenon. Sri Lanka&#x27;s earliest folk music was later influenced by the influx of Buddhist traditions. These songs were performed by commoners, and not merely recited by the priestly castes.

=== Pageantry ===
Sri Lanka has a highly evolved pageantry tradition, which has a unique array of music.

=== Kolam and puppetry ===
Kolam music is a low country folk tradition of the south-west coast and its use was both in exorcism rituals as a form of healing and in masked comedy and drama.

=== Nurthi Music ===
Nurthi is a stage drama that influenced by Parsi theater as a consequence of arriving the drama troupe in the latter part of the 19th century, which belonged to the Elphinstone Dramatic Company of India. Nurthi is the colloquial Sinhala form of the Sanskrit term &quot;Nritya&quot;. The music of Nurthi was based on North Indian Music. Don Bastian of Dehiwala introduced Nurti firstly by looking at Indian dramas and then John De Silva developed it and performed Ramayanaya in 1886.

=== Sinhala light music ===
Some artists visited India to learn music and later started introducing light music. Ananda Samarakoon was the pioneer of this attempt also composing the Sri Lankan National Anthem. Then Sunil Santha who also did not stick to Hindustani music introduced light music of his own, influenced by the Geethika (Christian hymns) tradition of Sri Lanka. Pandit W.D. Amaradeva is credited as the major contributor to the development of this genre into a truly Sri Lankan style, along with Amarasiri Peiris.

It is enriched with the influence of folk music, kolam music, Nadagam music, Noorthy music and others too. Most of the musician in Sri Lanka have come out with their own creations. The temple paintings and carvings used birds, elephants, wild animals, flowers and trees. The colors were made of nature. The traditional 18 dances display the dancing of birds and animals.
* Mayura Wannama – The dance of the peacock
* Hanuma Wannama – The dance of the monkey
* Gajaga Wannama – The dance of the elephant
* Thuraga Wannama – The dance of the horse

It has several subgenres. The folk music is created with few instruments only and the frequency range is narrowly. The folk songs and poems were used in social gatherings to work together. The Indian influenced Classical Music has grown to be unique.
The traditional drama, music and songs are typically Sri Lankan.

=== Sri Lanka&#x27;s traditional musical instruments ===
The classical Sinhalese Orchestra consists of five categories of instruments. The drum is the king of local percussion instruments and without it, there will be no dance.
The vibrant beat of the rhythm of the drums form the basic of the dance. The dancers&#x27; feet bounce off the floor and they leap and swirl in patterns that reflex the complex rhythms of the drum beat.

This drum beat may seem simple on the first hearing but it takes a long time to master the intricate rhythms and variations, which the drummer sometimes can bring to a crescendo of intensity.

* Gatabera - The typical Sinhalese Dance is identified as the Kandyan dance and the Gatabera is indispensable to this dance. It is a long, double-headed drum with a bulge in the middle, worn around the player&#x27;s waist.
* Yak-bera - The Yak-bera (&quot;demon drum&quot;) is used in low country dance, in which the dancers wear masks and perform devil dancing, which has become a highly developed form of art. This is a double-headed drum with a cylinderic wooden frame.
* Dawula - The Dawula is a barrel shaped drum indigenous to the Sabaragamuwa dance style. It is used as an accompanying drum in the past in order to keep strict time with the beat.
* Thammattama - The Thammattama is a flat, two faced drum. The drummer strikes the drum on the two surfaces on top with sticks, unlike the other traditional Sri Lankan drums, which are played by striking the sides of the instrument. In the Hewisi Ensemble, this may be a companion drum to the aforementioned Dawula.
* Udekki - A small double headed, hourglass shape hand drum used to accompany songs. It is approximately in length. The face, valayama, is not used to produce sound rather by pressure applied on the string. The middle of the drum, giriya or gela, which means neck in Sinhalese, is narrower than the faces.
* Rabana - The Rabana is a flat faced circular drum and comes in several sizes. The largest of which has to be placed on the floor in order to be played – which is usually done by several people (normally the womenfolk) who sit around the instrument and beat it with both hands. This is used in festivals such as the Sinhalese New Year and ceremonies such as weddings. The resounding beat of the Rabana symbolizes the joyous moods of the occasion. The small Rabana is a form of mobile drum beat – carried by the performer to produce accompanying drum rhythms for the pieces being performed.
* Thalampata - The Thalampata are the metal percussion instruments, where two small cymbals are joined by a string.
* Horanawa - The Horanawa, or Kandyan pipe, is an oboe-like double reed instrument that is played during traditional ceremonies in Buddhist temples to accompany the percussive instruments and dance. The mouthpiece is traditionally made of a talipot palm leaf and the remaining sections of jackwood and brass.
* Hakgediya - The Hakgediya is conch-shell and another form of a natural instrument. The instrument&#x27;s primary function is for the performer to play it (by blowing) to announce the opening of ceremonies of grandeur.
* Wind Section - The wind section is dominant by a wind instrument, something akin to the clarinet. This instrument is not normally used for the dances mainly because the Sinhalese dance is not set to music as the western world knows it. Rather, the primary sense of rhythm, and patterns of man in motion, is the music that is beaten out by the drummer.
* Flutes - The flutes made of metals such as silver and brass produce shrill music to accompany Kandyan Dances, while the plaintive strains of music of the reed flute may pierce the air in devil-dancing.

== Endemic Instruments ==

=== Béra ===
According to the historical record available today, it is believed that several instruments originated within the tribal groups that once inhabited the island presently known as Sri Lanka. Among these, seven remain in use:

* – Also referred to as the &quot;Kandyan drum&quot; or &quot;wedding drum&quot;; it is a double-headed, barrel-shaped drum, that is played by hand. It is approximately in length, in diameter (at its widest point), with diameter drumheads.
* Thammátama – A twin-drum (similar to the bongo) that is played with two sticks instead of by hand.
* Yak Béra – Also referred to as the &quot;Low Country drum&quot; or &quot;Demon drum&quot;; it is a double-headed, barrel-shaped drum, that is played by both hands (one in one side).
* Udákkiya – A small, hour-glass shaped drum, that is played with one hand while the other hand modifies the tension of a cloth wrapped around its centre (thereby changing the pitch of the drum-head).
* Hand Răbāna – A drum similar to the tambourine (except in that it does not possess metal jingles)
* Daŭla or &quot;Dawla&quot; – A double-headed, barrel-shaped drum played by hand (on one side), and by a stick (on the opposite side).
* Bench Răbāna – Similar to the &quot;hand rabana&quot;, except larger (it is often played by three to eight individuals simultaneously).

In addition to these drums, a new drum was recently created (in 2000) by Sri Lankan musician Kalasoori Piyasāra Shilpadhipathi, referred to as the Gaŭla – it is a barrel-shaped instrument containing one head from the &quot;Gáta Béra&quot;, and one from the Daŭla. A set of rudiments (practice rhythms) were also created by him to accommodate the instrument&#x27;s unique tone.

Also in addition to these drums, the dhōlki is also used by many musicians – though this drum is believed to have descended from those brought to Sri Lanka from India – unlike the aforementioned instruments; which are believed to have existed in Sri Lanka prior to the arrival of the first Indian explorers (though this is difficult to verify due to the proximity of the two nations to one another – it is impossible to say, with any degree of certainty, that no cultural exchange occurred between the peoples of southern India and Sri Lanka prior to any particular date in history).

=== Ravanahatha ===

The Ravanahatha is a crude violin made of coconut shell, bamboo and goat skin, with a natural fibre serving as the string. Goat and sheep gut and coconut wood are also used. It is believed to be the first stringed instrument to be played with a bow and is recognized as the world&#x27;s first violin.

The Ravanahatha or Ravana&#x27;s hand is mentioned in the ancient Indian epic &#x27;Ramayana&#x27;. The Ravanahatha sounds like the north Indian instruments Sarangi and Esraj.
Dinesh Subasinghe has re-introduced this instrument to Sri Lankan media in 2007 and launched the first CD using the instrument, &quot;Rawana Nada&quot;.
== Western music ==
Western classical music has been studied and performed in Sri Lanka since its introduction during the Portuguese colonial period of the 15th century. The upper middle-class and upper-class citizens of the country traditionally formed the pedagogues, students, and audience of the Western classical tradition in the country, although western music is also offered as a subject at secondary schools and at tertiary level. The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka is one of the oldest western orchestras in South Asia. The foundation of the National Youth Orchestra has helped increase interest and participation more widely in society and among young people outside Colombo. Many Sri Lankans have continued to reach the upper echelons of classical performance, including world-renowned cellist Rohan de Saram, pianist Rohan de Silva, and many other composers, organists, and orchestral performers.

==Recorded music==
The earliest stars of Sri Lankan recorded music came from the theater at a time when the traditional open-air drama (referred to in Sinhala as , or ) remained the most popular form of entertainment. A 1903 album, entitled Nurthi, is the first recorded album to come out of Sri Lanka via Radio Ceylon. The station, which had long held a monopoly over Sri Lanka&#x27;s airwaves, had been established in 1925, and one of Sri Lanka&#x27;s pioneering broadcasters, Vernon Corea, almost immediately grasped the opportunity to introduce Sri Lankan Music on the English Services of Radio Ceylon.

In the wake of western and Indian proliferation in music, composer and singer Ananda Samarakoon emerged from training at Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s school at Shanthiketalan to develop a uniquely Sinhalese music tradition in 1939. His work such as &quot;Punchi Suda&quot;, &quot;Ennada Manike&quot; and notably &quot;Namo Namo Maata&quot; (adapted as Sri Lanka&#x27;s national anthem later) was a landmark of the Sinhalese song, which was known as Sarala Gee later. Another artist Devar Surya Sena with his Western education was pivotal in popularising folk songs of Sri Lanka to the English elite that bore higher status in the country at the time.

&quot;Kadawunu Poronduwa&quot; in 1947 brought about a film industry in Sri Lanka. In the late 1940s and 1950s Sinhalese film music became the most popular with audiences; it was drawn heavily upon melodies found in Hindi and Tamil films – adapted to a Sri Lankan audience by substituting their original lyrics with Sinhala lyrics. Meanwhile, musicians like W. D. Amaradeva, Sunil Santha, W. B. Makuloluwa etc. began experimenting with developing a Sinhalese music style.

Sunil Santha took a Western approach in his work inspired from Church music. He opposed of getting elements from Hindustani &quot;Raaga&quot; music to develop Sinhalese music. This was evident when he was later banned from Radio Ceylon after refusing to audition for Indian musician Ratanjankar, whom the corporation had brought from South India to oversee the direction of music on their stations.

Pandit Amaradeva, trained at Bhatkhande Vidyapith, Lucknow, India, took up the &quot;Sarala Gee&quot; tradition along with experimentation of raaga forms and folk music. This became popular in the country especially through sarala gee programs broadcast in Radio Ceylon. Musicians such as Victor Ratnayake, Sanath Nandasiri, T. Shelton Perera, Gunadasa Kapuge, Rohana Weerasinghe, Stanley Peiris, Austin Munasinghe, Sunil Edirisinghe, Edward Jayakody, Amarasiri Peiris and Rookantha Gunathilake brought the system forward the Shelton Premaratne and Lionel Algama are two musicians, who added new dimensions to Sinhalese music.

W. B. Makulolouwa and C de S Kulatilake, believed Sinhalese music should follow the traditions of its folk music called &quot;Jana Gee&quot;. Makuloluwa gathered a great many of Sinhalese folk poems traveling around the country and tried to develop a unique style. Late musicians like Lionel Ranwala, Rohana Beddage contributed in developing Makuloluwa&#x27;s &quot;Jana Gee&quot; style.

Premasiri Khemadasa also known as &quot;Khemadasa Master&quot; was one of the most influential composers in Sri Lankan music. Inspiring from Western Classical music, Hindustani music and also Sinhalese folk music he composed in his own style which has been popular since late 1960s. He was one of the most highly regarded film, stage and TV drama composers and his music is still used by the best directors in the country.

Pivotal to the works of these musicians were songwriters like Mahagama Sekara and Chandraratne Manawasinghe who in their lyrics presented deeply poetic, and honestly expressed, ideas – many of which also promoted a sense of nationalism in a nation that had received independence less than a generation before in 1948.

With the dawn of the 1960s and government restrictions on travel to India original compositions became in vogue in film music though a few popular films continued to tout stolen melodies under the hands of music arrangers like P. L. A. Somapala and Mohomed Sally.

The mid-1960s, saw the introduction of &quot;pop&quot; groups such as Los Cabelleros led by Neville Fernando, La Ceylonians led by Noel Ranasinghe (widely known as &quot;King of Sri Lankan Calypso&quot;), The La Bambas, The Humming Birds and Los Muchachos; all of whom played calypso-style baila borrowing their style from Caribbean folk-singer Harry Belafonte. This mixture of Caribbean calypso with native baila was dominated by two groups: The Moonstones, and The Golden Chimes led by musicians Annesley Malewana and Clarence Wijewardena.

Sri Lankan pop/film music managed to hold a large portion of Sri Lanka&#x27;s market during the late 1960s and early 1970s, but by 1980, Indian film music had again displaced local musicians as the highest-selling sector of the Sri Lankan music industry. In the 1980s the disco-pop musician Rookantha Gunathilake emerged to become one of the most popular artists of the time. Many young musicians followed Rookantha and his style in 1980s and 1990s.
After 2000, young musicians like Kasun Kalhara, Bathiya and Santhush and Shihan Mihiranga continued the pop song stream introducing new features into it. After 2008 Darshana Ruwan Disanayaka, Nadeeka Guruge, Dinesh Subasinghe has done some inspiring works &amp; become the most influential composers in Sri Lankan cinema after achieving many awards in film festivals.

MIDI/Computer based music performances and recording were introduced to Sri Lanka in the 1980s by Keyboardist/composer Diliup Gabadamudalige. He was the first to use a complete MIDI based performing keyboard setup and also use MIDI/Sequencers and Music software/Computer based music recording and performances in Sri Lanka. Diliups contribution has been recognized by the Government of Sri Lanka and he has been awarded the Kalashuri title and was also awarded the first Lyle Godrich Memorial Award for Contribution to the western Music Industry in Sri Lanka in 2011.

The Gypsies has remained a popular band for over four decades and the Sunflowers is the most widely recorded group for nearly three decades.

Since 1998, many pop/R&amp;B groups have emerged in Sri Lanka – the most prominent of which is known as Bathiya and Santhush—who draw inspiration from the Euro pop groups that visited the island. Among their accomplishments; they are the first Sri Lankan group to be signed to an international record label (Sony BMG), and were an integral component in the label&#x27;s entrance into the nation&#x27;s music industry in 2002/2003. They have received international awards for their compositions, and have performed in several countries – including on BBC radio in the UK.

Dinesh Subasinghe&#x27;s film score for &quot;Ho Gana Pokuna&quot; became a popular &amp; a memorable score in Sri Lankan cinema in 2016, he has won awards in all the cinema festivals held in Sri Lanka in 2016

The cross-genre works of contemporary composer-pianist Tanya Ekanayaka involving compositions for solo piano with references to folk and traditional melodies from around the world as well as all 18 Sri Lankan vannams and many Sri Lankan traditional melodies have been released worldwide by Naxos Records since 2015. Her compositions have been broadcast on international media across the world, have often been the first by any Sri Lankan composer to be performed at international venues and she is the first and to date only Sri Lankan composer to have entire albums of original music released worldwide by an international record label.

==Sinhala music archives==
Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (Former Radio Ceylon) is considered as the largest Sinhala Music archive. Some other private archives, such as Lanka Music Archive,
are there that promote Sinhala country music commercially or non-commercially.

== Rock and heavy metal music ==
Rock Music in Sri Lanka dates back to the early 1970s. Kumar Navaratnam and Gabo Peiris staged the first Rock Festivals at the Havelock Park in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Kumara Navaratnam introduced rock and hard rock music to Sri Lankan audiences and was important in the evolving rock music scene then along with others like Prins Jayaratnam and the Unwanted Generation, Prasanna Abeysekara&#x27;s Coffin Nail, Neville of Acid, Gobbledegook and Sweetie Pie, which was led by pianist Nimal Goonawardane, Mary was the only Rock band to play all original music at that time and was led by Ravi Balasooriya of &quot;Bugs&quot; fame. Other members being Aruna Siriwardane, Benjy Ranabahu, Dilup Gabadamudalige and Dwight Van Gramberg. Ramesh Weeratunga, who was a composer/solo performer of this period, went on to become a professional musician/songwriter in Germany, releasing several solo albums.

=== History ===
Most Sri Lankan music enthusiasts relied on radio programs such as &quot;Progressive 30&quot; presented by Noeline Mendis to follow the state of music during the 1970s, or listened to vinyl records at the British Council and the American Center. A minority of senior college students had access to vinyl LPs and music trade papers. &quot;Rock Company&quot;, a club which brought together Rock enthusiasts in Sri Lanka and provided exposure to upcoming talent had its origins during this period. College students acquired guitars, drum kits, keyboards, hired rudimentary sound systems and began to attempt to recreate artists they admired.

The first Rock events in Sri Lanka centered on bands such as &quot;The Unwanted Generation&quot;, &quot;Graveyard&quot; and &quot;Coffin Nail, &quot; which introduced Colombo&#x27;s youth culture to the underground music of the UK and the US. These featured such musicians as Prins Jayaratnam, Chris Dhasan, Nimal Gunawardena, Ramesh Weeratunga, Imtiaz Hameed and Kumar Navaratnam who were inspired by &quot;Wall Band and Gun Chorus&quot;.

&quot;Cancer,&quot; led by Prasanna Abeysekera and his brother Ranil, was the first Sri Lankan band to compose and play original music in the genre. The band was accompanied by musicians that included Brian Knower, Leo Pasquale, Sumedha Kulatunga and enthusiasts. Its exposure was limited by the lack of recording facilities and means to market itself. &quot;Cancer&quot; and similar bands played at &quot;Koko&#x27;s&quot; at Thimbirigasyaya. Bands such as &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; and &quot;Venom&quot; followed, playing covers of hard rock in similar settings.

&quot;Rock Company&quot;, and rock music in Sri Lanka declined as pioneering musicians emigrated, or were drawn away by family and economic demands during the late 1980s. Bands such as Rattlesnake, Venom, Cancer and Brass Face continued to perform.

In 2003 Rock Company was later begun again by Ajith Perera and aided newer bands such as &quot;Independence Square&quot; and &quot;Kreb&#x27;s Cycle.&quot;, organizing concerts and providing funding. It publishes a journal and maintains a practice studio.

=== Contemporary rock and metal ===

Sri Lanka now has a significant underground metal and hard rock community, which is growing in popularity among upper-middle-class teenagers and young adults. Some internationally known Sri Lankan metal bands include Stigmata, Paranoid Earthling, Plecto Aliquem Capite. Many other bands too have emerged ever since the 1990s making the heavy metal underground much bigger. While Colombo is where hard rock bands like Stigmata originated, Kandy gave rise to the pioneer grunge outfit Paranoid Earthling, which was the first rock band to emerge from the Hill Capital. Kandy is also known for black metal bands like &quot;Forlorn Hope&quot; &quot;Pariah Demise&quot; &quot;Necro Horde&quot; &quot;Goatmunition&quot; and some doom metal bands as well.

In September 2019, Sri Lanka&#x27;s first Metal album by a female – &quot;Fountain of Memory&quot; was released by Shehara Jayatilaka Napoleon.

<text>Zhang Fei () (; died July or August 221 AD), courtesy name Yide (益德), was a Chinese military general and politician serving under the warlord Liu Bei in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period of China. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, who were among the earliest to join Liu Bei, shared a brotherly relationship with their lord and accompanied him on most of his early exploits. Zhang Fei fought in various battles on Liu Bei&#x27;s side, including the Red Cliffs campaign (208–209), takeover of Yi Province (212–214), and Hanzhong Campaign (217–218). He was assassinated by his subordinates in 221 after serving for only a few months in the state of Shu Han, which was founded by Liu Bei earlier that year.

Zhang Fei is one of the major characters in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which dramatises and romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Zhang Fei became sworn brothers with Liu Bei and Guan Yu in the fictional Oath of the Peach Garden at the start of the novel and remained faithful to their oath until his death.

==Early career==
Zhang Fei was from Zhuo Commandery. In the 180s, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, he and Guan Yu became Liu Bei&#x27;s followers. As Guan Yu was several years older than Zhang Fei, Zhang regarded him as an elder brother. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were known as stalwart and strong men; which made them talented fighters.

When Liu Bei was later appointed as the Chancellor of Pingyuan State () by the Han central government, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu served as Majors of Separate Command () under him. Liu Bei cherished them as if they were his own brothers and the three of them shared a brotherly relationship to the point of sharing the same room, sleeping on the same mat and eating from the same pot. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu acted as bodyguards for Liu Bei. They followed him on his exploits and were always ready to face any danger and hardship.

==Conflict between Liu Bei and Lü Bu==
In 194, Liu Bei succeeded Tao Qian as the Governor of Xu Province. The following year, he led his forces to Huaiyin County, to counter an invasion by Yuan Shu. During this time, he left Zhang Fei behind to guard Xiapi, the capital of Xu Province.

Zhang Fei wanted to kill Cao Bao, a former officer under Tao Qian, for reasons unknown. Cao Bao fled back to his own camp and set up defences while sending a messenger to request aid from Lü Bu, another warlord who was taking shelter under Liu Bei at the time. Lü Bu led his forces to attack Xiapi and succeeded in seizing control of Xiapi. Zhang Fei fled after losing Xiapi to Lü Bu.

Liu Bei returned to Xu Province, which was now under Lü Bu&#x27;s control, and reluctantly accepted Lü Bu&#x27;s offer to move to Xiaopei while Lü Bu remained in Xiapi. Tensions between Liu Bei and Lü Bu increased until the point of conflict. Liu Bei sought help from Cao Cao, a warlord who controlled the Han central government. Cao Cao and Liu Bei combined forces and defeated Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi in 198, after which they returned to the imperial capital Xu together. In Xu, Zhang Fei was appointed as a General of the Household ().

==Roaming the land with Liu Bei==
In 199, Liu Bei pretended to volunteer to lead an army to attack Yuan Shu, and used that opportunity to leave Xu and escape from Cao Cao&#x27;s watch. He headed to Xu Province, killed Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao, and seized control of Xiapi again. The following year, Cao Cao personally led his forces to attack Liu Bei, defeated him, and took back control of Xu Province. After his defeat, Liu Bei fled to Ji Province, where he took refuge under Cao Cao&#x27;s rival, Yuan Shao.

Liu Bei later left Yuan Shao by pretending to help Yuan Shao gain support from local rebels in Runan in his war against Cao Cao. He eventually found shelter under Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province. Liu Biao put him in charge of Xinye County on the northern border of Jing Province.

It is not known whether Zhang Fei followed Liu Bei to join Yuan Shao after Liu Bei&#x27;s defeat in Xu Province, or whether he, like Guan Yu, was separated from Liu Bei during that period of time.

==Red Cliffs campaign==
===Battle of Changban===


In 208, following Liu Biao&#x27;s death, Cao Cao launched a military campaign aimed at wiping out opposing forces in Jing Province and the Jiangdong (or Wu) region. In the meantime, Liu Bei evacuated Xinye County and led his followers towards Xiakou, which was controlled by Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son, Liu Qi.

Cao Cao was worried that Liu Bei would occupy Jiangling County, which was abundant in military resources, before he did. He immediately ordered his troops to leave behind their heavy equipment and baggage, and move swiftly to Xiangyang. When Cao Cao reached Xiangyang, Liu Biao&#x27;s younger son and successor, Liu Cong, surrendered to him without putting up resistance. After learning that Liu Bei had already passed by Xiangyang, Cao Cao personally led a 5,000-strong elite cavalry force to pursue Liu Bei. After travelling over 300 &quot;li&quot; in just one day and one night, Cao Cao and his riders caught up with Liu Bei at Changban and attacked him. During the battle, Liu Bei abandoned his family and fled, with only Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and a small number of soldiers accompanying him. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces captured many of Liu Bei&#x27;s followers and his equipment.

Zhang Fei led 20 horsemen to cover Liu Bei&#x27;s retreat. After destroying a bridge, he stood guard at one end (facing the enemy), brandished his spear, glared at the enemy and shouted: &quot;I&#x27;m Zhang Yide. You can come forth and fight me to the death!&quot; Cao Cao&#x27;s soldiers were all afraid and did not dare to approach him. Liu Bei and his followers were hence able to retreat safely.

===Battle of Red Cliffs and after===
In 208, Liu Bei and Sun Quan combined forces and defeated Cao Cao at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. Liu Bei later took control of southern Jing Province, with his headquarters at Nan Commandery and Gong&#x27;an County. Zhang Fei was appointed General Who Attacks Barbarians () and Administrator () of Yidu Commandery. He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xin Village (). He was later reassigned to serve as the Administrator of Nan Commandery.

==Yi Province campaign==
===Earlier defence of Jing Province===
In 211, Liu Bei led an army to Yi Province to assist the governor Liu Zhang in countering the advances of a rival warlord, Zhang Lu of Hanzhong Commandery. He left Zhang Fei and others behind to guard Jing Province in his absence. Earlier in 209, Liu Bei married Sun Quan&#x27;s younger sister Lady Sun to strengthen the alliance between him and Sun Quan. Because of her brother&#x27;s strong influence, Lady Sun was arrogant and she allowed her close aides to behave lawlessly. Even Liu Bei was afraid of her. When Sun Quan heard that Liu Bei had left for Yi Province, he sent a vessel to Jing Province to fetch his sister home. Lady Sun attempted to bring along Liu Bei&#x27;s son Liu Shan with her, but Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun led their men to stop her and managed to retrieve Liu Shan.

===Conquest of Yi Province===
Around 212, relations between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang deteriorated to the point of conflict, when Liu Bei started a campaign aimed at seizing Yi Province from Liu Zhang. Liu Bei ordered Zhuge Liang, Zhao Yun, Zhang Fei and others to lead reinforcements into Yi Province to help him, while Guan Yu remained behind to defend Jing Province. When Liu Zhang heard that Liu Bei received reinforcements from Jing Province, he dispatched Zhang Yi (Junsi) with an army to stop them at Deyang County. However, Zhang Fei defeated them and forced Zhang Yi to withdraw back to Chengdu.

Along the way, Zhang Fei attacked Jiangzhou, which was defended by Zhao Zan (趙筰) the Administrator of Ba Commandery along with his more famous subordinate Yan Yan, a military officer serving under Liu Zhang. He defeated both of them and captured Yan Yan alive. Zhang Fei asked him: &quot;When my army showed up, why did you put up resistance instead of surrendering?&quot; Yan Yan replied: &quot;You people launched an unwarranted attack on my home province. There may be generals in my province who will lose their heads, but there are none who will surrender.&quot; Zhang Fei was enraged and he ordered Yan Yan&#x27;s execution. An expressionless Yan Yan asked: &quot;If you want to chop off my head, then do it! What&#x27;s with that outburst of anger?&quot; Zhang Fei was so impressed with Yan Yan&#x27;s courage that he released him and treated him like an honoured guest.

Zhang Fei&#x27;s army then proceeded to break through Liu Zhang&#x27;s defences until they reached Chengdu (Yi Province&#x27;s capital), where they rendezvoused with Liu Bei and the others. In 214, Liu Zhang surrendered and yielded Yi Province to Liu Bei. Liu Bei rewarded Zhuge Liang, Fa Zheng, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu each with 500 &quot;jin&quot; of gold, 1,000 &quot;jin&quot; of silver, 50 million coins and 1,000 rolls of silk. Zhang Fei was also appointed as the Administrator () of Baxi Commandery.

==Hanzhong Campaign==
===Battle of Baxi===
In around 215, Cao Cao attacked and defeated Zhang Lu, after which Hanzhong Commandery came under his control. Cao Cao left Xiahou Yuan, Zhang He and others behind to defend Hanzhong while he returned to Ye.

During that time, Zhang He led his forces to attack Baxi Commandery with the aim of forcing Baxi&#x27;s residents to relocate to Hanzhong Commandery. His army passed through Dangqu (), Mengtou () and Dangshi () counties, and encountered Zhang Fei&#x27;s troops. Both sides held their positions for over 50 days, after which Zhang Fei led about 10,000 elite soldiers and took an alternative route to attack Zhang He. As the mountain paths were very narrow and inaccessible, Zhang He&#x27;s army was effectively divided into two because the troops at the front and the rear were unable to contact and assist each other, resulting in a victory for Zhang Fei. Zhang He and about ten of his men escaped on foot through a shortcut and retreated back to Nanzheng. Peace was restored in Baxi Commandery.

===Conquest of Hanzhong===
In 217, Liu Bei mobilised his forces and personally led a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery from Cao Cao. He ordered Zhang Fei and Ma Chao to supervise Wu Lan (), Lei Tong () and Ren Kui () to attack Wudu Commandery, which was defended by Cao Hong. Zhang Fei attempted to trick Cao Hong into believing that they were planning to seal his retreat route, but Cao Xiu saw through the ruse, and Wu Lan suffered a major defeat which absolved Zhang Fei from continuing the campaign – Lei Tong and Ren Kui were killed in action while Wu Lan fled to Yinping Commandery (陰平郡) and was killed by a Di chieftain, Qiangduan ().

In 219, Liu Bei emerged victorious in the Hanzhong Campaign and proclaimed himself &quot;King of Hanzhong&quot; (). He appointed Zhang Fei as General of the Right (). Liu Bei later planned to return to Chengdu and he wanted to leave a veteran general behind to guard Hanzhong. Many people believed that Zhang Fei would receive this responsibility and even Zhang Fei himself thought so too. However, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, Liu Bei chose Wei Yan instead and appointed him as the Administrator of Hanzhong.

==Service in Shu Han==
In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han. He promoted Zhang Fei to General of Chariots and Cavalry () and Colonel-Director of Retainers (), and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Xi District ().

Liu Bei sent an imperial edict to Zhang Fei as follows: 

===Death===
Earlier in late 219, Sun Quan broke his alliance with Liu Bei and sent his general Lü Meng to lead an invasion of Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province, which resulted in the death of Guan Yu. Around July or August 221, Liu Bei launched a campaign against Sun Quan to take revenge and seize back his territories in Jing Province. Zhang Fei was ordered to lead 10,000 troops from Langzhong to rendezvous with Liu Bei&#x27;s main force at Jiangzhou.

During this mobilisation, Zhang Fei gave a seemingly impossible task to two of his subordinates, Fan Qiang () and Zhang Da (): the two were to design saddles for the horses the Shu army was going to use. Fearing punishment for their failure, the two came up to Zhang Fei and assassinated him. They subsequently decapitated him, defected to Wu, and delivered his head directly to Sun Quan.

When Liu Bei heard that Zhang Fei&#x27;s adjutant had sent him a report, he exclaimed: &quot;Oh! (Zhang) Fei is dead.&quot;

In October or November 260, Liu Bei&#x27;s son and successor Liu Shan granted Zhang Fei the posthumous name &quot;Marquis Huan&quot; ().

==Family and descendants==
In the year 200, Zhang Fei chanced upon Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s niece, Lady Xiahou, while she was out gathering firewood and abducted her. She was around 13 years old at the time by East Asian age reckoning. Zhang Fei knew that she was of good upbringing, so he married her. They had one daughter, who later married Liu Shan and became Empress of the state of Shu. Empress Jing&#x27;ai had a younger sister who also married Liu Shan and was known as Empress Zhang.

Zhang Fei&#x27;s eldest son, Zhang Bao, died at a young age. Zhang Bao&#x27;s son, Zhang Zun (), served as a Master of Writing (). In 263, during the Conquest of Shu by Wei, he followed Zhuge Zhan to defend Mianzhu from the Wei general Deng Ai but was killed in action.

Zhang Fei&#x27;s second son, Zhang Shao (), inherited his father&#x27;s marquis title and served as a Palace Attendant () and Supervisor of the Masters of Writing () in Shu. In 263, the Shu emperor Liu Shan ordered Zhang Shao, Qiao Zhou and Deng Liang () to represent him when he officially surrendered to Deng Ai and brought an end to the Shu regime. After the fall of Shu, Zhang Shao accompanied Liu Shan to the Wei capital Luoyang, where he was enfeoffed as a marquis along with other former Shu officials.

==Appraisal==

Chen Shou, who wrote Zhang Fei&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on the latter as follows: &quot;Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were praised as mighty warriors capable of fighting ten thousand of enemies (萬人敵). They were like tigers among (Liu Bei&#x27;s) subjects. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei both had the style of a &quot;guoshi&quot;. Guan Yu repaid Cao Cao&#x27;s kindness while Zhang Fei released Yan Yan out of righteousness. However, Guan Yu was unrelenting and conceited while Zhang Fei was brutal and heartless. These shortcomings resulted in their downfalls. This was not something uncommon.&quot;

Cheng Yu, an adviser to Cao Cao, once mentioned that Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were &quot;capable of fighting ten thousand of enemies&quot; (萬人敵). This assessment is also that of Guo Jia and Zhou Yu, as did another lesser-known official working for Cao Cao&#x27;s state, Fu Gan (傅幹).

In the main text of Zhang Fei&#x27;s biography, Chen Shou wrote that Zhang Fei respected virtuous persons and detested those of vile character. Liu Bei had constantly warned Zhang Fei about his barbaric behaviour as he once told the latter: &quot;You have dealt out far too excessive punishments. You often flog your men, who are actually the ones who will carry out your orders. Your behaviour will get you into trouble.&quot; Zhang Fei still did not change his ways.

The Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny commented: &quot;There are anecdotes describing Zhang Fei as a man of literary tastes who composed verse in the midst of battle, but he is more generally known as arrogant, impetuous and brutal. While Guan Yu was said to be harsh towards men of the gentry but treated his soldiers well, Zhang Fei was courteous towards the virtuous but cruel to his rank and file. The two men were nonetheless regarded as the finest fighting men of their lifetime.&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Zhang Fei&#x27;s physical appearance was described in the following: eight spans tall (身高八尺), had a head of a panther&#x27;s and huge round eyes (豹頭環眼), a swallow&#x27;s jowls and a tiger&#x27;s beard (燕頷虎鬚)，a voice like thunder and a stance of a dashing horse (聲若巨雷 勢如奔馬). Zhang Fei&#x27;s courtesy name is written as 翼德 in Chinese instead of 益德, but both names have the same pronunciation in Mandarin. Zhang Fei was also described to be an alcoholic, and his obsession with alcohol caused his judgment to be affected from time to time. Throughout the novel, Zhang Fei was depicted as an exceedingly loyal and formidable warrior, but also a short-tempered man, who often got into trouble when he was not on the battlefield. His weapon was a &quot;1.8 &quot;zhang&quot; long refined steel spear&quot; (), which was also called a &quot;1.8 &quot;zhang&quot; long serpent spear&quot; (), meaning &quot;spear as long as a 1.8 zhang serpent&quot; or later &quot;1.8 zhang spear with serpent-shaped head&quot;.

See the following for some fictitious stories in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; involving Zhang Fei:

* Oath of the Peach Garden
* Zhang Fei thrashes the imperial inspector
* Battle of Hulao Pass
* Battle of Changban
* Battle of Jiameng Pass

==In art==
==In popular culture==

Zhang Fei sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, partnered with Guan Yu.

Zhang Fei appears on the Kunqu stage as a &quot;hualian&quot;. In one particular famous scene, &quot;The Swaying Reeds&quot;, Zhang Fei ambushes and humiliates Zhou Yu before setting him free.

Zhang Fakui, a general in the National Revolutionary Army, was nicknamed &quot;Zhang Fei&quot;. In 1959, Peng Dehuai, a marshal of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, identified himself with Zhang Fei. Because Mao Zedong was popularly associated with Cao Cao, Mao and other members of the Chinese Communist Party interpreted Peng&#x27;s identification with Zhang as confrontational, eventually leading to Mao ending Peng&#x27;s career.

Notable actors who have portrayed Zhang Fei in films and television series include: Li Jingfei in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1994); Chen Zhihui in &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot; (2008); Zang Jinsheng in &quot;Red Cliff&quot; (2008–09); Kang Kai in &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; (2010); Justin Cheung in &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; (2019).

Zhang Fei is featured as a playable character in all instalments of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series, as well as &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;, a crossover between &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot;. He also appears in other video games produced by Koei, such as &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Tactics&quot; and &quot;Kessen II&quot;. Other non-Koei titles that he is featured in include &quot;Heroes Evolved&quot;, &quot;Clash of Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Three Kingdoms: Fate of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot; and &quot;Koihime Musō&quot;.

The creative nonfiction travel essay &#x27;Facing Zhang Fei: Hero or Villain or Man&#x27; featured in The Bangalore Review (April 2020). The narrative follows the movements of Australian writer Dean Kerrison in the ancient town Langzhong, Sichuan, which Zhang Fei governed and died in. The piece mixes insights of contemporary Chinese culture, critique relating to Zhang Fei and the Three Kingdoms period, and the theme of heroism including relevant personal anecdotes.

In the collectible card game &quot;&quot;, there is a card named &quot;Zhang Fei, Fierce Warrior&quot; in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set.

The &quot;Pokémon&quot; Emboar was based on Zhang Fei.

<text>The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1917. The history of anime dates back to the early 20th century, with Japan producing its first animated films in the 1910s, influenced by Western animation techniques. However, it was not until the 1960s, with the work of Osamu Tezuka, often called the &quot;God of Manga,&quot; that anime began to take shape as a distinct cultural phenomenon. Tezuka&#x27;s *Astro Boy* (1963) is considered one of the first major anime TV series, setting the foundation for the animation industry. Over the following decades, anime grew in popularity both domestically and internationally, with diverse genres and styles emerging. By the 1980s and 1990s, anime had become a global phenomenon, with influential works such as *Akira*, *Dragon Ball*, and *Sailor Moon* reaching international audiences. Today, anime is a major part of global pop culture, known for its unique art styles, storytelling depth, and expansive influence across media.. Before the advent of film, Japan already had a rich tradition of entertainment with colourful painted figures moving across the projection screen in , a particular Japanese type of magic lantern show popular in the 19th century. Possibly inspired by European phantasmagoria shows, utsushi-e showmen used mechanical slides and developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could each control the motions of different projected figures.

The second generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun&#x27;ichi Kōuchi and Seitarō Kitayama, commonly referred to as the &quot;fathers&quot; of anime. Propaganda films, such as &quot;Momotarō no Umiwashi&quot; (1943) and &quot;&quot; (1945), the latter being the first anime feature film, were made during World War II. 
During the 1970s, anime developed further, with the inspiration of Disney animators, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre. Typical shows from this period include &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Lupin III&quot; and &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;. During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii. Doraemon, which started airing in 1979, has become the longest-running anime of all time.

In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in production with the rise in popularity of anime like &quot;Gundam&quot;, &quot;Macross&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, and genres such as real robot, space opera and cyberpunk. &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; and &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; also achieved worldwide success after being adapted respectively as &quot;Star Blazers&quot; and &quot;Robotech&quot;.

The 1988 film &quot;Akira&quot; went on to become an international success. Later, in 2004, the same creators produced &quot;Steamboy&quot;, which became the most expensive anime film. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; shared the first prize at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival and won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while &quot;Innocence: Ghost in the Shell&quot; was featured at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

== Precursors ==
Before film, Japan had already several forms of entertainment based in storytelling and images. &quot;Emakimono&quot; and &quot;kagee&quot; are considered precursors of Japanese animation. &quot;Emakimono&quot; was common in the eleventh century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the &quot;emakimono&quot; was unrolled from the right to left with chronological order, as a moving panorama. &quot;Kagee&quot; was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows play of China. Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century. The paper play called &quot;Kamishibai&quot; surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s. Puppets of the &quot;bunraku&quot; theater and &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations. Finally, manga were a heavy inspiration for Japanese animation. Cartoonists Kitazawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips in the early 20th century.

==Origins of anime (1900s – 1922)==


According to Natsuki Matsumoto, the first animated film produced in Japan may have stemmed from as early as 1907. Known as , from its depiction of a boy in a sailor suit drawing the characters for &quot;katsudō shashin&quot;, the film was first found in 2005. It consists of fifty frames stencilled directly onto a strip of celluloid. This claim has not been verified though and predates the first known showing of animated films in Japan. The date and first film publicly displayed is another source of contention: while no Japanese-produced animation is definitively known to date before 1916, the possibility exists that other films entered Japan and that no known records have surfaced to prove a showing prior to 1912. Film titles have surfaced over the years, but none have been proven to predate this year. The first foreign animation is known to have been found in Japan in 1910, but it is not clear if the film was ever shown in a cinema or publicly displayed at all. Yasushi Watanabe found a film known as in the records of the company. The description matches James Blackton&#x27;s &quot;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces&quot;, though academic consensus on whether or not this is a true animated film is disputed. According to Kyokko Yoshiyama, the first animated film called was shown in Japan at the in Tokyo sometime in 1912. However, Yoshiyama did not refer to the film as &quot;animation&quot;. The first confirmed animated film shown in Japan was &quot;Les Exploits de Feu Follet&quot; by Émile Cohl on May 15, 1912. While speculation and other &quot;trick films&quot; have been found in Japan, it is the first recorded account of a public showing of a two-dimensional animated film in Japanese cinema. During this time, German animations marketed for home release were distributed in Japan. In 1914, U.S. and European cartoons were introduced to Japan, inspiring Japanese creators like Junichi Kouchi and Seitaro Kitayama, both of whom were considered the &quot;fathers of anime&quot;.

Few complete animations made during the beginnings of Japanese animation have survived. The reasons vary, but many are of commercial nature. After the clips had been run, reels (being property of the cinemas) were sold to smaller cinemas in the country and then disassembled and sold as strips or single frames. The earliest anime that was produced in Japan to have survived into the modern day, &quot;The Dull Sword&quot;, was released on June 30, 1917, but there it is disputed which title was the first to get that honour. It has been confirmed that was made sometime during February 1917. A title by the name of New Art Book of Tokobo: Imosuke&#x27;s Boar Hunt ( 凸坊新畫帖 芋助猪狩の巻) is the first anime domestic film.

The first anime short-films were made by three leading figures in the industry. Ōten Shimokawa was a political caricaturist and cartoonist who worked for the magazine &quot;Tokyo Puck&quot;. He was hired by Tenkatsu to do an animation for them. Due to medical reasons, he was only able to do five movies, including &quot;Imokawa Mukuzo Genkanban no Maki&quot; (1917), before he returned to his previous work as a cartoonist. Another prominent animator in this period was Jun&#x27;ichi Kōuchi. He was a caricaturist and painter, who also had studied watercolour painting. In 1912, he also entered the cartoonist sector and was hired for an animation by Kobayashi Shokai later in 1916. He is viewed as the most technically advanced Japanese animator of the 1910s. His works include around 15 movies. The third was Seitaro Kitayama, an early animator who made animations on his own and was not hired by larger corporations. He eventually founded his own animation studio, the Kitayama Eiga Seisakujo, which was later closed due to lack of commercial success. He used the chalkboard technique, and later paper animation, with and without pre-printed backgrounds. However, the works of these pioneers were destroyed after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. The works of these two latter pioneers include &quot;Namakura Gatana&quot; (&quot;An Obtuse Sword&quot;, 1917) and a 1918 film &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot;, which were believed to have been discovered together at an antique market in 2007. However, it was later established that this &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot; was most likely an entirely different film with a story similar to the missing 1918 film by Kitayama, and therefore is no longer credited to him. As of October 2017, Kitayama&#x27;s &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot; remains undiscovered.

==Pre-war productions (1923–1939)==
Yasuji Murata, Hakuzan Kimura, Sanae Yamamoto and Noburō Ōfuji were students of Kitayama Seitaro and worked at his film studio. Kenzō Masaoka, another important animator, worked at a smaller animation studio. Many early animated Japanese films were lost after the 1923 Tokyo earthquake, including destroying most of the Kitayama studio, with artists trying to incorporate traditional motifs and stories into a new form.

Prewar animators faced several difficulties. First, they had to compete with foreign producers such as Disney, which were influential on both audiences and producers. Foreign films had already made a profit abroad, and could be undersold in the Japanese market, priced lower than what domestic producers needed to break even. Japanese animators thus had to work cheaply, in small companies with only a handful of employees, which then made it difficult to compete in terms of quality with foreign product that was in color, with sound, and promoted by much bigger companies. Until the mid-1930s, Japanese animation generally used cutout animation instead of cel animation because the celluloid was too expensive. This resulted in animation that could seem derivative, flat (since motion forward and backward was difficult) and without detail. But just as postwar Japanese animators were able to turn limited animation into a plus, so masters such as Yasuji Murata and Noburō Ōfuji were able to perform wonders that they made with cutout animation.

Animators such as Kenzo Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, however, did attempt to bring Japanese animation up to the level of foreign work by introducing cel animation, sound, and technology such as the multiplane camera. Masaoka created the first talkie anime, &quot;Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka&quot;, released in 1933, and the first anime made entirely using cel animation, &quot;The Dance of the Chagamas&quot; (1934). Seo was the first to use the multiplane camera in &quot;Ari-chan&quot; in 1941.

Such innovations, however, were difficult to support purely commercially, so prewar animation depended considerably on sponsorship, as animators often concentrated on making PR films for companies, educational films for the government, and eventually works of propaganda for the military. During this time, censorship and school regulations discouraged film-viewing by children, so anime that could possess educational value was supported and encouraged by the Monbusho (the Ministry of Education). This proved important for producers that had experienced obstacles releasing their work in regular theatres. Animation had found a place in scholastic, political, and industrial use.

==During the Second World War==
In the 1930s, the Japanese government began enforcing cultural nationalism. This also lead to strict censorship and control of published media. Many animators were urged to produce animations that enforced the Japanese spirit and national affiliation. Some movies were shown in newsreel theatres, especially after the Film Law of 1939 promoted documentary and other educational films. Such support helped boost the industry, as bigger companies formed through mergers and prompted major live-action studios such as Shochiku to begin producing animation. It was at Shochiku that such masterworks as Kenzō Masaoka&#x27;s &quot;Kumo to Chūrippu&quot; were produced. Wartime reorganization of the industry, however, merged the feature film studios into three big companies.

During the Second World War, more animated films were commissioned by the Imperial Japanese Army, showing the sly, quick Japanese people winning against enemy forces. This included films such as Maysuyo Seo&#x27;s &quot;Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei ()&quot; (1943) which focused on the Japanese occupation of Asia.

==Postwar environment==
In the post-war years, Japanese media was often influenced by the United States, leading some to define anime as any animation emanating from Japan after 1945. In fact, the term itself became more and more common around this time period.

Anime and manga began to flourish in the 1940s and 1950s, with foreign films (and layouts by American cartoonists), influencing people such as Osamu Tezuka.

In the 1950s, anime studios began appearing across Japan. Hiroshi Takahata bought a studio named Japan Animated Films in 1948, renaming it Tōei Dōga, with an ambition to become &quot;the Disney of the East.&quot; While there, Takahata met other animators such as Yasuji Mori, who directed &quot;Doodling Kitty&quot;, in May 1957. However, for the Japanese public, it wasn&#x27;t until the release of &quot;Panda and the Magic Serpent&quot; in October 1958 that Japan fully entered into world of professional animation. While animators began to experiment with their own styles, using Western techniques, Tezuka Osamu began drawing shonen manga like &quot;Rob no Kishi&quot; (Knight of the Ribbon), which later became &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, trying to appeal to female readers, while also pioneering shoujo manga.

==Toei Animation and Mushi Production==

Toei Animation was founded and produced the first color anime feature film in 1958, &quot;Hakujaden&quot; (&quot;The Tale of the White Serpent&quot;, 1958).
It was released in the US in 1961 as well as &quot;Panda and the Magic Serpent&quot;. After the success of the project, Toei released a new feature-length animation annually.

Osamu Tezuka established Mushi Production in 1961, after Tezuka&#x27;s contract with Toei Animation expired. The studio pioneered TV animation in Japan, and was responsible for such successful TV series as &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, &quot;Gokū no Daibōken&quot; and &quot;Princess Knight&quot;.

Mushi Production also produced the first anime to be broadcast in the United States (on NBC in 1963), although Osamu Tezuka would complain about the restrictions on US television, and the alterations necessary for broadcast. The first anime shown in the United States is Animal Baseball Match (動物大野球戦) which was made in 1949 but shown in 1957. 

==1960s==
In the 1960s, the unique style of Japanese anime began forming, with large eyed, big mouthed, and large headed characters. The first anime film to be broadcast was &quot;Moving pictures&quot; in 1960. 1961 saw the premiere of Japan&#x27;s first animated television series, &quot;Instant History&quot;, although it did not consist entirely of animation. 
&quot;Magic Boy&quot;, known in Japan as , is a 1959 Japanese animated feature film released on December 25, 1959. Released as Toei Animation&#x27;s second theatrical anime, the film was released in theaters in United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on June 22, 1961, making it the first anime film to be released in the country, followed by &quot;Panda and the Magic Serpent&quot; on July 8, 1961. These films were popular enough they paved the way for other anime to follow.
Astro Boy, created by Osamu Tezuka, premiered on Fuji TV on January 1, 1963. It became the first anime series shown widely to Western audiences, especially to those in the United States, becoming relatively popular and influencing U.S. popular culture, with American companies acquiring various titles from Japanese producers. &quot;Astro Boy&quot; was highly influential to other anime in the 1960s, and was followed by a large number of anime about robots or space. While Tezuka released many other animated shows, like &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; (based on his own manga), anime took off, studios saw it as a commercial success. The 1960s also brought anime to television and in America. These early agreements made between producers in the U.S. and Japan promised the spread of animation to other places around the globe.

1963 introduced &quot;Sennin Buraku&quot; as the first &quot;late night&quot; anime and Toei Doga&#x27;s first anime television series &quot;Wolf Boy Ken&quot;. Mushi Pro continued to produce more anime television and met success with titles such as &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; in 1965. What is noted as the first magical girl anime, &quot;Sally the Witch&quot;, began broadcasting in 1966. The original &quot;Speed Racer&quot; anime television began in 1967 and was brought to the West with great success. At the same time, an anime adaptation of Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Princess Knight&quot; aired, making it one of very few &quot;shoujo&quot; anime of the decade. The first anime adaptation of Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s manga &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; was created in 1968, following the film adaptation two years prior. 1969&#x27;s &quot;Attack no.1&quot;, the first &quot;shoujo&quot; sports anime was one of the first to have success in Japanese primetime and was also popular throughout Europe, particularly in Germany under the name &quot;Mila Superstar.&quot;

The long-running &quot;Sazae-san&quot; anime also began in 1969 and continues today with excess of 6,500 episodes broadcast as of 2014. With an audience share of 25% the series is still the most-popular anime broadcast.
==1970s==
During the 1970s, the Japanese film market shrank due to competition from television. This reduced Toei animation&#x27;s staff and many animators went to studios such as A Pro and Telecom animation. Mushi Production went bankrupt (though the studio was revived 4 years later), its former employees founding studios such as Madhouse and Sunrise. Many young animators were thrust into the position of director, and the injection of young talent allowed for a wide variety of experimentation. One of the earliest successful television productions in the early 1970s was &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Joe&quot; (1970), a boxing anime which has become iconic in Japan. 1971 saw the first installment of the &quot;Lupin III&quot; anime. Contrary to the franchise&#x27;s current popularity, the first series ran for 23 episodes before being cancelled. The second series (starting in 1977) saw considerably more success, spanning 155 episodes over three years.

Another example of this experimentation is Isao Takahata&#x27;s 1974 television series &quot;Heidi, Girl of the Alps&quot;. This show was originally a hard sell because it was a simple realistic drama aimed at children, and most TV networks thought children needed something more fantastic to draw them in. &quot;Heidi&quot; was an international success, popular in many European countries, and so successful in Japan that it allowed for Hayao Miyazaki and Takahata to start a series of literary-based anime (&quot;World Masterpiece Theater&quot;). Miyazaki and Takahata left Nippon Animation in the late 1970s. Two of Miyazaki&#x27;s critically acclaimed productions during the 1970s were &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; (1978) and &quot;Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; (1979). &quot;Doraemon&quot;, which was broadcast on &quot;TV Asahi&quot; in 1979, has become the most watched and popular anime series of all time.

During this period, Japanese animation reached continental Europe with productions aimed at European and Japanese children, with the most-pronounced examples being the aforementioned &quot;Heidi&quot; but also &quot;Barbapapa&quot; and &quot;Vicky the Viking&quot;. Specifically, anime and manga found receptive audiences in Italy, Germany, and France; East and Southeast Asia; and throughout Latin America. Each country&#x27;s interest increased in Japan&#x27;s output, which was offered for a low price. In the 1970s, censored Japanese animation were shown on U.S. television. For example, transgender characters were censored in &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;, an American adaptation of &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot;.

Another genre known as mecha came into being at this time. Some early works include &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; (1972–1974), &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot; (1972–1974), &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (1974–75) and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (1979–80).

As a contrast to the action-oriented shows, shows for a female audience such as &quot;Candy Candy&quot; and &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; earned high popularity on Japanese television and later in other parts of the world.

By 1978, over fifty shows were aired on television.

==1980s==
In the 1980s, anime started to go through a &quot;visual quality renewal&quot; thanks to new directors like Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, who founded Studio Ghibli in 1985, and Katsuhiro Ōtomo. Anime began to deal with more nuanced and complex stories, while Boy&#x27;s Love continued to impact cultural norms, taking root across East Asia, as countries such as South Korea, Thailand, and China ingested these Japanese pop culture exports. The shift towards space operas became more pronounced with the commercial success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). The science fiction genre, as a whole, had a strong influence on Japanese animation, shaping its creative direction.

This allowed for the space opera &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (1974) to be revived as a theatrical film. &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (1979) was also successful and revived as a theatrical film in 1982. The success of the theatrical versions of &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Gundam&quot; is seen as the beginning of the anime boom of the 1980s, and of &quot;Japanese Cinema&#x27;s Second Golden Age&quot;.

A subculture in Japan, whose members later called themselves &quot;otaku&quot;, began to develop around animation magazines such as &quot;Animage&quot; and &quot;Newtype&quot;. These magazines formed in response to the overwhelming fandom that developed around shows such as &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Gundam&quot; in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In the United States, the popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; had a similar, though much smaller, effect on the development of anime. &quot;Gatchaman&quot; was reworked and edited into &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; in 1978 and again as &quot;G-Force&quot; in 1986. &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; was reworked and edited into &quot;Star Blazers&quot; in 1979. The &quot;Macross&quot; series began with &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; (1982), which was adapted into English as the first arc of &quot;Robotech&quot; (1985), which was created from three separate anime titles: &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, &quot;Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Genesis Climber Mospeada&quot;. The sequel to &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; (1985), became the most successful real robot space opera in Japan, where it managed an average television rating of 6.6% and a peak of 11.7%.

The &quot;otaku&quot; subculture became more pronounced with Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s adaptation of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s popular manga &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; (1981). &quot;Yatsura&quot; made Takahashi a household name and Oshii would break away from fan culture and take a more auteuristic approach with his 1984 film &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot;. This break with the &quot;otaku&quot; subculture would allow Oshii to experiment further.

The &quot;otaku&quot; subculture had some effect on people who were entering the industry around this time. The most famous of these people were the amateur production group Daicon Films which would become Gainax. Gainax began by making films for the Daicon science fiction conventions and were so popular in the &quot;otaku&quot; community that they were given a chance to helm the most expensive anime film at the time, &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise&quot; (1987).

One of the greatest and most influential anime films of all time, &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984), was made during this period. The film gave extra prestige to anime allowing for many experimental and ambitious projects to be funded shortly after its release. It also allowed the film&#x27;s director Hayao Miyazaki and his longtime colleague Isao Takahata to create their own studio under the supervision of former &quot;Animage&quot; editor Toshio Suzuki. This studio would become known as Studio Ghibli and its first film was &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; (1986), one of Miyazaki&#x27;s most-ambitious films.

The success of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; (1986) introduced the martial arts genre and became incredibly influential in the Japanese Animation industry. It influenced many more martial arts anime and manga series&#x27; including &quot;Hajime no Ippo&quot; (1989), &quot;Baki the Grappler&quot; (1991), &quot;Naruto&quot; (2002), and &quot;The God of Highschool&quot; (2020).

The 1980s brought anime to the home video market in the form of original video animation (OVA), as shows were shifting from a focus on superheroes to robots and space operas, with original video animation (OVA or OAV) coming onto the market in 1984, with a range in length. Home videos opened up the floodgates, introducing viewers, especially those in the West, to anime films. Although anime was widely distributed through international piracy in the 1980s and 1990s, before the days of online piracy, it continued to survive. Anime recovered in the U.S., becoming more of Japan&#x27;s television exports as the country became the &quot;world&#x27;s leading authority&quot; in entertainment. The first OVA was Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s &quot;Dallos&quot; (1983–1984). Shows such as &quot;Patlabor&quot; had their beginnings in this market and it proved to be a way to test less-marketable animation against audiences. The OVA allowed for the release of pornographic anime such as &quot;Cream Lemon&quot; (1984); the first &quot;hentai&quot; OVA was actually the little-known Wonder Kids studio&#x27;s &quot;Lolita Anime&quot;, also released in 1984.

The 1980s also saw the amalgamation of anime with video games. The airing of &quot;Red Photon Zillion&quot; (1987) and subsequent release of its companion game, is considered to have been a marketing ploy by Sega to promote sales of their newly released Master System in Japan.

Sports anime, as it is now known, made its debut in 1983 with an anime adaptation of Yoichi Takahashi&#x27;s soccer manga Captain Tsubasa, which became the first worldwide successful sports anime. Its themes and stories were a formula that would be used in many sports series that followed, such as &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, &quot;Prince of Tennis&quot; and &quot;Eyeshield 21&quot;.

The late 1980s saw an increasing number of high-budget and experimental films. In 1985, Toshio Suzuki helped put together funding for Oshii&#x27;s experimental film &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; (1985). Theatrical releases became more ambitious, each film trying to outclass or outspend its predecessors, taking cues from &quot;Nausicaä&quot;″s popular and critical success. &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot; (1985), &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; (1986), and &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (1988) were all ambitious films based on important literary works in Japan. Films such as &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; (1988) and &quot;Arion&quot; (1986) were lavishly budgeted spectacles. This period of lavish budgeting and experimentation would reach its zenith with one of the most-expensive anime film productions ever: &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise&quot; (1987). Studio Ghibli&#x27;s &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; (1989) was the top-grossing film for 1989, earning over $40 million at the box office.

Despite the commercial failure of &quot;Akira&quot; (1988) in Japan, it brought with it a much larger international fan base for anime. When shown overseas, the film became a cult hit and, eventually, a symbol of the medium for the West. The domestic failure and international success of &quot;Akira&quot;, combined with the bursting of the bubble economy and Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s death in 1989, marked the end of the 1980s era of anime.

==1990s==

In 1995, Hideaki Anno wrote and directed the controversial anime &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. This show became popular in Japan among anime fans and became known to the general public through mainstream media attention. It is believed that Anno originally wanted the show to be the ultimate &quot;otaku&quot; anime, designed to revive the declining anime industry, but midway through production he also made it into a heavy critique of the subculture. It culminated in the successful but controversial film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; which grossed over $10 million in 1997. The many violent and sexual scenes in &quot;Evangelion&quot; caused TV Tokyo to increase censorship of anime content. As a result, when &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; was first broadcast in 1998, it was shown heavily edited and only half the episodes were aired; it too gained heavy popularity both in and outside of Japan.

&quot;Evangelion&quot; started a series of so-called &quot;post-&quot;Evangelion&quot;&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; mecha shows. Most of these were giant robot shows with some kind of religious or complex plot. These include &quot;RahXephon&quot;, &quot;Brain Powerd&quot;, and &quot;Gasaraki&quot;. It also led to late-night experimental anime shows which became a forum for experimental anime such as &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; (2000), &quot;Texhnolyze&quot; (2003) and &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot; (2004). Experimental anime films were also released in the 1990s, most notably the cyberpunk thriller &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (1995), which had a strong influence on &quot;The Matrix&quot;. &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, alongside &quot;Evangelion&quot; and the neo-noir space Western &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, helped further increase the awareness of anime in international markets.

In 1997, Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; became the most-expensive anime film up until that time, costing $20 million to produce. Miyazaki personally checked each of the 144,000 cels in the film, and is estimated to have redrawn parts of 80,000 of them. 1997 was also the year of Satoshi Kon&#x27;s debut, &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, which won &quot;Best Film&quot; and &quot;Best Animation&quot; awards at Montreal&#x27;s 1997 Fantasia Festival, It also won awards in Portugal&#x27;s Fantasporto Film Festival.

The late 1990s also saw a brief revival of the super robot genre that had decreased in popularity due to the rise of real robot and psychological mecha shows like &quot;Gundam&quot;, &quot;Macross&quot;, and &quot;Evangelion&quot;. The revival of the super robot genre began with &quot;Brave Exkaiser&quot; in 1990, and led to remakes and sequels of 1970s super robot shows like &quot;Getter Robo Go&quot; and &quot;Tetsujin-28 go FX&quot;. There were very few popular super robot shows produced after this, until &quot;Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann&quot; in 2007.

Alongside its super robot counterpart, the real robot genre was also declining during the 1990s. Though several &quot;Gundam&quot; shows were produced during this decade, very few of them were successful. The only &quot;Gundam&quot; shows in the 1990s which managed an average television rating over 4% in Japan were &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot; (1994) and &quot;New Mobile Report Gundam Wing&quot; (1995). It wasn&#x27;t until &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; in 2002 that the real robot genre regained its popularity.

By 1998, over one hundred anime shows were aired on television in Japan, including a popular series based on the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game franchise. Other 1990s anime series which gained international success were &quot;Dragon Ball Z,&quot; &quot;Sailor Moon,&quot; and &quot;Digimon&quot;; the success of these shows brought international recognition to the martial arts superhero genre, the magical girl genre, and the action-adventure genre, respectively. In particular, &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide. Another large success was the anime &quot;One Piece&quot;, based on the best-selling manga of all time, which is still ongoing.

==2000s==
The &quot;&quot;Evangelion&quot;-era&quot; trend continued into the 2000s with &quot;Evangelion&quot;-inspired mecha anime such as &quot;RahXephon&quot; (2002) and &quot;Zegapain&quot; (2006) – &quot;RahXephon&quot; was also intended to help revive 1970s-style mecha designs. The number of anime productions began to decline after peaking in 2006 due to alternative forms of entertainment, less ad revenue, and other reasons, with TV Tokyo remaining one of the only channels airing anime shows. Even so, anime began entering U.S. homes like never before, with fans able to get their hands on Japanese-language originals of anime they watched, thanks to the internet.

The real robot genre (including the &quot;Gundam&quot; and &quot;Macross&quot; franchises), which had declined during the 1990s, was revived in the early 2000s with the success of shows such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; (2002), &quot;Eureka Seven&quot; (2005), &quot;Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion&quot; (2006), &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot; (2007), and &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; (2008).

The 1970s-style super robot genre revival began with &quot;GaoGaiGar&quot; in 1997 and continued into the 2000s, with several remakes of classic series such as &quot;Getter Robo&quot; and &quot;Dancougar&quot;, as well as original titles created in the super robot mold like &quot;Godannar&quot; and &quot;Gurren Lagann.&quot; &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot; in particular combined the super robot genre with elements from 1980s real robot shows, as well as 1990s &quot;post-&quot;Evangelion&quot;&quot; shows. &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot; received both the &quot;best television production&quot; and &quot;best character design&quot; awards from the Tokyo International Anime Fair in 2008. This eventually culminated in the release of &quot;Shin Mazinger&quot; in 2009, a full-length revival of the first super robot series, &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;.

An art movement started by Takashi Murakami that combined Japanese pop-culture with postmodern art called Superflat began around this time. Murakami asserts that the movement is an analysis of post-war Japanese culture through the eyes of the &quot;otaku&quot; subculture. His desire is also to get rid of the categories of &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27; art making a flat continuum, hence the term &#x27;superflat&#x27;. His art exhibitions have gained popularity overseas and have influenced a handful of anime creators, particularly those from Studio 4 °C.

The experimental late night anime trend popularized by &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; also continued into the 2000s with experimental anime such as &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; (2000), &quot;Texhnolyze&quot; (2003), &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; (2004), &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot; (2004), &quot;Gantz&quot; (2004), and &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot; (2006). Elfen Lied in particular being aired on subsidiary premium network AT-X, allowing director Mamoru Kanbe to push the boundaries of violence, nudity, and story themes, as well as employ unique artistic elements such as artwork inspired by Austrian painter Gustav Klimt.
Before the massive boom from companies like Funimation and Adult Swim, view or even obtaining anime in the United States was quite difficult since the market value and the interest in the states as quite low many broadcasting companies would not bother with airing the shows. This was due to a number of factors one of which was getting the show translated. In the modern we have anime that is dubbed over with English voices making it easier for western audiences. However in the early 90&#x27;s when anime was first stating to become big that was not available. Many fans of the genre would translate the show themselves and would post them online for others to view. This trend would continue until September 2, 2001. This is when the show &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; first aired on the broadcasting network Adult Swim and was the first anime to be broadcast on live television. The show was an instant success, the only problem being the air time was late and at night, meaning that the audience was subject to a small number of people.

In addition to these experimental trends, the 2000s were also characterized by an increase of moe-style art and bishōjo and bishōnen character design. There was a rising presence and popularity of genres such as romance, harem and slice of life.

Anime based on eroge and visual novels increased in popularity in the 2000s, building on a trend started in the late 1990s by such works as &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; (1998) and &quot;To Heart&quot; (1999). Examples of such works include &quot;Green Green&quot; (2003), &quot;SHUFFLE!&quot; (2006), &quot;Kanon&quot; (2002 and 2006), &quot;Fate/Stay Night&quot; (2006), &quot;Higurashi no Naku Koro ni&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;True Tears&quot; (2008), and &quot;Clannad&quot; (2008 and 2009).

Many shows have been adapted from manga and light novels, including popular titles such as &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; (2000), &quot;Inuyasha&quot; (2000), &quot;Naruto&quot; and its sequel series &quot;Naruto Shippuden&quot; (2002 and 2007), &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; and its manga faithful adaptation &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&quot; (2003 and 2009), &quot;Monster&quot; (2004), &quot;Bleach&quot; (2004), &quot;Rozen Maiden&quot; (2005), &quot;Aria the Animation&quot; (2005), &quot;Shakugan no Shana&quot; (2005), &quot;Pani Poni Dash!&quot; (2005), &quot;Death Note&quot; (2006), &quot;Mushishi&quot; (2006), &quot;Sola&quot; (2007), &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; (2006), &quot;Lucky Star&quot; (2007), &quot;Toradora!&quot; (2008), &quot;K-On!&quot; (2009), &quot;Bakemonogatari&quot; (2009), and &quot;Fairy Tail&quot; (2009); these shows typically last several years and achieve large fanbases. Nevertheless, original anime titles continue to be produced with the same success.

The 2000s marked a trend of emphasis of the &quot;otaku&quot; subculture. A notable critique of this &quot;otaku&quot; subculture is found in the 2006 anime &quot;Welcome to the N.H.K.&quot;, which features a &quot;hikikomori&quot; (socially withdrawn) protagonist and explores the effects and consequences of various Japanese sub-cultures, such as &quot;otaku&quot;, lolicon, internet suicide, massively multiplayer online games and multi-level marketing.

In contrast to the above-mentioned phenomenon, there have been more productions of late-night anime for a non-&quot;otaku&quot; audience as well. The first concentrated effort came from Fuji TV&#x27;s Noitamina block. The 30-minute late-Thursday timeframe was created to showcase productions for young women of college age, a demographic that watches very little anime. The first production &quot;Honey and Clover&quot; was a particular success, peaking at a 5% TV rating in Kantou, very strong for late-night anime. The block has been running uninterrupted since April 2005 and has yielded many successful productions unique in the modern anime market.

There have been revivals of American cartoons such as &quot;Transformers&quot; which spawned four new series, &quot;&quot; in 2000, &quot;&quot; in 2003, &quot;&quot; in 2004, and &quot;&quot; in 2005. In addition, an anime adaptation of the G.I Joe series was produced titled &quot;G.I. Joe: Sigma 6&quot;.

The revival of earlier anime series was seen in the forms of &quot;Fist of the North Star: The Legends of the True Savior&quot; (2006) and &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot; (2009). Later series also started receiving revivals in the late 2000s and early 2010s, such as with Studio Khara&#x27;s &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; tetralogy (2007–2021), and new adaptations of Masamune Shirow&#x27;s manga &quot;Appleseed XIII&quot; (2011) and &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Arise&quot; (2013–2016).

The decade also dawned a revival of high-budget feature-length anime films, such as &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; (2001), &quot;Metropolis&quot; (2001), &quot;Appleseed&quot; (2001), &quot;Paprika&quot; (2006), and the most expensive of all being &quot;Steamboy&quot; (2004) which cost $26 million to produce. Satoshi Kon established himself alongside Otomo and Oshii as one of the premier directors of anime film, before his premature death at the age of 46. Other younger film directors, such as Mamoru Hosoda, director of &quot;The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&quot; (2006) and &quot;Summer Wars&quot; (2009), also began to reach prominence.

During this decade, anime feature films were nominated for and won major international film awards for the first time in the industry&#x27;s history. In 2002, &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, a Studio Ghibli production directed by Hayao Miyazaki, won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival and in 2003 at the 75th Academy Awards it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the first non-American film to win the award and is one of only two to do so. It has also become the highest grossing anime film, with a worldwide box office of US$274 million.

Following the launch of the Toonami programming block on Cartoon Network in the United States in March 1997, anime saw a giant rise in the North American market. Kid-friendly anime such as &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, &quot;Digimon&quot;, &quot;Doraemon&quot;, &quot;Bakugan&quot;, &quot;Beyblade&quot;, &quot;Sonic X&quot;, and the 4Kids Entertainment adaptation of &quot;One Piece&quot; have all received varying levels of success. This era also saw the rise of Anime-influenced animation, most notably &quot;&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;, &quot;Megas XLR&quot;, &quot;Code Lyoko&quot;, &quot;Ben 10&quot;, &quot;Chaotic&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, &quot;RWBY&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans&quot;.
As such, anime further became entrenched in U.S. households with the launch of Adult Swim by Cartoon Network in 2001, aimed at those in the &quot;older OVA &amp; tape trading crowd,&quot; with a new fandom forming. This fandom was, however, exclusive and elitist with newcomers expected to know how to use IRC, some basic Japanese, and so on.

At the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot;, directed by Mamoru Oshii, was in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or and in 2006, at the 78th Academy Awards, &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;, another Studio Ghibli-produced film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, was nominated for Best Animated Feature. &quot;5 Centimeters per Second&quot;, directed by Makoto Shinkai, won the inaugural Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2007, and so far, anime films have been nominated for the award every year.

By 2004, over two hundred shows were aired on television.

In 2006, graduates of the University of California, Berkeley launched Crunchyroll in 2006, becoming the first &quot;anime streaming service&quot;, a model later used by Netflix, Funimation, and Amazon.com in the later 2010s.

==2010s==
In May 2012, the Toonami programming block in the United States was relaunched as a late night adult-oriented action block on Adult Swim, bringing more uncut popular anime back to a wider audience on cable television. In addition to broadcasting or re-broadcasting previously released dubbed anime, the block (as well as Adult Swim itself) has overseen the worldwide premiere of English dubbed releases for various anime, including but not limited to: &quot;Durarara!!&quot; (2010), &quot;Deadman Wonderland&quot; (2011), &quot;Hunter x Hunter&quot; (2011), &quot;Sword Art Online&quot; (2012), &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; (2012), &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; (2013), &quot;Kill la Kill&quot; (2013), &quot;Space Dandy&quot; (2014), &quot;Akame ga Kill!&quot; (2014), &quot;Parasyte -the maxim-&quot; (2014), &quot;One-Punch Man&quot; (2015), &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; (2015), &quot;My Hero Academia&quot; (2016), &quot;&quot; (2017), and &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot; (2019).

On September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki announced that &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; (2013) would be his last film, and on August 3, 2014, it was announced that Studio Ghibli was &quot;temporarily halting production&quot; following the release of &quot;When Marnie Was There&quot; (2014), further substantiating the finality of Miyazaki&#x27;s retirement. The disappointing sales of Isao Takahata&#x27;s comeback film &quot;The Tale of Princess Kaguya&quot; (2013) has also been cited as a factor. Several prominent staffers, including producer Yoshiaki Nishimura and director Hiromasa Yonebayashi, left to form their own Studio Ponoc, premièring with &quot;Mary and the Witch&#x27;s Flower&quot; (2017). Both Ghibli and Miyazaki subsequently went back into production for the 2023 film &quot;The Boy and the Heron&quot;, while Takahata died on April 5, 2018, of lung cancer.

Various international anime distribution companies, such as ADV Films, Bandai Entertainment, and Geneon Entertainment, were shut down due to poor revenue, with their assets spun into new companies like Sentai Filmworks or given to other companies.

In 2011, &quot;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&quot; was aired in Japan. The anime was a change from normal magical girl anime, as this anime contained more darker, complex and gorier themes than magical anime usually would. The anime got great reception from critics, as &quot;United Kingdom&#x27;s Anime Network&#x27;s&quot; Andy Hanley rated it a 10 out of 10 for its emotional content and evocative soundtrack.

Both &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; and &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; reflect a national debate surrounding the reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, with Miyazaki&#x27;s pacifism in the film coming under fire from the political right, while &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; has been accused of promoting militarism by people in neighboring Asian countries, despite being intended to show the haunting, hopeless aspects of conflict. The mecha anime genre (as well as Japanese kaiju films) received a Western homage with the 2013 film &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; directed by Guillermo del Toro.

Western streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have become increasingly involved in the production and licensing of anime for the international markets.

In 2015, an all-record-high of three hundred forty anime series aired on television.

==2020s==
The global popularity and demand of anime continued to rise during the decade due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the medium&#x27;s wide availability on streaming services.

&quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train&quot; became the highest-grossing Japanese film and the world&#x27;s highest-grossing film of 2020. It also became the fastest grossing film in Japanese cinema, because in 10 days it made 10 billion yen ($95.3m; £72m). It beat the previous record of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; which took 25 days.

In 2021, the anime adaptations of &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot;, &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Revengers&quot; were among the top 10 most discussed TV shows worldwide on X (then known as Twitter).

In 2022, &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; won the award of &quot;Most In-Demand TV Series in the World 2021&quot; in the Global TV Demand Awards. Attack on Titan became the first ever non-English language series to earn the title of World&#x27;s Most In-Demand TV Show, previously held by only &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.
Also on 2022, Is the populair Kids Anime show Ninjala who gained its new kodomo show after Youkai Watch who is still populair in the 2020 era.

In 2023, the opening theme &quot;Idol&quot; by YOASOBI of the anime series &quot;Oshi no Ko&quot; topped the Billboard Global 200 Excl. U.S. charts with 45.7 million streams and 24,000 copies sold outside the U.S. &quot;Idol&quot; has become the first Japanese song and anime song to top the Billboard Global chart as well as taking the first spot on the Apple Music&#x27;s Top 100: Global chart.

In 2024, Studio Ghibli&#x27;s The Boy and the Heron was given the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, making it the second oscar award won by Hayao Miyazaki. It became the second non-English language film to win the award after &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.

<text>A prisoner of conscience (POC) is anyone imprisoned because of their race, sexual orientation, religion, or political views. The term also refers to those who have been imprisoned or persecuted for the nonviolent expression of their conscientiously held beliefs.

Most often associated with the human rights organisation Amnesty International, the term was coined by that organisation&#x27;s founder Peter Benenson in a 28 May 1961 article (&quot;The Forgotten Prisoners&quot;) for London newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;.

==Definition==
The article &quot;The Forgotten Prisoners&quot; by English lawyer Peter Benenson, published in &quot;The Observer&quot; on 28 May 1961, launched the campaign &quot;Appeal for Amnesty 1961&quot; and first defined a &quot;prisoner of conscience&quot;.

The primary goal of this year-long campaign, founded by Benenson and a small group of writers, academics and lawyers, including Quaker peace activist Eric Baker, was to identify individual prisoners of conscience around the world and then campaign for their release. In early 1962, the campaign had received enough public support to become a permanent organization and was renamed Amnesty International.

In 1995, Amnesty International changed Benenson&#x27;s original definition to include people &quot;deprived of their liberty... for discriminatory reasons relating to their ethnicity, sexuality, gender, or other identity&quot;, and to exclude people who have &quot;advocated hatred&quot;. This caused Alexei Navalny&#x27;s status as a POC to be rescinded in February 2021 due to comments he made on migrants in 2007 and 2008 which Amnesty International regarded as &quot;hate speech&quot;.

Amnesty International announced &quot;a review of its overall approach to the use of the term &#x27;Prisoner of Conscience&#x27;&quot;, following the controversy surrounding the use of the term to describe Alexei Navalny, stating, &quot;[a]s an initial interim step, our approach has been refined to not exclude a person from designation as a Prisoner of Conscience solely based on their conduct in the past&quot;, and that Navalny has been &quot;re-designate[d]&quot; as a Prisoner of Conscience.

Under British law, Amnesty International was classed as a political organisation and therefore excluded from tax-free charity status. To work around this, the &quot;Fund for the Persecuted&quot; was established in 1962 to receive donations to support prisoners and their families. The name was later changed to the &quot;Prisoners of Conscience Appeal Fund&quot; and is now a separate and independent charity which provides relief and rehabilitation grants to prisoners of conscience in the UK and around the world.

Amnesty International has, since its founding, pressured governments to release those persons it considers to be prisoners of conscience. Governments, conversely, tend to deny that the specific prisoners identified by Amnesty International are, in fact, being held on the grounds Amnesty claims; they allege that these prisoners pose genuine threats to the security of their countries.

The concept of &quot;prisoners of conscience&quot; became a controversy around Nelson Mandela&#x27;s imprisonment in South Africa 1964. He had initially been adopted as a prisoner of conscience in 1962, when he was sentenced to five years in jail for inciting a strike of African workers. This was reversed after the Rivonia Trial showed that Mandela now had turned to violently opposing the South African regime. The reversal evolved in 1964 into a worldwide debate and a poll among the members of Amnesty International. The overwhelming majority decided to maintain the basic rule, that prisoners of conscience are those who have not used or advocated violence.

The phrase is now widely used in political discussions to describe a political prisoner, whether or not Amnesty International has specifically adopted the case, although the phrase has a different scope and definition than that of political prisoner.

<text>Holland America Line N.V. (HAL) is an American-owned cruise line, a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States.

Holland America Line was founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands. From 1873 to 1989, it operated as a Dutch shipping line, a passenger line, a cargo line and a cruise line operating primarily between the Netherlands and North America. As part of the company&#x27;s legacy, it was directly involved in the transport of many hundreds of thousands of emigrants from the Netherlands to North America.

Holland America has been a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation since 1989.

==History==
===Early decades===

Holland America Line was founded in 1873, as the Nederlandsch-Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij (Dutch-American Steamship Company), in short Holland-Amerika Lijn, a shipping and passenger line. It was headquartered in Rotterdam, in the building which is now the Hotel New York. The company was formed as a result of the reorganization of an earlier company, Plate, Reuchlin &amp; Co. The company&#x27;s first ship was the original , which sailed its 15-day maiden voyage from the Netherlands to New York City on October 15, 1872. Cargo service to New York started in 1909.

HAL&#x27;s main route was between Rotterdam and New York. Its &quot;New York&quot; terminal was in fact in Hoboken, New Jersey, on the opposite side of the Hudson River from New York City. By 1892, HAL ships sailing between Rotterdam and Hoboken were scheduled to call en route at Boulogne in France.

In its first 25 years, the company carried 400,000 people from Europe to the Americas. Other North American ports were added during the early 20th century.

===Larger ships===

Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast launched the third &quot;Rotterdam&quot; (1897). She was the first HAL ship built by H&amp;W. H&amp;W next launched : the first HAL ship of that name, and the first HAL ship of more than . In 1899 Blohm+Voss in Hamburg launched , which was long and . H&amp;W built two sister ships for &quot;Potsdam&quot;: (1901) and .

In 1902 William Pirrie, Chairman of H&amp;W, negotiated to buy 51 percent of HAL&#x27;s share capital. Pirrie was acting on behalf of J. P. Morgan&#x27;s International Mercantile Marine Company (IMM), which already owned HAL&#x27;s Belgian competitor Red Star Line. Pirrie did not disclose the fact that IMM had formed a cartel with Albert Ballin&#x27;s Hamburg America Line (HAPAG) and Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL), and wanted to buy HAL to control passenger and cargo rates across the North Atlantic.

HAL continued to order ever larger ships from H&amp;W. was long and . The fourth was long and .

In 1895 HAL offered its first cruise. Its second cruise, from New York to Palestine, was offered in 1910.

===First World War===
In July 1914 H&amp;W launched a new &quot;Statendam&quot; that was and . However, a month later, the First World War started, and in 1915 the UK government requisitioned the new ship in H&amp;W&#x27;s shipyard and had her completed as the troopship . A U-boat sank her in 1918, and HAL accepted the UK government&#x27;s offer of 60,000 tons of steel as compensation.
In the First World War the Netherlands were neutral, but numerous Dutch merchant ships were sunk. HAL lost five cargo ships, totalling more than . In 1915 two German mines sank &quot;Eemdijk&quot;, and in 1916 stopped and sank . On 22 February 1917 sank an entire Dutch convoy, including the HAL ships &quot;Noorderdijk&quot; and &quot;Zaandijk&quot;.

After the First World War began, Dutch capitalists bought HAPAG and NDL&#x27;s shares in HAL. In December 1917, the same Dutch interests paid $3.5 million for half of IMM&#x27;s shares in HAL. This amounted to about $800 per share, which was far more than IMM had paid for them in 1902. In 1916, IMM had received a dividend of 50 percent on its HAL shareholding.

In March 1918 President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation seizing under angary 89 Dutch merchant ships in US ports. They included the HAL liner &quot;Rijndam&quot;, which was converted into a US troopship, and eight HAL cargo ships. One of these, , was sunk in a collision while being used by the United States Navy. The United States Shipping Board returned &quot;Rijndam&quot; and the surviving cargo ships to HAL in the course of 1919.

===Between the World Wars===

In 1921–22 HAL introduced its first steam turbine passenger liners: the , &quot;Edam&quot;, &quot;Leerdam&quot; and &quot;Spaarndam&quot;. They served a route between Rotterdam and Tampico in Mexico. On westbound voyages, their ports of call were Antwerp, Boulogne, Bilbao, Santander, Gijón, A Coruña, Vigo, Havana and Vera Cruz. On eastbound voyages, they called at Vera Cruz, New Orleans, Havana, A Coruña and Santander.

In 1922 H&amp;W launched two larger passenger liners for HAL&#x27;s Rotterdam – Hoboken route: the and . By 1925 the Rotterdam – Hoboken route included calls at Southampton and Halifax, Nova Scotia on westbound crossings only, and Plymouth, Devon on eastbound crossings only, as well as serving Boulogne in both directions.
The third , built to replace &quot;Justicia&quot;, was also a turbine steamship, but building her took eight years. H&amp;W laid her down in 1921 and launched her in 1924, but then stopped work because HAL lacked the funds to pay for her to be completed. In 1927 the Dutch government gave HAL a loan to get the ship towed to the Netherlands and completed at Wilton&#x27;s Dok- en Werf Maatschappij in Schiedam. She was completed in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression, but proved economical to run. She was HAL&#x27;s flagship on the transatlantic run for most of the 1930s. &quot;Statendam&quot; also gave annual winter cruises from New York, usually to the Caribbean.

In 1920 van der Giessen &amp; Zonen in Krimpen aan den IJssel launched &quot;Burgerdijk&quot;, which was HAL&#x27;s first steam turbine cargo ship. She was the first of eight sister ships, all with a name beginning with &quot;B&quot;, built between 1920 and 1922. In 1922 and 1923 Scheepsbouw-Maatschappij &#x27;Nieuwe Waterweg&#x27; in Scheidam launched a pair of larger turbine cargo ships for HAL, the &quot;Gaasterdijk&quot; and &quot;Grootendijk&quot;. However, HAL sold both ships in 1931.

In 1921 and 1922 H&amp;W launched the &quot;Dinteldijk&quot; and &quot;Drechtdijk&quot;, which were HAL&#x27;s first motor ships. They were refrigerated cargo ships, and they also had berths for 18 or 19 first class passengers. In 1929 and 1930 Wilton&#x27;s in Schiedam launched two more motor ships for refrigerated cargo, the &quot;Delftdijk&quot; and &quot;Damsterdijk&quot;. These were cargo liners, with berths for 50 first class passengers.
By 1930 HAL was operating routes between Rotterdam and the British Columbia Coast via London, Panama Canal and West Coast of the United States. By 1937 HAL worked these routes jointly with Royal Mail Lines. This was mainly a refrigerated cargo service, but the ships carried some passengers. &quot;Damsterdijk&quot;, &quot;Delftdijk&quot;, &quot;Dinteldijk&quot; and &quot;Drechtdijk&quot; shared the route with RML&#x27;s refrigerated cargo ships &quot;Lochmonar&quot;, &quot;Lochkatrine&quot; and &quot;Lochgoil&quot;. As well as London, they were scheduled to call at various other ports in Britain, the Caribbean, California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, terminating at Vancouver. On westbound voyages &quot;Damsterdijk&quot;, &quot;Delftdijk&quot; and &quot;Lochmonar&quot; also served Guayaquil in Ecuador, whereas &quot;Dinteldijk&quot;, &quot;Drechtdijk&quot;, &quot;Lochkatrine&quot; and &quot;Lochgoil&quot; served Bermuda.

A new HAL flagship, the , was launched in 1937 and entered service in 1938. In 1939 HAL bought the former Red Star liners and , a pair of sister ships that Nazi Germany had forced the Jewish shipping magnate Arnold Bernstein to forfeit.

===Second World War===

In the Second World War, HAL lost five passenger ships and eight cargo ships: a total of more than . Three were while the Netherlands were still neutral. Mines sank &quot;Binnendijk&quot; and &quot;Spaarndam&quot; in October and November 1939, and sank &quot;Burgerdijk&quot; in February 1940.

On 10 May Germany invaded the Netherlands. A number of HAL ships were burnt out in the battle for Rotterdam, including the liner &quot;Statendam&quot; and cargo ships &quot;Boschdijk&quot; and &quot;Dinteldijk&quot;. &quot;Statendam&quot; was scrapped three months later. German forces towed &quot;Boschdijk&quot; to the Baltic, where the Luftwaffe used her for target practice until she sank in April 1942. German forces scuttled &quot;Dinteldijk&quot; as a blockship in 1944.

By 27 May, Germany had occupied the whole of the Netherlands. By 7 June, the Dutch government-in-exile and the UK government had formed a British-Netherlands shipping committee in London, and NASM announced that it would charter to the UK government all of its transatlantic ships except &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;. &quot;Pennland&quot; became a troop ship. The Dutch government-in-exile requisitioned &quot;Westernland&quot;, berthed at Falmouth, Cornwall. She became an accommodation ship for the Royal Netherlands Navy, and was later sold to the UK Admiralty. By October 1940 &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot; had also become an Allied troop ship. She sailed half a million miles and carried 400,000 military personnel.
Nearly 200 people were killed in wartime sinkings of HAL ships. The biggest loss of life was in November 1942, when sank the cargo-passenger ship . 135 of her passengers and crew were killed. 39 people were killed in January 1941, when a mine sank the cargo ship .

In October 1940 sank &quot;Bilderdijk&quot;. In 1941 sank the cargo-passenger liner &quot;Maasdam&quot;, and an air attack in German invasion of Greece sank the troopship &quot;Pennland&quot;. In September 1942, sank &quot;Breedijk&quot;. In 1940 German forces requisitioned &quot;Drechtdijk&quot;. In 1945 she hit a mine in the Baltic, and a week later was badly damaged in an air raid.

===Post-war era===

After the war, HAL took part in transporting a great wave of immigrants from the Netherlands to Canada and elsewhere. Its Rotterdam – Hoboken route continued to serve Southampton, but by 1948 the port of Boulogne was still not in a condition to resume handling large ocean liners. Instead, from February 1948 &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot; started calling at Le Havre as well as Southampton. At first she was the only HAL ship to do so. &quot;Veendam&quot; made intermediate calls at Southampton only, and &quot;Noordam&quot; and &quot;Westerdam&quot; ran direct between Rotterdam and Hoboken. By 1959 HAL ships were calling also at Cobh, and running a service to Quebec and Montreal. By 1963 they also served Bremerhaven.

A notable ship in the post-war era was the fifth , launched in 1959. She was one of the first North Atlantic ships equipped for two-class transatlantic crossing and one-class luxury cruising.

By the late 1960s, the golden era of transatlantic passenger ships had been ended by the introduction of transatlantic jet air travel. HAL ended transatlantic service in the early 1970s.

In 1973, it sold its cargo shipping division, which continued to operate freight liner services with cargo ships, a Lighter aboard ship (&#x27;LASH&#x27; ship, MV &quot;Bilderdyk&quot;) and then container ships under the trade name Incotrans, with headquarters in Rotterdam, with some of its North American services operated in partnership with the French shipping line Compagnie Générale Maritime.

HAL ceased operating as a Dutch line in 1989, when Carnival bought it for 1.2 billion guilders (€530 million). The proceeds were put into an investment company (HAL Investments), the majority of which is owned by the van der Vorm family.

===US-based cruise line (1989–present)===

In 1989, the Holland America Line was bought by Carnival Corp, thus becoming a US–owned cruise line headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States.

In the summer of 2011, did two transatlantic crossings, the first traditional transatlantic runs made by the line in more than 40 years.

Beginning in September 2012, &quot;Rotterdam&quot; was based year-round out of Rotterdam, sailing to Europe, the Caribbean, as well as Asia, before returning to more varied itineraries and home ports by 2016.

 makes annual &quot;Grand Voyages&quot; lasting more than 60 days, including a grand circle of the Pacific Ocean each fall and a World Voyage sailing around the world, usually ranging from January to April/May.

The line currently operates four different classes of ship: the R class, the , the , and the newest and largest Pinnacle class.

All HAL ships have a dark blue hull with white superstructure, with the company&#x27;s logo featured prominently on the functional smoke stacks.

Holland America also owns the following:
* the Westmark hotel chain operating in Alaska and the Yukon
* Half Moon Cay, a private Caribbean island (known officially as Little San Salvador Island) with most Caribbean cruises spending a day there.

On October 26, 2012, it was announced that a memorandum of agreement had been signed with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri for the construction of a 2,660-passenger ship for Holland America Line scheduled for delivery in spring 2016. &quot;Koningsdam&quot;, which became a new class of ship for the line (The Pinnacle Class), and the first new Holland America ship since , delivered in 2010. Also noted was that the addition of new ships would maintain passenger capacity if some of the older Carnival Corporation ships are sold.

The Holland America Group of HAL and Princess Cruises have a letter of understanding to buy the White Pass and Yukon Route between Skagway, Alaska and the US-Canadian border. The purchase closed July 31, 2018.

On July 15, 2020, it was announced by Holland America that , , &quot;Rotterdam&quot;, and &quot;Amsterdam&quot; were sold to two undisclosed buyers. The ships were sold in pairs, with the &quot;Maasdam&quot; and &quot;Veendam&quot; transferring to one company in August 2020, while the &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;Rotterdam&quot; moved to another company in fall 2020. One pair went to a new cruise brand and the other to an existing brand.

Most cruise lines suspended their sailings because of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. As of January 6, 2021, all Holland America sailings were cancelled to at least April 30, 2021, according to an industry news item. That report listed no specific sailings for Holland America prior to the first week of June 2021.

In October 2023, Holland America announced that it was about halfway through converting its fleet Wi-Fi to Starlink. The cruise line also announced that it expected to have Starlink fully operational across its entire fleet by mid-December 2023. With the move, Holland America joined its sister-brands in Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, including Princess Cruises and Cunard Line.

<doc id="319610" wikidata="Q513359" url="?curid=319610" title="Biological life cycle">
<text>In biology, a biological life cycle (or just life cycle when the biological context is clear) is a series of stages of the life of an organism, that begins as a zygote, often in an egg, and concludes as an adult that reproduces, producing an offspring in the form of a new zygote which then itself goes through the same series of stages, the process repeating in a cyclic fashion.

&quot;The concept is closely related to those of the life history, development and ontogeny, but differs from them in stressing renewal.&quot; Transitions of form may involve growth, asexual reproduction, or sexual reproduction.

In some organisms, different &quot;generations&quot; of the species succeed each other during the life cycle. For plants and many algae, there are two multicellular stages, and the life cycle is referred to as alternation of generations. The term life history is often used, particularly for organisms such as the red algae which have three multicellular stages (or more), rather than two.

Life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating haploid (&quot;n&quot;) and diploid (2&quot;n&quot;) stages, i.e., a change of ploidy is involved. To return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage, meiosis must occur. In regard to changes of ploidy, there are three types of cycles:
*&quot;haplontic&quot; life cycle — the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell, meiosis is &quot;zygotic&quot;.
*&quot;diplontic&quot; life cycle — the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid gametes are formed, meiosis is &quot;gametic&quot;.
*&quot;haplodiplontic&quot; life cycle (also referred to as &quot;diplohaplontic&quot;, &quot;diplobiontic&quot;, or &quot;dibiontic&quot; life cycle) — multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur, meiosis is &quot;sporic&quot;.

The cycles differ in when mitosis (growth) occurs. Zygotic meiosis and gametic meiosis have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the &quot;n&quot; phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2&quot;n&quot; phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore, zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed &quot;haplobiontic&quot; (single mitotic phase, not to be confused with haplontic). Sporic meiosis, on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed &quot;diplobiontic&quot; (not to be confused with diplontic).

==Discovery==
The study of reproduction and development in organisms was carried out by many botanists and zoologists.

Wilhelm Hofmeister demonstrated that alternation of generations is a feature that unites plants, and published this result in 1851 (see plant sexuality).

Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius, and then became used for other organisms. Other terms (autogamy and gamontogamy) used in protist life cycles were introduced by Karl Gottlieb Grell. The description of the complex life cycles of various organisms contributed to the disproof of the ideas of spontaneous generation in the 1840s and 1850s.

A zygotic meiosis is a meiosis of a zygote immediately after karyogamy, which is the fusion of two cell nuclei. This way, the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several haploid cells. These cells divide mitotically to form either larger, multicellular individuals, or more haploid cells. Two opposite types of gametes (e.g., male and female) from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote.

In the whole cycle, zygotes are the only diploid cell; mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase.

The individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are haplonts, hence this life cycle is also called haplontic life cycle. Haplonts are:

* In archaeplastidans: some green algae (e.g., &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot;, &quot;Zygnema&quot;, &quot;Chara&quot;)
* In stramenopiles: some golden algae
* In alveolates: many dinoflagellates, e.g., Ceratium, Gymnodinium, some apicomplexans (e.g., &quot;Plasmodium&quot;)
* In rhizarians: some euglyphids, ascetosporeans
* In excavates: some parabasalids
* In amoebozoans: &quot;Dictyostelium&quot;
* In opisthokonts: most fungi (some chytrids, zygomycetes, some ascomycetes, basidiomycetes)

==Diplontic life cycle==
In gametic meiosis, instead of immediately dividing &quot;meiotically&quot; to produce haploid cells, the zygote divides &quot;mitotically&quot; to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or gametes. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells, as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.

In the whole cycle, gametes are usually the only haploid cells, and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.

The diploid multicellular individual is a diplont, hence a gametic meiosis is also called a diplontic life cycle. Diplonts are:

* In archaeplastidans: some green algae (e.g., &quot;Cladophora glomerata&quot;, &quot;Acetabularia&quot;)
* In stramenopiles: some brown algae (the Fucales, however, their life cycle can also be interpreted as strongly heteromorphic-diplohaplontic, with a highly reduced gametophyte phase, as in the flowering plants), some xanthophytes (e.g., &quot;Vaucheria&quot;), most diatoms, some oomycetes (e.g., &quot;Saprolegnia&quot;, &quot;Plasmopara viticola&quot;), opalines, some &quot;heliozoans&quot; (e.g., &quot;Actinophrys&quot;, &quot;Actinosphaerium&quot;)
* In alveolates: ciliates 
* In excavates: some parabasalids
* In opisthokonts: animals, some fungi (e.g., some ascomycetes)

==Haplodiplontic life cycle==
In sporic meiosis (also commonly known as intermediary meiosis), the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which &quot;also&quot; then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called gametophytes. The gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis. In some plants the gametophyte is not only small-sized but also short-lived; in other plants and many algae, the gametophyte is the &quot;dominant&quot; stage of the life cycle.

Haplodiplonts are:

* In archaeplastidans: red algae (which have two sporophyte generations), some green algae (e.g., &quot;Ulva&quot;), land plants
* In stramenopiles: most brown algae
* In rhizarians: many foraminiferans, plasmodiophoromycetes
* In amoebozoa: myxogastrids
* In opisthokonts: some fungi (some chytrids, some ascomycetes like the brewer&#x27;s yeast)
* Other eukaryotes: haptophytes

Some animals have a sex-determination system called haplodiploid, but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle.

== Vegetative meiosis ==
Some red algae (such as &quot;Bonnemaisonia&quot; and &quot;Lemanea&quot;) and green algae (such as &quot;Prasiola&quot;) have vegetative meiosis, also called somatic meiosis, which is a rare phenomenon. Vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles. The gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte. Vegetative (non-reproductive) diploid cells undergo meiosis, generating vegetative haploid cells. These undergo many mitosis, and produces gametes.

A different phenomenon, called vegetative diploidization, a type of apomixis, occurs in some brown algae (e.g., &quot;Elachista stellaris&quot;). Cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue.

==Parasitic life cycle==

Parasites depend on the exploitation of one or more hosts. Those that must infect more than one host species to complete their life cycles are said to have complex or indirect life cycles. &quot;Dirofilaria immitis,&quot; or the heartworm, has an indirect life cycle, for example. The microfilariae must first be ingested by a female mosquito, where it develops into the infective larval stage. The mosquito then bites an animal and transmits the infective larvae into the animal, where they migrate to the pulmonary artery and mature into adults. 

Those parasites that infect a single species have direct life cycles. An example of a parasite with a direct life cycle is &quot;Ancylostoma caninum&quot;, or the canine hookworm. They develop to the infective larval stage in the environment, then penetrate the skin of the dog directly and mature to adults in the small intestine.

If a parasite has to infect a given host in order to complete its life cycle, then it is said to be an obligate parasite of that host; sometimes, infection is facultative—the parasite can survive and complete its life cycle without infecting that particular host species. Parasites sometimes infect hosts in which they cannot complete their life cycles; these are accidental hosts.

A host in which parasites reproduce sexually is known as the definitive, final or primary host. In intermediate hosts, parasites either do not reproduce or do so asexually, but the parasite always develops to a new stage in this type of host. In some cases a parasite will infect a host, but not undergo any development, these hosts are known as paratenic or transport hosts. The paratenic host can be useful in raising the chance that the parasite will be transmitted to the definitive host. For example, the cat lungworm (&quot;Aelurostrongylus abstrusus&quot;) uses a slug or snail as an intermediate host; the first stage larva enters the mollusk and develops to the third stage larva, which is infectious to the definitive host—the cat. If a mouse eats the slug, the third stage larva will enter the mouse&#x27;s tissues, but will not undergo any development.
==Evolution==
The primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction. Bacteria and archaea exhibit a life cycle like this, and some eukaryotes apparently do too (e.g., Cryptophyta, Choanoflagellata, many Euglenozoa, many Amoebozoa, some red algae, some green algae, the imperfect fungi, some rotifers and many other groups, not necessarily haploid). However, these eukaryotes probably are not primitively asexual, but have lost their sexual reproduction, or it just was not observed yet. Many eukaryotes (including animals and plants) exhibit asexual reproduction, which may be facultative or obligate in the life cycle, with sexual reproduction occurring more or less frequently.

Individual organisms participating in a biological life cycle ordinarily age and die, while cells from these organisms that connect successive life cycle generations (germ line cells and their descendants) are potentially immortal. The basis for this difference is a fundamental problem in biology. The Russian biologist and historian Zhores A. Medvedev considered that the accuracy of genome replicative and other synthetic systems alone cannot explain the immortality of germlines. Rather Medvedev thought that known features of the biochemistry and genetics of sexual reproduction indicate the presence of unique information maintenance and restoration processes at the gametogenesis stage of the biological life cycle. In particular, Medvedev considered that the most important opportunities for information maintenance of germ cells are created by recombination during meiosis and DNA repair; he saw these as processes within the germ line cells that were capable of restoring the integrity of DNA and chromosomes from the types of damage that cause irreversible ageing in non-germ line cells, e.g. somatic cells.

The ancestry of each present day cell presumably traces back, in an unbroken lineage for over 3 billion years to the origin of life. It is not actually cells that are immortal but multi-generational cell lineages. The immortality of a cell lineage depends on the maintenance of cell division potential. This potential may be lost in any particular lineage because of cell damage, terminal differentiation as occurs in nerve cells, or programmed cell death (apoptosis) during development. Maintenance of cell division potential of the biological life cycle over successive generations depends on the avoidance and the accurate repair of cellular damage, particularly DNA damage. In sexual organisms, continuity of the germline over successive cell cycle generations depends on the effectiveness of processes for avoiding DNA damage and repairing those DNA damages that do occur. Sexual processes in eukaryotes provide an opportunity for effective repair of DNA damages in the germ line by homologous recombination.

<text>Life history is an interviewing method used to record autobiographical history from an ordinary person&#x27;s perspective, often gathered from traditionally marginalized groups. It was begun by anthropologists studying Native American groups around the 1900s, and was taken up by sociologists and other scholars, though its popularity has waxed and waned since. One of the major strengths of the life history method is that it provides a kind of voice from a social milieu that is often overlooked or indeed invisible in intellectual discourse.

==Life history method==

The method was first used when interviewing indigenous peoples of the Americas and specifically Native American leaders who were asked by an interviewer to describe their lives with an insight as to what it was like to be that particular person. The purpose of the interview was to capture a living picture of a disappearing (as such) people/way of life.

Later the method was used to interview criminals and prostitutes in Chicago. Interviewers looked at social and police-records, as well as the society in general, and asked subjects to talk about their lives. The resulting report discussed (i) Chicago at that particular time; (ii) how the subject viewed their own life (i.e. &#x27;how it was like to be this particular person&#x27;) and (iii) how society viewed the subject and whether they would be incarcerated, receive help, perform social work, etc.
The landmark of the life history method was developed in the 1920s and most significantly embodied in &quot;The Polish Peasant in Europe and America&quot; by W. I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki. The authors employed a Polish immigrant to write his own life story which they then interpreted and analyzed. According to Martin Bulmer, it was &quot;the first systematically collected sociological life history&quot;.

The approach later lost momentum as quantitative methods became more prevalent in American sociology. The method was revived in the 1970s, mainly through the efforts of French sociologist Daniel Bertaux and Paul Thompson whose life history research focused on such professions as bakers and fishermen. Major initiatives of the life history method were undertaken also in Germany, Italy, and Finland.

In the German context, the life history method is closely associated with the development of biographical research and biographical-narrative interviews. The narrative interview as a method for conducting open narrative interviews in empirical social research was developed in Germany around 1975. It borrowed concepts from phenomenology (Alfred Schütz), symbolic interactionism (George Herbert Mead), ethnomethodology (Harold Garfinkel), and sociology of knowledge (Karl Mannheim). The development and improvement of the method are closely connected to German sociologist Fritz Schütze, part of the Bielefeld Sociologist&#x27;s Working Group, which maintained close academic cooperation with American sociolinguists and social scientists such as Erving Goffman, Harvey Sacks, John Gumpertz, and Anselm Strauss. The analysis of life histories was further developed by the biographical case reconstruction method of German sociologist Gabriele Rosenthal for the analysis of life &quot;history&quot; and life &quot;story&quot;. Rosenthal differentiates between the level of analysis of the &quot;narrated&quot; life story (&quot;erzählte Lebensgeshichte&quot;) and the &quot;experienced&quot; life history (&quot;erlebte Lebensgeschichte&quot;).

==Technique==
In this method, the interviewer allows the subject to tell the story of their life on their own terms, as opposed to those of the researcher. It is common practice to begin the interview with the subject&#x27;s early childhood and to proceed chronologically to the present. Another approach, dating from the Polish Peasant, is to ask participants to write their own life stories. This can be done either through competitions (as in Poland, Finland or Italy) or by collecting written life stories written spontaneously. In these countries, there are already large collections of life stories, which can be used by researchers.

<text>In electrical engineering, spikes are fast, short duration electrical transients in voltage (voltage spikes), current (current spikes), or transferred energy (energy spikes) in an electrical circuit.

Fast, short duration electrical transients (overvoltages) in the electric potential of a circuit are typically caused by
* Lightning strikes
* Power outages
* Tripped circuit breakers
* Short circuits
* Power transitions in other large equipment on the same power line
* Malfunctions caused by the power company
* Electromagnetic pulses (EMP) with electromagnetic energy distributed typically up to the 100 kHz and 1 MHz frequency range.
* Inductive spikes

In the design of critical infrastructure and military hardware, one concern is of pulses produced by nuclear explosions, whose nuclear electromagnetic pulses distribute large energies in frequencies from 1 kHz into the gigahertz range through the atmosphere.

The effect of a voltage spike is to produce a corresponding increase in current (current spike). However some voltage spikes may be created by current sources. Voltage would increase as necessary so that a constant current will flow. Current from a discharging inductor is one example.

For sensitive electronics, excessive current can flow if this voltage spike exceeds a material&#x27;s breakdown voltage, or if it causes avalanche breakdown. In semiconductor junctions, excessive electric current may destroy or severely weaken that device. An avalanche diode, transient voltage suppression diode, varistor, overvoltage crowbar, or a range of other overvoltage protective devices can divert (shunt) this transient current thereby minimizing voltage.

Voltage spikes, also known as surges, may be created by a rapid buildup or decay of a magnetic field, which may induce energy into the associated circuit. However voltage spikes can also have more mundane causes such as a fault in a transformer or higher-voltage (primary circuit) power wires falling onto lower-voltage (secondary circuit) power wires as a result of accident or storm damage.

Voltage spikes may be longitudinal (common) mode or metallic (normal or differential) mode. Some equipment damage from surges and spikes can be prevented by use of surge protection equipment. Each type of spike requires selective use of protective equipment. For example, a common mode voltage spike may not even be detected by a protector installed for normal mode transients.

Power increases or decreases which last multiple cycles are called swells or sags, respectively. An uninterrupted voltage increase that lasts more than a minute is called an overvoltage. These are usually caused by malfunctions of the electric power distribution system.

<doc id="319616" wikidata="Q275462" url="?curid=319616" title="Presumption of innocence">
<text>The presumption of innocence is a legal principle that every person accused of any crime is considered innocent until proven [[guilt (law)|guilty]]. Under the presumption of innocence, the legal burden of proof is thus on the prosecution, which must present compelling evidence to the trier of fact (a judge or a jury). If the prosecution does not prove the charges true, then the person is acquitted of the charges. The prosecution must in most cases prove that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be acquitted. The opposite system is a presumption of guilt.

In many countries and under many legal systems, including common law and civil law systems (not to be confused with the other kind of civil law, which deals with non-criminal legal issues), the presumption of innocence is a legal right of the accused in a criminal trial. It is also an international human right under the UN&#x27;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 11.

== History ==

=== Roman law ===
The sixth-century &quot;Digest&quot; of Justinian (22.3.2) provides, as a general rule of evidence: &quot;Proof lies on him who asserts, not on him who denies&quot;. It is there attributed to the second and third century jurist Julius Paulus. It was introduced in Roman criminal law by emperor Antoninus Pius.

A civil law system is a modern legal system derived from the ancient Roman legal system (as opposed to the English common law system). The maxim and its equivalents have been adopted by many countries that use a civil law system, including Brazil, China, France, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Romania and Spain.

=== Talmudical law ===
According to Talmud, &quot;every man is innocent until proved guilty. Hence, the infliction of unusual rigours on the accused must be delayed until his innocence has been successfully challenged. Thus, in the early stages of the trial, arguments in his defence are as elaborate as with any other man on trial. Only when his guilt has become apparent were the solicitous provisions that had been made to protect defendants waived&quot;.

=== Islamic law ===
The presumption of innocence is fundamental to Islamic law where the principle that the onus of proof is on the accuser or claimant is strongly held, based on a hadith documented by Imam Nawawi. &quot;Suspicion&quot; is also highly condemned, this also from a hadith documented by Imam Nawawi as well as Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim.

After the time of Muhammad, the fourth Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib has also been cited to say, &quot;Avert the prescribed punishment by rejecting doubtful evidence.&quot;

=== Medieval European law ===
After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the West began to practice feudal law, which was a synthesis of aspects of Roman law as well as some Germanic customs according to the new elite, including presumed guilt. For instance, the accused could prove his innocence by having twelve people swear that he could not have done what he was accused of. In practice, this tended to favor the nobility over the lower classes, whose witnesses risked being seen as less credible.

Trials by ordeal were common from the 6th century until the early 13th century, and were known to continue into the 17th century in the form of witch-hunts. Whilst common in early Germanic law, compurgation was formally adopted in Rome by Pope Innocent III in 1215 at the Fourth Lateran Council and trials by fire and water specifically were forbidden. This was during the period of development of the , the canon law of the Catholic Church influenced the common law during the medieval period

In the early 13th century, Louis IX of France banned all trials by ordeal and introduced the presumption of innocence to criminal procedures. This did not last for long and the institutional use of torture, called &quot;question préalable&quot; and subdivided into &quot;question ordinaire&quot; (light torture) and &quot;question extraordinaire&quot; (severe torture), applied at the judge&#x27;s discretion against individuals suspected of a crime, was to last up to the eve of the French Revolution.

==Meaning==
&quot;Presumption of innocence&quot; serves to emphasize that the prosecution has the obligation to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt (or some other level of proof depending on the criminal justice system) and that the accused bears no burden of proof. This is often expressed in the phrase &quot;presumed innocent until proven guilty&quot;, coined by the British barrister Sir William Garrow (1760–1840) during a 1791 trial at the Old Bailey. Garrow insisted that accusers be robustly tested in court. An objective observer in the position of the juror must reasonably conclude that the defendant almost certainly committed the crime. In 1935, in its judgment of &quot;Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions&quot;, the English Court of Appeal would later describe this concept as being &#x27;the golden thread&#x27; running through the web of English criminal law. Garrow&#x27;s statement was the first formal articulation of this.

The presumption of innocence was originally expressed by the French cardinal and canonical jurist Jean Lemoine in the phrase &quot;&quot;item quilbet presumitur innocens nisi probetur nocens&quot; (a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty)&quot;, based on the legal inference that most people are not criminals. This referred not merely to the fact that the burden of proof rests on the prosecution in a criminal case, but the protections which a defendant should be given: prior notice of the accusation being made against them, the right of confrontation, right to counsel, etc. It is literally considered favorable evidence for the accused that automatically attaches at trial. It requires that the trier of fact, be it a juror or judge, begin with the presumption that the state is unable to support its assertion. To ensure this legal protection is maintained, a set of three related rules govern the procedure of criminal trials. The presumption means:

#With respect to the critical facts of the case—whether the crime charged was committed and whether the defendant was the person who committed the crime—the state has the entire burden of proof.
#With respect to the critical facts of the case, the defendant does not have any burden of proof whatsoever. The defendant does not have to testify, call witnesses or present any other evidence, and if the defendant elects not to testify or present evidence, this decision cannot be used against them.
#The jury or judge is not to draw any negative inferences from the fact the defendant has been charged with a crime and is present in court and represented by an attorney. They must decide the case solely on evidence presented during the trial.

Blackstone&#x27;s ratio as expressed by the English jurist William Blackstone in his seminal work, &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, published in the 1760s, said that:

The idea subsequently became a staple of legal thinking in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions and continues to be a topic of debate.

This duty on the prosecution was famously referred to as the &quot;golden thread&quot; in the criminal law by Lord Sankey LC in &quot;Woolmington v DPP&quot;:
==Fundamental right==
This right is considered important enough in modern democracies, constitutional monarchies and republics that many have explicitly included it in their legal codes and constitutions:

* The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11, states: &quot;Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense.&quot;
*The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 14, paragraph 2 states that &quot;Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.&quot; The presumption of innocence is also expressly regulated in Art. 66 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, according to which &quot;Everyone shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty before the Court in accordance with the applicable law.&quot;
* The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe says (art. 6.2): &quot;Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.&quot; This convention has been adopted by treaty and is binding on all Council of Europe members. Currently (and in any foreseeable expansion of the EU) every country member of the European Union is also member to the Council of Europe, so this stands for EU members as a matter of course. Nevertheless, this assertion is iterated &quot;verbatim&quot; in Article 48 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
* In the UK, the presumption of innocence is provided for by section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which aims to incorporate the rights contained in the aforementioned European Convention on Human Rights.
* Articles 8 (1) and 8 (2) (right to a fair trial), in conjunction with Article 1 (1) (obligation to respect and ensure rights without discrimination), of the American Convention on Human Rights make the Inter-American Court to stress that &quot;the presumption of innocence is a guiding principle in criminal trials and a foundational standard for the assessment of the evidence. Such assessment must be rational, objective, and impartial in order to disprove the presumption of innocence and generate certainty about criminal responsibility. ... The Court reiterated that, in criminal proceedings, the State bears the burden of proof. The accused is not obligated to affirmatively prove his innocence or to provide exculpatory evidence. To provide counterevidence or exculpatory evidence is a right that the defence may exercise in order to rebut the charges, which in turn the accusing party bears the burden of disproving&quot;.
* In Brazil, article 5th, item LVII of the Constitution states: &quot;no one will be considered guilty until the final criminal sentence is reached&quot;.
* In Canada, section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states: &quot;Any person charged with an offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal&quot;.
* In the Colombian constitution, Title II, Chapter 1, Article 29 states that &quot;Every person is presumed innocent until proven guilty according to the law&quot;.
* In France, article 9 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, which has force as constitutional law, begins: &quot;Any man being presumed innocent until he has been declared guilty ...&quot; The Code of Criminal Procedure states in its preliminary article that &quot;any person suspected or prosecuted is presumed innocent for as long as their guilt has not been established&quot; and the jurors&#x27; oath repeats this assertion (article 304; note that only the most serious crimes are tried by jury in France). A popular misconception is that, under French law, the accused is presumed guilty until proven innocent.
* In Iran, Article 37 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran states: &quot;Innocence is to be presumed, and no one is to be held guilty of a charge unless his or her guilt has been established by a competent court&quot;.
* In Italy, the second paragraph of Article 27 of the Constitution states: &quot;A defendant shall be considered not guilty until a final sentence has been passed.&quot;
* In Romania, article 23 of the Constitution states that &quot;any person shall be presumed innocent until found guilty by a final decision of the court&quot;.
* The Constitution of Russia, in article 49, states that &quot;Everyone charged with a crime shall be considered not guilty until his or her guilt has been proven in conformity with the federal law and has been established by the valid sentence of a court of law&quot;. It also states that &quot;The defendant shall not be obliged to prove his or her innocence&quot; and &quot;Any reasonable doubt shall be interpreted in favor of the defendant&quot;.
* In the South African Constitution, section 35(3)&quot;(h)&quot; of the Bill of Rights states: &quot;Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be presumed innocent, to remain silent, and not to testify during the proceedings.&quot;
* Although the Constitution of the United States does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The case of &quot;Coffin v. United States&quot; (1895) established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes. See also &quot;In re Winship.&quot;
* In New Zealand, the New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990 provides at section 25 (c) &quot;Everyone who is charged with an offence has, in relation to the determination of the charge, the following minimum rights: (c) the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law&quot;.
* In the European Union, in addition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, presumption of innocence is also protected through Directive (EU) 2016/343 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the 9th March 2016 on the strengthening of certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to bepresent at the trial in criminal proceedings (Directive). Article 3 states that: Member States shall ensure that suspects and accused persons are presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. The goal of the directive is stated in article 1. The scope is to lay down common minimum rules concerning:(a) certain aspects of the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings;(b) the right to be present at the trial in criminal proceedings.

==Modern practices==

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom changes have been made affecting this principle. Defendants&#x27; previous convictions may in certain circumstances be revealed to juries. Although the suspect is not compelled to answer questions after formal arrest, failure to give information may now be prejudicial at trial. Statute law also exists which provides for criminal penalties for failing to decrypt data on request from the police. If the suspect is unwilling to do so, it is an offence. Citizens can therefore be convicted and imprisoned without any evidence that the encrypted material was unlawful. Furthermore, in sexual offence cases such as rape, where the sexual act has already been proved beyond reasonable doubt, there are a limited number of circumstances where the defendant has an obligation to adduce evidence that the complainant consented to the sexual act, or that the defendant reasonably believed that the complainant was consenting. These circumstances include, for example, where the complainant was unconscious, unlawfully detained, or subjected to violence.

===Canada===
In Canadian law, the presumption of innocence has been reinforced in certain instances. The &quot;Criminal Code&quot; previously contained numerous provisions according to which defences to certain offences were subject to a reverse onus: that is, if an accused wishes to make that defence, they had to prove the facts of the defence to a balance of probabilities, rather than the Crown having to disprove the defence beyond a reasonable doubt. This meant that an accused in some circumstances might be convicted even if a reasonable doubt existed about their guilt. In several cases, various reverse onus provisions were found to violate the presumption of innocence provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They were replaced with procedures in which the accused merely had to demonstrate an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the proposed defence, following which the burden shifted to the Crown to disprove the defence.

Bill C-51, &quot;An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Department of Justice Act and to make consequential amendments to another Act&quot;, received Royal Assent in December 2018. Among other things, it eliminated several reverse onus provisions from the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, some of which had previously been found unconstitutional, and others pre-emptively in order to avoid further &quot;Charter&quot; challenges.

<text>Carnival Cruise Line is an international cruise line with headquarters in Doral, Florida. The company is a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc. Its logo is a funnel shaped like a whale&#x27;s tail, with a red, white, and blue color scheme. This trademark funnel design is built onto the line&#x27;s ships. Carnival is ranked first on the list of largest cruise lines based on passengers carried annually.

, Carnival Cruise Line operates a fleet of 27 ships. Two ships will join the fleet from P&amp;O Cruises Australia in 2025, as well as five new ships in 2027, 2028, 2029, 2031, and 2033.

==Company structure==

Carnival is one of ten cruise lines owned by the world&#x27;s largest cruise ship operator, the American-British Carnival Corporation &amp; plc. In 2021, Carnival Cruise Line was estimated to hold a 7.6% share of cruise industry revenue and 18.2% of passengers. It has 24 vessels and is the largest fleet in the Carnival group. The ships fly flags of convenience: 17 of the ships fly the Panama flag and seven that of the Bahamas. Its headquarters are in Miami, Florida, United States. The North American division of Carnival Corporation has executive control over the corporation and is headquartered in Doral, Florida.

==History==
Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 by Ted Arison. To finance the venture, Arison turned to his friend Meshulam Riklis, who owned Boston-based American International Travel Service (AITS). Arison and Riklis set up the new company as a subsidiary of AITS. AITS was to market and promote the new venture. In 1974, due to regulatory issues, Riklis sold AITS&#x27;s interest in the company to Arison for $1, but subject to Arison taking over the substantial company debts. The split enabled Arison to enter into new relationships with independent travel agents. He also promoted his cruises to younger people. The format was very successful financially.

=== 1970s: Early years ===
Carnival Cruise Line commenced sailings from Miami with their first ship the &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; in 1972, a former transatlantic liner purchased from Canadian Pacific Line. Carnival would adapt and evolve the green Canadian Pacific livery for their new logo, changing the colors to red, white and blue as seen today.

In 1975, Carnival acquired another former Canadian Pacific Line ship, renaming it the &quot;Carnivale&quot;. The success of the two ships led to the acquisition of their third ship in 1978, the TSS &quot;Festivale&quot;, another former ocean liner. With the success of the three ships, Carnival decided to build new ships to be able to compete with the rival Miami cruise lines.

=== 1980s: First new build ships ===
In 1982, Carnival introduced their first purpose-built ship, the &quot;Tropicale&quot;. This was the first ship on which the iconic winged funnel was introduced, which has since been used on all ships in the fleet; it was designed by Joe Farcus, who would become a longtime Carnival Cruise Line design collaborator.

In 1984, Carnival would introduce a new television marketing campaign during this time, starring Kathie Lee Gifford, who continues to be a longtime collaborator with the line.

Following the success of the &quot;Tropicale&quot;, and increased competition in Miami with newer ships, Carnival ordered the &quot;Holiday&quot; in 1985, followed by the &quot;Jubilee&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Celebration&quot; in 1987.

=== 1990s: Fleet expansion ===
Beginning in 1990, Carnival introduced the popular &quot;Fantasy&quot; class, beginning with the &quot;Fantasy&quot;, and completed with the eighth in the class &quot;Paradise&quot; in 1998. When completed, the Fantasy was one of the largest ships at the time and had the largest atrium at sea. After having done design work on all the previous Carnival ships, Joe Farcus continued as the lead designer for the entire class.

In 1993, Carnival began to get rid of their older second-hand tonnage, and sold their first ship, &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;, after 21 years of service with the line. The &quot;Carnivale&quot; followed the same year, going to newly created Carnival subsidiary Fiesta Marina Cruises.

In 1996, the new &quot;Destiny&quot; class was introduced, with the &quot;Carnival Destiny&quot;. At , it became the largest passenger ship in the world at the time and first to exceed 100,000 tons. The &quot;Destiny&quot;-class platform continued to be used in various iterations all the way to the &quot;Carnival Splendor&quot; in 2008. The same year the veteran ship &quot;Festivale&quot;, the last of the original second-hand fleet, was retired.

In 1998, the seventh ship in the &quot;Fantasy&quot; class, the &quot;Elation&quot;, was the first cruise ship to have the innovative azipod propulsion, used on most new cruise ships today. The &quot;Paradise&quot; also debuted in 1998, and was the first completely non-smoking cruise when it originally debuted.

=== 2000s: Early modern era ===

In 2001, the new Panamax size &quot;Spirit&quot; class debuted with the &quot;Carnival Spirit,&quot; the first of the four-ship class within the Carnival fleet.

In 2001, Robert H. Dickinson, then President and CTC, participated in a BBC documentary, &quot;Back To The Floor&quot;. Dickinson went to work at the lowest crew levels on the &quot;Imagination&quot; in the Caribbean, where he shadowed a Romanian cleaner, Alina. In October 2002, Carnival acquired P&amp;O Princess Cruises for 3.5 billion euro.

In 2001, Carnival transferred their first new build, the 1982 built &quot;Tropicale&quot; to Costa Cruises. Through the rest of the decade, the line would continue to sell, or transfer the other 1980s built ships to other lines, with the &quot;Jubilee&quot; in 2004, &quot;Celebration&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Holiday&quot; in 2009.

In 2004, Carnival Corporation initiated a development program for Carnival&#x27;s new ships, the Pinnacle Project, calling for a 200,000 GT prototype, which would have been the world&#x27;s largest cruise ship at the time. The ship was cancelled, but they then developed a project called Next Generation.

In 2009, Carnival released their biggest ship at the time, the &quot;Carnival Dream&quot;, a new ship. &quot;Carnival Dream&quot; entered service on 21 September 2009. After several voyages in the Mediterranean, she was set to offer weekly Caribbean cruises from Port Canaveral from December 5, 2009. A sister ship, &quot;Carnival Magic&quot;, debuted on May 1, 2011. On December 1, 2009, it was announced that Carnival had placed an order for a third &quot;Dream&quot;-class vessel. It entered service in June 2012 and its homeport is now Galveston. On May 10, 2010, Carnival selected a name for their new &quot;Dream&quot;-class vessel in 2012 – &quot;Carnival Breeze&quot;.

=== 2010s ===

On October 26, 2012, it was announced that Carnival had ordered a new 133,500 GT ship. This ship, built by Fincantieri, was the largest ship they have ever built. The new ship was named &quot;Carnival Vista&quot;, and sailed her maiden voyage on May 1, 2016, from Trieste, Italy.

In January 2017, Michael Thamm was appointed CEO of Carnival Asia to oversee operations in China and the surrounding region.

A sister to &quot;Carnival Vista&quot;, &quot;Carnival Horizon&quot;, joined the fleet with her inaugural voyage from Barcelona, Spain on April 2, 2018. Queen Latifah is the ship&#x27;s godmother, and christened her May 23, 2018.

&quot;Carnival Panorama&quot;, another sister to &quot;Carnival Vista&quot;, entered service as the cruise line&#x27;s flagship on December 11, 2019. She became the first new ship to homeport on the West Coast since &quot;Paradise&quot; (now &quot;Carnival Paradise&quot;) in 1998. Both ships sailed from Long Beach, California.

In February 2018, the company&#x27;s officials unveiled a major port development project in Ensenada, Mexico.

Reports in late June 2019 stated that Carnival was building their first terminal in Japan, in the port city of Sasebo, to be named Uragashira Cruise Terminal. Local officials were hoping that the terminal would be open by late July 2020.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Carnival Imagination&quot;, &quot;Carnival Inspiration&quot; were all sold for scrapping. &quot;Carnival Fascination&quot; was initially sold to another line, only to be resold for scrapping a year later.

In June 2021, it was announced that the Costa Magica would move from Costa Cruises to the Carnival fleet, and would receive a new name and the updated Carnival livery. On the same day, Carnival also announced that an Excel class ship previously under construction for AIDA Cruises would be transferred to Carnival. Later in the year, the name was revealed to be &quot;Carnival Jubilee.&quot;

On July 31, 2021, after numerous delays, the highly anticipated &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; entered service, sailing year round from Port Canaveral.

In early 2022, Carnival would announce the retirement of &quot;Carnival Sensation&quot; and &quot;Carnival Ecstasy&quot;, with Sensation being sold for recycling immediately, and Ecstasy remaining in the fleet until October 2022.

In June 2022, it was announced that &quot;Costa Luminosa&quot; would join the fleet as &quot;Carnival Luminosa&quot; replacing the previous announced plans of moving &quot;Costa Magica&quot; which would remain with Costa. It began cruises from Brisbane, Australia on November 6, 2022. It then does Alaskan cruises from Seattle in the summers before returning to Australia in the winters.

It was further announced in June 2022, that Carnival would create a new concept; Fun Italian Style, and bring over &quot;Costa Venezia&quot; and &quot;Costa Firenze&quot; and have the pair sail under the Carnival brand, while retaining their Italian designs and Costa funnels. Both ships will join the Carnival fleet in 2023 and 2024 respectively. On October 21, 2022, Carnival released renderings of the ships and announced that the ships would get Carnival names, becoming &quot;Carnival Venezia&quot; and &quot;Carnival Firenze.&quot; It was also announced that they would receive the blue livery with twist, having a yellow stripe instead of the red and white ones found on the other Carnival ships.

In December 2022, Carnival announced it had been forced to delay the debut of &quot;Carnival Jubilee&quot; from October 2023 to December 2023 because of ongoing supply chain issues at the Meyer Werft shipyard.

On May 29, 2023, the &quot;Carnival Venezia&quot; made its debut in Barcelona, Spain, ahead of its maiden season from Manhattan, New York.

In June 2024, it was announced that P&amp;O Cruises Australia would close in early 2025 and operations would be merged into Carnival Cruise Line. Two of their ships, Pacific Adventure and Pacific Encounter will be rebranded into Carnival ships and absorbed into Carnival Cruise Line from March 2025. These ships will continue to sail in the Australian region alongside &quot;Carnival Splendor&quot; and the seasonally based &quot;Carnival Luminosa&quot;. Carnival estimates that the transfer of the two ships, and the delivery of the two Excel-class ships by 2028, will result in a capacity increase of 50 percent since 2019.

In July 2024, Carnival announced the order of three new vessels from Fincantieri, each weighing approximately 230,000 GT and holding nearly 8,000 passengers. These ships are expected to be delivered in the summers of 2029, 2031, and 2033.

=== Leadership ===
Carnival has had five presidents since its foundation in 1972.
=== Effects of COVID-19 pandemic ===

In a filing with regulators, the company stated that as of July 31, 2020, it had $7.9 billion in &quot;cash and cash equivalent&quot; available. An industry news item estimated that this would enable Carnival to continue operating for roughly a year in a situation where none of the ships was sailing. A few days earlier, the company confirmed that it had sold the &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Carnival Inspiration&quot; (which were to be scrapped) and that &quot;Carnival Fascination&quot; and &quot;Carnival Imagination&quot; would move to long term layup (storage).

In April 2020, 18 Carnival ships meet up in the Bahamas in order to sail the crew home. 12 ships were used. &quot;Carnival Breeze&quot; and &quot;Carnival Magic&quot; both sailed to Europe with stops in Southampton, UK; Cadiz, Spain; Civitavecchia, Italy; Dubrovnik, Croatia; and Istanbul, Turkey. Carnival Glory sailed to the Caribbean with stops at St Lucia, St, Vincent, Jamaica, Mexico, and Panama, where it received crew from &quot;Carnival Miracle&quot;. &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot; sailed to Colon, Panama with the crew transiting to Central and South America from there. Carnival Dream and Carnival Conquest both sailed to east Asia with stops in Durban, South Africa and Manila, Philippines. &quot;Carnival Fascination&quot;, &quot;Carnival Liberty&quot;, and &quot;Carnival Ecstasy&quot; all sailed to Mumbai, India and Durban, South Africa. &quot;Carnival Panorama&quot; sailed from the west coast to the Philippines and Indonesia. Finally, after meeting up in Australia, &quot;Carnival Splendor&quot; sailed to Indonesia and &quot;Carnival Spirit&quot; sailed to the Philippines.

All cruises were cancelled in March 2020 due to the worldwide pandemic and eventually, 55 passengers on ships owned by Carnival Corporation &amp; plc were reported as having died. In September 2020, the corporation (the corporate umbrella of nine cruise ship companies, including Carnival Cruise Line) announced a reduction in its fleet. The company intended to dispose of 18 of its ships, a full 12% of the group&#x27;s fleet. By that time, several ships had already been scrapped, including the &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Carnival Inspiration&quot;. In September 2020, Carnival announced that &quot;Carnival Fascination&quot; and &quot;Carnival Imagination&quot; had been sold as well. Carnival Corporation also said that it was delaying the delivery of several ships already on order. The adjusted net loss in the third quarter for Carnival Corporation &amp; plc was reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as US$1.7 billion. For four straight fiscal quarters, Carnival Corporation &amp; plc had quarterly revenues of $50 million or less (as low as $26 million in the first quarter of 2021), compared to more than $4.7 billion of revenue in previous quarters.

As of September 2020, the no-sail rule by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prohibited cruising in the U.S. until October 31, 2020, at the earliest. Members of the Cruise Lines International Association, including Carnival Cruise Line, had announced in early August that its members were extending a voluntary suspension until October 31; that applied to cruises that were to depart from the U.S. or planned to stop at U.S. ports of call. On September 16, 2020, Carnival Cruise Line extended the suspension of four of its ships sailings well beyond October to complete required dry-dock enhancements.

Costa Cruises began new sailings on September 6, 2020, in Italy, initially with two ships, Costa Deliziosa and Costa Diadema, At that time, the line required all passengers to be from Italy. By September 27, 2020, however, &quot;Costa Cruises will be available for all European citizens who are residents in any of the countries listed in the most recent decree from the Prime Minister of Italy&quot; according to a news report. The company had implemented strict health protocols to protect its staff and guests.

The corporate parent&#x27;s 4th quarter (ending November 30, 2020) financial statement released on January 11, 2021, indicated that one extra ship, in addition to the 18 previously planned, was to be sold. Carnival Corporation was in an excellent cash position, with US$9.5 billion, but suffered an adjusted net loss of $1.9 billion in the quarter.

In June 2021, Carnival stock shares fell by 6% after it was announced that some early passengers from the first cruises of 2021 had tested positive for COVID-19.

More recently, as of October 23, 2022, Carnival Cruise line Passengers are not required to provide COVID-19 test prior to their arrival if the passenger is vaccinated and boosted.

==Controversies==

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, three of the Carnival cruise ships were chartered by the United States government for six months to serve as temporary housing, until houses could be rebuilt. After being chartered for six months, their planned voyages were cancelled, and passengers were refunded. &quot;Holiday&quot; was originally docked in Mobile, Alabama, and later Pascagoula, Mississippi, and &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Sensation&quot; were docked at New Orleans, Louisiana. The six-month contract cost $236 million. The contract was widely criticized, because the vessels were never fully utilized, and Carnival received more money than it would have earned by using the ships in their normal rotation.

===Employment===
In 2012, the company was reportedly paying cruise ship staff basic salaries equivalent to per hour. For example, a junior waiter would earn a basic salary of a month for shifts lasting at least 11 hours, seven days a week. In response to this controversy, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Brendan Barber, commented: &quot;It&#x27;s high time the disgraceful practice of allowing the shipping industry to pay poverty wages to workers who don&#x27;t live in the UK was stopped. Exploitative rates of pay for those working on British ships have no place in a modern society.&quot; In October 2013, Carnival revoked retirement benefits for cruise staff. In May 2012, Carnival dismissed 150 crew members from India for protesting low wages.

===Environmental and pollution===
Since 2017, Carnival Corporation has been on probation, after having been found to &quot;illegally dumping oil into the ocean from its Princess Cruises ships and lying about the scheme.&quot; Carnival Corporation also had to pay a $40 million fine. The court summary states that &quot;Princess was convicted and sentenced in April 2017, after pleading guilty to felony charges stemming from its deliberate dumping of oil-contaminated waste from one of its vessels and intentional acts to cover it up&quot;.

In April 2019, Carnival Corporation was accused of violating probation rules. The allegations include 800 incidents from April 2017 to April 2018. A federal judge has threatened to impose severe fines which may increase tenfold. The judge also stated that Carnival ships may be temporarily banned from docking in US ports. In early June 2019, Carnival Corp. agreed to pay $20 million in fines in an agreement with federal prosecutors. The proposed settlement documents were signed by Chairman Micky Arison on June 3, 2019. The next day, a Senior US District Judge approved the deal, and confirmed that probation would continue for three years, after CEO Arnold Donald said, &quot;The company pleads guilty. We acknowledge the shortcomings. I am here today to formulate a plan to fix them&quot;. The company promised to implement additional audits to check for violations, to provide improved training to staff, to start improved waste management practices and to set up a more effective method for reporting pollution incidents to government agencies.

In June 2019, Carnival Corporation and its Princess subsidiary agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $20 million for further environmental violations that include dumping plastic waste into the ocean. Princess Cruises had already paid $40 million over prior deliberate acts of ocean pollution.

== Accidents and incidents ==
On September 19, 1999, &quot;Tropicale&#x27;s&quot; engine room caught fire en route from Cozumel to Tampa. While disabled in the Gulf of Mexico, the ship was struck by Tropical Storm Harvey. The &quot;Tropicale&quot; spent two days without propulsion.

On November 8, 2010, a fire broke out in the generator room of &quot;Carnival Splendor&quot; and the ship lost power. The ship was adrift off the west coast of Mexico until she was towed to San Diego.

On February 10, 2013, &quot;Carnival Triumph&quot;, with 3,143 passengers aboard, suffered an engine room fire, leaving the ship adrift for four days in the Gulf of Mexico. The engine fire led to a power outage on the ship, which in turn caused raw sewage to back up. The media dubbed the ordeal &quot;The Poop Cruise&quot;. The ship was towed to Mobile, Alabama, docking on the evening of February 14. In subsequent litigation, Carnival documents were uncovered that revealed multiple generator maintenance problems creating a &quot;disaster waiting to happen&quot;. In response, Carnival&#x27;s court filing stated that the contract that passengers agree to when they buy a ticket &quot;makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions&quot;.

On March 14, 2013, &quot;Carnival Dream&quot; experienced an emergency generator failure while docked in port at Philipsburg, Sint Maarten. The ship was scheduled to leave port around 5 p.m. ET the day before. The United States Coast Guard said they were notified by Carnival that &quot;Carnival Dream&quot; was experiencing emergency generator problems. Carnival announced that the passengers would be flown back to Florida rather than completing their scheduled voyage.

On the morning of March 15, 2013, &quot;Carnival Legend&quot; suffered a mechanical problem with one propulsion pod while at sea. The cruise line cancelled &quot;Carnival Legend&quot;&#x27;s scheduled stops in Belize and Grand Cayman, and the ship returned to Tampa, Florida at a reduced speed of 19 knots (22 mph) (&quot;Legend&quot; has a regular cruising speed of 24 knots).

On December 27, 2015, an electrician who had been working on the &quot;Carnival Ecstasy&quot; was crushed to death while working in an elevator. The accident had heavy publicity after a video was posted online.

In February 2018, a series of fights broke out on the &quot;Carnival Legend&quot;. Staff were criticized for not containing the brawls and for exercising heavy force against passengers.

On May 3, 2018, a pipe burst in the &quot;Carnival Dream&quot;&#x27;s fire suppression system, flooding 50 staterooms.

In November 2018, the &quot;Carnival Sunshine&quot; experienced a technical issue which caused the ship to list for approximately one minute.

On December 29, 2018, lifeboat number 28 broke loose from the &quot;Carnival Dream&quot; for unknown reasons and was damaged. Carnival decided to abandon the lifeboat at sea and purchase a new replacement. No one was on board the lifeboat at the time and no injuries were reported.

In the evening on September 20, 2019, while passing through Panama Canal, the former &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot; collided with the lock&#x27;s wall and sustained damage to the aft superstructure. No injuries were reported. The collision occurred while the lock&#x27;s water levels were being lowered. The vessel was not under her own power but assisted/tugged by the Panama Canal&#x27;s locomotives. The accident occurred during the 10-day Panama Canal cruise.

On October 9, 2019, a 23-year-old passenger fell off a railing where he was sitting onto a lower deck while the &quot;Carnival Valor&quot; was sailing near Louisiana. He was flown to a New Orleans hospital by helicopter and said to be in critical condition.

On December 20, 2019, the &quot;Carnival Glory&quot; and &quot;Carnival Legend&quot; collided while in the port of Cozumel, Mexico; The &quot;Carnival Glory&quot;&#x27;s stern superstructure was damaged and one person received minor injuries.

On February 16, 2022, a 32-year-old woman leapt from the tenth deck of &quot;Carnival Valor&quot; after being detained by ship security. The search was suspended by the United States Coast Guard after 14 hours.

On May 26, 2022, the &quot;Carnival Freedom&quot; suffered a fire within her funnel. The vessel was docked in Grand Turk during the incident. The fire was extinguished with no injuries reported.

On June 28, 2022, a large fight aboard the &quot;Carnival Magic&quot; around 5:30 am prompted NYPD response upon arrival into New York City.

In June 2022, the New York Department of Financial Services announced a US$5 million fine for Carnival due to cybersecurity violations. The department stated that the violations were &quot;significant&quot; and that from 2019 to 2021 Carnival had four security breaches that exposed considerable amounts of consumer data. The department went on to state that Carnival failed to meet security regulation by not using two factor authentication and additionally did not report one of their data breaches.

<text>This is a list of cruise ships, both those in service and those that have ceased to operate. Ocean liners are included on this list only if they also functioned as cruise ships. (See: list of ocean liners.)

As some cruise ships have operated under multiple names, all names will be listed in the Status section, along with the history of the vessel, under the vessel&#x27;s &quot;current or most recent name&quot;. If a vessel is not currently operating as a cruise ship, only the most recent operation will be listed here. Likewise, if a vessel fulfilled another role before becoming a cruise ship, the first entry for the vessel will occur when the vessel began its career as a cruise ship.

==Classes of cruise ships==

<text>Verisign, Inc. is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure, including two of the Internet&#x27;s thirteen root nameservers, the authoritative registry for the , , and generic top-level domains and the country-code top-level domains, and the back-end systems for the and sponsored top-level domains.

In 2010, Verisign sold its authentication business unit – which included Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, public key infrastructure (PKI), Verisign Trust Seal, and Verisign Identity Protection (VIP) services – to Symantec for $1.28 billion. The deal capped a multi-year effort by Verisign to narrow its focus to its core infrastructure and security business units. Symantec later sold this unit to DigiCert in 2017. On October 25, 2018, NeuStar, Inc. acquired VeriSign&#x27;s Security Service Customer Contracts. The acquisition effectively transferred Verisign Inc.&#x27;s Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection, Managed DNS, DNS Firewall and fee-based Recursive DNS services customer contracts.

Verisign&#x27;s former chief financial officer (CFO) Brian Robins announced in August 2010 that the company would move from its original location of Mountain View, California, to Dulles in Northern Virginia by 2011 due to 95% of the company&#x27;s business being on the East Coast. The company is incorporated in Delaware.

== History ==

Verisign was founded in 1995 as a spin-off of the RSA Security certification services business. The new company received licenses to key cryptographic patents held by RSA (set to expire in 2000) and a time-limited non-compete agreement. The new company served as a certificate authority (CA) and its initial mission was &quot;providing trust for the Internet and Electronic Commerce through our Digital Authentication services and products&quot;. Prior to selling its certificate business to Symantec in 2010, Verisign had more than 3 million certificates in operation for everything from military to financial services and retail applications, making it the largest CA in the world.

In 2000, Verisign acquired Network Solutions for $21billion, which operated the , and TLDs under agreements with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the United States Department of Commerce. Those core registry functions formed the basis for Verisign&#x27;s naming division, which by then had become the company&#x27;s largest and most significant business unit. In 2002, Verisign was charged with violation of the Securities Exchange Act. Verisign divested the Network Solutions retail (domain name registrar) business in 2003 for $100million, retaining the domain name registry (wholesale) function as its core Internet addressing business.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, Verisign reported revenue of $681 million, up 10% from $616 million in 2009. Verisign operates two businesses, Naming Services, which encompasses the operation of top-level domains and critical Internet infrastructure, and Network Intelligence and Availability (NIA) Services, which encompasses DDoS mitigation, managed DNS and threat intelligence.

On August 9, 2010, Symantec completed its approximately $1.28 billion acquisition of Verisign&#x27;s authentication business, including the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate Services, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Services, the Verisign Trust Services, the Verisign Identity Protection (VIP) Authentication Service, and the majority stake in Verisign Japan. The deal capped a multi-year effort by Verisign to narrow its focus to its core infrastructure and security business units. Following ongoing controversies regarding Symantec&#x27;s handling of certificate validation, which culminated in Google untrusting Symantec-issued certificates in its Chrome web browser, Symantec sold this unit to DigiCert in 2017 for $950 Million.

On 14 December 2021, the Ministry of Justice, Communication and Foreign Affairs of the Tuvalu Government announced on Facebook that they have selected GoDaddy Registry as the new registry service provider for the domain after Verisign did not participate in the renewal process.

In 2011, Verisign was selected by the General Services Administration (GSA) to operate the registry services for the top-level domain. They continued to operate service until 2023, when Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) chose Cloudflare to replace Verisign as the .gov operator.

Verisign&#x27;s share price tumbled in early 2014, hastened by the U.S. government&#x27;s announcement that it would &quot;relinquish oversight of the Internet&#x27;s domain-naming system to a non-government entity&quot;. Ultimately ICANN chose to continue VeriSign&#x27;s role as the root zone maintainer and the two entered into a new contract in 2016.

== Naming services ==
Verisign&#x27;s core business is its naming services division. The division operates the authoritative domain name registries for two of the Internet&#x27;s most important top-level domains, and , and .name. It is the primary technical subcontractor for the and top-level domains for their respective registry operators, which are non-profit organizations; in this role Verisign maintains the zone files for these particular domains and hosts the domains from their domain servers. In addition, Verisign is also the contracted registry operator for the country code top-level domain (Cocos Islands). Registry operators are the &quot;wholesalers&quot; of Internet domain names, while domain name registrars act as the “retailers”, working directly with consumers to register a domain name address. It formerly was the contracted registry for .gov top-level domains as well as for the country code top-level domain .tv (Tuvalu).

Verisign also operates two of the Internet&#x27;s thirteen &quot;root servers&quot; which are identified by the letters A-M (Verisign operates the “A” and “J” root servers). The root servers form the top of the hierarchical Domain Name System that supports most modern Internet communication. Verisign also generates the globally recognized root zone file and is also responsible for processing changes to that file once they are ordered by ICANN via IANA and approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Changes to the root zone were originally distributed via the A root server, but now they are distributed to all thirteen servers via a separate distribution system which Verisign maintains. Verisign is the only one of the 12 root server operators to operate more than one of the thirteen root nameservers. The A and J root servers are &quot;anycasted” and are no longer operated from any of the company&#x27;s own datacenters as a means to increase redundancy and availability and mitigate the threat of a single point of failure. In 2016, the Department of Commerce ended its role in managing the Internet&#x27;s DNS and transferred full control to ICANN. While this initially negatively impacted VeriSign&#x27;s stock, ICANN eventually chose to contract with Verisign to continue its role as the root zone maintainer.

VeriSign&#x27;s naming services division dates back to 1993 when Network Solutions was awarded a contract by the National Science Foundation to manage and operate the civilian side of the Internet&#x27;s domain name registrations. Network Solutions was the sole registrar for all of the Internet&#x27;s non-governmental generic top-level domains until 1998 when ICANN was established and the new system of competitive registrars was implemented. As a result of these new policies, Network Solutions divided itself into two divisions. The NSI Registry division was established to manage the authoritative registries that the company would still operate, and was separated from the customer-facing registrar business that would have to compete with other registrars. The divisions were even geographically split with the NSI Registry moving from the corporate headquarters in Herndon, Virginia, to nearby Dulles, Virginia. In 2000, VeriSign purchased Network Solutions taking over its role in the Internet&#x27;s DNS. The NSI Registry division eventually became VeriSign&#x27;s naming services division while the remainder of Network Solutions was later sold by Verisign in 2003 to Pivotal Equity Group.

== Company properties ==
Following the sale of its authentication services division in 2010, Verisign relocated from its former headquarters in Mountain View, California, to the headquarters of the naming division in Sterling, Virginia (originally NSI Registry&#x27;s headquarters). Verisign began shopping that year for a new permanent home shortly after moving. They signed a lease for 12061 Bluemont Way in Reston, the former Sallie Mae headquarters, in 2010 and decided to purchase the building in September 2011. They have since terminated their lease of their current space in two buildings at Lakeside@Loudoun Technology Center. The company completed its move at the end of November 2011. The new headquarters is located in the Reston Town Center development which has become a major commercial and business hub for the region. In addition to its Reston headquarters, Verisign owns three data center properties. One at 22340 Dresden Street in Dulles, Virginia, not far from its corporate headquarters (within the large Broad Run Technology Park), one at 21 Boulden Circle in New Castle, Delaware, and a third in Fribourg, Switzerland. Their three data centers are mirrored so that a disaster at one data center has a minimal impact on operations. Verisign also leases an office suite in downtown Washington, D.C., on K street where its government relations office is located. It also has leased server space in numerous internet data centers around the world where the DNS constellation resolution sites are located, mostly at major internet peering facilities. One such facility is at the Equinix Ashburn Datacenter in Ashburn, Virginia, one of the world&#x27;s largest datacenters and internet transit hubs.

== Controversies ==

=== 2001: Code signing certificate mistake ===

In January 2001, Verisign mistakenly issued two Class 3 code signing certificates to an individual claiming to be an employee of Microsoft. The mistake was not discovered and the certificates were not revoked until two weeks later during a routine audit. Because Verisign code-signing certificates do not specify a Certificate Revocation List Distribution Point, there was no way for them to be automatically detected as having been revoked, placing Microsoft&#x27;s customers at risk. Microsoft had to later release a special security patch in order to revoke the certificates and mark them as being fraudulent.

=== 2002: Domain transfer lawsuit ===

In 2002, Verisign was sued for domain slamming – transferring domains from other registrars to themselves by making the registrants believe they were merely renewing their domain name. Although they were found not to have broken the law, they were barred from suggesting that a domain was about to expire or claim that a transfer was actually a renewal.

=== 2003: Site Finder legal case ===

In September 2003, Verisign introduced a service called Site Finder, which redirected Web browsers to a search service when users attempted to go to non-existent or domain names. ICANN asserted that Verisign had overstepped the terms of its contract with the U.S. Department of Commerce, which in essence grants Verisign the right to operate the DNS for and , and Verisign shut down the service. Subsequently, Verisign filed a lawsuit against ICANN in February 2004, seeking to gain clarity over what services it could offer in the context of its contract with ICANN. The claim was moved from federal to California state court in August 2004. In late 2005, Verisign and ICANN announced a proposed settlement which defined a process for the introduction of new registry services in the registry. The documents concerning these settlements are available at ICANN.org. The ICANN comments mailing list archive documents some of the criticisms that have been raised regarding the settlement.

=== 2003: Gives up domain ===

In keeping with ICANN&#x27;s charter to introduce competition to the domain name marketplace, Verisign agreed to give up its operation of top-level domain in 2003 in exchange for a continuation of its contract to operate , which, at the time had more than 34 million registered addresses.

=== 2005: Retains domain ===

In mid-2005, the existing contract for the operation of expired and five companies, including Verisign, bid for management of it. Verisign enlisted numerous IT and telecom heavyweights including Microsoft, IBM, Sun Microsystems, MCI, and others, to assert that Verisign had a perfect record operating . They proposed Verisign continue to manage the DNS due to its critical importance as the domain underlying numerous &quot;backbone&quot; network services. Verisign was also aided by the fact that several of the other bidders were based outside the United States, which raised concerns in national security circles. On June 8, 2005, ICANN announced that Verisign had been approved to operate until 2011. More information on the bidding process is available at ICANN. On July 1, 2011, ICANN announced that VeriSign&#x27;s approval to operate .net was extended another six years, until 2017.

=== 2010: Data breach and disclosure controversy ===

In February 2012, Verisign revealed that their network security had been repeatedly breached in 2010. Verisign stated that the breach did not impact the Domain Name System (DNS) that they maintain, but would not provide details about the loss of data. Verisign was widely criticized for not disclosing the breach earlier and apparently attempting to hide the news in an October 2011 SEC filing.

Because of the lack of details provided by Verisign, it was not clear whether the breach impacted the certificate signing business, acquired by Symantec in late 2010. Some, such as Oliver Lavery, the Director of Security and Research for nCircle, doubted whether sites using Verisign SSL certificates could be trusted.

=== 2010: Web site domain seizures ===

On November 29, 2010, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (U.S. ICE) issued seizure orders against 82 web sites with Internet addresses that were reported to be involved in the illegal sale and distribution of counterfeit goods. As registry operator for , Verisign performed the required takedowns of the 82 sites under order from law enforcement. &quot;InformationWeek&quot; reported that &quot;Verisign will say only that it received sealed court orders directing certain actions to be taken with respect to specific domain names&quot;. The removal of the 82 websites was cited as an impetus for the launch of &quot;the Dot-P2P Project&quot; in order to create a decentralized DNS service without centralized registry operators. Following the disappearance of WikiLeaks during the following week and its forced move to wikileaks.ch, a Swiss domain, the Electronic Frontier Foundation warned of the dangers of having key pieces of Internet infrastructure such as DNS name translation under corporate control.

=== 2012: Web site domain seizure ===
In March 2012, the U.S. government declared that it has the right to seize domains ending in , , , , , and if the companies administering the domains are based in the U.S. The U.S. government can seize the domains ending in , , , , and by serving a court-order on Verisign, which manages those domains. The domain is managed by the Virginia-based non-profit Public Interest Registry. In March 2012, Verisign shut down the sports-betting site Bodog.com after receiving a court order, even though the domain name was registered to a Canadian company.

<text>Robert L. Banks (November 24, 1921 – January 3, 1989) was an American chemist. He was born and grew up in Piedmont, Missouri. He attended the University of Missouri, Rolla, and initiated into Alpha Phi Omega in 1940. He joined the Phillips Petroleum company in 1946 and worked there until he retired in 1985. He died in Missouri on January 3, 1989.

==Technical contributions==
He was a fellow research chemist of J. Paul Hogan. They began working together in 1946, and in 1951 invented &quot;crystalline polypropylene&quot; and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These plastics were initially known by the name Marlex. The polymerization of ethylene was made possible by their discovery of the so-called Phillips catalyst.

==Recognition==

<text>A chain gang or road gang is a group of prisoners chained together to perform menial or physically challenging work as a form of punishment. Such punishment might include repairing buildings, building roads, or clearing land. The system was notably used in the convict era of Australia and in the Southern United States. By 1955 it had largely been phased out in the U.S., with Georgia among the last states to abandon the practice. Clallam County, Washington, U.S. still refers to its inmate litter crew as the &quot;Chain Gang.&quot; North Carolina continued to use chain gangs into the 1970s. Chain gangs were reintroduced by a few states during the 1990s: In 1995, Alabama was the first state to revive them. The experiment ended after about one year in all states except Arizona, where in Maricopa County inmates can still volunteer for a chain gang to earn credit toward a high school diploma or avoid disciplinary lockdowns for rule infractions.

== Synonyms and disambiguation ==

A single ankle shackle with a short length of chain attached to a heavy ball is known as &quot;a ball and chain&quot;. It limited prisoner movement and impeded escape.

Two ankle shackles attached to each other by a short length of chain are known as a &quot;hobble&quot; or as &quot;leg irons.&quot; These could be chained to a much longer chain with several other prisoners, creating a work crew known as a &quot;chain gang&quot;. The walk required to avoid tripping while in leg irons is known as the &quot;convict shuffle.&quot;A group of prisoners working outside prison walls under close supervision, but without chains, is a &quot;work gang&quot;. Their distinctive attire (stripe wear or orange vests or jumpsuits) and shaven heads served the purpose of displaying their punishment to the public, as well as making them identifiable if they attempted to escape. However, the public was often brutal, swearing at convicts and even throwing things at them.

The use of chains could be hazardous. Some of the chains used in the Georgia system in the first half of the 20th century weighed . Some prisoners suffered from &quot;shackle sores&quot;—ulcers where the iron ground against their skin. Gangrene and other infections were serious risks. Falls could imperil several individuals at once.

Modern prisoners are sometimes put into handcuffs or wrist manacles (similar to handcuffs, but with a longer length of chain) and leg irons, with both sets of manacles (wrist and ankle) being chained to a &quot;belly chain.&quot; This form of restraint is most often used on prisoners expected to be violent, or prisoners appearing in a setting where they may be near the public (a courthouse) or have an opportunity to flee (being transferred from a prison to a court). Although prisoners in these restraints are sometimes chained to one another during transport or other movement, this is not a chain gang—although reporters may refer to it as such—because the restraints make any kind of manual work impossible.

==Purpose==

Various claims as to the purpose of chain gangs have been offered. These include:
* punishment
* societal restitution for the cost of housing, feeding, and guarding the inmates. The money earned by work performed goes to offset prison expenses by providing a large workforce at no cost for government projects, and at minimal convict leasing cost for private businesses
* a way of perpetuating African-American servitude after the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ended slavery outside of the context of punishment for a crime.
* reducing inmates&#x27; idleness
* to serve as a deterrent to crime
* to satisfy the needs of politicians to appear &quot;tough on crime&quot;
* to accomplish undesirable and difficult tasks

== History ==

===Australia===

In the Australian penal colonies, chain gangs were also referred to as &quot;iron gangs&quot;. They were used as a punishment for convicts who reoffended after being transported. Iron gangs were frequently employed on the construction of roads in remote areas where escape was a possibility, such as on the Great North Road from Sydney to the Hunter Valley and the road from Sydney to Bathurst over the Blue Mountains. The leg irons were installed by blacksmiths using hot rivets, and then attached to a single &quot;gang chain&quot; to allow for control by an overseer. The irons and chains could weigh as much as or more. Some of the convicts on iron gangs were as young as 11 years old.

The use of iron gangs in the Colony of New South Wales was expanded by Governor Ralph Darling as part of his infrastructure program. Their tasks included &quot;breaking rocks, clearing trees, [and] constructing stone culverts and bridges&quot;. In 1828, the colony&#x27;s chief surveyor Edmund Lockyer directed that each iron gang could contain up to 60 men, supervised by one main overseer and three assistants. The iron gangs &quot;received the worst and least trustworthy characters, together with the strictest security measures&quot;. Better-behaved convicts still worked in gangs but were unshackled. Convicts who escaped from iron gangs were described as &quot;bolters&quot; and became some of the first bushrangers.

===United States===

The introduction of chain gangs into the United States began after the American Civil War. The Southern states needed finances and public works to be performed. Prisoners were a free way for these works to be achieved.

The use of chain gangs for prison labor was the preferred method of punishment in some Southern states like Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama.

Abuses in chain gangs led to reform and to their general elimination by 1955. There were still chain gangs in the South in December 1955.

Chain gangs experienced a resurgence when Alabama began to use them again in 1995; they still existed in 1997.

=== Reintroduction ===
Several jurisdictions in the United States have re-introduced prison labor. In 1995 Sheriff Joe Arpaio reintroduced chain gangs in Arizona.

A year after reintroducing the chain gang in 1995, Alabama was forced to again abandon the practice pending a lawsuit from the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other organizations. The SPLC&#x27;s attorney, J. Richard Cohen, said, &quot;They realized that chaining them together was inefficient; that it was unsafe&quot;. Alabama Prison Commissioner Ron Jones was fired in 1996 for trying to put female prisoners on chain gangs. However, as late as 2000, Jones had proposed reintroducing the chain gang.
In 2011, Tim Hudak, former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in Canada, campaigned on introducing penal labour in the province, referred to by many as chain gangs. He lost seats to the provincial Liberals which formed another majority government in the subsequent general election.

According to their own policies, Britain First (a British far-right political organization) want to re-introduce chain gangs &quot;to provide labour for national public works&quot;. This is part of their aim to turn prisons from &quot;cosy holiday camps&quot; into &quot;a place of hard labour&quot;.

In 2013, Brevard County Jail in Sharpes, Florida reintroduced chain gangs as a deterrent on crime in a pilot project. Ex-convict Larry Lawton, critical of this move, said, &quot;Chain gangs send a bad message about our county&quot;, adding &quot;I don&#x27;t think people want to come to this county as a tourist or a beach person and see people in chains.&quot; Instead he proposed a better use of law enforcement resources would be to combat drug addiction because he says it is a &quot;contributing factor&quot; to criminal activity.

<text>Marlex is a trademarked name for a crystalline polypropylene and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These plastics were invented by J. Paul Hogan and Robert Banks, two research chemists at the Phillips Petroleum Company in 1951.

Interest in the material in the 1950s arose from its high melting point and tensile strength, making it more desirable than the more common form of polyethylene. For example, the medical community in 1958 was eager to use Marlex 50 crystalline polyethylene which softens at . Objects made of Marlex could be sterilized in high-temperature autoclaves without affecting their form.

Marlex was used by Wham-O for their Hula Hoops in the 1950s, which helped create a market for this form of plastic. It is now an integral part to a wide variety of products and markets around the world. Additionally, it can be used surgically as a reinforcing mesh in inguinal hernia repair.

<text>Foxton () is a town in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand - on the lower west coast of the North Island, in the Horowhenua district, southwest of Palmerston North and just north of Levin. The town is located close to the banks of the Manawatū River. It is situated on State Highway 1, roughly in the middle between Tongariro National Park and Wellington.

The slightly smaller coastal settlement of Foxton Beach is considered part of Foxton, and is located to the west, on the Tasman Sea coastline.

The population was as of 

Foxton has preserved its heritage — both Māori and Pākehā — through its parks, heritage buildings and four museums. The Manawatū River Loop and estuary creates an environment that features walkways and Ramsar wetlands with 93 species of birds.

==Changing identity==
The 50 or so flax mills that once operated in Foxton&#x27;s vicinity slowly disappeared before WWII, while the Feltex carpet factory closed in 2008, causing unemployment. What was once an industrious flax industry town, had to reinvent itself.

These days, Foxton is trying to create a new local economy, by attracting visitors from throughout the region. Several cafés intersperse the boutique shops on Main Street. A Cultural Park includes a Dutch windmill, a Māori carving workshop and the Flax Stripper Museum. De Molen hosts some 45,000 customers p.a. - while the multi-cultural community and visitor hub Te Awahou Nieuwe Stroom, attracts some 150,000 users through its doors annually.

As the centre piece of the Cultural Park, the Te Awahou Nieuwe Stroom facility was awarded a top &#x27;excellence&#x27; museum award in 2018. The Piriharakeke and Oranjehof museums, a gallery, and exhibitions enable visitors to reflect on their own heritage and family’s roots. The multi-cultural and multi-lingual Te Awahou Nieuwe Stroom reflects diversity, and offers learning spaces through its library, heritage room and children&#x27;s area with educational toys.

Foxton Beach caters to those interested in active life-style pursuits.

According to the Department of Conservation: &quot;The diversity and number of wading and shore birds that visit the Manawatu Estuary make it one of the best bird watching spots in the country.&quot;. Foxton Beach is a popular swimming and fishing spot that is patrolled in the weekends and public holidays in summer by the Foxton Surf Life Saving Club.

== Origins ==
The first inhabitants of the Manawatū area were Māori who probably arrived in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. Compared to other parts of the North Island the district was sparsely populated, but there was a major marae at Matakarapa, across the river from Te Awahou (now Foxton) as well as kāinga (villages) and pā (fortified villages) along much of the river. A number of tribes have occupied the area; the Rangitāne had replaced the Ngāti Ara and the Ngāti Mamoe by the 1800s and were in their turn invaded by the Ngāti Toa and allies so that in the 1840s the site of Te Awahou (which was to become Foxton) was occupied by the Ngāti Ngarongo and Ngati Takihiku under the leadership of Ihakara Tukumaru.

Foxton is the oldest European settlement in the southern Manawatū, although it was not the first. The original white settlement was Paiaka to the east, closer to the present town of Shannon in 1844. When Paiaka was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1855 the settlers moved downstream to Te Awahou, which was named &quot;Foxton&quot; from 1866. In the early years of European settlement it was an important trading post and shipping port as the sea was the easiest way to transport goods and people to the Manawatū. The Manawatū River was then the main access to the rich hinterland. The west coast of the lower North Island is not naturally supplied with harbours and the Foxton harbour had a dangerous bar at the river mouth. As the only real harbour between Whanganui and Wellington it was used anyway.

== History ==
Foxton was named after Sir William Fox, and has a history of flax stripping, which was used to make wool packs, matting and rope. Other industries associated with the town have included clothing manufacturing and sawmilling. The town is known for producing the soda drink Foxton Fizz, which commenced operation at 8 Whyte Street in 1918 although the products are now made in Putāruru. 

Early on, Foxton became a thriving regional centre, and with that status came a newspaper - the Manawatu Herald (est. in 1878).

It was only with the advent of the Palmerston North-Wellington railway that Palmerston North began to overtake it as the most important centre in the Manawatū. The central government had originally proposed that Foxton was to be on the route of the main line from Wellington to Auckland via Palmerston North, and a tramway linking Foxton and Palmerston North was upgraded into the Foxton Branch railway in the 1870s. However, due to government delays in extending the line further south, a group of Wellingtonian businessmen established the Wellington and Manawatu Railway (WMR), which announced in February 1881 that the &quot;West Coast&quot; line would run to Longburn, bypassing Foxton. This was a shorter and more direct route to Napier and Auckland, and avoided &quot;unproductive country&quot;.

When this line opened in 1886, Foxton&#x27;s status as a port slipped, and this position deteriorated further when the WMR was incorporated into the government&#x27;s national rail network in 1908. The branch railway closed in 1959, leaving only road access to the town.

The mycologist Kathleen Curtis (1892–1994) was born in Foxton.

===Flax booms===
The local Flax Stripper Museum tells the history of the once thriving flax industry, and claims Foxton as the Flax Capital of New Zealand.

NZ Flax (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) played a major role in Foxton&#x27;s development; indeed Foxton, rather than being a &quot;gold town&quot; or &quot;coal town&quot; was indisputably a &quot;flax town&quot;, sending their product overseas to be used worldwide as a substitute for manila.

The first traders at Paiaka and Shannon traded mostly for flax from the Maori, which was sent to Sydney. The first of the flax booms began in 1869, lasting for four years during which 22,000 tonnes of fibre passed through Foxton&#x27;s port. The late 1880s saw a short-lived flax boom that briefly allowed Foxton to once again grow and function as a bustling port.

A third flax boom, begun in 1898, was the most lasting and saw another increase in shipping, with over 10 steamers making regular visits. In 1903 the Moutoa Estate was developed as the main supply of flax. By 1908 problems with river silting and bar strandings meant that coastal shipping was avoiding Foxton. By 1916 there were only two ships coming into the port but in that year 97,000 bales of flax were shipped out from Foxton.

===The Whirokino Cut===
Deforestation of the inland Manawatū District in the late nineteenth century meant increased flooding and led to the creation of stopbanks, floodgates, and the Whirokino Cut. Completed in 1943 as part of the Lower Manawatu Flood Control Scheme, it was intended as a spillway but an unexpected flood broke through the upper end and diverted the river down the spillway, cutting off the Foxton loop of the river and causing great outcry at the time. The Ministry of Works said this was unintentional, but some residents felt it was done purposefully. The Foxton Loop now only has a tidal flow and is not connected to the river at its top end, the upper end of the Loop having silted up during a flood in 1953.

Though the Whirokino Cut is sometimes claimed as the reason Foxton failed to operate as a port, the dangerous bar and persistent silting were already providing problems and by the time the Cut was in place most shipping was already avoiding Foxton – it had already ceased to function as a port as early as 1942.
What always has remained though, is Foxton&#x27;s unique natural environment. The nearby Foxton Beach offers wetlands of international significance with godwits and multiple species of other rare birdlife, and a beach with plenty of surf, swimmers and fishermen and women.

The town is served by three InterCity buses a day and a commuter bus runs to Palmerston North at 7:05am, returning at 5:20pm. There is also a shoppers&#x27; bus to Levin on Fridays.

==Features==
Te Awahou Nieuwe Stroom and the Cultural Park is located in the centre of town. The fully restored BNZ building on Main Street, and the oldest cottage in the region &#x27;Nye Cottage&#x27; on Harbour Street are both within view of the Park. In 2003, a full size replica of a Dutch windmill, called De Molen was completed and opened. This working Stellingmolen windmill produces stone-ground flour, which can be purchased inside the mill&#x27;s Dutch Deli. Visitors can climb up three floors, to witness the wooden mechanical workings of the mill in action - examples of traditional Dutch 17th Century engineering. The miller sets the blades in motion on windy days, and is available for tours to explain the history of milling, or for a more casual conversation.

The Foxton Fizz factory, opened in 1918, is open to visitors.

The National Museum of Audio Visual Arts &amp; Sciences, also known as the MAVTech Museum, opened in the 1970s. It&#x27;s located in authentic restored movie theatre, first opened as the Coronation Hall in 1911, was exhibits the development of audiovisual technology.

<doc id="319653" wikidata="Q371213" url="?curid=319653" title="Bidet">
<text>A bidet (, ) is a bowl or receptacle designed to be sat upon in order to wash a person&#x27;s genitalia, perineum, inner buttocks, and anus. The modern variety has a plumbed-in water supply and a drainage opening, and is thus a plumbing fixture subject to local hygiene regulations. The bidet is designed to promote personal hygiene and is used after defecation, and before and after sexual intercourse. It can also be used to wash feet, with or without filling it up with water. Some people even use bidets to bathe babies or pets. In several European countries, a bidet is now required by law to be present in every bathroom containing a toilet bowl. It was originally located in the bedroom, near the chamber-pot and the marital bed, but in modern times is located near the toilet bowl in the bathroom. Fixtures that combine a toilet seat with a washing facility include the electronic bidet.

Opinions as to the necessity of the bidet vary widely over different nationalities and cultures. In cultures that use it habitually, such as parts of Western, Central and Southeastern Europe (especially France, Spain, Italy and Portugal), Eastern Asia and some Latin American countries such as Argentina or Paraguay, it is considered an indispensable tool in maintaining good personal hygiene. It is commonly used in North African countries, such as Egypt. It is rarely used in sub-Saharan Africa, Australia, and North America.

&quot;Bidet&quot; is a French loanword meaning &#x27;pony&#x27; due to the straddling position adopted in its usage.

==Applications==
Bidets are primarily used to wash and clean the genitalia, perineum, inner buttocks, and anus. Some bidets have a vertical jet intended to give easy access for washing and rinsing the perineum and anal area. The traditional separate bidet is like a wash-basin which is used with running warm water with the help of specific soaps, and may then be used for many other purposes such as washing feet.

==Types==
===Bidet shower===

A bidet shower (also known as &quot;bidet spray&quot;, &quot;bidet sprayer&quot;, or &quot;health faucet&quot;) is a hand-held triggered nozzle, similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer, that delivers a spray of water to assist in anal cleansing and cleaning the genitals after defecation and urination. In contrast to a bidet that is integrated with the toilet, a bidet shower has to be held by the hands, and cleaning does not take place automatically. Bidet showers are common in countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing.

Drawbacks include the possibility of wetting a user&#x27;s clothing if used carelessly. In addition, a user must be reasonably mobile and flexible to use a hand-held bidet shower.

===Conventional or standalone bidet===

A bidet is a plumbing fixture that is installed as a separate unit in the bathroom besides toilet, shower and sink, which users have to straddle. Some bidets resemble a large hand basin, with taps and a stopper so they can be filled up; other designs have a nozzle that squirts a jet of water to aid in cleansing.

===Add-on bidets===

There are bidets that are attachable to toilet bowls, saving space and obviating additional plumbing. A bidet may be a movable or fixed nozzle, either attached to an existing toilet on the back or side toilet rim, or replacing the toilet seat. In these cases, its use is restricted to cleaning the anus and genitals. Some bidets of this type produce a vertical water jet and others a more-or-less oblique one. Other bidets have one nozzle on the side rim aimed at both anal and genital areas, and other designs have two nozzles on the back rim. The shorter one, called the &quot;family nozzle&quot;, is used for washing the area around the anus, and the longer one (&quot;bidet nozzle&quot;) is designed for washing the vulva.

Such attachable bidets (also called &quot;combined toilets&quot;, &quot;bidet attachments&quot;, or &quot;add-on bidets&quot;) are controlled either mechanically, by turning a valve, or electronically. Electronic bidets are controlled with waterproof electrical switches rather than a manual valve. There are models that have a heating element which blows warm air to dry the user after washing, that offer heated seats, wireless remote controls, illumination through built in night lights, or built in deodorizers and activated carbon filters to remove odours. Further refinements include adjustable water pressure, temperature compensation, and directional spray control. Where bathroom appearance is of concern, under-the-seat mounting types have become more popular.

An add-on bidet typically connects to the existing water supply of a toilet via the addition of a threaded tee pipe adapter, and requires no soldering or other plumbing work. Electronic add-on bidets also require a GFCI protected grounded electrical outlet.

==Usage and health==
Personal hygiene is improved and maintained more accurately and easily with the use of both toilet paper and a bidet as compared to the use of toilet paper alone. In some add-on bidets with vertical jets, little water is used and toilet paper may not be necessary. Addressing hemorrhoids and genital health issues might also be facilitated by the use of bidet fixtures.

Because of the large surface of the basin, after-use and routine disinfection of stand-alone bidets require thoroughness, or microbial contamination from one user to the next could take place. Bidet attachments are sometimes included on hospital toilets because of their utility in maintaining hygiene. Hospitals must consider the use of bidet properly and consider the clinical background of patients to prevent cross-infection. Warm-water bidets may harbor dangerous microbes if not properly disinfected.

==Environmental aspects==
From an environmental standpoint, bidets can reduce the need for toilet paper. Considering that an average person uses only 0.5 litre (1/8 US gallon) of water for cleansing by using a bidet, much less water is used than for manufacturing toilet paper. An article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; concluded that using a bidet is &quot;much less stressful on the environment than using paper&quot;. &quot;Scientific American&quot; has also reported that if the US switched to using bidets, 15 million trees could be saved every year.

In the US, UK, and some other countries, wet wipes are heavily marketed as an upgrade from dry toilet paper. However, this product has been criticized for its adverse environmental impact, due to the non-biodegradable plastic fibers composing most versions. Although the wipes are promoted as &quot;flushable&quot;, they absorb waste fats and agglomerate into massive &quot;fatbergs&quot; which can clog sewer systems and must be cleared at great expense. Bidets are being marketed as cleaning better than toilet paper or wet wipes, with fewer negative environmental effects.

==Society and culture==
The bidet is common in Catholic countries and required by law in some. It is also found in some traditionally Eastern Orthodox and Protestant countries such as Greece and Finland respectively, where bidet showers are common.

In Islam, there are many strict rules concerning excretion; in particular, anal washing with water is required. Consequently, in Middle Eastern regions where Islam is the predominant religion, water for anal washing is provided in most toilets, usually in the form of a hand-held &quot;bidet shower&quot; or &quot;shattaf&quot;.

===Prevalence===
Bidets are becoming increasingly popular with the elderly and disabled. Combined toilet/bidet installations make self-care toileting possible for many people, affording greater independence. There are often special units with higher toilet seats allowing easier wheelchair transfer, and with some form of electronic remote control that benefits an individual with limited mobility or otherwise requiring assistance.

Bidets are common bathroom fixtures in the Arab world and in Catholic countries, such as France (present in 95% of households in 1990), Italy (the installation of a bidet in a bathroom has been mandatory since 1975), Spain (but in recent times new or renewed houses tend to have bathrooms without bidets, except the luxurious ones), and Portugal (installation is mandatory since 1975). They are also found in Southeastern European countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, Greece and Turkey. They are very popular in some South American countries, particularly Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, often with functions such as toilet seat warming, are commonly found in Japan, and are becoming more popular in other Asian countries.

In Northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland, bidet showers are common. Bidet showers are most commonly found in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East.

In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto, a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, and are found in approximately 76% of Japanese households . They are commonly found in hotels and some public facilities. These bidet-toilets, along with toilet seat and bidet units (to convert an existing toilet) are sold in many countries, including the United States.

Bidet seat conversions are much easier and lower cost to install than traditional bidets, and have disrupted the market for the older fixtures.

After a slow start in the 1990s, electronic bidets are starting to become more available in the United States. American distributors were directly influenced by their Japanese predecessors, as the founders of Brondell (established in 2003) have indicated. The popularity of add-on bidet units is steadily increasing in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, in part because of their ability to treat hemorrhoids or urogenital infections. In addition, shortages of toilet paper due to the coronavirus pandemic have led to an increased interest in bidets.

==Etymology==
&quot;Bidet&quot; is a French word for &#x27;pony&#x27;, and in Old French, meant &#x27;to trot&#x27;. This etymology comes from the notion that one &quot;rides&quot; or straddles a bidet much like a pony is ridden. The word &quot;bidet&quot; was used in 15th-century France to refer to the pet ponies that French royalty kept.

==History==

The bidet appears to have been an invention of French furniture makers in the late 17th century, although no exact date or inventor is known. The earliest written reference to the bidet is in 1710 in France and latter in 1726 in Italy. Although there are records of Maria Carolina of Austria, Queen of Naples and Sicily, requesting a bidet for her personal bathroom in the Royal Palace of Caserta in the second half of the 18th century, the bidet did not become widespread in Italy until after the Second World War. The bidet is possibly associated with the &quot;chamber pot&quot; and the &quot;bourdaloue&quot;, the latter being a small, hand-held chamber pot.

Historical antecedents and early functions of the bidet are believed to include devices used for contraception. Bidets are considered ineffective by today&#x27;s standards of contraception, and their use for that function was quickly abandoned and forgotten following the advent of modern contraceptives such as the pill.

By 1900, due to plumbing improvements, the bidet (and chamber pot) moved from the bedroom to the bathroom and became more convenient to fill and drain.

In 1928, in the United States, John Harvey Kellogg applied for a patent on an &quot;anal douche&quot;.

In 1965, the American Bidet Company featured an adjustable spray nozzle and warm water option, seeking to make the bidet a household item. The fixture was expensive, and required floor space to install; it was eventually discontinued without a replacement model.

The early 1980s saw the introduction of the electronic bidet from Japan, with names such as Clean Sense, Galaxy, Infinity, Novita, and of non-electric attachments such as Gobidet. These devices have attachments that connect to existing toilet water supplies, and can be used in bathrooms lacking the space for a separate bidet and toilet. Many models have additional features, such as instant-heating warm water, night lights, or a heated seat.

<text>The canton of St. Gallen or St Gall ( ; ; ; ) is a canton of Switzerland. Its capital is St. Gallen.

Located in northeastern Switzerland, the canton has an area of (5% of Switzerland) and a resident population close to half a million as of 2015 (6% of Switzerland). It was formed in 1803 as a conflation of the city of St. Gallen, the territories of the Abbey of St. Gall and various former subject territories of the Old Swiss Confederacy.

==History==

The canton of St. Gallen is an artificial construct of various historical territories, defined by Napoleon Bonaparte in the Act of Mediation in 1803. About half of the canton&#x27;s area corresponds to the acquisitions of the abbey of St. Gallen over centuries.

The city of St. Gallen became independent of the abbey in 1405. At the same time, the abbey lost control of Appenzell. Conversely, the Toggenburg was acquired by the Abbey in 1468. Both the city and the abbey were associates (&quot;Zugewandte Orte&quot;) of the Old Swiss Confederacy, but unlike Appenzell never joined as full members.

The territories at Lake Zürich, Walensee and Rheintal remained independent until 1798. In the Helvetic Republic, the northern parts of the modern canton together with Appenzell became the canton of Säntis, while its southern parts together with Glarus became the canton of Linth.

Before the 1798 French invasion,
the territory of the modern canton consisted of the free city of St. Gallen, the territories of the Abbey of St. Gallen (including Fürstenland and Toggenburg), the free city of Rapperswil, Pfäfers Abbey, Sargans and the independent lordships (bailiwicks) of Rheintal, Sax-Forstegg, Hohensax, Werdenberg, Windegg and Uznach.

In April 1798, the territories of the later canton of St. Gallen were divided between the cantons of Säntis and Linth of the Helvetic Republic, along with Appenzell, Glarus and parts of Schwyz.

However, the two new Cantons had immediate financial problems and were forced to institute a number of unpopular taxes and laws. The Abbey was secularized on 17 September 1798 and the Prince-Abbot Pankraz Vorster fled to Vienna. The unpopular laws and the closing of the Abbey caused unrest throughout the area. When the War of the Second Coalition broke out in 1799, an Austrian army marched into eastern Switzerland and returned the Prince-Abbot to his throne at the Abbey. However, his victory was short-lived. The Austrian and Russian armies were defeated outside Zürich and the French Army returned to St. Gallen driving the Prince-Abbot out. In 1803, as part of the Act of Mediation, the area joined the Swiss Confederation as the Canton of St. Gallen.

The cantonal constitution of 1803 was revised in 1814. Because of the confessional heterogeneity of the canton&#x27;s population, the 1814 constitution did unusually organise matters of religion, marriage and education not on a cantonal level but introduced a twofold division (confessional dualism), with separate Protestant and a Catholic assemblies subordinate to the legislative cantonal assembly (Grosser Rat).

The constitution was revised again in 1831, introducing elements of direct democracy. The constitution of 1831 divided the canton into 15 districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;), 
reduced to 14 in 1918 (fusion of Tablat district with St. Gallen district).

Due to continuing confessional squabbles over the organisation of schools, the canton eventually placed education under its authority in 1861. The constitution was revised again in 1890, with a stronger emphasis on direct democracy.
The 1890 constitution remained in effect, with numerous later changes, until 2001, the date of the latest revision of the cantonal constitution, when the division into districts was replaced by a division into eight constituencies (&quot;Wahlkreise&quot;), effective 1 January 2003.

==Geography==
The canton is located in the north east of Switzerland. It is bounded to the north by Lake Constance (&quot;Bodensee&quot;). To the east lies the Rhine valley. Over the Rhine are Austria (state of Vorarlberg) and Liechtenstein. To the south, the canton of St. Gallen is bounded by the cantons of Graubünden, Glarus and Schwyz. To the west lie the cantons of Zürich and Thurgau.

The two half cantons Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden are completely surrounded by lands of the canton of St. Gallen.

The main rivers of the canton are the Rhine, Thur, Linth and Seez. The topography changes from the plains, near river Rhine and Lake Constance, towards the mountainous areas of the Alps in the south (Appenzell Alps and Glarus Alps). About one third () of the canton is wooded, while nearly half is is used for farming. of the farm land is alpine pastures. Of the rest of the canton, is considered unproductive while is filled with housing or roads.

The altitude above the sea-level varies from (the lake of Constance) to (the Ringelspitz). The canton includes portions of the lake of Constance (), of the Walensee (rather over ), and of the lake of Zürich (), and several small lakes wholly within its limits.

The mountains of the canton include part of a thrust fault that was declared a geologic UNESCO World Heritage Site, under the name Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona, in 2008.

<text>Claude Allègre (; 31 March 1937 – 4 January 2025) was a French politician and scientist. His work in the field of isotope geochemistry was recognised with the award of many senior medals, including the Crafoord Prize for geosciences in 1986 and the William Bowie Medal of the American Geophysical Union in 1995. His political service included a three-year term as Minister of Education in France, from 1997 to 2000.

==Early life==
Allègre was born in Paris on 31 March 1937, and was the eldest of four children. His father was a professor of natural sciences, and his mother was a school headteacher. Allègre&#x27;s family was from the Hérault region of France.

== Background and scientific work ==
Allègre&#x27;s main area of research was in geochemistry. He started work in this field for his doctoral research, where he focussed on ways of dating rocks using isotope geochemistry; specifically radiometric dating. After realising that there was no laboratory in France where he could make measurements with the accuracy he was seeking, Allègre received a NATO grant and spent the summer of 1965 working at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. Here, Allègre began working with Jerry Wasserburg, and learned the techniques required for rubidium-strontium dating of rocks by mass spectrometry. Allègre returned to France, and over the next three years built a laboratory and began making isotopic measurements. He completed his doctoral thesis, titled &#x27;introduction to the systematic geochronology of open systems&#x27;, at the University of Paris in 1967. In 1968, he took up a position at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), where he then spent much of his scientific career, including a ten year stint as IPGP director from 1976 to 1986.

Over the next thirty years, Allègre and his research students, post-doctoral researchers and collaborators developed techniques that meant they were able to measure isotope abundances in rocks and minerals by mass spectrometry that set new standards of sensitivity and precision. This allowed Allègre and his team to develop new ideas about the age and chemical evolution of the outer parts of the Earth, and also provide new information and insight into the early history of the solar system, by dating meteorites. Allègre defined the new field of &#x27;chemical geodynamics&#x27;. This combined data from isotope geochemistry with constraints from geophysics to develop ideas about the long-term chemical evolution of the planet, from core-formation to crustal growth.

Allègre&#x27;s work had a substantial impact on the field of geochemistry, for which he received a number of awards and elections to national academies, including the US National Academy of Sciences in 1985, and the Royal Society in 2002. He was also awarded senior medals for his work, from the Geochemical Society (V.M. Goldschmidt award, 1986) and the American Geophysical Union (Bowie medal, in 1995). In 1986, he was jointly awarded the Crafoord Prize with Wasserburg, in recognition of their &#x27;pioneering work in isotope geology&#x27;.

===Scientific administration===
Allègre made many contributions to the organisation of the geological and geochemical sciences in France and Europe throughout his career. In 1981, he became the first president of the European Union of Geosciences (EUG), which was established to coordinate a biennial scientific congress for geoscientists across Europe. The EUG later merged with the European Geophysical Union, to become the European Geosciences Union (EGU), in 2004. In 1988, 
Allègre created the European Association of Geochemistry and presided over an inaugural international conference on geochemistry in Paris. This led to the establishment of the annual &#x27;Goldschmidt Conferences&#x27; of the international geochemistry community, in cooperation with the Geochemical Society which are held in alternate years in Europe, and in the United States. From 1992 to 1997, Allègre was director of the French national geological survey, the Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières.

In 2004, Allègre was presented with the distinguished service award of the Geochemical Society for his &#x27;enormous&#x27; service to the geochemical profession. In his citation, Al Hofmann commented that Allègre&#x27;s &#x27;actions have not always been popular ... but they have always been guided by far-sighted strategic thinking and planning, and usually by deep insight.&#x27; He also characterised Allègre&#x27;s approach to service as one that involved &#x27;hatching a far-flung idea ... hand picking a few people ... and then letting them do the work.&#x27;

===Scientific works===
Over the course of his career, Allègre published many scientific papers. He also authored a number of scientific monographs and textbooks, including:

* &quot;Introduction to geochemistry&quot; (1974) 
* &quot;Trace elements in igneous petrology : a volume in memory of Paul W. Gast&quot; (1978)
* &quot;From stone to star : a view of modern geology&quot; (1992)
* &quot;Isotope geology&quot; (2008) 

Allègre also wrote a number of popular science texts, on topics such as the history of the Earth and the plate tectonic revolution. His 1988 book, &quot;The behaviour of the Earth&quot;, gained praise from reviewers for presenting a perspective on the French scientific contributions to the history of plate tectonics. Historian of geology, David Leveson, cautioned that the narrative promoted a &#x27;Whiggish&#x27; telling of the story of plate tectonics as one of progress, from the viewpoint of an insider. While Allègre&#x27;s account of the new global geology of plate tectonics was &#x27;lyrical&#x27; and &#x27;rhapsodic&#x27;, Leveson argued that Allègre&#x27;s focus on progress meant that he was not able to successfully place &#x27;mobilist geology in its &quot;proper&quot; sociological context&#x27; in this book.

==Scientific controversies==

In 1976, Allègre and volcanologist Haroun Tazieff became involved in an intense and public quarrel about whether inhabitants should evacuate the areas surrounding the &quot;la Soufrière&quot; volcano on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, which had begun to show signs of unrest, including steam explosions. Allègre held that inhabitants should be evacuated, while Tazieff held that the Soufrière was harmless because all analyses pointed to a purely phreatic eruption with no sign of fresh magma. In part out of caution, the authorities decided to follow Allègre&#x27;s advice and evacuate. The eruptive crisis did not result in any damage, but the evacuation had very significant negative consequences. Allègre, as the director of Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, subsequently expelled Tazieff from that institute. The controversy dragged on for many years after the end of the eruption, and ended up in court.

== Political career ==
A one time member of the French Socialist Party, Allègre is better known to the general public for his political responsibilities, which included serving as Minister of Education of France in the Jospin cabinet from 4 June 1997 to March 2000, when he was replaced by Jack Lang. His outpourings of critiques against teaching personnel, as well as his reforms, made him increasingly unpopular in the teaching world. In 1996, Allegre published &quot;La Défaite de Platon&quot; (&quot;The defeat of Plato&quot;), described by mathematician Pierre Schapira in the Spring 1997 edition of &quot;Mathematical Intelligencer&quot; as &quot;one of the most savage broadsides against conceptual thought.&quot;

In the run-up to the 2007 French presidential election, he endorsed Lionel Jospin, then Dominique Strauss-Kahn, for the Socialist nomination, and finally sided with the ex-Socialist Jean-Pierre Chevènement, against Ségolène Royal. When Chevènement decided not to run, he publicly declined to support Royal&#x27;s bid for the presidency, citing differences over nuclear energy, GMOs and stem-cell research. He later became close to conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy.

== Views on global warming ==
In an article in 2006 entitled &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; in &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, a French weekly, Allègre cited evidence that Antarctica&#x27;s gaining ice and that Mount Kilimanjaro&#x27;s retreating snow caps, among other global-warming concerns, might be due to natural causes. He said that &quot;[t]he cause of this climate change is unknown&quot;. This represented a change of mind, since Allègre wrote in 1987 that &quot;By burning fossil fuels, man increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which, for example, has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century&quot;.

Allègre accused those agreeing with the mainstream scientific view of global warming of being motivated by money, saying that &quot;the ecology of helpless protesting has become a very lucrative business for some people!&quot;

In 2009, when it was suggested that Claude Allègre might be offered a position as minister in President Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s government, TV presenter and environmental activist Nicolas Hulot stated:
:&quot;He doesn&#x27;t think the same as the 2,500 scientists of the IPCC, who are warning the world about a disaster; that&#x27;s his right. But if he were to be recruited in government, it would become policy, and it would be a &quot;bras d&#x27;honneur&quot; to those scientists. [...] [It] would be a tragic signal, six months before the Copenhagen Conference, and something incomprehensible coming from France, which has been a leading country for years in the fight against climate change!&quot;

In a 2010 petition, more than 500 French researchers asked Science Minister Valérie Pécresse to dismiss Allègre&#x27;s book &quot;L&#x27;imposture climatique&quot;, claiming the book was &quot;full of factual mistakes, distortions of data, and plain lies&quot;. Allègre described the petition as &quot;useless and stupid&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Allègre suffered a heart attack while at a scientific conference in Chile in 2013. He was hospitalised, but survived. He died in Paris on 4 January 2025, at the age of 87.

<text>Stacy Ann &quot;Fergie&quot; Ferguson ( ; born March 27, 1975) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. As a child, Fergie starred on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; (1984–1989), and voiced Sally Brown in two &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials and in &quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&quot; (1984–1986). She later co-founded the girl group Wild Orchid, and performed on two albums in the 1990s.

During the 2000s, Fergie achieved international fame as a part of the hip hop group the Black Eyed Peas, recording four albums with them. Her debut solo album, &quot;The Dutchess&quot; (2006), peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;Glamorous&quot; and &quot;London Bridge&quot;, and the top-five singles &quot;Clumsy&quot; and &quot;Fergalicious&quot;. Her second solo album, &quot;Double Dutchess&quot; (2017), was released alongside a film and peaked at number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spawned the top 40 singles &quot;L.A. Love (La La)&quot; and &quot;M.I.L.F. $&quot;.

Fergie has acted in the disaster film &quot;Poseidon&quot; (2006), the double feature &quot;Grindhouse&quot; (2007), the musical drama &quot;Nine&quot; (2009), and the comedy film &quot;Marmaduke&quot; (2010). She also hosted the reality series &quot;The Four: Battle for Stardom&quot; (2018). Her other ventures include launching two footwear lines and five fragrances beginning with Avon&#x27;s &quot;Outspoken&quot; in 2010.

Fergie has sold over 35 million albums and 60 million singles worldwide. Her accolades include eight Grammy Awards and a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her among the top artists of the 2000s and named her Woman of the Year in 2010.

==Early life==
Stacy Ann Ferguson was born on March 27, 1975, in Hacienda Heights, California, to Terri (née Gore) and Jon Patrick Ferguson. Her father died in September 2021 at age 74. She has a younger sister named Dana Ferguson; their ancestry includes English, Irish, Mexican, and Scottish. Ferguson was raised Roman Catholic and attended Mesa Robles Middle School and Glen A. Wilson High School. She was a cheerleader, straight-A student, spelling bee champion, and Girl Scout.

==Career==
=== 1984–2001: Early acting and Wild Orchid ===
Fergie studied dance and began to do voiceover work. She provided the voice for Sally Brown in two made-for-television &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoons, &quot;It&#x27;s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown&quot; (1984) and &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Getting Married, Charlie Brown&quot; (1985), as well as on four episodes of &quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&quot;. From 1984 to 1989, Fergie starred on the TV show &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; and was the longest running cast member. She starred in the first six of the show&#x27;s nine seasons. Fergie was a member of the female trio Wild Orchid, which she fronted with Stefanie Ridel and fellow &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; star Renee Sandstrom. By 1992, the girls began meeting with record labels, but they still could not get a recording contract. They eventually signed a music publishing deal with Sony Publishing before signing a record contract with RCA Records in 1994.

Wild Orchid released their self-titled debut album in March 1997, which charted at #153 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In September 1998, they released their second album, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, which was a commercial failure, only selling 200,000 copies worldwide. From June 16 to August 28, 1999, they opened for Cher&#x27;s Do You Believe? tour alongside Cyndi Lauper, which took them to 52 cities across the United States and Canada. They completed a third album, which their record label declined to release, and Fergie left the group in September 2001. In 2006, Fergie told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that both frustrations with the band&#x27;s image and personal drug problems led her to leave Wild Orchid.

=== 2002–2005: Breakthrough with the Black Eyed Peas ===

The Black Eyed Peas were recording their third album, &quot;Elephunk&quot; (2003), when will.i.am invited Fergie to try out for the song &quot;Shut Up&quot;. She secured the gig and instantly bonded with the trio, going on to record five additional songs on the album. The following spring, shortly before &quot;Elephunk&quot; came out, Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine offered Fergie a permanent spot to take over vocal duties and fill the void left by background singer Kim Hill&#x27;s departure in 2000. In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas&#x27; new-found style, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that since 2002, when the group &quot;hired a blond bombshell named Stacy &quot;Fergie&quot; Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs – a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their United Colors of Benetton worldview.&quot; From &quot;Elephunk&quot; came &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot;, which became the Black Eyed Peas&#x27; first major hit: it peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the charts in several other countries. The album subsequently spawned &quot;Shut Up&quot;, which topped the charts in many markets. The third single from the album, &quot;Hey Mama&quot;, reached the top 10 in several European countries and later peaked at number twenty-three in the United States in 2004.

Their next album, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, was released on June 7, 2005, and debuted at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA. Their next and last commercially released single from the album was &quot;Pump It&quot;, which borrows much of its sound from &quot;Misirlou&quot;, specifically Dick Dale&#x27;s version; it peaked at number 8 in Australia and 18 in America. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Phunk with My Heart&quot;, was a hit in the United States, reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and earned them another Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. &quot;Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No.6 in both countries. &quot;My Humps&quot;, another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics, reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content; John Bush, writing for AllMusic, described it as &quot;one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium&quot;. Later in 2005, the Black Eyed Peas toured with Gwen Stefani, as supporting act. In December 2005, they embarked on the &quot;European Tour&quot;. In March 2006, the Black Eyed Peas toured again, as the featured headliner for the Honda Civic Tour.

===2006–2008: &quot;The Dutchess&quot; and expansion===

Fergie&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;The Dutchess&quot;, was released in September 2006. It was initially recorded in 2005. The songs on the album are &quot;from a seven-year period, but [Interscope CEO] Jimmy Iovine heard some [tracks] and was like, &#x27;This is great, let&#x27;s put it out&#x27;. One of the album&#x27;s executive producers and fellow Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am stated that she was &quot;writing about her personal struggles and casting her demons away and feminine power. [It&#x27;s] her singing for young girls to be strong, and what they&#x27;re going through in life, just growing up in this world of uncertainty.&quot; &quot;London Bridge&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on July 18, 2006, to radio stations and on August 7, 2006, on the iTunes Store. The urban pop track caused controversy due to its double entendre title, but became a huge success, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (for three weeks) and New Zealand charts, while also reaching the top-ten in over twelve countries. The music video for the song features the Black Eyed Peas members as well as Fergie on the Tower Bridge, among other scenes.

The following single, &quot;Fergalicious&quot;, was released on October 23, 2006. The track, which features will.i.am, reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the top-five in Australia and New Zealand, although it peaked lower than &quot;London Bridge&quot; in Europe. Its music video features Fergie as Willy Wonka in a candy factory. &quot;Glamorous&quot; was released as the third single from the album, on February 20, 2007. The track, which features Ludacris, became another number-one single for Fergie in the United States, and also reached the top-ten in over seven countries. The fourth single, &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, was released on May 22, 2007. The ballad became a huge success worldwide, topping the charts of ten countries, including Australia, Canada and the United States; it was also the album&#x27;s most successful single in Europe. It earned Fergie a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The music video for the song features American actor Milo Ventimiglia as her love interest. &quot;Clumsy&quot; was then selected to be the fifth and final single from the album. It was released on September 25, 2007 and became a top-ten hit in five countries, including in Australia and the United States, becoming her fifth consecutive top-five hit in the U.S.

In 2007, the Black Eyed Peas embarked on the Black Blue &amp; You World Tour and visited more than 20 countries. Fergie returned to acting in 2006, appearing as a lounge singer in the &quot;Poseidon&quot; remake. She later had supporting roles in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Grindhouse&quot; and the 2009 musical film &quot;Nine&quot;. Fergie and other members of the cast of &quot;Nine&quot; won the Satellite Award for Best Cast – Motion Picture and received nominations for the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Acting Ensemble and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture for their performances. On December 31, 2006, Fergie began hosting &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; on ABC for the pre-taped Hollywood segments after the New Year Ball came down in Times Square.

===2009–2012: Continued success with the Black Eyed Peas===

In early 2009, Fergie and the group left A&amp;M Records; both remained with Interscope Records. The group&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The E.N.D&quot; (&quot;The &quot;E&quot;nergy &quot;N&quot;ever &quot;D&quot;ies&quot;), was released on June 9, 2009. The overall sound of the album has a more electro hop beat rather than the usual hip pop/R&amp;B feeling of their previous albums. In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. They released &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; as the lead single from their fifth album, &quot;The E.N.D.&quot;, in March 2009. It went to number one in the United States and became the group&#x27;s first chart topper. As of March 2011, the album has sold over 3,000,000 copies in the US alone. In France, the album proved to be very successful. It spent 55 weeks inside of the top 10 with 11 at No. 1. They subsequently released a second single from the album, &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot;, which proved an even greater success than the first: it moved from number two behind &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; to the top spot in July, and stayed for 14 straight weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the longest stay at the top of 2009. The two hit singles back to back kept the Black Eyed Peas on the top for 26 consecutive weeks, from April 18 through October 16. Fergie bought a stake in the Miami Dolphins in 2009, and has performed at the team&#x27;s football games numerous times.

&quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot; was released as the third single from the album in September 2009. The single reached number one in the United Kingdom and Australia. It also peaked at seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In October 2009, Fergie became a part owner of the National Football League&#x27;s Miami Dolphins. &quot;Imma Be&quot; was released as the fourth single; it reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks. &quot;Rock That Body&quot; was then released as the fifth single and reached number nine on the U.S. charts. In September 2009, the group embarked on The E.N.D World Tour, visiting Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand. In October 2009, they also were the opening acts for 5 concerts of the U2 360° Tour North America leg.

The Black Eyed Peas performed at the Grammys on January 31, 2010. They performed a mash-up of &quot;Imma Be&quot;/&quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot;. They won 3 out of the 6 awards they were nominated for including Best Pop Vocal Album for &quot;The E.N.D.&quot;, Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Group for &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; and Best Short Form Video for &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot;. On July 27, 2010, the Black Eyed Peas released a remix album: &quot;The E.N.D. Summer 2010 Canadian Invasion Tour: Remix Collection&quot;. It was released on iTunes in Canada only, during the Canadian leg of The E.N.D World Tour. It mostly features remixes of the singles taken from &quot;The E.N.D.&quot; It also features a remix of &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot; taken from &quot;Elephunk&quot;; the remix was also a bonus track on the deluxe edition of &quot;The E.N.D.&quot;. She launched her debut fragrance, &quot;Outspoken&quot;, under Avon in May 2010. Her performance of Gimme Shelter with Mick Jagger and U2 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary in 2010 has over 13 million views.

Their sixth studio album, &quot;The Beginning&quot;, was released on November 30, 2010, and received mixed reviews. The album&#x27;s first single release was called &quot;The Time (Dirty Bit)&quot;. In January 2011, she began appearing in Dr Pepper Cherry commercials. &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, was released on February 18, 2011. The music video was released on March 16, 2011, and it was filmed in Tokyo, one week before the earthquake and the tsunami. The video was directed by Ben Mor. The group&#x27;s third single was &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Party&quot; and it was released on May 10, 2011. On the same day, a music video for the song was released on iTunes, along with the single. The video, which is directed by Ben Mor, features on stage and backstage footage of the group during The E.N.D. World Tour in 2009–10. The video premiered on Vevo on May 12, 2011. On May 22, the group appeared on the 2011 Billboard Music Awards and won 1 of their 4 nominations, for &quot;Top Duo/Group&quot;.

In 2013, Fergie announced that she had begun writing her second solo studio album. The same year, Fergie filed a claim at the Los Angeles County Superior Court to legally change her name to Fergie Duhamel and take the last name of her husband, Josh Duhamel. On January 6, 2014, it was announced, again, that Fergie was beginning the process of her second studio album. She stated in an interview with radio host Ryan Seacrest that will.i.am would be handling the production, with a release through Interscope. Later that year with &quot;Billboard&quot;, she revealed that her experiences with motherhood influenced her songwriting. In September 2014, it was announced that Fergie&#x27;s second studio album had been slated for a 2015 release. A new single from Fergie, titled &quot;L.A. Love (La La)&quot;, was released to contemporary hit radio on September 30, 2014. The song debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 97 and peaked at number 27. It also reached number 16 on the Rhythmic Songs, number eight on Hot Rap Songs, number 24 on the Digital Songs and number 20 on the Pop Songs radio chart.

On April 22, 2015, the singer performed a song with the Black Eyed Peas at the 2015 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival as part of David Guetta&#x27;s set. Fergie announced in June 2015 that she was putting the finishing touches on her second album, titled &quot;Double Dutchess&quot;. A teaser for the album titled &quot;Hungry (1st Byte)&quot; was released on June 9, 2016. On July 1, she released a new single, titled &quot;M.I.L.F. $&quot;. Fergie was inspired to write the song after the birth of her son, Axl. The music video was conceptualized by Fergie and features a group of famous mothers as lingerie-clad 1950s housewives. On November 11, 2016, Fergie released the third single from the album, &quot;Life Goes On&quot;. In November 2016, during a live Facebook chat, Fergie confirmed that the album would see its release in 2017.

In May 2017, it was announced that Fergie had parted ways—by mutual decision—with Interscope and would launch her own imprint, Dutchess Music, as part of a global partnership with BMG Rights Management. On June 2, 2017, a &quot;Billboard&quot; article rumored that Fergie was departing from the Black Eyed Peas. Band frontman will.i.am dismissed this, but stated that Fergie was taking a break from the group opting to concentrate on her solo career whilst the remaining members are working on a side project. The pre-order of &quot;Double Dutchess&quot; was made available on August 25, 2017, along with instant downloads of &quot;Hungry&quot; and &quot;You Already Know&quot;, collaborations with Rick Ross and Nicki Minaj respectively, with the latter being the fourth single from the album.

That same day, at the 2018 NBA All-Star Game, Fergie performed a controversial rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, which &quot;People&quot; described as a &quot;slowed-down jazzy rendition&quot; and &quot;Deadline&quot; reported it as being &quot;bluesy&quot; and &quot;breathy&quot;. She would later acknowledge that &quot;clearly this rendition didn&#x27;t strike the intended tone.&quot; Also in 2018, Fergie hosted the singing competition series &quot;The Four: Battle for Stardom&quot;, which ran for two seasons on Fox.

In 2020, 100 percent of the proceeds from Fergie Footwear&#x27;s holiday shoe were donated to Dress For Success, a global nonprofit organization that provides professional attire for low-income women.

== Artistry and reception ==
Fergie does not consider herself a rapper. In a 2006 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Fergie said of her vocal style: &quot;I love imitating instruments, sometimes you can&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m saying because I&#x27;m going for an instrumental sound. It would ruin the sound if I pronunciated correctly.&quot; She cites Selena as her first influence. Roxanne Shante, Monie Love, Salt-N-Pepa, and J. J. Fad are artists she looks up to, and &quot;The Dutchess&quot; pays homage to them. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, she said Beyoncé was a major influence for her album &quot;Double Dutchess&quot;. Other influences for her sophomore record are Amy Winehouse, Jhené Aiko, Ed Sheeran, Robert Plant, and Guns N&#x27; Roses.

Fergie has received attention for her work with the Black Eyed Peas and for her solo music. Leah Greenblatt of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that, with &quot;The Dutchess&quot;, &quot;she&#x27;s earned her Black Eyed independence – and perhaps even her new royal title.&quot; Retrospectively, Jason Lipshutz of &quot;Billboard&quot; called Fergie &quot;a fearlessly individual female artist that had been hiding in plain sight. [...] Fergie deserves retroactive praise for an uncompromising first look&quot;. With the release of &quot;Double Dutchess&quot;, Allan Raible of ABC News wrote: &quot;On her own, Fergie remains a versatile, exciting performer, further establishing her growing clout as an entertainer.&quot; Tara Joshi of &quot;The Guardian&quot; agreed, deeming Fergie &quot;pop royalty&quot;.

In a retrospective &quot;Paper&quot; article analyzing her image, Katherine Gillespie called her an &quot;imperfect popstar&quot; who &quot;managed to rise above these manufactured circumstances and establish a unique onstage persona that relied on fashion just as much as music to get its point across. [...] She featured in Worst Dressed columns, but also inspired millions of 14-year-olds to spend their allowances on cargo pants. That&#x27;s real influence.&quot;

Artists who have been influenced by Fergie include Ariana Grande and Jack Harlow. Harlow&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one song &quot;First Class&quot;, released in April 2022, samples Fergie&#x27;s song &quot;Glamorous&quot;.

== Achievements ==

As a solo artist, Fergie has sold over 7.2 million albums and 29 million singles worldwide. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she has sold 27.5 million albums &amp; singles in the United States.&quot;&quot; With her debut album &quot;The Dutchess&quot;, she became the first singer to have five singles from a debut album peak within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since Milli Vanilli&#x27;s &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; (1989). With those singles selling over two million digital downloads individually in the United States, she set a record in the digital era for the most multi-platinum singles from one album, which she held until 2012. She is the second female to achieve three &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 topping singles from one album, the first being Christina Aguilera. Her single &quot;London Bridge&quot; had the second fastest ascent in Hot 100 history, peaking at the top in three weeks.

Fergie has been nominated for five Brit Awards with the Black Eyed Peas. She has been nominated for twenty Grammy Awards, of which she has won eight: Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 2005 and 2006; Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 2007; Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Best Music Video in 2010; and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song in 2012. &quot;Blender&quot; named Fergie their woman of the year in 2007. &quot;Billboard&quot; named Fergie Woman of the Year in 2010, and the same publication ranked her 16th on the 2000s Top Female Artists of the Decade list.

==Personal life==
Fergie is bisexual. She said &quot;I&#x27;ve been in show business since I was a little girl, so [homosexuality] was always very normal to me. My mom taught me that every human is God&#x27;s child. You have to live your own life and not judge other people. Love is a great thing.&quot;

While performing with Wild Orchid, Fergie developed an addiction to crystal methamphetamine, which continued after her departure from the group in 2001. In September 2006, she called crystal &quot;the hardest boyfriend I ever had to break up with&quot;. Fergie also stated &quot;It&#x27;s the drug that&#x27;s addicting. But it&#x27;s why you start doing it in the first place that&#x27;s interesting. A lot of it was being a child actor; I learned to suppress feelings.&quot; She has stated in several interviews that she is an avid user of hypnotherapy, which she used to overcome her crystal meth addiction and to relax.

Fergie began dating actor Josh Duhamel in September 2004, after she met him when she and the Black Eyed Peas filmed a cameo appearance for an episode of Duhamel&#x27;s show &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. Fergie and Duhamel became engaged in December 2007; they married in a Catholic ceremony on January 10, 2009. They have one son named Axl Jack who was born on August 29, 2013. On September 14, 2017, Fergie and Duhamel announced that they had separated earlier that year. On June 1, 2019, the couple filed for divorce after two years of separation. The divorce was finalized in November 2019.

In 2013, Fergie constructed a house in Solvang, California, which she sold in 2023. Her home in Brentwood, Los Angeles was saved from the January 2025 Southern California wildfires by firefighters.

<text>John Howard Casper (born July 9, 1943) is a former American astronaut and retired United States Air Force pilot.

==Early life and education==
Although born on July 9, 1943, in Greenville, South Carolina, Casper considers Gainesville, Georgia to be his hometown. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Science from the United States Air Force Academy in 1966, and a Master of Science degree in Astronautics from Purdue University in 1967.

==Military career==
Before he was an astronaut, Casper was a United States Air Force (USAF) fighter pilot, earning his pilot wings at Reese Air Force Base, Texas. After F-100 Super Sabre training at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, he flew 229 combat missions with the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing in the Vietnam War. Following his tour in Vietnam, Casper flew F-100 and F-4 Phantom aircraft while assigned to the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, Royal Air Force Lakenheath, United Kingdom.

Casper was selected to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and graduated with class 74A. After graduating he became Chief of the F-4 Test Team; he flew initial performance and weapons separation tests for the F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft and avionics tests for F-4E and A-7 Corsair II aircraft. Casper then became operations officer and later commander of the 6513th Test Squadron, where he conducted flight test programs to evaluate and develop tactical aircraft weapons systems. He was then assigned to Headquarters, USAF at the Pentagon and was Deputy Chief of the Special Projects Office, where he developed USAF positions on requirements, operational concepts, policy and force structure for tactical and strategic programs.

Colonel Casper has logged over 10,000 flying hours in 52 different aircraft.

Selected by NASA in May 1984, Casper became an astronaut in June 1985. A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 825 hours in space. He was the pilot on mission STS-36, and spacecraft commander on missions STS-54, STS-62 and STS-77. His technical assignments while assigned to the Astronaut Office included Chief of the Operations Development Branch; lead for improvements to the nosewheel steering, brakes, tires, and development of a landing drag chute; astronaut team leader for the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); and ascent/entry spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center.

===Space flights===

STS-36 launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990, aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. This mission carried classified Department of Defense payloads and was unique in that it flew at 62 degrees inclination, the highest inclination flown to date by the U.S. human space flight program. After 72 orbits of the Earth, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 4, 1990, after traveling 1.87 million miles. Mission duration was 106 hours, 19 minutes, 43 seconds.

STS-54 launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 13, 1993, aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. A crew of five successfully accomplished the primary objectives of this six-day mission, including deploying a $200 million NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-F), which joined four other satellites to complete a national communications network supporting Space Shuttle and other low-Earth orbit scientific satellites. A Diffuse X-Ray Spectrometer (DXS) carried in the payload bay collected X-ray data to enable investigators to answer questions about the origin of X-rays in the Milky Way galaxy. A highly successful extravehicular activity (EVA) resulted in many lessons learned that benefited the International Space Station assembly. The flight was also the first to shut down and restart a fuel cell in flight, successfully demonstrating another Space Station application. Casper landed &quot;Endeavour&quot; at the Kennedy Space Center on January 19, 1993, after 96 Earth orbits covering over 2.5 million miles. Mission duration was 143 hours and 38 minutes.

STS-62 (March 4–18, 1994) was a two-week microgravity research mission aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. Its primary payloads were the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-2) and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST-2) payloads. These payloads included experiments to understand the process of semiconductor crystal growth, investigating the process of metal alloys as they solidify, studying materials at their critical point (where they exist as both a liquid and gas), and testing new technology for use on future spacecraft, such as advanced solar arrays, radiators, heat sinks, and radiation shielding. The flight also tested new technology for aligning the Remote Manipulator System arm and for grasping payloads with a new magnetic end effector. &quot;Columbia&quot; flew at a record low altitude of 195 km (105 nautical miles) to gather data on spacecraft glow and erosion caused by atomic oxygen and nitrogen molecules. Casper landed &quot;Columbia&quot; at the Kennedy Space Center after 224 Earth orbits and 5.82 million miles.

STS-77 (May 19–29, 1996) was a ten-day mission aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The crew performed a record number of rendezvous sequences (one with a SPARTAN satellite and three with a deployed Satellite Test Unit) and approximately 21 hours of formation flying in close proximity of the satellites. During the flight the crew also conducted 12 experiments in materials processing, fluid physics and biotechnology in a Spacehab Module. STS-77 deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN satellite, which carried the Inflatable Antenna Experiment designed to test the concept of large, inflatable space structures. A small Satellite Test Unit was also deployed to test the concept of self-stabilization by using aerodynamic forces and magnetic damping. Casper brought &quot;Endeavour&quot; back to Earth at the Kennedy Space Center after 160 Earth orbits and 4.1 million miles. Mission duration was 240 hours and 39 minutes.

==Post-flight Career==
Following his last Shuttle mission, Colonel Casper has served in positions of increasing responsibility in NASA. He was Director of Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance at the Johnson Space Center, where he was responsible for all safety, reliability and quality activities for JSC&#x27;s human spaceflight programs, including the International Space Station, the Space Shuttle, Space Launch Initiative, and Crew Return Vehicles. He also was responsible for planning, directing and implementing an effective institutional safety program to prevent injuries, loss of life, or loss of capital assets.

After the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in February 2003, Casper became the NASA Mishap Investigation Team&#x27;s deputy for the debris recovery operation, which involved directing the efforts of over 6,000 ground, air, and water search personnel, as well as protection and impoundment of debris. He was Co-Chair of the Return-To-Flight Planning Team, a NASA Headquarters-chartered independent team charged with addressing all actions necessary to comply with the Columbia Accident Investigation Board recommendations. He then joined the Space Shuttle program and became Manager of the Management Integration and Planning Office, responsible for Return-to-Flight planning and management integration across all program elements. Casper is currently Associate Manager of the Space Shuttle Program, assisting the program manager in the management, integration, and operations of the program.

In 2022, Casper published an autobiography of his experience in space titled &quot;The Sky Above: An Astronaut’s Memoir of Adventure, Persistence, and Faith&quot;.

==Honors==
Colonel Casper has been awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal, two Legion of Merit Awards, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, 11 Air Medals, two Defense Meritorious Service Medals, six Air Force Commendation Medals, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, four NASA Space Flight Medals, and the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement.

<doc id="319670" wikidata="Q4745722" url="?curid=319670" title="Amerikamura">
<text>Amerikamura (also America mura; アメリカ村, &quot;American Village&quot;) is a sizable retail and entertainment area near Shinsaibashi in the Chūō-ku district of Osaka, Japan. It is usually referred to by locals as &quot;Ame-mura&quot;. Amerikamura is an area stretching from Nagahori Street to Dotonbori, located in the west side of the Shinsaibashi station.

Amerikamura is identifiable by a small-scale reproduction of the Statue of Liberty that peers down on the streets. It is a well-known haunt of expatriates, and centres on Triangle Park, a concrete rest area surrounded by retail outlets of Western fashions, bars and nightclubs, some of which are run by Westerners.

Its reputation as a hangout for foreigners is a matter of degree. Osaka&#x27;s registered foreign population is a small fraction of the total population; the makeup of the crowds and retail space in Ame-mura is predominantly Japanese. Locally, Ame-mura is known for being a place for observing some of the more &quot;fashion intense&quot; manifestations of Japanese pop culture.

In 1983, the &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; mural was painted in Amerikamura by artist Seitaro Kuroda.

<doc id="319671" wikidata="Q1851405" url="?curid=319671" title="Met Office">
<text>The Met Office, until November 2000 officially the Meteorological Office, is the United Kingdom&#x27;s national weather and climate service. It is an executive agency and trading fund of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology  and is led by CEO Penelope Endersby, who took on the role as Chief Executive in December 2018 and is the first woman to do so. The Met Office makes meteorological predictions across all timescales from weather forecasts to climate change.

Although an executive agency of the UK Government, the Met Office supports the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive in their functions and preparations ahead of intense weather and planning for extreme weather alerts. Met Office policies can be used by each government to inform their planning and decision making processes. The Met Office has an office located in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh, and a forecasting centre in Aberdeen in the north–east of Scotland, which are some of the services used to help the Scottish Government with objectives such as climate change. 

== History ==
 The Met Office was established on 1 August 1854 as a small department within the Board of Trade under Vice Admiral Robert FitzRoy as a service to mariners. The loss of the passenger vessel, the &quot;Royal Charter&quot;, and 459 lives off the coast of Anglesey in a violent storm in October 1859 led to the first gale warning service. FitzRoy established a network of 15 coastal stations from which visual gale warnings could be provided for ships at sea.

The new electric telegraph enabled rapid dissemination of warnings and also led to the development of an observational network which could then be used to provide synoptic analysis. The Met Office started in 1861 to provide weather forecasts to newspapers. FitzRoy requested the daily traces of the photo-barograph at Kew Observatory (invented by Francis Ronalds) to assist in this task and similar barographs and as well as instruments to continuously record other meteorological parameters were later provided to stations across the observing network. Publication of forecasts ceased in May 1866 after FitzRoy&#x27;s death but recommenced in April 1879.

=== Connection with the Ministry of Defence ===

Following the First World War, the Met Office became part of the Air Ministry in 1919, the weather observed from the top of Adastral House (where the Air Ministry was based) giving rise to the phrase &quot;The weather on the Air Ministry roof&quot;. As a result of the need for weather information for aviation, the Met Office located many of its observation and data collection points on RAF airfields, and this accounts for the large number of military airfields mentioned in weather reports even today. In 1936 the Met Office split with services to the Royal Navy being provided by its own forecasting services.

It became an executive agency of the Ministry of Defence in April 1990, a quasi-governmental role, being required to act commercially.

===Changes of ministry===

Following a machinery of government change, the Met Office became part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on 18 July 2011, and subsequently part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy following the merger of BIS and the Department of Energy and Climate Change on 14 July 2016.

Although no longer part of the MOD, the Met Office maintains strong links with the military through its front line offices at RAF and Army bases both in the UK and overseas and its involvement in the Joint Operations Meteorology and Oceanography Centre (JOMOC) with the Royal Navy. The Mobile Met Unit (MMU) are a unit consisting of Met Office staff who are also RAF reservists who accompany forward units in times of conflict advising the armed forces of the conditions for battle, particularly the RAF.

== Locations ==
In September 2003 the Met Office moved its headquarters from Bracknell in Berkshire to a purpose-built £80m structure at Exeter Business Park, near junction 29 of the M5 motorway. The new building was officially opened on 21 June 2004 – a few weeks short of the Met Office&#x27;s 150th anniversary – by Robert May, Baron May of Oxford.

It has a worldwide presenceincluding a forecasting centre in Aberdeen, and offices in Gibraltar and on the Falklands. Other outposts lodge in establishments such as the MetOffice@Reading (formerly the Joint Centre for Mesoscale Meteorology) at University of Reading in Berkshire, the Joint Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Research (JCHMR) site at Wallingford in Oxfordshire, and there is a Met Office presence at Army and Air Force bases within the UK and abroad (including frontline units in conflict zones). Royal Navy weather forecasts are generally provided by naval officers, not Met Office personnel.

== Forecasts ==

=== Shipping Forecast ===

The Shipping Forecast is produced by the Met Office and broadcast on BBC Radio 4, for those traversing the seas around the British Isles.

=== Weather forecasting and warnings ===
The Met Office issues Severe Weather Warnings for the United Kingdom through the National Severe Weather Warning Service (NSWWS). These warn of weather events that may affect transport infrastructure and endanger people&#x27;s lives. In March 2008, the system was improved and a new stage of warning was introduced, the &#x27;Advisory&#x27;.

The Met Office along with Irish counterpart Met Éireann introduced a storm naming system in September 2015 to provide a single authoritative naming system for the storms that affect the UK and Ireland. The first named storm under this system, Abigail was announced on 10 November 2015. In 2019, the Met Office and Met Éireann were joined by Dutch national weather forecasting service the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI).

=== Weather prediction models ===
The main role of the Met Office is to produce forecast models by gathering information from weather satellites in space and observations on earth, then processing it with a variety of models, based on a software package known as the unified model. The principal weather products for UK customers are 36-hour forecasts from the operational 1.5 km resolution UKV model covering the UK and surroundings (replacing the 4 km model), 48-hour forecasts from the 12 km resolution NAE model covering Europe and the North Atlantic, and 144-hour forecasts from the 25 km resolution global model (replacing the 40 km global model). The Met Office&#x27;s Global Model forecast has consistently been in the top 3 for global weather forecast performance (in the decades up to 2010) in independent verification to WMO standards. Products for other regions of the globe are sold to customers abroad, provided for MOD operations abroad or provided free to developing countries in Africa. If necessary, forecasters may make adjustments to the computer forecasts. Data is stored in the Met Office&#x27;s own PP-format.

===Flood Forecasting Centre===

Formed in 2009, the Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) is a joint venture between the Environment Agency and the Met Office to provide flood risk guidance for England and Wales. The Centre is jointly staffed from both parent organisations and is based in the Operations Centre at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter. 

====Scottish Flood Forecasting Service====

In Scotland this role is performed by the Scottish Flood Forecasting Service, a joint venture between the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Met Office.

=== Seasonal forecasts ===
The Met Office makes seasonal and long range forecasts and distributes them to customers and users globally. The Met Office was the first climate and weather forecast provider to be recognised as a Global Producing Centre of long range forecasts by the World Meteorological Organisation and continues to provide forecasts to the WMO for dissemination to other national meteorological services worldwide.

Met Office research has broken new ground in seasonal forecasting for the and has demonstrated its abilities in its seasonal predictions of the North Atlantic Oscillation and winter climate for Europe and North America.

=== Supply of forecasts for broadcasting companies ===
One of the main media companies, ITV produce forecasts for ITV Weather using the Met Office&#x27;s data and animated weather symbols.

The BBC used to use Met Office forecasts for all of its output, but on 23 August 2015, it was announced that the BBC would be replacing the Met Office with MeteoGroup, a competing provider, as part of the corporation&#x27;s legal obligation to provide best value for money for the licence fee payers. The BBC still uses some Met Office data for certain forecasts, particularly severe weather warnings and the Shipping Forecast.

=== World Area Forecast Centre ===

The Met Office is one of only two World Area Forecast Centres or WAFCs, and is referred to as WAFC London. The other WAFC is located in Kansas City, Missouri, and known as WAFC Washington. WAFC data is used daily to safely and economically route aircraft, particularly on long-haul journeys. The data provides details of wind speed and direction, air temperature, cloud type and tops, and other features.

=== Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre ===

As part of its aviation forecast operation the Met Office operates the London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC). This provides forecasts to the aviation industry of volcanic ash clouds that could enter aircraft flight paths and impact aviation safety. The London VAAC, one of nine worldwide, is responsible for the area covering the British Isles, the north east Atlantic and Iceland. The VAAC were set up by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations, as part of the International Airways Volcano Watch (IAVW). The London VAAC makes use of satellite images, plus seismic, radar and visual observation data from Iceland, the location of all of the active volcanoes in its area of responsibility. The NAME dispersion model developed by the Met Office is used to forecast the movement of the ash clouds 6, 12 and 18 hours from the time of the alert at different flight levels.

=== Air quality ===

The Met Office issues air quality forecasts made using NAME, the Met Office&#x27;s medium-to-long-range atmospheric dispersion model. It was developed as a nuclear accident model following the Chernobyl accident in 1986, but has since evolved into an all-purpose dispersion model capable of predicting the transport, transformation and deposition of a wide class of airborne materials. NAME is used operationally by the Met Office as an emergency response model as well as for routine air quality forecasting. Aerosol dispersion is calculated using the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols model.

The forecast is produced for pollutants and their typical health effects are shown in the following table.
Decadal Predictions

The Met Office coordinates the production and collation of decadal climate prediction from climate centres around the world as part of its responsibilities as World Meteorological Organisation Lead Centre for Annual to Decadal Climate Prediction. These predictions are updated each year and a summary, the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update is published each year.

===IPCC===

Until 2001 the Met Office hosted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group, chaired by John Houghton, on climate science. In 2001 the working group moved to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

=== High performance computing ===
Due to the large amount of computation needed for Numerical Weather Prediction and the Unified model, the Met Office has had some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. In November 1997 the Met Office supercomputer was ranked third in the world.
=== Customer service===
Since 2012 the Met Office Contact Centre (known as the Weather Desk) has been part of Contact Centre Panel&#x27;s &#x27;Top 50 Companies for Customer Service&#x27; programme.

In 2015 the Met Office won awards in the following categories:
* Rated 1st Overall for Combined Channels
* Most Improved Overall for Social Media
* Rated 2nd Overall for Call Service
* Rated 1st Overall for Email Service
* Best in Public Sector
* Best Extra Small Centre

== Weather stations ==
Reports (observations) from weather stations can be automatic (totally machine produced), semi-automatic (part-machine and part manual), or manual. Some stations produce manual observations during business hours and revert to automatic observations outside these times. Many stations feature &quot;present weather&quot; sensors, CCTV, etc. There is also a network of &#x27;upper air&#x27; stations, using radiosondes. The six main radiosonde stations in the UK are Camborne, Lerwick, Albemarle, Watnall, Castor Bay and Herstmonceux.

Some stations have limited reporting times, while other report continuously, mainly RAF and Army Air Corps stations where a staffed met office is provided for military operations. The &quot;standard&quot; is a once-hourly reporting schedule, but automatic stations can often be &quot;polled&quot; as required, whilst stations at airfields report twice-hourly, with additional (often frequent in times of bad weather) special reports as necessary to inform airfield authorities of changes to the weather that may affect aviation operations.

Some stations report only CLIMAT data (e.g. maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall totals over a period, etc.) and these are usually recorded at 0900 and 2100 hours daily. Weather reports are often performed by observers not specifically employed by the Met Office, such as Air traffic control staff, coastguards, university staff and so on.

==Meteorological Research Unit and the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM)==

Meteorological Research was carried out at RAE Bedford with instruments being carried by barrage balloons until the RAE facility closed in the 1980s.

The Met Office association with Cardington continues by maintaining a Meteorological Research Unit (MRU). This is responsible for conducting research into part of the atmosphere called the boundary layer by using a tethered balloon which is kept in a small portable hangar.

===FAAM===
The Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM), part of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, is based at Cranfield Airport. It is a collaboration with the Natural Environment Research Council.

The FAAM was established as part of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS), itself part of NERC, to provide aircraft measurement for use by UK atmospheric research organisations on worldwide campaigns. The main equipment is a modified BAe 146 type 301 aircraft, registration G-LUXE, owned and operated by BAE Systems on behalf of Directflight Limited.

Areas of application include: 
* Radiative transfer studies in clear and cloudy air;
* Tropospheric chemistry measurements;
* Cloud physics and dynamic studies;
* Dynamics of mesoscale weather systems;
* Boundary layer and turbulence studies;
* Remote sensing: verification of ground-based instruments;
* Satellite ground truth: radiometric measurements and winds;
* Satellite instrument test-bed;
* Campaigns in the UK and abroad.

<text>Jack Mathieu Émile Lang (; born 2 September 1939) is a French politician. A member of the Socialist Party, he served as Minister of Culture from 1981 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1993, as well as Minister of National Education from 1992 to 1993 and 2000 to 2002.

He was also Mayor of Blois from 1989 until his resignation in 2000. Lang is best known for originating the Fête de la Musique in 1982 as Culture Minister, an all day public music festival which occurs yearly on 21 June in France and throughout the world. Since 2013 he has been president of the Arab World Institute in Paris.

==Early life==
Jack Lang was born to Roger Lang and Marie-Luce Bouchet in Mirecourt, in the département of Vosges. His father was from a secular, assimilated, well-to-do Jewish family based in Nancy. Roger Lang was the commercial manager of the family business which was founded by Jack&#x27;s grandfather Albert. Roger and Albert were both freemasons. Jack&#x27;s mother, Marie-Luce Bouchet, a Catholic, was born in 1919 to Emile Bouchet, who died in 1926, and Berthe Boulanger, a nurse who was also a freemason.

In 1938, Albert and Roger sent their wives to Vichy because of the threat of war with Germany. After the German invasion, Albert Lang and his wife moved to Brive-la-Gaillarde in Corrèze. The very young Jack and his mother went to stay with his great-grandmother (the mother of Berthe Boulanger) in Cholet and subsequently moved to Bordeaux. His father Roger was first mobilized in Luneville, and then joined his parents and his brother-in-law Luc Bouchet in Brive. Jack and his mother also joined them in Brive after the bombing of Bordeaux. Jack Lang&#x27;s father was sentenced by the court in Brive for failing to report his children as Jews, but was later acquitted by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the children&#x27;s mother was a Catholic. He had followed the advice of the rabbi of Brive, David Feuerwerker. Roger Lang was nevertheless placed under house arrest. Berthe Bouchet (Boulanger) visited the Langs in April 1942 when her daughter was about to give birth to her third child, Marianne. In 1943, Berthe was arrested in Nancy by the Gestapo for acts of propaganda and resistance. She was deported to Ravensbrück and died in the spring of 1945.

Jack Lang studied political science at the Institut d&#x27;Études Politiques de Paris, and went on to receive a postgraduate degree in public law. His career then focused on a combination of teaching and culture and the arts. He was the founder and producer of Festival du Monde in Nancy, was director of the Nancy University Theatre from 1963 to 1972, and then director of the Théâtre national de Chaillot from 1972 to 1974. At the same time he was a professor of international law from 1971 to 1981 at Nancy University and then Paris Nanterre University. He married Monique Buczynski in 1961. The couple have two daughters.

In 1997, he was President of the Jury at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival.

==Politics==
Lang entered politics as a Socialist member of the French National Assembly from Paris in 1977. He is best known for having served as Minister of Culture (22 May 1981 – 19 March 1986 and 13 May 1988 – 29 March 1993) and as Minister of Education (3 April 1992 – 29 March 1993 and 27 March 2000 – 5 May 2002).

In 1981, while Minister of Culture, he created the Fête de la Musique, a massive celebration of music held on 21 June each year, where many amateur musicians give free open-air performances. He is the co-founder and president of the Union of the Theatres of Europe.

In August 1981, he created the Lang Law, which allows publishers to enforce a minimum sale price for books.

In the 80s he contributed to the creation of the Europe Theatre Prize, born in 1986, of which he is the current President.

Lang was a Member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 1997. In 2000, he stood unsuccessfully for Mayor of Paris. While he had planned to stand for president in 2007, he ultimately decided not to register as a candidate in the Socialist primary for the sake of party unity.

In 2007, Lang agreed to become co-chairman of a commission drafting changes to the Constitution that were supported by President Nicolas Sarkozy but opposed by the Socialist Party. This decision provoked strong criticism from his party, leading him to end his role in the party leadership. When Parliament voted on the constitutional changes on 21 July 2008, he voted in favour, becoming the only Socialist deputy so to do. A three-fifths majority was required, and the changes passed by a vote of 539 to 357, meaning that Lang&#x27;s support enabled the bill to pass by a one-vote margin. The Socialist Party denounced Lang for this vote; party spokesman Julien Dray said that he had &quot;gone too far&quot; and &quot;no longer has his place in our political family&quot;, while Jean-Marc Ayrault, the President of the Socialist Parliamentary Group, said that Lang&#x27;s vote was an act of &quot;crossing the Rubicon&quot;. Lang replied by saying that it &quot;is in nobody&#x27;s power to strike me from the map of the French political landscape&quot;.

In late 2009, Sarkozy appointed Lang his special envoy to North Korea, following a similar assignment earlier in the year to Cuba. Lang travelled to Pyongyang on 9 November 2009 for a self-described &quot;listening mission&quot; aimed at exploring bilateral ties and discussing the North Korean nuclear program, among other things. Lang briefed American officials including Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg and special envoy Sung Kim, as well as ambassadors of countries involved such as Russia, before the assignment was publicly announced. Some critics questioned Lang&#x27;s qualifications, but Lang said he would be driven by his &quot;intuition&quot; that change was afoot in North Korea.

In August 2010, Lang became special adviser on piracy at the United Nations. He was brought in to advise on the prosecution of pirates off the coast of Somalia.

In 2012 Lang was chosen as the Socialist Party candidate for the National Assembly in the second district in the Vosges department. A controversial figure in the Socialist Party since his collaboration with Sarkozy, Lang&#x27;s constituency was abolished during the national reapportionment and he failed to be nominated in several other constituencies before finally succeeding in the Vosges. The electorate in this department is considered by observers to be more conservative than in Lang&#x27;s previous seat. Lang was criticized for being an &#x27;outsider&#x27;, to which he countered that he had been born in the region. Lang was narrowly defeated on the second round of voting in the election on 17 June 2012, winning 49.1% of the vote.

<text>Léon Jouhaux (1 July 1879 – 28 April 1954) was a French trade union leader who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1951.

==Biography==
Jouhaux was born in Pantin, Seine-Saint-Denis, France. Jouhaux&#x27;s father worked in a match factory in Aubervilliers. His secondary schooling ended when his father&#x27;s earnings were stopped by a strike. He gained employment at the factory at age sixteen and immediately became an important part of the union. In 1900, after serving a brief mandatory military sentence in French Algeria, Jouhaux joined a strike against the use of the white phosphorus that blinded his father, was dismissed, and worked at a succession of jobs until union influence saw him reinstated.

In 1906, he was elected by the local union as a representative to the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), where his abilities saw him quickly rise through the ranks of organized labour. By 1909 he became interim treasurer, and shortly afterwards became secretary-general of the organization, which he held until 1947. His goals as a trade unionist were the familiar ones of the early labour movement — the eight-hour day, the right to union representation and collective bargaining, and paid holidays. During the Popular Front, the 1936 Matignon Agreement, to which he was a signatory, awarded many of these rights to French workers. 

In the years before World War II, Jouhaux organised several mass protests, and the organization he led protested against the war. However, once the war started, Jouhaux supported his country and believed that a Nazi Germany victory would lead to the destruction of democracy in Europe. During the war, he was arrested and imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration camp, later moved to the Castle Itter before being freed by American and German troops in the 1945 battle there.

After the war, Jouhaux split from the CGT to form the social-democrat Workers&#x27; Force (CGT-FO). In 1951, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

In an international context, his work was instrumental in the setting up of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and was elected to high positions in international trade union bodies, including the International Federation of Trade Unions and its postwar kin the World Federation of Trade Unions until that body split.

After his death in 1954, Léon Jouhaux was interred in Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Legacy==
*The &quot;rue Léon Jouhaux&quot; in Aix-en-Provence, Grenoble, Lyon, Genas, Villefranche-sur-Saône and Paris are named for him.

==Quotation==
&quot;I would not go so far as to say that the French trade unions attached greater importance to the struggle for peace than the others did; but they certainly seemed to take it more to heart.&quot; Léon Jouhaux

<doc id="319691" wikidata="Q1282356" url="?curid=319691" title="Longquan celadon">
<text>Longquan celadon (Chinese: 龙泉青瓷) is a type of green-glazed Chinese ceramic, known in the West as celadon or greenware, produced from about 950 to 1550. The kilns were mostly in Lishui prefecture in southwestern Zhejiang Province in the south of China, and the north of Fujian Province. Overall a total of some 500 kilns have been discovered, making the Longquan celadon production area one of the largest historical ceramic producing areas in China. &quot;Longquan-type&quot; is increasingly preferred as a term, in recognition of this diversity, or simply &quot;southern celadon&quot;, as there was also a large number of kilns in north China producing Yaozhou ware or other Northern Celadon wares. These are similar in many respects, but with significant differences to Longquan-type celadon, and their production rose and declined somewhat earlier.

Celadon production had a long history at Longquan and related sites, but it was not until the Northern Song (960–1127) period that large-scale production began, and the move of the capital to Hangzhou, close to Longquan, after the start of the Southern Song (1127–1279), was probably important in the great expansion of both quality and production there. Both continued at high levels in the Yuan (1271–1368) and the early part of the Ming (1368–1644) periods. Longquan celadons were an important part of China&#x27;s export economy for over five hundred years, and were widely imitated in other countries, especially Korea and Japan. Their demise came after they were overtaken in their markets by blue and white porcelain from Jingdezhen.

In traditional Western terms, most celadons are strictly counted as stoneware, since the fired clay body is usually neither white nor translucent. In the traditional Chinese classification, which divides pottery into low-fired earthenware and high-fired porcelain, they count as porcelain. Compromise terms such as &quot;porcellanous stoneware&quot; may be used to describe the pieces, and some Western writers consider the wares should be &quot;regarded as porcelains&quot;.

The Longquan celadons were among the finest of a range of celadon wares produced in China, and led stylistic and technical developments. The celadons were produced in a range of shades of colour, centred on olive-green, but extending to greenish blues (regarded as desirable, but less common) and browns. All these colours come from the glaze; the body beneath is sometimes left partly unglazed as part of the decoration, when it fires to a terracotta brown. The wares are hardly ever painted; decoration comes from the vessel shape and carved or incised designs in the body. Shapes were originally mostly simple, allowing the glaze colour to create the main effect of a piece, but in later periods raised decoration was common.

==Technical aspects and decoration==
The body of Longquan celadon, as seen in fragments under glaze, varies from &quot;a heavy, compact grey stoneware to an almost white porcellaneous material&quot;, but where fired at the surface this turns to a typical terracotta reddish brown, seen at the unglazed foot of many pieces, and when relief decoration is left unglazed (see below and illustration). This distinguishes Longquan from Northern Celadons. However, this may not be the case in pieces made from the most whitish, porcellanous, material, where the fired body may also &quot;be translucent if thin enough&quot;. In Western sources, individual pieces are normally classified as stoneware, but some may be called porcelain; material translated from the Chinese is likely to describe all as &quot;porcelain&quot;.

The body was normally thrown on the potter&#x27;s wheel, with large vases often thrown in sections and luted together. Templates were used, and sometimes moulds, including two-part moulds, and moulds including decoration. Unglazed biscuit relief sections were achieved either by sprigging the reliefs over a glazed area before firing, where the surface would be flat in the kiln, or by adding a resist of wax or grease before glazing, when the sides of a vase were decorated.

The glaze colours vary across a wide spectrum of greyish to blueish greens, with some yellowish browns as well. The colour comes from iron oxide fired in a reducing atmosphere, and the colour varies with the temperature and the strength and timing of the reduction. Longquan celadon was fired in long dragon kilns, brick tunnels rising up a slope, with a series of chambers, and the best results came from the pots in the uppermost stages, which heated up more slowly and evenly. Saggars were always used, and the longer kilns, with up to twelve chambers, might have been able to fire as many as 25,000 pieces at a time. The firing temperature was probably between 1,180 °C and 1,280 °C, with the range over 1,250 °C giving the best green or blue colours. In some cases at least there appear to have been layers of glaze and also multiple firings to achieve a deeper glaze effect.

The glaze is made opaque by the presence of plant ash and tiny bubbles of gas, which give a lustrous effect. With the whiter body clays pieces may be translucent. The pronounced reddish colour of unglazed areas comes from the end of the firing, as the heated clay comes in contact with fresh air let into the kiln, and the iron present turns into ferrous oxide. Many pieces have crazing or crackle in the glaze, but much less than in the closely related Guan ware. A technique sometimes found before about 1400 was to add spots or splashes of a mixture rich in iron oxide with an appearance of randomness; these fired a dark brown.

Both Chinese and Japanese tradition have developed a range of terms to describe the glaze colours and qualities; some of the Japanese ones have the advantage of being anchored to specific pieces in Japan. The term &quot;kinuta&quot; (砧青瓷) meaning &quot;mallet&quot;, probably after a particular mallet vase, represents the most admired blue-green colour from the Song period, and is often used in English, while &quot;tenryūji&quot; has a &quot;a faint yellowish-green tone&quot;, and is from the Yuan and Ming. The &quot;shickikan&quot; type is from the middle Ming, after the glaze became more transparent. As with other celadons, for the Chinese the similarity of the colour to jade, always the most prestigious material in Chinese art, was an important factor in their appeal, and something the potters attempted to increase.

Most shapes are simple but very elegant. The size and decoration of larger fine pieces increases from the Yuan onwards, with some very large vases and lidded wine jars being made by the 14th century. The &quot;mallet&quot; vase was a special favourite at Longquan, often with handles formed as animals or dragons. Funerary vases, made in pairs, also often feature charmingly stylized animals, usually tigers and dragons, curled around the shoulders of the vessel. These were used in southern Chinese burial custom to store provisions for the afterlife. Another distinct Longquan style was a dish with two or more fishes in low relief swimming in the centre, either in biscuit or glazed; these sometimes have holes drilled for metal handles, as mentioned in a late 14th-century source.

In general, Longquan decoration tends to project from the body, and the effects that Northern Celadon gets from glaze pooling over shallow carving into the body are less common. Earlier pieces are content with subtle glaze effects, often accentuated by the glaze thinning over small ridges or ribs, while later pieces have more elaborate floral scrolls or animals in relief. Religious figurines and shrines were rare before the Yuan, and never a large part of production; as in Qingbai, these sometimes mix biscuit, for the flesh or figure, with a glazed background.

==Markets and later collecting==

Unlike Northern Celadon, Longquan ware does not seem to have been used by the imperial court under the Song, although Longquan kilns were used to make the &quot;official&quot; Guan ware, apparently when the Guan kilns could not cope with orders. An important market seems to have been the &quot;literati&quot; or scholar-gentleman class. As well as wares for ordinary use, they were used on altars and sometimes in burials. Many shapes, especially in the early period, were based on ancient ritual bronze shapes, which were considered appropriate to religious functions, though these lacked the complex surface decoration of the bronze originals. These were also exported in great numbers and, at least in South-East Asian countries such as Japan and Korea, these associations could also be appreciated by local &quot;literati&quot;, and indeed clergy, as many of the best survivals are in temples.

Japan was a large-scale and enthusiastic importer, and the beach at Kamakura, the capital during the height of Longquan production, had some 50,000 Longquan sherds, thought to have been broken pieces dumped at the end of the voyage from China. Japan soon began to imitate Longquan wares, and has continued to do so, both in mass-produced and studio pottery versions.

There were also large quantities exported west to the Islamic world, and one of the most important collections today is the 1,300 pieces surviving from the collection of the Ottoman Emperors, most now in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. Their worth was increased by a belief in the Middle East and Europe that the pieces would break or change colour if poison was placed on them. Fragments have also been found along the East African coast, as far south as Kenya and Tanzania.

A very few pieces reached Europe by trade or diplomatic gifts from Islamic countries, and were sometimes given elaborate metalwork mounts, turning them into goblets. Only three surviving Chinese ceramic pieces can be documented as reaching Europe before 1500. Of these, the earliest is the Fonthill Vase (now Dublin), which is qingbai porcelain, but the other two are Longquan celadon. In 1487 Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici was presented with a Longquan dish by Qaitbay, the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt. The Katzenelnbogen bowl was bought by an aristocratic German pilgrim in the Holy Land in 1433/34, who on his return had it given a cover and mounts in gilded silver (now Kassel). The Longquan Warham Bowl, traditionally given to New College, Oxford by William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury by 1532 (now loaned to the Ashmolean Museum), is perhaps a little later, from around 1500, and was given elaborate mounts in gold once in England.

==History==
In the Northern Song period the Dayao (大窯) kiln site near Longquan city alone produced wares at twenty-three separate kilns; with Jincun nearby, these appear to have been the largest kiln complexes, and produced the best wares. The era of greatest ceramic production was not until the Southern Song (1127–1279), then continuing in the Yuan (1271–1368) and Ming (1368–1644) periods.

A key event in the rise of Longquan celadon was the flight of the remaining Northern Song court to the south, after they lost control of the north in the disastrous Jin-Song wars of the 1120s. A new Southern Song court was based in Hangzhou, close to Longquan. The Northern Celadon kilns declined as Longquan greatly expanded production. Longquan wares were not from one of the Five Great Kilns later grouped by Chinese connoisseurs, and are rarely mentioned in early writing on the subject, although in the Qing dynasty careful imitations were made.

A story repeated in many sources from the Yuan onwards, with uncertain significance, tells of two brothers called Zhang, both Longquan potters, perhaps in the Southern Song, though this is unclear. The elder brother developed a very special type of ware; rightly or wrongly the later sources say this was distinguished by crackled glaze, and Ge ware (meaning &quot;elder brother ware&quot;) is supposed to be this type. The younger brother also developed a fine style of pottery, which is often taken to be the best quality early Longquan ware.

The Southern Song period saw the finest quality, and a great range of colours, as well as a great expansion of production. A count in 1988 by a Chinese archaeologist of the starts of new kilns gave 39 from the Northern Song, 61 from the Southern Song, and over 70 from the Yuan. The percentage figures for those still producing in the 20th century were 23%, &lt;10% and &lt;5%, indicating a bubble of over-production, which only the strongest kilns survived.

Quality declined during the 14th century, although initially production and exports continued to grow. By the middle of the century Jingdezhen ware was being made as blue and white porcelain, and this spectacular new ware gradually replaced Longquan celadon in many of its markets. Floods and war seem to have brought some kilns to an abrupt end; some excavated kilns lie deep under soil deposited in flooding. However, even the stoutly potted celadons of the Ming period have had their imitators at Jingdezhen and in Japan. A sunken trade vessel was found in Sinan County off the Korean coast in 1976, whose cargo included over 9,600 pieces of celadon from the Yuan period, though not of the highest quality. These were probably bound for Japan; there was a single religious statuette. Sunk in 1323, the finds made it clear that Song types had continued to be produced later than was thought.

Longquan celadon enjoyed a final period of high achievement under the early Ming dynasty, when it was an official kiln operated by and for the court. The floral decorative designs were very similar to those in contemporary Jingdezhen blue and white and also court lacquerwork, suggesting that pattern books were supplied from the centre by court artists. Shapes included large flat dishes that were very difficult to fire. By around the mid-15th century the court ceased its orders, and the decline of the kilns resumed. By the late Ming few kilns survived, and they mostly produced utilitarian wares such as tiles and water pots, as the area continues to do.

From the twentieth century native and foreign enthusiasts and scholars have visited the kiln sites and excavated there. Among modern Chinese scholars, the main kiln sites were first systematically investigated by Chen Wanli in 1928 and 1934, after the sites had been excavated by speculators and art-dealers since 1916.

<text>A gendarmerie () is a military force with law enforcement duties among the civilian population. The term gendarme () is derived from the medieval French expression &quot;&quot;, which translates to &quot;men-at-arms&quot; (). In France and some Francophone nations, the gendarmerie is a branch of the armed forces that is responsible for internal security in parts of the territory (primarily in rural areas and small towns in the case of France), with additional duties as military police for the armed forces. It was introduced to several other Western European countries during the Napoleonic conquests. In the mid-twentieth century, a number of former French mandates and colonial possessions (such as Lebanon, Syria, the Ivory Coast and the Republic of the Congo) adopted a gendarmerie after independence. 

A similar concept exists in Eastern Europe in the form of internal troops, which are present in many countries of the former Soviet Union and its former allied countries.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; is a singular extracted from Old French (), meaning &quot;men-at-arms&quot;. From the Late Middle Ages to the Early Modern period, the term referred to a heavily armoured cavalryman of noble birth, primarily serving in the French army. The word gained policing connotations only during the French Revolution, when the of the Ancien Régime was renamed to .

Historically, the spelling in English was &quot;gendarmery&quot;, but now the French spelling &quot;gendarmerie&quot; is more common. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) uses &quot;gendarmery&quot; as the principal spelling, whereas Merriam-Webster uses &quot;gendarmerie&quot; as the principal spelling.

== Title and status ==
These forces are normally titled &quot;gendarmerie&quot;, but gendarmeries may bear other titles, for instance the &quot;Carabinieri&quot; and &quot;Guardia di Finanza&quot; in Italy, the National Republican Guard in Portugal, the Civil Guard in Spain, the Royal Marechaussee in the Netherlands or Internal Troops/National Guard in Ukraine and Russia.

As a result of their duties within the civilian population, gendarmeries are sometimes described as &quot;paramilitary&quot; rather than &quot;military&quot; forces (especially in the English-speaking world where policing is rarely associated with military forces) although this description rarely corresponds to their official status and capabilities. Gendarmes are very rarely deployed in military situations, except in humanitarian deployments abroad.

A gendarmerie may come under the authority of a ministry of defence (e.g. Algeria, Netherlands and Poland), a ministry of the interior (e.g. Argentina, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine) or even both ministries at once (e.g. Chile, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain). Generally there is some coordination between ministries of defence and the interior over the use of gendarmes. In addition, some gendarmeries can be part of a civilian police force, such as the Israel Border Police or &quot;Magav&quot;, which is the gendarmerie branch of the civilian Israel Police.

A few forces which are no longer considered military retain the title &quot;gendarmerie&quot; for reasons of tradition. For instance, the French language title of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is &quot;Gendarmerie royale du Canada&quot; (GRC) (i.e., Royal Gendarmerie of Canada) because this force traditionally had some military-style functions (although separate from the Canadian Army), and have even been awarded battle honours and has retained its status as a regiment of dragoons. The Argentine National Gendarmerie is a military force in terms of training, identity and public perception, and was involved in combat in the Falklands War; however, it is classified as a &quot;security force&quot; not an &quot;armed force&quot;, to exercise jurisdiction over the civilian population under Argentine law.

Since different countries may make different use of institutional terms such as &quot;gendarmerie&quot;, there are cases in which the term may become confusing. For instance, in the French-speaking Cantons of Switzerland the &quot;gendarmeries&quot; are the uniformed civil police (see: Gendarmerie (Switzerland)). In Chile, the word &quot;gendarmerie&quot; refers for historic reasons to the prison service (the &quot;Chilean Gendarmerie&quot;), while the actual gendarmerie force is called the &quot;carabineros&quot;.

In some cases, a police service&#x27;s military links are ambiguous and it can be unclear whether a force should be defined as a gendarmerie (e.g. Mexico&#x27;s Federal Police, Brazil&#x27;s Military Police, or the former Rhodesia&#x27;s British South Africa Police until 1980). Some historical military units, such as South West Africa&#x27;s &quot;Koevoet&quot;, were only defined as police for political reasons. In Russia, the modern National Guard (successor of the Internal Troops of Russia) are military units with quasi-police duties but historically, different bodies within Imperial Russia&#x27;s Special Corps of Gendarmes performed a variety of functions as an armed rural constabulary, urban riot control units, frontier guards, intelligence agents and political police. Prior to the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, some policing was based on the Royal Irish Constabulary initially an armed force located in police barracks, it routinely disarmed after the 1880s when most civil unrest had subsided. Some consider this a gendarmerie, although this is tendentious as the subsequent Garda Síochána of the Irish Free State were also uniformly armed but not described as a gendarmerie.

In China, after numerous reorganizations and transfers of control between the PLA and the MPS, the People&#x27;s Armed Police, a gendarmerie service, was created on 19 June 1982. The establishment of the PAP highlighted the efforts to increase the professionalization of the security apparatus, as well as the absorption of numerous PLA demobilized personnel, in the wake of growing unrest.

In 2014, the Mexican Federal Police, a heavily armed force which has many attributes of a gendarmerie, created a new seventh branch of service called the National Gendarmerie Division. The new force would initially number 5,000 personnel and was created with the assistance of the French gendarmerie.

== Role and services ==

In comparison to civilian police forces, gendarmeries may provide a more disciplined force whose military capabilities (e.g., armoured group in France with armoured personnel carriers) make them more capable of dealing with armed groups and with all types of violence. On the other hand, the necessity of a more stringent selection process for military service, especially in terms of physical prowess and health, restricts the pool of potential recruits in comparison to those from which a civilian police force could select.

The growth and expansion of gendarmerie units worldwide has been linked to an increasing reluctance by some governments to use military units typically entrusted with external defence for combating internal threats. A somewhat related phenomenon has been the formation of paramilitary units which fall under the authority of civilian police agencies. Since these are not strictly military forces, however, they are not considered gendarmerie.

In France, the gendarmerie is in charge of rural areas and small towns (typically less than 10,000 inhabitants) which represent 95% of the territory and close to 50% of the population. Besides its territorial organization, it has crowd and riot control units (the &quot;Gendarmerie Mobile&quot;, along with some corresponding units in the civilian police), counter-terrorism and hostage rescue (GIGN, again along with some corresponding units in the civilian police), maritime surveillance, police at sea and coast guard (&quot;Gendarmerie maritime&quot;), control and security at airports and air traffic police (&quot;Gendarmerie des transports aériens&quot;), official buildings guard, honorary services and protection of the President (&quot;Garde Républicaine&quot;), mountain rescue (&quot;Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute Montagne&quot;) and security of nuclear weapons sites.

== French influence ==
The use of military organisations to police civilian populations is common to many time periods and cultures. Being a French concept, the French Gendarmerie has been the most influential model for such an organisation.

Many countries that were once under French rule and influence have a gendarmerie. Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria have had gendarmeries through Napoleonic influence for instance but, while Italy still has the Italian equivalent known as the Carabinieri, with a second more specialized agency called Guardia di Finanza, Belgium and Austria&#x27;s gendarmeries have merged with the civil police (in, respectively, 2001 and 2005). Many former French colonies, especially in Africa, also have gendarmeries. The Dutch Royal Marechaussee was created by King William I to replace the French Gendarmerie after French rule ended.

The national police force of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is referred to in French as the Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC). However the RCMP is a mainly civilian organisation within Public Safety Canada. It is not part of the Canadian Department of National Defence, but does have a paramilitary wing and they have been awarded the status of a regiment of dragoons, with a military battle standard displaying their battle honours following service in World War I. Those honours include Northwest Canada, South Africa, The Great War, and the Second World War.

A common gendarmerie symbol is a flaming grenade, first used as insignia by the French force.

== Role in modern conflicts ==

Gendarmes play an important role re-establishing law and order in conflict areas, a task which is suited to their purpose, training and capabilities. Gendarmeries are widely used for internal security and in peacekeeping operations, for instance in the former Yugoslavia and in Ivory Coast, sometimes via the European Gendarmerie Force.

<doc id="319693" wikidata="Q2359754" url="?curid=319693" title="Metanarrative">
<text>In social theory, a metanarrative (also master narrative, or meta-narrative and grand narrative; or ) is an overarching narrative about smaller historical narratives, which offers a society legitimation through the anticipated completion of a (as yet unrealized) master idea. The term was popularized by the writing of French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard in 1979. Metanarrative is considered a foundational concept of postmodernism.

&quot;Master narrative&quot; and synonymous terms like &quot;metanarrative&quot; are also used in narratology to mean &quot;stories within stories,&quot; as coined by literary theorist Gérard Genette.

Examples of master narratives can be found in U.S. high school textbooks according to scholar 
Derrick Alridge: &quot;history courses and curricula are dominated by such heroic and celebratory master narratives as those portraying George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as the heroic &#x27;Founding Fathers,&#x27; Abraham Lincoln as the &#x27;Great Emancipator,&#x27; and Martin Luther King, Jr., as the messianic savior of African Americans.&quot;

== Etymology ==

&quot;Meta&quot; is Greek for &quot;beyond&quot;; &quot;narrative&quot; is a story that is characterized by its telling (it is communicated somehow).

Although first used earlier in the 20th century, the term was brought into prominence by Jean-François Lyotard in 1979, with his claim that the postmodern was characterized precisely by mistrust of the &quot;grand narratives&quot; (such as ideas about Progress, Enlightenment, Emancipation, and Marxism) that had formed an essential part of modernity. Metanarrative may be related and is often used interchangeably with metafiction but there is a distinction. The latter foregrounds or discloses the fictionality of a narrative while metanarrative does not undercut fiction.

== Lyotard&#x27;s thesis ==

In &quot;The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge&quot; (1979), Lyotard highlights the increasing skepticism of the postmodern condition toward the supposed universality (&quot;totalizing nature&quot;) of metanarratives and their reliance on some form of &quot;transcendent and universal truth&quot;:

Lyotard and other poststructuralist thinkers (like Michel Foucault) view this as a broadly positive development. They assert that attempts to construct grand theories unduly dismiss the natural chaos and disorder of the universe, and the power of an individual event.

Sociology.org.uk states that it is unclear whether Lyotard&#x27;s work is describing a global condition of skepticism towards metanarratives in postmodernity, or &quot;prescribing&quot; such skepticism. Lyotard&#x27;s critics emphasize that metanarratives continue to play a major role in the postmodern world. 

=== Lyotard&#x27;s proposal ===

Lyotard proposed that metanarratives should give way to , or more modest and &quot;localized&quot; narratives, which can &quot;throw off&quot; a grand narrative by bringing into focus a singular event. Borrowing from the works of Wittgenstein and his theory of the &quot;models of discourse&quot;, Lyotard constructs his vision of a progressive politics, grounded in the cohabitation of a whole range of diverse and always locally legitimated language-games; multiple narratives coexisting. Lyotard drew from Wittgenstein&#x27;s notion of the language-game to reveal the multiplicity of meanings found within different contexts, including the meanings impact on our understanding of truth. The key concepts of Lyotard&#x27;s thesis include:

* Skepticism of Universal Truths based on the postmodernist view criticism of the single narrative that can encompass all aspects of human life and experience;
* Fragmentation of Knowledge or &quot;little narratives&quot; that are more modest, fragmented, and specified to particular contexts.

Postmodernists attempt to replace metanarratives by focusing on specific local contexts as well as on the diversity of human experience. They argue for the existence of a &quot;multiplicity of theoretical standpoints&quot; rather than for grand, all-encompassing theories.

=== Criticism of Lyotard&#x27;s thesis ===

Johannes Willem Bertens and Douwe Fokkema argued that, in so far as one of Lyotard&#x27;s targets was science, he was mistaken in thinking that science relies upon a grand narrative for social and epistemic validation, rather than on the accumulation of many lesser narrative successes.

Lyotard himself also criticized his own thesis as &quot;simply the worst of all my books.&quot;

== In narratology and communication ==

Metanarrative has a specific definition in narratology and communications theory. According to John Stephens and Robyn McCallum, a metanarrative &quot;is a global or totalizing cultural narrative schema which orders and explains knowledge and experience&quot; – a story about a story, encompassing and explaining other &quot;little stories&quot; within conceptual models that assemble the &quot;little stories&quot; into a whole. Postmodern narratives will often deliberately disturb the formulaic expectations such cultural codes provide, pointing thereby to a possible revision of the social code.

In communication and strategic communication, a master narrative (or metanarrative) is a &quot;transhistorical narrative that is deeply embedded in a particular culture&quot;. A master narrative is therefore a particular type of narrative, which is defined as a &quot;coherent system of interrelated and sequentially organized stories that share a common rhetorical desire to resolve a conflict by establishing audience expectations according to the known trajectories of its literary and rhetorical form&quot;.

The Consortium for Strategic Communication also maintains a website on master narratives.

Others have related metanarratives to masterplots, &quot;recurrent skeletal stories, belonging to cultures and individuals that play a powerful role in questions of identity, values, and the understanding of life.&quot;

<text>The Compagnies républicaines de sécurité (, &quot;Republican Security Corps&quot;), abbreviated CRS, are the general reserve of the French National Police. They are primarily involved in general security missions, but the task for which they are best known is crowd and riot control. The DCCRS has seven units: in Paris, Lille, Rennes, Bordeaux, Marseille, Lyon and Metz.

There are 60 &quot;general service&quot; CRS companies, specialized in public order and crowd control; nine &quot;motorway&quot; companies () specialized in highway patrol in urban areas; and six &quot;zonal&quot; motorcycle units (one per Defense zone.) Two additional companies and several mountain detachments administratively attached to local companies specialize in Mountain Rescue. One company (CRS n°1) specializes in VIP escort. The National Police band is also a CRS unit.

Some of the CRS officers from the &quot;general service&quot; companies are cross trained and serve as lifeguards on the beaches during the summer vacations.

The expression &quot;&quot;les CRS&quot; refers to the whole force. The feminine singular &quot;une CRS&quot; means a company (the noun &quot;compagnie&quot; is feminine), but the masculine singular &quot;un CRS&quot;&quot; is often used to mean &quot;a CRS man&quot;; the press and laypeople frequently use &quot;CRS&quot; to mean any policeman in riot gear and wearing a helmet, whether he is a true CRS or a policeman or a &quot;gendarme mobile&quot;. The form &quot;trois CRS&quot; in theory means three companies, but is often used to mean three men.

==History==
The CRS were created on 8 December 1944, after the &quot;Groupes mobiles de réserve&quot; (GMR) (created by the Vichy régime) were dissolved. The CRS are a civilian corps (unlike the gendarmes, who are military), trained in anti-insurrection and antiriot techniques. The CRS saw their first serious action during the 1947 strikes in France.

Communist sympathisers were strongly represented in the ranks of some of the early companies (due to their history of engagement in the French Resistance, and according to some - due to a desire to practice entryism). The French Communist Party (PCF) took on the role of opposition to postwar governments. On 12 November 1947, there was a demonstration in Marseilles called by the communist union CGT and the French Communist Party; some of the local CRS (a majority of whom were communists at the time), refused to act against it and several companies were dissolved as a consequence while a few more were reorganized in 1948 to remove communist influence from their ranks.

CRS detachments were created in some of the French overseas territories in 1950. The Guadeloupe and Réunion detachments were transformed into companies during the early 1960s but these were disestablished in the 1990s. Up to sixteen additional companies were created in Algeria during the Algerian War of Independence and disestablished at the end of the conflict.

CRS equipment and organization have evolved in phases. A major change in equipment followed the May 1968 demonstrations. During the 1990s, the equipment continued to evolve and the CRS were re-equipped with smaller vans to better adapt the companies to the urban environment (both in their surveillance and riot control missions).

==Missions==
The &quot;general service&quot; companies, together with the mobile gendarmerie, constitute a highly mobile reserve force for the government. Their missions include: 
* Providing security during large public events and mass gatherings such as ceremonies, sport events, festivals, concerts, and demonstrations 
* Patrolling and securing specific areas (borders, suburban areas) 
* Maintaining law and order during demonstrations, riot control
* Reinforcing local police forces in their general security missions

==Organization==

* 1 Central Directorate under a Director-general of the National Police in Paris
* 7 Zonal Directorates (one for each metropolitan military defence zone)
* 60 &quot;General Service&quot; Companies (for the maintenance of public order)
* 1 VIP Escort Compagny (CRS n° 1)
* 9 Autoroute Companies (dedicated to Highway Patrol)
* 6 Zonal Motorcycle Units
* 2 Mountain Companies (Alpes and Pyrenees) - specialized in Mountain Rescue
* The National Police Band (attached to CRS n° 1)

Some of the CRS officers are cross trained and serve as lifeguards during the summer season. They also enforce applicable laws on the beaches.

The CRS are based in barracks but, unlike the gendarmes, they live at home when not on the road. A company typically spends more than 200 days per year away from its base town.

==Company composition==

Most of the &quot;general service&quot; companies have a headquarters platoon and four line platoons () each, a few companies having a sixth platoon () or SMS equipped with special crowd/riot control equipment such as water cannons).

A complement of a regular company is as follows:
* 1 Company commander with the rank of &quot;Police Commandant&quot; (Major).
* 1 Police Captain
* 2 Police Lieutenants
* 1–4 Brigadiers-Major
* 12–25 Brigadiers-Chief
* 100–120 officers

==Criticism==
The suppressive role and occasional abuse of force by the CRS towards protesters or even school children has led to criticisms among human rights supporters. There have also been a number of complaints against CRS officers on the subject of racism and racial profiling.

&quot;CRS = SS&quot; was a famous slogan of May 68.

==Similar forces==

As French anti-riot forces, the CRS and the &quot;Gendarmerie Mobile&quot; are often mistaken for each other. The CRS are usually not deployed to the overseas French territories. The gendarmes, being part of the armed forces, can be deployed on foreign theaters. For example, gendarmerie mobile squadrons were deployed in Afghanistan, Kosovo and the Ivory Coast.

The two forces can be distinguished by uniform: uniform of the CRS is blue while that of the &quot;gendarmes mobiles&quot; is black. The CRS wear a big red CRS patch and their helmets sport yellow bands; the gendarmes have a stylized grenade on their medium-blue helmets.

In January 2009, the French state implemented a &quot;rapprochement&quot; (&quot;bringing together&quot;) of the police and the gendarmerie. This policy falls short of a complete merger, as the gendarmes have kept their military status while the CRS are a highly unionized civilian body; &quot;rapprochement&quot; has led to more commonality in terms of equipment for the two forces.

<text>Appenzell () is a municipality and village, though considered as a town by the FSO, and the capital of the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden in Switzerland. Appenzell has no municipal government of its own; rather, the different parts of Appenzell belong to and are governed by the districts Appenzell and Schwende-Rüte. Because of that, for firefighting, energy and water, the village Appenzell has a special-purpose municipality, the Feuerschaugemeinde.

== History ==
In 1071 the village was referred to as &quot;Abbacella&quot;. By 1223 this changed to &quot;Abbatiscella&quot;, meaning the Abbot&#x27;s cell. This refers to the abbot of the Abbey of Saint Gall.

The buildings in the village core, the parish church, the 1563 town hall, the &quot;Salesis&quot; house, the ruins of Castle Clanx and the state archives with the administration building are listed as heritage sites of national significance.

== Notable people ==

<text>Compulsory voting, also called universal civic duty voting or mandatory voting, is the requirement that registered voters participate in an election. As of January 2023, 21 countries have compulsory voting laws. Law enforcement in those countries varies considerably and the penalty for not casting a ballot without a proper justification ranges from severe to non-existent.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
Athenian democracy held that it was every Athenian citizen&#x27;s duty to participate in decision-making, but attendance at the assembly was voluntary. Sometimes there was some form of social to those not participating, particularly if they were engaging in other public activity at the time of the assembly. For example, Aristophanes&#x27;s comedy &quot;Acharnians&quot; 17–22, in the 5th century BC, shows public slaves herding citizens from the agora into the assembly meeting place (&quot;Pnyx&quot;) with a red-stained rope. Those with red on their clothes were fined. This usually happens if fewer than 6,000 people were in attendance, and more were needed for the assembly to continue.

In the Roman Republic, the legitimacy of the form of government known as &quot;res publica,&quot; which entrusted the powers of sovereignty to an elected aristocracy, was most evident in the Roman right to &quot;suffragium&quot;. Cicero argues that the right to vote provided Roman citizens with a certain degree of political participation, thereby guaranteeing their &quot;de facto&quot; ownership of their property, which they could administer as they wished. In practice, voting was conducted only in Rome, either in the Campus Martius or in the Forum, and not many citizens would have been able to afford the journey or take time off to vote. In addition, contrary to Greek custom, there was no economic compensation for voting. However, Cicero mentions an election that could not continue because of particularly low voter turnout, requiring a temporary draft to be implemented, though it is unclear if this was an exceptional case.

===Modern era===
From the 19th century onward a relatively small number of democracies have introduced compulsory voting at one time or another. From 1862 to 1998, compulsory voting was enacted in 20 democracies, most of which were in Western Europe or Latin America.

Belgium has the oldest extant compulsory voting system which was introduced in 1893 for men and in 1948 for women.

Compulsory voting for national elections was introduced in Australia in 1924, with states and territories passing their own compulsory voting laws at various times. Voluntary voting in Australia before 1924 accounted between 47% and 78% turnout of eligible voters. Following the introduction of compulsory federal voting in 1924 this figure increased to between 91% and 96%, with only 5% of eligible voters accounted as not enrolled.

The Netherlands and Venezuela are among several countries that have moved from compulsory to voluntary voting, in 1967 and 1993 respectively. Turnout in the Netherlands decreased from 95% to around 80%. Venezuela saw turnout drop from 82% to 61% in 1993 once compulsion was removed.

==Arguments for==

=== Capture voter preferences ===
A system with higher turnout helps make the electorate more representative and voter suppression more difficult. This major step towards the universal democratic principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; strengthens democracies and aligns the choices of its politicians with the preferences of its citizens. Since lower-turnout races are not randomized samples of an electorate (unlike a citizens&#x27; assembly), they distort the wishes and power of the electorate.

=== Civil responsibility ===
Supporters argue the democratic election of governing representatives is a citizen&#x27;s responsibility as opposed to a right. Equating in kind to similar civil responsibilities such as taxation, jury duty, compulsory education or military service, voting in these democracies is regarded as one of the &quot;duties to community&quot; mentioned in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This view asserts that, by introducing an obligation to vote, all citizens governed by a democracy partake in the responsibility for the government appointed by democratic election.

=== Improve candidate choices ===
Monash University political scientist Waleed Aly argues that whether compulsory voting favors the right or the left is beside the point, because the most beneficial aspect of compulsory voting is that it will improve the caliber of individuals who run for office and the quality of the decisions that they make. In his words, &quot;In a compulsory election, it does not pay to energize your base to the exclusion of all other voters. Since elections cannot be determined by turnout, they are decided by swing voters and won in the center... That is one reason Australia&#x27;s version of the far right lacks anything like the power of its European or American counterparts. Australia has had some bad governments, but it hasn&#x27;t had any truly extreme ones and it isn&#x27;t nearly as vulnerable to demagogues.&quot;

=== Mild penalties provide big boosts in turnout ===
Penalties only need to be modest to boost turnout and achieve the goal of attaining a much more representative electorate, especially since the public and the courts usually insist on a seamless voting process for places with mandatory voting laws.

=== Paradox of voting ===
Supporters of compulsory voting also argue that voting addresses the paradox of voting, which is that for a rational, self-interested voter, the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits. The paradox disproportionately affects the socially disadvantaged, for whom the costs of voting tend to be greater. Australian academic and supporter of compulsory voting, Lisa Hill, has argued that a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma situation arises under voluntary systems for marginalised citizens: it seems rational for them to abstain from voting, under the assumption that others in their situation are also doing so, to conserve their limited resources. However, since these are people who have a pronounced need for representation, this decision is irrational. Hill argues that the introduction of compulsory voting removes this dilemma.

=== Political legitimacy ===
The idea that compulsory voting results in a higher degree of political legitimacy is based on higher voter turnout and the more representative electorate that brings.

=== Protect against demagogues ===
High levels of participation decreases the risk of political instability created by crises or charismatic but sectionally focused demagogues.

=== Reduce income inequality ===
A 2005 Inter-American Development Bank working paper purported to show that there was a correlation between compulsory voting, when enforced strictly, and improved income distribution, as measured by the Gini coefficient and the bottom income quintiles of the population. However, a more recent Conference Board of Canada study on World income inequality – also relying on the Gini index – shows that income inequality is lowest in the Scandinavian countries, where compulsory voting has never existed, while Australia, and to a lesser extent Belgium, which strictly enforce their compulsory voting legislation, have a higher income inequality level than a number of other Western countries, such as Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, where compulsory voting does not exist.

=== Remove voting restrictions ===
Supporters of compulsory voting also argue that just as the secret ballot is designed to prevent interference with the votes actually cast, compelling voters to the polls for an election removes interference with accessing a polling place, reducing the impact that external factors such as the weather, transport, or restrictive employers might have. If everybody must vote, restrictions on voting are identified and steps are taken to remove them.

This notion is especially reinforced when both men and women are required to vote and further sustained by diligent enforcement of laws requiring registration of all eligible voters (deemed adult and without exclusion of any significant community within the population).

A growing voter preference towards pre-polling such as vote by mail can make participation easier, where the voter can fulfil their obligation more at their own convenience prior to polling day, rather than trying to arrange release from their responsibilities on the nominated date of polling.

=== Stimulate political interest and education ===
Other perceived advantages to compulsory voting are the stimulation of broader interest politics, as a sort of civil education and political stimulation, which creates a better informed population. For example, since far fewer campaign funds are needed to convince people to vote, they can be directed towards discussing proposed policies with a wider range of voters. Australian senator Herbert Payne, whose 1924 private member&#x27;s bill introduced compulsory voting in Australia, believed compulsory voting was necessary to counteract &quot;apathy and indolence&quot; among voters and would bring &quot;a wonderful improvement in the political knowledge of the people&quot;.

==Arguments against==

=== Regressive taxation ===
Concerns about fines landing harder on the poorest citizens can lead to reforms to ensure penalties are mild for the poorest citizens and that voting is accessible and seamless for all to help assure concerned voters that mandatory voting will not become a regressive tax. The impact of these fines can be mitigated by making sure they do not compound over time, are weighted based on income, and by providing an option to perform community service in lieu of payment.

=== Compelled speech ===
Another concern expressed about compulsory voting is that it would compel speech, which violates freedom of speech which includes the freedom &quot;not&quot; to speak. Former Australian opposition leader Mark Latham urged Australians to lodge blank votes for the 2010 election. He stated the government should not force citizens to vote or threaten them with a fine. At the 2013 federal election, considering the threat of a non-voting fine of up to A$20, there was a turnout of 92%, of whom 6% lodged either informal or blank ballot papers. Systems in democratic countries, which have a secret ballot, allow for blank ballots, but voting systems could also add a &#x27;none of the above&#x27; option to each race so as to provide multiple clear ways for voters to refrain from speaking/voting if, for some reason, a voter does not want to submit a partially or fully blank ballot.

=== Religious objections ===
Religious objection is one that many Christadelphians and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, for example, cite as for why they should not participate in political events. As a result, many countries allow religious beliefs as a valid excuse for not going to the polls.

=== Civil liberties ===
Libertarians in particular debate to what extent voting is a civic duty and not just a civic right. Even in the case of the US where most Americans do see voting as a civic duty, most Americans in a 2020 poll did not like the idea of imposing a US$20 fine on those who did not cite an excuse for not voting including a conscientious objection.

=== Vote buying ===
One perceived downside to compulsory voting is that by coercing politically apathetic people to vote in elections, they are vulnerable to manipulation through vote buying.

== Impact ==
A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referendums by up to 20 percentage points. Another study found that the effects of universal turnout in the United States would likely be small in national elections, but that universal turnout could matter in close elections, such as the presidential elections of 2000 and 2004. In the United States, Democrats would most likely fare better under universal voting (as nonvoters are generally more Democratic) but due to the rarity of close elections in the United States, universal voting would change &quot;very few election outcomes.&quot; Research on compulsory voting in Australia found that it increased the vote shares and seat shares of the Australian Labor Party by 7 to 10 percentage points and led to greater pension spending at the national level. While weakly enforced compulsory voting in Austria increased overall turnout by roughly 10 percentage points, there is &quot;no evidence that this change in turnout affected government spending patterns (in levels or composition) or electoral outcomes.&quot; A 2016 study finds that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement in several ways. A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of &quot;minor and extreme parties.&quot; Research suggests that higher rates of voter turnout lead to higher top tax rates.

A 2024 study found that compulsory voting can reduce political polarization and push political parties towards the preferences of the median voter by eliminating the ability of extremist partisans to threaten to abstain from voting (which pressures parties to adopt policies to appease those voters).

== Public opinion ==
According to a 1997 paper by Malcolm Mackerras and Ian McAllister, in Australia &quot;polls taken over the years have consistently shown a community support of between 60 and 70 per cent&quot; for compulsory voting. In 2005, polls taken by Roy Morgan Research and Ipsos-Mackay found 71 and 74 percent support respectively. Both polls also found there was roughly equal support for compulsory voting among supporters of Australia&#x27;s major political groups, the Liberal–National Coalition and the Australian Labor Party.

In Belgium, which has had compulsory voting since 1893, support for the abolition of compulsory voting is in progression. Results from a 2016 public opinion poll showed that 49% of respondents were in favor of abolition (46% in Wallonia, 49% in Brussels, 51% in Flanders) with 10% having no opinion.

==Current and past use by countries==
, 21 countries were recorded as having compulsory voting. Of these, only 10 countries (additionally one Swiss canton) enforce it. As of January 2020, of the 36 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), only Australia had forms of compulsory voting which were enforced in practice. Voting in Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg, Mexico and Turkey is compulsory, but is not enforced.
===Repealed===
Countries where voting is no longer compulsory:
==Measures to encourage voting==
Although voting in a country may be compulsory, penalties for failing to vote are not always strictly enforced. In Australia and Brazil, providing a legitimate reason for not voting (such as illness) is accepted. In Australia, if a citizen is asked why they did not vote and they reply that it is against their religion, the Electoral Act provides that this answer must be taken as conclusive, and no further action is to be taken. In Argentina, those who were ill on voting day are excused by requesting a doctor to prove their condition; those over away from their voting place are also excused by asking for a certificate at a police station near where they are. Belgian voters can vote in an embassy if they are abroad or can empower another voter to cast the vote in their name; the voter must give a &quot;permission to vote&quot; and carry a copy of the ID card and their own on the actual elections.

States that sanction nonvoters with fines generally impose small or nominal penalties. This can be seen as reflecting the practical rationale for compulsory voting – that compulsion is aimed at making it more irksome not to vote than to vote, and therefore mild penalties are all that is required. However, penalties for failing to vote are not limited to fines and legal sanctions. Belgian voters who repeatedly fail to vote in elections may be subject to disenfranchisement. Singaporean voters who fail to vote in a general election or presidential election will be subjected to disenfranchisement until a valid reason is given or a fine is paid. Goods and services provided by public offices may be denied to those failing to vote in Peru and Greece. In Brazil, people who fail to vote in an election are barred from obtaining a passport and subject to other restrictions until settling their situation before an electoral court or after they have voted in the two most recent elections. If a Bolivian voter fails to participate in an election, the person may be denied withdrawal of the salary from the bank for three months.

A postal vote may be available for those for whom it is difficult to attend a polling station. Pre-poll voting at nominated polling stations in Australia has been increasing in recent years.

<text>Rüte District was a district in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden in Switzerland.

==History==
Rüte is first mentioned around 1420-21 as &quot;Rütiner rod&quot;.

On 1 May 2022, the former districts of Rüte and Schwende merged to form the new district of Schwende-Rüte.

==Name==
The name &quot;Rüte&quot; goes back to &quot;Reuten&quot;, which refers to the German word &quot;roden&quot; (wood clearing). The name originally comes from one of the two hamlets called &quot;Rüti&quot;.

<doc id="319708" wikidata="Q180936" url="?curid=319708" title="Saint Gall">
<text>Gall (; 550 645) according to hagiographic tradition was a disciple and one of the traditional twelve companions of Columbanus on his mission from Ireland to the continent. However, he may have originally come from the border region between Lorraine and Alemannia and only met Columbanus at the monastery of Luxeuil in the Vosges. Gall is known as a representative of the Irish monastic tradition. The Abbey of Saint Gall in the city of Saint Gallen, Switzerland was built upon his original hermitage. Deicolus was the elder brother of Gall.

==Biography==

The fragmentary oldest &quot;Life&quot; was recast in the 9th century by two monks of Reichenau, enlarged in 816–824 by Wettinus, and about 833–884 by Walafrid Strabo, who also revised a book of the miracles of the saint. Other works ascribed to Walafrid tell of Saint Gall in prose and verse.

Gall&#x27;s origin is a matter of dispute. According to his 9th-century biographers in Reichenau, he was from Ireland and entered Europe as a companion of Columbanus. The Irish origin of the historical Gallus was called into question by Hilty (2001), who proposed it as more likely that he was from the Vosges or Alsace region. Schär (2010) proposed that Gall may have been of Irish descent but born and raised in the Alsace.

According to the 9th-century hagiographies, Gall as a young man went to study under Comgall of Bangor Abbey. The monastery at Bangor had become renowned throughout Europe as a great centre of Christian learning. Studying in Bangor at the same time as Gall was Columbanus, who with twelve companions, set out about the year 589.

Gall and his companions established themselves with Columbanus at first at Luxeuil in Gaul. In 610, Columbanus was exiled by leaders opposed to Christianity and fled with Gall to Alemannia. He accompanied Columbanus on his voyage up the Rhine River to Bregenz but when in 612 Columbanus travelled on to Italy from Bregenz, Gall had to remain behind due to illness and was nursed at Arbon. He remained in Alemannia, where, with several companions, he led the life of a hermit in the forests southwest of Lake Constance, near the source of the river Steinach. Cells were soon added for twelve monks whom Gall carefully instructed. Gall was soon known in Switzerland as a powerful preacher.

When the See of Constance became vacant, the clergy who assembled to elect a new bishop were unanimously in favour of Gall. He, however, refused, pleading that the election of a stranger would be contrary to church law. Some time later, in the year 625, on the death of Eustasius, abbott of Luxeuil, a monastery founded by Columbanus, members of that community were sent by the monks to request Gall to undertake the government of the monastery. He refused to quit his life of solitude, and undertake any office of rank which might involve him in the cares of the world. He was then an old man.

He died at the age of ninety-five around 645–650 in Arbon.
==Legends==
From as early as the 9th century a series of fantastically embroidered &quot;Lives&quot; of Saint Gall were circulated. Prominent was the story in which Gall delivered Fridiburga from the demon by which she was possessed. Fridiburga was the betrothed of Sigebert II, King of the Franks, who had granted an estate at Arbon (which belonged to the royal treasury) to Gall so that he might found a monastery there.

Another popular story has it that as Gall was travelling in the woods of what is now Switzerland he was sitting one evening warming his hands at a fire. A bear emerged from the woods and charged. The holy man rebuked the bear, so awed by his presence it stopped its attack and slunk off to the trees. There it gathered firewood before returning to share the heat of the fire with Gall. The legend says that for the rest of his days Gall was followed around by his companion the bear.

==Veneration==
His feast is celebrated on 16 October.

==Iconography==
Images of Saint Gall typically represent him standing with a bear.

==Legacy==
When Columbanus, Gall and their companions left Ireland for mainland Europe, they took with them learning and the written word.
Their effect on the historical record was significant as the books were painstakingly reproduced on vellum by monks across Europe. Many of the Irish texts destroyed in Ireland during Viking raids were preserved in Abbeys across the channel.

===Abbey of St. Gall===
For several decades after his death, Gall&#x27;s hermit cell remained; his disciples remained together in the cell he had built and followed the rule of St. Columban, combining prayer with work of the hands and reading with teaching. In 719, St. Otmar, the brotherhood&#x27;s first abbot, extended Gall&#x27;s cell into the Abbey of St. Gall, which became the nucleus of the Canton of St. Gallen in eastern Switzerland. The abbey followed the rule of St. Benedict of Nursia beginning in 747. As many as 53 monks joined the order under St. Otmar and the community grew to acquire land in Thurgau, the region of Zurich and Alemannia, up to the River Neckar. In the second half of the 8th century, the community continued to grow but became legally dependent on the Bishop of Constance. After an extended conflict with the see of Constance, the Abbey of St. Gallen regained its independence in the 9th century when Emperor Louis the Pious made it a royal monastery. The Abbey&#x27;s monastery and especially its celebrated scriptorium (evidenced from 760 onwards) played an illustrious part in Catholic and intellectual history until it was secularised in 1798. It is very likely that Gall kept a small library of books for himself and his disciples for their liturgical worship. Following his death and the establishment of his tomb, the brotherhood of priests gathered there likely added to this small collection of books. These books would become the basis for the Abbey Library of Saint Gall.

===Church of St. Havel===
In Bohemian lands (modern day Czech Republic), Gall was known as St. Havel. Wenceslas I built a church in his honor in Prague shortly after his coronation in 1230, as well as the area of &quot;Havel Town&quot; around it.

==In popular culture==
&quot;St Gall&quot; is the name of a wheel shaped hard cheese made from the milk of Friesian cows, which won a Gold Medal at the World Cheese Awards held in Dublin 2008.

Robertson Davies, in his book, &quot;The Manticore&quot;, interprets the legend in Jungian psychological terms. In the final scene of the novel where David Staunton is celebrating Christmas with Lizelloti Fitziputli, Magnus Eisengrim, and Dunstan Ramsay he is given a gingerbread bear. Ramsay explains that Gall made a pact of peace with a bear who was terrorizing the citizens of the nearby village. They would feed him gingerbread and he would refrain from eating them. The parable is presented as a Jungian exhortation to make peace with one&#x27;s dark side. This Jungian interpretation is however incompatible with Catholic Orthodoxy which Gall promoted.

<text>Schlatt-Haslen District is a district of the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden in Switzerland. It was formally established in 1872 from the rhode Schlatt and the village Haslen.

==Name==
&quot;Slatte&quot; either refers to &quot;hollow&quot; or &quot;slope&quot;, to the local dialect word &quot;schlatt&quot; which means &quot;hitting&quot;. The name of the village &quot;Haslen&quot; goes back to &quot;Haslowe&quot; which means a pasture with hazelnut trees.

==History==
Schlatt is first mentioned in 1200 as &quot;Slatte&quot;. In the 13th century, Haslen was mentioned as &quot;Haslowe&quot;.

==Geography==
Schlatt-Haslen has an area, , of . Of this area, 64.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while 30.4% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 4.3% is settled (buildings or roads) and 0.6% is unproductive land.

The district runs between the Hundwiler Höhe and Rotbach mountains. It consists of the village of Haslen and the hamlets of Schlatt and Enggenhütten and numerous individual farm houses. Since 1877 the nunnery at Wonnenstein, near Teufen, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, has been an exclave of the distinct.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Or a Halberd Argent handled of the first on a Bend Gules.&quot;

The coat of arms shows a silver halberd with a golden handle. The halberd is placed on a red diagonal beam, itself placed on a golden background. It is not clear why this hitting weapon is included in the coat of arms, but the name of the village is thought to go back to the word &quot;hitting&quot;.

==Demographics==
Schlatt-Haslen has a population () of . , 3.2% of the population are resident foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1999–2009 ) the population has changed at a rate of -6.3%. It has changed at a rate of -5.2% due to migration and at a rate of -0.2% due to births and deaths.

Most of the population () speaks German (1,115 or 97.3%), with Albanian being second most common (13 or 1.1%) and Turkish being third (6 or 0.5%). There are 5 people who speak French.

Of the population in the district 719 or about 62.7% were born in Schlatt-Haslen and lived there in 2000. There were 113 or 9.9% who were born in the same canton, while 250 or 21.8% were born somewhere else in Switzerland, and 49 or 4.3% were born outside of Switzerland.

In there were no live births to or deaths of Swiss citizens. Ignoring immigration and emigration, the population of Swiss citizens remained the same while the foreign population remained the same. There was 1 Swiss man who emigrated from Switzerland and 4 Swiss women who immigrated back to Switzerland. At the same time, there was 1 non-Swiss man and 2 non-Swiss women who immigrated from another country to Switzerland. The total Swiss population change in 2008 (from all sources, including moves across municipal borders) was a decrease of 1 and the non-Swiss population increased by 6 people. This represents a population growth rate of 0.4%.

, there were 607 people who were single and never married in the district. There were 483 married individuals, 42 widows or widowers and 14 individuals who are divorced.

 the average number of residents per living room was 0.66 which is more people per room than the cantonal average of 0.59 per room. In this case, a room is defined as space of a housing unit of at least as normal bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens and habitable cellars and attics. About 70.3% of the total households were owner occupied, or in other words did not pay rent (though they may have a mortgage or a rent-to-own agreement).

, there were 356 private households in the district, and an average of 3.2 persons per household. There were 77 households that consist of only one person and 98 households with five or more people. Out of a total of 360 households that answered this question, 21.4% were households made up of just one person and there were 10 adults who lived with their parents. Of the rest of the households, there are 68 married couples without children, 178 married couples with children There were 9 single parents with a child or children. There were 14 households that were made up of unrelated people and 4 households that were made up of some sort of institution or another collective housing.

 there were 116 single family homes (or 32.7% of the total) out of a total of 355 inhabited buildings. There were 23 multi-family buildings (6.5%), along with 196 multi-purpose buildings that were mostly used for housing (55.2%) and 20 other use buildings (commercial or industrial) that also had some housing (5.6%). Of the single family homes 53 were built before 1919, while 8 were built between 1990 and 2000.

 there were 407 apartments in the district. The most common apartment size was 4 rooms of which there were 111. There were 8 single room apartments and 215 apartments with five or more rooms. Of these apartments, a total of 344 apartments (84.5% of the total) were permanently occupied, while 50 apartments (12.3%) were seasonally occupied and 13 apartments (3.2%) were empty. , the construction rate of new housing units was 2.6 new units per 1000 residents. The vacancy rate for the district, , was 2.04%.

<doc id="319712" wikidata="Q338021" url="?curid=319712" title="Well-founded relation">
<text>In mathematics, a binary relation is called well-founded (or wellfounded or foundational) on a set or, more generally, a class if every non-empty subset has a minimal element with respect to ; that is, there exists an such that, for every , one does not have . In other words, a relation is well-founded if:
formula_1
Some authors include an extra condition that is set-like, i.e., that the elements less than any given element form a set.

Equivalently, assuming the axiom of dependent choice, a relation is well-founded when it contains no infinite descending chains, which can be proved when there is no infinite sequence of elements of such that for every natural number .

In order theory, a partial order is called well-founded if the corresponding strict order is a well-founded relation. If the order is a total order then it is called a well-order.

In set theory, a set is called a well-founded set if the set membership relation is well-founded on the transitive closure of . The axiom of regularity, which is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, asserts that all sets are well-founded.

A relation is converse well-founded, upwards well-founded or Noetherian on , if the converse relation is well-founded on . In this case is also said to satisfy the ascending chain condition. In the context of rewriting systems, a Noetherian relation is also called terminating.

==Induction and recursion==

An important reason that well-founded relations are interesting is because a version of transfinite induction can be used on them: if () is a well-founded relation, is some property of elements of , and we want to show that

: holds for all elements of ,

it suffices to show that:

: If is an element of and is true for all such that , then must also be true.

That is,
formula_2

Well-founded induction is sometimes called Noetherian induction, after Emmy Noether.

On par with induction, well-founded relations also support construction of objects by transfinite recursion. Let be a set-like well-founded relation and a function that assigns an object to each pair of an element and a function on the initial segment of . Then there is a unique function such that for every ,
formula_3

That is, if we want to construct a function on , we may define using the values of for .

As an example, consider the well-founded relation , where is the set of all natural numbers, and is the graph of the successor function . Then induction on is the usual mathematical induction, and recursion on gives primitive recursion. If we consider the order relation , we obtain complete induction, and course-of-values recursion. The statement that is well-founded is also known as the well-ordering principle.

There are other interesting special cases of well-founded induction. When the well-founded relation is the usual ordering on the class of all ordinal numbers, the technique is called transfinite induction. When the well-founded set is a set of recursively-defined data structures, the technique is called structural induction. When the well-founded relation is set membership on the universal class, the technique is known as ∈-induction. See those articles for more details.

==Examples==

Well-founded relations that are not totally ordered include:
* The positive integers , with the order defined by if and only if divides and .
* The set of all finite strings over a fixed alphabet, with the order defined by if and only if is a proper substring of .
* The set of pairs of natural numbers, ordered by if and only if and .
* Every class whose elements are sets, with the relation ∈ (&quot;is an element of&quot;). This is the axiom of regularity.
* The nodes of any finite directed acyclic graph, with the relation defined such that if and only if there is an edge from to .
Examples of relations that are not well-founded include:
* The negative integers , with the usual order, since any unbounded subset has no least element.
* The set of strings over a finite alphabet with more than one element, under the usual (lexicographic) order, since the sequence is an infinite descending chain. This relation fails to be well-founded even though the entire set has a minimum element, namely the empty string.
* The set of non-negative rational numbers (or reals) under the standard ordering, since, for example, the subset of positive rationals (or reals) lacks a minimum.

==Other properties==

If is a well-founded relation and is an element of , then the descending chains starting at are all finite, but this does not mean that their lengths are necessarily bounded. Consider the following example: 
Let be the union of the positive integers with a new element ω that is bigger than any integer. Then is a well-founded set, but
there are descending chains starting at ω of arbitrary great (finite) length; 
the chain has length for any .

The Mostowski collapse lemma implies that set membership is a universal among the extensional well-founded relations: for any set-like well-founded relation on a class that is extensional, there exists a class such that is isomorphic to .

==Reflexivity==

A relation is said to be reflexive if holds for every in the domain of the relation. Every reflexive relation on a nonempty domain has infinite descending chains, because any constant sequence is a descending chain. For example, in the natural numbers with their usual order ≤, we have . To avoid these trivial descending sequences, when working with a partial order ≤, it is common to apply the definition of well foundedness (perhaps implicitly) to the alternate relation &lt; defined such that if and only if and . More generally, when working with a preorder ≤, it is common to use the relation &lt; defined such that if and only if and . In the context of the natural numbers, this means that the relation &lt;, which is well-founded, is used instead of the relation ≤, which is not. In some texts, the definition of a well-founded relation is changed from the definition above to include these conventions.

<text>A common year starting on Wednesday is any non-leap year (a year with 365 days) that begins on Wednesday, 1 January, and ends on Wednesday, 31 December. Its dominical letter hence is E. The current year, [[2025]], is a common year starting on Wednesday in the Gregorian calendar, and the next such year will be 2031, or, likewise, 2015 and 2026 in the obsolete Julian calendar, see below for more. This common year is one of the three possible common years in which a century year can begin on, and occurs in century years that yield a remainder of 200 when divided by 400. The most recent such year was 1800, and the next one will be 2200.

Any common year that starts on Wednesday has only one Friday the 13th: the only one in this common year occurs in June. Leap years starting on Tuesday share this characteristic.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian Calendar ===
In the (currently used) Gregorian calendar, alongside Sunday, Monday, Friday or Saturday, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 400-year cycle (20871 weeks). Forty-three common years per cycle or exactly 10.75% start on a Wednesday. The 28-year sub-cycle only spans across century years divisible by 400, e.g. 1600, 2000, and 2400.

=== Julian Calendar ===
In the now-obsolete Julian calendar, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 28-year cycle (1461 weeks). A leap year has two adjoining dominical letters (one for January and February and the other for March to December, as 29 February has no letter). This sequence occurs exactly once within a cycle, and every common letter thrice.

As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1). Years 2, 8 and 19 of the cycle are common years beginning on Wednesday. 2017 is year 10 of the cycle. Approximately 10.71% of all years are common years beginning on Wednesday.

<doc id="319727" wikidata="Q217034" url="?curid=319727" title="Leap year starting on Tuesday">
<text>A leap year starting on Tuesday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Tuesday, 1 January, and ends on Wednesday, 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are FE. The most recent year of such kind was 2008, and the next one will be 2036 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise 2020 and 2048 in the obsolete Julian calendar.

Any leap year that starts on Tuesday has only one Friday the 13th; the only one in this leap year occurs in June. Common years starting on Wednesday share this characteristic.

Any leap year that starts on Tuesday has only one Tuesday the 13th: the only one in this leap year occurs in May.

Any leap year that starts on Tuesday has only one Friday the 17th: the only one in this leap year occurs in October.

From August of the common year preceding that year until October in this type of year is also the longest period (14 months) that occurs without a Friday the 17th.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian Calendar ===
Leap years that begin on Tuesday, along with those starting on Wednesday, occur at a rate of approximately 14.43% (14 out of 97) of all total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Thus, their overall occurrence is 3.5% (14 out of 400).

=== Julian Calendar ===
Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Tuesday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e. in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1).

== History==

===1875 to January 1993===
In 1875, the &quot;Continental Oil and Transportation Company&quot; (acronym &quot;Conoco&quot;) was founded in Ogden, Utah by Isaac Blake. In 1885, Conoco was reincorporated as part of Standard Oil. After the Supreme Court of the United States dissolved Standard Oil, Conoco became independent in 1913.

By 1929, it had become a fully integrated oil company. The company was a coal, oil, kerosene, grease and candles distributor in the West.

In 1929, Conoco merged with the Marland Oil Company.

Marland Oil Company, founded by exploration pioneer E. W. Marland, later acquired the assets of Continental Oil Co.. On June 26, 1899, Marland Oil changed its name to Continental Oil Co. and moved its headquarters to Fargo, North Dakota. The acquisition gave Conoco the red bar-and-triangle logo previously used by Marland. Conoco used the logo between 1930 and 1970, when the current red capsule logo was adopted. Conoco was based in Ponca City until 1949, when it moved to Houston, Texas.

===1998===

In 1998, Conoco acquired an interest in 10.5 blocks in the Kashagan Field in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan through the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA).

==Environmental record==
On April 11, 2007, ConocoPhillips became the first U.S. oil company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, an alliance of big business and environmental groups. In January 2007, the partnership advised President George W. Bush that mandatory emissions caps would be needed to reduce the flow of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In 2007, ConocoPhillips announced it would spend $150 million that year on alternative and unconventional energy sources, up from $80 million in 2006. However, ConocoPhillips left the U.S. Climate Action Partnership in February 2010, at the same time as BP and Caterpillar Inc. left the partnership.

ConocoPhillips is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. In 2016, ConocoPhillips was ranked as being among the 12th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights in the Arctic. In May 2020, it was reported that the company was planning new drillings in Alaska&#x27;s North Slope which would affect the life of 400 in the Native Village of Nuiqsut. According to the 2021 Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI), ConocoPhillips is ranked as the fourth most environmentally responsible company out of 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle.

The civil complaint, filed in January 2013, alleged that the companies violated state laws on the operation and maintenance of underground gasoline storage tanks at more than 560 gas stations in the state. These violations included failing to properly maintain leak detection devices, testing secondary containment systems, conducting monthly inspections and training employees in proper protocol.

<text>CalculiX is a free and open-source finite-element analysis application that uses an input format similar to Abaqus. It has an implicit and explicit solver (CCX) written by Guido Dhondt and a pre- and post-processor (CGX) written by Klaus Wittig. The original software was written for the Linux operating system. Convergent Mechanical has ported the application to the Windows operating system.

The pre-processor component of CalculiX can generate grid data for the computational fluid dynamics programs duns, ISAAC and OpenFOAM. It can also generate input data for the commercial FEM programs Nastran, Ansys and Abaqus. The pre-processor can also generate mesh data from STL files.
There is an active online community that provides support at Discourse. Convergent Mechanical also provides installation support for their extended version of CalculiX for Windows.

There is a friendly CalculiX Launcher with CCX wizard for both Windows and Linux.
Also possible is the Installation in Windows 10 Fall Creator (1709) with the new Linux Subsystem WSL.

A Python library, pycalculix, was written to automate the creation of CalculiX models in the Python programming language. The library provides Python access to building, loading, meshing, solving, and querying CalculiX results for 2D models. Pycalculix was written by Justin Black. Examples and tutorials are available on the pycalculix site.

FreeCAD has developed a FEM workbench that automates the creation of CalculiX models.

There is a lot good examples of use of CalculiX by Prof. Martin Kraska, Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences.

Official repository at Github is https://github.com/Dhondtguido/CalculiX.

<doc id="319739" wikidata="Q372581" url="?curid=319739" title="Lovejoy">
<text>Lovejoy is a British television comedy-drama mystery series, based on the novels by John Grant under the pen name Jonathan Gash. The show, which ran to 71 episodes over six series, was originally broadcast on BBC1 between 10 January 1986 and 4 December 1994, though there was a five-year gap between the first and second series. It was adapted for television by Ian La Frenais.

==Overview==
The series concerns the adventures of the eponymous Lovejoy, a roguish antiques dealer based in East Anglia, and was filmed around Long Melford. Within the trade, he has a reputation as a &quot;divvy&quot;, a person with almost unnatural powers of recognising exceptional items as well as distinguishing genuine antiques from fakes or forgeries.

==Characters==
* Lovejoy, played by Ian McShane, a less than scrupulous yet likeable rogue antique dealer 
* Eric Catchpole, played by Chris Jury (series 1–5; guest, series 6), Lovejoy&#x27;s younger, enthusiastic, but ever so slightly dim, assistant

==Broadcast history==
The series was notable for its style and pace. Lovejoy would frequently break the fourth wall, revealing his thoughts and motives by addressing the audience directly. The first series was shown on BBC1 in the first half of 1986. It concluded with a two-part special.

Despite the first series being a moderate ratings success, &quot;Lovejoy&quot; was not brought back until January 1991. The original four cast members returned for the next two series between 1991 and 1992. With the start of the fourth series in 1993, Malcolm Tierney reprised his first series role as Charlie Gimbert.

During the fifth series, several cast changes were made. Phyllis Logan left the show in the second episode and Chris Jury departed in the sixth episode, although both characters returned for the sixth series finale. Two new regular characters were added: Lovejoy&#x27;s new apprentice, Beth Taylor, and Charlotte Cavendish, who ran a local antiques auction house.

The sixth and final series of ten episodes was broadcast between October and December 1994. Two ninety-minute &quot;Lovejoy&quot; specials for Christmas were shown in 1992 and 1993. The theme tune used in the opening and end credits, as well as the incidental music for each episode, was composed by Denis King.

==Releases==
In the United States, the series was first broadcast on the A&amp;E Network. It was marketed as &quot;The Lovejoy Mysteries&quot; on VHS in the United States. The DVD release of the entire series has returned to the title of &quot;Lovejoy&quot;.
