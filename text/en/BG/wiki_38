<text>Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev (born 7 July 1947) is the former and last reigning King of Nepal, reigning from 2001 to 2008, when the monarchy was ended. As a child, he was briefly king from 1950 to 1951, when his grandfather, Tribhuvan, took political exile in India with the rest of his family. His second reign, which began after the 2001 Nepalese royal massacre, was marked by constitutional turmoil.

His brother King Birendra had established a constitutional monarchy in which he delegated policy to a representative government. The growing insurgency of the Nepalese Civil War during Gyanendra&#x27;s reign interfered with the elections of representatives. After several delays in elections, Gyanendra suspended the constitution and assumed direct authority in February 2005, asserting that it would be a temporary measure to suppress the Maoist insurgency after civil governments had failed to do so. In the face of broad opposition, he restored the previous parliament in April 2006. He was deposed two years later by the first session of the Constituent Assembly, which declared the nation to be the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal and abolished the 240-year-old Shah dynasty.

== Early life and first reign ==

Gyanendra was born on 7 July 1947 in the old Narayanhiti Royal Palace in Kathmandu, as the second son of Crown Prince Mahendra and his first wife, Crown Princess Indra. After his birth, his father was told by a court astrologer not to look at his newborn son because it would bring him bad luck, so Gyanendra was sent to live with his grandmother.

In November 1950, during a political plot, both his father and his grandfather King Tribhuvan, along with other royals, fled to India, leaving the infant Prince Gyanendra as the only male member of the royal family in Nepal. He was brought back to the capital Kathmandu by Prime Minister Mohan Shamsher, who had him declared king on 7 November 1950. Not only was Gyanendra crowned, but coins were issued in his name. The Rana prime minister provided a 300,000 rupee annual budget as expenditure for the king. After opposition to the hereditary rule of the Rana prime ministers from India, a deal was reached in January 1951, and Gyanendra&#x27;s grandfather King Tribhuvan returned to Nepal and resumed the throne. The actions of the Rana regime to depose his grandfather and place Gyanendra on the throne were internationally not recognized.

Gyanendra studied with his elder brother King Birendra at St. Joseph&#x27;s School, Darjeeling, India; in 1969, he graduated from Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu. He served as the chairman of the Advisory Committee for the Coronation of his brother King Birendra in 1975. He is a keen conservationist and served as chairman of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (later known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation) from 1982 until his reaccession to the throne in 2001.

Gyanendra married his second cousin Komal Rajya Lakhsmi Devi on 1 May 1970 in Kathmandu. They have two children:
*Prince Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev (born on 30 December 1971).
*Princess Prerana Rajya Lakshmi Devi Singh (born on 20 February 1978).

==Succession==
Gyanendra again assumed the throne after many other royal family members, including King Birendra, were assassinated on 1 June 2001 by Gyanendra&#x27;s nephew Crown Prince Dipendra, who was titular king for a brief period before succumbing to a self-inflicted gunshot wound. These events and the ensuing investigation proved very controversial. A two-man investigation team appointed by Gyanendra and made up of Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, then-Supreme Court Chief Justice, and Taranath Ranabhat, then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, carried out a week-long investigation. After interviewing more than 100 people—including eyewitnesses, palace officials, guards, and staff—they concluded that Dipendra had indeed carried out the massacre, but they drew no further conclusions. As his nephew lay in a coma, Prince Gyanendra was named regent; but after King Dipendra&#x27;s death on 4 June 2001, Gyanendra resumed the throne.

== Second reign ==

===Early reign===
During his early years on the throne, Gyanendra sought to exercise full control over the government, citing the failure of all the political parties to hold an election after the parliament was dissolved. In May 2002, he supported the popularly elected Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba when he dismissed the parliament elected in 1999. In October 2002, he dismissed Deuba and consolidated his power for the first time. During the years 2002 to 2005 he chose and subsequently dismissed three prime ministers for failure to hold elections and bring the rebels to a round table negotiation; he finally dismissed Deuba for the second time and took over as absolute ruler on 1 February 2005, promising that the country would return to normality within 36 months.
His elder brother King Birendra had negotiated a constitutional monarchy during his rule in a delicate manner in which he, as king, played a minor role in government. Thus, Gyanendra&#x27;s confrontational approach with the established political parties met with widespread censure.

When Gyanendra took complete control for the second time, on 1 February 2005, he dismissed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba&#x27;s government for failing to make arrangements for parliamentary elections and being unable to restore peace in the country, which was then in the midst of a civil war led by Maoist insurgents.

Gyanendra promised that &quot;peace and effective democracy&quot; would be restored within three years.
but the period of direct rule was accompanied by repression of dissent. International organizations expressed grave concerns about the safety of journalists, following the king&#x27;s decision to restrict civil liberties, including freedom of the press, the constitutional protection against censorship and the right against preventive detention.

In April 2006, the seven-party alliance and the then banned CPN Maoist party in an underground manner staged protests and strikes in Kathmandu against King Gyanendra&#x27;s direct rule. The royal government exercised minimum restraint but declared a curfew to control the deteriorating situation, which was enforced with live firearms and tear gas. After 23 protesters were killed, on 21 April 2006, King Gyanendra announced that he would yield executive authority to a new prime minister chosen by the political parties to oversee the return of democracy. Several party leaders rejected the offer and again demanded that the King call a council to determine the monarchy&#x27;s future role in politics. An agreement was reached between the parties under the supervision of the Indian ruling Congress that the monarchy would have a place in the new constitution. Girija Prasad Koirala was appointed prime minister in the interim. Girija Prasad, as the main leader, had talks with the King and the agreement for monarchy&#x27;s position. As such, on 24 April 2006, Gyanendra reinstated the previous parliament in a televised address to the nation.

===End of direct rule===
The agreement between the parties and Gyanendra under Indian supervision was not honored by the parties. It is widely believed that the then Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was deeply convinced that as long as Gyanendra remained in the power structure, there was always danger to the democratic order in Nepal. On 10 June 2006, the Parliament scrapped the major powers of the king, including his right to veto laws. This ended the idea of a &quot;King in Parliament&quot;, and he was reduced to a figurehead, though for a time he continued to offer felicitations and to receive diplomats. According to Article 167 of the constitution, all executive powers as well as those enjoyed by the king in the previous Constitution were now vested in the prime minister. All powers of the 239-year-old monarchy were stripped, making Gyanendra a civilian king.

Prime Minister Koirala, who had previously supported the continuation of the monarchy, said in March 2007 that he thought Gyanendra should step down. In June, Koirala repeated his call for Gyanendra to abdicate in favor of his grandson Prince Hridayendra.

On 23 August 2007 Nepal&#x27;s transitional government nationalized all the properties Gyanendra inherited from his brother, including the Narayanhiti Royal Palace. The move did not affect the properties he owned before his accession to the throne.

=== Interim suspension of the monarchy ===
It was announced on 24 December 2007 that, following the approval of the Nepalese Parliament, the monarchy would probably be suspended in 2008, as part of a peace deal with Maoist rebels. This was for a bill to amend the constitution to make Nepal a republic.

On 27 May 2008, the meeting decided to give Gyanendra fifteen days to vacate the palace and decided that the first meeting would be held the next day at 11 am; however, it was delayed due to the indecision among the leading parties on power-sharing and the nomination of 26 members of the Constituent Assembly.

On 28 May 2008, the monarchy was officially given no place in the amended constitution of 1990 and was replaced by a republic. This was done by the Constituent Assembly, without a referendum. Gyanendra accepted the decision in the following days. As he was required to leave Narayanhiti, he asked the government to make residential arrangements for him on 1 June, and on 4 June the government decided to give Nagarjuna Palace to Gyanendra.

Gyanendra left the Narayanhiti Palace in Kathmandu on 11 June 2008, moving into the Nagarjuna Palace. His new residence consists of ten buildings including the royal residence Hemanta Bas, three guesthouses (Barsha Bas, Sharad Bas and Grishma Bas), one office secretariat and one staff quarters. Gyanendra and his family moved into the two-storey Hemanta Bas. Following his departure, the Narayanhiti Palace was turned into a museum, while Gyanendra&#x27;s diamond- and ruby-encrusted Crown and royal scepter, along with all the other crown jewels and royal assets, became government property. The royal family&#x27;s departure from the palace was reported as a &quot;major symbolic moment in the fall of the Shah dynasty, which had unified Nepal in the 1760s&quot;.

===Transition to interim republic===
Gyanendra, in an interview with foreign reporters published on 9 April 2008, expressed dissatisfaction over the decision made by the interim parliament to abolish the monarchy after the 10 April Constituent Assembly election. The interview was published in Japan&#x27;s leading newspaper, &quot; Daily Yomiuri&quot;. Speaking to a select group of Japanese correspondents at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace on 4 February 2008, Gyanendra said, &quot;[The decision] doesn&#x27;t reflect the majority view of the people. This isn&#x27;t a democracy.&quot;
However, he conceded that the people do have the right to choose the fate of the monarchy.

Gyanendra also said that law and order in the country was deteriorating, and questioned the interim government&#x27;s ability to govern the country even after he had accepted the road map of the seven-party alliance. Citing the recent survey which showed 49% of respondents favored the continuation of the monarchy in some form, Gyanendra claimed, &quot;A majority of the people find great meaning in the institution of the monarchy. In all clouds, there is a silver lining. Let us hope.&quot;

Gyanendra had broken his closely guarded silence in an interview with a Nepali weekly paper in which he said he remained silent to &quot;let the peace process succeed&quot;. On 7 February 2008 the BBC reported Gyanendra as saying to Japanese journalists: &quot;The Nepali people themselves should speak out on where the nation is heading, on the direction it is taking and on why it is becoming chaotic&quot;.
He claimed that his attempt on 1 February 2005 was for a good purpose—restoring peace and stability in the country. He said that his attempt was not a success and so the countrymen are suffering at present.

In an interview, Gyanendra&#x27;s advisor, Bharat Keshar Singh, claimed that the bill passed by the parliament was a bluff. Replying to a question raised regarding the King&#x27;s silence even after the bill was passed declaring the state a republic, he said that there was nothing for the King to respond to. He claimed that the parliament which declared a republic was reinstated by the King himself and had no authority to dethrone the same King. He claimed that the King was examining the activities of the government and the parliament and was waiting for a suitable time to respond to them. He said that no people would accept the &quot;bill&quot; unless decided by a referendum or elected members in the constituent assembly.

On 15 January 2007 the interim parliament was set up with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) included, and on 1 April 2007, the interim government joined by the Communist Party was formed. On 28 December 2007, the Nepali interim parliament approved a bill for the amendment to the constitution of 1990 promulgated on 15 January 2007, with a clause stating that Nepal would become a federal democratic republic, to be implemented by the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly elections.

In 2020 the RPP-N submitted 2.35 million signatures to the Constituent Assembly demanding a referendum for the fate of the 240-year old monarchy and a Hindu state.

=== Alleged foreign intervention in the fall of the monarchy ===
Senior journalist P. Kharel told BBC Nepali service in an interview that King Gyanendra lost his throne when he refused to make Nepal &quot;a protectorate like Bhutan&quot;. King Gyanendra&#x27;s Honorary Royal ADC Late Bharat Keshar Simha also expressed the same during an interview with Jibram Bhandari on Sagarmatha TV.

==Later life==
In an interview with News 24 TV channel in 2012, Gyanendra stated that he would return as king, although he did not state a particular time frame. When asked if he would consider becoming actively involved in politics, he said that he is not a politician. He also dismissed the need for a referendum on bringing the institution of monarchy back into power. He asserted that since the politicians had not asked the people by a referendum to abolish the institution, a referendum to bring him back was not needed. Gyanendra also stated in the interview with News24 that a written agreement existed between the politicians and himself that the constitutional monarchy would be returned when he gave up his powers to the politicians and restored the Parliament that he had sacked.

Soon after news emerged of a ten-day personal visit to Parbat district in 2012, ten political parties of the district organized a corner meeting at Shibalaya Chowk of Kusmabazaar, and decided to protest against Gyanendra&#x27;s visit. Leaders speaking at the corner assembly called on Gyanendra to stop his visit and also warned that they would obstruct his tour forcibly if he started it. Nevertheless, Gyanendra left for Pokhara. There was no protest on the first day. He walked in the rain through the general public for more than one kilometre. However, the scheduled visit of Gyanendra to Myagdi was cancelled following opposition from different political parties. He had planned to worship at various holy shrines in the district.

During a private party at Trisara restaurant in Durbarmarg, a picture taken of the former king dancing caused significant unrest and outcry, most notably from Prime Minister Prachanda and Former Prime Minister Oli. Critics and citizens alike condemned the remarks of the politicians criticizing the former king&#x27;s private affairs.

On 8 July 2019, the former king&#x27;s birthday was observed by thousands of Nepalese who marked the occasion by marching to his private residence at Nirmal Niwas Palace. The rally was organized by The Main Civilian Birthday Celebration Committee, however, the former king refused to give audience to the crowd as he didn&#x27;t celebrate his birthday in public due to the demise of his relatives. Therefore, the visitors wrote birthday wishes on registers kept at the Nirmal Niwas Palace.

In July 2019, the former king summoned acclaimed political analyst Surendra K.C. where the two discussed the current political environment of the nation. In an interview with Nepal Aaja, KC remarked that the former king did not show any active interest to return to the throne or into politics. However, KC did note that the former monarch showed great concerns for the condition of the Nepalese in times of economic turmoil and political suppression.

In February 2023, the former king attended a public event in Jhapa district to call for the transformation of Nepal from a secular country into a Hindu kingdom. The event was attended by thousands of people.

=== Bhutan Visit === 
Between October 3 and 6, 2024, former King Gyanendra of Nepal visited Bhutan at the invitation of the Bhutanese royal family. 

Former King Gyanendra was welcomed at the airport by HRH Princess Pema Lhaden Wangchuck. A red carpet was rolled out for him upon his arrival, underscoring the significance of his visit to the neighboring Himalayan kingdom. A red carpet welcome was extended to the former King upon his arrival in Bhutan, underscoring the significance of his visit to the neighboring Himalayan kingdom.During his return, King Jigme Khesar Wangchuck of Bhutan bid farewell to Shah at the royal guest house in Thimphu. 

==Wealth==
Despite having all of the properties he inherited from his late brother King Birendra nationalized, the former king still retained all of his wealth prior to his enthronement. Having been a state connected businessman, the former king is said to have inherited huge fortunes from his family members and still runs many lucrative businesses through investments and is widely believed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
In 2008, journalist Surya Thapa stated that King Gyanendra had an investment of at least $200 million in 35 companies throughout Nepal and possibly more abroad.
His investment in Soaltee Hotel alone was estimated to be around $100 million in 2008 with a 47% stake.
Furthermore, the former king is reported to have 54% stake in Himalayan Goodricke Tea, 39% stake in Surya Nepal Tobacco, stakes in Annapurna Hotel which he inherited from aunt Princess Helen, large tea plantations in Itahari, and stakes in Himal International Power Corporation, Jyoti spinning mill in Birgunj, Narayanghat brewery, a Toyota and Tata distributorship, Laxmi Rosin Turpentine Pvt Ltd, Bhotekoshi power company, Sipradi Trading Pvt Ltd, Gorkha Lawrie Pvt Ltd, Amaravati Pvt Ltd, an island in the Maldives and oil interests in Nigeria.

Furthermore, the former king also owns vast swathes of lands throughout Nepal. He also has an extensive real estate portfolio that includes the Nirmal Niwas palace, his personal residence of approximately 36 ropani land at a prime location at Maharajgunj.
He is also reported to possess invaluable Shah and Rana dynasty heirlooms, precious jewels and artwork.

<text>The Nihon Ki-in (), also known as the Japan Go Association, is the main organizational body for Go in Japan, overseeing Japan&#x27;s professional system and issuing diplomas for amateur dan rankings. It is based in Tokyo. The other major Go association in Japan is Kansai Ki-in. 
Its innovations include the Oteai system of promotion, time limits in professional games, and the introduction of issuing diplomas to strong amateur players, to affirm their ranks.

==History==
The Nihon Ki-in was established in July 1924. The first president of the Nihon Ki-in was Makino Nobuaki, a great Go patron himself, with Okura Kishichiro serving as vice president. The vast majority of pros at the time joined the fledgling organization, excepting the Inoue faction in Osaka and Nozawa Chikucho. A brief splinter group called Kiseisha was created soon after the Nihon Ki-in was formed, but most of the players involved had returned to the Nihon Ki-in within a couple of years. Then in 1950, its western branch split away to form the Kansai Ki-in.

==Tournaments==
The Nihon Ki-in organizes many tournaments for professional players. The major title tournaments include the Kisei, Meijin, Honinbo, Judan, Tengen, Gosei, and the Oza. There are also separate Honinbo, Meijin, and Kisei titles for women.

<doc id="313184" wikidata="Q279396" url="?curid=313184" title="Vazgen Sargsyan">
<text>Vazgen Zaveni Sargsyan (, ; 5 March 1959 – 27 October 1999) was an Armenian military commander and politician. He was the first Defence Minister of Armenia from 1991 to 1992 and then from 1995 to 1999. He served as Armenia&#x27;s Prime Minister from 11 June 1999 until his assassination on 27 October of that year. He rose to prominence during the mass movement for the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia in the late 1980s and led Armenian volunteer groups during the early clashes with Azerbaijani forces. Appointed defence minister by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan soon after Armenia&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union in late 1991, Sargsyan became the most prominent commander of Armenian forces during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. In different positions, he regulated the military operations in the war area until 1994, when a ceasefire was reached ending the war with Armenian forces controlling almost all of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts.

In the post-war years, Sargsyan tightened his grip on the Armed Forces of Armenia, establishing himself as a virtual strongman. After strongly supporting Ter-Petrosyan to retain power in 1996, he forced the president out of office in 1998 due to the latter&#x27;s support for concessions in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement negotiations, and helped Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan to be elected president. After his relations with Kocharyan deteriorated, Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group Yerkrapah into the Republican Party and joined forces with Armenia&#x27;s ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan. In the May 1999 elections, their reform-minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Sargsyan became prime minister, emerging as the &quot;de facto&quot; decision-maker in Armenia with effective control of the military and the legislature.

Sargsyan, along with Karen Demirchyan and six others, were killed in the Armenian parliament shooting on 27 October 1999. The perpetrators were sentenced to life in prison. However, the distrust toward the trial process gave birth to a number of conspiracy theories. Some experts and politicians argue that their assassination was masterminded by Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan. Others have suspected the possible involvement of foreign powers in the shooting.

Despite his mixed legacy, Sargsyan is now widely recognized as a national hero across the political spectrum and by the public. Given the honorific Sparapet, he made significant contributions to the establishment of Armenia as independent state and ensuring its security as the founder of the Armenian Army. He has also been criticized by human rights organizations for being undemocratic, especially for his role in elections. Sargsyan was awarded the highest titles of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh—National Hero of Armenia and Hero of Artsakh.

==Early life and career==
Vazgen Zaveni Sargsyan was born in Ararat village, Soviet Armenia, near the Turkish border, on 5 March 1959, to Greta and Zaven Sargsyan. His ancestors had moved to Ararat from Maku, northern Iran, following the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28. After finishing secondary school in his village, he attended the Yerevan Institute of Physical Culture from 1976 to 1979. He worked as a physical education teacher at the secondary school in Ararat from 1979 to 1983. Therefore, he was exempt from conscription in the Soviet army. From 1983 to 1986, he was the Young Communist League (Komsomol) leader at the Ararat Cement Factory.

An amateur writer, Sargsyan developed a literary and active social life. He wrote his first novel in 1980, and became a member of the Writers Union of Armenia in 1985. From 1986 to 1989, he headed the publicity department of the (, &quot;Spring&quot;) literary monthly in Yerevan. In 1986, his first book, &quot;&quot; (, Bread temptation), was published, for which he was awarded by the Armenian Komsomol. A number of his works were published in journals. However, his literary career did not last long and ended in the late 1980s.

==Nagorno-Karabakh conflict==

===Early stages and independence of Armenia===
The relative democratization of the Soviet regime under Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; policies since the mid-1980s gave rise to nationalism in the republics of the Soviet Union. In Armenia, the Karabakh movement gained widespread public support. Armenians demanded the Soviet authorities unify the mostly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) of Azerbaijan with Armenia. In February 1988, the NKAO regional legislature requested the transfer of the region from the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan SSR to Armenian SSR, but it was rejected by the Politburo. Tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis further escalated with the pogrom in Sumgait. With both groups arming themselves, clashes became frequent, especially in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh and the border areas of the two Soviet republics. In 1989 and 1990, Sargsyan took the command of Armenian volunteer groups fighting near Yeraskh, on the Armenian-Azerbaijani (Nakhchivan) border, not far from his hometown.

By January 1990, he became part of the leadership of the Pan-Armenian National Movement. Sargsyan was elected to the Armenian parliament (the Supreme Council) in the May 1990 election. He served as the head of the Supreme Council Commission on Defense and Internal Affairs until December 1991. With his initiative, the Special Regiment was established in September 1990. Composed of 26 platoons and a total of 2,300 men, it was the first formal Armenian military unit independent from Moscow. It became the main base of the Armenian army in the following years.
By 1991, most Armenians from Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis from Armenia were forced to move to their respective countries, as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible. Although Armenia had proclaimed its independence from the Soviet Union on 23 August 1990, it was not until on 21 September 1991, a month after the failed August Coup in Moscow, when the overwhelming majority of Armenians voted for the independence in a nationwide referendum. Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the leader of the Karabakh Committee and the head of the Supreme Council since 1990, was elected president of Armenia in October.

===Active military involvement===

Due to the fact that Sargsyan was popular among Armenian volunteer units and army officers, he was appointed the first Defense Minister of independent Armenia by President Ter-Petrosyan in December 1991. On 28 January 1992, the Armenian government passed the historical decree &quot;On the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Armenia,&quot; which formally created the Armed Forces of Armenia. With the rise of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh, in March 1992, Sargsyan announced that Armenia needed a 30,000-strong army for maintaining security. On 9 May 1992, the Armenian forces recorded their first major military success in Nagorno-Karabakh with the capture of Shushi. Another significant victory for the Armenian forces was recorded weeks later with the capture of Lachin, which connects Armenia proper with Nagorno-Karabakh.

In summer 1992, the situation turned critical for the Armenian forces following the launch of Operation Goranboy, during which Azerbaijan took control of northern half of Nagorno-Karabakh. On 15 August 1992, Sargsyan called on Armenian men to gather and form a volunteer unit to fight against the advancing Azerbaijani forces in the northern parts of Nagorno-Karabakh. In a televised speech he stated: 

The battalion Sargsyan called for, named (, &#x27;Eagles Sentenced to Death&#x27;), was formed on 30 August 1992. Under the command of Major-General Astvatsatur Petrosyan, it defeated the Azerbaijani forces near the Gandzasar monastery and Chldran village in Martakert Province, on 31 August and 1 September 1992, respectively. According to the Armenian Defense Ministry, the battalion&#x27;s activity stopped the advancement of the Azerbaijani forces and turned the course of the war in favor of the Armenian side in the part of the region.

====Armenian military victory====

Between October 1992 and March 1993, Sargsyan served as the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia. Subsequently, he was appointed the State Minister on Defence, Security and Internal Affairs. In these positions, Sargsyan had a major role in the advance of the Armenian army. With other key commanders, he regulated the operations to the Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. He was particularly active in unifying the various semi-independent detachments active in the war zone. Political chaos in Azerbaijan and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet-drawn borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1993, Sargsyan founded and led Yerkrapah, a union of 5,000 war veterans, that had a great influence in Armenia&#x27;s domestic politics in the post-war years and became the main base for Vazgen Sargsyan to rise in power.

In early April 1993, the Armenian forces captured Kelbajar, a city outside the originally contested areas, causing international attention to the conflict. Turkey closed its border with Armenia, while the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the act. In the summer of 1993, Armenian forces gained more territories and, by August controlled Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan. By early 1994, both countries were devastated by the war. On 5 May, the Bishkek Protocol was signed by the heads of the parliaments of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, backed by Armenia, established &quot;de facto&quot; control of these lands. Nagorno-Karabakh (also known as Artsakh to Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized and a &quot;de jure&quot; part of Azerbaijan. However, it is in &quot;de facto&quot; unified with Armenia.

==Minister of Defence and president change==
Sargsyan was appointed Minister of Defence by Ter-Petrosyan on 26 July 1995, during the restructuring of government ministries. He remained in that position for almost four years. The Armenian army was highly regarded by experts with Armenia being described as the only former Soviet state that &quot;managed to build a combat-capable army from scratch&quot; and was &quot;comparable in efficiency to the Soviet Army&quot;. According to Thomas de Waal, the army was &quot;the most powerful institution&quot; in Armenia under him. Sargsyan is credited with substantially professionalizing the Armenian army.

Sargsyan showed strong confidence in the army and stated in 1997 that its strength has doubled in the past two years. In the same year, in response to Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev&#x27;s statements that Azerbaijan was &quot;ready to solve the Karabakh problem by force,&quot; Sargsyan replied, &quot;Let him do it. We are ready.&quot; Sargsyan&#x27;s term as Minister of Defence was marked by cooperation with Russia and Greece. Sargsyan had &quot;close connections&quot; with the Russian military elite, especially Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. According to the Jamestown Foundation, he pursued a military diplomacy with Greece, Cyprus, Syria, Iran and Bulgaria for a pro-Russian alliance.

===A &#x27;power minister&#x27;: 1995–96 elections===

Sargsyan became a key figure in post-war Armenia due to the fact that he was indisputably supported by the army, the only well established institution in Armenia. He was described as an &quot;éminence grise&quot; of the Armenian politics, deciding many personnel appointments and dismissals. In the aftermath of the war, which was accompanied by a harsh economic crisis in Armenia, President Ter-Petrosyan became unpopular. His authoritarian rule, the banning of the major opposition party Armenian Revolutionary Federation in 1994 and the arrest of its leaders, made him highly dependent on the &quot;power structures,&quot; which included the ministries of defence (headed by Sargsyan), interior (Vano Siradeghyan) and national security (Serzh Sargsyan). In July 1995, Vazgen Sargsyan helped Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s Pan-Armenian National Movement (PANM) win the parliamentary election and pass the constitutional referendum that gave the president more powers in appointing and dismissing key judicial and legislative officials. They were marred with major electoral violations.

Sargsyan&#x27;s impact on Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s presidency became more evident during the 1996 presidential election and the subsequent developments. A few days before the election, Sargsyan stated his support for Ter-Petrosyan, stating that Armenia &quot;will enter the 21st century victoriously and stable with Ter-Petrosyan [as president]&quot;. According to the Caucasian Regional Studies, Sargsyan &quot;turned off the voters&quot; from Ter-Petrosyan and caused &quot;irritation and antipathy&quot; in 28.6% of the people according to a poll. The election, held on 22 September, was largely criticized by observation and monitoring organizations, that found &quot;serious violations of the election law&quot;. 

Official results, which recorded Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s victory in the first round with just above 50% of the total vote in his favor, were denounced by opposition candidate Vazgen Manukyan who had officially received 41% of the vote. Manukyan began demonstrations claiming electoral fraud by Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s supporters. The protests culminated on 25 September, when Manukyan led thousands of his supporters to the parliament building on Baghramyan Avenue, where the Electoral Commission was located at the time. Later during the day, the protesters broke the fence surrounding the parliament and entered the building. They beat up the parliament speaker Babken Ararktsyan and vice-speaker Ara Sahakyan. In response, Vazgen Sargsyan stated that &quot;even if they [the opposition] win 100 percent of the votes, neither the Army nor the National Security and Interior Ministry would recognize such political leaders.&quot; He was later criticized by human rights organizations for this statement. State security forces, tanks and troops were deployed in Yerevan to restore order and to enforce the ban on rallies and demonstrations on 26 September. Sargsyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan announced that their respective agencies had prevented an attempted coup d&#x27;état.

According to Astourian, in the crackdown Vazgen Sargsyan &quot;intervened with an armed detachment and ordered the soldiers and the police to shoot at the legs of the demonstrators. Sargsian himself actually participated in the shooting.&quot; According to Freedom House, Sargsyan was allegedly involved in beating and seriously injuring Ruben (Rubik) Hakobyan, an MP from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), after he was arrested during the demonstrations.

===Leadership split: Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s resignation===
In 1997, the OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, the United States and France, pressured Armenia and Azerbaijan to agree on the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh. In September, Ter-Petrosyan stated his support of the &quot;step-by-step&quot; proposal, which included the return of the territories outside the NKAO borders. Ter-Petrosyan argued the normalization of relations with Azerbaijan and, therefore, the opening of the border with Turkey was the only way to significantly improve Armenia&#x27;s economy. After the plan was publicized, he came up against strong opposition. The issue was &quot;important to the Armenians because of historical and psychological factors. After having been losing territories for centuries, the Armenians are reluctant to &#x27;lose&#x27; Karabakh now that they have won a war against Azerbaijan.&quot; According to political scientist Vicken Cheterian, &quot;By calling for major concessions on Karabakh, Ter-Petrosyan was antagonizing the last forces that supported his rule, the army and the Karabakh elite, at a time when his popularity within the Armenian society was at its lowest.&quot;

The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic leadership, the Armenian intelligentsia and the diaspora, the opposition also expressed their opposition to the president’&#x27;s support for the proposed settlement plan. Vazgen Sargsyan, who quickly denounced the proposal, became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the opposing group within the government. He was joined by the two Karabakh Armenians in the government: Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan and Interior and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan. These three politicians were referred to as &quot;hardliners&quot; in the Western media for their perceived nationalistic stance. They argued that &quot;Armenia should try to improve its economic performance,&quot; while Ter-Petrosyan insisted that Armenia &quot;could only achieve marginal improvements insufficient to address the fear of relative decline and economic exclusion&quot;. The Kocharyan cabinet, where Vazgen Sargsyan was a leading figure, called for a &quot;package&quot; deal, &quot;involving a single framework accord on all contentious issues&quot;. On 21 October 1997, ten members of the Republic bloc in the parliament left the faction and shifted their support to Vazgen Sargsyan. Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s bloc in the parliament was left with a majority of two seats. Despite the great public and political opposition, the Pan-Armenian National Movement voted in favor of Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s foreign policy.
During the National Security Council meeting on 7–8 January 1998 it became clear that Ter-Petrosyan did not have enough support to continue his reign as president. On 23 January 1998, during the peak of the crisis, Vazgen Sargsyan declared his unconditional support to Robert Kocharyan, and blamed the Pan-Armenian National Movement for trying to destabilize Armenia. Sargsyan also guaranteed that the Armenian army &quot;will not intervene in the political struggle&quot;.

Ter-Petrosyan announced his resignation on 3 February 1998. According to Michael P. Croissant, it was Vazgen Sargsyan who &quot;played ultimately the principal role in inducting the president&#x27;s resignation&quot;. In his resignation statement, Ter-Petrosyan referred to Vazgen Sargsyan, Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan as &quot;the well known body of power&quot;. He cited the threat of destabilization of the country as the reason of his resignation. Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s resignation was followed by the resignation of National Assembly speaker Babken Ararktsyan, his two deputies, Mayor of Yerevan Vano Siradeghyan, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Arzoumanian and others. A significant change occurred in the National Assembly. Dozens of members of the parliamentary faction called the Republican Bloc (mostly made up of Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s Pan-Armenian National Movement) joined Vazgen Sargsyan&#x27;s Yerkrapah bloc, making it the largest parliamentary bloc, with 69 members compared to only 56 for the Republic.

After Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s resignation, Prime Minister Kocharyan became acting president. On 5 February 1998, Sargsyan denied the claims of a coup d&#x27;état and said that Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s resignation was &quot;rather sad but natural&quot;. Sargsyan claimed that the president&#x27;s move surprised him and that he had &quot;been seeking common grounds with the president for the past three months&quot;. He added, &quot;the only step I achieved on the Karabakh issue was the suggestion that the situation be frozen.&quot; Almost a year after Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s resignation, Vazgen Sargsyan stated at the Republican Party convention that he &quot;respects and appreciates&quot; Ter-Petrosyan and described him as a &quot;wise and a moral man and politician&quot;. Sargsyan insisted that the question of &quot;political responsibility&quot; was the main reason behind his resignation, and stated that if Ter-Petrosyan had decided not to resign, &quot;no one could have removed him&quot; and that Sargsyan would have resigned as defence minister instead. Commenting on the circumstances of his resignation in 2021, Ter-Petrosyan insisted that Vazgen Sargsyan and Kocharyan were &quot;ready for civil war&quot; if he did not resign. 

===1998 election: Kocharyan as president===

Sargsyan (along with Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan) openly supported Kocharyan and used his influence for his election in March. He called Kocharyan a &quot;man of unity of word and action&quot; and stated that his experience in Karabakh and Armenia &quot;shows that he is capable of solving economic problems also&quot;. Kocharyan&#x27;s main opponent was Karen Demirchyan, the leader of Soviet Armenia from 1974 to 1988. Sargsyan praised Kocharyan for being part of the &quot;struggle of the Armenian people&quot; and criticized Demirchyan for not being part of it.

No candidate gained more than half of the votes in the first round, while in the second round of the election, held on 30 March, Kocharyan won 58.9% of the vote. The British Helsinki Human Rights Group suggests that &quot;ordinary Armenians turned to Robert Kocharian as someone untainted by mafia connections and the intrigues of Yerevan politics.&quot; The OSCE observation mission described the first round as &quot;deeply flawed,&quot; while their final report stated that the mission found &quot;serious flaws&quot; and that the election did not meet the OSCE standards. Although Demirchyan didn&#x27;t officially dispute the election results, he never accepted them and did not congratulate Kocharyan. After the election, however, Sargsyan suggested Kocharyan appoint Demirchyan prime minister to decrease the tensions in the political scene.

Even after becoming president, Kocharyan did not have any significant institutional support (e.g. a party, control of the army, a source of money) and remained &quot;in a fundamental sense an outsider in Yerevan&quot;. Kocharyan had a more tough position on the Karabakh settlement issue than Ter-Petrosyan. He also urged the international community to recognize the Armenian genocide, something on which his predecessor did not place importance. In response, Turkey and Azerbaijan tightened their cooperation in isolating Armenia from regional projects. Kocharyan did not put pressure on the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership to concede territory to Azerbaijan. He was supported by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which was allowed to actively operate after Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s resignation a month before the election.

==Rise in power==
===Politicization of Yerkrapah===
By 1998 Vazgen Sargsyan became &quot;the power behind the throne&quot; as the Yerkrapah faction—made up of war veterans loyal to him—was the single largest faction in the Armenian parliament following Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s resignation in February 1998.
Yerkrapah was merged with the Republican Party of Armenia—a minor party with an ideology similar to that of Yerkrapah—in summer 1998, taking the party&#x27;s name and its legal status. Though Sargsyan was not the chairman of the Republican Party, he was considered its unofficial leader.

The relations between Sargsyan and Kocharyan deteriorated after the presidential election with Sargsyan &quot;casting around for partners unconnected with or downright opposed to the president&quot;. Within several months three assassinations of top officials took place that spread rumors in Armenia that relations between Sargsyan and Kocharyan were &quot;not normal&quot;. In August 1998 Armenia&#x27;s Prosecutor-General Henrik Khachatryan, a close friend of Kocharyan, was murdered in his office &quot;in murky circumstances&quot;. In December 1998 Deputy Minister of Defence Vahram Khorkhoruni was murdered &quot;for equally mysterious motives&quot;, while in February 1999 Deputy Minister of the Interior Artsrun Margaryan was murdered. Vazgen Sargsyan and National Security and Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan, Kocharyan&#x27;s close ally, were &quot;also perceived to be at odds&quot;.

=== Alliance with Demirchyan ===
It was initially announced that the Republican Party would go to the parliamentary election alone and would seek &quot;qualitative majority&quot; in the parliament, and that their goal was the fairness of the electoral process. Surprisingly for many, on 30 March 1999, Vazgen Sargsyan and the runner-up of the 1998 presidential election and Armenia&#x27;s ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan issued a joint announcement that they were forming an alliance between the People&#x27;s Party of Armenia and the Republican Party. It came to be known as the Unity bloc (), often referred to as . Vazgen Sargsyan claimed the bloc was a &quot;genuine&quot; alliance and that the two parties had come together to lead Armenia &quot;from a turning point to progress&quot;. When asked about the reasons why he joined Demirchyan, Sargsyan said that, &quot;there is no other way out.&quot; According to the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Sargsyan &quot;obviously concluded it was better to have the popular Demirchyan as an ally than an opponent,&quot; and that &quot;in forming Unity bloc, Sargsyan and Demirchyan overcame whatever ideological differences they may have had, and said they had joined forces to overcome the difficult problems facing Armenia while promoting tolerance in the country&#x27;s political life.&quot; In analyst Richard Giragosian&#x27;s words, the bloc was &quot;an odd mix,&quot; however he admitted that it &quot;effectively marginalized the electoral threat&quot; of other parties. Sociologist Levon Baghdasaryan described it as &quot;unification of the new and old &quot;nomenklaturas&quot;&quot;. The British Helsinki Human Rights Group wrote of the Unity bloc that it &quot;aimed to appeal to the electorate by being all things to all men&quot;. The ODIHR suggested that the &quot;alliance was not only created for electoral purposes, but that a strategic political agreement had been reached while overcoming ideological differences&quot;.

===1999 parliamentary election===

During the campaign, Sargsyan pledged that he would spare no effort to make sure the elections were free and fair. Sargsyan and Demirchyan put the emphasis of their campaign on the economy and the improvement of the life of ordinary Armenians. Talking about Yerkrapah—now politically transformed into the Republican Party—Sargsyan said he was confident &quot;that the people that gained victory on the battlefield will also gain victory in economy&quot;. He expressed his optimism saying that they were sure that they &quot;will jointly change something and find the right course&quot;. The Unity bloc &quot;called broadly for a democratic society, rule of law, economic reforms and a market economy, with the state also creating conditions for the normal functioning of state enterprises and ensuring decent living standards for all&quot;. Throughout the campaign, the Unity bloc was widely considered the favorite of the election. Opposition newspaper suggested that most other political parties in Armenia were gravitating towards the opposite pole, around Kocharyan, National Security &amp; Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and the leadership of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.

The parliamentary election took place on 30 May 1999, just two months after Sargsyan&#x27;s and Demirchyan&#x27;s announcement about their decision to form an alliance. The Unity bloc won over 41.5% of the popular vote, and took 62 of the 131 seats in the National Assembly. The alliance established an effective majority with cooperating with a group of 25 independent and officially non-affiliated members of the parliament, sympathetic to the Sargsyan-Demirchyan coalition. The electoral process &quot;generally showed an improvement over the [previous] flawed elections, but ODIHR said they were &quot;not an adequate basis for comparison&quot;. ODIHR&#x27;s final report described the election as &quot;a step towards compliance with OSCE Commitments&quot; and claimed that, along with improvements to the electoral framework and the political environment, serious issues remained. The Council of Europe also suggested &quot;considerable improvement&quot; from the past elections. The National Democratic Institute report was more critical, saying it &quot;failed to meet international standards&quot; and that it proved to be the continuation of the flawed 1995 parliamentary elections, differing only in &quot;the methods and types of manipulation&quot;.

==Prime minister ==
At the Republican Party convention in January 1999. Sargsyan stated his desire in remaining in the position of Minister of Defence. After the election speculations arose about Sargsyan wanting to combine the positions of defence minister and prime minister, however, this was impossible according to the Armenian constitution. On 11 June 1999 he became Prime Minister of Armenia, while Unity bloc co-chairman Karen Demirchyan was elected speaker of the National Assembly.

Many experts suggest that Sargsyan as prime minister was the most powerful politician in Armenia, while others suggest that he had become Armenia&#x27;s strongest politician long before that. According to Mark Grigorian, his &quot;activities had began to overshadow&quot; Kocharyan. Despite Kocharyan&#x27;s formal welcome of their alliance, the president was &quot;effectively weakened&quot; and &quot;was being sidelined&quot;. Some political analysts suggested that the Sargsyan-Demirchyan alliance &quot;ultimately would bring about the resignation of Kocharyan&quot;. Vazgen Manukyan stated that Kocharyan &quot;would end up like the &quot;Queen of England&quot;. Despite no longer being the Minister of Defence, Vazgen Sargsyan remained the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the army, as a close ally, Vagharshak Harutiunyan, replaced him.

According to Styopa Safaryan, an analyst and former member of the Armenian parliament, despite his mixed legacy, under Vazgen Sargsyan Armenia became increasingly independent.


===Economic policy===
At the time of Sargsyan&#x27;s Prime Ministry, Armenia had not yet recovered from the economic effects of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the energy crisis in Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. One of the major issues Sargsyan faces was mass emigration from Armenia, which started at the period of the decline of the Soviet regime. The 1998 Russian financial crisis worsened the situation, and showed a decline in human development.

In his first address to the parliament as prime minister on 18 June, Sarsgyan described Armenia&#x27;s economic situation as &quot;grave.&quot; The budget revenues were almost 20% lower than the government had planned, because of the low level of tax collection and the high level of corruption in the Armenian economy. Although Sargsyan criticized the post-Soviet privatization by the Ter-Petrosyan government, he admitted Armenia had no alternative, and that his government had an enormous amount of work to do. In his speech on 28 July, Sargsyan described the economic situation in Armenia as &quot;extremely difficult, but not hopeless&quot;. According to him, the first half of 1999 saw $61 million less in the budged revenues than planned by the Darbinyan government. He said that tax evasion played a role in the budget deficit.

Despite being criticized by the opposition, especially the National Democratic Union, the Unity bloc voted in favor (96 of the 131 MPs) of the austerity measures of the Sargsyan cabinet on 28 August, allowing Armenia to take loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The World Bank alone had loaned almost $0.5 billion to Armenia since 1992 to finance the budget deficits. The Sargsyan cabinet wanted to diversify $32 million in the budget funds to be able to repay the internal debts. For this purpose, the excise tax was raised on cigarettes by 200% and on gasoline by 45%, seriously hitting the middle class. Sargsyan described these as &quot;painful but right steps&quot; for getting the necessary amount of money from the foreign lenders. He pledged a &quot;tougher crackdown on the shadow economy and more efficient governance&quot;. National Assembly Speaker Karen Demirchyan called for a greater role of the state in the economy to ensure stability, while President Kocharyan was mostly uninvolved in these developments.

===Notable events===
During his Prime Ministry, Sargsyan helped to organize three major events. On 28 August 1999, the first Pan-Armenian Games began in Yerevan. Over 1,400 Armenian athletes from 23 countries participated in the games. The closing ceremony took place in the Yerevan Sports and Concerts Complex on 5 September, with President Robert Kocharyan and Vazgen Sargsyan in attendance. Just after the Games, which involved thousands of diaspora Armenian youth, the preparations for the eighth anniversary of Armenia&#x27;s independence began.

On 21 September, the anniversary of the day in 1991 when Armenians voted in favor of leaving the Soviet Union in a referendum, a military parade was held in Yerevan&#x27;s Republic Square. Vazgen Sargsyan &quot;was visibly the most excited of the government leaders standing on a specially built pedestal&quot;. In a short briefing after the parade, Sargsyan enthusiastically stated that he had &quot;touched almost every piece of hardware you&#x27;ve just seen&quot; and continued that he &quot;just wanted to show it&quot; to the Armenian people.

During the next two days, on 22 and 23 September 1999, the first Armenia-Diaspora Conference was held in Yerevan. The conference brought together the Armenian political elite and many diaspora organizations, political parties, religious leaders, writers and over 1,200 representatives of Armenian communities from 53 countries, an unprecedented number. Vazgen Sargsyan opened the second day of the conference with his speech-report about the economic and social situation in Armenia. The conference was closed by Sargsyan.

==Death==
On 27 October 1999, at around 5:15 pm,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wines NY Times 28/10/99&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; five assailants—Nairi Hunanyan, his brother Karen, their uncle Vram and two others—armed with Kalashnikov rifles hidden under long coats, broke into the National Assembly building in Yerevan, while the government was holding a question-and-answer session. They shot and killed Sargsyan, National Assembly Speaker Karen Demirchyan, Deputy National Assembly Speakers Yuri Bakhshyan and Ruben Miroyan, Minister of Urgent Affairs Leonard Petrosyan, and Parliament Members Henrik Abrahamyan, Armenak Armenakyan and Mikayel Kotanyan. The gunmen injured at least 30 people in the parliament. The group claimed they were carrying out a coup d&#x27;état. They described their act as &quot;patriotic&quot; and &quot;needed for the nation to regain its senses&quot;. They said they wanted to &quot;punish the authorities for what they do to the nation&quot; and described the government as profiteers &quot;sucking the blood of the people&quot;. They claimed Armenia was in a &quot;catastrophic situation&quot; and that &quot;corrupt officials&quot; were not doing anything to provide the way out. Vazgen Sargsyan was the main target of the group and the other deaths were said to be unintended. According to reporters who witnessed the shooting, the men went up to Sargsyan and said, &quot;Enough of drinking our blood,&quot; to which Sargsyan calmly responded, &quot;Everything is being done for you and the future of your children.&quot; Vazgen Sargsyan was hit several times. Anna Israelyan, an eyewitness journalist, stated that &quot;the first shots were fired directly at Vazgen Sargsyan at a distance of one to two meters&quot; and, in her words, &quot;it was impossible that he would have survived.&quot; Sargsyan&#x27;s body was taken out of the parliament building on the evening of 27 October.

With policemen, army troops, armed with APCs surrounding the building. President Kocharyan gave a speech on TV, announcing that the situation was under control. The gunmen released the hostages after overnight negotiations with President Kocharyan and gave themselves up on the morning of 28 October, after a standoff that lasted 17–18 hours.

===Funeral===
On 28 October, President Kocharyan declared a three-day mourning period. The state funeral ceremony for the victims of the parliament shooting took place from 30 to 31 October 1999. The bodies of the victims, including Vazgen Sargsyan, were placed inside the Yerevan Opera Theater. A number of high-ranking officials from some 30 countries, including Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin and the Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, attended the funeral. Karekin II, the Catholicos of All Armenians and Aram I, the Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia gave prayers.

===Investigation and conspiracy theories===
The five men were charged with terrorism aimed at undermining authority on 29 October. The investigation was led by Gagik Jhangiryan, the chief military prosecutor of Armenia, who claimed his team was looking for the masterminds of the shooting even after the trial had begun. According to Jhangiryan, the investigating team considered more than a dozen theories. By January 2000, Jhangiryan&#x27;s investigators considered the connection of Kocharyan and his circle to the parliament shooting. Several figures close to Kocharyan were arrested, including Aleksan Harutiunyan, the deputy presidential adviser, and Harutiun Harutiunyan, the deputy director of the Public Television of Armenia, but they were released by the summer of that year. Eventually, Jhangiryan failed to find evidence linking Kocharyan to the shooting. The trial began in February 2001 and eventually, the five main perpetrators of the shooting (Nairi Hunanyan, his younger brother Karen Hunanyan, their uncle Vram Galstyan, Derenik Ejanyan and Eduard Grigoryan) were sentenced to life in prison on 2 December 2003.
A number of conspiracy theories developed about possible motives and architects behind the attack. Stepan Demirchyan, Karen Demirchyan&#x27;s son, stated in 2009 that &quot;nothing was done by the authorities to prevent that crime and, conversely, everything was done to cover up the crime.&quot; In March 2013, Vazgen Sargsyan&#x27;s younger brother Aram stated he had many questions for both governments of Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan. He claimed the judicial process of 27 October had &quot;deepened the public distrust in the authorities... [as] many questions remain unanswered today&quot;. According to him, the full disclosure of the shooting is &quot;vital&quot; for Armenia. Sargsyan insisted that he &quot;never accused this or the former authorities of being responsible for 27 October. I have accused them of not fully disclosing the 27 October event.&quot; In an April 2013 interview, Karen Demirchyan&#x27;s widow, Rita, suggested the shooting was ordered from outside Armenia and was not an attempt at a coup, but rather an assassination.

Although the investigation did not find any considerable evidence linking Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group, many Armenian politicians and analysts believe that President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and other leading politicians. Former mayor of Yerevan Albert Bazeyan stated in 2002 that &quot;We have come to the conclusion that the crime was aimed at making Robert Kocharian&#x27;s power unlimited and uncontrolled. By physically eliminating Karen Demirchyan and Vazgen Sargsyan, its organizers wanted to create prerequisites for Kocharyan&#x27;s victory in the future presidential elections.&quot; Levon Ter-Petrosyan accused Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan and their &quot;criminal-oligarchic&quot; system of being the real perpetrators of the parliament shooting. Nairi Hunanyan, the leader of the armed group, was a former member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF, Dashnaktsutyun). According to the ARF, Hunanyan was expelled from the party in 1992 for misconduct and had not been in any association with the ARF since then. Some speculations have been made about the involvement of the ARF in the shootings. In 2000, Ashot Manucharyan stated he was worried that &quot;a number of Dashnaktsutyun party leaders are acting in the interest of the American foreign policy.&quot;

====Allegations of foreign involvement====
Some analysts have suggested that foreign powers, including Russia, may have been behind the shooting. They pointed out the fact that Armenia and Azerbaijan were close in signing some kind of an agreement at the OSCE 1999 Istanbul summit over Karabakh, something not in Russia&#x27;s interest.

Russian secret service defector Alexander Litvinenko accused the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of having organised the Armenian parliament shooting, ostensibly to derail the peace process, which would have resolved the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but he offered no evidence to support the accusation. Russian and Armenian officials denied this claims.

The French-based Armenian political refugee and former Apostolic priest Artsruni Avetisysan (also known by his religious name Ter Girgor) gave an interview to Armenian media network A1plus, in which he claimed the Russian secret services were behind the 27 October 1999, shooting. He also claimed the shooting was perpetrated by Lieutenant General Vahan Shirkhanyan, the Deputy Minister of Defense from 1992 to 1999, and the National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan. He insisted the shooting was assisted by the Russian secret services to bring the &quot;Neo-Bolshevik criminal clan&quot; of Serzh Sargsyan and Robert Kocharyan into power.

Others suggested that it was in the best interest of the West to remove Sargsyan and Demirchyan from the political scene, as they had close ties to Russia. Ashot Manucharyan, one of the leading members of the Karabakh Committee, the former Minister of Internal Affairs and Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s National Security Adviser and his close ally until 1993, stated in October 2000 that Armenian officials were warned by a foreign country about the shootings. He also declared that &quot;Western special services&quot; were involved in 27 October events. In Manucharyan&#x27;s words, &quot;the special services of the U.S. and France are acting to destroy Armenia and, in this context, they are much likely to be involved in the realization of the terrorist acts in Armenia.&quot; Manucharyan claimed the shooting was planned by Kocharyan to get rid of his two major rivals (Sargsyan and Demirchyan), who were against the Goble plan, involving territorial concessions to Azerbaijan.

===Aftermath===
Just after the shooting, the Interior and National Security Ministers Suren Abrahamyan and Serzh Sargsyan resigned as a result of pressure from the Defence Ministry, led by Sargsyan&#x27;s ally, Vagharshak Harutiunyan at the time. From early June to late October 1999, the political system in Armenia was based on the Demirchyan-Sargsyan tandem, which controlled the military, the legislative and the executive branches. The assassinations disrupted the political balance in the country and the political arena of Armenia was left in disarray for months. The &quot;de facto dual command&quot; of Sargsyan and Demirchyan was transferred to President Robert Kocharyan. James R. Hughes claims that the so-called &quot;Karabakh clan&quot; (i.e. Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan) was &quot;kept in check&quot; by Vazgen Sargsyan and his &quot;military-security apparatus,&quot; while after the parliament shooting it came to be the sole influential group able to successfully take over the political scene in Armenia. Since the leaders of the Unity bloc were assassinated, the two parties in the alliance (the Republican Party of Armenia and the People&#x27;s Party of Armenia) gradually ceased collaborating and by late 2000, the Unity bloc collapsed. Yerkrapah, the Republican Party, and the People&#x27;s Party effectively lost their influence by 2001.

==Personal life and brothers==
Sargsyan never married. According to Razmik Martirosyan, a friend and the Minister of Social Security from 1999 to 2003, Sargsyan promised in December 1987 that he would marry sometime before 8 March of the next year, but did not because the Karabakh movement started in February. In a 1997 interview, Sargsyan revealed that his favorite historical military figure was Charles de Gaulle. When asked about what kind of Armenia he would like to see in five years, he said &quot;an independent, self-sufficient country with strong culture, school and army&quot;.
Sargsyan had two younger brothers, Aram and Armen. Aram was appointed prime minister by President Kocharyan on 3 November 1999, a week after Vazgen Sargsyan&#x27;s death, largely as a &quot;political gesture&quot;. He admitted that Armenia has &quot;no concept of state security&quot; and that fact led to the assassination of his brother. Aram Sargsyan served in the position of the Prime Minister for only six months. He was dismissed by Kocharyan on 2 May 2000, due to &quot;inability to work&quot; with Sargsyan&#x27;s cabinet. In his television statement, Kocharyan claimed that he relieved Aram Sargsyan to end the &quot;disarray&quot; in the Armenian leadership. Kocharyan blamed him for being involved in &quot;political games&quot;.

Aram Sargsyan founded the Hanrapetutyun Party in April 2001, along with several influential Yerkrapah members, such as the former Mayor of Yerevan Albert Bazeyan and former Defence Minister Vagharshak Harutyunyan. Its co-founder Bazeyan stated that the party is the &quot;bearer of the political heritage of Vazgen Sargsian and will try to realize the programs aborted by the October 27 crime and its consequences&quot;. The party backed up Stepan Demirchyan against Kocharyan in 2003 and Levon Ter-Petrosyan against Serzh Sargsyan in the 2008 presidential elections. In a 2013 interview, Aram Sargsyan talked about the past 14 years after his brother&#x27;s death:
Vazgen Sargsyan&#x27;s other brother, Armen, supported Serzh Sargsyan in the 2013 presidential election. On 5 March 2013, Aram Sargsyan was asked about his brother Armen&#x27;s political stance, to which he responded, &quot;I would very much like to ask Vazgen that question. I don&#x27;t know what he would have answered. There are very few questions to which I don&#x27;t know what Vazgen&#x27;s answer would be. Unfortunately, our friends and relatives are not always the way we want them to be. I am not the first one, neither am I the last one; the history of the world is full of such examples starting from the Bible.&quot;

==Legacy and tribute==
Vazgen Sargsyan was awarded the title Hero of Artsakh, the highest award of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, in 1998. On 27 December 1999, two months after the parliament shooting, Sargsyan was posthumously given the title National Hero of Armenia. He widely is recognized as the founder of the Armenian army.

A presidential decree issued on 28 December 1999 renamed the Yerevan Military Academy to the Vazgen Sargsyan Military University in his honor. The Republican Stadium in Yerevan was named after Vazgen Sargsyan by the same decree. The 8th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Artsakh Defence Army is named after him. Numerous streets in Armenia and Karabakh, including one in Yerevan&#x27;s Kentron (Central) district and in Stepanakert, and a park in Kapan are named after Sargsyan. Statues or busts have been erected in his honor in Yerevan (2007), Ararat (2009), Vanadzor, Kapan (2015), Vagharshapat (Ejmiatsin, 2015), Shushi (Shushi) and other locations. In 2000, 27 October was declared a day of remembrance by the Armenian government. In 2002, the Armenian Defence Ministry created the Medal of Vazgen Sargsyan, which is awarded for &quot;meritorious services towards military education and improvements in service life&quot;.
Every year, on 5 March (his birthday) and 27 October (the day of his assassination), Sargsyan is commemorated in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. His comrades from the Yerkrapah Volunteer Union, high state officials and many others visit the Yerablur cemetery, where Sargsyan is buried next to many Armenian military figures.

Vazgen Sargsyan&#x27;s museum was opened in his hometown of Ararat on 5 March 2001 by the decision made by the Armenian government. Notable attendees of the opening ceremony of the museum included Prime Minister Andranik Margaryan, National Assembly Speaker Armen Khachatryan, Defence Minister Serzh Sargsyan, and other high-ranking military and diplomatic representatives, such as the former Russian Minister of Defence Pavel Grachev, who revealed in his speech at the ceremony that Sargsyan was once his student.

Sargsyan is often referred to as Sparapet, a military rank that has existed since the ancient Kingdom of Armenia. The phrase (literally meaning &#x27;Supreme Commander of the Armenians&#x27;) is engraved on Sargsyan&#x27;s memorial in Yerablur cemetery. The song &quot;Sparapet&quot; by Alla Levonyan is dedicated to his memory.

===Public image and recognition===
In Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and, to a lesser extent, in the Armenian diaspora, Vazgen Sargsyan is recognized as a national hero. Several survey conducted by Gallup, Inc., International Republican Institute, and the Armenian Sociological Association from 2006 to 2008, revealed that Vazgen Sargsyan topped the list of national heroes in public perception, with 15%–20% of the respondents giving his name. He has often ranked third, behind 20th-century military commanders Andranik and Garegin Nzhdeh, in surveys about the greatest Armenian national heroes. Sargsyan is widely considered a charismatic leader. He was generally perceived as a man of &quot;tremendous power and charisma,&quot; known for his &quot;brutality, temper, and nonchalant attitude toward the law&quot;.
His contributions have been acknowledged by his colleagues and comrades. In 1997, President Ter-Petrosyan stated that Sargsyan is someone who deserves the title of National Hero of Armenia. He added that &quot;if all members of our government worked as conscientiously and selflessly as Vazgen Sargsyan, we would live in a perfect state.&quot; Armenia&#x27;s second president Robert Kocharyan said in his speech during Sargsyan&#x27;s funeral, &quot;history will provide its assessment of Vazgen Sargsyan as a politician who stood at the birth of the Armenian state. His role in the creation of the national army is beyond appraisal. By his life and commitment, Vazgen Sargsyan has made an immense contribution to the establishment of a powerful country.&quot; In 2007, giving a speech on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Armenian Armed Forces, then-Defence Minister Serzh Sargsyan noted that he &quot;was a valiant soldier dedicated to the cause of our statehood, and who revered the strength of Armenia and the strength of the Armenian soldier, and who had a staunch belief in our future success&quot;.

Manvel Grigoryan, leader of the Yerkrapah Volunteer Union, recognized Sargsyan&#x27;s contributions, stating that Sargsyan &quot;was a strong individual and his greatness was felt not only during the war, but during the nation-building years after the war&quot;. According to Grigoryan &quot;his presence was enough for the foreign leaders to become vigilant.&quot; Dr. Ara Sanjian, the director of the Armenian Studies at the Haigazian University, wrote shortly after Sargsyan&#x27;s assassination:

In the West, Sargsyan was generally described as a hard nationalist. The British journalist Jonathan Steele wrote of Sargsyan as &quot;a fierce nationalist who always preferred action and force to words and diplomacy&quot;. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes Sargsyan as an &quot;Armenian nationalist who devoted much of his life to the Armenian fight with Azerbaijan for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave&quot;. Political scientist Razmik Panossian expressed the opinion that he was &quot;the last significant nationalist politician whose commitment to Karabakh &quot;and&quot; Armenia was not doubted by anyone&quot;.

===Criticism===
Sargsyan was criticized for being undemocratic, particularly for using his influence in pre-determining the election results. The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe suggested in 1999 that his &quot;record does not inspire confidence in his commitment to democracy.&quot; The 2008 book &quot;Religious Freedom in the World&quot; described him as &quot;thuggish&quot; and held him responsible for the 1995 assaults on religious minorities in Armenia (especially those that discourage military service), carried out, allegedly, by Yerkrapah.

Thomas de Waal describes Sargsyan as an &quot;emerging feudal baron.&quot; The Yerkrapah, founded by Sargsyan, &quot;took over large areas of the economy.&quot; Astourian quoted David Petrosyan, a columnist for the news agency and a &quot;thoughtful observer of Armenia&#x27;s political life&quot;, as claiming that Sargsyan &quot;controlled part of the local market in oil products, part of the incomes generated from transport junctions and the greater part of bread production.&quot; According to Philip Remler, Sargsyan was one of the prime beneficiaries of the illicit income from the Iran-Armenia border and the &quot;godfather of cross-border trade and contraband&quot;.

<text>The Henschel Hs 117 &quot;Schmetterling&quot; (German for &quot;Butterfly&quot;) was a radio-guided German surface-to-air missile project developed during World War II. There was also an air-to-air version, the Hs 117H.

The operators used a telescopic sight and a joystick to guide the missile by radio control, which was detonated by acoustic and photoelectric proximity fuses, at .

== Development ==
In 1941, Professor Herbert A. Wagner (who was previously responsible for the Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship missile) invented the Schmetterling missile and submitted it to the Reich Air Ministry (RLM), who rejected the design because there was no need for more anti-aircraft weaponry.

However, by 1943 the large-scale bombing of Germany caused the RLM to change its mind, and Henschel was given a contract to develop and manufacture it. The team was led by Professor Wagner, and it produced a weapon somewhat resembling a bottlenose dolphin with swept wings and cruciform tail.

In May 1944, 59 Hs 117 missiles were tested, some from beneath a Heinkel He 111; over half the trials failed. Mass production was ordered in December 1944, with deployment to start in March 1945. Operational missiles were to be launched from a 37mm gun carriage.

In January 1945, a prototype for mass production was completed, and production of 3,000 missiles a month was anticipated, but on 6 February, &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Hans Kammler cancelled the project.

== Variants ==
The Hs 117H was an air-launched variant, designed to be launched from a Dornier Do 217, Junkers Ju 188, or Junkers Ju 388. This version was designed to attack enemy aircraft up to above the launching aircraft.

<doc id="313188" wikidata="Q613051" url="?curid=313188" title="Robert Kocharyan">
<text>Robert Sedraki Kocharyan ( ; born 31 August 1954) is an Armenian politician. He served as the President of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic from 1994 to 1997 and Prime Minister of Nagorno-Karabakh from 1992 to 1994. He served as the second President of Armenia between 1998 and 2008 and as Prime Minister of Armenia from 1997 to 1998.

Kocharyan was elected president of Armenia twice, in 1998 and 2003; both presidential elections were held in two rounds. During most of his presidency, between 2001 and 2007, Armenia&#x27;s economy grew on average by 12% annually, largely due to a construction boom. While Kocharyan&#x27;s supporters credit him with securing Armenia&#x27;s economic growth during his presidency, his critics accuse him of promoting corruption and the creation of an oligarchic system of government in Armenia.

On July 26, 2018 Kocharyan was charged in connection with the crackdown on the 2008 Armenian presidential election protests in the final weeks of his presidency, which resulted in the deaths of ten people. Kocharyan&#x27;s trial began on 13 May 2019. The trial ended in March 2021 after the Constitutional Court of Armenia declared unconstitutional the article of the criminal code under which Kocharyan was being tried.

Kocharyan returned to active participation in Armenian politics following the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020. He participated in the 2021 Armenian parliamentary election as the head of the Armenia Alliance with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and the Reborn Armenia party, which came in second place after Nikol Pashinyan&#x27;s Civil Contract party and entered parliament as the opposition.

== Early life and Nagorno-Karabakh war==
Robert Kocharyan was born on 31 August 1954 in Stepanakert, capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. He received his secondary education in Stepanakert and served in the Soviet Army from 1972 to 1974. Kocharyan&#x27;s career began as an engineer at Stepanakert&#x27;s electro-technical plant in 1971. In 1982, he graduated with honors from the Electro-Technical Department of the Karl Marx Polytechnic Institute in Yerevan (now called the National Polytechnic University of Armenia).
Throughout the 1980s, he occupied various posts in Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s communist youth league and party. At one point he served as deputy secretary of the Stepanakert Komsomol, which was headed by his later successor as president of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan. By February 1988, Kocharyan became one of the leaders of the Karabakh movement as a member of the Krunk (&quot;Crane&quot;) organization. The Karabakh movement, which started in Nagorno-Karabakh then spread to Soviet Armenia, sought to achieve the transfer of the autonomous region from Azerbaijan to Armenia. After the organization broke apart, he founded the Miatsum (&quot;Unification&quot;) organization. In 1989, he was elected to Soviet Armenia&#x27;s Supreme Soviet. In 1991, Kocharyan was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the newly established Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR). Kocharyan became a member of the Pan-Armenian National Movement (then the ruling party of Armenia) and its executive board, representing the party in Nagorno-Karabakh. In January 1992, Kocharyan was a candidate for president of the Supreme Soviet of the NKR, but lost to Artur Mkrtchyan, a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict plunged into all-out war. Kocharyan participated in the Capture of Shusha in May 1992, one of the most significant Armenian victories of the war. In August 1992, Kocharyan became chairman of the State Defense Committee of the NKR, an extraordinary body which held all executive powers during the war. That year he also became prime minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Kocharyan coordinated the war effort of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in its war against Azerbaijan, which ended in an Armenian victory with the signing of a ceasefire agreement in May 1994 by representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan and the NKR. Kocharyan was elected NKR&#x27;s first president on 24 December 1994 by the decision of the NKR Supreme Soviet. He was reelected by popular vote in November 1996.

==Prime Minister of Armenia==
On 20 March 1997, Kocharyan left his post as President of the NKR when he was appointed Prime Minister of Armenia by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. In February 1998, President Ter-Petrosyan was forced to step down by Kocharyan, Defense Minister Vazgen Sargsyan, and Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan, who were opposed to Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s move to accept a peace plan for Karabakh put forward by international mediators in September 1997. The plan, accepted by Ter-Petrosyan and Azerbaijan, called for a &quot;phased&quot; settlement of the conflict which would postpone an agreement on Karabakh&#x27;s status. The first phase of the agreement envisioned the return of most Armenian-controlled Azerbaijani territories around Karabakh in exchange for security guarantees, demilitarization of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territories, and the lifting of the Azerbaijani and Turkish blockades of Armenia.

==President of Armenia==

After his predecessor Levon Ter-Petrosyan was ousted as President, Kocharyan was elected Armenia&#x27;s second President on 30 March 1998, defeating his main rival, Karen Demirchyan (who was a former leader of Soviet Armenia), in an early presidential election marred by irregularities and violations by both sides as reported by international electoral observers. There were also complaints that Kocharyan was not eligible to run under the Armenian constitution, which required candidates to be an Armenian citizen and have resided in Armenia for ten years. Before he became prime minister, Kocharyan resided in and was considered a citizen of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Kocharyan was supported by Vazgen Sargsyan&#x27;s Republican Party, as well as the banned Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which he relegalized early in his presidency.

After their coalition won a majority of seats in parliamentary elections in May 1999, Vazgen Sargsyan took the office of prime minister while Karen Demirchyan became speaker of the parliament. On 27 October 1999, Vazgen Sargsyan and Karen Demirchyan were killed along with six other government officials by five gunmen in an episode known as the 1999 Armenian parliament shooting. The attackers then took around fifty people hostage in the parliament building. Kocharyan himself negotiated with the terrorists to release the hostages and surrender to police. Kocharyan and his ally Serzh Sargsyan, who was minister of national security at the time of the shooting, have been suspected of covering up or even masterminding the attack in order to consolidate political power by their political opponents and some relatives and supporters of the assassinated officials. The possibility of Kocharyan&#x27;s involvement in the events was considered during the investigation in 2000; although several individuals close to Kocharyan were arrested, they were released months later, and no evidence was found implicating Kocharyan or anyone besides the five attackers in the shooting. Kocharyan&#x27;s predecessor Levon Ter-Petrosyan repeatedly accused him and Serzh Sargsyan of being complicit in the 1999 shooting in his campaign speeches before the 2008 presidential election.

In 2001 Kocharyan was attending a jazz performance at Poplavok cafe in Yerevan, and was greeted by former classmate Poghos Poghosyan with the words &quot;Hi Rob&quot;. The casualness of the greeting was taken as an insult, and Kocharyan&#x27;s bodyguards took Poghosyan into the café toilet and killed him. The bodyguard, Aghamal Harutiunyan, received a one-year suspended jail term for the killing.

===2003 election===

The 2003 Armenian Presidential election was held on 19 February and 5 March 2003. No candidate received a majority in the first round of the election with the incumbent President Kocharyan winning slightly under 50% of the vote. Therefore, a second round was held and Kocharyan defeated Stepan Demirchyan (son of Karen Demirchyan) with official results showed him winning just over 67% of the vote.

In both rounds, electoral observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe reported significant amounts of electoral fraud by Demirchyan&#x27;s supporters and numerous supporters of Demirchyan were arrested before the second round took place. Demirchyan described the election as having been rigged and called on his supporters to rally against the results. Tens of thousands of Armenians protested in the days after the election against the results and called on President Kocharyan to step down. However Kocharyan was sworn in for a second term in early April and the constitutional court upheld the election, while recommending that a referendum be held within a year to confirm the election result.
On April 14, 2004 Armenian poet Silva Kaputikyan wrote an open letter &quot;Kocharyan Must Go&quot;, where she protested Kocharyan&#x27;s harsh methods towards the demonstrators on April 12–13, 2004. She also turned back Mesrop Mashtots Medal awarded by Kocharyan some years ago.

===2008 election===

A presidential election was held in Armenia on 19 February 2008. The incumbent President Kocharyan, who was ineligible for a third consecutive term, backed the candidacy of Prime Minister of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan.

Following the election result, protests organized by supporters of unsuccessful candidate Levon Ter-Petrosyan began in Yerevan&#x27;s Freedom Square and accompanied by mass disorders. The opposition accused the government of rigging the election in Sargsyan&#x27;s favor. On March 1, the demonstrators were dispersed by police and military forces. Ten people (eight protestors and two policemen) were killed during clashes between police and protestors, and President Kocharyan declared a 20-day state of emergency. This was followed by mass arrests and purges of prominent members of the opposition, as well as a de facto ban on any further anti-government protests.

===Foreign policy=== 
As President, Kocharyan continued to negotiate a peaceful resolution with Azerbaijani Presidents Heydar Aliyev and Ilham Aliyev on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Kocharyan was generally in favor of achieving a &quot;package deal&quot; settlement of the conflict, whereby all issues, including the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh would be resolved in one agreement, rather than a &quot;phased&quot; settlement whereby Armenian forces would withdraw from the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh in exchange for security guarantees while Karabakh&#x27;s status would be left for future negotiations. In October 1999, Kocharyan became the first President of Armenia to visit Azerbaijan, holding talks with Heydar Aliyev at the border of the two countries. Kocharyan and Heydar Aliyev reportedly came particularly close to an agreement during US-mediated negotiations at Key West in April 2001. In his memoirs, Kocharyan later claimed that Aliyev stood ready in his discussions to recognize Karabakh as a part of Armenia.

Talks between Kocharyan and Ilham Aliyev, Heydar Aliyev&#x27;s son and successor, were held in September 2004 in Astana, Kazakhstan, on the sidelines of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit. Reportedly, one of the suggestions put forward was the withdrawal of Armenian forces from the Azeri territories adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh, and holding referendums (plebiscites) in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan proper regarding the future status of the region. On 10–11 February 2006, Kocharyan and Aliyev met in Rambouillet, France to discuss the fundamental principles of a settlement to the conflict, including the withdrawal of troops, formation of international peacekeeping troops, and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.

During the weeks and days before the talks in France, OSCE Minsk Group co-chairmen expressed cautious optimism that some form of an agreement was possible. French President Jacques Chirac met with both leaders separately and expressed hope that the talks would be fruitful. Contrary to the initial optimism, the Rambouillet talks did not produce any agreement, with key issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh and whether Armenian troops would withdraw from Kalbajar still being contentious. The next session of the talks was held in March 2006 in Washington, D.C. Russian President, Vladimir Putin applied pressure to both parties to settle the disputes. Later in 2006 there was a meeting of the Armenian and Azerbaijani Presidents in Minsk on 28 November and ministerial meetings were held in Moscow. &quot;These talks did not initiate any progress, but I hope that the time for a solution will come&quot; said Peter Semneby, EU envoy for the South Caucasus.

In September 2006, in his congratulatory message on the occasion of 15th anniversary of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Kocharyan said &quot;The Karabakhi people made their historic choice, defended their national interests in the war that was forced upon them. Today, they are building a free and independent state.&quot; The accompanying message said that the duty of the Republic of Armenia and all Armenians is to contribute to the strengthening and development of Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as to the international recognition of the republic&#x27;s independence.

== Post-presidency ==

===Arrest===
On 26 July 2018, the Special Investigative Service (SIS) of Armenia charged Kocharian with “overthrowing constitutional order of Armenia” during the final weeks of his presidency. The SIS asked a Yerevan court to remand him in pre-trial custody. 

On 27 July 2018, he was arrested. On 13 August 2018, Kocharyan was freed from custody following a court ruling, but remained accused of the charges he was arrested for. On 7 December 2018, Kocharyan was arrested again following another ruling by the Court of Appeals. 

In 2019, all Kocharyan&#x27;s assets and property, other than his pension, were frozen by the court. On 18 May 2019, Kocharyan was freed on bail from pre-trial detention. On 25 June 2019, he was arrested for the third time. He was again released a year later, on 18 June 2020, on bail.

=== Second Nagorno-Karabakh War and aftermath ===
During the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Kocharyan met with fellow ex-presidents of Armenia Levon Ter-Petroysan and Serzh Sargsyan as well as ex-presidents of Nagorno-Karabakh Arkadi Ghukasyan and Bako Sahakyan to discuss the situation. In October 2020, Kocharyan and Ter-Petrosyan requested that Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan give them permission to go to Moscow as special negotiators. Pashinyan accepted their request to go to Moscow to meet with Russian officials, but not as official negotiators. The visit never occurred as Kocharyan tested positive for COVID-19.

After the defeat of the Armenian side in the war and the signing of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement, Kocharyan joined other ex-presidents and opposition politicians in calling for Nikol Pashinyan&#x27;s resignation. He declared his support for Vazgen Manukyan, who was nominated by a coalition of 17 opposition parties, known as the Homeland Salvation Movement (which includes the Republican Party), to lead an interim national unity government. In January 2021, Kocharyan declared his intention to participate in the next elections. 

In March 2021, the Constitutional Court of Armenia ruled that criminal case against Kocharyan must be dropped as the article of the Criminal Code under which he is being prosecuted (Article 300.1) runs counter to two articles of the country&#x27;s constitution. This ruling cannot be overturned.

On 7 May 2021, Kocharian confirmed his intention to participate in the June 2021 snap parliamentary elections as part of a political alliance with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and the Reborn Armenia party. The alliance was named Armenia Alliance and was led by Kocharyan. He lost the elections to Nikol Pashinyan and his Civil Contract party, with the election results showing the Armenia Alliance party had come in second with 21% of votes. After the conclusion of the election, Kocharyan and the Armenia Alliance party contested the votes and demanded an investigation into claims of voter fraud. Kocharyan declined to take his seat in the National Assembly and continues to lead the Armenia Alliance outside of parliament.

==Views==
Robert Kocharyan has long supported Armenia&#x27;s close ties with Russia and considers Vladimir Putin a friend and ally. In a 2019 article in Sputnik-Armenia, he praised Russia&#x27;s emerging role in global politics and was harshly critical of what he described as a pro-Western government following the 2018 Armenian revolution:

Kocharyan suggests that relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan have further strengthened in recent years, &quot;becoming a cornerstone in the context of the revived pan-Turkist aspirations, which pose a direct threat to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh&quot;.

After Armenia&#x27;s defeat, he calls for &quot;full integration&quot; with Russia and gives his support for Armenia to join Russian-led Union State.

== Personal life ==

He and his wife, Bella Kocharyan, have three children: Sedrak, Gayane, and Levon, all of whom were born in Stepanakert. In addition to his native Armenian, Kocharyan speaks Russian and English. In his memoirs that were published in 2020, he admitted to having a poor command of standard Armenian, saying that he &quot;had difficulties with writing and reading in Armenian&quot;. He attributes this to his homeland of Karabakh, where many local Armenians speak the local Karabakh dialect or Russian as their first language. Although he was baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church by Archbishop Pargev Martirosyan in 1996, he has stated that he is not a believer.

<text>Lee Chang-ho (; born 29 July 1975) is a South Korean Go player of 9-dan rank.

==Biography==
He was born in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, South Korea. He turned professional in 1986 at the young age of 11. By the early 1990s, he started winning titles that his teacher, Cho, had previously won. In 1992, Lee won his first international title, the 3rd Tong Yang Cup. Lee has won all of the international Go tournaments at least twice, excluding the World Oza and Ing Cup, which are held every two and four years respectively. In 2006, Lee won the Wangwi title for the eleventh consecutive year.

==Go career==
Over the years, Lee&#x27;s style of play has been broken down. Even Cho Chikun said that Lee Sedol would eventually pass Chang-ho because Chang-ho&#x27;s style is no longer guaranteed due to the new generation of players. When asked if Lee&#x27;s era was over, his teacher Cho Hunhyun simply replied, &quot;No&quot;. He continued, saying that Lee Sedol is just someone who has finally fit the description of a rival for Chang-ho. He also said that both will battle many times and in the coming years the &quot;smoke will settle&quot; and one of them will come out on top.

==Personal life==
Lee married the former amateur Go player Lee Do-yoon on 28 October 2010. Their daughter was born on 8 March 2012.

==Titles and runners-up==
Ranks #2 in total number of titles in Korea and #1 in international titles.

<doc id="313190" wikidata="Q7242396" url="?curid=313190" title="Preventive maintenance checks and services">
<text>Preventive maintenance checks and services (PMCS) in the United States Army or preventive maintenance inspections (PMI) in the United States Air Force are the checks, services, and maintenance performed before, during, and after any type of movement or before the use of all types of military equipment.

== Description ==

Most pieces of military equipment have PMCS charts used to go over every detail needed or noted to ensure the proper function of every mechanical item or non-mechanical surface. A PMCS check is required before, during, and after a piece of equipment or vehicle is used. Checks are also done at weekly, monthly, semi-annual, annual, or bi-annual intervals, depending on the specific part.

Doing a PMCS check every time equipment is used may reduce the number of failures. This reduces the number of injuries during training exercises, improve effectiveness in combat, and increase the operator&#x27;s ability to implement their equipment.

A PMCS is required before a vehicle can be dispatched and before a piece of equipment, such as a weapon, can be issued. A PMCS sheet, as listed above, for vehicles is called a DA 5988E. This sheet is used to write down any deficiency found during the PMCS procedure. The steps taken to perform the PMCS are explained in a Technical Manual and performed by the operator. A PMCS is also used at the unit level.

<doc id="313191" wikidata="Q3224638" url="?curid=313191" title="The Sparrow (novel)">
<text>The Sparrow (1996) is the first novel by author Mary Doria Russell.
It won the Arthur C. Clarke Award, James Tiptree Jr. Award, Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis and the British Science Fiction Association Award. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Children of God&quot;, in 1998. The title refers to Gospel of Matthew 10:29–31, which relates that not even a sparrow falls to the earth without God&#x27;s knowledge thereof.

== Plot ==
In the year 2019, the SETI program at Arecibo Observatory discovers radio broadcasts of music from the vicinity of Alpha Centauri. The first expedition to Rakhat, the world that is sending the music, is organized by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), known for its missionary, linguistic and scientific activities since the time of its founder, Ignatius of Loyola. In the year 2060, only one of the crew, the Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, survives to return to Earth, and he is damaged physically and psychologically. The story is told with parallel plot lines, interspersing the journey of Sandoz and his friends to Rakhat with Sandoz&#x27;s experiences upon his return to Earth.

Father Sandoz is a talented Puerto Rican linguist. He is described as of mixed Taíno and Conquistador heritage and character. Sandoz grew up in La Perla, a poor neighborhood in San Juan. He joined the Jesuits as a teenager. After several stints at Jesuit missionaries around the world, he returns to Puerto Rico. Several of his close friends and co-workers, people with a variety of unique skills and talents, have seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo. One of them, a gifted young technician, was the first to hear the transmissions; another, Sofia Mendes, a Turkish Jewish artificial intelligence specialist, has the connections and aptitude to obtain a spacecraft and help pilot the mission. Sandoz, who has often struggled with his faith, becomes convinced that only God&#x27;s will could bring this group of people with the perfect combination of knowledge and experience together at the moment when the alien signal was detected. Sandoz and his friends, along with three other Jesuit priests, are chosen by the Society of Jesus to travel in secret to the planet, using an interstellar vessel made with a small asteroid.

Upon reaching Rakhat, the crew tries to acclimatize themselves to the new world, experimenting with eating local flora and fauna, then making contact with a rural village, inhabited by a peaceful tribe of herbivore gatherers, the Runa. Though the Runa are clearly not the singers of the radio broadcasts, the Earthlings settle among them and begin to learn their language (Ruanja) and culture. Although Sandoz struggles with his attraction to Sofia, he finds greater spiritual meaning in his interactions with the Runa. The crew transmits all their findings via computer uplink to the asteroid-ship in orbit. One day, in an attempt to retrieve supplies from their landing vehicle for a sick crew member, the landing vehicle runs short of the fuel needed to safely return to the asteroid ship, and the crew must face the reality that they may never return to Earth.

When the Earthlings finally meet a member of the culture that produced the radio transmissions, he proves to be of an entirely different species from the rural natives, a Jana&#x27;ata. He is an ambitious merchant named Supaari VaGayjur. Supaari VaGayjur sees in the visitors a possibility to improve his status, while the crew hopes to find an alternative source of fuel in Supaari&#x27;s city, Gayjur. Meanwhile, the crew begins to grow their own food, introducing the concept of agriculture to the villagers. These seemingly innocent actions and accompanying cultural misunderstandings precipitate an outbreak of violence. Though not closely related genetically, the Jana&#x27;ata have evolved by aggressive mimicry to physically resemble the Runa, who are in fact their prey species. The human introduction of agriculture leads to a Runa baby boom which is harvested by the predatory Jana&#x27;ata. The humans are riven with guilt over their misguided action, and most of the crew are killed when defending against the Jana&#x27;ata attack. Only Sandoz and Marc Robichaux survive, and Sandoz endures capture, degradation, and a crisis of faith. Eventually found by Supaari, Sandoz&#x27;s hands are disfigured and rendered useless in a Jana&#x27;ata practice meant to convey the honor and privilege of being dependent on another, a mutilation analogous to the practice of foot binding. The mutilation kills the other surviving crew member; Sandoz survives, though he is physically and spiritually traumatized, believing himself at fault for the death of his friends. Later, Supaari gives Sandoz to the Reshtar of Galatna, a poet and musician, in exchange for the right to have a wife and start his own lineage. Held captive by the Reshtar, Sandoz realizes the Reshtar is the source of the music that brought the humans to Rakhat and momentarily regains his faith; however, the Reshtar is only interested in Sandoz as a pet who is forced to sexually satisfy the musician, along with his friends and colleagues. It is later revealed that the Reshtar broadcasts songs about his sexual exploits, songs which may have been heard on Earth.

When Sandoz returns to Earth in 2060, his friends are dead, and his faith, once considered worthy of canonization by his superiors, has turned into bitter anger with the god who inspired him to go to Rakhat. Due to relativistic space-time effects, decades had passed while he has been gone, during which popular outrage at the United Nations&#x27; initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, 
especially Sandoz&#x27;s role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered, nearly extinct. The Jesuits shelter Sandoz from the media and help him recover physically, while the Father Superior selects a panel of Jesuit priests from around the world to help Sandoz come out of his shell and explain what really happened. Initially bent on discovering the truth, the other priests eventually recognize the great personal cost at which the journey came, and accept Sandoz&#x27;s epic struggle with his faith. Over the course of several months, Sandoz painfully explains his story and begins his personal healing.

== Similarities to other works ==
&quot;The Sparrow&quot; is similar to James Blish&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;A Case of Conscience&quot;. It also involves a Jesuit priest confronting an alien civilization. Mary Doria Russell has addressed this speculation:

==Literary significance and reception==
Nancy Pearl, in an article in &quot;Library Journal&quot; about book-club recommendations published five years after &quot;The Sparrow&quot; came out, felt that this book was mistakenly categorized as science fiction, and that it is really &quot;a philosophical novel about the nature of good and evil and what happens when a man tries to do the right thing, for the right reasons and ends up causing incalculable harm&quot;.

However, Pearl&#x27;s comment about categorization as science fiction is at odds with the author&#x27;s own assessment. In &quot;Jesuits in Space,&quot; her afterword to the 20th-anniversary edition of &quot;The Sparrow,&quot; Russell repeatedly refers to the book as science fiction, and writes, &quot;At the heart of religion, and at the heart of anthropology, and at the heart of science fiction, there are similar concerns, though there are differences in the kinds of stories we tell and the conclusions that we reach.&quot; It&#x27;s also worth noting that &quot;every&quot; award (see next section) won by &quot;The Sparrow&quot; was specifically a science-fiction award.

In the Catholic journal &quot;Commonweal&quot;, Paul Q. Kane writes that Russell has done her research on the early historic Jesuit missions and on Jesuit spirituality. He continues that she is successfully updating the stories of other important Jesuits who have sent men to distant lands or went themselves to foreign cultures to represent Christianity. &quot;Russell subtly raises concerns about the ways in which sophisticated cultures tell themselves cover stories in order to justify actions taken at a terrible cost to others&quot;. This is also reflected in the way that Sofia has to buy her freedom from what she describes as an institution of intellectual prostitution; as well as the differences between the simple &quot;Runa&quot; who live in the countryside and the &quot;Jana&#x27;ata&quot;, who are the sophisticated city dwellers that created the beautiful music which triggered the mission originally.

== Awards and nominations ==
* The 1996 James Tiptree, Jr. Award
* The 1998 Arthur C. Clarke Award
* The 1998 BSFA Award for Best Novel
* The 1998 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer
* The 2001 Kurd Laßwitz Award
* The 2001 Gaylactic Spectrum Hall of Fame (&quot;The Sparrow&quot; and &quot;Children of God&quot; together)

== Film, television and theatrical adaptations ==
In March 2006 it was announced that Warner Bros. had purchased the rights to &quot;The Sparrow&quot; for Brad Pitt&#x27;s production company, Plan B, and that Pitt himself would be playing the role of Sandoz with screenwriter Michael Seitzman adapting the novel to film.

Since then, Mary Russell has revoked all film rights, believing that Hollywood cannot and will not make a film version of &quot;The Sparrow&quot; that is faithful to the book. She has written her own screenplay with her assistant Karen Hall, but has realized it has little to no chance of being produced.

In 2014, AMC announced it was developing a television adaptation of the book.

In 2021, Scott Frank announced his plans to adapt &quot;The Sparrow&quot; as a miniseries, to be presented on FX. Johan Renck is being looked at to direct, with Frank, Renck, and Mark Johnson signed on as executive producers.

<text>Peters Ice Cream is an Australian ice cream brand, now a subsidiary of European food firm Froneri. It was originally developed by an expatriate American, Frederick (Fred) Augustus Bolles Peters in 1907, using his mother&#x27;s recipe.

== History ==
The company was established in 1907 at Paddington, New South Wales as the &quot;Peters&#x27; American Delicacy Company&quot;. New works to manufacture &#x27;The Health food of a Nation&#x27; was opened at neighbouring Redfern in 1923. Business flourished, in 1927 he set up Peters&#x27; Arctic Delicacy Co. Ltd in Brisbane and a branch in Newcastle; followed by, in 1929, associated companies were established in Victoria, Western Australia and at Townsville with manufacturing branch at Queensland. Peters was largely responsible for introducing to Australia the small refrigerated cabinet, which he hired out to retailers. The red and cream corporate identity was adopted in New South Wales and Queensland, whilst green and cream were used in Victoria and Western Australia . The hub of the company, in Australia was a food firm known as Petersville Australia Limited, in the Melbourne suburb of Mulgrave, which later became the factory, which remains the production centre for most of its ice-cream products.

The company was taken over by Adelaide Steamship Company (AdSteam) in the late 1980s, and then by Pacific Dunlop (now known as Ansell) upon AdSteam&#x27;s collapse. Pacific Dunlop sold its food assets in the mid-1990s, and the ice-cream division was acquired by Nestlé, which continued to market brands including Choc-Wedge, Drumstick, and Monaco Bar.

Ownership of a separate Peters Ice Cream business in Western Australia passed as part of Peters and Brownes (PB) Foods to Fonterra in 2006 and to Nestlé in 2009, giving Nestlé nationwide control of the brand. Formerly, Peters in Western Australia exported ice-creams to Japan where it was called Lady Borden, and New Zealand where it was called Tip Top. Since 2009, Peters ice-creams have been trucked into WA from Melbourne, but the former PB Balcatta factory still produces Cadbury ice cream.

In 2012, The Peters Ice Cream business, including its Mulgrave factory, was purchased by Pacific Equity Partners (PEP), with licence to produce sub-brands that were retained by Nestlé, e.g., Drumstick. In May 2014, the European company R&amp;R Ice Cream bought Peters.

On April 19, 2018, the transaction to create Froneri, a joint venture between the owner of R&amp;R Ice Cream, PAI Partners and Nestlé was completed.

<doc id="313195" wikidata="Q2613381" url="?curid=313195" title="Ashley Wilkes">
<text>George Ashley Wilkes is a fictional character in Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and the 1939 film of the same name. The character also appears in the 1991 book &quot;Scarlett&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; written by Alexandra Ripley, and in &quot;Rhett Butler&#x27;s People&quot; (2007) by Donald McCaig.

==Fictional biography==
Wilkes was born in 1840, being twenty-one at the start of the novel. He is the man with whom Scarlett O&#x27;Hara is obsessed. Gentlemanly yet indecisive, he loves Scarlett, but finds he has more in common with Melanie, his first cousin and later his wife. However, he is tormented by his attraction to Scarlett. Unfortunately for him and Scarlett, his failure to deal with his true feelings for her ruins any chance she has for real happiness with Rhett Butler. Wilkes is a complicated character. He is not sympathetic to the cause of the North. However, he isn&#x27;t an ardent Confederate patriot, either. What he loves about the South is the serene, peaceful life that he and his dear ones know at Twelve Oaks and similar plantations. At one point after the war he comments to Scarlett that &quot;had the war not come he would have spent his life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.&quot;

In short, Wilkes loves the South, but not necessarily the Confederacy. He hates war, telling his friends at the beginning of the book that &quot;most of the misery in the world has been caused by war&quot;, though he fights because of his loyalty to the above-mentioned peaceful life he had in Georgia. Ashley serves as an officer in Cobb&#x27;s Legion.

There is a sense in which the end of Ashley&#x27;s life (as he knew it) is more than just the burning of Twelve Oaks. The four Tarleton brothers (Boyd, Tom, Brent and Stuart) are all killed, three of them at Gettysburg. Cade Calvert returns home terminally ill from tuberculosis. Little Joe Fontaine is killed in battle, and Tony Fontaine has to flee forever to Texas after killing a Yankee (specifically, Scarlett&#x27;s family&#x27;s former slave overseer, Jonas Wilkerson, during Reconstruction; after Wilkerson encouraged a former slave to attempt to rape Tony&#x27;s sister-in-law). These were Wilkes&#x27; childhood friends, all represented in the happy scene at the barbecue, close to the beginning of the book. When the &quot;family circle&quot; of the county is decimated, the life he loved is gone.

At one point in the book Wilkes pleads, in vain, with his wife Melanie to move to the North, after he comes back from fighting in the war. This isn&#x27;t, however, because of any affection for the North, but because he wants to be able to stand on his own as a man, something he will never again be able to do in Georgia now that his plantation is gone and his home burned. However, he ends up working for Scarlett due to her manipulative entreaties and Melanie&#x27;s naive support of her. Melanie also states that if they move to New York, Beau will not be able to go to school. This is because in New York black children are allowed to attend class, and they could not permit Beau to attend class with black children. In Georgia the schools were segregated by race, so Beau would be able to attend school if they remained in the South.

==Role==
Wilkes is the character best personifying the tragedy of the Southern upper class after the Civil War. Coming from a privileged background, he is an honorable and educated man. This is in clear contrast to Rhett Butler, who is decisive and full of life. Rhett is both ruthless and practical, and willing to do whatever he must to survive. In contrast, Wilkes is often impractical (even Melanie admits this on her deathbed), and would resist doing many things Rhett would do because they aren&#x27;t &quot;proper&quot; or &quot;gentlemanly&quot;. Wilkes fights in the Civil War, but he does it out of love for his homeland and not a hatred of the Yankees, who he actually hopes will just leave the South in peace. As a soldier he shows enough leadership to be promoted to the rank of Major, and survives being imprisoned at the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois (a notorious prisoner-of-war camp) for several months. He eventually returns home, still able-bodied. Ashley could have lived a peaceful and respectable life had the War never taken place. The War that changed the South forever has turned his world upside down, with everything he had believed in &#x27;gone with the wind&#x27;, a phrase composed by the poet Ernest Dowson.

<text>Cho Hunhyun (; born 10 March 1953) is a South Korean professional Go player and politician. Considered one of the greatest players of all time, Cho reached professional level in Korea in 1962. Since then, Cho has amassed 150 professional titles, more than any other player in the world. He thrice held all of the open tournaments in Korea in 1980, 1982 and 1986. Cho has also won 11 international titles, third most in the world behind Lee Chang-ho (21) and Lee Sedol (18). He reached 1,000 career wins in 1995.

== Early life (1962–1982) ==
Cho began learning Go at the age of four and passed the test for becoming a professional in 1962. In 1963, Cho was invited to Japan. Originally intended to study under Minoru Kitani, Kensaku Segoe took Cho under his tutelage. Segoe was responsible for bringing Go Seigen to Japan and also teaching Utaro Hashimoto, founder of the Kansai Ki-in. Cho was considered a 2 dan professional in Korea, but was demoted to 4 kyu upon arriving in Japan.

Cho passed the Nihon Ki-in professional exam three years later and became the first player to hold professional certificates from two Go associations. It was at this time when Cho was introduced to Hideyuki Fujisawa. Fujisawa began mentoring Cho, and the two kept a friendly relationship between each other until Fujisawa&#x27;s death in 2009. Cho participated in some Japanese tournaments, finishing runner-up to Takaho Kojima in the 3rd Shin-Ei tournament. In 1972, Cho returned to Korea to begin mandatory military service. Cho won his first title in 1973, defeating Kim In in the 14th Chaegowi. That same year, Cho lost his first title to rival Seo Bongsoo in the 6th Myungin. Since 1973, Cho and Seo have met 65 times in the finals of tournaments, with Cho winning 53 of them. Their most recent title match-up came in the 1st Daejoo Cup in 2010.

Cho continued winning several titles, including the Paewang in 1977, a title he defended sixteen straight times until 1992. In 1980, he held nine titles simultaneously: Guksu, Myungin, Wangwi, Kisung, Paewang, Kiwang, Daewang, Jaewang and the Baccus Cup. Cho repeated this twice, in 1982 and 1986, winning ten and eleven titles respectively. Despite winning several titles, Cho wasn&#x27;t considered the best Korean player at the time. Instead, the media favored Cho Chikun, a Korean-born 9 dan professional in Japan. In 1980, Cho Chikun visited South Korea after winning the Meijin title and the two began a friendship match consisting of two games. The two game series was played on 31 December 1980 and 2 January 1981 with Hunhyun losing both games. From 1991 until Hunhyun&#x27;s loss in the 8th Samsung Cup in 2003, Cho Hunhyun didn&#x27;t lose a match to Cho Chikun.

== First Korean 9 dan (1982–2004) ==
In 1982, Cho was promoted to 9 dan, becoming the first Korean 9 dan. Cho was the sole Korean player invited to the 1st Ing Cup, which featured nine players from the Nihon Ki-in and six players from China. Cho was matched up with Taiwanese-born Japanese professional O Meien in the first round. Cho won the match and went on to defeat Koichi Kobayashi in the quarter-finals. He then met another Taiwanese-born Japanese professional Rin Kaiho in the semi-final. Cho won the best-of-three match in two games and progressed to the final to face Nie Weiping in a best-of-five final. Cho won the first game, but Nie went on to win the next two. The match came down to a fifth and final deciding game, with Cho winning by resignation.

In 1984, Cho began teaching Lee Chang-ho. Two years later, Lee became a professional and began challenging Cho. By 1989, Lee defeated Cho for the first time in a title final by winning the 29th Chaegowi. In 1992, he lost the Paewang title to Lee after defending it for sixteen consecutive years. Their rivalry would continue until 2003, when Lee won the 34th Myungin. As of 16 June 2011, the score between the two in title finals is Lee 47–19 Cho.

== Political career ==
Cho decided to go into politics, joining the Saenuri Party in March 2016. He was elected on the party&#x27;s proportional representation list in the 2016 election, taking seat number 14.

On 5 February 2020, Cho was appointed as the Secretary-General of the newly formed Future Korea Party.

<doc id="313200" wikidata="Q1047667" url="?curid=313200" title="Sun of May">
<text>The Sun of May (Spanish: ) is a national symbol of Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador, appearing on each of their flags.

== History ==
According to Diego Abad de Santillán, the Sun of May represents Inti, the Incan god of the sun.

The specification &quot;of May&quot; is a reference to the May Revolution which took place in the week from 18 to 25 May 1810, which marked the beginning of the independence from the Spanish Empire for the countries that were then part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. A legend claims that as the new government was proclaimed, the sun broke through the clouds, which was seen as a good omen.

== Variations ==
In the flag of Argentina, the Sun of May is the radiant golden yellow sun bearing the human face and thirty-two rays that alternate between sixteen straight and sixteen wavy.

In the flag of Uruguay, the Sun of May is the golden yellow sun bearing the human face and sixteen triangular rays that alternate between eight straight and eight wavy.

Inspired by the Latin American wars of independence, the Philippines, which was a fellow former Spanish colony, also adopted the Sun of May as a revolutionary banner. This later became a faceless sun symbol in the current national flag.

== Description ==
The sun, called the Sun of May, is a replica of an engraving on the first Argentine coin, approved in 1813 by the Constituent Assembly, whose value was eight &quot; (a Spanish currency denomination).

In form, it is similar to—and may be partially derived from—the sun in splendour, which is common in European heraldry. This, too, is usually depicted with a face, and with alternating straight and wavy rays (representing light and heat respectively), though it normally has only sixteen rays.

A 1978 law describing the official ceremonial flag of Argentina specifies that the sun must be golden yellow in color (&quot;), have an inner diameter of 10 cm, and an outer diameter of 25 cm (the diameter of the sun equals the height of the white stripe, and the sun&#x27;s face is of its height), must feature 32 rays (16 undulated and 16 straight in alternation), and must be embroidered in the official ceremonial flag.

<text>Königslutter am Elm is a town in the district of Helmstedt in Lower Saxony, Germany.

==Geography==

It is located on the northeastern slopes of the Elm hill range, within the Elm-Lappwald Nature Park, about east of Brunswick, west of the district capital Helmstedt, and south of Wolfsburg.

The town has access to the Brunswick–Magdeburg railway at the Königslutter railway station, served by Regionalbahn trains to Brunswick and Helmstedt, and is traversed by the Bundesstraße 1 federal highway. The Bundesautobahn 2 runs about north of the town centre. Königslutter is a stop on the German Timber-Frame Road (&quot;Deutsche Fachwerkstraße&quot;) tourist route.

In its current form, the township with about 16,000 inhabitants was created in a 1974 administrative reform by joining the following 18 municipalities:

* Beienrode
* Boimstorf
* Bornum am Elm
* Glentorf
* Groß Steinum
* Klein Steimke
* Königslutter
* Lauingen
* Lelm
* Ochsendorf
* Rhode
* Rieseberg
* Rotenkamp
* Rottorf
* Scheppau
* Schickelsheim
* Sunstedt
* Uhry
==History==

A village called &quot;Lûtere&quot; in the Duchy of Saxony was first mentioned in an 1135 deed, when Emperor Lothair III established a Benedictine monastery here, centered on the Sts Peter and Paul Church, a prominent Romanesque basilica where he and his consort Richenza of Northeim as well as his son-in-law, the Welf duke Henry the Proud are also buried. The place was named after the nearby karst spring of the Lutter (from Middle High German: &quot;lauter&quot;, &quot;pure&quot;) stream in the Elm hills.

A water castle was erected around 1200 and in 1318 the surrounding settlement was documented as a market town. Around 1400 the Dukes of Brunswick granted the citizens of &quot;Luttere&quot; town privileges. From the late 14th century onwards, the place was called &quot;Konnigesluttere&quot;, referring to late Emperor Lothair III, King of the Romans.

Located on the trade route from Brunswick to Magdeburg (the present-day Bundesstraße 1), beer brewing and Elm limestone mining and cutting were its main industries in early modern times, while the monastery developed as a pilgrimage destination. Not until 1924, the monastery complex and the adjacent settlement of &quot;Oberlutter&quot; were incorporated into the town. The monastery church is known for its sculptural art and the tomb of the emperor.

==Politics==

Seats in the town&#x27;s assembly (&quot;Rat&quot;) as of 2011 local elections:
* Christian Democratic Union (CDU): 15
* Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD): 14
* Free Voters: 2
* Free Democratic Party (FDP): 1
* Alliance 90/The Greens: 1
In 2013 the assembly has voted to enter in merger negotiations with neighbouring Wolfsburg.

<doc id="313202" wikidata="Q356502" url="?curid=313202" title="Aristide Cavaillé-Coll">
<text>Aristide Cavaillé-Coll (; 4 February 1811 – 13 October 1899) was a French organ builder. He has the reputation of being the most distinguished organ builder of the 19th century. He pioneered innovations in the art and science of organ building that permeated the profession and influenced the course of organ building, composing and improvising through the early 20th century. 

As the author of scientific journal articles about the organ construction details, he published the results of his research and experiments. 

He was the inventor of the symphonic organ being able to follow smooth and immediate dynamic changes like a symphonic orchestra. 

His most famous organs were built in Paris in Saint-Denis Basilica (1841), Église de la Madeleine, Sainte-Clotilde Basilica (1859), Saint-Sulpice church (his largest instrument; behind the classical façade), Notre-Dame Cathedral (behind the classical façade), baron Albert de L&#x27;Espée&#x27;s residence in Biarritz (moved finally to the Sacré-Cœur Basilica), and many others. The organ reform movement in the 20th century sought to return organ building to a more Baroque style; but since then, Cavaillé-Coll&#x27;s designs have come back into fashion.

== Life ==

Born in Montpellier, France, to Dominique, one in a line of organ builders, he showed early talent in mechanical innovation. He exhibited an outstanding fine art when designing and building his famous instruments. His organs are &quot;symphonic organs&quot;: they can reproduce the sounds of other instruments and combine them as well. 

Cavaillé-Coll was also known for his financial problems - he focused mostly on the organ building art, leaving finance less attention. The art of his handcrafted instruments, unparalleled at that time, was not enough to ensure his firm&#x27;s survival. It was taken over in 1898, shortly before his death, by Charles Mutin, who continued in the organ business, but by the 1940s the firm had almost disappeared.

Cavaillé-Coll died in Paris on 13 October 1899 and is buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery.

==Organ building innovations==
Cavaillé-Coll is responsible for many innovations that revolutionized organ building, performance and composition. Instead of the Positif, Cavaillé-Coll placed the Grand-Orgue manual as the lowest manual, and included couplers that allowed the entire tonal resources of the organ to be played from the &quot;Grand-Orgue&quot;. He refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters, thus increasing the organ&#x27;s potential for expression. 

He adjusted pipe making and voicing techniques, thus creating a whole family of harmonic stops (flutes, trompettes, clairons) and stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe and the english horn. He popularized the harmonic flute stop, which, together with the &quot;montre&quot; (principals), the &quot;gambe&quot; (strings) and the &quot;bourdon&quot; (flutes), formed the &quot;fonds&quot; (foundations) of the organ. He designed the &quot;orchestral quartet&quot; which referred to orchestral four colours of sound - principals, flutes, strings and reeds. 

He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils. These allowed the use of higher wind pressures and for each manual&#x27;s &quot;anches&quot; (reed stops) to be added or subtracted as a group by means of a pedal. Higher wind pressures allowed the organ to include many more stops of 8&#x27; (unison) pitch in every division, so complete &quot;fonds&quot; as well as reed choruses could be placed in every division, designed to be superimposed on top of one another. Sometimes he placed the treble part of the compass on a higher pressure than the bass, to emphasize melody lines and counteract the natural tendency of small pipes (especially reeds) to be softer.

For a mechanical tracker action and its couplers to operate under these higher wind pressures, pneumatic assistance provided by the Barker lever was required, which Cavaillé-Coll included in his larger instruments. This device made it possible to couple all the manuals together and play on the full organ without expending a great deal of effort. 

He also invented the pneumatic combination action system for his five-manual organ at Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris. 

All these innovations allowed a seamless crescendo from &quot;pianissimo&quot; all the way to &quot;fortissimo&quot;, something never before possible on the organ. His organ at the Basilique Ste-Clotilde, Paris (proclaimed a basilica by Pope Leo XIII in 1897) was one of the first to be built with several of these new features. Consequently, it influenced César Franck, who was the titular organist there. The organ works of Franck have inspired generations of organist-composers who came after him.

== Legacy ==
Featuring 102 stops and five manuals, the Saint-Sulpice instrument, which unlike many others remains practically unaltered, is a candidate to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Marcel Dupré stated that &quot;composing for an orchestra is quite different from composing for an organ... with exception of Master Cavaillé-Coll&#x27;s symphonic organs: in that case one has to observe an extreme attention when writing for such kind of instruments.&quot;

Almost a century beforehand, César Franck had ecstatically said of the modest Cavaillé-Coll instrument at l&#x27;Église St.-Jean-St.-François in Paris with words that summed up everything the builder was trying to do: &quot;Mon nouvel orgue ? C&#x27;est un orchestre !&quot; (&quot;My new organ? It&#x27;s an orchestra!&quot;).

Franck later became organist of a much larger Cavaillé-Coll organ at St Clotilde in Paris. In 1878 Franck was featured recitalist on the four-manual Cavaillé-Coll organ at the Palais du Trocadéro in Paris; this organ was subsequently rebuilt by V. &amp; F. Gonzalez in 1939 and reinstalled in the Palais de Chaillot which replaced the Palais de Trocadéro, then rebuilt in 1975 by Gonzalez-Danion and relocated to the Auditorium Maurice Ravel in Lyon. Franck&#x27;s Trois Pièces were premiered on the Trocadéro organ.

== Film ==
A documentary film titled &quot;The Genius of Cavaillé-Coll&quot; was released in 2012 by Fugue State Films to mark both the 200th anniversary of Cavaillé-Coll&#x27;s birth in 2011 and the 150th anniversary of his organ at St Sulpice. It won the DVD Documentary Award of the BBC Music Awards 2014.

<doc id="313204" wikidata="Q708830" url="?curid=313204" title="Arthur C. Clarke Award">
<text>The Arthur C. Clarke Award is a British award given for the best science fiction novel first published in the United Kingdom during the previous year. It is named after British author Arthur C. Clarke, who gave a grant to establish the award in 1987. The book is chosen by a panel of judges from the British Science Fiction Association, the Science Fiction Foundation, and a third organisation, which is the Sci-Fi-London film festival. The award has been described as &quot;the UK&#x27;s most prestigious science fiction prize&quot;.

Any &quot;full-length&quot; science fiction novel written or translated into English is eligible for the prize, provided that it was first published in the United Kingdom during the prior calendar year. There is no restriction on the nationality of the author, and the publication history of works outside the United Kingdom is not taken into consideration. Books may be submitted for consideration by their publishing company, and, beginning in 2016, self-published titles have been eligible with certain qualifications. An official call for entries is issued to UK publishers every year and members of the judging panel and organisation committee also actively call in titles they would like to see submitted. A title must be actively submitted in order to be considered. The judges form a shortlist of six works that they feel are worthy of consideration, from which they select a winning book. The winner receives an engraved bookend and a prize consisting of a number of pounds sterling equal to the current year, such as £2012 for the year 2012. Prior to 2001, the award was £1000.

During the 36 nomination years, 147 authors have had works nominated, 33 of whom have won. China Miéville has won three times, while Pat Cadigan and Geoff Ryman have won twice each; no other author has won multiple times. Stephen Baxter and Gwyneth Jones have the most nominations, at seven each, and Baxter has the most nominations without winning. Neal Stephenson has won once out of six nominations; Ken MacLeod and Kim Stanley Robinson have also been nominated six times. Paul J. McAuley and Miéville have been nominated five times; McAuley has one win, whereas MacLeod and Robinson have none.

==Winners and nominees==

In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="313206" wikidata="Q2362299" url="?curid=313206" title="Rhett Butler">
<text>Rhett Butler (born 1828) is a fictional character in the 1936 novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell and in the 1939 film adaptation of the same name. It is one of Clark Gable&#x27;s most recognizable and significant roles.

==Role==
Rhett&#x27;s personality is that of a cynical, charming, and mocking philanderer. He frequently declares that he has no honor, though he respects those he considers true gentlemen or ladies. He often thinks the worst of Scarlett, even as he admires and loves her. During their first meeting, he says she is no lady, just as he is no gentleman. He often mocks her attempts to be gentle, kind, or ladylike, believing it doesn&#x27;t suit her, and encourages her scheming ways, even as he despises them. He presents a fickle and dapper front, saying things he doesn&#x27;t mean and causing Scarlett to misunderstand him. His constant, defensive teasing causes her to distrust his true intentions, even when she manages to perceive them. In turn, he does not recognize that Scarlett uses charm and acid to protect herself, rather than out of malicious intent.

As the novel begins, Rhett is first mentioned at the Twelve Oaks Plantation barbecue, the home of John Wilkes and his son Ashley and daughters Honey and India Wilkes. The novel describes Rhett as &quot;a visitor from Charleston&quot;, a black sheep who was expelled from West Point and is not received by any family with a reputation in the whole of Charleston, and perhaps all of South Carolina. He is considerably older than the 16-year-old Scarlett, being about 32-33 at the time, and has made a name for himself as a wealthy scoundrel and professional gambler. Rhett witnesses Scarlett&#x27;s young confession to Ashley at the plantation barbecue and is immediately attracted to her boldness in breaking social conventions and her beauty. Rhett mocks Scarlett over her confession, which causes a lasting negative impression.

After Scarlett is widowed for the first time, Rhett makes significant headway in gaining her favor by showering a depressed and isolated-in-mourning Scarlett with attention, though he tells her he isn&#x27;t going to marry her and keeps her flirtatious advances at arm&#x27;s length. She requests that he help her return to Tara with her family in order to wait out the war. However, partway on the dangerous journey, his convoluted convictions lead him to give her a kiss and a gun before he abandons her on the road in order to enlist in the doomed American Civil War. Following, Scarlett undergoes one of the most significant and traumatizing times in her life without support, facing starvation, disease, and violence as she becomes the sole support for her family.

During the war, Rhett&#x27;s wealth and influence balloon as he acts as a smuggler and blockade runner, often in and out of prison. Southern society marks him as an outsider, though they are occasionally charmed by him. An impoverished and desperate Scarlett seeks him out to request a loan of $300 (equivalent to $ in ) to save Tara, and after leading her in circles to see how much she&#x27;d be willing to debase herself for the funds, including her offering to be his mistress (to which he replies she wouldn&#x27;t be worth that much) reveals he was never going to lend her the money, lacking sufficient liquid assets. Scarlett is furious and humiliated. In response, Scarlett convinces Frank Kennedy, her sister Suellen&#x27;s beau, to marry her instead in order to save her family, since her sister intended to abandon the family and enjoy Frank&#x27;s wealth.

Rhett is upset, since he actually was going to lend her the money once out of prison, and later praises her scheming and ability to steal her newest husband from under her sister&#x27;s nose. During this time, Rhett admires that Scarlett makes ventures as a businesswoman, running and expanding Frank&#x27;s businesses, but deplores her hard-nosed and miserly tactics, which earn her few fans, and does not understand her all-consuming need to hoard money.

Her unladylike and brutal business behavior causes Scarlett to be attacked in shanty town, and when her husband, Frank, dies during a retaliatory Ku Klux Klan raid, Rhett saves Ashley Wilkes and several others by alibiing them to the Yankee captain, a man with whom he has played cards on several occasions. Though he blames her for the death of her husband, Rhett laughs at Scarlett&#x27;s sincere fears that she&#x27;s going to hell for her role in Frank&#x27;s life and death, and proposes to the newly-widowed Scarlett, saying he always knew he&#x27;d have her, one way or another, and she should marry him for fun and their physical compatibility.

Scarlett agrees, though only for his money. In the novel, Rhett&#x27;s fortune is estimated at $50,000,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). Rhett secretly hopes that Scarlett will eventually return the love he&#x27;s had since the day he saw her at Twelve Oaks. But, Rhett is also determined not to show Scarlett he loves her, believing those who love Scarlett become wretched, and the pair have volcanic arguments from the start of their marriage.

Rhett&#x27;s jealousy over Scarlett&#x27;s continuing affection for Ashley Wilkes becomes a problem for the couple, however, as well as their low opinions of each other. Scarlett does not view Rhett as a gentleman or good person and resents that he does not see her as a lady. She does not believe or trust that he loves her, and often uses her idealized infatuation with the gentlemanly Ashley Wilkes to comfort herself from the worldly, and frequently flippant, Rhett. Rhett views her money-grubbiness as tacky, loathes the position Ashley continues to play in her heart, and is unable to sway her hardened affections with his sardonic teasing. Still, Rhett completely adores their daughter, Bonnie. Rhett is an infatuated and doting father, showering his daughter with the affection Scarlett will not accept from him, which further isolates him from his wife.

In contrast with his wife, Rhett forms a genuinely warm and fond friendship with Melanie Wilkes, Ashley Wilke&#x27;s wife, and Scarlett&#x27;s only friend, whom he considers a rare, true &#x27;lady&#x27;, and often performs acts of service for her and relies on her for consolation. He also continues his shadier associations, much to Scarlett&#x27;s displeasure and suspicion.

The Butlers&#x27; marriage becomes tattered and eventually wrecked by scandal, the death of their daughter, an accident where Rhett causes Scarlett to tumble down the stairs and miscarry, and the final nail in the coffin, the death of Melanie, Ashley&#x27;s wife. Melanie makes Scarlett promise to care for Ashley after she&#x27;s gone and speaks of how much Rhett loves Scarlett. Rhett, believing Scarlett has never loved him and will jump at the chance to marry the now free and receptive Ashley, becomes apathetic to Scarlett&#x27;s declarations to the contrary. Tired of it all, Rhett walks out of his marriage, seeking to abandon everything to find something left of &quot;charm and grace&quot; in the world.

==Character==
In the course of the novel, Rhett becomes increasingly enamored with Scarlett&#x27;s sheer will to survive in the chaos surrounding the war. The novel contains several pieces of information about him that do not appear in the film. After being disowned by his family (mainly by his father), he became a professional gambler, and at one point was involved in the California Gold Rush, where he ended up getting a scar on his stomach in a knife fight. He seems to love his mother and his sister Rosemary, but has an adversarial relationship with his father which is never resolved. He also has a younger brother who is never named, and a sister-in-law (both of whom he has little respect or regard for), who owns a rice plantation. Rhett is the guardian of a little boy who attends boarding school in New Orleans; it is speculated among readers that this boy is Belle Watling&#x27;s son (whom Belle mentions briefly to Melanie), and perhaps Rhett&#x27;s illegitimate son as well.

Despite being thrown out of West Point, the Rhett of the novel is obviously very well-educated, referencing everything from Shakespeare to classical history to German philosophy. He also has an extensive knowledge of women, both physically and psychologically, which Scarlett does not consider to be &quot;decent&quot; (but nonetheless considers fascinating). Rhett has tremendous respect and gradually gains affection for Melanie as a friend, but very little for Ashley. Rhett&#x27;s understanding of human nature extends to children as well, and he is a much better parent to Scarlett&#x27;s children from her previous marriages than she is herself; he has a particular affinity with her son Wade, even before Wade is his stepson. When Bonnie is born Rhett showers her with the attention that Scarlett will no longer allow him to give to her and is a devoted, even doting and overindulgent, father.

Rhett also decides to join in the Confederate Army but only after its defeat at Atlanta, and when the &quot;cause&quot;, as it were, was clearly understood by a man of his perception to be truly lost. This facet of the character is completely at odds with the worldly and wise predictor of Southern defeat on the eve of hostilities. Rhett has known and believed (and has said so publicly) the South is doomed to lose. And he has risked neither his life nor his fortune for the cause of the South, when to have done so at the beginning of the war might have been worth the risk to establish a new nation.

In both of the official sequels, &quot;Scarlett&quot; (1991) by Alexandra Ripley and &quot;Rhett Butler&#x27;s People&quot; (2007) by Donald McCaig, and in the unofficial &quot;Winds of Tara&quot; by Kate Pinotti, Scarlett succeeds in getting Rhett back.

==Family==
Rhett is the eldest child. In &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; only his younger sister Rosemary is named; his brother and sister-in-law are mentioned very briefly, but not by name. In the sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; by Alexandra Ripley, the Butler parents are called Steven and Eleanor, the younger brother is Ross. In this sequel Rhett marries Anne Hampton after divorcing Scarlett and he reunites with Scarlett only after Anne dies. He and Scarlett have a second daughter called Katie &quot;Cat&quot;.

In the authorized prequel and sequel &quot;Rhett Butler&#x27;s People&quot; his parents are called Langston and Elizabeth, his brother is Julian. In this novel Belle Watling&#x27;s son plays an important role; in the end he is revealed to be another man&#x27;s son even though he believed Rhett was his father.

==Searching for Rhett==
In the 1939 film version of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, for the role of Rhett Butler, Clark Gable was an almost immediate favorite for both the public and producer David O. Selznick (except for Gable himself). But as Selznick had no male stars under long-term contract, he needed to go through the process of negotiating to borrow an actor from another studio. Gary Cooper was thus Selznick&#x27;s first choice, because Cooper&#x27;s contract with Samuel Goldwyn involved a common distribution company, United Artists, with which Selznick had an eight-picture deal. However, Goldwyn remained noncommittal in negotiations.

Warner Bros. offered a package of Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland for the lead roles in return for the distribution rights. When Gary Cooper turned down the role of Rhett Butler, he was passionately against it. He was quoted saying, &quot;&quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I’m glad it’ll be Clark Gable who’s falling flat on his nose, not Gary Cooper&quot;. But by then Selznick was determined to get Clark Gable, and eventually found a way to borrow him from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Selznick&#x27;s father-in-law, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer, offered in May 1938 to fund half of the movie&#x27;s budget in return for a powerful package: 50% of the profits would go to MGM, the movie&#x27;s distribution would be credited to MGM&#x27;s parent company, Loew&#x27;s, Inc., and Loew&#x27;s would receive 15 percent of the movie&#x27;s gross income.

Selznick accepted this offer in August, and Gable was cast. But the arrangement to release through MGM meant delaying the start of production until Selznick International completed its eight-picture contract with United Artists. Gable was reluctant to play the role. At the time, he was wary of potentially disappointing a public who had formed a clear impression of the character that he might not necessarily convey in his performance.

== Adaptations and sequels ==
In the 1939 film adaptation, Rhett was played by Clark Gable. Despite his initial reservations about playing the role, Gable ultimately enjoyed playing the part. His performance is critically acclaimed (as is the film) and is considered the definitive portrayal of the character and he was nominated for Best Actor.

In &quot;Scarlett,&quot; (based on the above sequel novel), Rhett was played by Timothy Dalton.

In the musical production by Takarazuka Revue, Rhett had been played by several top stars of the group, including Yūki Amami (currently a film/TV actress), Yu Todoroki (currently one of the directors of the group) and Yōka Wao (former leading male role of the Cosmos Troupe that retired from the group in July 2006).

Alice Randall&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; is either a parallel historical novel, or (after litigation) a parody. It is told from the slave point of view.

Donald McCaig&#x27;s novel, &quot;Rhett Butler&#x27;s People&quot; is told from Rhett Butler&#x27;s perspective.

In the 2008 Margaret Martin musical &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, the role of Rhett Butler was originated by Darius Danesh.

==Reception==
Michael Sragow of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared Butler to James Bond, arguing that both characters share an analytical sense, are good at seducing &quot;ambivalent&quot; women, and are &quot;masters of maneuvering behind enemy lines&quot;. He also stated that &quot;007&#x27;s erotic quips follow straight from Rhett&#x27;s verbal jousts with Scarlett.&quot;

<text>Jan Zach, called in German Johann Zach (baptized 26 November 1713 – 24 May 1773) was a Czech composer, violinist and organist. Although he was a gifted and versatile composer capable of writing both in Baroque and Classical idioms, his eccentric personality led to numerous conflicts and lack of steady employment from about 1756 onwards.

==Life==
Zach was born in Dehtáry near Brandýs nad Labem, Bohemia into a wheelwright&#x27;s family. In 1724 he moved to Prague and started working as violinist at St Gallus and at St Martín. According to Dlabacž, he studied organ under Bohuslav Matěj Černohorský, who lived in Prague from 1720 to 1727. Zach&#x27;s career as organist started at St Martín, and by 1737 he was also playing the organ at the monastic church of the Merciful Brethren and the Minorite chapel of St Ann. In 1737 he competed for the position of organist at St. Vitus Cathedral, but was not successful. Details of what happened next are unknown: he was reported to have left Bohemia, but apparently remained in Prague at least until 1740. By early 1745 he was living in Augsburg and then on 24 April 1745 he was appointed &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; of the Electoral orchestra at the court of Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein, Prince-Elector of Mainz. He visited Italy in 1746 and, briefly, Bohemia in 1747.

Zach evidently had a complex and eccentric personality, which led to numerous conflicts that plagued his life at Mainz. He was suspended from his position in 1750 and finally dismissed in 1756. From that point on it appears that Zach never again had steady employment. He traveled through Europe and supported himself financially by performing and selling copies of his works, teaching, dedicating his compositions, and so on. He visited numerous courts and monasteries in Germany and Austria, stayed in Italy in 1767 and between 1771 and 1772, and may have worked as choirmaster at the Pairis Abbey in Alsace. He stayed several times at the Stams Abbey at Stams, Tyrol, where he may have had connections, and served as music teacher at the Jesuit school in Munich, for several brief periods of time. The last mentions of Zach in contemporary sources indicate that in January 1773 he was at the Wallerstein court, and according to the Frankfurt &quot;Kayserliche Reichs-Ober-Post-Amts-Zeitung&quot; of 5 June 1773 he died on a journey, at Ellwangen. Zach was buried in the local church of St Wolfgang.

==Works==
A comprehensive list of works has not been completely established. Toward the end of his life, Zach gave numerous compositions to the monks at the Cistercian monastery at Stams. These manuscripts comprise the largest repository of Zach&#x27;s works in the world.

Zach&#x27;s surviving oeuvre comprises a wealth of both instrumental and sacred music: some 30 masses, 28 string sinfonias, a dozen keyboard works and other pieces. Due to the nature of Zach&#x27;s life it is difficult to establish a precise chronology. His work reflects the transition from the old Baroque style to the emerging Classical music era ideals. With multiple influences of the Italian composers, whose music had made it to Prague, trips to Italy, access to the famous textbook of Johann Joseph Fux, &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot;, Czech folk music, and a strong organ technique, Zach was equally adept at strict counterpoint and the &quot;style galant&quot;. In addition, Zach was fond of adventurous chromatic modulations. The scholar Johann Branberger, writing in the early 20th century, noted Zach&#x27;s preference for &quot;chromatic, and often exotic, themes.&quot;

The Harpsichord Concerto in C minor (K C17) exemplifies the transition from the Baroque to Galant style that took place throughout the 18th century. While this particular concerto demonstrates qualities from both styles, it tends more toward the modern. It is in three movements that follow the typical fast - slow - fast format of the Galant Concerti. Although the harmonic minor tonality and austere melody of the opening ritornello is reminiscent of Bach, the tone quickly turns sweeter with the entrance of the second theme. Typical of the Galant style, the harmony moves slowly with the underlying pulse carried by repeated eighth notes. The melodic content often consists of light flourishes in groupings of two or four measures, and the diatonic sequences are short and plain. The Baroque style most often emerges in the keyboard part with complex, chromatic, and virtuosic patterns. Furthermore, the counterpart between keyboard and orchestra is more intricate than what would be normally expected in the Galant style.

Only a few of Zach&#x27;s pieces were published during his lifetime: a harpsichord sonata (in &quot;Oeuvres mêlées&quot;, v/6 (Nuremberg, 1759)), a harpsichord concerto (Nuremberg, 1766; GS C13), and the collection &quot;Sei sonate&quot; for harpsichord and violin or flute (Paris, 1767).

==List of works==
A thematic catalogue of Zach&#x27;s work was published by K.M. Komma in 1938 (K numbers); since then more works were found, and some were catalogued by A. Gottron and W. Senn in 1955 (GS numbers).

<text>The Halifax Resolves was a name later given to the resolution adopted by the North Carolina Provincial Congress on April 12, 1776. The adoption of the resolution was the first official action in the American Colonies calling for independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution. The Halifax Resolves helped pave the way for the presentation to Congress of the United States Declaration of Independence less than three months later.

==Background==
The creation and ratification of the resolves was the result of a strong movement in the colonies advocating separation from Great Britain. These separatists, or &quot;American Whigs&quot; (later, &quot;Patriots&quot;), sought to mobilize public support for a much discussed and all encompassing declaration of independence. The primary impediment to an outright declaration of independence from Great Britain was that none of the delegates to the Second Continental Congress were authorized by their home governments to take any action that would lead to such a declaration. Advocates of independence therefore sought to revise the instructions to each congressional delegation and remove any restrictions regarding a declaration of independence.

==History==
The resolution of April 12, 1776, became known as the Halifax Resolves because the Fourth Provincial Congress of North Carolina adopted them while meeting in the town of Halifax, North Carolina. The 83 delegates present unanimously adopted the resolves, which encouraged delegates to the Continental Congress from all the colonies to finally push for independence. The adoption of the Halifax Resolves was the first official action in the colonies calling for independence from Great Britain.

==Drive to independence==
The Halifax Resolves only empowered North Carolina&#x27;s three delegates to the Second Continental Congress (Joseph Hewes, William Hooper, and John Penn) to join with those from other colonies to declare independence from Great Britain&#x27;s rule.

With the passage of the resolves, North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly permit their delegates to vote in favor of independence. The Halifax Resolves, however, stopped short of instructing North Carolina&#x27;s delegates to introduce a resolution of independence to Congress, a step which was taken by Virginia in June with the adoption of the Lee Resolution The Second Continental Congress issued the United States Declaration of Independence the following month, in July.

==Legacy==
Every year, on April 12, the Halifax Historic District, a historic site operated by the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, celebrates Halifax Day. Interpreters in period costumes provide guided tours of historic buildings, demonstrate historic crafts and teach about colonial activities. Occasionally, reenactors portray revolutionary-era soldiers and demonstrate the use of historic weapons during the Halifax Day events.

<doc id="313216" wikidata="Q212324" url="?curid=313216" title="Autodesk 3ds Max">
<text>Autodesk 3ds Max, formerly 3D Studio and 3D Studio Max, is a professional 3D computer graphics program for making 3D animations, models, games and images. It is developed and produced by Autodesk Media and Entertainment. It has modeling capabilities and a flexible plugin architecture and must be used on the Microsoft Windows platform. It is frequently used by video game developers, many TV commercial studios, and architectural visualization studios. It is also used for movie effects and movie pre-visualization. 3ds Max features shaders (such as ambient occlusion and subsurface scattering), dynamic simulation, particle systems, radiosity, normal map creation and rendering, global illumination, a customizable user interface, and its own scripting language.

== History ==
The original 3D Studio product was created for the DOS platform by the Yost Group, and published by Autodesk. The release of 3D Studio made Autodesk&#x27;s previous 3D rendering package AutoShade obsolete. After 3D Studio DOS Release 4, the product was rewritten for the Windows NT platform, and renamed &quot;3D Studio MAX.&quot; This version was also originally created by the Yost Group. It was released by Kinetix, which was at that time Autodesk&#x27;s division of media and entertainment.

Autodesk purchased the product at the second release update of the 3D Studio MAX version and internalized development entirely over the next two releases. Later, the product name was changed to &quot;3ds max&quot; (all lower case) to better comply with the naming conventions of Discreet, a Montreal-based software company which Autodesk had purchased.

When it was re-released (release 7), the product was again branded with the Autodesk logo, and the short name was again changed to &quot;3ds Max&quot; (upper and lower case), while the formal product name became the current &quot;Autodesk 3ds Max.&quot;

=== Version history ===

== Features ==

=== Non-Destructive Modifiers ===

:One core feature that stands 3ds Max apart from other 3D graphics software is its ability to edit geometry using non-destructive modifiers. Modifiers allow users to make changes to the geometry of an object without permanently altering the original geometry. Instead, the modifications are applied as separate layers on top of the base geometry, which can be easily adjusted or removed without affecting the underlying structure.

=== MAXScript ===
: MAXScript is a built-in scripting language that can be used to automate repetitive tasks, combine existing functionality in new ways, develop new tools and user interfaces, and much more. Plugin modules can be created entirely within MAXScript.

=== Character Studio ===
: Character Studio was a plugin which since version 4 of Max is now integrated in 3ds Max; it helps users to animate virtual characters. The system works using a character rig or &quot;Biped&quot; skeleton which has stock settings that can be modified and customized to fit the character meshes and animation needs. This tool also includes robust editing tools for IK/FK switching, Pose manipulation, Layers and Keyframing workflows, and sharing of animation data across different Biped skeletons. These &quot;Biped&quot; objects have other useful features that help accelerate the production of walk cycles and movement paths, as well as secondary motion.

=== Scene Explorer ===
: Scene Explorer, a tool that provides a hierarchical view of scene data and analysis, facilitates working with more complex scenes. Scene Explorer has the ability to sort, filter, and search a scene by any object type or property (including metadata). Added in 3ds Max 2008, it was the first component to facilitate .NET managed code in 3ds Max outside of MAXScript.

=== DWG import ===
: 3ds Max supports both import and linking of .dwg files. Improved memory management in 3ds Max 2008 enables larger scenes to be imported with multiple objects.

=== Texture assignment/editing ===
: 3ds Max offers operations for creative texture and planar mapping, including tiling, mirroring, decals, angle, rotate, blur, UV stretching, and relaxation; Remove Distortion; Preserve UV; and UV template image export. The texture workflow includes the ability to combine an unlimited number of textures, a material/map browser with support for drag-and-drop assignment, and hierarchies with thumbnails. UV workflow features include Pelt mapping, which defines custom seams and enables users to unfold UVs according to those seams; copy/paste materials, maps and colors; and access to quick mapping types (box, cylindrical, spherical).

=== General keyframing ===
: Two keying modes — set key and auto key — offer support for different keyframing workflows.
: Fast and intuitive controls for keyframing — including cut, copy, and paste — let the user create animations with ease. Animation trajectories may be viewed and edited directly in the viewport.

=== Constrained animation ===
: Objects can be animated along curves with controls for alignment, banking, velocity, smoothness, and looping, and along surfaces with controls for alignment. Weight path-controlled animation between multiple curves, and animate the weight. Objects can be constrained to animate with other objects in many ways — including look at, orientation in different coordinate spaces, and linking at different points in time. These constraints also support animated weighting between more than one target.
: All resulting constrained animation can be collapsed into standard keyframes for further editing.

=== Skinning ===
: Either the Skin or Physique modifier may be used to achieve precise control of skeletal deformation, so the character deforms smoothly as joints are moved, even in the most challenging areas, such as shoulders. Skin deformation can be controlled using direct vertex weights, volumes of vertices defined by envelopes, or both. Capabilities such as weight tables, paintable weights, and saving and loading of weights offer easy editing and proximity-based transfer between models, providing the accuracy and flexibility needed for complicated characters.
: The rigid bind skinning option is useful for animating low-polygon models or as a diagnostic tool for regular skeleton animation.
: Additional modifiers, such as Skin Wrap and Skin Morph, can be used to drive meshes with other meshes and make targeted weighting adjustments in tricky areas.

=== Skeletons and inverse kinematics (IK) ===
: Characters can be rigged with custom skeletons using 3ds Max bones, IK solvers, and rigging tools powered by Motion Capture Data.
: All animation tools — including expressions, scripts, list controllers, and wiring — can be used along with a set of utilities specific to bones to build rigs of any structure and with custom controls, so animators see only the UI necessary to get their characters animated. Four plug-in IK solvers ship with 3ds Max: history-independent solver, history-dependent solver, limb solver, and spline IK solver. These powerful solvers reduce the time it takes to create high-quality character animation. The history-independent solver delivers smooth blending between IK and FK animation and uses preferred angles to give animators more control over the positioning of affected bones. The history-dependent solver can solve within joint limits and is used for machine-like animation. IK limb is a lightweight two-bone solver, optimized for real-time interactivity, ideal for working with a character arm or leg. Spline IK solver provides a flexible animation system with nodes that can be moved anywhere in 3D space. It allows for efficient animation of skeletal chains, such as a character&#x27;s spine or tail, and includes easy-to-use twist and roll controls.

=== Integrated Cloth solver ===
: In addition to reactor&#x27;s cloth modifier, 3ds Max software has an integrated cloth-simulation engine that enables the user to turn almost any 3D object into clothing and even build garments from scratch. Collision solving is fast and accurate even in complex simulations. Local simulation lets artists drape cloth in real time to set up an initial clothing state before setting animation keys.
: Cloth simulations can be used in conjunction with other 3ds Max dynamic forces, such as Space Warps. Multiple independent cloth systems can be animated with their own objects and forces. Cloth deformation data can be cached to the hard drive to allow for nondestructive iterations and to improve playback performance.

=== Integration with Autodesk Vault ===
: Autodesk Vault plug-in, which ships with 3ds Max, consolidates users&#x27; 3ds Max assets in a single location, enabling them to automatically track files and manage work in progress. Users can easily and safely find, share, and reuse 3ds Max (and design) assets in a large-scale production or visualization environment.

=== Max Creation Graph ===
: Introduced with Max 2016, Max Creation Graph (MCG) enables users to create modifiers, geometry, and utility plug-ins using a visual node-based workflow.
: With MCG the user can create a new plug-in for 3ds Max in minutes by simply wiring together parameter nodes, computation nodes, and output nodes. The resulting graph can then be saved in an XML file (.maxtool) or be packaged with any compounds (.maxcompound) it depends on in a ZIP file (.mcg) which can be shared easily with 3ds Max users.

==Adoption ==
Many films have made use of 3ds Max, or previous versions of the program under previous names, in CGI animation, such as &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;2012&quot;, which contain computer generated graphics from 3ds Max alongside live-action acting. Mudbox was also used in the final texturing of the set and characters in Avatar, with 3ds Max and Mudbox being closely related.

3ds Max has been used in the development of 3D computer graphics for a number of video games.

Architectural and engineering design firms use 3ds Max for developing concept art and previsualization.

Educational programs at secondary and tertiary level use 3ds Max in their courses on 3D computer graphics and computer animation. Students in the FIRST competition for 3d animation are known to use 3ds Max.

== Modeling techniques ==
=== Polygon modeling ===

Polygon modeling is more common with game design than any other modeling technique as the very specific control over individual polygons allows for extreme optimization. Usually, the modeler begins with one of the 3ds max primitives, and using such tools as bevel and extrude, adds detail to and refines the model. Versions 4 and up feature the Editable Polygon object, which simplifies most mesh editing operations, and provides subdivision smoothing at customizable levels (see NURMS).

Version 7 introduced the &quot;edit poly&quot; modifier, which allows the use of the tools available in the editable polygon object to be used higher in the modifier stack (i.e., on top of other modifications).

NURBS in 3ds Max is a legacy feature. None of the features have been updated since version 4 and have been ignored by the development teams over the past decade. For example, the updated path deform and the updated normalize spline modifiers in version 2018 do not work on NURBS curves anymore as they did in previous versions.

=== NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational Based-Splines) ===
An alternative to polygons, it gives a smoothed out surface that eliminates the straight edges of a polygon model. NURBS is a mathematically exact representation of freeform surfaces like those used for car bodies and ship hulls, which can be exactly reproduced at any resolution whenever needed. With NURBS, a smooth sphere can be created with only one face.

The non-uniform property of NURBS brings up an important point. Because they are generated mathematically, NURBS objects have a parameter space in addition to the 3D geometric space in which they are displayed. Specifically, an array of values called knots specifies the extent of influence of each control vertex (CV) on the curve or surface. Knots are invisible in 3D space and can&#x27;t be manipulated directly, but occasionally their behavior affects the visible appearance of the NURBS object. Parameter space is one-dimensional for curves, which have only a single U dimension topologically, even though they exist geometrically in 3D space. Surfaces have two dimensions in parameter space, called U and V.

NURBS curves and surfaces have the important properties of not changing under the standard geometric affine transformations (Transforms), or under perspective projections. The CVs have local control of the object: moving a CV or changing its weight does not affect any part of the object beyond the neighboring CVs. (This property can be overridden by using the Soft Selection controls). Also, the control lattice that connects CVs surrounds the surface. This is known as the convex hull property.

=== Surface tool/editable patch object ===
&quot;Surface tool&quot; was originally a 3rd party plugin, but Kinetix acquired and included this feature since version 3.0. The surface tool is for creating common 3ds Max splines, and then applying a modifier called &quot;surface.&quot; This modifier makes a surface from every three or four vertices in a grid. It is often seen as an alternative to &quot;mesh&quot; or &quot;nurbs&quot; modeling, as it enables a user to interpolate curved sections with straight geometry (for example a hole through a box shape). Although the surface tool is a useful way to generate parametrically accurate geometry, it lacks the &quot;surface properties&quot; found in the similar Edit Patch modifier, which enables a user to maintain the original parametric geometry whilst being able to adjust &quot;smoothing groups&quot; between faces.

== Predefined primitives ==
This is a basic method, in which one models something using only boxes, spheres, cones, cylinders and other predefined objects from the list of &quot;Predefined Standard Primitives&quot; or a list of &quot;Predefined Extended Primitives&quot;. One may also apply Boolean operations, including subtract, cut and connect. For example, one can make two spheres which will work as blobs that will connect with each other. These are called metaballs.

== Rendering ==
; Scanline rendering
: The default rendering method in 3ds Max is scanline rendering. Several advanced features have been added to the scanliner over the years, such as global illumination, radiosity, and ray tracing.
; ART Renderer
: Autodesk Raytracer Renderer (ART) is a CPU-only, physically based renderer for architectural, product, and industrial design renderings and animations. It is integrated into 3ds Max as of version 2017.
; Redshift
: A third-party GPU-accelerated, biased renderer with plugins for 3ds Max, Cinema 4D, Houdini, Katana and Maya.
; Mental Ray
: Mental ray is a third-party renderer using bucket rendering, a technique that allows distributing the rendering task for a single image between several computers. Since 3ds Max 2018, mental ray is no longer shipped with 3ds Max and needs to be obtained directly from NVIDIA.
; RenderMan
: A third party connection tool to RenderMan pipelines is also available for those that need to integrate Max into Renderman render farms. Used by Pixar for rendering several of their CGI animated films.
; V-Ray
: A third-party render engine plug-in for 3ds Max.
; Brazil R/S
: A third-party photorealistic rendering system. It is capable of fast ray tracing and global illumination.
; Arion
: A third party hybrid GPU+CPU interactive, unbiased ray tracer, based on Nvidia CUDA.
; Indigo Renderer
: A third-party photorealistic renderer with plugins for 3ds Max.
; Maxwell Render
: A third-party photorealistic rendering system providing materials and unbiased rendering.
; Octane Render
: A third party unbiased GPU ray tracer with plugins for 3ds Max, based on Nvidia CUDA.
; Luxrender
: An open-source ray tracer supporting 3ds Max, Cinema 4D, Softimage, and Blender. Focuses on photorealism by simulating real light physics as much as possible.
; Arnold
: Arnold is an unbiased, physically based, unidirectional path-tracing renderer.
;Corona Renderer
: An third party high-performance (un)biased photorealistic renderer.
; Fstorm Renderer

== Licensing ==
Earlier versions (up to and including 3D Studio Max R3.1) required a special copy protection device (called a dongle) to be plugged into the parallel port while the program was run, but later versions incorporated software based copy prevention methods instead. Current versions require online registration.

Due to the high price of the commercial version of the program, Autodesk also offers a free student version, which explicitly states that it is to be used for &quot;educational purposes only&quot;. The student version has identical features to the full version, but is only for single use and cannot be installed on a network. The student license expires after three years, at which time the user, if they are still a student, may download the latest version, thus renewing the license for another three years.

In 2020, Autodesk had since reduced the free student version limit to 1 year only, as opposed to 3 years previously. In addition, all customers seeking free access to Autodesk educational products and services are required to provide proof of enrollment, employment, or contractor status at a qualified educational institution.

<text>The Ruhrstahl Ru 344 X-4 or Ruhrstahl-Kramer RK 344 was a wire-guided air-to-air missile designed by Germany during World War II. The X-4 did not see operational service and thus was not proven in combat but inspired considerable post-war work around the world, and was the basis for the development of several ground-launched anti-tank missiles.

==History==

During 1943, the RAF&#x27;s Bomber Command and the US Air Force mounted a series of heavy raids against Germany. Despite heavy bomber losses, these prompted &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; research into considerably more powerful anti-bomber weaponry in order to reduce the cost in lost fighter aircraft and aircrew. A massive development effort resulted in a number of heavy-calibre autocannon designs, air-to-air rockets, SAMs, and the X-4.

Work on the X-4 began in June 1943, by Dr Max Kramer at . The idea was to build a missile with enough range to allow it to be fired from outside the range of the bombers&#x27; guns (what is now called a stand-off weapon). The bombers&#x27; defensive guns had a maximum effective range of about . The missile was to be guided with enough accuracy to guarantee a &quot;kill&quot;. The X-4 met these specifications and more. Its BMW 109-448 rocket motor accelerated the missile to over and kept the X-4 at this speed during its &quot;cruise&quot;, between .

The rocket burned a hypergolic mixture of S-Stoff (nitric acid with 5% iron(III) chloride) and R-Stoff (an organic amine-mixture of 50% dimethylaminobenzene and 50% triethylamine called Tonka 250) as propellant, delivering thrust initially, declining to over the 17-second burn. As there was no room for a fuel pump, the fuels were forced into the motor by pistons inside long tubes, the tubes being coiled (similar to a coil spring) to fit inside the airframe. S-Stoff was so corrosive, it dissolved all base metals and was extremely difficult and dangerous to handle. The Germans planned to replace the motor with a solid fuel design as soon as possible.

The missile was spin-stabilized at about 60 rpm, or one rotation a second, so any asymmetrical thrust from the engine or inaccuracies in the control surfaces would be evened out. Signals to operate control surfaces on the tail were sent via two wires (a method chosen to avoid radio jamming), which unwound from bobbins housed within long, bullet-shaped fairings, themselves mounted either on the roots of an opposing pair of the larger mid-body fins (there were four, swept 45°), or on one pair of those same fins&#x27; opposing tips; these contained a total of about of wire. The wires were controlled by a joystick in the cockpit. A gyroscope kept track of &quot;up&quot; so control inputs from the pilot&#x27;s joystick in the launch aircraft could be translated into yaw and pitch as the missile spun. Flares attached to two of the midsection wings were used to keep the missile visible through the smoke of its motor.

The warhead consisted of a fragmentation device that had a lethal radius of about . It was thought that the guidance system would allow the pilot to get the missile into this range in terms of pitch and yaw. But with the ranges the missile could operate at, it would be almost impossible to judge range to the target bomber anywhere near this accuracy. For this reason the missile mounted a proximity fuze known as a &quot;Kranich&quot; (Crane), using an acoustical system tuned to the 200 Hz sound of the B-17&#x27;s engines in cruise, activated by the Doppler shift as the missile approached. The trigger range was .

The first flight test occurred on August 11, 1944, using a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 for the launch platform. Subsequent tests used the Junkers Ju 88 and Messerschmitt Me 262, although they were not launched from the latter. The X-4 had originally been intended for use by single-seat fighters (including the Me 262 and possibly the Dornier Do 335), but the problems in guiding both the missile and the aircraft at the same time proved unworkable. Instead, the X-4 was re-directed to multi-seat aircraft like the Ju 88, while the unguided R4M rocket was to be used in single-seaters.

The X-4 was designed to be easily assembled by unskilled labour and airframe production began in early 1945 incorporating low-cost (non-strategic) materials, such as wood for fins. Production was hampered by Allied bombing of the BMW rocket engine factory at Stargard, though as many as 1,000 X-4s may have been completed, the missile was never officially delivered to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The fighter-interceptor designed to use this missile as its primary weapon was the Focke-Wulf Ta 183 &quot;Huckebein&quot;, which never got out of the project stage.

After the war, French engineers tried to develop a domestic version of the X-4, the Nord SS.10. 200 units were manufactured between 1947 and 1950. However, the program was disbanded due to the dangerous pre-flight refueling involved (the hypergolic nitric acid and Tonka combination was highly explosive).

<text>Bornum am Elm is a village of 919 inhabitants (2021) in the city of Königslutter am Elm, Lower Saxony, Germany. It was a municipality until 1974, when it was joined to Königslutter.

Bornum is near the northern edge of the Elm hills on the bank of the Scheppau stream, at an elevation of 135 meters. Neighboring places are Scheppau, Lauingen, and Abbenrode, as well as Königslutter proper. Industries include farming, tourism, and construction.

Archaeological evidence shows the existence of the village in the Iron Age. The oldest documentary mentioning dates from 1135, when properties in Bornum were given to the newly founded Königslutter Abbey by Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor. The manor of the village was given as a fief to various holders by the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1390, it came to the von Weferlingen family; they sold it to the von Westphalen family in 1764. In 1779, it was bought back by Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who sold it to Amelungsborn Abbey in 1781. Up to the Napoleonic period, the Lord of the Manor had jurisdiction over the village. In 1844 the manor was bought by the farmers in the village and was dissolved.

<text>Schunter is a river in Lower Saxony, Germany. It has a length of and is a right tributary of the Oker.

==Etymology==
The river was first mentioned as &quot;Schuntra&quot; in a 781 deed. The name may be of Slavic origin as &quot;sukątora&quot; means &quot;with many turns&quot; or “meandering.” The name underwent a number of changes throughout its recorded history. In 803, documents show it being called &quot;Scuntra.&quot; In the late 10th century, it was called &quot;Scuntera&quot; and in the early 11th century it was mentioned as &quot;Scuntre.&quot; Mid-17th century documents show a spelling of &quot;Scunter&quot; and then in 1755, it became known as &quot;Schunter.&quot;

==History==
In the middle of the 18th Century, Duke Karl I ordered that the Schunter be made navigable up to the town of Frellstedt. This would make all but about navigable. Much of the original meandering nature was replaced with straightaways with the help of dikes. Its clear spring waters formerly supplied the paper mills of Räbke. In the 18th century it was also used for timber rafting of logs harvested in the Elm range.

==Origin==

The Schunter originates in the northeast Elm hills roughly west of the town of Räbke. Räbke is west of Helmstedt, the capital of the District of Helmstedt.

==Course==
The river begins flowing east through Räbke and Frellstedt before turning north towards Süpplingen. After Süpplingen it continues north passing just west of historic Süpplingenburg. The river then travels northwest past Groß Steinum, Beienrode and Ochsendorf. The river then turns north again and passes under Highway A2 and then on the eastern edge of Glentorf. The river then enters the urban Wolfsburg District. It again turns northwest before passing between Heiligendorf, Hattorf and Beienrode, where it reenters the District of Helmstedt. The river turns west, passing under Highway A39 before entering Flechtorf. Here it passes the partially standing 13th century Campen Castle that was built between the Schunter and a canal built parallel on the north side of the river. After leaving Flechtorf, the river bends sharply south, then passes under the Weddel loop railroad tracks before passing on the north and west side of the town of Lehre. The river continues southwest before entering Wendhausen where it passes Wendhausen Castle, a 17th-century moated castle. Then the river passes again under Highway 2 at Hondelage, before passing Dibbesdorf, Querumer Forst and entering the north side of the Braunschweig urban area. Winding its way through Braunschweig before turning north and passing under Highway 2 the third time, followed by passing under Highway A391 before crossing under the Mittelland Canal. In its final stretch the Schunter passes Thune, heads west past Harxbüttel and just north of Walle before flowing into the Oker River at Schwülper, downstream of Braunschweig.

<doc id="313236" wikidata="Q162075" url="?curid=313236" title="Phytolacca">
<text>Phytolacca is a genus of perennial plants native to North America, South America and East Asia. Some members of the genus are known as pokeweeds or similar names such as pokebush, pokeberry, pokeroot or poke sallet. Other names for species of &quot;Phytolacca&quot; include inkberry and ombú. The generic name is derived from the Greek word (&quot;phyton&quot;), meaning &quot;plant,&quot; and the Latin word &quot;lacca&quot;, a red dye. Phytolaccatoxin and phytolaccigenin are present (in the leaves, stems, roots, blossoms, berries etc.) in many species which are poisonous to mammals if not prepared properly. The berries are eaten by birds, which are not affected by the toxin. The small seeds with very hard outer shells remain intact in the digestive system and are eliminated whole.

The genus comprises about 25 to 35 species of perennial herbs, shrubs, and trees growing from tall. They have alternate simple leaves, pointed at the end, with entire or crinkled margins; the leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen. The stems are green, pink or red. The flowers are greenish-white to pink, produced in long racemes at the ends of the stems. They develop into globose berries diameter, green at first, ripening dark purple to black.

==Selected species==
The following species are accepted by one or more regional floras:
* &quot;Phytolacca acinosa&quot; Roxb. – Indian poke. Southern and eastern Asia (syn. &quot;P. esculenta&quot; Van Houtte, &quot;P. latbenia&quot; (Moq.) Walter). Black and Judziewicz report it in Dane County, Wisconsin in their 2008 and 2009 books (Wildflowers of Wisconsin and the Great Lakes Region. A Comprehensive Field Guide, first and 2nd editions. )
* &quot;Phytolacca americana&quot; L. – American pokeweed. North America (syn. &quot;P. decandra&quot; L.)
* &quot;Phytolacca australis&quot; Phil. – Western South America
* &quot;Phytolacca bogotensis&quot; Kunth – Tropical and subtropical South America (sometimes included in &quot;P. icosandra&quot;).
* &quot;Phytolacca chilensis&quot; Miers – central Chile (possibly synonymous with &quot;P. icosandra&quot;)
* &quot;Phytolacca dioica&quot; L. – Ombú. Subtropical South America.
* &quot;Phytolacca dodecandra&quot; L&#x27;Hér. – Eastern Africa, Madagascar (syn. &quot;P. abyssinica&quot; Hoffm.).
* &quot;Phytolacca heterotepala&quot; H.Walt. – Mexican pokeweed. Mexico.
* &quot;Phytolacca icosandra&quot; L. – Central and South America.
* &quot;Phytolacca japonica&quot; Makino – Eastern Asia (syn. &quot;P. hunanensis&quot; Hand.-Mazz., &quot;P. zhejiangensis&quot; W.T.Fan).
* &quot;Phytolacca octandra&quot; L. – Red inkplant. Subtropical and tropical regions worldwide (sometimes included in &quot;P. icosandra&quot;).
* &quot;Phytolacca polyandra&quot; Batalin – Central and southwest China (syn. &quot;P. clavigera&quot; W.W.Smith).
* &quot;Phytolacca pruinosa&quot; Fenzl – Levantine Pokeweed. Southern Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon and Syria.
* &quot;Phytolacca rivinoides&quot; Kunth &amp; C.D.Bouché – Central and South America.
* &quot;Phytolacca sandwicensis&quot; Endl. – Hawaiian Pokeweed. Hawaii.
* &quot;Phytolacca thyrsiflora&quot; Fenzl ex J.A.Schmidt – Northern South America.
* &quot;Phytolacca weberbaueri&quot; H.Walt. – Yumbi. Peru.

===Formerly placed here===
*&quot;Leea asiatica&quot; (as &quot;P. asiatica&quot; )
*&quot;Terminalia catappa&quot; (as &quot;P. javanica&quot; )

==Ecology==

The ombú (Phytolacca dioica) grows as a tree on the pampas of South America and is one of the few providers of shade on the open grassland. It is a symbol of Uruguay, Argentina and gaucho culture. &quot;P. weberbaueri&quot; from Peru also grows to tree size. Both species have massively buttressed bases to their trunks, and very soft wood with a high water storage capacity which makes them resistant to grass fires and drought.

In the Pacific Northwest of North America, pokeweed is an invasive species.

== Uses ==

&quot;Phytolacca americana&quot; (American pokeweed, pokeweed, poke) is used as a folk medicine and as food, although all parts of it must be considered toxic unless, as folk recipes claim, it is &quot;properly prepared.&quot; The root is never eaten and cannot be made edible. Poke salad (&#x27;poke salat&#x27;) is considered part of traditional southern U.S. cuisine, where it is cooked three times in three changes of boiling water to remove some of the harmful components. Toxic constituents which have been identified include the alkaloids phytolaccine and phytolaccotoxin, as well as a glycoprotein.

==Fossil record==
A &quot;Phytolacca&quot;-like fossil has been described from the Upper Cretaceous (late Campanian) Cerro del Pueblo Formation, Coahuila, Mexico, it is a permineralized multiple infructescence composed of berries with six locules, each containing a single seed with a curved embryo developed in a curved ovule with pendulous placentation, a berry anatomy that is similar to that of the genus &quot;Phytolacca&quot;. Though this new plant from Coahuila shares reproductive characters with &quot;Phytolacca&quot;, the constant number (six) of carpels per fruit and pendulous placentation support the recognition of a new genus, &quot;Coahuilacarpon phytolaccoides&quot;.

<doc id="313253" wikidata="Q3686766" url="?curid=313253" title="McDonnell Douglas C-9">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas C-9 is a retired military version of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliner. It was produced as the C-9A Nightingale for the United States Air Force, and the C-9B Skytrain II for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. The final flight of the C-9A Nightingale was in September 2005, and the C-9C was retired in September 2011. The U.S. Navy retired its last C-9B in July 2014. The two remaining C-9s in Marine service were retired in April 2017.

Despite being officially retired, one C-9B, BuNo 161529, was seen as late as November 2020 being operated by the U.S. Air Force as an experimental sensor testbed.

==Design and development==
In 1966, the U.S. Air Force identified a need for an aeromedical transport aircraft and ordered C-9A Nightingale aircraft the following year. Deliveries began in 1968. The U.S. Air Force received 21 C-9A aircraft from 1968 to 1969. The C-9As were used for medical evacuation, passenger transportation, and special missions from 1968 to 2005. The C-9A were named for English social reformer Florence Nightingale (1820–1910), the founder of modern nursing.
After selecting a modified DC-9 for passenger and cargo transport, the U.S. Navy ordered its first five C-9Bs, bureau numbers 159030 thru 159034. However, since the Air Force was responsible for moving military personnel from place to place in the early 1970s under the Military Airlift Command, this order was canceled.

The Navy documented to Congress that their people were being given last seating on Air Force flights. Congress authorized the Navy to fly its own passenger/cargo jets shortly thereafter. The Navy ordered eight aircraft, bureau numbers 159113 thru 159120. The first four went to VR-30 at NAS Alameda in California for west coast logistical support while the second four went to VR-1 at Norfolk in Virginia for east coast support. An additional six aircraft, bureau numbers 160046 through 160051 were delivered to the Navy and the Marine Corps in 1976 with the first two aircraft being delivered to the Marine Corps at MCAS Cherry Point, the second two delivered to VR-1 at NAS Norfolk and the last two delivered to VR-30 at NAS Alameda. An additional ten more new and ten used DC-9s were purchased and converted to C-9B for the Navy. The last C-9B to fly for the Navy was retired on 28 June 2014.

Many of the Navy&#x27;s C-9Bs had a higher maximum gross take-off weight of . Auxiliary fuel tanks were installed in the lower cargo hold to augment the aircraft&#x27;s range to nearly for overseas missions, along with the addition of tail mounted infrared scramblers to counter heat seeking missile threats in hostile environments.

==Operational history==
The C-9B aircraft have provided cargo and passenger transportation as well as forward deployed air logistics support for the Navy and Marine Corps. (The original &quot;Skytrain&quot; was the World War II era C-47 developed from the civilian DC-3.) A C-9B was also chosen by NASA for reduced gravity research, replacing the aging KC-135 Vomit Comet.

The C-9B squadron (VR) were located throughout the continental U.S., with detachments operated in Europe, and Asia.

==Variants==
* C-9A Nightingale - 21 aeromedical evacuation aircraft based on the DC-9-32CF for U.S. Air Force delivered during 1968–69. One was converted for executive transport and stationed at Chievres, Belgium; a second aircraft was converted for VIP transport by the 86th Airlift Wing at Ramstein Air Base.
* C-9B Skytrain II - 24 convertible passenger/transport versions of the DC-9-32CF for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps delivered from 1973 to 1976. Five more C-9s were converted from passenger configured DC-9s.
* VC-9C - 3 executive transport aircraft for the U.S. Air Force; these were delivered in 1976 and served until 2011.
* C-9K - 2 aircraft for the Kuwait Air Force.

<text>The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was a treaty which was signed on September 27, 1830, and proclaimed on February 24, 1831, between the Choctaw American Indian tribe and the United States government. This treaty was the first removal treaty which was carried into effect under the Indian Removal Act. The treaty ceded about 11 million acres (45,000 km2) of the Choctaw Nation in what is now Mississippi in exchange for about 15 million acres (61,000 km2) in the Indian territory, now the state of Oklahoma. The principal Choctaw negotiators were Chief Greenwood LeFlore, Mosholatubbee, and Nittucachee; the U.S. negotiators were Colonel John Coffee and Secretary of War John Eaton.

The site of the signing of this treaty is in the southwest corner of Noxubee County; the site was known to the Choctaw as Bok Chukfi Ahilha (creek &quot;bok&quot; rabbit &quot;chukfi&quot; place to dance &quot;a+hilha&quot; or Dancing Rabbit Creek). The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was the last major land cession treaty which was signed by the Choctaw. With ratification by the U.S. Congress in 1831, the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in Mississippi to become the first major non-European ethnic group to gain recognition as U.S. citizens.

== Overview ==
On August 25, 1830, the Choctaw were supposed to meet with President Andrew Jackson in Franklin, Tennessee, but Greenwood Leflore informed the Secretary of War, John H. Eaton, that the chiefs were fiercely opposed to attending. The president was upset but, as the journalist Len Green wrote in 1978, &quot;Although angered by the Choctaw refusal to meet him in Tennessee, Jackson felt from LeFlore&#x27;s words that he might have a foot in the door and dispatched Secretary of War Eaton and John Coffee to meet with the Choctaws in their nation.&quot; Jackson appointed Eaton and General John Coffee as commissioners to represent him to meet the Choctaws where the &quot;rabbits gather to dance.&quot;

The commissioners met with the chiefs and headmen on September 15, 1830, at Dancing Rabbit Creek. In a carnival-like atmosphere, the US officials explained the policy of removal through interpreters to an audience of 6,000 men, women and children. The Choctaws faced migration west of the Mississippi River or submitting to U.S. and state law as citizens. The treaty would sign away the remaining traditional homeland to the United States; however, a provision in the treaty made removal more acceptable.

The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was one of the largest land transfers ever signed between the United States government and American Indians in time of peace. The Choctaw ceded their remaining traditional homeland to the United States. Article 14 allowed for some Choctaw to remain in the state of Mississippi, if they wanted to become citizens:

ART. XIV. Each Choctaw head of a family being desirous to remain and become a citizen of the States, shall be permitted to do so, by signifying his intention to the Agent within six months from the ratification of this Treaty, and he or she shall thereupon be entitled to a reservation of one section of six hundred and forty acres of land, to be bounded by sectional lines of survey; in like manner shall be entitled to one half that quantity for each unmarried child which is living with him over ten years of age; and a quarter section to such child as may be under 10 years of age, to adjoin the location of the parent. If they reside upon said lands intending to become citizens of the States for five years after the ratification of this Treaty, in that case a grant in fee simple shall issue; said reservation shall include the present improvement of the head of the family, or a portion of it. Persons who claim under this article shall not lose the privilege of a Choctaw citizen, but if they ever remove are not to be entitled to any portion of the Choctaw annuity.

The Choctaw were the first of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; to be removed from the southeastern United States, as the federal and state governments desired Indian lands to accommodate a growing agrarian American society. Nearly 15,000 Choctaws together with 1,000 slaves made the move to what would be called Indian Territory and then later Oklahoma. The population transfer occurred in three migrations during the 1831–33 period including the devastating winter blizzard of 1830–31 and the cholera epidemic of 1832. About 2,500 died along the trail of tears. Approximately 5,000–6,000 Choctaws remained in Mississippi in 1831 after the initial removal efforts. For the next ten years those that remained were objects of increasing legal conflict, harassment, and intimidation. The Choctaw that migrated, like the Creek, Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Seminole who followed them, attempted to resurrect their traditional lifestyle and government in their new homeland.

The Choctaw at this crucial time became two distinct groups: the Nation in Oklahoma and the Tribe in Mississippi. The nation retained its autonomy to regulate itself, but the tribe left in Mississippi had to submit to state and U.S. laws. Under article XIV, the Mississippi Choctaws became one of the first major non-European ethnic group to gain U.S. citizenship. The Choctaw sought to elect a representative to the U.S. House of Representatives.

===Unratified section===

The following paragraph of the treaty was not ratified:

&quot;WHEREAS the General Assembly of the State of Mississippi has extended the laws of said State to persons and property within the chartered limits of the same, and the President of the United States has said that he cannot protect the Choctaw people from the operation of these laws; Now therefore that the Choctaw may live under their own laws in peace with the United States and the State of Mississippi they have determined to sell their lands east of the Mississippi and have accordingly agreed to the following articles of treaty&quot;.

==Signatories==

The main signatories included John Eaton, John Coffee, Greenwood Leflore, Musholatubbee, and Nittucachee. Nearly 200 other signatures are on the treaty.

==Aftermath==


After ceding nearly , the Choctaw emigrated in three stages: the first in the fall of 1831, the second in 1832 and the last in 1833. The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was ratified by the U.S. Senate on February 25, 1831, and the President was anxious to make it a model of removal. The chief George W. Harkins wrote a letter to the American people before the removals began:

Around 15,000 Choctaws left the old Choctaw Nation for the Indian Territory, much of the state of Oklahoma today. The name &quot;Oklahoma&quot; was created in 1886 by Principal Chief Allen Wright (Choctaw, 1826–1885). The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma states that in the Choctaw language &quot;Okla&quot; means &quot;people&quot; and &quot;humma&quot; means &quot;red.&quot;
Late 20th-century estimates are that between 5,000 and 6,000 Choctaws remained in Mississippi in 1831 after the first removal. For the next ten years they were objects of increasing legal conflict, harassment, and intimidation. The Choctaw described their situation in 1849:

we have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died.

Joseph B. Cobb, a settler who moved to Mississippi from Georgia, described the Choctaw as having

no nobility or virtue at all, and in some respect he found blacks, especially native Africans, more interesting and admirable, the red man&#x27;s superior in every way. The Choctaw and Chickasaw, the tribes he knew best, were beneath contempt, that is, even worse than black slaves.

The removals continued well into the early 20th century. In 1903, three hundred Mississippi Choctaws were persuaded to move to the Nation in Oklahoma. The Choctaw did not gain a delegate on the floor of the U.S. House of Representative. Greenwood LeFlore, a Choctaw leader, stayed in Mississippi, where he was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives and Senate.

The Choctaw Nation continued to thrive until Oklahoma was created as a state. Their government was dismantled under the Curtis Act, along with those of other Native American nations in the former Indian Territory, to permit the admission of Oklahoma as a state. Their communal lands were divided and allotted to individual households under the Dawes Act to increase assimilation as American-style farmers. The US declared communal land remaining after allotment to be surplus and sold it to American settlers. In the 20th century, the Choctaw reorganized and were recognized by the government as the Choctaw Nation.

The descendants of the Choctaw who stayed in Mississippi reorganized themselves as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in 1945 and gained federal recognition.

<doc id="313258" wikidata="Q552893" url="?curid=313258" title="Beechcraft C-12 Huron">
<text>The Beechcraft C-12 Huron is the military designation for a series of twin-engine turboprop aircraft based on the Beechcraft Super King Air and Beechcraft 1900. C-12 variants are used by the United States Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps. These aircraft are used for various duties, including embassy support, medical evacuation, as well as passenger and light cargo transport. Some aircraft are modified with surveillance systems for various missions, including the Cefly Lancer, Beechcraft RC-12 Guardrail and Project Liberty programs.

==Design and development==
Originally designated U-25A, the first C-12A models entered service with the U.S. Army in 1974 and were used as a liaison and general personnel transport. The aircraft was essentially an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; Super King Air 200, powered by the type&#x27;s standard Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-41 engines.

The U.S. Navy followed suit in 1979, ordering a version of the Super King Air A200C (modified with a 1.32 m by 1.32 m; 52 inch by 52 inch cargo door from the Super King Air 200C), designating it the UC-12B, for logistics support between Naval and Marine Corps air stations, air facilities, and other activities, both in CONUS and overseas. The cabin can readily accommodate cargo, passengers or both. It is also equipped to accept litter patients in medical evacuation missions. Through 1982, the Navy ordered 64 of these aircraft.

A U.S. Air Force variant of the plane for surveillance roles primarily over Afghanistan and Iraq was the MC-12W Liberty. For that variant, Beechcraft built the basic plane and then sent it to Greenville, Texas where sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) equipment was installed by L-3 Communications Missions Integration. As of 2013 the Liberty program had exceeded 300,000 combat flying hours. The MC-12W was rushed into combat as a supplemental surveillance and signals intelligence asset. Since its first combat mission on 10 June 2009, the aircraft flew 400,000 combat hours in 79,000 combat sorties, aiding in the kill or capture of &quot;more than 8,000 terrorists&quot; and uncovering 650 weapons caches. With its roles taken over by the growing MQ-9 Reaper fleet, the Air Force decided to divest itself of the 41 Liberty aircraft and turn them over to the U.S. Army and U.S. Special Operations Command, which was completed by October 2015. The Air Force&#x27;s final MC-12W deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom ended on 13 October 2015.

===TC-12B===
The TC-12B Huron was a twin-engine, pressurized version of the Beechcraft Super King Air 200. Twenty-five served with the U.S. Navy with Training Squadron 35 (VT-35), the Navy&#x27;s only TC-12B Huron squadron based at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas, home of the Training Air Wing 4 (TAW-4). The Navy retired this aircraft on 16 May 2017 and replaced and now relies on the T-44C for multi engine training.

===UC-12F/M===
The UC-12F and UC-12M are light passenger and cargo airlift versions procured for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps from 1986 and 1987 respectively. They are based on the Super King Air 200, use PT6A-42 engines, and have a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of . They are configured as combi aircraft and are also used for multi-engine training and testing.

===C-12J===
To meet the needs of transporting larger groups, the U.S. Army purchased six C-12J aircraft, based on the Beechcraft 1900C commuter airliner. One of the military C-12Js is used for GPS jamming tests at the 586th Flight Test Squadron, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Another is based at the 517th Airlift Squadron, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. Three were based at the 55th Airlift Flight, Osan Air Base, South Korea. They have been relocated to the 459th Airlift Squadron, Yokota Air Base, Japan. The remaining two are used by U.S. Army Aviation.

Although the UD- series 1900s were manufactured exclusively for military use, the United States military and other military and government organizations use 1900s from other series such as the UB-series 1900C, and 1900Ds which may be found elsewhere.

===UC-12W===
The UC-12W is an improved version of the UC-12F/M for the Marine Corps procured from 2010 for the same missions. It is based on the Super King Air 350, uses PT6A-60A engines, and has an MTOW of . According to its 2022 Marine Aviation Plan, United States Marine Corps Aviation plans to phase out the Model 200-based UC-12F and UC-12M along with the Cessna UC-35D and replace them with new UC-12Ws by 2032.

<doc id="313260" wikidata="Q878759" url="?curid=313260" title="John Eaton (politician)">
<text>John Henry Eaton (June 18, 1790November 17, 1856) was an American politician and ambassador from Tennessee who served as U.S. Senator and as U.S. Secretary of War in the administration of Andrew Jackson. He was 28 years, 4 months, and 29 days old when he entered the Senate, making him the youngest U.S. Senator in history.

Eaton was a lawyer in Tennessee who became part of a network that supported the political campaigns of Andrew Jackson. He also served in the militia as a major, and during the War of 1812 became an aide to Jackson; Eaton served with Jackson in all his wartime campaigns and battles, including the Battle of New Orleans. After serving in the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1815 and 1816, in 1818 Eaton was elected to the U.S. Senate, though he had not yet reached the constitutionally mandated age of 30.

Following Jackson&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1828, Eaton resigned his Senate seat to join Jackson&#x27;s cabinet as Secretary of War. Eaton and his wife Peggy became the focus of controversy during Jackson&#x27;s first term; in the so-called Petticoat affair, Washington&#x27;s society wives refused to socialize with the Eatons. The wives of the vice president, cabinet members, and members of Congress looked down on Peggy because of the circumstances of her marriage to Eaton; they had wed shortly after the death of her first husband, without waiting for the usual mourning period, giving rise to rumors that she had been unfaithful to her first husband before his death. Eaton resigned as Secretary of War as part of a strategy to resolve the controversy; he later received appointments as Governor of Florida Territory and U.S. Minister to Spain.

Upon returning to the United States in 1840, Eaton refused to endorse incumbent Martin Van Buren for reelection to the presidency, angering Jackson. In retirement, Eaton resided in Washington. He died there in 1856, and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery.

==Early life==
John Eaton was born on June 18, 1790, near Scotland Neck, Halifax County, North Carolina to John and Elizabeth Eaton. The elder John Eaton was a furniture maker who served as county coroner and member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. Eaton&#x27;s uncle, Major Pinketham Eaton (sometimes spelled Pinkerton), was a Continental Army officer who died in combat during the Revolutionary War. The first Eaton forebear in America was Andrew Eaton, a watchmaker from Godalming, Surrey born in 1678 who emigrated to North Carolina in 1699. Eaton&#x27;s father owned a large amount of land in middle Tennessee, and the 1790 census lists him as the owner of 12 slaves. The younger Eaton attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1802 to 1804. He then studied law, attained admission to the bar, and moved to Franklin, Tennessee, where he established a law practice.

Eaton became active in the Tennessee militia, and attained the rank of major. He developed a close friendship with Andrew Jackson, and served as an aide to Jackson during the Creek War and the War of 1812. Eaton took part in all Jackson&#x27;s major campaigns. He supported Jackson&#x27;s controversial decision in November 1814 to attack Pensacola in Spanish Florida, claiming that Spain had put herself in a belligerent position by allowing its territory to be occupied by British soldiers. Eaton participated in the Battle of New Orleans. After the war, Jackson took command of the Southern U.S. Army District with his headquarters at his home, The Hermitage. Eaton served on his staff. Eaton later became a major proponent of Jackson&#x27;s presidential candidacy. He also wrote the epitaph on Rachel Jackson&#x27;s grave.

John Reid, another Jackson aide, began a biography of Jackson in 1816, but died after writing only four chapters. Eaton finished the book, which was published as &quot;The Life of Andrew Jackson&quot; in 1817. This book was revised and republished in 1824 and 1828. It became a major primary reference for future Jackson biographers.

==Senate career==
From 1815 to 1816, Eaton was a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1818, he was elected to serve as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, and he served until 1829. His age of 28 at the time of his entry to the Senate was notable; it violated the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s requirement that all senators be at least 30 years old. Eaton&#x27;s age of 28 makes him the youngest person ever known to have served in the Senate.
Eaton was a slaveowner, but, unlike many Southerners, he supported the Missouri Compromise of 1820. On March 11, 1820, in a letter to Jackson, he claimed that &quot;it has preserved piece and dissipated angry feelings, and dispelled appearances which seemed dark and horrible and threatening to the interest and harmony of the nation.&quot; He remained a close friend of Jackson, and while in the Senate supported the Jacksonian movement. He urged Jackson to accept an appointment as Governor of the newly acquired Florida Territory in 1821, which he did. From 1827 to 1829, Eaton served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia.

In 1822, Eaton and his brother-in-law William Berkeley Lewis attempted to nominate a candidate before the Tennessee legislature to oppose incumbent U.S. Senator John Williams, who was openly against Jackson&#x27;s candidacy for president in 1824 presidential election. After being unable to find a viable candidate, they nominated Jackson himself. The strategy was successful, and Jackson won. Eaton also helped advance Jackson&#x27;s campaign for president through the &quot;Letters of Wyoming,&quot; which were printed in newspapers. In them, Eaton praised Jackson&#x27;s record. He celebrated even some of Jackson&#x27;s most controversial actions, such as the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in New Orleans in 1815. &quot;Washington would have done the same,&quot; he asserted.

In 1825, Eaton received an honorary degree (Master of Arts) from the University of North Carolina. Eaton supported the Tariff of 1828, or the &quot;Tariff of Abominations.&quot;

==Marriages==
In 1813, Eaton married his first wife, Myra Lewis (1788–1815), the daughter of William Terrell Lewis, a prominent Tennessee businessman and landowner. After the death of their father, Jackson became legal guardian to Myra and her sister Mary, and Eaton&#x27;s marriage to Myra Lewis strengthened his relationship with Jackson.

Eaton married his second wife Peggy O&#x27;Neill Timberlake (1799–1879) in 1829, while serving in the Senate. She was the mother of three children; a son William, who died as an infant, and daughters Virginia and Margaret. Eaton had been a longtime friend of Peggy Timberlake and her husband John B. Timberlake, and John Timberlake had died only a few months before Eaton married his widow. Jackson knew and liked Peggy Eaton and encouraged Eaton to marry her, telling him &quot;Why yes, Major. If you love the woman, and she will have you, marry her by all means.&quot; He asked Eaton to marry her as soon as possible. Eaton had no children with either wife.

==Secretary of War==
===Petticoat affair===
Jackson, leading the new Democratic Party, won the 1828 presidential election, and in March 1829 Eaton resigned his Senate seat to accept appointment as Jackson&#x27;s Secretary of War. The appointment was seemingly made because of Jackson&#x27;s desire to have a personal friend in the Cabinet in whom he could confide.

Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, the wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun, snubbed the Eatons because they married so soon after John Timberlake&#x27;s death, rather than waiting for the usual mourning period; there were stories that Eaton and Peggy Timberlake had been having an affair before John Timberlake had died. Rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father&#x27;s tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. They refused to attend social events at which she would be present. According to Emily Donelson, Eaton considered resigning in the first months of the administration.

Jackson refused to believe the rumors about Mrs. Eaton&#x27;s past conduct, telling his Cabinet that &quot;She is as chaste as a virgin!&quot; In his view, the dishonorable people were the rumormongers, in part because he was reminded of the attacks that had been made, particularly in the 1828 election, against his wife over the circumstances of their marriage. Jackson also believed that John Calhoun fanned the flames of the controversy as a way to gain political leverage for a growing anti-Jackson coalition. Duff Green, a Calhoun protégé and editor of the &quot;United States Telegraph,&quot; accused Eaton of secretly working to have pro-Calhoun cabinet members Samuel D. Ingham (Treasury) and John Branch (Navy) removed from their positions.

Jackson biographers Richard B. Latner and Robert V. Remini believe that the hostility towards the Eatons was rooted less in questions of morality and proper behavior than in politics. Eaton had been in favor of the Tariff of Abominations, which Calhoun bitterly opposed and which led him to elucidate the doctrine of nullification. He was also close to Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, another supporter of the tariff and Calhoun&#x27;s main rival for who would succeed Jackson as president. Calhoun may have wanted to expel Eaton from the cabinet as a way of boosting his anti-tariff agenda and increasing his standing in the Democratic Party. Many other cabinet members were Southerners and may have felt similarly, especially Ingham, a close Calhoun ally who supported his presidential aspirations.

Eaton took his revenge on Calhoun. In the spring of 1830, reports emerged accurately stating that Calhoun, while Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson. The biggest bombshell was a letter given to Jackson on May 12 by William H. Crawford, Monroe&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury, in which Crawford stated that, contrary to Jackson&#x27;s former suspicions, it was Calhoun, not himself, who vocally advocated censuring Jackson in Monroe&#x27;s cabinet. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson about the possibility of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson at the time of the Seminole War. Eaton did nothing. This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the &quot;Telegraph.&quot; This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him, and further enraged the President.

Meanwhile, Van Buren, a widower, took Jackson&#x27;s side and defended the Eatons. This raised Van Buren in Jackson&#x27;s esteem, and, in addition to disagreements between Jackson and Calhoun on a number of other issues, mainly the Nullification Crisis, marked him as Calhoun&#x27;s likely vice presidential successor. In the spring of 1831, Van Buren helped end the Petticoat affair by offering to resign as Secretary of State. This gave Jackson the opportunity to reorganize his cabinet by asking for other resignations, and he was able to replace the anti-Eaton secretaries; only Postmaster General William T. Barry remained. Eaton, being the source of the controversy, also agreed to resign his position.

On June 17, the day before Eaton formally resigned, a text appeared in the &quot;Telegraph&quot; stating that it had been &quot;proved&quot; that the families of Ingham, Branch, and Attorney General John M. Berrien had refused to associate with Mr. Eaton. Eaton wrote to all three men demanding that they answer for the article. Ingham sent back a contemptuous letter stating that, while he was not the source for the article, the information was still true. On June 18, Eaton challenged Ingham to a duel through his second, his brother-in-law Dr. Philip G. Randolph, who visited Ingham twice and threatened him the second time with personal harm if he did not comply with Eaton&#x27;s demands. Randolph was dismissed, and the next morning Ingham sent a note to Eaton discourteously declining the invitation. It described Eaton&#x27;s situation as one of &quot;pity and contempt.&quot; Eaton wrote a letter back to Ingham accusing him of cowardice. Ingham was then informed that Eaton, Randolph, and others were looking to assault him. He gathered together his own bodyguard, and was not immediately molested. However, he reported that for the next two nights Eaton and his men continued to lurk about his dwelling and threaten him. He then left the city, and returned safely to his home. Ingham communicated to Jackson his version of what took place, and Jackson then asked Eaton to answer for the charge. Eaton admitted that he &quot;passed by&quot; the place where Ingham had been staying, &quot;but at no point attempted to enter...or besiege it.&quot;

In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to England. Calhoun killed the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming his act would &quot;...kill him, sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick.&quot; However, Calhoun only made Van Buren seem the victim of petty politics, which were rooted largely in the Eaton controversy. Van Buren was nominated for vice president, and was elected as Jackson&#x27;s running mate when Jackson won a second term in 1832. The affair had a hand in the replacement of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; as the main propaganda instrument for the administration. Jackson enlisted the help of longtime supporter Francis Preston Blair, who in November 1830 established a newspaper known as &quot;The Washington Globe,&quot; which from then on served as the mouthpiece of the Democratic Party. It also contributed to the creation of the Kitchen Cabinet.

===Indian affairs===
In the summer of 1830, following the passage of the Indian Removal Act, allowing for the transportation of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; from their homes in the South to lands being given to them in Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma), Jackson, Eaton, and General John Coffee negotiated with the Chickasaw, who quickly agreed to move west by agreeing to the Treaty of Franklin in August. Jackson put Eaton and Coffee in charge of negotiating with the Choctaw. They frequently bribed the chiefs in order to gain their submission. Their tactics typically worked, and the chiefs signed the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, agreeing to move west. The removal of the Choctaw took place in the winter of 1831 and 1832, and was wrought with misery and suffering.

===Other activities===
As Secretary of War, Eaton supported compensation upon discharge for soldiers who had served honorably. He made the Topographical Engineers a separate bureau within the War Department.

==Later career==

Following his resignation as Secretary of War, Eaton returned to Tennessee. His wife suffered a period of ill health after arriving. Jackson planned to replace him in the War Department with Tennessee senator Hugh Lawson White. This would vacate White&#x27;s senate seat, which Eaton would presumably fill. However, White refused the cabinet position despite much prodding from Jackson. Eaton attempted to return to the Senate by running against incumbent Felix Grundy in 1832. Jackson officially remained neutral during the election, as Grundy was also a Democrat, and Eaton was defeated. He served as a delegate to the 1832 Democratic National Convention. In a letter to Jackson before the convention, Eaton declared his strong support for Jackson&#x27;s choice of Van Buren for vice president. He also requested that several of his friends be given appointments in the administration.

Eaton later received appointments that took him away from Washington, D.C. He served first as Governor of the Florida Territory from 1834 to 1836. In 1835, violence began to escalate between the Seminole Indians and white settlers. Members of the Seminole had signed Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing in which they agreed to move westward. However, many began to resist. Eaton warned Jackson against an excessive show of military force, fearing that this would only provoke the Seminole further. Jackson heeded his advice at first, but continuing to do so proved impossible, as Seminole attacks continued. The violence eventually led to the Second Seminole War.

In 1836, Eaton was replaced as governor by Richard K. Call. Later that year, he was appointed Ambassador to Spain, and he served until April 1840. His tenure was undistinguished; a predecessor in the post, Cornelius P. Van Ness, strongly castigated Eaton, reporting that the Spanish government thought little of Eaton&#x27;s abilities. He believed Eaton to be &quot;not only incapable of putting together two common ideas but of comprehending a single one,&quot; and contended that Eaton&#x27;s work habits could best be described as &quot;indolent.&quot; He also indicated that Mrs. Eaton engaged in spreading gossip about Van Buren, and that her manner was forward enough that the Spanish government considered her to be the &quot;real&quot; minister. Finally, Van Ness accused the Eatons of drinking excessively, writing that &quot;he and she regularly dispose of two bottles of rum of the strongest kind in the spirit of three days; this is, four glasses each and every day, besides wine: and while they are taking it and he chewing, she smokes her cigars.&quot;

==Retirement and death==
Upon returning from Spain, Eaton announced that he was unwilling to support Van Buren&#x27;s campaign for reelection to the presidency in 1840. He endorsed Van Buren&#x27;s opponent, William Henry Harrison. Supposedly, this action was rooted in Eaton&#x27;s displeasure over the way he was allegedly treated by Van Buren while serving as Ambassador to Spain. &quot;My friend Maj. Eaton comes home not in good humor. He says he has been dismissed,&quot; Jackson wrote. The declaration deeply upset Jackson, who in a letter to Blair went so far as to accuse Eaton of having &quot;apostatised and taken the field with the piebald opposition of abolitionists, antimasons and blue light federalists.&quot; Eaton officially joined the Whig Party, but for the remainder of his life was not politically active. He and Jackson encountered each other in 1840 while Jackson was travelling throughout Tennessee to campaign for Van Buren. According to Remini, &quot;both men behaved properly.&quot; Jackson biographer James Parton wrote in 1860 that Eaton and Jackson remained unreconciled. However, 21st century historian John F. Marszalek claims that the two men did reconcile with each other just before Jackson&#x27;s death in 1845.

Eaton and his wife lived comfortably in retirement in Washington, D.C. He resumed his law practice, and he and his wife returned to Franklin during the summers. Eaton chose not to join any church, but figured prominently in Washington social circles. He was president of the Washington Bar Association. Eaton and his wife were once again reported to have drunk to excess, and he was criticized for taking up a legal case against Amos Kendall, a staunch Jacksonian who had defended the Eatons&#x27; conduct during the Petticoat affair. Eaton died in Washington on November 17, 1856, at age 66. His funeral was conducted at his residence. Eaton was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington.

==Legacy==
Contemporary William Joseph Snelling, in his 1831 biography of Jackson, strongly criticizes Eaton. Of Eaton&#x27;s Jackson biography, he writes, &quot;it is hard to say which is more disgraced, the hero [Jackson] or the historian. The book contains scarcely a period of good English, but makes amends by abundance of fulsome adulation, by the omission of many disgraceful acts and the palliation of others.&quot; By 1831, Snelling says, he had become &quot;the laughing-stock of the nation.&quot; Washington chronicler Benjamin Perley Poore called Eaton&#x27;s biography &quot;the recognized textbook for Democratic editors and stump speakers, and although entirely unreliable, it has formed the basis for the lives of General Jackson since published.&quot; Remini says that &quot;the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And it was all so needless.&quot;

In spite of this, an obituary published in Washington&#x27;s &quot;Daily National Intelligencer&quot; spoke favorably of Eaton. It noted that after his death Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, a Jackson appointee, had adjourned a session of the Supreme Court early in order that those present could attend the funeral.

Eaton&#x27;s biography of Jackson has remained an important source for historians, particularly with regard to Jackson&#x27;s military career. An edition of the work, edited by Frank Lawrence Owsley, was published in 1974. Owlsey&#x27;s edition includes the original work with later changes noted in the appendages. He says in the introduction that the original work, published in 1817, is &quot;by far the superior historical account,&quot; on account of the later editions being published for partisan purposes as campaign literature. According to Owsley, the leading historian among the Southern Agrarians, and a Confederate apologist with white supremacist leanings, the later editions excised anything that could be seen as critical of Jackson, anything that gave credit to others over or with him, and any criticism of people that was seen as politically damaging, while adding praise for Jackson. Owsley attributes many of the unfavorable reviews of Eaton&#x27;s work to people using the later editions and not realizing the extent to which they were revised from the original. 

Eaton County, Michigan, is named in Eaton&#x27;s honor.

<text>The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette is the newspaper of record in the U.S. state of Arkansas, printed in Little Rock with a northwest edition published in Lowell. It is distributed for sale in all 75 of Arkansas&#x27;s counties.

By virtue of one of its predecessors, the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; (founded in 1819), it claims to be the oldest continuously published newspaper west of the Mississippi River. The original print shop of the &quot;Gazette&quot; is preserved at the Historic Arkansas Museum in Little Rock.

==History==

===Early years===
The history of the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; goes back to the earliest days of territorial Arkansas. William E. Woodruff arrived at the territorial capital at Arkansas Post in late 1819 on a dugout canoe with a second-hand wooden press. He cranked out the first edition of the Arkansas Gazette on November 20, 1819, 17 years before Arkansas became a state. The &quot;Gazette&quot; scrupulously avoided political involvement or endorsement early in its history.

In 1821, the territorial capital was moved to Little Rock, and Woodruff moved his &quot;Gazette&quot; along with it. The &quot;Gazette&quot; led the campaign for Arkansas statehood, accomplished in 1836, and constantly promoted new immigration.

The &quot;Gazette&quot; supported Texas independence and called for volunteers from Arkansas to assist the Texans and supported the Mexican–American War. In the 1840s, Woodruff lost control of the paper and established a competing paper, the &quot;Arkansas Democrat&quot; (unrelated to the later &quot;Democrat&quot;).

In 1855, editor Christopher C. Danley and Solon Borland took ownership of the newspaper, turning it into a mouthpiece for the Know Nothing party.

===American Civil War era===
The &quot;Gazette&quot; struggled through the early American Civil War, facing financial problems and shortages of supplies. The &quot;Gazette&quot; had initially been pro-United States but altered its position after U.S. President Abraham Lincoln called for a 75,000-man militia, much like Arkansas.

In 1863, U.S. troops recaptured Little Rock, and the &quot;Gazette&quot; suspended publication until May 1865, while U.S. authorities used the presses for publications.

===Competition after the Civil War===

During Reconstruction, a competitor arose by various names, under various editors, and with several different owners. In 1878, J.N. Smithee bought the newspaper, changed its name to the Arkansas Democrat, and went after lucrative state printing contracts held by the &quot;Gazette&quot;.

The &quot;Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Democrat&quot; exchanged words that soon escalated into an exchange of gunfire between the owner of the &quot;Democrat&quot; and a part-owner of the &quot;Gazette&quot;.

Over the years, the &quot;Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Democrat&quot; supported opposing candidates and took opposite editorial positions. The &quot;Gazette&quot; remained the dominant state newspaper throughout the simmering battle. The &quot;Gazette&quot; was owned and edited by John Netherland Heiskell, who guided it with a firm hand through most of the 20th century.

In 1926, August Engel acquired a significant interest in the &quot;Democrat.&quot; He became the newspaper&#x27;s president and general manager, leading it through substantial growth over the next 43 years. Engel gained a reputation as a hard-working, shrewd businessman who actively participated in the editorial process.

===Central High crisis===
The &quot;Gazette&quot; took a strong editorial stance against Governor Orval Faubus when he tried to prevent the Little Rock Nine from integrating Little Rock Central High School in 1957. In 1958 the &quot;Gazette&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its stand; executive editor Harry Ashmore won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. This was the first time in history that a newspaper won two Pulitzer Prizes within the same year. Despite its honors, the circulation of the &quot;Gazette&quot; dropped during the crisis due to boycotts, which ended when Ashmore left the paper.

The &quot;Democrat&quot; charted a generally neutral editorial stand. Its photographer Will Counts took several important pictures of the crisis, including a famous photo of Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Nine, being shouted at by an angry white girl, later identified as Hazel Massery; the Associated Press declared it to be one of the top 100 photos of the 20th century. Counts also helped arrange the public reconciliation of Eckford and Massery in 1997.

Counts&#x27; work submitted by the &quot;Arkansas Democrat&quot; for the 1958 Pulitzer Prize received the unanimous recommendation of the Pulitzer jurors for Best Spot News Photography. However, Counts was denied the award when the Pulitzer board overruled its jurors and gave the award to another entrant which portrayed a different local police force as friendly to its citizens.

In 2005, the &quot;Democrat-Gazette&quot; editorial cartoonist John Deering and his wife Cathy created a bronze sculpture of the Nine, entitled &quot;Testament&quot;, on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol.

===The newspaper war===
Heiskell died in 1972, and his family continued to run the &quot;Gazette.&quot;
In 1974, the &quot;Democrat&quot; was sold to WEHCO Media Inc., owned by the Hussman family. Walter E. Hussman Jr., 27, became the publisher. At the time of Hussman&#x27;s arrival, the morning &quot;Gazette&quot; was far in front of the afternoon &quot;Democrat&quot;, with daily circulation 118,702 to the &quot;Democrat&#x27;s&quot; 62,405. Hussman embarked on a campaign of significant cost reductions and concentrated subscription efforts on the Little Rock urban market. These efforts had little success. By 1977, Hussman attempted to reach an agreement with the &quot;Gazette&quot; to combine operations, but his overtures were rejected.

Hussman vigorously fought back and intended to make the &quot;Democrat&quot; the state&#x27;s largest newspaper. A war ensued between the two papers. The &quot;Democrat&quot; expanded its news operation, offered free classified advertisements, and switched from afternoon to morning publication.

In 1979, Hussman appointed John Robert Starr to managing editor. The fiery and irascible Starr temperament and intent in the upcoming circulation war was humorously illustrated by a cover story in the monthly magazine &quot;Arkansas Times&quot; showing Starr squatting atop a &quot;Gazette&quot; newspaper box with a dagger between his teeth to show his seriousness. Starr doubled the size of the news staff and concentrated on hard news. Under Starr&#x27;s direction, readership increased steadily. During 1980, the &quot;Democrat&quot; was the fastest-growing newspaper in the United States.

The &quot;Gazette&quot; responded by hiring new staff, going to a color format, and filing a federal antitrust suit against the &quot;Democrat&quot; in 1984. The lawsuit accused the Hussman enterprises of predatory practices and trying to harm the &quot;Gazette.&quot; The &quot;Democrat&quot; responded that it was only trying to gain market share to be more competitive with the larger and more dominant &quot;Arkansas Gazette.&quot;

A federal jury in the court of U.S. District Judge William R. Overton rendered its verdict on March 26, 1986. The &quot;Democrat&quot; was found not guilty of all the allegations leveled against it by the &quot;Gazette&quot;.

The Heiskell family sold the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; to Gannett, the nation&#x27;s largest newspaper chain, on December 1, 1986.

Gannett had immense assets to fight the &quot;Democrat.&quot; However, it received criticism for bringing in out-of-town reporters and staff and losing the paper&#x27;s local feel. The &quot;Gazette&quot;, nicknamed the &quot;Old Lady&quot;, became flashier, but critics complained that the paper had lost the respect of the readership.

Over the next five years, the two newspapers dueled. The circulation of the &quot;Gazette&quot; remained steady over that period. Still, the daily circulation of the &quot;Democrat&quot; went from 81,000 to 131,000, and the Sunday circulation leaped ahead of the &quot;Gazette&quot;&#x27;s 218,000 to achieve 230,000.

===Victory of the &quot;Democrat&quot;===
The financial losses of the fiercely contested battle were too much for Gannett to justify. On October 18, 1991, Gannett threw in the towel and sold the &quot;Gazette&quot; to WEHCO. The first edition of the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; rolled off the presses the following day, October 19. Regardless of which paper they subscribed to, most Arkansans were saddened by the sudden loss of their historic newspaper.

Many of the reporters and staff of the more liberal &quot;Gazette&quot; were thrown out of work and not picked up by the more conservative &quot;Democrat-Gazette&quot;. Many former employees were bitter at Gannett for managing the newspaper war and angry at the &quot;Democrat&quot; for achieving victory. Many of the &quot;Old Lady&#x27;s&quot; employees left for other markets while some who remained aided in converting the &quot;Arkansas Times&quot; from a magazine format to a tabloid newspaper to provide a more liberal weekly alternative to the dominant conservative paper.

In the years since, the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; has maintained a higher circulation than newspapers in similarly sized cities. Many newspapers that defeated in-town rivals concentrated on reducing costs and reduced news coverage to meet their goals. The &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; has continued to balance quality goals with profitability. Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Greenberg was appointed the &quot;Democrat-Gazette&quot; editorial page editor on April 29, 1992. A sixth-generation Arkansan, Griffin Smith was appointed Executive Editor on June 23, 1992. Smith retired on May 1, 2012. Managing editor David Bailey, who joined the paper in May 1993, took over leadership of the newsroom operation. Greenberg stepped down on August 1, 2015, and David Barham, who joined the paper in 2002, took over as editorial page editor.

===Online===
Before most other newspapers, the &quot;Democrat-Gazette&quot; implemented a website paywall in 2002. The newspaper credits the strategy with helping it stem declines in circulation, where it has fared much better than the industry at large since that time. Most other newspapers that implemented paywalls later had been operating popular free-access websites for years, leading to reader backlash. &quot;The Economist&quot; noted that the strategy is aided by its &quot;virtual monopoly&quot; over news in the region.

===Digital conversion===
The &quot;Democrat-Gazett&quot;e ended print delivery of its Monday-Saturday papers statewide throughout 2018 and 2019 and transitioned to a digital replica edition. All subscribers were provided a new iPad to access the replica edition and one-on-one instruction, training, and technical assistance. The Sunday paper remains in traditional print circulation.

<text>James Biddle (February 18, 1783 – October 1, 1848), of the Biddle family, brother of financier Nicholas Biddle and nephew of Capt. Nicholas Biddle, was an American commodore. His flagship was .

==Education and early career==
Biddle was born in Philadelphia, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating, he entered service in the United States Navy as a midshipman in 1800.

Retained in the navy reduction of 1801, Biddle served in the war against the Barbary pirates. The ship he was in, , struck rocks off Tripoli, and along with his commodore, William Bainbridge, he was kept imprisoned for 19 months.

During the War of 1812, Biddle was first lieutenant in . He was in command of the sloop in 1815 when she defeated . In 1817, he was sent to the Columbia River in to formally take over the Oregon Country for the United States, which was completed in 1818.

After the war, Biddle performed various duties in the Gulf of Mexico, the South Atlantic, and the Mediterranean. In 1830, Biddle and US consul David Offly negotiated and concluded a treaty with the Sublime Porte. The treaty was later used by U.S. diplomats to claim extraterritorial privileges for U.S. citizens in the Ottoman Empire.

==Biddle and the USS &quot;Macedonian&quot;==
In the early nineteenth century, the prevalence of yellow fever in the Caribbean &quot;led to serious health problems&quot; and alarmed the United States Navy as numerous deaths and sickness curtailed naval operations and destroyed morale. A tragic example occurred in May 1822 when the frigate USS &quot;Macedonian&quot; left Boston and became part of Commodore James Biddle&#x27;s West Indies Squadron. Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson had assigned the squadron to guard United States merchant shipping and suppress piracy. During their deployment seventy six of the Macedonian officers and men died. Seventy four of these deaths were attributed to yellow fever. Biddle reported another fifty two of his crew were on sick-list. In his report to the Secretary of the Navy, Biddle and Surgeon&#x27;s Mate Dr. Charles Chase state the cause as &quot;fever&quot;. As a consequence of this loss Biddle noted his squadron was forced to return to Norfolk Navy Yard early. The &quot;Macedonian&quot; crew upon arrival were provided medical care and quarantined at Craney Island. Biddle upset at the loss of his crew wrote Smith Thompson &quot; how deeply my feelings have been afflicted at the disturbing mortality &amp; sickness and …. I hope you will order an investigation into the cause of the sickness on board.&quot; 

Biddle told Thompson the &quot;Macedonian&quot; had been improperly fitted out in Boston and while there, the frigate&#x27;s hold was never properly cleaned and that the filth and debris he discovered in the hold had led to the fever. Biddle consequently brought charges against Commodore Isaac Hull then in command at the Boston Naval Yard. Medical testimony during a court of inquiry however supported the conclusion that a drastic change in temperatures, dampness and tropical climate were the proximate cause of the fever, and &quot;Much to Biddle&#x27;s chagrin the court of inquiry found Hull not guilty.&quot; 

==Expeditions to Asia==

In December 1845, Biddle exchanged ratifications of the Treaty of Wanghia 
On July 20, 1846, he anchored with the two warships and in Uraga Channel at the mouth to Edo Bay in an attempt to open up Japan to trade with the United States, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Biddle delivered his request that Japan agree to a similar treaty to that which had just been negotiated with China. A few days later a Japanese junk approached Biddle&#x27;s flagship, and requested his presence on board their ship to receive the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s official response. Biddle was reluctant at first, but eventually agreed. As Biddle attempted to board the Japanese ship, he misunderstood the instructions of one of the samurai guards and was physically knocked back by the guard who then drew his sword. Biddle retreated to his flagship. The Japanese officials apologized for the mishap. Biddle eventually received the shogunate&#x27;s response, and was told that Japan forbade all commerce and communication with foreign nations besides that of the Dutch; also, he was informed that all foreign affairs were conducted through Nagasaki, and that his ships should leave Uraga immediately. 

Seven years later, Commodore Matthew Perry did the task with four warships. Perry was well aware of Biddle&#x27;s reception, and strove to make sure that he would not be treated in the same manner.

Biddle died in Philadelphia, and is buried at Christ Church Burial Ground in the family plot.

<text>Neutron diffraction or elastic neutron scattering is the application of neutron scattering to the determination of the atomic and/or magnetic structure of a material. A sample to be examined is placed in a beam of thermal or cold neutrons to obtain a diffraction pattern that provides information of the structure of the material. The technique is similar to X-ray diffraction but due to their different scattering properties, neutrons and X-rays provide complementary information: X-Rays are suited for superficial analysis, strong x-rays from synchrotron radiation are suited for shallow depths or thin specimens, while neutrons having high penetration depth are suited for bulk samples.

== History ==
=== Discovery of the neutron ===
In 1921, American chemist and physicist William D. Harkins introduced the term &quot;neutron&quot; while studying atomic structure and nuclear reactions. He proposed the existence of a neutral particle within the atomic nucleus, though there was no experimental evidence for it at the time. In 1932, British physicist James Chadwick provided experimental proof of the neutron’s existence. His discovery confirmed the presence of this neutral subatomic particle, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935. Chadwick’s research was influenced by earlier work from Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie, who had detected unexplained neutral radiation but had not recognized it as a distinct particle. Neutrons are subatomic particles that exist in the nucleus of the atom, it has higher mass than protons but no electrical charge.

In the 1930s Enrico Fermi and colleagues gave theoretical contributions establishing the foundation of neutron scattering. Fermi developed a framework to understand how neutrons interact with atomic nuclei.

===Early diffraction work===
Diffraction was first observed in 1936 by two groups, von Halban and Preiswerk and by Mitchell and Powers. In 1944, Ernest O. Wollan, with a background in X-ray scattering from his PhD work under Arthur Compton, recognized the potential for applying thermal neutrons from the newly operational X-10 nuclear reactor to crystallography. Joined by Clifford G. Shull they developed neutron diffraction throughout the 1940s. 

Neutron diffraction experiments were carried out in 1945 by Ernest O. Wollan using the Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge. He was joined shortly thereafter (June 1946) by Clifford Shull, and together they established the basic principles of the technique, and applied it successfully to many different materials, addressing problems like the structure of ice and the microscopic arrangements of magnetic moments in materials. For this achievement, Shull was awarded one half of the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics. (Wollan died in 1984). (The other half of the 1994 Nobel Prize for Physics went to Bert Brockhouse for development of the inelastic scattering technique at the Chalk River facility of AECL. This also involved the invention of the triple axis spectrometer).

=== 1950-60s === 
The development of neutron sources such as reactors and spallation sources emerged. This allowed high-intensity neutron beams, enabling advanced scattering experiments. Notably, the high flux isotope reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge and Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France, emerged as key institutions for neutron scattering studies.

===1970-80s === 
This period saw major advancements in neutron scattering techniques by developing techniques to explore different aspects of material science, structure and behaviour.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS):&quot; Used to investigate large-scale structural features in materials. The works of Glatter and Kratky also helped in the advancements of this method, though it was primarily developed for X-rays. &quot;

Inelastic neutron scattering (INS)&quot;: Provides insights into the dynamic process at the microscopic level. Majorly used to examine atomic and molecular motions.&quot;
===1990-present === 
Recent advancements focus on improved sources, using sophisticated detectors and enhanced computational techniques. Spallation sources have been developed at SNS (Spallation Neutron Source) in the U.S. and ISIS Neutron and Muon Source in the U.K., which can generate pulsed neutron beams for time-of-flight experiments. Neutron imaging and reflectometrywere also developed, which are powerful tools to analyse surfaces, interfaces and thin film structures, thus providing valuable insights into the material properties.

=== Processes ===
Neutrons are produced through three major processes, fission, spallation, and Low energy nuclear reactions.

==== Fission ====
In research reactors, fission takes place when a fissile nucleus, such as uranium-235 (235U), absorbs a neutron and subsequently splits into two smaller fragments. This process releases energy along with additional neutrons. On average, each fission event produces about 2.5 neutrons. While one neutron is required to maintain the chain reaction, the surplus neutrons can be utilized for various experimental applications.

==== Spallation ====
In spallation sources, high-energy protons (on the order of 1 GeV) bombard a heavy metal target (e.g., uranium (U), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), lead (Pb), or mercury (Hg)). This interaction causes the nuclei to spit out neutrons. Proton interactions result in around ten to thirty neutrons per event, of which the bulk are known as &quot;evaporation neutrons&quot;(~2 MeV), while a minority are identified as &quot;cascade neutrons&quot; with energies reaching up to the GeV range. Although spallation is a very efficient technique of neutron production, the technique generates high energy particles, therefore requiring shielding for safety.
==== Low energy nuclear reactions ====
Low-energy nuclear reactions are the basis of neutron production in accelerator-driven sources. The selected targetmaterials are based on the energy levels; lighter metals such as lithium (Li) and beryllium (Be) can be used toachieve their maximum possible reaction rate under 30 MeV, while heavier elements such as tungsten (W) and carbon (C) provide better performance above 312 MeV. These Compact Accelerator-driven Neutron Sources (CANS) have matured and are now approaching the performance of fission and spallation sources.

=== De-Broglie relation ===
Neutron scattering relies on the wave-particle dual nature of neutrons. The De-Broglie relation links the wavelength (&quot;λ&quot;) of a neutron to its energy (E)

formula_1

where: &quot;h&quot; is Planck’s constant, &quot;p&quot; is the momentum of the neutron, &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the neutron, &quot;v&quot; is the velocity of the neutron.

== Scattering ==
Neutron scattering is used to detect the distance between atoms and study the dynamics of materials. It involves two major principles: elastic scattering and inelastic scattering.

Elastic scattering provides insight into the structural properties of materials by looking at the angles at which neutrons are scattered. The resulting pattern of the scattering provides information regarding the atomic structure of crystals, liquids and amorphous materials.

Inelastic scattering focuses on material dynamics through the study of neutron energy and momentum changes during interactions. It is key to study phonons, magnons, and other excitations of solid materials.

== Neutron matter interaction ==
X- rays interact with matter through electrostatic interaction by interacting with the electron cloud of atoms, this limits their application as they can be scattered strongly from electrons. While being neutral, neutrons primarily interact with matter through the short-range strong force with atomic nuclei. Nuclei are far smaller than the electron cloud, meaning most materials are transparent to neutrons and allow deeper penetration. The interaction between neutrons and nuclei is described by the Fermi pseudopotential, that is, neutrons are well above their meson mass threshold, and thus can be treated effectively as point-like scatterers. While most elements have a low tendency to absorb neutrons, certain ones such as cadmium (Cd), gadolinium (Gd), helium (³He), lithium (⁶Li), and boron ( 10B) exhibit strong neutron absorption due to nuclear resonance effects. The likelihood of absorption increases with neutron wavelength (&quot;σₐ ∝ λ&quot;), meaning slower neutrons are absorbed more readily than faster ones.

==Instrumental and sample requirements==
The technique requires a source of neutrons. Neutrons are usually produced in a nuclear reactor or spallation source. At a research reactor, other components are needed, including a crystal monochromator (in the case of thermal neutrons), as well as filters to select the desired neutron wavelength. Some parts of the setup may also be movable. For the long-wavelength neutrons, crystals cannot be used and gratings are used instead as diffractive optical components. At a spallation source, the time of flight technique is used to sort the energies of the incident neutrons (higher energy neutrons are faster), so no monochromator is needed, but rather a series of aperture elements synchronized to filter neutron pulses with the desired wavelength.

The technique is most commonly performed as powder diffraction, which only requires a polycrystalline powder. Single crystal work is also possible, but the crystals must be much larger than those that are used in single-crystal X-ray crystallography. It is common to use crystals that are about 1 mm3.

The technique also requires a device that can detect the neutrons after they have been scattered.

Summarizing, the main disadvantage to neutron diffraction is the requirement for a nuclear reactor. For single crystal work, the technique requires relatively large crystals, which are usually challenging to grow. The advantages to the technique are many - sensitivity to light atoms, ability to distinguish isotopes, absence of radiation damage, as well as a penetration depth of several cm

==Nuclear scattering==
Like all quantum particles, neutrons can exhibit wave phenomena typically associated with light or sound. Diffraction is one of these phenomena; it occurs when waves encounter obstacles whose size is comparable with the wavelength. If the wavelength of a quantum particle is short enough, atoms or their nuclei can serve as diffraction obstacles. When a beam of neutrons emanating from a reactor is slowed and selected properly by their speed, their wavelength lies near one angstrom (0.1 nanometer), the typical separation between atoms in a solid material. Such a beam can then be used to perform a diffraction experiment. Impinging on a crystalline sample, it will scatter under a limited number of well-defined angles, according to the same Bragg&#x27;s law that describes X-ray diffraction.

Neutrons and X-rays interact with matter differently. X-rays interact primarily with the electron cloud surrounding each atom. The contribution to the diffracted x-ray intensity is therefore larger for atoms with larger atomic number (Z). On the other hand, neutrons interact directly with the &quot;nucleus&quot; of the atom, and the contribution to the diffracted intensity depends on each isotope; for example, regular hydrogen and deuterium contribute differently. It is also often the case that light (low Z) atoms contribute strongly to the diffracted intensity, even in the presence of large Z atoms. The scattering length varies from isotope to isotope rather than linearly with the atomic number. An element like vanadium strongly scatters X-rays, but its nuclei hardly scatters neutrons, which is why it is often used as a container material. Non-magnetic neutron diffraction is directly sensitive to the positions of the nuclei of the atoms.

The nuclei of atoms, from which neutrons scatter, are tiny. Furthermore, there is no need for an atomic form factor to describe the shape of the electron cloud of the atom and the scattering power of an atom does not fall off with the scattering angle as it does for X-rays. Diffractograms therefore can show strong, well-defined diffraction peaks even at high angles, particularly if the experiment is done at low temperatures. Many neutron sources are equipped with liquid helium cooling systems that allow data collection at temperatures down to 4.2 K. The superb high angle (i.e. high &quot;resolution&quot;) information means that the atomic positions in the structure can be determined with high precision. On the other hand, Fourier maps (and to a lesser extent difference Fourier maps) derived from neutron data suffer from series termination errors, sometimes so much that the results are meaningless.

==Magnetic scattering==
Although neutrons are uncharged, they carry a magnetic moment, and therefore interact with magnetic moments, including those arising from the electron cloud around an atom. Neutron diffraction can therefore reveal the microscopic magnetic structure of a material.

Magnetic scattering does require an atomic form factor as it is caused by the much larger electron cloud around the tiny nucleus. The intensity of the magnetic contribution to the diffraction peaks will therefore decrease towards higher angles.

==Uses==
Neutron diffraction can be used to determine the static structure factor of gases, liquids or amorphous solids. Most experiments, however, aim at the structure of crystalline solids, making neutron diffraction an important tool of crystallography.

Neutron diffraction is closely related to X-ray powder diffraction. In fact, the single crystal version of the technique is less commonly used because currently available neutron sources require relatively large samples and large single crystals are hard or impossible to come by for most materials. Future developments, however, may well change this picture. Because the data is typically a 1D powder diffractogram they are usually processed using Rietveld refinement. In fact the latter found its origin in neutron diffraction (at Petten in the Netherlands) and was later extended for use in X-ray diffraction.

One practical application of elastic neutron scattering/diffraction is that the lattice constant of metals and other crystalline materials can be very accurately measured. Together with an accurately aligned micropositioner a map of the lattice constant through the metal can be derived. This can easily be converted to the stress field experienced by the material. This has been used to analyse stresses in aerospace and automotive components to give just two examples. The high penetration depth permits measuring residual stresses in bulk components as crankshafts, pistons, rails, gears. This technique has led to the development of dedicated stress diffractometers, such as the ENGIN-X instrument at the ISIS neutron source.

Neutron diffraction can also be employed to give insight into the 3D structure any material that diffracts.

Another use is for the determination of the solvation number of ion pairs in electrolytes solutions.

The magnetic scattering effect has been used since the establishment of the neutron diffraction technique to quantify magnetic moments in materials, and study the magnetic dipole orientation and structure. One of the earliest applications of neutron diffraction was in the study of magnetic dipole orientations in antiferromagnetic transition metal oxides such as manganese, iron, nickel, and cobalt oxides. These experiments, first performed by Clifford Shull, were the first to show the existence of the antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic dipoles in a material structure. Now, neutron diffraction continues to be used to characterize newly developed magnetic materials.

===Hydrogen, null-scattering and contrast variation===
Neutron diffraction can be used to establish the structure of low atomic number materials like proteins and surfactants much more easily with lower flux than at a synchrotron radiation source. This is because some low atomic number materials have a higher cross section for neutron interaction than higher atomic weight materials.

One major advantage of neutron diffraction over X-ray diffraction is that the latter is rather insensitive to the presence of hydrogen (H) in a structure, whereas the nuclei 1H and 2H (i.e. Deuterium, D) are strong scatterers for neutrons. The greater scattering power of protons and deuterons means that the position of hydrogen in a crystal and its thermal motions can be determined with greater precision by neutron diffraction. The structures of metal hydride complexes, e.g., Mg2FeH6 have been assessed by neutron diffraction.

The neutron scattering lengths &quot;b&quot;H = −3.7406(11) fm and &quot;b&quot;D = 6.671(4) fm, for H and D respectively, have opposite sign, which allows the technique to distinguish them. In fact there is a particular isotope ratio for which the contribution of the element would cancel, this is called null-scattering.

It is undesirable to work with the relatively high concentration of H in a sample. The scattering intensity by H-nuclei has a large inelastic component, which creates a large continuous background that is more or less independent of scattering angle. The elastic pattern typically consists of sharp Bragg reflections if the sample is crystalline. They tend to drown in the inelastic background. This is even more serious when the technique is used for the study of liquid structure. Nevertheless, by preparing samples with different isotope ratios, it is possible to vary the scattering contrast enough to highlight one element in an otherwise complicated structure. The variation of other elements is possible but usually rather expensive. Hydrogen is inexpensive and particularly interesting, because it plays an exceptionally large role in biochemical structures and is difficult to study structurally in other ways.

== Applications ==

=== Study of hydrogen storage materials ===
Since neutron diffraction is particularly sensitive to lighter elements like hydrogen, it can be used for its detection. It can play a role in determining the crystal structure and hydrogen binding sites within metal hydrides, a class of materials of interest for hydrogen storage applications. The order of hydrogen atoms in the lattice reflects the storage capacity and kinetics of the material.

=== Magnetic structure determination ===
Neutron diffraction is also a useful technique for determining magnetic structures in materials, as neutrons can interact with magnetic moments. It can be used to determine the antiferromagnetic structure of manganese oxide (MnO) using neutron diffraction. Neutron Diffraction Studies can be used to measure the magnetic moment. Orientation study demonstrates how neutron diffraction can detect the precise alignment of the magnetic moment in materials, something that is much more challenging with X-rays.

=== Phase transition in ferroelectrics ===
Neutron diffraction has been widely employed to understand phase transitions in materials including ferroelectrics, which show the transition of crystal structure with temperature or pressure. It can be utilised to study the ferroelectric phase transition in lead titanate (PbTiO₃). It can be used to analyse atomic displacements and corresponding lattice distortions.  

=== Residual stress analysis in engineering materials ===
Neutron diffraction can be used as a technique for the nondestructive assessment of residual stresses in engineering materials, including metals and alloys. Also used for measuring residual stresses in engineering materials.

=== Lithium-ion batteries ===
Neutron diffraction is especially useful for the investigation of lithium-ion battery materials, because lithium atoms are almost opaque to X-ray radiation. It can further be used to investigate the structural evolution of lithium-ion battery cathode materials during charge and discharge cycles.

=== High temperature superconductors ===
Neutron diffraction has played an important role in revealing the crystal and magnetic structures in high-temperature superconductors. A neutron diffraction study of magnetic order in the high-temperature superconductor YBa₂Cu₃O₆+x was done. The work of each of these scientific teams together with others across the globe has revealed the origins of the relationship between magnetic ordering and superconductivity, delivering crucial insights into the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity.

=== Mechanical behaviour of alloys ===
Advancements in neutron diffraction have facilitated in situ investigations into the mechanical deformation of alloys under load, permitting observations on the mechanisms of deformation. The deformation behavior of titanium alloysunder mechanical loads can be investigated using in situ neutron diffraction. This technique allows real-time monitoring of lattice strains and phase transformations throughout deformation.
=== Neutron diffraction for ion channels ===
Neutron diffraction can be used to study ion channels, highlighting how neutrons interact with biological structures to reveal atomic details. Neutron diffraction is particularly sensitive to light elements like hydrogen, making it ideal for mapping water molecules, ion positions, and hydrogen bonds within the channel. By analysing neutron scattering patterns, researchers can determine ion binding sites, hydration structures, and conformational changes essential for ion transport and selectivity.


== Current developments in neutron diffraction ==

=== Advancements in Neutron Diffraction Research ===
Neutron diffraction has made significant progress, particularly at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which operates a suite of 12 diffractometers—seven at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and five at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). These instruments are designed for different applications and are grouped into three categories: powder diffraction, single crystal diffraction, and advanced diffraction techniques.

To further enhance neutron diffraction research, ORNL is undertaking several key projects:
* Expansion of the SNS First Target Station: New beamlines equipped with state-of-the-art instruments are being installed to broaden the scope of scientific investigations.
* Proton Power Upgrade: This initiative aims to double the proton power used for neutron production, which will enhance research efficiency, allow for the study of smaller and more complex samples, and support the eventual development of a next-generation neutron source at SNS.
* Development of the SNS Second Target Station: A new facility is being constructed to house 22 beamlines, making it a leading source for cold neutron research, crucial for studying soft matter, biological systems, and quantum materials.
* Enhancements at HFIR: Planned upgrades include optimizing the cold neutron guide hall to improve experimental capabilities, expanding isotope production (including plutonium-238 for space exploration), and enhancing the performance of existing instruments.

These advancements are set to significantly improve neutron diffraction techniques, allowing for more precise and detailed analysis of material structures. By expanding research capabilities and increasing neutron production efficiency, these developments will support a wide range of scientific fields, from materials science to energy research and quantum physics.

=== Modern trends in neutron scattering information technology ===
Neutron diffraction technology is evolving rapidly, with a focus on improving beam intensity and instrument efficiency. Modern instruments are designed to produce smaller, more intense beams, enabling high-precision studies of smaller samples, which is particularly beneficial for new material research. Advanced detectors, such as boron-based alternatives to helium-3, are being developed to address material shortages, while improved neutron spin manipulation enhances the study of magnetic and structural properties. Computational advancements, including simulations and virtual instruments, are optimizing neutron sources, streamlining experimental design, and integrating machine learning for data analysis. Multiplexing and event-based acquisition systems are enhancing data collection by capturing multiple datasets simultaneously. Additionally,next-generation spallation sources like the European Spallation Source (ESS) and Oak Ridge’s Second Target Station (STS) are increasing neutron production efficiency. Lastly, the rise of remote-controlled experiments and automation is improving accessibility and precision in neutron diffraction research.

=== Current trends in structural biology ===
Modern advancements in neutron diffraction are enhancing data precision, broadening structural research applications, and refining experimental methodologies. A key focus is the improved visualization of hydrogen atoms in biological macromolecules, crucial for studying enzymatic activity and hydrogen bonding. The expansion of specialized diffractometers has increased accessibility in structural biology, with techniques like monochromatic, quasi-Laue, and time-of-flight methods being optimized for efficiency. Innovations in sample preparation, particularly protein deuteration, are minimizing background noise and reducing the need for large crystals. Additionally, computational tools, including quantum chemical modeling, are aiding in the interpretation of complex molecular interactions. Improved neutron sources, such as spallation facilities, along with advanced detectors, are further boosting measurement accuracy and structural resolution. These developments are solidifying neutron diffraction as a critical technique for exploring the molecular architecture of biological systems.

<text>The Gulfstream III, a business jet produced by Gulfstream Aerospace, is an improved variant of the Grumman Gulfstream II.

The U.S. military uses versions of the Gulfstream III as the C-20A/B/C/D/E aircraft, though later C-20 F/G/H/J are Gulfstream IV.

==Design and development==
The Gulfstream III was built at Savannah, Georgia, in the United States and was designed as an improved variant of the Grumman Gulfstream II. Design studies were performed by Grumman Aerospace Corporation in collaboration with Gulfstream American Corporation. Design of the Gulfstream III started with an effort to synthesize a completely new wing employing NASA supercritical airfoil sections and winglets. Optimization studies considering weight, drag, fuel volume, cost, and performance indicated that a substantial portion of the new wing benefit could be secured with modifications to the existing wing. As a result, the new wing concept was canceled and work began on design modifications that would retain the Gulfstream II wing box structure and trailing edge surfaces.

Compared to the G-1159 Gulfstream II, the wing has more span and winglets added, the leading edge is longer and its contour is modified. The fuselage is longer aft of the main door, the radome is extended and there is a new curved windshield. Maximum takeoff weight is increased to or and there are various changes to the autopilot, flight instruments, and engine instruments. The aircraft received its type certificate from the American Federal Aviation Administration on 22 September 1980. A total of 202 Gulfstream IIIs were built, with the last example built in 1986.

In 2013, the FAA modified 14 CFR part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not stage 3 noise compliant after December 31, 2015. The Gulfstream III is listed explicitly in Federal Register 78 FR 39576. Any Gulfstream IIIs that have not been modified by installing Stage 3 noise compliant engines or have not had &quot;hushkits&quot; installed for non-compliant engines will not be permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after December 31, 2015. &quot;14 CFR §91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less&quot; – lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after December 31, 2015.

By 2018, prices for a used 1982 Gulfstream III started at $695,000.

==Variants==

===Civil variants===

* Model G-1159A Gulfstream III - Two or three-crew executive, corporate transport aircraft, powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines.

===Military variants===
* C-20A - United States Air Force variant configured for 14 passengers and five crew; phased out of USAF service in 2002, one example transferred to NASA for use at the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base as a test aircraft.
* C-20B - United States Air Force and United States Coast Guard variant with upgraded electronics, used for Special Air Missions (SAM); the single Coast Guard C-20B was used by the Commandant of the Coast Guard and other senior USCG officials as well as the Secretary of Homeland Security.
* C-20C - United States Air Force C-20B with upgraded and &quot;hardened&quot; secure communications, often utilized as backup aircraft accompanying the VC-25A aircraft when it is operating as Air Force One
* C-20D - United States Navy Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft with modified communications equipment for use by the Navy, normally in support of high-ranking naval officials
* C-20E - Stretched fuselage/redesigned wing variant for use by the United States Army as an Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft
* Gulfstream III SRA-1 - Special reconnaissance and surveillance version for export.
* Gulfstream III SMA-3 - Export model for Denmark, fitted with a Texas Instruments APS-127 search radar. Three maritime reconnaissance and patrol, fisheries protection, search and rescue, and VIP transport aircraft were built for the Royal Danish Air Force in 1983. No longer in service.

NOTE: United States Army C-20F and C-20J, United States Navy/United States Marine Corps C-20G, and United States Air Force C-20H aircraft are all Gulfstream IV variants

==Special mission variants==
A NASA Gulfstream C-20A (83-0502 cn 389) has been fitted with a centerline pylon to allow it to carry the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) pod.

A NASA Gulfstream III (N992NA cn 309) has also been fitted with a centerline pylon to allow it to carry the Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) pod, a modification of the UAVSAR pod.

The Phoenix Air Group operates two former Royal Danish Air Force SMA-3 aircraft (N173PA cn 313, N163PA cn 249) and a Gulfstream III (N186PA cn 317). One aircraft provides airborne maritime range surveillance for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other Department of Defense range facilities using a high definition Texas Instruments APS-127 Surface Search Radar system. All three are configured with a large cargo door. In 2008 Phoenix Air developed an Airborne Biomedical Containment System with the CDC. In 2014, the system was deployed during the Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia to fly 12 ebola missions to the United States.

N30LX (cn 438) has been modified by the addition of a ventral canoe and sensor turret as the &quot;Dragon Star&quot; Airborne Multi-Intelligence Laboratory for use by Lockheed Martin. This has been leased by Italy since 2012.

Calspan operates N710CF (cn 448), which has been modified as an airborne test bed. Modifications include a centerline pylon and a dorsal satcom radome

Two Gulfstream IIIs, K2961 (cn 494) and K2962 (cn 495), equipped with long-range oblique photography cameras mounted in the fuselage, were delivered to the Indian Air Force.

<text>The Tar River is a river that is approximately long, in northeast North Carolina flowing generally southeast to an estuary of Pamlico Sound. The Tar River becomes the tidal Pamlico River once it passes under the U.S. Highway 17 Bridge in Washington, North Carolina.

North Carolina was originally a naval stores colony—that is, the blanket of longleaf pines that covered the coastal plain was used by the British Navy for ships&#x27; masts and the pine pitch was used to manufacture tar caulking for vessels. The river derives its name from its historic use as a major route for tar-laden barges as they headed to the sea. The city of Tarboro is on the banks of the river. Recent research conducted by East Carolina University, Greenville and Pitt County historians has uncovered documentation noting that before the Civil War, the North Carolina Legislature had appropriated funds to construct dams and locks on the Tar River in an attempt to facilitate almost year-round navigation for the farm products and naval stores shipping plus passenger boats which were travelling between Tarboro, Greenville, and Washington.
Among the towns and cities along its course are Louisburg, Rocky Mount, Tarboro, and Greenville. The village of Old Sparta was formerly an important riverport on the Tar, but declined in the 20th century.

One account of the significance of the river&#x27;s name comes from the Civil War.

It may have been inspired by an incident back in North Carolina. As the Confederates prepared to evacuate Washington, NC, in March 1862, they sent squads up and down the Tar River to destroy all the stocks of cotton and naval stores which had been prepared by the small farms along the river, to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Union soldiers. At Taft’s store they found over 1,000 barrels of turpentine and tar. The amount was too large to burn, as it would take several houses with it. So the barrels were rolled into the river, where the hoops were cut in two and the contents dumped into the river. Three months later, in June, four hundred Union prisoners of war were sent from Salisbury, NC to Washington, NC, to be exchanged for Confederate prisoners. Before coming into Washington, the soldiers asked permission to bathe in the river and clean themselves up. Guards were posted along the river banks, and the prisoners were allowed to strip then wade into the river to wash. Instead, they stirred up the river bottom so much that the tar smeared their bodies completely, each man coming out of the water with a stick to scour the tar off their bodies and legs. One Confederate yelled out, &quot;Hello boys, what’s the matter?&quot; The reply from the disgusted Yankee soldier was, &quot;We have heard of Tar River all our lives but never believed that there really was any such place, but damned if we haven’t found it, the whole bed of it is tar!&quot;

The river was strongly affected by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and caused much flooding in the area. The Tar River suffered the worst flooding from the hurricane, exceeding 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches; it crested 24 feet (7.3 m) above flood stage. In Greenville it crested at 29.74 ft. (9.1 m)

The river was again affected by Hurricane Matthew in 2016. It crested as much as above flood stage in some areas for up to 3 days.

An endangered species, the Tar River Spinymussel, is found in limited areas of the Tar and Neuse River basins.

Sound Rivers, an environmental organization dedicated to the protection of the Tar and Neuse watersheds, maintains fifteen camping platforms and campsites for recreation along the course of the Tar-Pamlico Water Trail.

<text>Mute Records is a British independent record label owned and founded in 1978 by Daniel Miller. It has featured several prominent musical acts on its roster such as Depeche Mode, Erasure, Einstürzende Neubauten, Fad Gadget, Goldfrapp, Grinderman, Inspiral Carpets, Moby, New Order, Laibach, Nitzer Ebb, Yann Tiersen, Wire, Yeasayer, Fever Ray, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Yazoo, and M83.

==History==

===Beginnings===
During 1978, Daniel Miller began recording music, using synthesisers, under the name The Normal. He recorded the tracks &quot;T.V.O.D.&quot; and &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; and distributed them through Rough Trade Shops under the label name Mute Records. The label was formed initially just to release the one single. &quot;T.V.O.D.&quot;/&quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; became a cult hit ensuring the future of the label. &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; was later covered by Grace Jones and Chicks on Speed as well as Rose McDowell.

After meeting Robert Rental (who had previously worked with Thomas Leer), Miller began recording and playing live as Robert Rental &amp; The Normal. In 1979 the band went on tour supporting the punk band Stiff Little Fingers, which had just released an album distributed by Rough Trade.

===1980–1989===
In 1980, Miller released the single &quot;Kebab-Träume&quot; by the German band Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft (D.A.F.), who had recently moved to London. The band&#x27;s 1980 album, &quot;Die Kleinen und die Bösen&quot;, was the first album released by the new label. The album had the catalogue prefix &quot;STUMM&quot;, a play on the record label&#x27;s name, meaning &quot;mute&quot; in German. This prefix was used through most of the label&#x27;s album catalogue.

Also in 1980, Miller recorded and released the cover single &quot;Memphis Tennessee&quot; under the name Silicon Teens. The band was Miller&#x27;s realisation of a dream Mute Records group whose main instruments were synthesisers. In mid-1980, Mute Records released the Silicon Teens&#x27; album, titled &quot;Music For Parties&quot;.

Around this time the artist Fad Gadget had begun recording new demos, including the track &quot;Back To Nature&quot;. This was released as a single in 1980, followed by the next single &quot;Ricky&#x27;s Hand&quot; and the album &quot;Fireside Favourites&quot; recorded at Blackwing Studios.

September 1980 saw the release of the double-holed, multi-speed 7&quot; single by Non &amp; Smegma, one of the first experimental noise releases from the label. Boyd Rice (Non) went on to release several more recordings with Mute Records. After touring with Daniel Miller as Robert Rental &amp; The Normal, Robert Rental released his only Mute Records single, &quot;Double Heart&quot;, a rare remaining trace of this late electronic music pioneer.

Miller approached Depeche Mode in 1980, after seeing them perform in London, wanting them to record a single for his label; that first single was &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot;. Emerging out of the British electronic pop scene, Depeche Mode quickly asserted themselves as a radio-friendly pop group, and they had hits with their next three singles, including the UK top ten single &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;. Their loyalty to Mute was reciprocated by the label&#x27;s rapid expansion to cope with their success. In defiance of the major record labels&#x27; predictions of failure, Depeche Mode became successful worldwide, even after the departure of principal songwriter Vince Clarke. Martin Gore took over the main songwriting role, opening the band up to different influences and sustaining their creativity.

Mute continued to support other experimental artists, such as NON, releasing an album of Boyd Rice&#x27;s pre-NON recordings, titled &quot;Boyd Rice&quot;. 1982 began with the release of the 12-inch single, &quot;Rise&quot;, by Boyd Rice, released under the name NON.

Fad Gadget released his third album for the label, titled &quot;Under the Flag&quot;, influenced by the current Falklands War and the feeling of being British in the most unseemly of times. The album spawned the singles &quot;For Whom the Bells Toll&quot; and &quot;Life on the Line&quot;.

Mute Record&#x27;s big commercial success of 1982 was the band Yazoo, the duo of Vince Clarke and Alison Moyet. After leaving Depeche Mode, Clarke had set up a studio in the Blackwing Studios complex, where he recorded the singles &quot;Only You&quot; and &quot;Don’t Go&quot;.
That year, Mute licensed the single &quot;Fred Vom Jupiter&quot; from the German record label Atatak. The track was recorded by Holger Hiller, Andreas Dorau and the schoolgirl Marinas. Also from Germany was the single &quot;Los Ninos Del Parque&quot;, by Liaisons Dangereuses, later released by Mute. Liaisons Dangereuses included Chrislo Hass, who had previously been in the German band DAF.

After returning from a world tour in 1983, Depeche Mode released the industrial-influenced hit single &quot;Everything Counts&quot;. Bruce Gilbert and Graham Lewis, of the band Wire (who had been working together under the name Dome), teamed up with Daniel Miller to form a project known as Duet Emmo, an anagram of Mute and Dome. They released an album and 12-inch single, both titled &quot;Or So It Seems&quot;. Miller also secured the rights to the back catalogue of the experimental bands Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire and Richard H. Kirk

During 1983, the Australian band The Birthday Party transferred from 4AD to Mute Records. The band broke up after releasing their final 12-inch EP, &quot;Mutiny&quot;. Birthday Party&#x27;s singer, Nick Cave, stayed with Mute and released his debut single as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The single was a cover of the song &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;, by Mac Davis, previously made famous by Elvis Presley. Yazoo released the album &quot;You and Me Both&quot; that year and disbanded. Vince Clarke then began working at Blackwing Studios under the name The Assembly. The project&#x27;s first single, &quot;Never Never&quot;, was a hit, featuring Feargal Sharkey on vocals.

D.A.F. split up, and in 1983, ex-member Robert Görl released the single &quot;Mit Dir&quot; on Mute. He recorded the album &quot;Night Full of Tension&quot; the following year, including the single &quot;Darling Don’t Leave Me&quot;, featuring Annie Lennox. In 1984, Depeche Mode had one of their biggest hits in the UK with the single &quot;People Are People&quot;. Their album that year, &quot;Some Great Reward&quot;, reached number one in Germany and became their first hit in the United States.

Mute released an album of archive material from the German band Einstürzende Neubauten, titled &quot;Strategies Against Architecture &#x27;80–&#x27;83&quot;, compiled by Jim Thirlwell. Mute used Berlin as a recording location at this time. Einstürzende Neubauten member F.M. Einheit contributed on the recording of the Fad Gadget album &quot;Gag&quot;, along with Rowland S. Howard (ex-guitarist for The Birthday Party), who also contributed to the 1983 Fad Gadget single &quot;I Discover Love&quot;. Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s Blixa Bargeld began working with Nick Cave at this time, playing guitar with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The resulting 1984 album, &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;, included a cover of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song, &quot;Avalanche&quot;.

In 1984, Bruce Gilbert extended his field of music into dance after a commission to write music for dancer Michael Clark. Gilbert recorded with engineer John Fryer at Blackwing Studios. The recordings were documented by Mute on the album, &quot;This Way&quot;.

The synth duo I Start Counting released their debut single, &quot;Letters to a Friend&quot;, in June 1984, produced by Daniel Miller. In subsequent years, the band would also record for the label under the names Fortran 5, John Came and Komputer. 1984 ended with the long delayed release of &quot;Easy Listening for the Hard of Hearing&quot; by Frank Tovey and Boyd Rice. The album was originally recorded at Blackwing Studios in May 1981, using sounds created from non-musical appliances, and other studio-generated sounds. The recordings were engineered by John Fryer and Eric Radcliffe.

In 1985, a new incarnation of Simon Bonney&#x27;s Crime &amp; the City Solution formed, including ex-Birthday Party members Mick Harvey and Rowland S. Howard. The new line-up released the EP &quot;The Dangling Man&quot; and later the mini-album &quot;Just South of Heaven&quot;. Mute released the single &quot;Hypnotized&quot; in May 1985, by newly signed artist Mark Stewart, produced by Adrian Sherwood. Stewart recorded his first album for Mute, &quot;As the Veneer of Democracy Starts to Fade&quot;, in November 1985, also produced by Sherwood, under the name Mark Stewart and the Mafia. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released their second album, &quot;The Firstborn Is Dead&quot;, recorded at the Berlin recording studio, Hansa Tonstudio, co-produced by Flood.

Fad Gadget began recording as Frank Tovey in 1985 and released the single &quot;Luxury&quot; in August that year, co-produced with Daniel Miller. Vince Clarke and Andy Bell began recording as Erasure in 1985, and released their debut album the next year.

Frank Tovey released his first album under his own name after leaving his Fad Gadget moniker behind him. The new album was titled &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;. The initial release included a twelve-inch single containing four Fad Gadget tracks.

To celebrate five years of Depeche Mode, Mute released a compilation album of the band&#x27;s singles, &quot;The Singles 81→85&quot;. A remastered edition was issued in October 1998 with additional tracks, including an original version of the song &quot;Photographic&quot;, released on Some Bizzare Records. Wire member Graham Lewis launched his project in 1985, known as He Said, with Mute releasing the project&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Only One I&quot;. Lewis released his debut album the following year after two more singles.

Erasure released the single &quot;Sometimes&quot; in 1986, and it became a UK top ten hit. I Start Counting finished recording their debut album, &quot;My Translucent Hands&quot;, in this same year. Wire re-grouped to record a 12-inch single, &quot;Snakedrill&quot;, produced by Daniel Miller and Gareth Jones. Band member Bruce Gilbert went on to produce the 12-inch single &quot;Just Talk&quot;, for A.C. Marias.

Two Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds albums were released in 1986. The first was Kicking Against the Pricks, a collection of covers including &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; and &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotten Hold of My Heart&quot;. The second album released in November 1986 was &quot;Your Funeral... My Trial&quot;.

Mute signed the American female singer Diamanda Galás who in her first year with Mute released &quot;The Divine Punishment&quot; and &quot;Saint of the Pit&quot;.

Mute carried out a licensing deal with the Japanese company Wave. This gave Mute the rights to release the Japanese financed album titled &quot;Oben Im Eck&quot; by Holger Hiller; the album was released in November 1986.

Crime &amp; the City Solution released new material in 1986 including the album &quot;Room of Lights&quot; and the twelve inch single &quot;Kentucky Click/Adventure&quot;. The new album won the band acclaim in the European press showing the Australian band&#x27;s growing popularity across Europe.

The end of 1986 saw Mute Records sign the Yugoslav band Laibach. The following year Mute released the band&#x27;s album &quot;Opus Dei&quot;, which included the cover single, &quot;Life is Life&quot;. Also at the end of 1986 the band Wire returned to the studio with producer Gareth Jones. In 1987 Mute released the result of the studio sessions, the album &quot;The Ideal Copy&quot;.

1987 saw Depeche Mode recording and working with a new producer Dave Bascombe. In September, Mute released &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;. The album was supported by a world tour. During the promotional tour for the new album, Depeche Mode became increasingly popular in the musical mainstream. The 101st concert they performed was recorded and made into a film, documenting one of their largest attended concerts. A live album of the concert was released in 1989 titled &quot;101&quot;. The Music for the Masses tour saw new Mute artists Nitzer Ebb performing as a supporting act. They had already released two singles with Mute before releasing their debut album, &quot;That Total Age&quot;, in May 1987.

===1990–2001===
Mute released Mark Stewart&#x27;s album, &quot;Metatron&quot;, in May 1990, which included the single, &quot;Hysteria&quot;. Stewart continued working with producer Adrian Sherwood. Mute signed Goldfrapp in 1999, consisting of Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory. The duo began recording their debut album, &quot;Felt Mountain&quot;, in a hired cottage in Wiltshire, South West England. Goldfrapp completed the recording after six months, and the album was released in September 2000.

Mute was one of the first British record labels to have an Internet presence, entitled Mute Liberation Technologies. This started out running as an FTP site, Telnet site and a bulletin board system in 1994. They continued to be run in tandem for a number of years until they were shut down. Mute Liberation Technologies has been running as a website since 1995. A newer version of the site was launched in July 2004.

In 2001, Rough Trade Records celebrated the 25th anniversary of the opening of their first retail shop. To mark the anniversary, Mute released the &quot;Rough Trade Shops 25 Years&quot; four CD box set. The album release coincided with ten days of special live events across London. Tracks appearing on the box set were carefully chosen to represent some of the most popular records sold during the past twenty five years at Rough Trade shops; these included recordings by Nick Cave, Joy Division and Stereolab.

===2002–2009, the EMI years===
In May 2002, Mute Records was bought by EMI for £23m. The deal was finalized even though one in four acts signed by EMI faced being dropped by the label after job cuts in March 2002. Daniel Miller remained in charge of the company&#x27;s global activities.
During that period, the label released eleven CDs of music by The Residents. Some CDs were rereleases of albums previously published on Ralph Records in the 70s and 80s and some new work from the San Francisco&#x27;s group such as Animal Lover and The Voice of Midnight.

Mute released the single &quot;Dirty Sticky Floors&quot; in May 2003, from Depeche Mode singer Dave Gahan&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Paper Monsters&quot;. Gahan debuted as a songwriter on the album, written and recorded along with Gahan&#x27;s friend, Knox Chandler. Mute released another Depeche Mode solo project that year, &quot;Counterfeit²&quot; by Martin Gore, a collection of cover songs recorded at Gore&#x27;s home studio. The eleven tracks on the album included songs that were recorded originally by Iggy Pop, John Lennon, and Brian Eno.

===2010===
Goldfrapp released their fifth album, &quot;Head First&quot;, in March 2010. Recorded in 2009 in Bath and London, the album included the singles &quot;Rocket&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot;.

The American band Liars also released a new album in March 2010, &quot;Sisterworld&quot;, which included the single &quot;Scissor&quot;, as a digital download.

In September 2010, EMI and Daniel Miller reached an agreement in which EMI would support Miller in the establishment of a second record label. The Mute brand once again became an independent record label as Mute Artists Ltd. The new label would operate under the Mute trademark, which would be licensed by EMI and will be supported by EMI via services such as sales, licensing, and distribution. Daniel Miller was given full control of the new label, which left EMI with a minority equity interest in the company. To help fund the new label, EMI licensed part of the Mute back catalogue, also giving support in areas such as royalty administration and business affairs. Current Mute artists such as Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, and Goldfrapp remained signed to and marketed by EMI Music. Many other bands, including Erasure and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds moved over to Miller&#x27;s new independent label.

October 2010 saw the release of &quot;Dust Lane&quot; by the French artist Yann Tiersen. The album incorporated vintage electronic sounds and textures recorded over two years in France and the Philippines. In November Mute released Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s fourth album in the &quot;Strategies Against Architecture&quot; series. The album continues with an archive compilation of the band&#x27;s output from 2002 to 2010.

===2012===
In 2012, albums by Cold Specks, Liars, Crime &amp; the City Solution, and Soulsavers were released, among others.

The Germany-based BMG Rights Management acquired the original Mute back catalogue from Universal in December 2012, as part of the regulator-forced sale of European assets belonging to EMI Music that were acquired by Universal Music in September 2012. EMI kept the rights of the Mute archives when Miller took the company independent in 2010. In May 2013, the EC approved the catalogue acquisition. Months after acquiring the Mute catalogue, BMG selected INgrooves to distribute the catalogue in North America, PIAS Recordings for all other territories, and Sony Music Entertainment to distribute Depeche Mode.

===2014===
In the aftermath of the Universal&#x27;s acquisition of EMI, in February 2014, Mute left Caroline Distribution, once part of former parent EMI, and signed a new USA distribution deal with Alternative Distribution Alliance, returning to Warner Music Group, which was its American home 20 years prior. European distribution for Mute was now handled by PIAS.
In September 2014 New Order announced that it had signed with Mute Records for its tenth studio album.

===2017===
The wholly independent label continued to sign new artists such as Lee Ranaldo plus the catalogues Goldfrapps final studio album &quot;Silver Eye&quot;,Throbbing Gristle and A Certain Ratio plus released new albums from Erasure and Ben Frost amongst others. In November 2017, the book &#x27;Mute: A Visual Document: From 1978 – Tomorrow&#x27; was released in partnership with Thames &amp; Hudson, the book was named Book of the Year by Rough Trade. Additionally the label relaunched the legendary techno label NovaMute with releases from Nicolas Bougaïeff and Terence Fixmer.

<doc id="313273" wikidata="Q2033236" url="?curid=313273" title="Pamlico Sound">
<text>Pamlico Sound ( ) is a large estuarine lagoon in North Carolina. The largest lagoon along the North American East Coast, it extends long and wide. It is part of a large, interconnected network of similar lagoons that includes Albemarle Sound, Currituck Sound, Croatan Sound, Roanoke Sound, Pamlico Sound, Bogue Sound, Back Sound, and Core Sound known collectively as the Albemarle-Pamlico sound system. With over 3,000 sq. mi. (7,800 km2) of open water the combined estuary is second only in size to Chesapeake Bay in the United States. 

The Pamlico Sound is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by the Outer Banks, a row of low, sandy barrier islands that include Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Cape Lookout National Seashore, and Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge. The Albemarle-Pamlico Sound is one of nineteen great waters recognized by the America&#x27;s Great Waters Coalition.

== Hydrology ==

Pamlico Sound is connected to the north with Albemarle Sound through passages provided by the Roanoke Sound and Croatan Sound. Core Sound is located at the Pamlico&#x27;s narrow southern end. It is fed by the Neuse and Pamlico rivers (the latter of which is the estuary of the Tar River) from the west, and from the east by Oregon Inlet, Hatteras Inlet, and Ocracoke Inlet, which also provide passage to the Atlantic Ocean. The salinity of the sound averages 20 ppt, compared to an average coastal salinity of 35 ppt in the Atlantic and 3 ppt in the Currituck Sound, which is located north of the Albemarle Sound.

The sound and its ocean inlets are noted for wide expanses of shallow water and occasional shoaling, making the area hazardous for larger vessels. While the deepest hole of the estuary () can be found in the Pamlico Sound, depths generally range from . In addition, the shallow waters are susceptible to wind and barometric pressure-driven tidal fluctuations. This effect is amplified on the tributary rivers, where water levels can change by as much as two feet in three hours when winds are aligned with the rivers&#x27; axes and are blowing strongly.

== History and current use ==

In March 1524, Italian Explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano mistook the sound for the Pacific Ocean because of its wide expanse and separation from the Atlantic Ocean by the Outer Banks barrier islands. The sound was named for the Pamlico that lived along the sound&#x27;s mainland banks and who were referred to as the Pamouik by the Raleigh expeditions (circa 1584).

Three locations of Pamlico Sound in the Outer Banks between Cape Hatteras and Cape Fear were once under serious consideration by the United States Atomic Energy Commission as an atomic bomb test site during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Portions of Pamlico Sound are used as a bombing and training range for Camp Lejeune.

In 1987, Congress declared the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound an &quot;estuary of national significance.&quot; For vacationers to the Outer Banks, the Pamlico Sound is a &quot;watersports playground&quot; providing opportunities for fishing and crabbing, boating, kayaking, sailing, windsurfing, kiteboarding, parasailing, paddleboarding, and more. In 2012, the economic impact of tourism to the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound area exceeded $1.3 billion.

The sound also supports local commercial fishing, crabbing, shrimping, clamming, and oystering. 90% of North Carolina&#x27;s commercial fishing catches are attributed to the Pamlico Sound, generating almost $100 million per year.

== Wildlife ==

Along the coastal areas are numerous waterfowl nesting sites, including Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge on the Outer Banks, and Swanquarter National Wildlife Refuge on the mainland. Dolphins and sea turtles are abundant, with occasional visits by seals such as harp seal in early January and February. Many other cetaceans including rare species such as fin whales, Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales, and orcas are present off Outer Banks and Cape Hatteras. Whales such as Atlantic gray (now extirpated), North Atlantic right (critically endangered), and North Atlantic humpback were historically common. Endangered species such as leatherback turtles, whale sharks, and basking sharks are also known to visit the sound as well.

The sound also sports a variety of fish populations including red drum, speckled trout, flounder, striped bass (known as rockfish by local populations), croaker, spot, pompano, kingfish, and bluefish. In addition, shellfish populations including blue crab, shrimp, oysters, and clams are healthy.

<doc id="313274" wikidata="Q968242" url="?curid=313274" title="Hiraga Gennai">
<text>was a Japanese polymath and &quot;rōnin&quot; of the Edo period. He was a pharmacologist, student of &quot;Rangaku&quot;, author, painter and inventor well known for his &quot;Erekiteru&quot; (electrostatic generator), &quot;Kandankei&quot; (thermometer) and &quot;Kakanpu&quot; (asbestos cloth). Gennai composed several works of literature, including the fictional satires &quot;Fūryū Shidōken den&quot; (1763), the &quot;Nenashigusa&quot; (1763), and the &quot;Nenashigusa kohen&quot; (1768), and the satirical essays &quot;On Farting&quot; and &quot;A Lousy Journey of Love&quot;. He also authored two guidebooks on the male prostitutes of Japan, the &quot;Kiku no en&quot; (1764) and the &quot;San no asa&quot; (1768). His birth name was Shiraishi Kunitomo, but he later used numerous pen names, including , (his principal literary pen name), and . He is best known by the name Hiraga Gennai.

== Biography ==

===Family history===
Hiraga Gennai was born in 1729 in the village of Shidoura, Sanuki Province (part of the modern city of Sanuki, Kagawa). He was the third son of Shiroishi Mozaemon, a low-level provincial samurai in the service of the Takamatsu Domain. The Shiroishi clan traced their roots to Saku District in Shinano Province where they were local warlords with the surname of &quot;Hiraga&quot;. However, after they were defeated by the Takeda clan, they fled to Mutsu Province and entered the service of the Date clan, taking the new surname of &quot;Shiroishi&quot; from a location in Mutsu. They accompanied a cadet branch of the Date clan to Uwajima Domain in Shikoku, but eventually moved to Takamatsu where they supplemented their meagre income as a low-ranking samurai with farming. Gennai studied Confucianism and haiku poetry, and crafted &quot;kakejiku&quot; as a child in Takamatsu.

===Early life===
In 1741, Gennai began his studies as an herbalist and became an apprentice to a physician at the age of 12. Later at the age of 18 Gennai was offered an official position in the herb garden of the local . In 1748, his father died, and he became head of the family.

===Midlife===
====Life in Nagasaki====
In 1752, Gennai was sent to Nagasaki to study western medicine, including European pharmaceutical and surgical techniques and other &quot;rangaku&quot; topics. Two years later, he turned his house over to his younger sister&#x27;s husband. Nagasaki was at the time one of the only ports that foreign ships were allowed to enter and therefore the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) along with a host of Chinese traders resided in the port town, and there were able to do business under highly regulated supervision. The interaction that Gennai had with the Chinese merchants and members of the VOC introduced him to ceramics. The following year Gennai relocated to Osaka and Kyoto, where he studied herbal medicine under Toda Kyokuzan before moving to Edo in 1757.

====Life in Edo====
In Edo, he studied with Tamura Ransui, and with his oversight and support Gennai began to cultivate natural specimens of ginseng. This made the transition from imports of the medicinal herb to domestic production possible. While in Edo Gennai wrote a number of books, some on scientific or nature topics, some satirical novels, in the &quot;kokkeibon&quot; and &quot;dangibon&quot; genres. Gennai was an onna-girai and composed several works on the subject, including guidebooks on the male prostitutes of Edo and works of fiction exalting sex between men over heterosexuality.In his scientific experiments, Gennai prospected for various minerals, wove asbestos, calculated temperatures, and worked with static electricity. He returned to Nagasaki to study mining and the techniques of refining ores.

=====Mining=====
In 1761, he discovered iron deposits in Izu Province and worked as a broker to establish a mining venture. He also held exhibitions of his various inventions in Edo, and came to be known to Tanuma Okitsugu, a senior official in the Tokugawa shogunate, as well as the doctors Sugita Genpaku and Nakagawa Jun&#x27;an. In 1766, he assisted Kawagoe Domain to develop an asbestos mine in what is now part of Chichibu, Saitama. While these, he also studied techniques to improve the efficiency of charcoal furnaces and the construction of river boats.

=====Pottery=====
In 1772, while on a trip to Nagasaki, Gennai uncovered a store of clay; this led to him petitioning the government to allow him to manufacture pottery on a large scale, for both exports and domestic use.

He is quoted as having said:
Gennai made or instructed a number of Japanese pottery pieces which are named &quot;Gennai ware&quot; after him. The style is unique with brilliant colours, mostly three, following the Kōchi ware style from Gennai&#x27;s native island of Shikoku.

=====Teaching=====
In 1773, he was invited by Satake Yoshiatsu to Kubota Domain to teach mining engineering, and while in Dewa Province, also gave lessons in western oil painting.

===End of life===
Gennai was back in Edo by the summer of 1779, where he undertook repairs to a &quot;Daimyō&quot; mansion. His final days are surrounded in mystery. The most prevalent account is that he was arrested in late 1779 for killing two carpenters on the project in a drunken rage after they had accused him of stealing the plans for the mansion. He subsequently died in prison on January 24 of then following year of tetanus. Sugita Genpaku wanted to hold a funeral service, but this was denied for unknown reasons by the Shogunate, so Sugita held a memorial service with no body and with no tombstone. This has given rise to many theories over the years that Gennai had not actually died in prison, but had been spirited away, possibly by the intervention of Tanuma Okitsugu, and lived out the rest of his life somewhere in obscurity.

==Grave of Hiraga Gennai==

Despite the original prohibition on his funeral, Hiraga Gennai had a grave at the temple of Sosen-ji in Asakusabashi (currently Hashiba, Taitō-ku, Tokyo) . In 1928, following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the temple was relocated to Itabashi, but its cemetery remained behind. Behind his grave is the grave of Fukusuke, his long-time manservant, and next to the tombstone is a stone monument with an epitaph by Sugita Genpaku, his life-long friend. The tomb was reconstructed by Count Yorinaga Matsudaira in 1931. It received protection as a National Historic Site in 1943. The site is a 12-minute walk from Minami-Senju Station on the Hibiya Line; however, the grave is not open to the public.

In addition, Hiraga has a second grave at the Hiraga family &quot;bodaiji&quot; in Sanuki, Kagawa.

==Works==

===&quot;On Farting&quot;===
Gennai published many works over the course of his literary career. Perhaps one of the most well-known is &quot;On Farting&quot;, a satirical work which explored encounters between high and low culture in Ryōgoku, a popular entertainment district in Edo. Within this work, Gennai himself is depicted as having a &quot;spirited&quot; debate with a samurai about a peasant who had gained fame and popularity as a fart-ist, entertaining crowds with performances of flatulence. Gennai and his friends debate if a drug is being used by the artist that allows the performance to be possible. Gennai argues that the feat is impressive and commendably unique. Another character, a Confucian Samurai named Ishibe Kinkichirō, argues that, due to the rudeness of the act and the stupidity of viewers, encouraging the public performance of flatulence goes against the rules of Confucian etiquette. Through this extended dialogue, Gennai highlights the differences between these two conflicting value systems. For the Confucian samurai, the performance represents a serious offence against propriety and social order, whereas Gennai believes that it embodies wisdom and creativity. The two agree that a fart is nothing more than a useless discharge, and that it cannot compare to the officially sanctioned work traditionally labeled as &#x27;productive&#x27;, such as the mental work that comes with running Tokugawa society; however, they disagree on the meaning and implications of this discharge. Kinkichirō argues that it goes against everything that the &quot;true sages&quot; taught society about human decency and etiquette, but Gennai sees the fart-ist&#x27;s creativity and wisdom in being able to make such useless excess into music. By presenting it this way Gennai exposes a problem with the categorization of material and media as either high or low. Throughout the story, Gennai continues to critique both the concept of high culture and the attitude of its custodians.

===&quot;Rootless Grass&quot;===

Another of Gennai&#x27;s notable satirical works is &quot;Rootless Grass&quot;, in which &quot;Enma&quot;, the King of Hell, falls in love with an &quot;onnagata&quot;. In Gennai&#x27;s description of hell, it is a lively place, but is currently in the midst of a large construction project. This project is due to the need for more space, because of the massive growth in population that hell is experiencing. King Enma tasks the Dragon King with the retrieval of the &quot;onnagata&quot; Kinkunojō II, who has become the object of Enma&#x27;s affection. The Dragon King holds court to determine who will go to the mortal world to retrieve the &quot;onnagata&quot;. The court debates over which retainer should be the one to complete this task. In the end, the Dragon King sends the gatekeeper, a &quot;kappa&quot;. The &quot;kappa&quot; plans to seduce the actor and then drown him, in order to bring him back to hell. However, the &quot;kappa&quot; falls in love with the young actor. Not wanting to subject his lover to eternal suffering in hell, the &quot;kappa&quot; brings back a less attractive &quot;onnagata&quot; in an unsuccessful attempt to appease Enma. Enma then ventures out into the mortal realm to find Kinkunojō himself, but he is defeated in battle by the great hero actor Ichikawa Raizō I. It is then revealed that the whole story has actually been Raizō&#x27;s dream, foretelling his imminent death.

===&quot;A Lousy Journey of Love&quot;===
Continuing the theme of satirical publications, Gennai&#x27;s piece &quot;A Lousy Journey of Love&quot; is part of &quot;Blown Blossom and Fallen Leaves&quot;, an anthology of his work compiled and published posthumously by his friend and trainee, Ōta Nanpo. Within this piece, the reader follows the journey of two lice traversing the body of a boy. Gennai employs frequent wordplay and puns, which add to the absurdity and humor of telling a story from the perspective of a louse.

==Appearances in fiction==
*Hiraga Gennai (1989, TBS, as Gennai: Toshiyuki Nishida)
In the film, Gennai is the protagonist of a detective-like role who uses his wealth of knowledge to solve the mystery of the incident that occurred in Edo.
*Gennai appears as a scholar/inventor and cross-dressing lesbian in the manga &quot;Ōoku: The Inner Chambers&quot; (2005–2020) by Fumi Yoshinaga.

*In the Square game &quot;Live-A-Live&quot;, there is a mechanic named Gennai who is responsible for the creation of mechanical traps in the Bakumatsu Chapter. Since the setting of the chapter is the Bakumatsu era, his presence is an anachronism, but considering the additional presence of Ishikawa Goemon, Yodo-Dono, and Shiro Tokisada Amakusa, it is clear that this section of the game was intentionally designed as a mash-up of popular Japanese history.

He reappears in the second season called &quot;Digimon Adventure 02&quot; as a younger man.

<doc id="313275" wikidata="Q889408" url="?curid=313275" title="Boeing C-40 Clipper">
<text>The Boeing C-40 Clipper is a military version of the Boeing 737 Next Generation used to transport cargo and passengers. It is used by the United States Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The Navy C-40A variant is named &quot;Clipper&quot;, whereas the USAF C-40B/C variants are officially unnamed.

==Design and development==
The C-40 combines the Boeing 737-700 fuselage with the strengthened wings and landing gear of the larger and heavier 737-800. It also has auxiliary fuel tanks allowing an unrefueled range of up to compared with for the standard 737-700.

===C-40A===
First flight took place in April 2000 and the first of the C-40A aircraft entered service in April 2001.

The U.S. Navy Reserve was the first customer for a 737 Next Generation based &quot;combi&quot; aircraft (capable of transporting cargo and passengers). The Clipper was ordered by the U.S. Navy to replace its fleet of aging C-9B Skytrain IIs. The C-40A is the first new logistics aircraft in 17 years to join the U.S. Navy Reserve. The Navy Reserve provides all of the Navy&#x27;s medium and heavy airlift capabilities. The Clipper meets or exceeds international noise and environmental requirements, which the fleet of Naval Reserve C-9s did not. It is also more fuel-efficient and offers increased range and payload capabilities. The Clipper is certified to operate in an all-passenger (121 passengers), all-cargo or combination (&quot;combi&quot;) configuration that can accommodate up to three cargo pallets and 70 passengers on the main deck.

The Navy purchased the airplanes using standard commercial practices, ordering six of the 737-700C models. The first two of four aircraft were delivered on 21 April 2001 to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Five Nine (VR-59) at the Naval Air Station/Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas, with two more aircraft following before the end of the year. The fifth and sixth aircraft were delivered in August 2002 to VR-58 at the Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. Further aircraft have been delivered to VR-57 at the Naval Air Station North Island, California. The C-40A provides superior fuel efficiency, range and payload compared to the C-9B aircraft it replaced.

In the 2018 Marine Aviation Plan, the U.S. Marine Corps indicated that it intended to acquire two C-40A aircraft for airlift missions, replacing its Skytrain fleet. On 4 December 2018 an online notice was posted by the Marines seeking a supplier of C-40s to be delivered in 2020. The USMC Skytrains were retired in 2017 and to prepare for the transition to new aircraft, personnel from Marine Transport Squadron One were assigned to operate Navy Clippers until the arrival of their own aircraft.

===C-40B===
The United States Air Force selected the C-40B, a military version of the 737-700 Boeing Business Jet, to replace the aging fleet of C-137 aircraft used to transport U.S. combatant commanders. The Air Force awarded the medium lift contract in August 2000. The 89th Airlift Wing acquired its first C-40B aircraft in December 2002. Both units are based at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. The 15th Airlift Wing, Hickam AFB, Hawaii, acquired its C-40B for U.S. Pacific Command in February 2003. The 86th Airlift Wing, Ramstein AB, Germany, acquired its C-40B for U.S. Air Forces in Europe in December 2004.

The cabin area is equipped with a crew rest area, distinguished visitor compartment with sleep accommodations, two galleys and business class seating with worktables.

The C-40B is designed to be an &quot;office in the sky&quot; for senior military and government leaders. The aircraft features two-way broadband data communications, including secure voice and data communication; elements include internet and network access, telephones, satellites, facsimile and copy machines. The C-40B also has a computer-based passenger data system.

===C-40C===

The C-40C is a VIP transport aircraft often used to carry members of the Cabinet and Congress, and is intending to replace the Boeing C-22. The aircraft is equipped similarly to the C-40B, but without the advanced communications capabilities. Unique to the C-40C is the capability to change its configuration to accommodate from 42 to 111 passengers. The C-40C replaced three C-22s (a militarized Boeing 727) operated by the Air National Guard and National Guard Bureau to airlift personnel. The C-40C was the first military aircraft to be acquired in this as an off-the-shelf aircraft for the Department of Defense. The 201st Airlift Squadron, District of Columbia Air National Guard acquired two C-40C aircraft in October 2002. The Air Force Reserve 932d Airlift Wing, Scott AFB, Illinois acquired three C-40C aircraft in 2007.

<doc id="313277" wikidata="Q4791789" url="?curid=313277" title="Arkansas Gazette">
<text>The Arkansas Gazette was a newspaper in Little Rock, Arkansas, that was published from 1819 to 1991. It was known as the oldest newspaper west of the Mississippi River. It was located from 1908 until its closing at the now historic Gazette Building. For many years it was the newspaper of record for Little Rock and the State of Arkansas. It was Arkansas&#x27; first newspaper.

==History==
The &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; began publication at Arkansas Post, the first capital of Arkansas Territory, on November 20, 1819. The &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; was established seventeen years before Arkansas became a state. When the capital was moved to Little Rock in 1821, publisher William E. Woodruff also relocated the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot;. The newspaper was the first to report Arkansas&#x27; statehood in 1836.
Over the decades the paper was bought and sold many times. During the Civil War the paper shut down from September 1863 to May 1865. After the war the Gazette became the first newspaper to have telegraphic services from which they began to receive news from places like New Orleans, Louisiana, Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri. In 1870 the paper editorialized that, &quot;Although we have been most shamefully and outrageously wronged, cheated, and defrauded out of our just and lawful rights, by a most notoriously partial and partisan execution of the registration and election laws, we have succeeded in electing a respectable minority to the legislature, who will act as a Spartan guard at the Thermopylae of our menaced rights and liberties, and beat back the invading tide of radicalism that threatens to overwhelm us with ruin.&quot;

In 1908 the &quot;Gazette&quot; added colored comics. After the Elaine massacre of 1919, state officials concocted an elaborate cover-up, claiming that blacks were planning an insurrection. Newspapers, including the Arkansas Gazette, repeated the falsehood that blacks in Arkansas were staging an insurrection: the Gazette wrote that Elaine was &quot;a zone of negro insurrection.&quot; Subsequent to this reporting, more than 100 African Americans were indicted, with 12 being sentenced to death by electrocution. After a years-long legal battle by the NAACP, the 12 men were acquitted.

During the Little Rock Nine Crisis the &quot;Gazette&quot; promoted the integration of schools which lost them millions of dollars. But in the aftermath the &quot;Gazette&quot; regained its status. In 1958, the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service and Harry Ashmore of the &quot;Gazette&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing for their coverage of the school integration crisis in Little Rock. 

Through much of its history, the &quot;Gazette&quot; was in competition with the &quot;Arkansas Democrat&quot;. Competition became more intense in 1979 when the &quot;Democrat&quot; changed from publishing in the evening to publishing in the morning. After 12 years of bitter competition in the morning, the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; published its final edition on October 18, 1991. The assets of the newspaper were sold to Walter E. Hussman Jr., owner and publisher of the competing &quot;Arkansas Democrat&quot;. Hussman renamed the surviving paper the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.&quot; The surviving newspaper proclaims itself a descendant of the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot;, but this viewpoint is disputed by the 726 full-time and 1,200 part-time employees of the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; who lost their jobs with the demise of their newspaper, as well as by readers of the &quot;Gazette&quot; who preferred the quality of journalism found in the &quot;Gazette&quot; to that found in the &quot;Arkansas Democrat,&quot; even holding a vigil for its demise.

<doc id="313283" wikidata="Q355447" url="?curid=313283" title="Fukuzawa Yukichi">
<text>was a Japanese educator, philosopher, writer, entrepreneur and samurai who founded Keio Gijuku, the newspaper &quot;&quot;, and the Institute for Study of Infectious Diseases. 

Fukuzawa was an early advocate for reform in Japan. His ideas about the organization of government and the structure of social institutions made a lasting impression on a rapidly changing Japan during the Meiji period. He appears on the 10,000-Japanese yen banknote from 1984 to 2024, replacing Prince Shotoku.

== Early life ==

Fukuzawa Yukichi was born into an impoverished low-ranking samurai (military nobility) family of the Okudaira Clan of Nakatsu Domain (present-day Ōita, Kyushu) in 1835. His family lived in Osaka, the main trading center for Japan at the time. His family was poor following the early death of his father, who was also a Confucian scholar. At the age of 5 he started Han learning, and by the time he turned 14, he had studied major writings such as the &quot;Analects&quot;, &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. Fukuzawa was greatly influenced by his lifelong teacher, Shōzan Shiraishi, who was a scholar of Confucianism and Han learning. Yukichi turned 19 in 1854, shortly after the Perry Expedition&#x27;s arrival in Japan marking the beginning of the opening of Japan to trade via Gunboat diplomacy. As the family patriarch Fukuzawa&#x27;s brother asked him to travel to Nagasaki, where the Dutch colony at Dejima was located, in order to enter a school of Dutch studies &quot;(rangaku).&quot; He instructed Yukichi to learn Dutch so that he might study European cannon designs and gunnery.

Fukuzawa’s early life consisted of the dull and backbreaking work typical of a lower-level samurai in Japan during the Edo period. Although Fukuzawa did travel to Nagasaki, his stay was brief as he quickly began to outshine his host in Nagasaki, Okudaira Iki. Okudaira planned to get rid of Fukuzawa by writing a letter saying that Fukuzawa&#x27;s mother was ill. Seeing through the fake letter, Fukuzawa planned to travel to Edo and continue his studies there, since he would be unable to do so in his home domain of Nakatsu. However, upon his return to Osaka, his brother persuaded him to stay and enroll at the Tekijuku school run by physician and &quot;rangaku&quot; scholar Ogata Kōan. Fukuzawa studied at Tekijuku for three years and became fully proficient in the Dutch language. In 1858, he was appointed the official Dutch teacher of Nakatsu, and was sent to Edo to teach the family&#x27;s vassals there.

The following year, Japan opened up three of its ports to American and European ships, and Fukuzawa, intrigued with Western civilization, traveled to Kanagawa to see them. When he arrived, he discovered that virtually all of the European merchants there were speaking English rather than Dutch. He then began to study English, but at that time, English-Japanese interpreters were rare and dictionaries nonexistent, so his studies were slow.

In 1859, the Tokugawa shogunate sent their first diplomatic mission to the United States. Fukuzawa volunteered his services to Admiral Kimura Yoshitake. Kimura&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;, arrived in San Francisco, California, in 1860. The delegation stayed in the city for a month, during which time Fukuzawa had himself photographed with an American girl, and also found a &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, from which he began serious study of the English language.

== Political movements ==
Upon his return in 1860, Fukuzawa became an official translator for the Tokugawa shogunate. Shortly afterwards he brought out his first publication, an English-Japanese dictionary which he called &quot;Kaei Tsūgo&quot; (translated from a Chinese-English dictionary) which was a beginning for his series of later books. In 1862, he visited Europe as one of the two English translators in the First Japanese Embassy to Europe. During its year in Europe, the Embassy conducted negotiations with France, England, the Netherlands, Prussia, and finally Russia. In Russia, the embassy attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate for the southern end of Sakhalin (in Japanese Karafuto), a long-standing source of dispute between the two countries.

The information collected during these travels resulted in his famous work &quot;&quot; (, ), which he published in ten volumes in 1867, 1868 and 1870. The books describe western culture and institutions in simple, easy to understand terms, and they became immediate best-sellers. Fukuzawa was soon regarded as the foremost expert on western civilization, leading him to conclude that his mission in life was to educate his countrymen in new ways of thinking in order to enable Japan to resist European imperialism.

In 1868 he changed the name of the school he had established to teach Dutch to Keio Gijuku, and from then on devoted all his time to education. He also added public speaking to the educational system&#x27;s curriculum. While Keiō&#x27;s initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies (Keio-gijuku), it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890. Under the name Keio-Gijuku University, it became a leader in Japanese higher education.

Fukuzawa was also a strong advocate for women’s rights. He often spoke up in favor of equality between husbands and wives, the education of girls as well as boys, and the equal love of daughters and sons. At the same time, he called attention to harmful practices such as women’s inability to own property in their own name and the familial distress that took place when married men took mistresses. However, even Fukuzawa was not willing to propose completely equal rights for men and women; only for husbands and wives. He also stated in his 1899 book &quot;New Greater Learning for Women&quot; that a good marriage was always the best outcome for a young woman, and according to some of Fukuzawa&#x27;s personal letters, he discouraged his friends from sending their daughters on to higher education so that they would not become less desirable marriage candidates. While some of Yukichi’s other proposed reforms, such as education reforms, found an eager audience, his ideas about women received a less enthusiastic reception.

== Death ==
After suffering a stroke on January 25, 1901, Fukuzawa Yukichi died on February 3. He was buried at Zenpuku-ji, in the Azabu area of Tokyo. Alumni of Keio-Gijuku University hold a ceremony there every year on February 3.

== Works ==
Fukuzawa&#x27;s writings may have been the foremost of the Edo period and Meiji period. They played a large role in the introduction of Western culture into Japan.

=== &quot;English-Japanese Dictionary&quot; ===
In 1860, he published &quot;English-Japanese Dictionary&quot; (&quot;Zōtei Kaei Tsūgo&quot;). It was his first publication. He bought &quot;English-Chinese Dictionary&quot; (&quot;Kaei Tsūgo&quot;) in San Francisco in 1860. He translated it to Japanese and he added the Japanese translations to the original textbook. In his book, he invented the new Japanese characters VU () to represent the pronunciation of VU, and VA () to represent the pronunciation of VA. For example, the name Beethoven is written as in modern Japanese.

=== &quot;All the Countries of the World, for Children Written in Verse&quot; ===
His famous textbook &quot;Sekai Kunizukushi&quot; (&quot;All the Countries of the World, for Children Written in Verse&quot;, 1869) became a best seller and was used as an official school textbook. His inspiration for writing the books came when he tried to teach world geography to his sons. At the time there were no textbooks on the subject, so he decided to write one himself. He started by buying a few Japanese geography books for children, named &quot;Miyakoji&quot; (&quot;City roads&quot;) and &quot;Edo hōgaku&quot; (&quot;Tokyo maps&quot;), and practiced reading them aloud. He then wrote &quot;Sekai Kunizukushi&quot; in six volumes in the same lyrical style. The first volume covered Asia, the second Africa, the third Europe, the fourth South America, and the fifth both North America and Australia. The sixth volume was an appendix that gave an introduction to world geography.

=== &quot;An Encouragement of Learning&quot; ===
Influenced by the 1835 and 1856 editions of &quot;Elements of Moral Science&quot; by Brown University President Francis Wayland, from 1872-76 Fukuzawa published 17 volumes of &quot;Gakumon no Susume&quot; (, or more idiomatically &quot;On Studying&quot;). Through these writings, Fukuzawa develops his views on the importance of equality of opportunity as a principle, explores his understanding of the principle, and stresses that education is the key to taking best advantage of 
the principle and achieving greatness. For these reasons, he was an avid supporter of public schools and believed in a firm mental foundation through learning and studiousness. Fukuzawa also advocated in these writings his most lasting motto, &quot;national independence through personal independence.&quot; By creating a self-determining social morality for a Japan still reeling from both the political upheavals wrought by the unwanted end to its isolationism and the cultural upheavals caused by the inundation of so much novelty in products, methods, and ideas, Fukuzawa hoped to instill a sense of personal strength among the people of Japan so they could build a nation to rival all others. To his understanding, Western nations had become more powerful than other regions because their societies fostered education, individualism (independence), competition and exchange of ideas.

=== &quot;An Outline of a Theory of Civilization&quot; ===
Fukuzawa published many influential essays and critical works. A particularly prominent example is &quot;Bunmeiron no Gairyaku&quot; (, ) published in 1875, in which he details his own theory of civilization. It was influenced by &quot;Histoire de la civilisation en Europe&quot; (1828; Eng. trans in 1846) by François Guizot and &quot;History of Civilization in England&quot; (1872–1873, 2nd London ed.) by Henry Thomas Buckle. According to Fukuzawa, civilization is relative to time and circumstance, as well in comparison. For example, at the time China was relatively civilized in comparison to some African colonies, and European nations were the most civilized of all.

Colleagues in the Meirokusha intellectual society shared many of Fukuzawa&#x27;s views, which he published in his contributions to &quot;Meiroku zasshi&quot; (Meiji Six Magazine), a scholarly journal he helped publish. In his books and journals, he often wrote about the word &quot;civilization&quot; and what it meant. He advocated a move toward &quot;civilization&quot;, by which he meant material and spiritual well-being, which elevated human life to a &quot;higher plane&quot;. Because material and spiritual well-being corresponded to knowledge and &quot;virtue&quot;, to &quot;move toward civilization&quot; was to advance and pursue knowledge and virtue themselves. He contended that people could find the answer to their life or their present situation from &quot;civilization.&quot; Furthermore, the difference between the weak and the powerful and large and small was just a matter of difference between their knowledge and education.

He argued that Japan should not import guns and materials. Instead it should support the acquisition of knowledge, which would eventually take care of the material necessities. He talked of the Japanese concept of being practical or pragmatic (, &quot;jitsugaku&quot;) and the building of things that are basic and useful to other people. In short, to Fukuzawa, &quot;civilization&quot; essentially meant the furthering of knowledge and education.

== Legacy ==

Fukuzawa&#x27;s most important contribution to the reformation effort, though, came in the form of a newspaper called (, &quot;Current Events&quot;), which he started in 1882, after being prompted by Inoue Kaoru, Ōkuma Shigenobu, and Itō Hirobumi to establish a strong influence among the people, and in particular to transmit to the public the government&#x27;s views on the projected national assembly, and as reforms began, Fukuzawa, whose fame was already unquestionable, began production of &quot;Jiji Shinpo&quot;, which received wide circulation, encouraging the people to enlighten themselves and to adopt a moderate political attitude towards the change that was being engineered within the social and political structures of Japan. He translated many books and journals into Japanese on a wide variety of subjects, including chemistry, the arts, military and society, and published many books (in multiple volumes) and journals himself describing Western society, his own philosophy and change, etc.
Fukuzawa was one of the most influential people ever that helped Japan modernize into the country it is today. He never accepted any high position and remained a normal Japanese citizen for his whole life. By the time of his death, he was revered as one of the founders of modern Japan. All of his work was written and was released at a critical juncture in the Japanese society and uncertainty for the Japanese people about their future after the signing of the Unequal treaties, their realization in the weakness of the Japanese government at the time (Tokugawa Shogunate) and its inability to repel the American and European influence. It should also be noted that there were bands of samurai that forcefully opposed the Americans and Europeans and their friends through murder and destruction. Fukuzawa was in danger of his life as a samurai group killed one of his colleagues for advocating policies like those of Fukuzawa. Fukuzawa wrote at a time when the Japanese people were undecided on whether they should be bitter about the American and European forced treaties and imperialism, or to understand the West and move forward. Fukuzawa greatly aided the ultimate success of the pro-modernization forces.

Fukuzawa appeared on the 10,000-yen banknote in the 1984 and 2004 issues, and has been compared to Benjamin Franklin in the United States. Franklin appears on the similarly-valued $100 bill. Although all other figures appearing on Japanese banknotes changed when the 2004 series was released, Fukuzawa remained on the 10,000-yen note. His image was eventually replaced by Shibusawa Eiichi in 2024.
Fukuzawa Yukichi was a firm believer that Western education surpassed Japan&#x27;s. However, he did not like the idea of parliamentary debates. As early as 1860, Fukuzawa Yukichi traveled to Europe and the United States. He believed that the problem in Japan was the undervalued mathematics and science. Also, these suffered from a &quot;lack of the idea of independence&quot;. The Japanese conservatives were not happy about Fukuzawa&#x27;s view of Western education. Since he was a family friend of conservatives, he took their stand to heart. Fukuzawa later came to state that he went a little too far.

One word sums up his entire theme and that is &quot;independence&quot;. Fukuzawa Yukichi believed that national independence was the framework to society in the West. However, to achieve this independence, as well as personal independence, Fukuzawa advocated Western learning. He believed that public virtue would increase as people became more educated.

===Former Residence of Fukuzawa Yukichi===

Fukuzawa Yukichi&#x27;s childhood home in the Rusui-cho neighbourhood of the city of Nakatsu in Ōita Prefecture still exists. It is located on the lower reaches of the Nakatsu River, almost due east of Nakatsu Castle (). Fukuzawa Yukichi was born in 1835 in the Nakatsu Domain warehouse in Osaka and the family returned to Nakatsu after his father&#x27;s death when he was 18 months old. He lived in this house in Nakatsu until age 19. The structure is a typical samurai residence of the late Edo Period and is a one-story wooden, thatch roof building with two 6-&quot;tatami&quot;, one 8-&quot;tatami&quot;, and one 4.5 &quot;tatami&quot; rooms. The north of the main building is a two-story &quot;kura&quot; storehouse with a tile roof. In 1971 this former residence and the ruins of a former residence across the street were designated as a National Historic Site. The house and the adjacent Fukuzawa Yukichi Memorial Hall, which displays the original manuscript of &quot;Gakaku no Susume&quot; and Fukuzawa Yukichi&#x27;s personal belongings, are the major tourist attractions of this city. It is located approximately a 15-minute walk from Nakatsu Station on the JR Kyushu Nippō Main Line.

<text>Winslow Homer (February 24, 1836 – September 29, 1910) was an American landscape painter and illustrator, best known for his marine subjects. He is considered one of the foremost painters of 19th-century America and a preeminent figure in American art in general.

Largely self-taught, Homer began his career working as a commercial illustrator. He subsequently took up oil painting and produced major studio works characterized by the weight and density he exploited from the medium. He also worked extensively in watercolor, creating a fluid and prolific oeuvre, primarily chronicling his working vacations.

==Early life==

Homer was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on February 24, 1836, the second of three sons of Charles Savage Homer and Henrietta Maria Benson Homer, both from long lines of New Englanders. His mother was a gifted amateur watercolorist and Homer&#x27;s first teacher. She and her son had a close relationship throughout their lives. Homer took on many of her traits, including her quiet, strong-willed, terse, sociable nature, her dry sense of humor, and her artistic talent. Homer had a happy childhood, growing up mostly in then-rural Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was an average student, but his art talent was evident in his early years.

Homer&#x27;s father was a volatile, restless businessman who was always looking to &quot;make a killing.&quot; When Homer was 13 years old, Charles gave up the hardware store business to seek a fortune in the California gold rush. When that failed, Charles left his family and went to Europe to raise capital for other get-rich-quick schemes that did not pay off.

After Homer&#x27;s high school graduation, his father saw a newspaper advertisement and arranged for an apprenticeship. Homer&#x27;s apprenticeship at the age of 19 to J. H. Bufford, a Boston commercial lithographer, was a formative but &quot;treadmill experience&quot;. He worked repetitively on sheet music covers and other commercial work for two years. By 1857, his freelance career was underway after he turned down an offer to join the staff of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. &quot;From the time I took my nose off that lithographic stone,&quot; Homer later stated, &quot;I have had no master, and never shall have any.&quot; Homer opened his own studio in Boston.

Homer&#x27;s career as an illustrator lasted nearly twenty years. He contributed illustrations of Boston life and rural New England life to magazines such as &quot;Ballou&#x27;s Pictorial&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; at a time when the market for illustrations was growing rapidly and fads and fashions were changing quickly. His early works, mostly commercial wood engravings of urban and country social scenes, are characterized by clean outlines, simplified forms, dramatic contrast of light and dark, and lively figure groupings—qualities that remained important throughout his career. His quick success was mostly due to this strong understanding of graphic design and also to the adaptability of his designs to wood engraving.

Before moving to New York City in 1859, Homer lived in Belmont, Massachusetts, with his family. His uncle&#x27;s Belmont mansion, the 1853 Homer House, was the inspiration for a number of his early illustrations and paintings, including several of his 1860s croquet pictures. The Homer House, owned by the Belmont Woman&#x27;s Club, is open for public tours.

==Homer&#x27;s studio==


In 1859, he opened a studio in the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City, the artistic and publishing capital of the United States. Until 1863, he attended classes at the National Academy of Design, and studied briefly with Frédéric Rondel, who taught him the basics of painting. In only about a year of self-training, Homer was producing excellent oil work. His mother tried to raise family funds to send him to Europe for further study but instead &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; sent Homer to the front lines of the American Civil War (1861–1865), where he sketched battle scenes and camp life, the quiet moments as well as the chaotic ones. His initial sketches were of the camp, commanders, and army of the famous Union officer, Major General George B. McClellan, at the banks of the Potomac River in October 1861.

Although the drawings did not get much attention at the time, they mark Homer&#x27;s expanding skills from illustrator to painter. As with his urban scenes, Homer illustrated women during wartime, and showed the effects of the war on the home front. The war work was dangerous and exhausting. Back at his studio, Homer would regain his strength and re-focus his artistic vision. He set to work on a series of war-related paintings based on his sketches, among them &quot;Sharpshooter on Picket Duty&quot; (1862), &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; (1863), and &quot;Prisoners from the Front&quot; (1866). He exhibited paintings of these subjects every year at the National Academy of Design from 1863 to 1866. &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; was shown at the National Academy to particular critical acclaim; it was quickly sold and the artist was consequently elected an Associate Academician, then a full Academician in 1865. During this time, he also continued to sell his illustrations to periodicals such as &quot;Our Young Folks&quot; and &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Chimney Corner&quot;.

After the American Civil War, Homer turned his attention primarily to scenes of childhood and young women, reflecting nostalgia for simpler times, both his own and the nation as a whole.

Homer was also interested in postwar subject matter that conveyed the silent tension between two communities seeking to understand their future. His oil painting &quot;A Visit from the Old Mistress&quot; (1876) shows an encounter between a group of four freed slaves and their former mistress. The formal equivalence between the standing figures suggests the balance that the nation hoped to find in the difficult years of Reconstruction. Homer composed this painting from sketches he had made while traveling through Virginia.

Near the beginning of his painting career, the 27-year-old Homer demonstrated a maturity of feeling, depth of perception, and mastery of technique which was immediately recognized. His realism was objective, true to nature, and emotionally controlled. One critic wrote, &quot;Winslow Homer is one of those few young artists who make a decided impression of their power with their very first contributions to the Academy ... He at this moment wields a better pencil, models better, colors better, than many whom, were it not improper, we could mention as regular contributors to the Academy.&quot; And of &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; specifically, &quot;There is no clap-trap about it. The delicacy and strength of emotion which reign throughout this little picture are not surpassed in the whole exhibition.&quot; &quot;It is a work of real feeling, soldiers in camp listening to the evening band, and thinking of the wives and darlings far away. There is no strained effect in it, no sentimentality, but a hearty, homely actuality, broadly, freely, and simply worked out.&quot;

==Early landscapes and watercolors==
Before exhibiting at the National Academy of Design, Homer finally traveled to Paris, France, in 1867 where he remained for a year. His most praised early painting,
&quot;Prisoners from the Front&quot;, was on exhibit at the in Paris at the same time. He did not study formally but he practiced landscape painting while continuing to work for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, depicting scenes of Parisian life.

Homer painted approximately one dozen small paintings during the stay. Although he arrived in France at a time of new fashions in art, Homer&#x27;s main subject for his paintings was peasant life, showing more of an alignment with the established French Barbizon school and the artist Millet than with newer artists Manet and Courbet. Though his interest in depicting natural light parallels that of the early impressionists, there is no evidence of direct influence as he was already a plein-air painter in America and had already evolved a personal style which was much closer to Manet than Monet. Homer was very private about his personal life and his methods (even denying his first biographer any personal information or commentary), but his stance was clearly one of independence of style and a devotion to American subjects. As his fellow artist Eugene Benson wrote, Homer believed that artists &quot;should never look at pictures&quot; but should &quot;stutter in a language of their own.&quot;

Throughout the 1870s, Homer continued painting mostly rural or idyllic scenes of farm life, children playing, and young adults courting, including &quot;Country School&quot; (1871) and &quot;The Morning Bell&quot; (1872). In 1875, Homer quit working as a commercial illustrator and vowed to survive on his paintings and watercolors alone. Despite his excellent critical reputation, his finances continued to remain precarious. His popular 1872 painting &quot;Snap the Whip&quot; was exhibited at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as was one of his finest and most famous paintings, &quot;Breezing Up&quot; (1876). Of his work at this time, Henry James wrote:

We frankly confess that we detest his subjects ... he has chosen the least pictorial range of scenery and civilization; he has resolutely treated them as if they &quot;were&quot; pictorial ... and, to reward his audacity, he has incontestably succeeded.

Many disagreed with James. &quot;Breezing Up&quot;, Homer&#x27;s iconic painting of a father and three boys out for a spirited sail, received wide praise. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;There is no picture in this exhibition, nor can we remember when there has been a picture in any exhibition, that can be named alongside this.&quot; Visits to Petersburg, Virginia, around 1876 resulted in paintings of rural African American life. The same straightforward sensibility which allowed Homer to distill art from these potentially sentimental subjects also yielded the most unaffected views of African American life at the time, as illustrated in &quot;Dressing for the Carnival&quot; (1877) and &quot;A Visit from the Old Mistress&quot; (1876).

In 1877, Homer exhibited for the first time at the Boston Art Club with the oil painting, &quot;An Afternoon Sun&quot;, (owned by the Artist). From 1877 through 1909, Homer exhibited often at the Boston Art Club. Works on paper, both drawings and watercolors, were frequently exhibited by Homer beginning in 1882. A most unusual sculpture by the Artist, &quot;Hunter with Dog – Northwoods&quot;, was exhibited in 1902. By that year, Homer had switched his primary Gallery from the Boston-based Doll and Richards to the New York City based Knoedler &amp; Co.

Homer became a member of The Tile Club, a group of artists and writers who met frequently to exchange ideas and organize outings for painting, as well as foster the creation of decorative tiles. For a short time, he designed tiles for fireplaces.

Homer&#x27;s nickname in The Tile Club was &quot;The Obtuse Bard&quot;. Other well known Tilers were painters William Merritt Chase, Arthur Quartley, and the sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens.

Homer started painting with watercolors on a regular basis in 1873 during a summer stay in Gloucester, Massachusetts. From the beginning, his technique was natural, fluid and confident, demonstrating his innate talent for a difficult medium. His impact would be revolutionary. Here, again, the critics were puzzled at first, &quot;A child with an ink bottle could not have done worse.&quot; Another critic said that Homer &quot;made a sudden and desperate plunge into water color painting&quot;. But his watercolors proved popular and enduring, and sold more readily, improving his financial condition considerably. They varied from highly detailed (&quot;Blackboard&quot; – 1877) to broadly impressionistic (&quot;Schooner at Sunset&quot; – 1880). Some watercolors were made as preparatory sketches for oil paintings (as for &quot;Breezing Up&quot;) and some as finished works in themselves. Thereafter, he seldom traveled without paper, brushes and water based paints.

As a result of disappointments with women or from some other emotional turmoil, Homer became reclusive in the late 1870s, no longer enjoying urban social life and living instead in Gloucester. For a while, he even lived in secluded Eastern Point Lighthouse (with the keeper&#x27;s family). In re-establishing his love of the sea, Homer found a rich source of themes while closely observing the fishermen, the sea, and the marine weather. After 1880, he rarely featured genteel women at leisure, focusing instead on working women.

==Life in the United Kingdom==

Homer spent two years (1881–1882) in the coastal village of Cullercoats, Northumberland. Many of the paintings at Cullercoats took as their subjects working men and women and their daily heroism, imbued with a solidity and sobriety which was new to Homer&#x27;s art, presaging the direction of his future work. He wrote, &quot;The women are the working bees. Stout hardy creatures.&quot; His works from this period are almost exclusively watercolors. His palette became constrained and sober; his paintings larger, more ambitious, and more deliberately conceived and executed. His subjects more universal and less nationalistic, more heroic by virtue of his unsentimental rendering. Although he moved away from the spontaneity and bright innocence of the American paintings of the 1860s and 1870s, Homer found a new style and vision which carried his talent into new realms.

==Maine and maturity==

Back in the U.S. in November 1882, Homer showed his English watercolors in New York. Critics noticed the change in style at once, &quot;He is a very different Homer from the one we knew in days gone by&quot;, now his pictures &quot;touch a far higher plane ... They are works of High Art.&quot; Homer&#x27;s women were no longer &quot;dolls who flaunt their millinery&quot; but &quot;sturdy, fearless, fit wives and mothers of men&quot; who are fully capable of enduring the forces and vagaries of nature alongside their men.

In 1883, Homer moved to Prouts Neck, Maine (in Scarborough), and lived at his family&#x27;s estate in the remodeled carriage house seventy-five feet from the ocean. During the rest of the mid-1880s, Homer painted his monumental sea scenes. In &quot;Undertow&quot; (1886), depicting the dramatic rescue of two female bathers by two male lifeguards, Homer&#x27;s figures &quot;have the weight and authority of classical figures&quot;. In &quot;Eight Bells&quot; (1886), two sailors carefully take their bearings on deck, calmly appraising their position and by extension, their relationship with the sea; they are confident in their seamanship but respectful of the forces before them. Other notable paintings among these dramatic struggle-with-nature images are &quot;Banks Fisherman&quot;, &quot;The Gulf Stream&quot;, &quot;Rum Cay&quot;, &quot;Mending the Nets&quot;, and &quot;Searchlight on Harbor Entrance, Santiago de Cuba&quot;. Some of these he repeated as etchings.
At fifty years of age, Homer had become a &quot;Yankee Robinson Crusoe, cloistered on his art island&quot; and &quot;a hermit with a brush&quot;. These paintings established Homer, as the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; wrote, &quot;in a place by himself as the most original and one of the strongest of American painters.&quot; But despite his critical recognition, Homer&#x27;s work never achieved the popularity of traditional Salon pictures or of the flattering portraits by John Singer Sargent. Many of the sea pictures took years to sell and &quot;Undertow&quot; only earned him $400.

In these years, Homer received emotional sustenance primarily from his mother, brother Charles, and sister-in-law Martha (&quot;Mattie&quot;). After his mother&#x27;s death, Homer became a &quot;parent&quot; for his aging but domineering father and Mattie became his closest female intimate. In the winters of 1884–5, Homer ventured to warmer locations in Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas and did a series of watercolors as part of a commission for &quot;Century Magazine&quot;. He replaced the turbulent green storm-tossed sea of Prouts Neck with the sparkling blue skies of the Caribbean and the hardy New Englanders with Black natives, further expanding his watercolor technique, subject matter, and palette. During this trip he painted &quot;Children Under a Palm Tree&quot; for Edith Blake, the wife of Henry Arthur Blake, the then-governor of The Bahamas. His tropical stays inspired and refreshed him in much the same way as Paul Gauguin&#x27;s trips to Tahiti.

&quot;Children Under a Palm Tree&quot; was re-discovered on an episode of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in 2008, and was formally attributed to Homer on BBC&#x27;s television series &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot; by Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce. Ownership of the painting remains an on-going controversy.


&quot;A Garden in Nassau&quot; (1885) is one of the best examples of these watercolors. Once again, his freshness and originality were praised by critics but proved too advanced for the traditional art buyers and he &quot;looked in vain for profits&quot;. Homer lived frugally, however, and fortunately his affluent brother Charles provided financial help when needed.

Homer frequently visited Key West, Florida, between 1888 and 1903. Some of his best-known works, &quot;A Norther, Key West, The Gulf Stream, Taking on Wet Provisions,&quot; and &quot;Palms in the Storm&quot;, are said to have been produced there.

Homer found inspiration in summer trips to the North Woods Club, near the hamlet of Minerva, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains. It was on these fishing vacations that he experimented with the watercolor medium, producing works of the utmost vigor and subtlety, hymns to solitude, nature, and to outdoor life. Homer does not shrink from the savagery of blood sports nor the struggle for survival. The color effects are boldly and facilely applied. In terms of quality and invention, Homer&#x27;s achievements as a watercolorist are unparalleled: &quot;Homer had used his singular vision and manner of painting to create a body of work that has not been matched.&quot;

In 1893, Homer painted one of his most famous &quot;Darwinian&quot; works, &quot;The Fox Hunt&quot;, which depicts a flock of starving crows descending on a fox slowed by deep snow. This was Homer&#x27;s largest painting, and it was immediately purchased by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, his first painting in a major American museum collection. In &quot;Huntsman and Dogs&quot; (1891), a lone, impassive hunter, with his yelping dogs at his side, heads home after a hunt with deer skins slung over his right shoulder. Another late work, &quot;The Gulf Stream&quot; (1899), shows a black sailor adrift in a damaged boat, surrounded by sharks as a waterspout approaches.

By 1900, Homer finally reached financial stability, as his paintings fetched good prices from museums and he began to receive rents from real estate properties. He also became free of the responsibilities of caring for his father, who had died two years earlier. Homer continued producing excellent watercolors, mostly on trips to Canada and the Caribbean. Other late works include sporting scenes such as &quot;Right and Left&quot;, as well as seascapes absent of human figures, mostly of waves crashing against rocks in varying light. His late seascapes are especially valued for their dramatic and forceful expression of nature&#x27;s powers, and for their beauty and intensity.

In his last decade, he at times followed the advice he had given a student artist in 1907: &quot;Leave rocks for your old age—they&#x27;re easy.&quot;

Homer died in 1910 at the age of 74 in his Prouts Neck studio and was interred in the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His painting, &quot;Shooting the Rapids, Saguenay River&quot;, remains unfinished.

His Prouts Neck studio, a National Historic Landmark, is now owned by the Portland Museum of Art, which offers tours.

==Influence==

Homer never taught in a school or privately, as did Thomas Eakins, but his works strongly influenced succeeding generations of American painters for their direct and energetic interpretation of man&#x27;s stoic relationship to an often neutral and sometimes harsh wilderness. Robert Henri called Homer&#x27;s work an &quot;integrity of nature&quot;.

American illustrator and teacher Howard Pyle revered Homer and encouraged his students to study him. His student and fellow illustrator, N. C. Wyeth (and through him Andrew Wyeth and Jamie Wyeth), shared the influence and appreciation, even following Homer to Maine for inspiration. The elder Wyeth&#x27;s respect for his antecedent was &quot;intense and absolute&quot; and can be observed in his early work &quot;Mowing&quot; (1907). Perhaps Homer&#x27;s austere individualism is best captured in his admonition to artists: &quot;Look at nature, work independently, and solve your own problems.&quot;

==U.S. stamp==
In 1962, the U.S. Post Office released a commemorative stamp honoring Winslow Homer. Homer&#x27;s famous oil painting &quot;Breezing Up&quot;, now hanging in the National Gallery in Washington DC, was chosen as the image for the design of this issue. On August 12, 2010, The Postal Service issued a 44-cent commemorative stamp featuring Homer&#x27;s &quot;Boys in a Pasture&quot; at the APS Stamp Show in Richmond, Virginia.

This stamp was the ninth to be issued in a series entitled &quot;American Treasures&quot;. The original painting is part of the Hayden Collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It depicts two boys from Belmont, Massachusetts—John Carney and Patrick Keenan—who posed for the artist for 75 cents per day.

==Works==
His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Unlike many artists who were well known for working in only one art medium, Winslow Homer was prominent in a variety of art media, as in the following examples:

Pastoral landscapes and lifestyle (see pastoralism) is a genre of literature, art and music that depicts shepherds herding livestock around open areas of land according to seasons and the changing availability of water and pasturage. A &quot;pastoral&quot; is a work of this genre.

Winslow Homer&#x27;s paintings often depicted marine landscapes. Later, when Winslow Homer spent the years between 1881 and 1882 in the village of Cullercoats, Tyne and Wear, his paintings depicting shores and coastal landscapes changed. Many of the paintings from the English coast have as subjects working men and women from the area.

<text>Gonnect is a strategy board game for two players invented by João Pedro Neto in 2000. The game is played with standard Go equipment (usually on a 13×13 or 15×15 board) and basically uses the same rules as &quot;Go&quot;, however the goal of the game is to construct a group that connects any two opposite sides. 

Seen from a superficial point of view, Gonnect belongs to the family of connection games with relatives &quot;Hex&quot; and &quot;Havannah&quot;; however, the game mutates into a game of territory (like Go) when played by advanced players.

==Game rules==
All the rules of &quot;Go&quot; apply, except that unlike &quot;Go&quot;, passing is not allowed. The winning condition is when a player connects opposite edges of the board (either top and bottom, or left and right) with a chain of stones in that player&#x27;s color. The pie rule is used to determine who moves first. A player loses if he has no legal move. In common with &quot;Go&quot;:
* A &quot;connection&quot; is formed between adjacent pieces of the same color that lie along one of the horizontal or vertical game board lines. Diagonally-adjacent pieces are not considered to be connected.
* A &quot;chain&quot; refers to a group of pieces of the same color such that all the pieces are connected through adjacent horizontal or vertical pieces.
* A stone has &quot;liberty&quot; when it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to an empty point. If any stone in a chain has liberty, the chain is considered to have liberty. When the chain has no liberty, it is considered to be captured and is removed from the board.
* Players are forbidden from playing a stone that creates a chain of that player&#x27;s color without liberties, unless that completes a capture and creates a liberty (suicide rule).
* Players are forbidden from making a move that would recreate the same board position as after their previous move (ko rule).

Games between skilled players often end up temporarily deadlocked, since the square Go board allows a &quot;four corners&quot; configuration where neither side can strongly connect; however, since players cannot pass, they eventually must start filling in the internal liberties of their groups. The player who has gained the smallest amount of territory usually loses, so building more territory than your opponent is a means of forcing a connection and winning.

Thus, a Gonnect game between similarly skilled-opponents generally unfolds in three stages:
# &quot;Board-filling&quot; stage – opponents race to connect sides until the position is deadlocked
# &quot;Eye-making&quot; stage – players squeeze their opponent&#x27;s territory to form safe groups with at least two eyes
# &quot;Eye-filling&quot; stage – players must fill in their own eye space or destroy their opponent&#x27;s

===Example===

In this example on a 13×13 board, Black has built a winning &quot;chain&quot; from A7-A8-A9 in the middle of the left side connecting to N2-N3 on the right side near the bottom corner. Because D10 and E9 are not considered adjacent because they are diagonal to each other, so there is no second winning Black &quot;chain&quot; from A9 to N11-12-13.

==History==
&quot;Gonnect&quot; was discovered on July 18, 2000 by Dr. João Neto, while he was updating his website &quot;Variations on Go&quot;. He was aiming to combine the play of &quot;Go&quot; with the connection objective of &quot;Hex&quot;, but was stymied by the deadlocks resulting from two-eye structures. In discussion with other game players, Neto realized that adding a &quot;no pass&quot; rule would resolve this. Rules have been published proposing the use of both 13×13 and 9×9 boards, although 9×9 and smaller boards give the first player (Black) a strong advantage.

<doc id="313295" wikidata="Q1136347" url="?curid=313295" title="Cauterization">
<text>Cauterization (or cauterisation, or cautery) is a medical practice or technique of burning a part of a body to remove or close off a part of it. It destroys some tissue in an attempt to mitigate bleeding and damage, remove an undesired growth, or minimize other potential medical harm, such as infections when antibiotics are unavailable.

The practice was once widespread for treatment of wounds. Its utility before the advent of antibiotics was said to be effective at more than one level:

*To prevent exsanguination
*To close amputations

Cautery was historically believed to prevent infection, but current research shows that cautery actually increases the risk for infection by causing more tissue damage and providing a more hospitable environment for bacterial growth. Actual cautery refers to the metal device, generally heated to a dull red glow, that a physician applies to produce blisters, to stop bleeding of a blood vessel, and for other similar purposes.

The main forms of cauterization used today are electrocautery and chemical cautery—both are, for example, prevalent in cosmetic removal of warts and stopping nosebleeds. Cautery can also mean the branding of a human.

==Etymology==
Cauterize is a Middle English word borrowed from the Old French , from Late Latin &quot;to burn or brand with a hot iron&quot;, from Ancient Greek (), from (), &quot;burning or branding iron&quot;, and (&quot;kaiein&quot;) &quot;to burn&quot; (of caustic).

==History==
Cauterization has been used to stop heavy bleeding since antiquity. The process was described in the Edwin Smith Papyrus and Hippocratic Corpus. It was primarily used to control hemorrhages, especially those resulting from surgery, in ancient Greece. Archigenes recommended cauterization in the event of hemorrhaging wounds, and Leonides of Alexandria described excising breast tumors and cauterizing the resulting wound in order to control bleeding. The Chinese recommends cauterization as a treatment for various ailments, including dog bites. Indigenous peoples of the Americas, ancient Arabs, and Persians also used the technique.

Tools used in the ancient cauterization process ranged from heated lances to cauterizing knives. The piece of metal was heated over fire and applied to the wound.

Cauterization continued to be used as a common treatment in medieval times. The Babylonian Talmud (redacted in 500 AD), alluding to the practice, states: &quot;... and the effect of the hot iron comes and removes the traces of the stroke.&quot; While mainly employed to stop blood loss, it was also used in cases of tooth extraction and as a treatment for mental illness. In the Muslim world, scholars Al-Zahrawi and Avicenna wrote about techniques and instruments used for cauterization.

As late as the 20th-century, Bedouins of the Negev in Palestine had it as their practice to take the root of the shaggy sparrow-wort (&quot;Thymelaea hirsuta&quot;), cut the root into splinters lengthwise, burn the splinter in fire, and then apply the red-hot tip of a splinter to the forehead of a person who was ill with ringworm (dermatophytosis).

The technique of ligature of the arteries as an alternative to cauterization was later improved and used more effectively by Ambroise Paré.

==Electrocautery==
Electrocauterization is the process of destroying tissue (or cutting through soft tissue) using heat conduction from a metal probe heated by electric current. The procedure stops bleeding from small vessels (larger vessels being ligated). Electrocautery applies high frequency alternating current by a &quot;unipolar&quot; or &quot;bipolar&quot; method. It can be a continuous waveform to cut tissue, or intermittent to coagulate tissue.

The electrically produced heat in this process inherently can do numerous things to the tissue, depending on the waveform and power level, including cauterize, coagulate, cut, and dry (desiccate). Thus electrocautery, electrocoagulation, electrodesiccation, and electrocurettage are closely related and can co-occur in the same procedure when desired. Electrodesiccation and curettage is a common procedure.

===Unipolar===
In unipolar cauterization, the physician contacts the tissue with a single small electrode. The circuit&#x27;s exit point is a large surface area, such as the buttocks, to prevent electrical burns. The amount of heat generated depends on the size of contact area, power setting or frequency of current, duration of application, and waveform. A constant waveform generates more heat than intermittent. The frequency used in cutting the tissue is higher than in coagulation mode.

===Bipolar===
Bipolar electrocautery passes the current between two tips of a forceps-like tool. It has the advantage of not disturbing other electrical body rhythms (such as the heart) and also coagulates tissue by pressure. Lateral thermal injury is greater in unipolar than bipolar devices.

Electrocauterization is preferable to chemical cauterization, because chemicals can leach into neighbouring tissue and cauterize outside of intended boundaries. Concern has also been raised regarding toxicity of the surgical smoke electrocautery produces. This contains chemicals that, through inhalation, may harm patients or medical staff.

Ultrasonic coagulation and ablation systems are also available.

==Chemical cautery==
Many chemical reactions can destroy tissue, and some are used routinely in medicine, most commonly to remove small skin lesions such as warts or necrotized tissue, or for hemostasis. Because chemicals can leach into areas not intended for cauterization, laser and electrical methods are preferable where practical. Some cauterizing agents are:

*Silver nitrate is the active ingredient of the lunar caustic, a stick that traditionally looks like a large match. It is dipped in water and pressed onto the lesion for a few moments.
*Trichloroacetic acid
*Cantharidin is an extract of the blister beetle that causes epidermal necrosis and blistering. It is used to treat warts.

==Nasal cauterization==
Frequent nosebleeds are most likely caused by an exposed blood vessel in the nose, usually one in Kiesselbach&#x27;s plexus.

Even if the nose is not bleeding at the time, a physician may cauterize it to prevent future bleeding. Cauterization methods include burning the affected area with acid, hot metal, or lasers. Such a procedure is naturally quite painful. Sometimes, a physician uses liquid nitrogen as a less painful alternative, though it is less effective. A physician may apply cocaine in the few countries that allow it for medical use. Cocaine is the only local anesthetic that also produces vasoconstriction, making it ideal for controlling nosebleeds.

More modern treatment applies silver nitrate after a local anesthetic. The procedure is generally painless, but after the anesthetic wears off, there may be pain for several days, and the nose may run for up to a week after this treatment.

Nasal cauterization can cause empty nose syndrome.

==Infant circumcision==
Cauterization has been used for the circumcision of infants in the United States and Canada. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba advises against its use in neonatal circumcision. This method of circumcision resulted in several infants having their penises severely burned.

<text>The Montessori method of education is a type of educational method that involves children&#x27;s natural interests and activities rather than formal teaching methods. A Montessori classroom places an emphasis on hands-on learning and developing real-world skills. It emphasizes independence and it views children as naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a sufficiently supportive and well-prepared learning environment. It also discourages some conventional methods of measuring achievement, such as grades and tests.

The method was started in the early 20th century by Italian physician Maria Montessori, who developed her theories through scientific experimentation with her students. The method has since been used in many parts of the world, in public and private schools.

A range of practices exists under the name &quot;Montessori&quot;, which is not trademarked. Popular elements include mixed-age classrooms, student freedom (including their choices of activity), long blocks of uninterrupted work time, specially trained teachers, and a prepared environment. Scientific studies regarding the Montessori method report generally favorable outcomes for students.

== History ==

Maria Montessori initially resisted a career in teaching, one of only a few professions open to women in that time period. She became one of the first women to become a medical doctor in Italy in the 19th century, and specialized in psychiatry and pediatrics. Maria Montessori began developing her educational philosophy and methods in 1897, attending courses in pedagogy at the University of Rome and learning educational theory. While visiting Rome&#x27;s mental asylums during her schooling with a teacher, Montessori observed that confined children were in need of more stimulation from their environment. In 1907, she opened her first classroom, the Casa dei Bambini, or Children&#x27;s House, in a tenement building in Rome. From the beginning, Montessori based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as &quot;scientific pedagogy.&quot;

In 1901, Maria Montessori met the prominent education reformers Alice and Leopoldo Franchetti. Maria Montessori was invited to hold her first course for teachers and to set up a &quot;Casa dei Bambini&quot; at Villa Montesca, the home of the Franchettis in Città di Castello. Montessori lived with the Franchettis for two years and refined her methodology together with Alice Franchetti. In 1909, she documented her theories in &quot;Il metodo della pedagogia scientifica&quot; (later translated into English as &quot;The Montessori Method&quot; in 1912).

Montessori education had spread to the United States by 1912 and became widely known in educational and popular publications. In 1913 Narcissa Cox Vanderlip and Frank A. Vanderlip founded the Scarborough School, the first Montessori school in the U.S. However, conflict arose between Montessori and the American educational establishment. The 1914 critical booklet &quot;The Montessori System Examined&quot; by influential education teacher William Heard Kilpatrick limited the spread of Montessori&#x27;s ideas, and they languished after 1914. Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12.

Montessori education also spread throughout the world, including Southeast Asia and India, where Maria Montessori was interned during World War II. In October 1931, Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi met with Maria Montessori in London. At the time, Gandhi was very interested in the role the Montessori method might play in helping to build an independent nation. Thus, initially, Montessori education in India was connected to the Indian independence movement. Later, elite, private Montessori schools also arose, and in the 1950s, some Montessori schools opened to serve children from lower-socioeconomic families, a trend that continues today with foundation and government-funded schools.

The Montessori method was adapted for Christian education by Sofia Cavaletti and Gianna Gobbi, in The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd. Their method was further adapted by Jerome Berryman, in Godly Play.

== Methods ==

Montessori education is based on a model of human development. This educational style operates abiding by two beliefs: that psychological self-construction in children and developing adults occurs through environmental interactions, and that children (especially under the age of six) have an innate path of psychological development. Based on her observations, Montessori believed that children who are at liberty to choose and act freely within an environment prepared according to her model would act spontaneously for optimal development.

Although a range of practices exists under the &quot;Montessori&quot; name, the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) and the American Montessori Society (AMS) cite these elements as essential:

* Mixed-age classrooms: classrooms for children ages or 3 to 6 years old are by far the most common, but 0–3, 3–6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–15, and 15–18-year-old classrooms exist as well
* Student choice of activity from within a prescribed range of optional choices
* Uninterrupted blocks of work time, ideally three hours long
* A constructivist or &quot;discovery&quot; model, in which students learn concepts from working with materials rather than by direct instruction
* Specialized educational materials are often made out of natural, aesthetic materials such as wood, rather than plastic
* A thoughtfully prepared environment where materials are organized by subject area, is accessible to children, and is appropriately sized
* Freedom, within limits
* A trained teacher experienced in observing a child&#x27;s characteristics, tendencies, innate talents, and abilities
* No external rewards, such as grades or stickers, are given to inspire children to learn material or behave well

Montessori education involves free activity within a &quot;prepared environment&quot;, meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child. The function of the environment is to help and allow the child to develop independence in all areas according to their inner psychological directives. In addition to offering access to the Montessori materials appropriate to the age of the children, the environment should exhibit the following characteristics:

== Education practices ==

=== Infant and toddler programs ===

Montessori classrooms for children under three fall into several categories, with a number of terms being used. A &quot;&quot;, Italian for &quot;nest&quot;, serves a small number of children from around two months to around 14 months, or when the child is confidently walking. A &quot;Young Child Community&quot; serves a larger number of children from around one year to or 3 years old. Both environments emphasize materials and activities scaled to the children&#x27;s size and abilities, opportunities to develop movement, and activities to develop independence. The development of independence in toileting is typically emphasized as well. Some schools also offer &quot;Parent-Infant&quot; classes, in which parents participate with their very young children.

=== Preschool and kindergarten ===

Montessori classrooms for children from or 3 to 6 years old are often called Children&#x27;s Houses, after Montessori&#x27;s first school, the Casa dei Bambini in Rome in 1906. A typical classroom serves 20 to 30 children in mixed-age groups, staffed by a fully trained lead teacher and assistants. Classrooms are usually outfitted with child-sized tables and chairs arranged singly or in small clusters, with classroom materials on child-height shelves throughout the room. Activities are for the most part initially presented by the teacher, after which they may be chosen more or less freely by the children as interest dictates. A teacher&#x27;s role within a Montessori classroom is to guide and consult students individually by letting each child create their own learning pathway. Classroom materials usually include activities for engaging in practical skills such as pouring and spooning, washing up, scrubbing tables and sweeping. Also materials for the development of the senses, mathematical materials, language materials, music, art and cultural materials, including more science-based activities like &#x27;sink and float&#x27;, Magnetic and Non magnetic and candle and air.

Activities in Children&#x27;s Houses are typically hands-on, tactile materials to teach concepts. For example, to teach writing, students use sandpaper letters. These are letters created by cutting letters out of sandpaper and placing them on wooden blocks. The children then trace these letters with their fingers to learn the shape and sound of each letter. Another example is the use of bead chains to teach math concepts, specifically multiplication. Specifically for multiples of 10, there is one bead that represents one unit, a bar of ten beads put together that represents 1×10, then a flat shape created by fitting 10 of the bars together to represent 10×10, and a cube created by fitting 10 of the flats together to represent 10×10×10. These materials help build a concrete understanding of basic concepts upon which much is built in the later years.

One of the most important benefits of a Montessori school experience is that each child is understood as an individual learner who will naturally seek to excel when their strengths, weaknesses, and interests are understood and taken into account.

=== Elementary classrooms ===

Elementary school classrooms usually serve mixed-age 6- to 9-year-old and 9- to 12-year-old groupings; 6- to 12-year-old groups are also used. Lessons are typically presented to small groups of children, who are then free to follow up with independent work of their own as interest and personal responsibility dictate. Montessori educators give interdisciplinary lessons examining subjects ranging from biology and history to theology, which they refer to as &quot;great lessons.&quot; These lessons are typically given near the beginning of the school term and provide the basis for learning throughout the year. The lessons also offer inspiration and open doors to new areas of investigation.

Lessons include work in language, mathematics, history, the sciences, the arts, etc. Student-directed explorations of resources outside the classroom are integral to education. Montessori used the term &quot;cosmic education&quot; to indicate both the universal scope of lessons to be presented and the idea that education should help children realize the human role in the interdependent functioning of the universe.

Montessori schools are more flexible than traditional schools. In traditional schools, the students sit at tables or desks to do their work. At a Montessori school, the child gets to decide where they would like to work whether that is at a table or on the floor. It is about them going where they feel most comfortable. Anything a child would need during their learning experience is placed on a shelf that the student can easily get to. Montessori classrooms have an age range so that the younger students can look up to the older students and the older students can help the younger students as needed. It gives all age groups a chance to learn from one another.

=== Middle and high school ===

Montessori education for this level is less developed than programs for younger children. Montessori did not establish a teacher training program or a detailed plan of education for adolescents during her lifetime. However, a number of schools have extended their programs for younger children to the middle school and high school levels. In addition, several Montessori organizations have developed teacher training or orientation courses and a loose consensus on the plan of study is emerging. Montessori wrote that &quot;The essential reform of our plan from this point of view may be defined as follows: during the difficult time of adolescence it is helpful to leave the accustomed environment of the family in town and to go to quiet surroundings in the country, close to nature.&quot;

=== Digital technology ===

With the development of mobile touchscreen devices, some Montessori activities have been made into mobile apps.

During the 2020 school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Montessori schools faced a lack of digital and interactive resources as they shifted to hybrid and online learning. This resulted in attempts to bring core materials and lessons to the digital realm with the idea of connecting students at home with familiar materials, and to increase overall access and awareness. Pocket Montessori, which launched in 2020, started with a digital shelf and a few Montessori designed math materials and has since expanded to include a broader range of mathematical materials as well as additional geometry, and language based materials.

Mobile applications have also been criticized due to the lack of physical interaction with objects.

Although not supported by all, most Montessori schools include new technologies with the purpose of preparing students for their future use. Ideally, digital technology is not used in the same way it would be used in most other contemporary classrooms. Instead it is used &quot;in meaningful ways,&quot; not simply to replace &quot;real-world activities with high-tech ones.&quot;

Devices are not commonly used when students are being taught. When students have a question about something, they try to solve it themselves instead of turning to a device to try to figure out an answer. When a device is used by a student, the teacher expects them to use it in a meaningful way. There has to be a specific purpose behind using technology. Before using a device, the student should ask themselves if using this device is the best way or if it is the only way to do a certain task. If the answer is yes to both of those questions, then that would be considered using technology in a meaningful way.

== Montessori&#x27;s philosophy ==

=== Psychology ===

Montessori perceived specific elements of human psychology which her son and collaborator Mario Montessori identified as &quot;human tendencies&quot; in 1957. There is some debate about the exact list, but the following are clearly identified:

==== &quot;Planes&quot; of development ====

Montessori observed four distinct periods, or &quot;planes&quot;, in human development, extending from birth to 6 years, from 6 to 12, from 12 to 18, and from 18 to 24. She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active in each of these planes and called for educational approaches specific to each period.

The first plane extends from birth to around six years of age. During this period, Montessori observed that the child undergoes striking physical and psychological development. The first-plane child is seen as a concrete, sensorial explorer and learner engaged in the developmental work of psychological self-construction and building functional independence. Montessori introduced several concepts to explain this work, including the absorbent mind, sensitive periods, and normalization.

Montessori described the young child&#x27;s behavior of effortlessly assimilating the sensorial stimuli of his or her environment, including information from the senses, language, culture, and the development of concepts with the term &quot;absorbent mind.&quot; She believed that this is a power unique to the first plane, and that it fades as the child approached age six. Montessori also observed and discovered periods of special sensitivity to particular stimuli during this time which she called the &quot;sensitive periods.&quot; In Montessori education, the classroom environment responds to these periods by making appropriate materials and activities available while the periods are active in each individual young child. She identified the following periods and their durations:

* Social behavior—from around to 4 years old
* Sensory refinement—from birth to around 4 years old
* Order—from around 1 to 3 years old
* Interest in small objects—from around 18 months to 3 years old
* Acquisition of language—from birth to around 6 years old

Finally, Montessori observed in children from three to six years old a psychological state she termed &quot;normalization.&quot; Normalization arises from concentration and focus on activity which serves the child&#x27;s developmental needs, and is characterized by the ability to concentrate as well as &quot;spontaneous discipline, continuous and happy work, social sentiments of help and sympathy for others.&quot;

The second plane of development extends from around six years to twelve years old. During this period, Montessori observed physical and psychological changes in children, and she developed a classroom environment, lessons, and materials, to respond to these new characteristics. Physically, she observed the loss of baby teeth and the lengthening of the legs and torso at the beginning of the plane, and a period of uniform growth following. Psychologically, she observed the &quot;herd instinct&quot;, or the tendency to work and socialize in groups, as well as the powers of reason and imagination. Developmentally, she believed the work of the second-plane child is the formation of intellectual independence, of moral sense, and of social organization.

The third plane of development extends from around twelve years to around eighteen years of age, encompassing the period of adolescence. Montessori characterized the third plane by the physical changes of puberty and adolescence, but also psychological changes. She emphasized the psychological instability and difficulties in the concentration of this age, as well as the creative tendencies and the development of &quot;a sense of justice and a sense of personal dignity.&quot; She used the term &quot;valorization&quot; to describe the adolescents&#x27; drive for an externally derived evaluation of their worth. Developmentally, Montessori believed that the work of the third plane child is the construction of the adult self in society.

The fourth plane of development extends from around eighteen years to around twenty-four years old. Montessori wrote comparatively little about this period and did not develop an educational program for the age. She envisioned young adults prepared by their experiences in Montessori education at the lower levels ready to fully embrace the study of culture and the sciences in order to influence and lead civilization. She believed that economic independence in the form of work for money was critical for this age, and felt that an arbitrary limit to the number of years in university-level study was unnecessary, as the study of culture could go on throughout a person&#x27;s life.

=== Relationship to peace ===

Montessori believed that education had an important role in achieving world peace, stating in her 1936 book &quot;Education and Peace&quot; that &quot;[p]reventing conflicts is the work of politics; establishing peace is the work of education.&quot; She felt that children allowed to develop according to their inner laws of development would give rise to a more peaceful and enduring civilization. From the 1930s to the end of her life, she gave a number of lectures and addresses on the subject.

== Studies ==

With an estimated 60,000 Montessori schools worldwide, there have been attempts by researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of Montessori education. Results of these studies have been mixed as there are two main issues with most studies attempting to research the method. The first issue is controlling for the variables in a live classroom while the second is determining the effect sizes of the method versus other factors such as socioeconomic status.

=== Positive evidence of efficacy ===

A 1975 study found that students in a Montessori program from pre-K to grade 2 scored higher on the &quot;Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales&quot; compared to those in traditional programs. In 1981, a review found that Montessori programs performed as well as or better than other early childhood education models in specific areas.

A 2006 study found that Montessori education, when implemented faithfully, fostered social and academic skills that were equal to or superior to those seen in other types of schools. A study in 2007 in Milwaukee Public Schools found that students who had attended Montessori from ages 3 to 11 outperformed their high school classmates in math and science. A meta-analysis in 2003 found that Montessori education had some of the strongest positive effects on student achievement compared to other comprehensive school reform programs.

A 2017 longitudinal study found that students randomly assigned to Montessori schools scored higher on academic tests than peers assigned to traditional public schools.

A 2021 study found that adults who attended Montessori schools for at least two years scored significantly higher on measures of general well-being, engagement, social trust, and self-confidence compared to those who attended conventional schools. These benefits were linked to key Montessori features like self-determination, meaningful activities, and social stability. While the findings suggest that Montessori education may enhance adult well-being, the authors note that unmeasured factors, such as parental influence, could also play a role.

=== Mixed or conditional evidence of efficacy ===

A 2017 review found substantial support for Montessori practices, such as phonics-based literacy and sensory-based mathematics, but concluded that the effects were stronger when Montessori programs adhered to the original method, as opposed to modern, adapted versions. A book the same year emphasized the importance of adherence to the traditional model for better outcomes.

In 2012, a study showed that children in “classic Montessori” programs, where students have greater exposure to Montessori materials, performed better than those in “supplemented Montessori” or conventional classrooms.

In 2020, a study of 195 public Montessori schools across 10 U.S. states found that Montessori students scored lower than district peers in 3rd-grade math but had better ELA outcomes at 3rd and 8th grade. Economically disadvantaged and Black students at Montessori schools achieved higher proficiency rates than their peers in district schools, and Montessori schools had smaller Black-White achievement gaps.

=== Critical evidence of efficacy ===

A 2005 study of a public Montessori magnet school in Buffalo, New York, found no evidence that Montessori enrollment improved academic achievement relative to traditional programs.

== Trademark and branding ==

In 1967, the US Patent and Trademark Office ruled that &quot;the term &#x27;Montessori&#x27; has a generic and/or descriptive significance.&quot; According to many Montessori advocates, the lack of trademark protection has led to public misconceptions of the method due to some schools&#x27; using the term without adhering to Montessori principles.

In the Philippines, officials from the Department of Education commented on the misuse of the term &quot;Montessori&quot; as well as &quot;international schools.&quot; In June 1997, the government issued Order 65 to allow schools to use the term &quot;Montessori&quot; only if they meet certain requirements.

<doc id="313300" wikidata="Q553687" url="?curid=313300" title="Luís Fróis">
<text>Luís Fróis (1532 – 8 July 1597) was a Portuguese Catholic priest and missionary who worked in Asia, most notably Japan, during the second half of the 16th century. As a Jesuit, he preached in Japan during the Sengoku period, meeting with Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He is famous for writing &quot;The First European Description of Japan&quot; and &quot;History of Japan&quot;.

==Biography==
Fróis was born in Lisbon in 1532. He was educated at the court of King João III of Portugal, where a close relative served as a scribe. At an early age, he started working for the Royal Secretary&#x27;s office. In 1548, he joined the Jesuits traveling to Portuguese India to study at Saint Paul&#x27;s College, Goa. He arrived in Goa on 4 September 1548. One of his teachers described Fróis&#x27; character as tough and good natured but not religious. There he met Francis Xavier, who was about to depart for his mission to Japan, and his Japanese collaborator Anjirō.

During his stay in Goa, Fróis reported on the mass conversion of over 200 Kshatriyas to Christianity that had taken place on 25 August 1560 in the village of Batim, in a letter dated 13 November 1560:
Fróis became a priest and confessor in 1561 after completing his theological studies in Goa, where his talents for languages and writing were highly praised. A year later, he was sent to Japan along with Giovanni Battista de Monte to engage in missionary work. On 6 June 1563, after spending several months in Macau, he arrived in Yokoseura, Japan. The following year, he travelled to Kyoto, where he met Ashikaga Yoshiteru who was then &quot;shōgun&quot;. In 1569, he befriended Oda Nobunaga and stayed in his personal residence in Gifu while writing books for a short while. Fróis won Nobunaga&#x27;s trust and was allowed to proselytise in the Kinai region, where he worked together with Gnecchi-Soldo Organtino and others, gaining a large number of followers. In his writings, Nobunaga is portrayed favourably.

After that, he was active in Kyushu, but in 1580, he accompanied the visitor Alessandro Valignano as an interpreter on his visit to Japan, and had an audience with Nobunaga at Azuchi Castle. In 1583, he was ordered by the then Superior General to leave the front line of missionary work and devote himself to recording the activities of the Jesuits in Japan. From then on, Fróis devoted himself to this task, while also traveling around the country to spread his knowledge. This record would later be called the &quot;History of Japan&quot;.

Initially, Toyotomi Hideyoshi continued Nobunaga&#x27;s policy towards the Jesuits. However, as Christian power grew, Hideyoshi became concerned by the attacks on Buddhism and Shintoism, as well as the slave trade of Japanese people. On July 24, 1587, he issued an edict to expel the missionaries. Fróis left Kinai and settled in Nagasaki, which was under the control of Ōmura Sumitada.

In 1590, when Valignano returned to Japan with the Tenshō embassy to Europe, Fróis accompanied him and met with Hideyoshi at Jurakudai. In 1592, he traveled to Macau with Valignano for a time, but returned to Nagasaki in 1595. He died on 8 July 1597 in Nagasaki at the age of 65. Fróis witnessed firsthand the glory and tragedy, the progress and decline of Christian missionary work in Japan, and left behind valuable records of it.

== Publications ==
Noted early on for his talent in writing, Fróis wrote several books. His books have become valuable resources for research into the Sengoku period. His works on history were somewhat expanded by Joāo Rodrigues.

Among his works was the &quot;Treatise&quot; or &quot;The First European Description of Japan&quot; (1585) in which is contained some brief comparisons of the behaviors between the peoples of Europe and Japan (&quot;Tratado em que se contêm muito sucinta e abreviadamente algumas contradições e diferenças de costumes entre a gente de Europa e esta província de Japão&quot;). 

Fróis wrote a book about the history and custom of Japan, titled &quot;Historia de Iapam&quot; (&quot;History of Japan&quot;). In it he gave details about the Jesuit mission in Japan and its most important figures. He described the destruction of Buddhist and Shinto temples as victories over the devil and that Jesuits like Gaspar Coelho encouraged the destruction despite resistance from Japanese Christian nobles.

== Legacy ==
Luís Fróis has a monument at the Twenty-Six Martyrs Museum and Monument in Nagasaki.

==Cultural references==
He was portrayed by Terry O&#x27;Brien in the Japanese TV series &quot;Hideyoshi&quot;. A fictionalized version of Luís Fróis appears in the Capcom game &quot;&quot; and the Japanese light novel &quot;The Ambition of Oda Nobuna.&quot;

<doc id="313303" wikidata="Q836708" url="?curid=313303" title="Star polygon">
<text>In geometry, a star polygon is a type of non-convex polygon. Regular star polygons have been studied in depth; while star polygons in general appear not to have been formally defined, certain notable ones can arise through truncation operations on regular simple or star polygons.

Branko Grünbaum identified two primary usages of this terminology by Johannes Kepler, one corresponding to the regular star polygons with intersecting edges that do not generate new vertices, and the other one to the isotoxal concave simple polygons.

Polygrams include polygons like the pentagram, but also compound figures like the hexagram.

One definition of a &quot;star polygon&quot;, used in turtle graphics, is a polygon having &quot;q&quot; ≥ 2 turns (&quot;q&quot; is called the turning number or density), like in spirolaterals.

==Names==
Star polygon names combine a numeral prefix, such as &quot;&quot;, with the Greek suffix &quot;&quot; (in this case generating the word &quot;pentagram&quot;). The prefix is normally a Greek cardinal, but synonyms using other prefixes exist. For example, a nine-pointed polygon or &quot;enneagram&quot; is also known as a &quot;nonagram&quot;, using the ordinal &quot;nona&quot; from Latin. The &quot;-gram&quot; suffix derives from &quot;&quot; (&quot;grammḗ&quot;), meaning a line. The name &quot;star polygon&quot; reflects the resemblance of these shapes to the diffraction spikes of real stars.

==Regular star polygon==

A &quot;regular star polygon&quot; is a self-intersecting, equilateral, and equiangular polygon.

A regular star polygon is denoted by its Schläfli symbol {&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;}, where &quot;p&quot; (the number of vertices) and &quot;q&quot; (the density) are relatively prime (they share no factors) and where &quot;q&quot; ≥ 2. The density of a polygon can also be called its turning number: the sum of the turn angles of all the vertices, divided by 360°.

The symmetry group of {&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;} is the dihedral group D&quot;p&quot;, of order 2&quot;p&quot;, independent of &quot;q&quot;.

Regular star polygons were first studied systematically by Thomas Bradwardine, and later Johannes Kepler.

===Construction via vertex connection===
Regular star polygons can be created by connecting one vertex of a regular &quot;p&quot;-sided simple polygon to another vertex, non-adjacent to the first one, and continuing the process until the original vertex is reached again. Alternatively, for integers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, it can be considered as being constructed by connecting every &quot;q&quot;th point out of &quot;p&quot; points regularly spaced in a circular placement. For instance, in a regular pentagon, a five-pointed star can be obtained by drawing a line from the 1st to the 3rd vertex, from the 3rd to the 5th vertex, from the 5th to the 2nd vertex, from the 2nd to the 4th vertex, and from the 4th to the 1st vertex.

If &quot;q&quot; ≥ &quot;p&quot;/2, then the construction of {&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;} will result in the same polygon as {&quot;p&quot;/(&quot;p&quot; − &quot;q&quot;)}; connecting every third vertex of the pentagon will yield an identical result to that of connecting every second vertex. However, the vertices will be reached in the opposite direction, which makes a difference when retrograde polygons are incorporated in higher-dimensional polytopes. For example, an antiprism formed from a prograde pentagram {5/2} results in a pentagrammic antiprism; the analogous construction from a retrograde &quot;crossed pentagram&quot; {5/3} results in a pentagrammic crossed-antiprism. Another example is the tetrahemihexahedron, which can be seen as a &quot;crossed triangle&quot; {3/2} cuploid.

====Degenerate regular star polygons====
If &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are not coprime, a degenerate polygon will result with coinciding vertices and edges. For example, {6/2} will appear as a triangle, but can be labeled with two sets of vertices: 1-3 and 4-6. This should be seen not as two overlapping triangles, but as a double-winding single unicursal hexagon.

===Construction via stellation===
Alternatively, a regular star polygon can also be obtained as a sequence of stellations of a convex regular &quot;core&quot; polygon. Constructions based on stellation also allow regular polygonal compounds to be obtained in cases where the density &quot;q&quot; and amount &quot;p&quot; of vertices are not coprime. When constructing star polygons from stellation, however, if &quot;q&quot; &gt; &quot;p&quot;/2, the lines will instead diverge infinitely, and if &quot;q&quot; = &quot;p&quot;/2, the lines will be parallel, with both resulting in no further intersection in Euclidean space. However, it may be possible to construct some such polygons in spherical space, similarly to the monogon and digon; such polygons do not yet appear to have been studied in detail.

==Isotoxal star simple polygons==
When the intersecting line segments are removed from a regular star &quot;n&quot;-gon, the resulting figure is no longer regular, but can be seen as an isotoxal concave simple 2n&quot;-gon, alternating vertices at two different radii. Branko Grünbaum, in &quot;Tilings and patterns&quot;, represents such a star that matches the outline of a regular polygram {&quot;n&quot;/&quot;d&quot;} as |&quot;n&quot;/&quot;d&quot;|, or more generally with {&quot;n&quot;𝛼}, which denotes an isotoxal concave &quot;or convex&quot; simple 2n&quot;-gon with outer internal angle 𝛼.
* For |&quot;n&quot;/&quot;d&quot;|, the outer internal angle degrees, necessarily, and the inner (new) vertices have an external angle degrees, necessarily.
* For {&quot;n&quot;𝛼}, the outer internal and inner external angles, also denoted by 𝛼 and &quot;β&quot;, do not have to match those of any regular polygram {&quot;n&quot;/&quot;d&quot;}; however, degrees and necessarily (here, {&quot;n&quot;𝛼} is concave).
===Examples in tilings===

These polygons are often seen in tiling patterns. The parametric angle 𝛼 (in degrees or radians) can be chosen to match internal angles of neighboring polygons in a tessellation pattern. In his 1619 work &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot;, among periodic tilings, Johannes Kepler includes nonperiodic tilings, like that with three regular pentagons and one regular star pentagon fitting around certain vertices, 5.5.5.5/2, and related to modern Penrose tilings.
==Interiors==
The interior of a star polygon may be treated in different ways. Three such treatments are illustrated for a pentagram. Branko Grünbaum and Geoffrey Shephard consider two of them, as regular star &quot;n&quot;-gons and as isotoxal concave simple 2&quot;n&quot;-gons.

These three treatments are:
* Where a line segment occurs, one side is treated as outside and the other as inside. This is shown in the left hand illustration and commonly occurs in computer vector graphics rendering.
* The number of times that the polygonal curve winds around a given region determines its &quot;density&quot;. The exterior is given a density of 0, and any region of density &gt; 0 is treated as internal. This is shown in the central illustration and commonly occurs in the mathematical treatment of polyhedra. (However, for non-orientable polyhedra, density can only be considered modulo 2 and hence, in those cases, for consistency, the first treatment is sometimes used instead.)
* Wherever a line segment may be drawn between two sides, the region in which the line segment lies is treated as inside the figure. This is shown in the right hand illustration and commonly occurs when making a physical model.

When the area of the polygon is calculated, each of these approaches yields a different result.

==In art and culture==

Star polygons feature prominently in art and culture. Such polygons may or may not be regular, but they are always highly symmetrical. Examples include:
* The {5/2} star pentagon (pentagram) is also known as a pentalpha or pentangle, and historically has been considered by many magical and religious cults to have occult significance.
* The {7/2} and {7/3} star polygons (heptagrams) also have occult significance, particularly in the Kabbalah and in Wicca.
* The {8/3} star polygon (octagram) is a frequent geometrical motif in Mughal Islamic art and architecture; the first is on the emblem of Azerbaijan.
* An eleven pointed star called the hendecagram was used on the tomb of Shah Nematollah Vali.

<doc id="313319" wikidata="Q27399" url="?curid=313319" title="Afrotheria">
<text>Afrotheria ( from Latin &quot;Afro-&quot; &quot;of Africa&quot; + &quot;theria&quot; &quot;wild beast&quot;) is a superorder of placental mammals, the living members of which belong to groups that are either currently living in Africa or of African origin: golden moles, elephant shrews (also known as sengis), otter shrews, tenrecs, aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, sea cows, and several extinct clades. Most groups of afrotheres share little or no superficial resemblance, and their similarities have only become known in recent times because of genetics and molecular studies. Many afrothere groups are found mostly or exclusively in Africa, reflecting the fact that Africa was an island continent from the Cretaceous until the early Miocene around 20 million years ago, when Afro-Arabia collided with Eurasia.

Because Africa was isolated by water, Laurasian groups of mammals such as insectivores, rodents, lagomorphs, carnivorans and ungulates could not reach Africa for much of the early to mid-Cenozoic. Instead, the niches occupied by those groups on the northern continents were filled by various groups of afrotheres via the process of convergent evolution. The small insectivorous afrotheres such as elephant shrews, golden moles, and tenrecs filled the niches of insectivores, the hyraxes filled the roles of rodents and lagomorphs, the aardvarks filled the roles of various medium size ant-eating mammals (anteaters, armadillos, pangolins, echidnas, numbats, etc.) found on other continents throughout the Cenozoic, and proboscideans (elephants and their relatives) filled the roles of large herbivores such as hippos, camels, rhinos, and tapirs. The sirenians developed aquatic body plans and started spreading to other parts of the world by water (evolving convergently with the other groups of marine mammals such as cetaceans and pinnipeds). In addition to their similarity with Laurasian mammals in North America, Europe, and Asia, many afrotheres also exhibit convergent evolution with groups of mammals that evolved and lived exclusively in South America, which was also an island continent for much of the Cenozoic.

The common ancestry of these animals was not recognized until the late 1990s. Historically, the Paenungulata had been linked to the true ungulates (particularly the perissodactyls); the golden mole, tenrecs, and elephant shrews with the traditional (and polyphyletic/incorrect) taxon Insectivora; and the aardvarks with the pangolins and the xenarthrans within the invalid taxon Edentata. Continuing work on the molecular and morphological diversity of afrotherian mammals has provided ever increasing support for their common ancestry.

==Evolutionary relationships==
The afrotherian clade was originally proposed in 1998 based on analyses of DNA sequence data. However, previous studies had hinted at the close interrelationships among subsets of endemic African mammals; some of these studies date to the 1920s and there were sporadic papers in the 1980s and 1990s. The core of the Afrotheria consists of the Paenungulata, i.e., elephants, sea cows, and hyraxes, a group with a long history among comparative anatomists. Hence, while DNA sequence data have proven essential to infer the existence of the Afrotheria as a whole, and while the Afroinsectiphilia (insectivoran-grade afrotheres including tenrecs, golden moles, sengis, and aardvarks) were not recognized as part of Afrotheria without DNA data, some precedent is found in the comparative anatomical literature for the idea that at least part of this group forms a clade. The Paleocene genus &quot;Ocepeia&quot;, which is the most completely-known Paleocene African mammal and the oldest afrotherian known from a complete skull, shares similarities with both Paenungulata and Afroinsectiphilia, and may help to characterize the ancestral body type of afrotherians.

Since the 1990s, increasing molecular and anatomical data have been applied to the classification of animals. Both types of data support the idea that afrotherian mammals are descended from a single common ancestor to the exclusion of other mammals. On the anatomical side, features shared by most, if not all, afrotheres include high vertebral counts, aspects of placental membrane formation, the shape of the ankle bones, the relatively late eruption of the permanent dentition, and undescended testicles remaining in the body near the kidneys. The snout is unusually long and mobile in several Afrotherian species, and this was pointed out as a possible shared-derived character. Studies of genomic data, including millions of aligned nucleotides sampled for a growing number of placental mammals, also support Afrotheria as a clade. Additionally, there might be some dental synapomorphies uniting afroinsectiphilians, if not afrotheres as a whole: p4 talonid and trigonid of similar breadth, a prominent p4 hypoconid, presence of a P4 metacone and absence of parastyles on M1–2.

Afrotheria is now recognized as one of the three major groups within the Eutheria (containing placental mammals). Relations within the three cohorts, Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Boreoeutheria, and the identity of the placental root, remain somewhat controversial.

Afrotheria as a clade has usually been discussed without a Linnaean rank, but has been assigned the rank of cohort, magnorder, and superorder. One reconstruction, which applies the molecular clock, proposes that the oldest split occurred between Afrotheria and the other two some 105 million years ago in the mid-Cretaceous, when the African continent was separated from other major land masses. This idea is consistent with the fossil record of Xenarthra, which is restricted to South America (following recent consensus that &quot;Eurotamandua&quot; is not a xenarthran).

However, Afrotheria itself does not have a fossil record restricted to Africa, and appears in fact to have evolved in the continent&#x27;s isolation. More recent, genomic-scale phylogenies favor the hypothesis that Afrotheria and Xenarthra comprise sister taxa at the base of the placental mammal radiation, suggesting an ancient Gondwanan clade of placental mammals. A 2021 morphological study also proposed to render Meridiungulata polyphyletic and recognise most of its clades as part of a group called Sudamericungulata, closely related to hyraxes, while Litopterna remains a sister taxon to Perissodactyla.

Relations between the various afrotherian orders are still being studied. On the basis of molecular studies, elephants and manatees appear to be related, and likewise elephant shrews and aardvarks. These findings are compatible with the work of earlier anatomists.

===Phylogeny===


==Current status and distribution==
Many extant members of Afrotheria appear to have a high risk of extinction (perhaps related to the large size of many). Species loss within this already small group would comprise a particularly great loss of genetic and evolutionary diversity. The IUCN Afrotheria Specialist Group notes that Afrotheria, as currently reconstructed, includes nearly a third of all mammalian orders currently found in Africa and Madagascar, but only 75 of more than 1,200 mammalian species in those areas.

While most extant species assigned to Afrotheria live in Africa, some (such as the Indian elephant and three of the four sirenian species) occur elsewhere; many of these are also endangered. Prior to the Quaternary extinction event, proboscideans were present on every continent of the world except Australia and Antarctica. Hyraxes lived in much of Eurasia as recently as the end of the Pliocene. The extinct afrotherian orders of embrithopods and desmostylians were also once widely distributed. However, the desmostylians have recently been viewed as possible perissodactyls, rather than afrotheres, although this is still controversial; the taxonomic placement of embrithopods is also not clear.

==Classification==
Afrotheria is a clade of placental mammals, the stem designation for which is Eutheria. Based on precedent, some clades are junior synonyms and arguably should be replaced.

<doc id="313320" wikidata="Q834364" url="?curid=313320" title="Hōjō clan">
<text>The was a Japanese samurai family who controlled the hereditary title of &quot;shikken&quot; (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate between 1203 and 1333. Despite the title, in practice the family wielded actual political power in Japan during this period compared to both the Kamakura shoguns, or the Imperial Court in Kyoto, whose authority was largely symbolic. The Hōjō are known for fostering Zen Buddhism and for leading the successful opposition to the Mongol invasions of Japan. Resentment at Hōjō rule eventually culminated in the overthrow of the clan and the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate.

==History==

===Bloodline===

The Hōjō are alleged to have been an offshoot of the Taira of the Kanmu branch, originating in Izu Province. On the other hand, modern theories question whether the Hōjō clan was really descended from the Taira clan.

They gained power by supporting the defeat of the Taira by supporting the warlord Minamoto no Yoritomo in the Genpei War through both military assistance and by marriage to his blood relatives. Yet, when Yoritomo died eighteen years later, the Hōjō usurped power from his family.

===Rise to power===

Hōjō Tokimasa helped Minamoto no Yoritomo, a son-in-law, defeat the forces of the Taira to become Japan&#x27;s first &quot;shōgun&quot;. Hōjō Masako, Tokimasa&#x27;s daughter, was married to Yoritomo. After the death of Yoritomo, Tokimasa appointed himself as &quot;shikken&quot; (regent) to the former &quot;shōgun&quot;&#x27;s young son, thus effectively transferring control of the shogunate to his clan permanently. Consequently, the shōguns became puppets and hostages of the Hōjō.

===Early events===
The Imperial court at Kyoto resented the decline in its authority during the Kamakura shogunate, while the clan, in turn, came to despise the weak Emperor Go-Toba. In 1221, the Jōkyū War broke out between forces loyal to the recently retired Go-Toba and the second regent Hōjō Yoshitoki. The Hōjō forces easily won the war; the imperial court was brought under the direct control of the shogunate, while the emperor was exiled &quot;to a remote island off western Japan.&quot; The &quot;shōgun&quot;″s constables were granted extensive civil powers, and the court was obliged to seek the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s approval for all of its actions. Although deprived of political power, the court was permitted to maintain its estates in Kyoto since it conveyed needed legitimacy on the otherwise unlawful rule of the shogunate.

Several significant administrative achievements were made during the Hōjō regency. In 1225 the third regent, Hōjō Yasutoki, established the &quot;Hyōjōsho&quot; (Council of State), which ended the threat of civil war by enabling potential rivals of the Hōjō to share in the shogunate&#x27;s decision-making and political power. The Hōjō regent presided over the council, which was a successful form of collective leadership. The adoption of Japan&#x27;s first military code of law — the &quot;Goseibai Shikimoku&quot; — in 1232 reflected the profound transition from an era of direct Imperial rule to the military dictatorship of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. While legal practices in Kyoto were still based on 500-year-old Confucian principles, the new code was a highly legalistic document that stressed the duties of stewards and constables, provided means for settling land disputes, and established rules governing inheritances. It was clear and concise, stipulated punishments for violators of its conditions, and remained in effect for the next 635 years.

*Hōjō Sanetoki
*Hōjō Masako

<text>Howard Barton Unruh (January 21, 1921 – October 19, 2009) was an American mass murderer who shot and killed thirteen people during a twelve-minute walk through his neighborhood in Camden, New Jersey, on September 6, 1949 in an incident that became known as the Walk of Death. Unruh was found criminally insane and died in 2009 after a lengthy illness at the age of 88 following 60 years of confinement.

The shooting remains the deadliest mass shooting in New Jersey history, and is one of the first examples of a mass shooting in post-WW2 US history.

==Background and possible motives for killings==
Howard Unruh was the son of Samuel Shipley Unruh and Freda E. Vollmer. He had a younger brother, James; they were raised by their mother after their parents separated. Unruh grew up in East Camden, New Jersey, attended Cramer Junior High School and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in January 1939. The Woodrow Wilson High School yearbook from 1939 indicated that he was shy and that his ambition was to become a government employee.

Unruh enlisted in the United States Army on October 27, 1942, and saw active service as an armor crewman across Europe between October 1944 and July 1945. He was remembered by his section chief, Norman E. Koehn, as a first-class soldier who never drank, swore, or chased girls and spent much time reading his Bible and writing long letters to his mother. It was also cited that Unruh kept meticulous notes on the enemies killed in battles, down to the details of the corpses. He was awarded the European Theater of Operations Medal, the Victory Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal. Unruh was honorably discharged at the end of the war and returned to New Jersey to live with his mother. Both his brother and his father later indicated that Unruh&#x27;s wartime experiences had changed him, making him moody, nervous, and detached.

Unruh briefly found work as a sheet-metal worker before enrolling at the Temple University School of Pharmacy in Philadelphia but quit after a month citing &quot;poor physical condition&quot; as the reason. Supported by his mother&#x27;s income working in a soap factory, he hung about their house, decorating it with his medals, reading his Bible, and practicing his shooting in the basement, which he&#x27;d turned into a practice range.

It was around this time that Unruh&#x27;s relations with his neighbors began to deteriorate and his resentment grew over what he regarded as &quot;derogatory remarks made about my character.&quot; His brother James pointed to an ongoing feud between Unruh and his neighbor, pharmacist Maurice Cohen, over Unruh&#x27;s use of Cohen&#x27;s backyard as a means to access his apartment. Prior to the killings, Unruh went to a movie theater in Philadelphia and sat through several shows before returning home around 3 a.m. He had gone to the theater to meet a man, with whom he&#x27;d been having a weeks-long affair, for a date, but was delayed and arrived to find that the man had gone. Upon his return home, a gate he had installed that day had been removed.

==Shootings==
At approximately 7 a.m. on September 6, 1949, Unruh ate a breakfast prepared by his mother, who then left to visit a neighbor, Carolina Pinner. At about 9:20 a.m., armed with his Luger P08 pistol, an eight-round magazine, and more ammunition carried in his pockets, he left his apartment and walked out onto River Road in Camden. Approaching a bread-delivery truck, Unruh shoved his pistol through the door and shot at the driver. He missed his shot by a few inches and the driver unsuccessfully attempted to warn residents.

Unruh visited the shop of one of his neighbors, shoemaker John Pilarchik, whom he shot and killed instantly. He next visited the barbershop of another neighbor, Clark Hoover, who was cutting the hair of six-year-old Orris Smith. He shot Hoover in the head and Smith in the neck, both fatally. Running to Cohen&#x27;s pharmacy, Unruh encountered insurance man James Hutton and killed him when he didn&#x27;t move out of his way.

Unruh proceeded to the rear of the pharmacy and saw Cohen and his wife Rose running up the stairs into their apartment. Once in the apartment, Cohen climbed through a window and onto the porch roof, while Rose hid herself and their son, 12-year-old Charles, in separate closets. However, Unruh discovered the closet Rose was hiding in and shot three times through the door before opening it and firing once more into her face. Walking across the apartment, he spotted Cohen&#x27;s mother Minnie, age 63, trying to call the police, and shot her several times. He then followed Cohen onto a porch roof and shot him in the back, causing him to fall to the pavement below. Charles, still hiding in the second closet, managed to escape undetected.

Unruh then walked into the middle of River Road and fired at an approaching sedan, killing the driver, Alvin Day, and causing the car to careen onto the sidewalk. He then visited the business of tailor Thomas Zegrino; he was not there, but his wife Helga was and was killed by the gunman. Zegrino was the only one of Unruh&#x27;s intended targets to survive the rampage.

After firing through the locked front door of a grocery store, Unruh approached a car waiting at the intersection and shot the occupants: Helen Wilson, her son John, and mother Emma Matlack; the two women died instantly, while the boy died later at Cooper Hospital. Unruh then fired through an apartment window, killing two-year-old Thomas Hamilton. The child&#x27;s caregiver, Irene Rice, collapsed upon witnessing the shooting and was treated for severe shock. Unruh later claimed that he didn&#x27;t know whom he saw in the window or whether he hit them. Unruh next fired upon another car coming down the street; its occupants, Charles Peterson and James Crawford, managed to escape to a nearby tavern and survived.

Witness William McNeely saw Frank Engel run out of the tavern and shoot at Unruh, but he apparently missed and then ran back inside. In fact, he had succeeded in shooting Unruh in the leg, as police discovered only at the end of a lengthy interview with Unruh. Unruh fired at several other people across the street, missing them. He then found Madeline Harris and her son Armand outside their home hanging out blankets to dry and shot at them; both were injured but survived.

Hearing police sirens in the distance, Unruh returned to his apartment, which was soon surrounded by police. The first officer on the scene was Detective William E. Kelly Sr. A gunfight ensued, during which journalist Philip Buxton of the Camden &quot;Evening Courier&quot; found Unruh&#x27;s number in the local telephone directory and dialled it. Unruh answered in what was described as &quot;a strong, clear voice&quot; and had the following conversation with Buxton:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Is this Howard?&quot;
&quot;Yes ... what&#x27;s the last name of the party you want?&quot;
&quot;Unruh.&quot;
(Pause) &quot;What&#x27;s the last name of the party you want?&quot;
&quot;Unruh. I&#x27;m a friend, and I want to know what they&#x27;re doing to you.&quot;
&quot;They&#x27;re not doing a damned thing to me, but I&#x27;m doing plenty to them.&quot;
(In a soothing, reassuring voice) &quot;How many have you killed?&quot;
&quot;I don&#x27;t know yet, because I haven&#x27;t counted them ... (pause) but it looks like a pretty good score.&quot;
&quot;Why are you killing people?&quot;
&quot;I don&#x27;t know. I can&#x27;t answer that yet, I&#x27;m too busy.&quot;
(At that point Buxton heard Unruh move away from the phone as gunfire was heard in the background)
&quot;I&#x27;ll have to talk to you later ... a couple of friends are coming to get me&quot; ... (voice trails off).&lt;/poem&gt;

The gunfight ended when police threw two tear gas bombs into the apartment, the second of which went off, filling the room with gas. Two armed officers, patrolman Charles Hance and Captain Everett Joslin, went up to the first floor of the building and shouted, &quot;Come down with your hands up&quot; to which Unruh replied, &quot;I give up. Don&#x27;t shoot.&quot; Unruh emerged from the room and stumbled down the stairs, fell at the feet of the officers, and was handcuffed by Sergeant Earl Wright.

It was later determined that the shooter fired a total of 33 rounds during his rampage. Detectives found an apartment filled with what was described as an arsenal of weapons, guns, knives, bullet-making equipment, and more than 700 rounds. In a drawer were several marksmanship medals and in the basement was Unruh&#x27;s target range. On a table was a Bible opened to Matthew, Chapter 24. Police also found books relating to sex hygiene.

==Arrest and confinement==

Under police interrogation, Unruh gave a meticulous account of his actions, which was later released by Camden County prosecutor Mitchell Cohen (no relation to Maurice Cohen). Only at the end of this interrogation did police discover that Unruh had a bullet wound in his left thigh. He was subsequently taken to Cooper Hospital for treatment, where his thirteenth victim, John Wilson, was already dying.

Charges were filed for thirteen counts of &quot;willful and malicious slayings with malice aforethought&quot; and three counts of &quot;atrocious assault and battery.&quot; Unruh was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia by psychologists and found to be insane, making him immune to criminal prosecution. When he was able to leave Cooper Hospital, Unruh was sent to the New Jersey Hospital for the Insane (now Trenton Psychiatric Hospital), to be held in a private cell in the maximum-security Vroom Building. He remained incarcerated there until his death in 2009. Unruh&#x27;s last public words, made during an interview with a psychologist, were, &quot;I&#x27;d have killed a thousand if I had enough bullets.&quot;

==Victims==
Unruh killed 13 and injured three. Those killed, and their ages, were:

*John Joseph Pilarchik, 27
*Orris Martin Smith, 6
*Clark Hoover, 45
*James Hutton, 46
*Rose Cohen, 38
*Minnie Cohen, 63
*Dr. Maurice J. Cohen, 39
*Alvin Day, 24
*Thomas Hamilton, 2
*Helga Kautzach Zegrino, 28
*Emma Matlack, 68
*Helen Wilson, 37
*John Wilson, 9
==Related events==
Meyer Berger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; won the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for his 4,000-word story on the killings.

Maurice and Rose Cohen&#x27;s son Charles, then aged 12, survived the murder of his family by hiding in a closet. Charles H. Cohen (January 31, 1937 – September 4, 2009) was the maternal grandfather of Carly Novell, who survived the shooting incident of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, by hiding in a closet like her grandfather did in 1949. Cohen died at the age of 72 on September 4, 2009, and was buried two days later on September 6, 2009—the 60th anniversary of the mass murder, and just one month before Unruh&#x27;s death.

<text>A sin-eater is a person who consumes a ritual meal in order to spiritually take on the sins of a deceased person. The food was believed to absorb the sins of a recently dead person, thus absolving the soul of the person.

Cultural anthropologists and folklorists classify sin-eating as a form of ritual. It is most commonly associated with Scotland, Ireland, Wales, English counties bordering Wales, and Welsh culture.

==Attestations==
===History===
While there have been analogous instances of sin-eaters throughout history, the questions of how common the practice was, when it was practiced, and what the interactions between sin-eaters, common people, and religious authorities remain largely unstudied by folklore academics.

In Meso-American civilisation, Tlazolteotl, the Aztec goddess of vice, purification, steam baths, lust and filth, and a patroness of adulterers (her name literally means &#x27;Sacred Filth&#x27;), had a redemptive role in religious practices. At the end of an individual&#x27;s life, they were allowed to confess misdeeds to this deity, and according to legend she would cleanse the soul by &quot;eating its filth&quot;.

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states in its article on sin-eaters:

===In Wales and the Welsh Marches===
The term &quot;Sin-eater&quot; appears to derive from Welsh culture and is most often associated with Wales itself and in the English counties bordering Wales.

Seventeenth-century diarist John Aubrey, in the earliest source on the practice, wrote that &quot;an old Custome&quot; in Herefordshire had been

John Bagford () includes the following description of the sin-eating ritual in his &quot;Letter on Leland&#x27;s Collectanea&quot;, i. 76. (as cited in Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 1898)

By 1838, Catherine Sinclair noted the practice was in decline but that it continued in the locality:

A local legend in Shropshire, England, concerns the grave of Richard Munslow, who died in 1906, said to be the last sin-eater of the area. Unusually, Munslow was not poor or an outcast, instead being a wealthy farmer from an established family. Munslow may have revived the custom after the deaths of three of his children in a week 1870 due to scarlet fever. In the words of local Reverend Norman Morris of Ratlinghope, &quot;It was a very odd practice and would not have been approved of by the church but I suspect the vicar often turned a blind eye to the practice.&quot; At the funeral of anyone who had died without confessing their sins, a sin-eater would take on the sins of the deceased by eating a loaf of bread and drinking ale out of a wooden bowl passed over the coffin, and make a short speech:

The 1926 book &quot;Funeral Customs&quot; by Bertram S. Puckle mentions the sin-eater:

<doc id="313334" wikidata="Q2736120" url="?curid=313334" title="Hosokawa clan">
<text>The  is a Japanese samurai kin group or clan. The clan descends from the Seiwa Genji, a branch of the Minamoto clan, and ultimately from Emperor Seiwa, through the Ashikaga clan. It produced many prominent officials in the Ashikaga shogunate&#x27;s administration. In the Edo period, the clan was one of the largest landholding daimyo families in Japan. The current clan head Morihiro Hosokawa served as Prime Minister of Japan.

==Muromachi and Sengoku periods==
Ashikaga Yoshisue, son of Ashikaga Yoshizane, was the first to take the surname of Hosokawa. Hosokawa Yoriharu, a Hosokawa of the late Kamakura period, fought for the Ashikaga clan against the Kamakura shogunate. Another, Hosokawa Akiuji, helped establish the Ashikaga shogunate.

The clan wielded significant power over the course of the Muromachi (1336–1467), Sengoku (1467–1600), and Edo periods, moving, however, from Shikoku, to Kinai, and then to Kyūshū over the centuries.

The clan was also one of three families to dominate the post of Kanrei (Shōgun&#x27;s deputy), under the Ashikaga shogunate. One such individual was Hosokawa Yoriyuki. At the beginning of the Ashikaga&#x27;s rule, the Hosokawa were given control of the entirety of Shikoku. Over the course of this period, members of the Hosokawa clan were Constables (&quot;shugo&quot;) of Awa, Awaji, Bitchū, Izumi, Sanuki, Settsu, Tanba, Tosa, and Yamashiro Provinces.

A conflict between Hosokawa Katsumoto, the fifth Kanrei, and his father-in-law Yamana Sōzen, over the shogunate&#x27;s succession, sparked the Ōnin War, which led to the fall of the shogunate and a period of 150 years of chaos and war, known as the Sengoku period. Following the fall of the Ashikaga shogunate, which was based in Kyoto, control of the city, and thus ostensibly the country, fell into the hands of the Hosokawa clan (who held the post of Kyoto Kanrei – Shōgun&#x27;s deputy in Kyoto) for a few generations.

Katsumoto&#x27;s son, Hosokawa Masamoto, held power in this way at the end of the 15th century, but was assassinated in 1507. After his death, the clan became divided and was weakened by internecine fighting. What power they still had, however, was centered in and around Kyoto. This gave them the leverage to consolidate their power to some extent, and came to be strong rivals with the Ōuchi clan, both politically, and in terms of dominating trade with Ming China. The Hosokawa remained in Kyoto for roughly one hundred years, fleeing the city when it was attacked by lord Oda Nobunaga. Another division of the clan whom many believed became extinct is the Saikyū clan (細九氏).

==Edo period==


The Hosokawa of Kokura (later Kumamoto) became the &quot;main&quot; line of the Hosokawa clan during the Edo period. Hosokawa Gracia, the wife of Hosokawa Tadaoki, was one of the most famous samurai converts to Christianity; she was also the daughter of Akechi Mitsuhide.

The Hosokawa sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu against Ishida Mitsunari during the decisive Sekigahara Campaign, and thus were made &quot;fudai&quot; (inside) &quot;daimyō&quot; under the Tokugawa shogunate. They were given Higo Province, with an income of 540,000 &quot;koku&quot;, as their &quot;han&quot; (fief).

Hosokawa Tadatoshi, the third lord of Kumamoto, was the patron of the artist and swordsman Miyamoto Musashi.Though the Hosokawa domain was far from both the shogunate and imperial capital, on Kyūshū, they were among the wealthiest of the &quot;daimyōs&quot;. By 1750, Higo was one of the top producers of rice, and was in fact counted as a standard by the Osaka rice brokers. The domain suffered from serious economic decline after that, as most domains did, but the sixth lord, Hosokawa Shigekata (1718–1785, r. 1747–1785) instituted a number of reforms which turned the situation around. He also founded a Han school, Jishūkan, in 1755.
In later years, it produced many scholars such as Yokoi Shōnan.

In 1787, the main family line descended from Tadatoshi became extinct with the death of the 7th lord, Shigekata&#x27;s son Harutoshi (1758–1787; r. 1785–1787). He was succeeded by his distant cousin Narishige, the sixth Lord of Udo (1755–c1835, r. 1787–1810) a direct descendant of Tadatoshi&#x27;s younger brother Tatsutaka (1615–1645). In 1810, Narishige abdicated his title in favor of his elder son Naritatsu (1788–1826, r. 1810–1826), who succeeded as the ninth lord of Kumamoto. Naritatsu died without an heir in 1826, and was succeeded by his nephew Narimori (1804–1860, r. 1826–1860), the son of Naritatsu&#x27;s younger brother Tatsuyuki (1784–1818), who was the seventh lord of Udo.

Following the death of Narimori in 1860, his elder son Yoshikuni (1835–1876, r. 1860–1871) succeeded him as the eleventh and final ruling lord of Kumamoto.

There were four major branches of the Hosokawa clan in the Edo period, each of which held the title of &quot;daimyō&quot;. Another two branches of the family, under the Nagaoka surname, served the Hosokawa of Kumamoto as &quot;karō&quot;. The residence of one of those families, , is still extant, and is a Tangible Cultural Property of Kumamoto Prefecture.

==Boshin War==
During the Boshin War of 1868–69, the Hosokawa of Kumamoto, Kumamoto-Shinden, and Udo sided with the imperial government. Its forces took part in the Battle of Aizu and the Battle of Hakodate, among others.

==Meiji and beyond==
Following the abolition of the feudal class in 1871, the Hosokawa clan and its branches were made part of the new nobility in the Meiji era. The head of the main family line (Kumamoto) was given the hereditary title of marquis (&quot;kōshaku&quot;), while the heads of the secondary branches became viscounts (&quot;shishaku&quot;); the titles became obsolete in 1947. The present head of the main family line, Morihiro Hosokawa, former Prime Minister of Japan, is a descendant of the Hosokawa of Kumamoto.

<text>Zviad Konstantines dze Gamsakhurdia (; ; 31 March 1939 – 31 December 1993) was a Georgian politician, human rights activist, dissident, professor of English language studies and American literature at Tbilisi State University, and writer who became the first democratically elected President of Georgia in May 1991.

A prominent exponent of Georgian nationalism and pan-Caucasianism, Zviad Gamsakhurdia was involved in Soviet dissident movement from his youth. His activities attracted attention of authorities in the Soviet Union and Gamsakhurdia was arrested and imprisoned numerous times. Gamsakhurdia co-founded the Georgian Helsinki Group, which sought to bring attention to human rights violations in the Soviet Union.

He organized numerous pro-independence protests in Georgia, one of which in 1989 was suppressed by the Soviet Army, with Gamsakhurdia being arrested. Eventually, a number of underground political organizations united around Zviad Gamsakhurdia and formed the Round Table—Free Georgia coalition, which successfully challenged the ruling Communist Party of Georgia in the 1990 elections. Gamsakhurdia was elected as the President of Georgia in 1991, gaining 87% of votes in the election. Despite popular support, Gamsakhurdia found significant opposition from the urban intelligentsia and former Soviet nomenklatura, as well as from his own ranks. In early 1992 Gamsakhurdia was overthrown by warlords Tengiz Kitovani, Jaba Ioseliani and Tengiz Sigua, two of which were formerly allied with Gamsakhurdia. Gamsakhurdia was forced to flee to Chechnya, where he was greeted by Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev. His supporters continued to fight the post-coup government of Eduard Shevardnadze. In September 1993, Gamsakhurdia returned to Georgia and tried to regain power. Despite initial success, the rebellion was eventually crushed by government forces with the help of the Russian military. Gamsakhurdia was forced into hiding in Samegrelo, a Zviadist stronghold. He was found dead in early 1994 in controversial circumstances. His death remains uninvestigated to this day.

After the civil war ended, the government continued to suppress Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s supporters, even with brutal tactics. After Eduard Shevardnadze was overthrown during the 2003 Rose Revolution, Gamsakhurdia was rehabilitated by the President Mikheil Saakashvili.

== Early life and education ==
Zviad Konstantinovich Gamsakhurdia was born in the Georgian capital Tbilisi on 31 March 1939; his father, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, was a prominent Georgian writer during the 20th century. Konstantine held nationalist views and was imprisoned in the 1920s, but evaded the Stalinist purges and became influential as a historical novelist. He and his circle of fellow writers promoted Georgian culture and ethnic particularism in the Soviet centre. Zviad was raised in an intellectual setting, which encouraged attention to traditional Georgian history, culture and national identity.

At 16, Gamsakhurdia established an underground nationalist youth group called &quot;Gorgasliani&quot;. In 1956 he participated with his fellow students, including future ally Merab Kostava, in the demonstrations in Tbilisi against de-Stalinization. He and a group of friends began distributing anti-communist Georgian nationalist pamphlets in December; they were caught and taken to court. He was arrested again in 1958 for distributing anti-communist literature and was confined to a mental hospital in Tbilisi for six months, although his familial status protected him from further sanctions. In mental hospital, Gamsakhurdia was diagnosed as suffering &quot;psychopathy with decompensation&quot;, becoming an early victim of the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.

After his release, he continued studying Western languages and literature at Tbilisi State University, eventually graduating with a degree in philology and becoming a lecturer of English language and American literature at Tbilisi State University in 1963. He also found employment at the Institute of Literature of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, and joined the Georgian Writers&#x27; Union in 1966. As an academic, Gamsakhurdia turned his focus to promoting Georgian culture, criticizing falsification of history, and supporting the Georgian Orthodox Church.

== Human rights activism ==
In the 1970s, Gamsakhurdia and his dissident intellectual circle began making contact with Russian dissidents and with the Western press. In mid-1974, he co-founded a Human Rights Defense Group with Kostava and others; in 1977 they established the Georgian branch of the Helsinki Rights Watch Group. It worked with the Moscow Helsinki Group and other Helsinki Groups throughout the country, all set up to monitor the Soviet implementation of the 1975 Helsinki Agreement, which was co-signed by Leonid Brezhnev and called for protection of human rights such as freedom of thought, conscience, religion and national self-determination. Gamsakhurdia was also active in the underground network of &quot;samizdat&quot; publishers, contributing to a wide variety of underground political periodicals. In their publications, Gamsakhurdia and Kostava denounced corruption, treatment of cultural heritage, the prison system, deportation of Meskhetian Muslims, and other controversies. Although he was frequently harassed and occasionally arrested for his dissidence, for a long time Gamsakhurdia avoided serious punishment, probably as a result of his family&#x27;s prestige and political connections.

Despite being an insider in the Georgian Writers&#x27; Union, Gamsakhurdia was expelled from the Union on 1 April 1977 after they had received information from the prosecutor&#x27;s office about his illegal dissident activities. Later that month, Gamsakhurdia was arrested along with Kostava; they were accused of anti-Soviet activities, including illegal distribution of books and periodicals. They spent a year imprisoned before both being convicted and sentenced to three years in prison and two in exile. Following their imprisonment, the Georgian Helsinki Group ceased to exist. In 1978, Gamsakhurdia was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1979, he was released after publicly denouncing his dissident activism. His supporters, family and Merab Kostava claimed that his recantation was coerced by the KGB. Unlike Gamsakhurdia, Kostava did not recant and remained in prison until 1987, and Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s reputation suffered. Following his release, Gamsakhurdia returned to his literary work and organizing. He continued his dissident activity, contributing to samizdat periodicals and campaigning for the release of Kostava. Gamsakhurdia was arrested again in October 1981 after attending a human-rights demonstration in Mtskheta. He was placed under house arrest from 19821983 for his campaigning on Kostava&#x27;s behalf.

== Pro-independence movement ==

As the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched his &quot;glasnost&quot; reform which allowed for greater freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, the grass-roots political activism increased and eventually became commonplace in Georgia and other Soviet republics. In the spring of 1985, the Georgian Helsinki Group was restarted and in 1987, as Merab Kostava and other dissidents were released from prison, the dissident movement, which had been gaining steam, was strengthened by new leadership. Gamsakhurdia was attacked in the press as the authorities attempted to undermine the nationalist movement. In the context of &quot;glasnost&quot;, the nationalist discourse among the intelligentsia was heightened, but still sharply divided on the issue of independence.

In 1988, Gamsakhurdia became one of the founders of the Society of Saint Ilia the Righteous (SSIR), a religious-political organization which became the basis for his own political movement. Through the SSIR and the Helsinki Group, which was transformed into the Georgian Helsinki Union party in September 1989, Gamsakhurdia took part in organizing almost all of the mass protest actions demanding the independence in late 1980s. On 9 April 1989, the brutal suppression by Soviet forces of a large peaceful demonstration held in Tbilisi, proved to be a pivotal event in discrediting the continuation of Soviet rule over the country.

The central Soviet government responded by the significant changes in the Georgia&#x27;s leadership, replacing its heads Jumber Patiashvili and Zurab Chkheidze. The new leadership chose a more conciliatory approach towards the opposition. The opposition leaders arrested during the 9 April tragedy, including Zviad Gamsakhurdia, were released from prison and given a greater role in the decision-making. In recognition of his enormous popularity, Gamsakhurdia was brought into negotiations with the new Soviet Georgian leader Givi Gumbaridze over impeding legislation in the Georgia&#x27;s Supreme Soviet. It passed a number of measures demanded by the opposition, paving path towards the independence. Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s organizations soon gained support in almost all Georgian institutions and Gamsakhurdia played a prominent role in their decisions to break their ties with the Kremlin. In February 1990, the Georgian sports association announced that it was breaking off the Soviet championships, holding its own championships with a goal of sending its team to international competitions. The ceremonies inaugurating the independent Georgian games began with Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s opening remarks. The Georgian trade union organization broke off all-Union trade union organization, while the republican Komsomol declared independence from the Communist Party and all-Union Komsomol, later dissolving itself, being replaced by the new youth groups. Through political strikes, mass demonstrations, hunger strikes and vigils, the opposition led by Gamsakhurdia forced the Soviet leadership to make concessions on many issues.

== Head of Georgia ==

=== Rise to power ===
The progress of democratic reforms was accelerated and led to Soviet Georgia&#x27;s first democratic multiparty elections, held on 28 October 1990. On 11–13 March 1990, during the meetings of pro-independence opposition parties of the Soviet Georgia in the Tbilisi Philharmonic Hotel in order to establish the &quot;coordinating council&quot;, a split became evident in the pro-independence opposition, with two groups having different visions for the path towards independence. Gamsakhurdia and his followers argued that opposition had to come to power first through winning official elections to the Supreme Soviet and then declare independence through peaceful means, using existing legal procedures. Meanwhile, the second faction, led by Giorgi Chanturia&#x27;s National Democratic Party and Irakli Tsereteli&#x27;s National Independence Party, argued that Georgia needed to &quot;win freedom before achieving independence&quot;. They argued for electing an alternative representative body and boycotting the official elections, claiming that taking part in the official elections would only serve to &quot;legitimize the colonial status of Georgia within the Soviet system&quot;. In April, Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s Helsinki Union left the forum and joined by the Monarchist Party, the Saint Ilya the Just Society, the Merab Kostava Society and other opposition groups, it established the &quot;Round Table — Free Georgia&quot; (&quot;Mrgvali Magida — Tavisupali Sakartvelo&quot;) coalition. Led by Gamsakhurdia, the coalition argued for a peaceful transition, citing the example of Baltic republics. A second faction meanwhile set its own alternative elections for the &quot;National Congress&quot;, which it imagined as a &quot;transitional legislative body&quot; of national liberation movement to achieve independence. However, with the absence of Round Table and later withdrawal of People&#x27;s Front party, its claims on being an alternative legislative body representing &quot;the will of the Georgian people&quot; was undermined.

Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s Round Table coalition run on the ardently pro-independence platform in the October election. Gamsakhurdia campaigned tirelessly, often travelling to distant parts of Georgia in one day and holding large rallies at sports arenas. The Round Table coalition secured a convincing victory, with 64% of the vote, as compared with the Georgian Communist Party&#x27;s 29.6%. Gamsakhurdia himself won his own race in a Tbilisi district with over 70 percent of the vote. On 14 November 1990, Zviad Gamsakhurdia was elected by an overwhelming majority as chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia, which made him &quot;de facto&quot; head of Georgia, albeit not a sovereign country yet.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFE/RL, Incorporated-1990&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gamsakhurdia was voted as Georgia&#x27;s new leader with 238 votes in favor to 5 against.

In April 1991, Gamsakhurdia was among six candidates who registered for the presidential election. The election was held on 26 May, in a free and democratic environment. On 28 May 1991, the state newspaper &quot;Republic of Georgia&quot; released preliminary results, showing Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s lead by a large margin, with Gamsakhurdia securing 86.52% of votes, while Valerian Advadze, who took second position, securing 7.52% of votes. On 3 June, the Central Election Commission approved a summery protocol of the election, with 86.5%, that is, 2 565 362 out of 3 594 810 voters, supporting Zviad Gamsakhurdia.

=== Programme ===
According to Stephen F. Jones, a historian and specialist on Russian and Eurasian studies, Gamsakhurdia promoted the concept of pan-Caucasian unity, &quot;Caucasian House&quot;. Gamsakhurdia favored regional cooperation between peoples of the Caucasus and considered concepts such as a common economic zone, a &quot;Caucasian Forum&quot; (a regional United Nations) and an alliance against foreign interference. &quot;Caucasian House&quot; was based on the idea of shared Ibero-Caucasian languages and common tribal and cultural identity among autochthonous Caucasian nations, such as Chechens, Circassians, Abkhazians and Georgians. An allegiance between Gamsakhurdia and Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev was seen as pivotal to its success. However, Gamsakhurdia was soon overthrown after taking office, so the &quot;realisation of the idea of Caucasianness and the Caucasian House has never gone beyond the declaratory level or imaginative projects...&quot;.

In his election program, Gamsakhurdia argued for gradual privatization and transition from socialist command economy to capitalist market economy. He supported social market economy, a model which would synthesize &quot;free labor and guarantees of social rights, respect for private property and social utility, free entrepreneurship and honest competition&quot;. This included support for: wage indexation, consumer protection, social protection of vulnerable groups, minimum wage, unemployment benefits etc. Gamsakhurdia supported price controls for certain and the most basic products.

Gamsakhurdia was a deeply religious person. He believed that existing societal problems, including crime, resulted from the destruction of faith, decline of morality, and the abandonment and degradation of spiritual ideals. Gamsakhurdia thought that Georgia&#x27;s political struggle for independence involved not only &quot;national and political goals&quot;, but also &quot;a moral revival based on religious faith and conscience&quot;.

Gamsakhurdia and his supporters believed in a strong presidential system. They argued that to overcome the challenges, the country needed a strong president elected by universal suffrage. These views were shared by most Georgians. In one of his interviews, Gamsakhurdia cited Charles de Gaulle as his &quot;political ideal&quot;.

=== Policies ===

==== Domestic policy ====
Upon Gamsakhurdia taking office in November 1990, one of the first laws passed by the Georgia&#x27;s Supreme Council under his leadership renamed the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic into the &quot;Republic of Georgia&quot; and restored the state hymn, flag and seal of the Georgia&#x27;s First Republic. The new Supreme Council declared a &quot;transitional period&quot; towards the independence, a period during which the newly elected government was to prepare the political-legal and economic foundations to the sovereign existence of Georgia. The Supreme Council appointed Tengiz Sigua, a member of an opposition Rustaveli Society, as the chairman of the Georgian Council of Ministers (later renamed into a post of prime minister).

Though state authorities continued to operate under the 1976 Soviet Georgian Constitution, several changes were adopted following independence to create a presidential republic. Gamsakhurdia made efforts to root out the influence of mafia from the Soviet-era institutions like KGB, military and police. His one of the first conflicts with Mikhail Gorbachev occurred over designating a candidate who would become the head of Georgian KGB. Gamsakhurdia also took steps to create a new military structure independent from the Soviet control. In December 1990, the Georgia&#x27;s Supreme Council adopted the law which ended Soviet military draft in Georgia. As a result, only 10 percent of eligible draftees responded to call-up, the lowest percentage among all Soviet republics. Instead, in January 1991 the Georgia&#x27;s Supreme Council approved the legislation which created the National Guard of Georgia. The first military parade was held on Independence Day in 1991, with 10,000 soldiers of the National Guard taking their oath of service in front of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia at Boris Paichadze Stadium. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, through the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Anatoly Lukyanov, instructed Gamsakhurdia to ban the creation of the Guard. The official newspaper of the Soviet Army, &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot;, published an article mocking the National Guard entitled &quot;Mr. Prefects and Mr. Guardsmen&quot;.

Georgia held a referendum on restoring its pre-Soviet independence on 31 March 1991 in which 98.9% of those who voted declared in its favour. The Georgian parliament passed a declaration of independence on 9 April 1991, in effect restoring the 1918–1921 Georgian sovereign state. However, it was not recognized by the Soviet Union and although a number of foreign powers granted early recognition, universal recognition did not come until the following year. Romania became the first country to recognize the Georgian independence, on 26 August 1991.

In August 1991, Georgia created a national bank and the legislature committed Georgia to issue its own currency in the future. In September 1991, the law on privatization was passed after long discussions on how to prevent &quot;party-economic mafia&quot; (a term used by Gamsakhurdia to refer to Communist Party leaders and administrators at various levels who controlled shadow economy of the Soviet Georgia) from becoming the primary beneficiary. On 3 May 1991, Gamsakhurdia issued a decree implementing fixed prices for some basic goods and lifting the national 5-percent sales tax on some food and services.

The first steps towards the abolition of death penalty in Georgia came during the government of Gamsakhurdia on 20 March 1991, when the Georgian Supreme Council removed this possible punishment for four economic offences not involving the use of violence. Thus, Georgia became a first former Soviet republic to take steps to abolish the death penalty.

==== Foreign policy ====
During his rule, Gamsakhurdia maintained that Georgia would not sign New Union Treaty or interrepublican economic treaty. Georgia under Gamsakhurdia was among six Soviet republics, along with Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, and Armenia, that rejected the New Union Treaty in July 1991. Gamsakhurdia called for a boycott of the 1991 Soviet Union referendum on preserving the Union and the Georgia&#x27;s Supreme Council voted to do so. Gamsakhurdia remarked that &quot;the USSR law on referendum violates the sovereignty of the Republic of Georgia, because with this law the destiny of Georgia would be decided not by its citizens, but by citizens of all union republics in the Soviet Union&quot;. In response to the Soviet referendum, Georgia&#x27;s Supreme Council appointed the 1991 Georgian independence referendum. On 15 June 1991, in an interview to Saarländischer Rundfunk, Gamsakhurdia said that Georgia sought an eventual membership in the European Community and the United Nations, while it would develop relations with the USSR as a foreign state.

In response to the Soviet crackdown on the pro-independence movement in Lithuania in January 1991, Zviad Gamsakhurdia led a pro-Lithuania rally in Tbilisi, saying that &quot;it is impossible to preserve an empire by democratic means&quot; and urging the opposition to Kremlin.

On 31 March 1991, during the Georgian referendum, the American delegation led by Richard Nixon arrived to Georgia and met with Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The visit was unofficial, but it was still arranged by the US president George H. W. Bush. During the meeting, Gamsakhurdia said that &quot;there is no &quot;Soviet people&quot; but the nations conquered by the Soviet Union&quot;. Two weeks earlier, on 15 March, Gamsakhurdia met with James Baker in the US Embassy in Moscow. In an attempt to debunk the claim that &quot;Gorbachev&#x27;s Perestroika and democratic reforms would change situation in the Soviet Union&quot;, Gamsakhurdia said that they were just a façade &quot;to preserve the neocolonialism and the imperial structures&quot;. Gamsakhurdia said that he would believe that the Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms were real only if Gorbachev amended the USSR Law on Secession and made it more &quot;fair&quot;.

In an attempt to regulate the South Ossetia conflict, Gamsakhurdia met with Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR Boris Yeltsin in March 1991 in Kazbegi. At the negotiations, they agreed to establish a joint Russian-Georgian Joint Commission of Ministries of Internal Affairs to study the situation in the region, restore order and disarm the illegal groups.

On 6 and 7 April 1991, representatives of Armenia, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Moldova met in Chișinău, Moldova and pledged to cooperate in their independence efforts.

As Georgia was moving towards independence from the Soviet Union, the Georgian government, led by Zviad Gamsakhurdia, addressed Boris Yeltsin stating that &quot;After the fall of the Soviet Union, the only legitimate framework for relations between the Russian Federation and Georgia can be the treaty signed between Soviet Russia and the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Moscow on 7 May 1920&quot;. Under this treaty, Russia granted de jure recognition of Georgian independence in exchange for promising not to grant asylum on Georgian soil to troops of powers hostile to Bolshevik Russia. Moscow refused, and Georgia declared Soviet troops in Georgia an occupation force.

In July 1991, the Chairman of the Armenian Supreme Council Levon Ter-Petrosyan visited Tbilisi and met Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia.

On 3 July 1991, during a press conference, President Gamsakhurdia rejected that Georgia was considering a NATO membership.

In response to George H. W. Bush&#x27;s Chicken Kiev speech which supported Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and his New Union Treaty, the government of Georgia issued a statement declaring that &quot;the heir of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and others arrives ... and carries on propaganda in favor of the Union Treaty. Why didn&#x27;t he call on Kuwait to sign the Union Treaty with Iraq?&quot;.

Gamsakhurdia forged close ties with Chechnya, Russia&#x27;s breakaway republic. Gamsakhurdia met with Chechen leader Dzokhar Dudayev during the spring of 1991 in Kazbegi, the meeting being arranged by the leader of Adjarian Autonomous Republic Aslan Abashidze. Gamsakhurdia welcomed Chechnya&#x27;s declaration of independence in November 1991 and attended inauguration of Dzokhar Dudayev as Chechnya&#x27;s president in Grozny. While Chechnya did not receive backing from the international community, it received support and attention from Georgia, which became its only gateway to the outside world that was not controlled by Russia. As a sign of moral support, on 11 November 1991 Gamsakhurdia wrote a letter to the United Nations and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, condemning his declaration of the state of emergency in Chechnya amid its proclamation of sovereignty as &quot;a show of force against the Chechen people&quot;.

On 13 March 1992, the President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia, at the time removed from power as a result of the coup, while in Grozny, signed a decree recognizing the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. On 20 February 1992, Zviad Gamsakhurdia and Chechen President Dzokhar Dudayev signed join communique in Grozny. It called for the &quot;good will of the Caucasian peoples&quot; for the peaceful resolution all interethnic and interstate conflicts in the regions &quot;only at the negotiating table&quot;. The sides reached agreement on a number of topics, including &quot;the resolution of the disputed question of the return of Ingush lands only at the negotiating table and without the participation of a third side&quot; and &quot;the inviolability of historical borders, meaning South Ossetia, which must remain a part of Georgia&quot;. The document called Russia to play &quot;positive role&quot; in creating conditions for the normalizations of the Caucasus situation by withdrawing its troops from the territory as a &quot;first positive step in this direction&quot;. The communique emphasized the necessity of forming &quot;a pan-Caucasian home&quot;, the Union of Caucasian States.

=== Civil conflicts ===
==== South Ossetia ====
In 1989, violent unrest broke out between the Georgian independence-minded population of the region and Ossetians loyal to the Soviet Union in South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast. In September 1990 Ossetian nationalists in the South Ossetia&#x27;s regional soviet declared independence from Georgia by announcing &quot;South Ossetian Soviet Democratic Republic&quot; loyal to Moscow. In response, the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR annulled the autonomy of South Ossetia. Following clashes between Georgians and South Ossetians on 12 December 1990 Gamsakhurdia declared a state of emergency in the region.

==== Coup d&#x27;état ====

Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s rule began with heavy opposition from the National Congress. Although the Communist Party weakened significantly and was unable to make the shift from ruling party to opposition, the National Congress refused to recognize the legitimacy of the official elections and new government, continuing using the same methods they had been using against the Soviet rule — street demonstrations, rallies, hunger strikes etc.

During the 1991 Soviet coup attempt, the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Gamsakhurdia had agreed with the Soviet military that the Georgian National Guard would be disarmed, and on 23 August, he issued decrees abolishing the post of commander of the Georgian National Guard and redesignating its members as interior troops subordinate to the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs. In reality, the National Guard was already a part of the Ministry of the Interior, and Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s opponents, who claimed he was seeking to abolish it, were asked to produce documents they claimed they possessed which verified their claims, but did not do so. Gamsakhurdia always maintained he had no intention of disbanding the National Guard. In defiance of the alleged order of Gamskhurdia, the sacked National Guard commander Tengiz Kitovani led most of his troops out of Tbilisi on 24 August. By this time, however, the coup had clearly failed and Gamsakhurdia publicly congratulated Russia&#x27;s President Boris Yeltsin on his victory over the putschists.

The political tensions escalated in September, with daily rallies for and against the president in Tbilisi. Political unrest beset the country as the clashes erupted between the opposition and the government. The demonstrations demanding Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s resignation were joined by the rebel units of the National Guard. Both renegade members of the Georgian national guard and pro-Gamsakhurdia troops deployed armored personnel carriers and artillery in the city. The opposition ignored Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s call to disarm. The rebellious members of the National Guard captured the city television center in Tbilisi and clashed with the police near the central power station which left four people dead and four wounded.

Gamsakhurdia reacted angrily, accusing shadowy forces in Moscow of conspiring with his internal enemies against Georgia&#x27;s independence movement. In a rally in early September, he told his supporters: &quot;The infernal machinery of the Kremlin will not prevent us from becoming free... Having defeated the traitors, Georgia will achieve its ultimate freedom.&quot; He shut down an opposition newspaper, &quot;Molodiozh Gruzii,&quot; on the grounds that it had published open calls for a national rebellion. Giorgi Chanturia, whose National Democratic Party was one of the most active opposition groups at that time, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of seeking help from Moscow to overthrow the legal government. It was also reported that Channel 2, a television station, was closed down after employees took part in rallies against the government.

On 22 December 1991, armed opposition supporters launched a violent coup d&#x27;état and attacked a number of official buildings including the Georgian parliament building, where Gamsakhurdia himself was sheltering. Heavy fighting continued in Tbilisi until 6 January 1992, leaving hundreds dead and the centre of the city heavily damaged. On 6 January, Gamsakhurdia and members of his government escaped through opposition lines and made their way to Azerbaijan where they were denied asylum. Armenia finally hosted Gamsakhurdia for a short period and rejected Georgian demands to extradite Gamsakhurdia back to Georgia. In order not to complicate tense relations with Georgia, Armenian authorities allowed Gamsakhurdia to move to the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya, where he was granted asylum by the rebel government of General Dzhokhar Dudayev.

A Military Council made up of Gamsakhurdia opponents took over the government on an interim basis. One of its first actions was to remove Gamsakhurdia as president. Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s supporters continued to hold rallies to support the ousted President. The Military Council opened fire with automatic weapons to disperse protesters on several occasions, resulting in several deaths. The order to shoot was given by Jaba Ioseliani, the leader of Mkhedrioni paramilitary.

It was later claimed that Russian forces had been involved in the coup against Gamsakhurdia. On 15 December 1992 the Russian newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti printed a letter claiming that the former Vice-Commander of the Transcaucasian Military District, Colonel General Sufian Bepayev, had sent a &quot;subdivision&quot; to assist the armed opposition. If the intervention had not taken place, it was claimed, &quot;Gamsakhurdia supporters would have been guaranteed victory.&quot; It was also claimed that Soviet special forces had helped the opposition to attack the state television tower on 28 December.

The Military Council reconstituted itself as a State Council in March 1992 and, without any formal referendum or election, appointed Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s old rival Eduard Shevardnadze as chairman, who then ruled as &quot;de facto&quot; president until the formal restoration of the presidency in November 1995.

== In exile ==
After his overthrow, Gamsakhurdia continued to promote himself as the legitimate president of Georgia. He was still recognized as such by some governments and international organizations, although as a matter of pragmatic politics the insurrectionist Military Council was quickly accepted as the governing authority in the country. Gamsakhurdia himself refused to accept his ouster, not least because he had been elected to the post with an overwhelming majority of the popular vote (in conspicuous contrast to the undemocratically appointed Shevardnadze).

In November–December 1992, he was invited to Finland (by the Georgia Friendship Group of the Parliament of Finland) and Austria (by the International Society for Human Rights). In both countries, he held press conferences and meetings with parliamentarians and government officials

==Death==
On 31 December 1993, Zviad Gamsakhurdia died in circumstances that are still unclear. It is known that he died in the village of Dzveli Khibula in the Samegrelo region of western Georgia. Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s death was announced by the Georgian government on 5 January 1994. Some refused to believe that Gamsakhurdia had died at all but the question was eventually settled when his body was recovered on 15 February 1994. According to British press reports, his body was found with a single bullet wound to the head but, in fact, it was found with two bullet wounds to the head.

Years later Avtandil Ioseliani - counter-intelligence head of interim government - admitted that two special units were hunting Zviad on interim government&#x27;s orders.

In the first days of December 1993 two members of Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s personal guard also disappeared without a trace, after being sent on a scout mission. Some remains and ashes, never identified, were found 17 years later.

=== Theories ===
A variety of reasons has been given for Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s death, which is still controversial and remains unresolved. On 14 December 2018, Constantine and Tsotne Gamsakhurdia, the former president&#x27;s two sons, announced concerns about the expiration of the statute of limitations set at the end of the same year for a potential investigation into the death of their father, as Georgian law set a 25-year limit for serious crime investigations. They then announced the beginning of a hunger strike.

On 21 December, newly inaugurated President Salome Zurabishvili formally endorsed the request to expand the statute of limitations, a move supported by opposition and ruling party members of Parliament. Less than a week later, Parliament approved a bill to expand the statute of limitations for serious crimes from 25 to 30 years after the crime, following Constantine Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s hospitalization.

On 26 December, following the setting-up of a new investigative group under the leadership of General Prosecutor Shalva Tadumadze, promising a new investigation into Zviad Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s death, Tsotne Gamsakhurdia ended his hunger strike. However, the investigation failed to reach any conclusion to this day, with numerous theories about Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s death floating in public discourse.

==== Suicide ====
In January 1994, Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s widow Manana Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia told the Interfax news agency that her husband shot himself on 31 December after being surrounded by forces of the pro-Shevardnadze Mkhedrioni militia. The Russian media reported that his bodyguards heard a muffled shot in the next room and found that Gamsakhurdia had killed himself with a shot to the head from a Stechkin pistol. Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s press service in Grozny published what they claimed was Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s suicide note: &quot;Being in clear state of mind, I commit this act in token of protest against the ruling regime in Georgia and because I am deprived of the possibility, acting as the president, to normalize the situation, and to restore law and order.&quot;

==== Assassination ====
On 25 January 1994, Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s son Konstantine Gamsakhurdia told Le Monde that his father &quot;was murdered&quot;.

Despite initially claiming that her husband&#x27;s death was a suicide, in March 1995 his widow claimed in an interview to &quot;Trud&quot; newspaper that Gamsakhurdia was killed on orders from Eduard Shevardnadze, by his bodyguards who were together with him in hiding. She accused Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s finance minister Guram Abasnadze of masterminding his murder. She later alleged that Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s prime minister, Besarion Gugushvili ordered one of Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s bodyguards to kill him.

Several Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s guards claim that Gamsakhurdia committed suicide, but the family opposes this account of events and claims that Gamsakhurdia was killed. In 2007, BBC News reported that some of Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s friends believed he committed suicide, &quot;although his widow insists that he was murdered.&quot;

In 2001, fugitive former Georgian intelligence chief Igor Giorgadze accused Georgian special services of murdering Gamsakhurdia.

According to former deputy director of Biopreparat Ken Alibek, that laboratory was possibly involved in the design of an undetectable chemical or biological agent to assassinate Gamsakhurdia.

==== Died in infighting ====
According to another version circulated in early January 1994 by the Shevardnadze&#x27;s government, Gamsakhurdia was shot in a skirmish with his own allies following a quarrel. The Georgian news agency, citing a member of the Mkhedrioni paramilitary, reported that Gamsakhurdia died in Grozny after being wounded in a fight with his own associates. The Georgian Security Ministry stated that Gamsakhurdia was shot in Grozny on 30 December and died on 5 January. The Georgian officials reported that his widow was &quot;misinformed&quot; and that his suicide was a rumor. An aide of Georgian Security Minister David Mumladze said that they &quot;did not believe&quot; in Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s suicide. Mumladze even claimed that Gamsakhurdia could have been murdered by his supporters to &quot;turn him into a martyr&quot; and suggested that it could also be linked to him falling out with his former chief commander, Loti Kobalia.

Eduard Shevardnadze, after himself questioning Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s suicide, sent a group of investigators to Grozny. On 8 January 1994, they reported that Gamsakhurdia committed a suicide.

=== Burial ===

Gamsakhurdia was initially buried in the village of Dzveli Khibula and later re-buried in the village of Jikhashkari (also in the Samegrelo region). Eduard Shevardnadze sent investigators to identify his body. Chechen officials asked the government of Shevardnadze to allow Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s remains to be buried in his family&#x27;s cemetery next to his home in Tbilisi or, in case of refusal, to transfer his body to be buried in Chechnya. There were appeals to name a street in Grozny after Gamsakhurdia. In February 1994, Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s body was discovered by a joint commission from Georgia and Chechnya, which led to the Georgian government confirming Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s death. Georgian and Chechen officials agreed to have his body be flown to the Chechen capital Grozny, where his remains were buried. Dudayev provided state funeral and Orthodox Christian last rites to Gamsakhurdia. During his burial in Grozny in February 1994, Dudayev stated: &quot;We are gathered here today to give back to the earth a brave son of the Caucasus, a man who believed in freedom.&quot;

On 3 March 2007, the newly appointed president of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov announced that Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s grave – lost in the debris and chaos of a war-ravaged Grozny – had been found in the center of the city. Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s remains were identified by Russian experts in Rostov-on-Don, and arrived in Georgia on 28 March 2007, for reburial. He was interred alongside other prominent Georgians at the Mtatsminda Pantheon on 1 April 2007. Thousands of people throughout Georgia had arrived in Mtskheta&#x27;s medieval cathedral to pay tribute to Gamsakhurdia. &quot;We are implementing the decision which was [taken] in 2004 – to bury President Gamsakhurdia on his native soil. This is a fair and absolutely correct decision,&quot; President Mikheil Saakashvili told reporters according to the &quot;Civil Georgia&quot; internet news website.

==Personal life==
In addition to Georgian, Gamsakhurdia was fluent in Russian, French, English and German. He was a devout adherent of the Georgian Orthodox Church his entire life.

Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s second wife, Manana Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia, was the inaugural First Lady of independent Georgia. The couple had two sons, Tsotne and Giorgi.

Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s only son from his first marriage is Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, who became a politician and the leader of the Tavisupleba (&quot;Freedom&quot;) political party.

==Legacy==
On 26 January 2004, in a ceremony held at the Kashueti Church of Saint George in Tbilisi, the newly elected President Mikheil Saakashvili officially rehabilitated Gamsakhurdia to resolve the lingering political effects of his overthrow in an effort to &quot;put an end to disunity in our society&quot;, as Saakashvili put it. He praised Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s role as a &quot;great statesman and patriot&quot; and promulgated a decree granting permission for Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s body to be reburied in the Georgian capital, declaring that the &quot;abandon[ment of] the Georgian president&#x27;s grave in a war zone ... is a shame and disrespectful of one&#x27;s own self and disrespectful of one&#x27;s own nation&quot;. He also renamed a major road in Tbilisi after Gamsakhurdia and released 32 Gamsakhurdia supporters imprisoned by Shevardnadze&#x27;s government in 1993–1994, who were regarded by many Georgians and some international human rights organizations as being political prisoners. In 2013, Gamsakhurdia was posthumously awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia by President Mikheil Saakashvili. Along with Gamsakhurdia, the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia was also awarded to his fellow dissident and friend Merab Kostava. Saakashvili called Gamsakhurdia &quot;a leading light of the national idea&quot; who fought for his country&#x27;s freedom &quot;when no one could even image it&quot;. In parallel, in March 2005 the Parliament of Georgia passed resolution &quot;About the Legal Assessment of the Events of December–January 1991-92&quot;, which denounced the overthrow of Gamsakhurdia as an &quot;unconstitutional armed coup&quot;. Government officials as well as people pay tribute to memory of Zviad Gamsakhurdia every year on his birthday.
In 2014, the Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili announced a scholarship dedicated to Zviad Gamsakhurdia, awarded to an outstanding student studying historic literature.

In 2019, the plenary room of the Parliament of Georgia was named after Zviad Gamsakhurdia, with Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of Parliament, describing Gamsakhurdia as &quot;the symbol of our statehood&quot;.

The museum honoring the life of the Gamsakhurdia is located in the village of Dzveli Khibula, where Gamsakhurdia spent the last days of his life. On 3 August 2018, by order of the director of the National Agency for the Protection of Cultural Heritage of Georgia, the museum received the status of an immovable monument of cultural heritage.

Gamsakhurdia is acknowledged as a symbol of Georgian nationalism and Georgia&#x27;s national liberation in 1990s. According to the 2020 Caucasus Research Resource Centers poll, 81% of Georgians consider Gamsakhurdia to be a true Georgian patriot, while 76% think that the overthrow of Gamsakhurdia was a bad thing for Georgia. 50% consider that independence would not be possible without Gamsakhurdia. According to the Cambridge University study, Gamsakhurdia is seen as one of the main Georgian national heroes of the 20th century, while his arch enemy Eduard Shevardnadze is perceived as a villain. Gamsakhurdia was voted as the best Georgian president in the 2019 poll by the Edison Research.

==Writings==
Gamsakhurdia published important scientific works (including 4 monographs) on issues of Russian history, history of Georgian culture, history of Georgian literature, theology, and history of American poetry. He translated into Georgian language the works of William Shakespeare, Charles Baudelaire, Nikolai Gogol and others. He also wrote poems and fables, which have been published. In 1970, Zviad Gamsakhurdia became a member of the Writers&#x27; Union of Georgia, but later was expelled in 1977 for his anti-Soviet dissident activity. Gamsakhurdia was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Georgian National Academy of Sciences for his work &quot;The Language of the Forms of the Knight in a Lordly Skin&quot;.

<doc id="313338" wikidata="Q1152880" url="?curid=313338" title="Five kings of Wa">
<text>The were kings of ancient Japan (Wa) who sent envoys to China during the 5th century to strengthen the legitimacy of their claims to power by gaining the recognition of the Chinese emperor. Details about them are unknown. According to written records in China, their names were San (), Chin (), Sai (), Kō () and Bu ().

== Titles bestowed on the Kings of Wa ==
In general, five kings of Wa were bestowed the titles (&quot;Antō [Dai-]Shōgun, Wa-kokuō&quot;, [Grand] General of Antō, King of Wa). In the Southern Dynasties of China in this period, there were three ranks of General titles which were bestowed to the chiefs of the subject state (located in the East of China) who sent envoy to the emperor of the Dynasty. The highest general title was (&quot;Seitō Dai-Shōgun&quot;, Grand General conquering the East). The next high title was (&quot;Chintō Dai-Shōgun&quot;, Grand General appeasing the East). The third high title and the lowest among three was (&quot;Antō Dai-Shōgun&quot;, Grand General pacifying the East).

In the Song dynasty, the emperor bestowed (&quot;Grand General conquering the East&quot;) on the King of Goguryeo, and (&quot;Grand General appeasing the East&quot;) on the King of Baekje. However, the Song Emperor bestowed the third general title, (&quot;Grand General pacifying the East&quot;) on the King of Wa. There are interpretations on this fact that the King of Goguryeo stood in the highest rank, and the King of Wa stood in the lowest rank, while the King of Baekje stood between Goguryeo and Wa. But there are also other opinions against this interpretation. The difference of general ranks among the three states (Goguryo, Baekje, and Wa) was due to the order which each state had first sent envoy to the dynasty, and it cannot be said that the ranks of Goguryeo and Baekje were substantially higher than that of Wa. Sakamoto also points out the different view on these general titles.

== Chinese records and the bestowed titles on the kings of Wa ==
== Comparison with the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; ==

=== Lack of records - two interpretations ===
In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, there are no records about &quot;five Kings of Wa&quot;. The records that some Daiō (great kings) of the Yamato Kingship sent envoy to the emperors of the Chinese dynasty and received the titles do not exist at all. The names of the five Kings, San, Chin, Sai, Kō and Bu are not written in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; as well. On the other hand, the five Kings of Wa were clearly recorded in the history books in China. In order to explain this situation, two kinds of interpretations have been proposed and discussed.
# The five Kings of Wa and their diplomatic activities had really existed, but the formal history book, &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, intentionally omitted these facts. The reason might be the policy which Yamato kingship adopted since late sixth century. That is, Japan (Wa, Yamato) whould not be involved in the Chinese Sakuhō System. Japan would not be a subject state of the Empire of China. Crown Prince Shōtoku adovocated this policy. But in this interpretation, there was other problem why the Kings of Wa had called themselves as one kanji letter name such as San or Chin.
# The other interpretation is that the five Kings of Wa were not the King of the Yamato, but some local chiefs such as Kings of the Kyūshū dynasty. They disguised as the King of Yamato and sent envoys. This interpretation could explain the strange one letter name of the five Kings. Also, &quot;the Nihon Shoki&quot; did not omit the historical facts which Chinese source recorded.
The first interpretation is traditional and the major stream of history study of the ancient Japan. But in this view, the identification problems arise. Many disputes have taken place for centuries. Which &quot;King of Wa&quot; does correspond to which Emperor in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;.

=== Identification problems ===

As the name of kings recorded in Chinese history are very different from the names of Emperors in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the specification of which emperor was the one recorded is the subject of numerous disputes which have endured for centuries. Most contemporary historians assign the five Japanese kings to the following emperors (two possibilities are identified for the Kings San and Chin), mostly based on the individual features of their genealogies reported in the Chinese sources.

On the other hand, archeological evidence, such as the inscriptions on the Inariyama and Eta Funayama Sword, also supports the idea that Bu is an equivalent of Emperor Yūryaku, who was called &quot;Wakatakeru Ōkimi&quot; by his contemporaries.

*San : Emperor Nintoku or Emperor Richū
*Chin : Emperor Hanzei or Emperor Nintoku
*Sai : Emperor Ingyō
*Kō : Emperor Ankō
*Bu : Emperor Yūryaku

Since Bu is most likely to be Yūryaku, Kō, who is said to be Bu&#x27;s older brother, is likely to be an equivalent of Ankō, who is also noted in the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; as an elder brother to Yūryaku. However, the &quot;Book of Song&quot; records Kō as &quot;&quot;Crown Prince&quot; Kō&quot;; there is a possibility that he is not Ankō, but rather Prince Kinashi no Karu, who was a crown prince of Ingyō.

== Meanings of titles bestowed on the kings of Wa ==
In the age of the Song Dynasty and the Southern Dynasties, there were various titles for high officials and military lords of the empire. These titles were also bestowed on the monarchs of the subject States in the Sakuhō System.

The King of Wa was usually granted the two titles, &quot;(Grand) General Antō&quot; (, &quot;Antō (Dai) Shōgun&quot;) and &quot;King of Wa&quot; (, &quot;Wa-Kokuō&quot;). Some Kings of Wa, such as King Chin or King Bu, asked for titles of higher ranks. The Emperor of Chinese Dynasty bestowed some of them, but did not approve every title requested.

King Chin asked for the titles &quot;&quot; (&quot;Shijisetsu, Totoku, Wa, Baekje, Silla, Mimana, Shinkan, Bokan, Rokkoku-Shogunji, Antō-Dai-Shōgun, Wa-Kokuō&quot;). This contains the Five Titles.
# , &quot;Shijisetsu&quot; : Highest Rank Military Commander (General)
# , &quot;Totoku&quot; : Military Governor
# , &quot;Totoku - Region - Shogunji&quot; : Governor/Commander ruling all the military matters of the said Region (Region, State, Province, etc.)
# , &quot;Antō Dai-Shōgun&quot; : Grand General of Antō (Grand General pacifying the East)
# , &quot;Wa-Kokuō&quot; : King of Wa State
Therefore, ”&quot; means 1) Highest Rank Military General, 2) Governor ruling all the military matters of the Six States - Wa, Baekje, Silla, Mimana, Shinkan and Bokan, 3) Grand General pacifying the East, 4) King of Wa. The Song court did not approve the Title of (&quot;Totoku - Baekje - Shogunji&quot;). The Song did not approve that King Chin would hold the power of militarily ruling the State area of Baekje. (King Bu also asked this power - militarily ruling the Baekje State - but the Song did not approve his request either.)

King Bu asked the Title (&quot;Kaifu Gidō-Sanshi&quot;). This Title &quot;Kaifu Gidō-Sanshi&quot; is particularly high rank. The Emperor of Song did not approve, and instead bestowed the Titles &quot;&quot; (&quot;Shijisetsu, Totoku, Wa, Silla, Mimana, Kara (Gaya), Shinkan, Bokan, Rokkoku-Shogunji, Antō Dai-Shōgun, Wa-Kokuō&quot;). 
# &quot;Kaifu Gidō-Sanshi&quot; : Person whose Position is equivalent or corresponds to the &quot;Three Lords&quot; (Highest Ranking Officials in the old Imperial Chinese governments. That is, &quot;Jōshō (Shito)&quot;, &quot;Taii&quot;, &quot;Gyoshi-Taifu (Shikū)&quot;.

<text>Harry Leroy Halladay III (May 14, 1977 – November 7, 2017) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies between 1998 and 2013. His nickname, &quot;Doc&quot;, coined by Toronto Blue Jays announcer Tom Cheek, was a reference to Wild West gunslinger Doc Holliday. An eight-time All-Star, Halladay was one of the most dominant pitchers of his era and is regarded as one of the greatest pitchers of all time. His outstanding durability allowed him to lead the league in complete games seven times, the most of any pitcher whose career began after 1945. He also led the league in strikeout-to-walk ratio five times and innings pitched four times.

Raised in Arvada, Colorado, Halladay pitched at Arvada West High School before being drafted 17th overall by the Blue Jays in the 1995 MLB draft. He made his major league debut in 1998, nearly pitching a no-hitter in his second career start. After struggling in 2000, he was demoted to the low minor leagues, where he reworked his delivery and pitching. In 2002, Halladay established himself as a durable, elite starting pitcher, earning his first All-Star selection. The following year, he won the American League (AL) Cy Young Award and led the AL in complete games, which he accomplished five times in seven seasons, through 2009. Traded to the Phillies before the 2010 season, he pitched both the 20th perfect game and the second postseason no-hitter in major league history, led the majors in shutouts for the second consecutive year, and won the National League (NL) Cy Young Award. In 2011, Halladay had another dominant season, leading the NL in complete games, but he was plagued by injuries the next two years. After the 2013 season, he announced his retirement. 

On November 7, 2017, Halladay died when he crashed his ICON A5 amphibious plane into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida. He was 40 years old. The following year the Blue Jays organization retired his number 32; the Phillies retired his number 34 in 2021. In 2019, Halladay was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

==Early life==
Born in Denver, Colorado, Halladay grew up in the suburb of Arvada; his father, Harry Leroy Halladay II, was a pilot for a food-processing company, who began teaching his son to fly during the younger Halladay&#x27;s early childhood; his mother, Linda, was a homemaker. Halladay was raised a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, though he did not practice later in life.

From an early age, Halladay loved baseball, trying every position on the field until, by age 14, his success on the pitcher&#x27;s mound attracted the attention of major league scouts. By the age of 13, he had begun training with Colorado baseball guru Bus Campbell, who had helped almost every promising pitcher from the Denver area, including Goose Gossage and Brad Lidge.

Halladay attended Arvada West High School, where he led the school&#x27;s baseball team to a 6A state championship in 1994. In 1995, after graduating from high school, he was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the amateur draft, in the first round, as the 17th overall pick. Halladay decided to forego his college baseball commitment to Arizona and sign with Toronto. He was promoted to the major-league club as a September call-up in 1998.

==Career==
===Toronto Blue Jays (1998–2009)===
====1998–2001====
In his second career start, against the Detroit Tigers on September 27, 1998, Halladay had what would have been the third no-hitter ever pitched on the final day of a regular season broken up with two outs in the ninth. The feat would have joined the combined no-hitter by four Oakland Athletics pitchers (Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad, and Rollie Fingers) in 1975 and Mike Witt&#x27;s perfect game in 1984. The bid was broken up by pinch hitter Bobby Higginson&#x27;s solo home run, the only hit allowed in a Toronto victory, as Halladay recorded his first major Prior to the home run, the sole base runner had reached on an infield error in the fifth inning, as Halladay struck out eight and 

During the 2000 season, Halladay posted a 10.64 earned run average (ERA) in 19 games, 13 of which he started, making his 2000 season the worst in history for any pitcher with at least 50 innings pitched. At the beginning of the 2001 season, Halladay was optioned to Class-A Dunedin to rebuild his delivery. Halladay&#x27;s fastball was clocked as high as , but it had little movement, and his pitches were up in the strike zone, which was ultimately the reason why his 2000 season was so unsuccessful. He considered quitting baseball. Instead, he worked in the minors with former Blue Jays pitching coach Mel Queen. The problem, Queen realized, was Halladay&#x27;s total reliance on his strength: his attempt to overpower batters with straight-ahead pitches. Within two weeks, Halladay had altered his arm angle for a more deceptive delivery, and added pitches that sank and careened. Instead of throwing over the top, he chose to use a three-quarters delivery (the middle point between throwing overhand and sidearm). Originally a fastball pitcher, he became reliant on keeping his pitches low across the plate, regardless of the type of pitch thrown. The adjustments proved successful. After a month and a half, he was promoted to Double-A Tennessee, and a month later, to Triple-A Syracuse. By mid-season, he was back in the Blue Jays&#x27; rotation. He posted a 5–3 win–loss record with a 3.19 ERA for the Blue Jays in 16 starts in 2001.

====2002–2006====
In 2001, after being demoted to the minor leagues, Halladay immersed himself in the works of sports psychologist Harvey Dorfman. This exposure was at least partly responsible for resurrecting his career. In 2002, Halladay had a breakout season, finishing with a 19–7 record, while posting a 2.93 ERA with 168 strikeouts in 239.1 innings. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star team. Halladay continued his success in the 2003 season, posting a 22–7 record with a 3.25 ERA in 266 innings. He also recorded 204 strikeouts and only 32 walks, good for a 6.38 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Halladay pitched the first extra-inning shutout in the major leagues since Jack Morris in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, leading the Blue Jays to victory over the Tigers on September 6. He pitched 10 innings and had not allowed a hit until Kevin Witt doubled with two outs in the top of the eighth. Halladay won the American League Cy Young Award, while being once again named an All-Star and leading the Blue Jays to a surprising 86 victories. He was named by his peers as the &quot;Players Choice Awards&quot; AL Outstanding Pitcher. He was also named the &quot;Sporting News&quot; AL Pitcher of the Year and the &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; Internet Baseball Awards AL Cy Young Award winner.

In 2004, Halladay was placed on the disabled list twice due to right shoulder problems. In 133.0 innings, he went 8–8 with a 4.20 ERA. He walked 39 batters, seven more than he had walked in 2003 when he had pitched twice as many innings. He later revealed that he had been injured throughout the entire season with a &quot;tired throwing arm&quot;, which he believed was from intense workouts in the preseason.

The 2005 season began successfully for Halladay, as he posted a 12–4 record with a 2.41 ERA in 19 starts. He was selected to his third All-Star team and was slated to be the starting pitcher for the American League at the All-Star Game in Detroit. However, on July 8, Halladay&#x27;s leg was broken by a line drive off the bat of Texas Rangers left fielder Kevin Mench. As a result, he was replaced in the All-Star Game by Matt Clement of the Boston Red Sox, while Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox was named the starting pitcher for the American League. Despite rehabilitation of his leg, Halladay would sit out the remainder of the season. On March 16, 2006, Halladay signed a three-year, $40 million contract extension through 2010. During that year, Halladay finished near the top of MLB in wins with 16. He was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve on July 3, along with four of his Blue Jays teammates. It marked the second-most appearances in club history, and Halladay&#x27;s fourth as an All-Star. Although Halladay&#x27;s strikeout total was lower in 2006 than in previous seasons, his ground ball/fly ball ratio, complete games, and innings pitched were all among the American League leaders.

====2007–2009====
Halladay was the American League pitcher of the month in April 2007, going 4–0, highlighted by a 10-inning complete-game win over the Detroit Tigers. However, he pitched poorly in his two starts in May, and on May 11 was placed on the disabled list and underwent an appendectomy. He returned to the rotation in his usual form on May 31 against the Chicago White Sox. Halladay went seven innings, giving up just six hits and allowing no runs on his way to his 100th career win. 2007 also saw Halladay hit his first career RBI. Against the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 10, his ground ball single to center field allowed John McDonald to score. He shut out the Seattle Mariners on July 22, allowing only three hits.

In 2008, for the sixth consecutive year, Halladay was Toronto&#x27;s opening-day starter, improving his own club record. He lost 3–2 to the New York Yankees, in a pitcher&#x27;s duel with Chien-Ming Wang. His first win of the season came in his next start, against Boston, when he outpitched Josh Beckett.

In his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the Texas Rangers, in a 4–1 win. Three of his nine complete-game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto&#x27;s underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete-game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he was struck in the temple by a line drive off the bat of Nyjer Morgan. The ball caromed off Halladay&#x27;s head and was caught by third baseman Scott Rolen, ending the inning. Halladay was able to walk back to the dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given a clean bill of health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career shutout against the Seattle Mariners on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals&#x27; Mark Mulder for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his seventh complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing no runs on two hits for his 11th career shutout. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding one hit, and striking out Lance Berkman. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees, earning his 20th win of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since Luis Tiant in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 WHIP. Halladay finished second in the American League Cy Young Award voting, behind Cliff Lee of Cleveland. He also led the AL with nine complete games, and struck out a career-high 206 batters (two more than his 2003 season) as well as posting a 2.78 ERA (the second-best of his career) that was second only to Cliff Lee&#x27;s 2.54 ERA. Halladay also became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post two seasons of 200 strikeouts and fewer than 40 walks. He was presented the George Gross/Toronto Sun Sportsperson of the Year award.

On April 6, 2009, Halladay made his team-record seventh straight Opening Day start for Toronto, defeating the Detroit Tigers. Halladay then also won his next two starts, on the road against Cleveland and Minnesota. Halladay lost his next game to Texas, giving up five earned runs over eight innings. He then rang up victories in his next six starts, giving him an 8–1 record with a 2.75 ERA. With season-ending injuries to planned 2009 Jays&#x27; starters Dustin McGowan and Shawn Marcum, and with #2 starter Jesse Litsch on the disabled list early in the season, Halladay led a staff of young, mostly inexperienced starters. He was named the AL Player of the Week for the period ending May 17, having gone 2–0 with a 1.13 ERA over 16.0 innings in his two starts that week. In a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on June 2, Halladay struck out 14 batters and threw 133 pitches, both career highs. On June 12, he left the game early because of a strained hip adductor muscle, commonly referred to as a &quot;pulled groin&quot;, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 17. On July 5, he was selected to represent Toronto at the All-Star Game. On July 14, he started the All-Star Game for the American League, pitching two innings and giving up three runs, of which one was unearned. That year, he was named #7 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27;s list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.

As of the conclusion of his start on September 20, 2009, Halladay was tied for the second-longest streak in the American League that season with a 24-inning scoreless streak. Halladay finished the season with a 17–10 record, giving him a career win percentage of .660, good enough for 18th all-time. In December, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Halladay as one of the five pitchers in the starting rotation of its MLB All-Decade Team.

===Philadelphia Phillies (2010–2013)===
On December 15, 2009, the Blue Jays traded Halladay to the Philadelphia Phillies for minor league prospects Travis d&#x27;Arnaud, Kyle Drabek, and Michael Taylor. He agreed to a contract extension worth US$60 million, which included a US$20 million vesting option for a fourth season. Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. had unsuccessfully attempted to get Halladay at the non-waiver trade deadline in July 2009, then traded for Cliff Lee instead. Three hours before Halladay signed the contract extension, Amaro traded away Lee, to the surprise of Halladay, who thought that Lee would be his teammate. In fact, the Phillies&#x27; acquisition of Halladay and trade of Lee were deeply intertwined, as the team wanted to strengthen the rotation without emptying the farm system of prospects. They traded several prospects for Halladay, then refreshed the system with the return haul for Lee.

====2010====

On Opening Day, Halladay pitched seven innings while giving up a run against the Washington Nationals in his first game with the Phillies. He had nine strikeouts and allowed six hits. He also drove in his second career RBI and earned his first win of the season. He followed this start with a complete game on April 11 against the Houston Astros, giving up one unearned run while striking out eight and not giving up any walks in the Phillies&#x27; 2–1 victory.

Halladay pitched his first shutout in the National League, against the Atlanta Braves on April 21, becoming the first pitcher to reach four wins in the 2010 season. On May 1, Halladay pitched his second shutout of the season, limiting the New York Mets to three hits and striking out six.

On September 21, Halladay became the first Phillies pitcher to win 20 games in a season since Steve Carlton accomplished it in 1982. He was the first right-handed Phillies pitcher to accomplish the feat since Robin Roberts in 1955. One week later, on September 27, he completed his 21st victory, helping the Phillies clinch their fourth consecutive National League East title, and the Phillies finished with the best regular-season record in MLB.

Halladay made his first postseason start in Game 1 of the National League Division Series, as the Phillies squared off against the Cincinnati Reds. Halladay threw a no-hitter, giving up only one walk (to Jay Bruce in the fifth inning) in a 4–0 victory where he threw 104 pitches. Halladay&#x27;s was only the second postseason no-hitter in Major League Baseball history, and the first since Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in the 1956 World Series. Halladay became the first pitcher in Major League history to throw a perfect game and another no-hitter in the same calendar year (including the postseason).

The Phillies swept the Reds in three games to advance to their third consecutive National League Championship Series, where they faced the San Francisco Giants. Halladay started Games 1 and 5, which were one of the most touted postseason pitching match-ups in recent history as he faced another former Cy Young winner in both games, Tim Lincecum. Halladay lost Game 1, 4–3, and won Game 5, 4–2, as the Phillies were eliminated in six games by the Giants, who went on to win the World Series. In Game 5, Halladay pulled his groin after the first inning but continued for six more innings to help his team stave off elimination.

Halladay was named by his peers as the &quot;Players Choice Awards&quot; NL Outstanding Pitcher. He was also unanimously chosen as the recipient of the 2010 National League Cy Young Award, becoming the first Phillie to win the award since Steve Bedrosian in 1987 and only the fifth pitcher in MLB history to win the award in both leagues, joining Gaylord Perry, Pedro Martínez, Randy Johnson and Roger Clemens. He was likewise selected as the &quot;Sporting News&quot; NL Pitcher of the Year, the &quot;USA Today&quot; NL Cy Young, the &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; Internet Baseball Awards NL Cy Young, and the winner of the NLBM Wilbur &quot;Bullet&quot; Rogan Legacy Award (NL Pitcher of the Year). He also was named the MLB &quot;This Year in Baseball Awards&quot; Starting Pitcher of the Year. &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; named him its Pitcher of the Year (including both leagues). &quot;Baseball America&quot; named him its Major League Player of the Year (including all positions in both leagues). MLB named him its &quot;MLB Clutch Performer of the Year&quot;. He was given the Heart &amp; Hustle Award by the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association. He was also named Pro Athlete of the Year by both the &quot;Sporting News&quot; and the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association and Sportsperson of the Year by the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;. The Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America presented him with the &quot;Steve Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher&quot; and &quot;Dallas Green Special Achievement&quot; awards.

In innings pitched, Halladay finished the 2010 regular season with a 21–10 record and a 2.44 ERA, setting a career high with 219 strikeouts while issuing just 30 walks. He led the National League in wins, innings pitched, and complete games (9), including four shutouts. He became just the seventh pitcher in the history of Major League baseball to pitch 250 or more innings with 30 or fewer walks, the first pitcher to do so since Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1923 with the Chicago Cubs.

====Perfect game====

On May 29, 2010, Halladay pitched the 20th perfect game in MLB history against the Florida Marlins in Miami, retiring all 27 batters and striking out 11, allowing no hits, runs, walks, or errors. This was the first time in the modern era that two pitchers (along with Dallas Braden of the Oakland A&#x27;s) had thrown perfect games in the same month and that multiple perfect games had been achieved in the same season.

On August 24, 2010, to commemorate his perfect game, Halladay presented around 60 Swiss-made Baume and Mercier watches he had purchased to everyone in the clubhouse. The watches were presented in brown boxes that bore the inscription: &quot;We did it together. Thanks, Roy Halladay.&quot; Additionally, the back of each watch was engraved with the date of the game, the line score, and the individual recipient&#x27;s name.

====Postseason no-hitter====

On October 6, 2010, in his first postseason appearance, Halladay pitched a no-hitter (his second of the season), against the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of the National League Division Series (NLDS).

He became the second player to pitch a no-hitter in the postseason, joining Don Larsen of the New York Yankees, who pitched a perfect game in the 1956 World Series. He also became the first pitcher since Nolan Ryan in 1973 to throw two no-hitters in a season, as well as the seventh pitcher to hurl both a perfect game and a regular no-hitter in his career, joining Cy Young, Addie Joss, Jim Bunning, Sandy Koufax, Randy Johnson, and Mark Buehrle. Halladay allowed just one walk to right fielder Jay Bruce with two outs in the fifth inning, and faced just one batter above the minimum.

This also marked the first time in Major League history that a pitcher threw a perfect game and another no-hitter in the same calendar year (including the postseason). The fans voted his no-hitter as the &quot;This Year in Baseball Awards&quot; Postseason Moment of the Year.

====2011====
For the 2011 season, Halladay was joined by Cliff Lee, who before the 2010 season had been traded away from the Phillies shortly before Halladay joined. The resulting starting pitching lineup of Halladay, Lee, Cole Hamels, Roy Oswalt and Joe Blanton had commentators dub it one of the best rotations ever assembled. Halladay, Oswalt, Lee, and Hamels were dubbed the &#x27;&quot;Phantastic Phour&quot;&#x27; by fans and the media.

On April 24, 2011, Halladay struck out 14 and allowed just five hits in the game as his team swept the San Diego Padres in all four games. Halladay took a two-hitter into the ninth before allowing three straight singles. He allowed just one run and won, 3–1.

In May, Halladay was named the 2011 winner of the John Wanamaker Athletic Award, by the Philadelphia Sports Congress, based on his 2010 season. In June, Halladay was presented the Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award for his performance since June 2010. He also took home the Best Moment ESPY Award for his postseason no-hitter in October 2010.

On July 12, Halladay was the NL starting pitcher in the All-Star Game. Halladay went 19–6 in 2011, with a 2.35 ERA, and pitched eight complete games, second-most in the Majors. The Phillies won their fifth consecutive National League East championship, and also finished with the best record in baseball for the second straight year.

Halladay was named the starter for Games 1 and 5 during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game 1, 11–6, but lost Game 5, 1–0, in a duel with former Blue Jays teammate and close friend Chris Carpenter. Halladay had pitched Game 5 despite having back pain. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and it would turn out to be Halladay&#x27;s final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said &quot;I think the one thing I took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is nothing you can do about that.&quot;

Halladay finished second in the NL Cy Young voting to Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was selected as one of the three starting pitchers on the &quot;MLB Insiders Club Magazine&quot; All-Postseason Team.

In December, Halladay was named the Sportsperson of the Year by the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; for the second consecutive year.

====2012====
On April 5, 2012, Halladay threw eight innings of shutout ball against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Opening Day, giving up two hits while striking out five.

On May 29, Halladay was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a shoulder strain. It was his first DL stint since 2009. In a press conference on June 6, Halladay stated, &quot;Ultimately, my goal is to finish my career with the Phillies and win a World Series here. Some of those things are not fully in my control, but my intent is to play here and finish my career here and be here as long as I can.&quot; Halladay stated this during his press conference about his shoulder injury, and he revealed that he would sit out three more weeks, and then re-evaluate his condition. The injury would eventually be diagnosed as a strained latissimus dorsi and Halladay was hopeful he would be able to return shortly after the All-Star break in July.

On July 17, Halladay came off the DL and was the starting pitcher against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched five innings, giving up five hits and two earned runs while fanning six in a no-decision which the Phillies would go on to win, 3–2.

In a loss against the Atlanta Braves on July 29, Halladay recorded his 2,000th strikeout to become the 67th pitcher in MLB history to reach the milestone.

Although Halladay was on the DL and had the worst ERA since first starting off his career, he still remained above .500 going 11–8.

====2013====
After struggling in spring training, Halladay gave up five runs in his first start in the Phillies second game on April 3, 2013, striking out nine in innings pitched. After struggling in his prior starts, Halladay pitched eight innings allowing just one run on April 14, 2013, against the Miami Marlins whom the Phillies defeated 2–1. Halladay recorded his 200th career win in the game.

On May 5, Halladay gave up nine earned runs in just innings. The next day, Halladay was placed on the disabled list with a right shoulder injury. On May 8, it was announced that he would have surgery on his shoulder to have a bone spur removed. The surgery was also to address fraying of his glenoid labrum and rotator cuff. Though he was initially supposed to be making a rehab start in Double-A for the Reading Fightin&#x27; Phils that day, an 18-inning game the previous night caused the Phillies to have a shortage of pitchers and as such, Halladay returned to the major leagues on August 25 for a start against the Arizona Diamondbacks in which he threw six innings, allowing two runs on four hits with two walks and two strikeouts. He finished the season with a 6.82 ERA, his worst since 2000, and a 4–5 record in 13 starts.

===Retirement===

On December 9, 2013, Halladay signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the Blue Jays and announced his retirement from baseball due to injury. At his press conference, Halladay listed a persistent back injury, as well as wanting to be more involved with his family, as his reasons for retiring.

Although retired as a player, Halladay continued to be a part of the game as a guest instructor for the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays. The Phillies hired Halladay as a &quot;mental skills coach&quot; in March 2017. Halladay also volunteered as a baseball coach at Calvary Christian High School in Clearwater, Florida where his oldest son played baseball.

==Approach to pitching==

Halladay&#x27;s distinctiveness was characterized by his ability to throw a hard two-seam sinking fastball ranging in the low 90s with pinpoint control. In addition, he threw a four-seam fastball in the low 90s, a curveball in the high 70s, and cut fastball from 90 to 92 mph for which he had modified his grip in 2007 at the suggestion of former catcher Sal Fasano. Halladay threw the hardest cutter among MLB starters in the 2011 season, at an average of 91.4 mph. The changeup was one pitch that Halladay had problems commanding for many years, and which he used very rarely. However, after joining the Phillies in 2010, Halladay started throwing a changeup that was a variation of the split-finger fastball (called a split-changeup). The pitch was introduced to Halladay by pitching coach Rich Dubee.

Despite his reputation as a ground ball pitcher who worked at an efficient pace, Halladay&#x27;s strikeout totals increased steadily in the few final years of his career. Halladay&#x27;s efficiency and durability were reflected in his total innings pitched every year, also due to his ability to strike out hitters and induce ground ball outs to escape jams. He often led the league in innings pitched and complete games, while ranking among the leaders in WHIP and ERA.

Prior to and during each start, Halladay had a distinct trademark in which he went into a complete &quot;isolation mode,&quot; immersing himself in complete concentration in order to plan every pitch he would throw while on the mound. During this time, he would not talk to anyone except the manager or the pitching coach. He would not even reply to a &quot;hello&quot; or wave from a teammate or spectator, nor talk to the media until he had been relieved or completed the game.

==Personal life==
Halladay had two children, Braden and Ryan, with his wife, Brandy (née Gates). During the offseason, Halladay lived with his family in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Halladay&#x27;s older son, Braden, committed to play baseball at Penn State shortly after Halladay&#x27;s death. Braden, who was born in Toronto, was invited to Baseball Canada&#x27;s U18 spring training camp on March 6, 2018, and pitched a scoreless inning in the Canadian Junior team&#x27;s exhibition game against the Blue Jays on March 17. In the 2019 MLB draft, as a tribute to Halladay, Braden was selected by the Blue Jays in the 32nd round.

While he was a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, Halladay and his wife invited children and their families from the Hospital for Sick Children into &quot;Doc&#x27;s Box&quot; at Rogers Centre during Blue Jays games. The remodeling of the suite to be more kid-friendly was documented in an episode of &quot;Design Inc.&quot; As part of Halladay&#x27;s contract with the Blue Jays, he also donated $100,000 each year to the Jays Care Foundation.

Halladay was the Blue Jays&#x27; nominee numerous times for the Roberto Clemente Award for his work with underprivileged children. For the same reason, he was also the Blue Jays&#x27; nominee in 2008 for the &quot;Players Choice Awards&quot; Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award.

Halladay was the cover athlete for &quot;Major League Baseball 2K11&quot;.

==Death==
On November 7, 2017, Halladay died when the ICON A5 Founders Edition amphibious aircraft he was piloting crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. The Pasco County, Florida, Sheriff&#x27;s Office confirmed that Halladay was the only occupant of the aircraft at the time of the crash and that air traffic controllers had not received any mayday distress signals from the plane before the crash. The crash was reported to have happened about off the coast of New Port Richey, Florida, in water deep.

The Pasco Sheriff&#x27;s Office Marine Unit responded to the accident after a call at noon, reporting that a sport plane had crashed upside-down into shallow water. The plane was reported to be Halladay&#x27;s, and he had tweeted four weeks earlier about his excitement about acquiring the plane, which was reportedly registered in the name of Halladay&#x27;s father, a retired commercial pilot.

An autopsy report by the Pinellas-Pasco Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office released in January 2018 revealed that Halladay&#x27;s blood contained morphine, hydromorphone, amphetamine, fluoxetine (an antidepressant), baclofen (a muscle relaxant), and zolpidem (a sleep aid sold under the brand name Ambien). According to forensic pathologist Burr Hartman, &quot;He had a drug combination similar to a speedball. He was impaired by these drugs. It was definitely not safe for him to fly an airplane.&quot; On April 15, 2020, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a report stating that in addition to the drugs, Halladay was executing aerobatics including steep climbs and turns, and the plane sometimes came within of the water before a final climb caused its speed to fall to , after which it nosedived into the sea and Halladay was killed by blunt force trauma and drowning. The NTSB determined the probable cause of the crash to be the &quot;pilot&#x27;s improper decision to perform aggressive, low-altitude maneuvers due to his impairment from the use of multiple psychoactive substances, which resulted in a loss of control&quot;.

Halladay and his wife, Brandy, appeared in a since-removed promotional video for the aircraft with her stating her strong objections to him buying the plane.

==Legacy==

In late 2017, the Phillies announced that use of uniform number 34 would be suspended for the 2018 season to honor Halladay. The Toronto Blue Jays retired Halladay&#x27;s number 32 during a pregame ceremony on Opening Day of the 2018 season. 

Halladay was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2017 and the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on January 22, 2019 in his first year of eligibility, garnering 85.41% of the vote. His wife and sons announced that they did not choose a logo for his cap, which leaves Roberto Alomar as the sole Cooperstown inductee as a Blue Jay. However, Halladay had said that, if given the choice, he wanted to be inducted as a Blue Jay.

On March 2, 2019, Phillies free-agent acquisition Bryce Harper, who wore uniform number 34 from his debut with the Washington Nationals in 2012, announced that he would not wear the number 34 as a member of the Phillies, stating that &quot;Roy Halladay should be the last one to wear it&quot; for the Phillies. Harper chose to wear number 3 instead.

On February 4, 2020, the Phillies announced they would retire Halladay&#x27;s number 34 on May 29, 2020, the tenth anniversary of his perfect game. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number retirement was postponed. The Phillies instead retired Halladay&#x27;s number during a pregame ceremony on August 8, 2021. At the ceremony, his former teammates Carlos Ruiz and Raul Ibanez were in attendance, along with his former manager Charlie Manuel. Steve Carlton, a fellow Hall of Fame pitcher for the Phillies, unveiled Halladay&#x27;s number 34 display at the stadium. In the Phillies game that day, Phillies pitcher Zack Wheeler pitched a two-hit, complete game shutout in a 3–0 victory against the New York Mets, and became the first Phillies pitcher to retire 22 consecutive batters in a game since Halladay himself did so during his perfect game in 2010. When asked about Halladay after the game, Wheeler responded: &quot;Today was his day, and I just tried to pitch like him.&quot;

On May 14, 2021, on what would&#x27;ve been Halladay&#x27;s 44th birthday, Jays Care Foundation announced the naming of Toronto&#x27;s first accessible baseball diamond as Roy Halladay Field. Located at Highview Park in the Birch Cliff neighborhood of Scarborough, Roy Halladay Field is used by athletes in Jays Care&#x27;s Challenger Baseball program, an adaptive baseball program for Canadian kids living with cognitive and/or physical disabilities.
