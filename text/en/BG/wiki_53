<text>Edward Jerningham Wakefield (25 June 1820 – 3 March 1879), known as Jerningham Wakefield, was the only son of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. As such, he was closely associated with his father&#x27;s interest in colonisation. He worked for the New Zealand Company and later was a member of the Canterbury Association. He was active as a politician in New Zealand, both at national and provincial level, but became an alcoholic and died penniless in an old people&#x27;s home.

==Early life==

Wakefield was born in London in 1820. His parents were Edward Gibbon Wakefield and Eliza Anne Frances Pattle, but his mother died within days of his birth. Together with his sister Nina, he was mostly brought up by Catherine Torlesse, his father&#x27;s sister and mother of Charles Torlesse. Wakefield was known by his middle name and educated at Bruce Castle School and King&#x27;s College London.

==Later life==

In 1839 he accompanied his uncle, Colonel William Wakefield to New Zealand on the New Zealand Company ship &quot;Tory&quot;. This expedition was an advance party seeking a suitable site to found a colony in the Cook Strait area. In 1840 he explored the coast from Wellington to Whanganui River guided by a group of Maori he referred to as his &quot;slaves&quot;.

Jerningham Wakefield had intended to stay in New Zealand for only a few months but he found the growth of the new colony so fascinating that it was four years before he returned to England in 1844. He quickly assembled his journals and they were published as &quot;Adventure in New Zealand&quot; in April 1845. The favourable picture he presented of the colony founded by the New Zealand Company helped the company to avoid censure in the House of Commons.

For the next five years Jerningham Wakefield lived a dissipated life in London. In September 1845 he attended a lecture at the Royal Adelaide Gallery in London by the tattooed Pākehā Māori, Barnet Burns, who had previously applied without success to join the New Zealand Company on the &quot;Tory&quot;. He joined the Canterbury Association on 6 May 1848, but resigned again on 8 November 1849. Then, in 1850, faced with bankruptcy, Wakefield sailed for New Zealand, this time with the advance party for the Canterbury settlement.


He entered politics, in New Zealand&#x27;s 1st Parliament, as one of the two members for Christchurch Country for 1853–1855; and was a member of the 5th Parliament for Christchurch City East for 1871–1875. He moved to Wellington in 1855 to be near his sick father, and represented the City of Wellington in the Provincial Council from 1857 to 1861.

He stood in the 1875 election in the electorate, where six candidates were contesting three available positions, but he came fifth and was thus defeated.

He had a financial interest in the earliest daily newspapers.

Because of his increasing alcoholism his behaviour was very erratic and he was an embarrassment to his supporters. He was one of the MPs sometimes locked in small rooms at Parliament by Whips to keep them sober enough to vote in critical divisions, though in 1872 this was defeated when political opponents lowered a bottle of whisky down the chimney to him. Gradually over the next few years he dissipated his wealth and substance and destroyed his health.

He died, penniless, in Ashburton, New Zealand in 1879.

<text>Kava Kava is an English rock band/live dance act from Huddersfield, England featuring the vocals, production, and songwriting of Pat Fulgoni.

They started as a four-piece live psychedelic funk outfit with heavy George Clinton influences with Pat Fulgoni on vocals, keyboards, and brass, Jason Riley on bass, Mathew Bond on guitar, and Chris Sykes on drums. In the U.K., Kava Kava cut their teeth through the underground festival/party scene, signing to Delerium Records and touring Europe and the U.K. amongst other artists signed to the label including Porcupine Tree and indie band Embrace. The &quot;NME&quot; describing the band as &quot;gorgeous new psychedelic funk&quot; for their debut album &quot;You Can Live Here&quot;.

The band expanded into a six-piece and released 2004&#x27;s &quot;Maui&quot; album on independent label Chocolate Fireguard Records. The music on &quot;Maui&quot; is more dance, electronic, funk, and disco influenced than their past work. They have notched up tours of the United States, China, and all over Europe, including Glastonbury Festival, Sziget Festival, SXSW Festival, Marktrock Festival, Trutnov Open Air Music Festival, and the Midi Modern Music Festival. Their music has been featured in a number of films and TV shows including &quot;Dirt&quot;, &quot;The Boys &amp; Girls Guide to Getting Down&quot;, &quot;John from Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Sex Wars&quot;, &quot;LA Riding Club&quot;, and the Golden Globe award–winning TV series &quot;Weeds&quot; and played by tastemaker DJs such as Sat Bisla and Nic Harcourt from KCRW. Pat Fulgoni continues to write music and tour as Kava Kava whilst collaborating with numerous other artists including many dance music artists signed to Hospital Records, Shogun Audio, Spearhead Records, and Viper Recordings, and from time to time, organises opportunities for bands (for example, the all Yorkshire showcases at the British Music Embassy venue SXSW).

Kava Kava continues gigging with their current line-up of Pat Fulgoni (vocals), Ben Wallbanks (drums), Alex Krzesinski (guitars), Rob Crisp and Ian Bailey (saxophone), and Mitch Cockman (bass)

<doc id="315341" wikidata="Q6194437" url="?curid=315341" title="Swashbuckler">
<text>A swashbuckler is a genre of European adventure literature that focuses on a heroic protagonist stock character who is skilled in swordsmanship, acrobatics, and guile, and possesses chivalrous ideals. A &quot;swashbuckler&quot; protagonist is heroic, daring, and idealistic: he rescues damsels in distress, protects the downtrodden, and uses duels to defend his honor or that of a lady or to avenge a comrade.

Swashbucklers often engage in daring and romantic adventures with bravado or flamboyance. Swashbuckler heroes are typically gentleman adventurers who dress elegantly and flamboyantly in coats, waistcoats, tight breeches, large feathered hats, and high leather boots, and they are armed with the thin rapiers that were commonly used by aristocrats.

Swashbucklers are not usually unrepentant brigands or pirates, although some may rise from such disreputable stations and achieve redemption. His opponent is typically characterized as a dastardly villain. While the hero may face down a number of henchmen to the villain during a story, the climax is a dramatic one-on-one sword battle between the protagonist and the villain. There is a long list of swashbucklers who combine courage, skill, resourcefulness, and a distinctive sense of honor and justice, as for example &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, Robin Hood, and Zorro.

As a historical fiction genre, it is often set in the Renaissance or Cavalier era. The stock character also became common in the film genre, which extended the genre to the Golden Age of Piracy. As swashbuckler stories are often mixed with the romance genre, there will often be a beautiful, aristocratic female love interest to whom the hero expresses a refined, courtly love. At the same time, since swashbuckler plots are often based on intrigues involving corrupt religious figures or scheming monarchs, the heroes may be tempted by alluring femmes fatales or vampish courtesans.

==Etymology==
&quot;Swashbuckler&quot; is a compound of &quot;swash&quot; (archaic: to swagger with a drawn sword) and &quot;buckler&quot; (a small shield gripped in the fist) dating from the 16th century.

==Historical background==
While man-at-arms and sellswords of the era usually wore armor of necessity, their counterparts in later romantic literature and film (see below) often did not, and the term evolved to denote a daring, devil-may-care demeanor rather than brandishment of accoutrements of war. Swashbuckling adventures and romances are generally set in Europe from the late Renaissance up through the Age of Reason and the Napoleonic Wars, extending into the colonial era with pirate tales in the Caribbean.

===Literature===
Jeffrey Richards traces the swashbuckling novel to the rise of Romanticism, and an outgrowth of the historical novel, particularly those of Sir Walter Scott, &quot;... medieval tales of chivalry, love and adventure rediscovered in the eighteenth century&quot;. This type of historical novel was further developed by Alexandre Dumas.

John Galsworthy said of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1888 swashbuckling romance, &quot;The Black Arrow&quot;, that it was &quot;a livelier picture of medieval times than I remember elsewhere in fiction.&quot; Anthony Hope&#x27;s 1894 &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; initiated an additional subset of the swashbuckling novel, the Ruritanian romance.

===Theatre===
The perceived significant and widespread role of swordsmanship in civilian society as well as warfare in the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods led to fencing being performed on theatre stages as part of plays. Soon actors were taught to fence in an entertaining, dramatic manner. Eventually fencing became an established part of a classical formation for actors.

===Movie===
Consequently, when movie theaters mushroomed, ambitious actors took the chance to present their accordant skills on the screen. Since silent movies were no proper medium for long dialogues, the classic stories about heroes who would defend their honour with sword in hand were simplified and sheer action would gain priority. This was the birth of a new kind of film hero: the swashbuckler. For Hollywood actors to depict these skilled sword fighters, they needed advanced sword training. Four of the most famous instructors for swashbuckling swordplay are William Hobbs, Anthony De Longis, Bob Anderson and Peter Diamond.

The larger-than-life heroics portrayed in some film franchise adventures (most notably the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies) set in the modern era have been described as swashbuckling.

==Film==

The genre has, apart from swordplay, always been characterized by influences that can be traced back to the chivalry tales of Medieval Europe, such as the legends of Robin Hood and King Arthur. It soon created its own drafts based on classic examples like &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1920), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1921), &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1934). Some films did also use motifs of pirate stories. Often these films were adaptations of classic historic novels published by well-known authors such as Alexandre Dumas, Rafael Sabatini, Baroness Emma Orczy, Sir Walter Scott, Johnston McCulley, and Edmond Rostand.

Swashbucklers are one of the most flamboyant Hollywood film genres, unlike cinema verite or modern realistic filmmaking. The genre attracted large audiences who relished the blend of escapist adventure, historic romance, and daring stunts in cinemas before it became a fixture on TV screens. With the focus on action, adventure, and, to a lesser degree, romance, there is little concern for historical accuracy. Filmmakers may mix incidents and events from different historical eras.

As a first variation of the classic swashbuckler there have also been female swashbucklers. Maureen O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Against All Flags&quot; and Jean Peters in &quot;Anne of the Indies&quot; were very early action film heroines. Eventually the typical swashbuckler motifs were used up because they had so often been shown on TV screens. Later films such as &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series and &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; include modern takes on the swashbuckler archetype.

==Television==
Television followed the films, especially in the UK, with &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Sword of Freedom&quot;, &quot;The Buccaneers&quot;, and &quot;Willam Tell&quot; between 1955 and 1960. US TV produced two series of &quot;Zorro&quot; in 1957 and 1990. Following the 1998 film &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;, a TV series about a female swashbuckler, the &quot;Queen of Swords&quot;, aired in 2000.

* In early 1883 James O&#x27;Neill (1847–1920) took over the lead role in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; at Booth&#x27;s Theater in New York. His interpretation of the part caused a sensation with the theater-going public and a company was immediately set up to take the play on tour. O&#x27;Neill bought the rights to the play. &quot;Monte Cristo&quot; remained a popular favorite and would continue to make its appearance on tour as regular as clockwork. O&#x27;Neill went on to play this role over 6,000 times.
* E. H. Sothern (1859–1933) was especially known for his heroic portrayal of Rudolph Rassendyl in the first stage adaptation of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, which he first played in 1895. The role made him a star.
*Douglas Fairbanks (1883–1939) was a Hollywood movie star of the silent film era and was widely regarded as the predecessor to Errol Flynn.
*Errol Flynn (1909–1959) was famously known for the action adventurer typified Hollywood&#x27;s idea of the swashbuckler in films as &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938), and &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940).
*Burt Lancaster (1913–1994) Although he was very much an all-round actor, successful in any kind of role, he starred in two swashbuckling films &quot;The Flame and the Arrow&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; (1952), both produced through his own film production company Norma Productions. Lancaster also starred in and produced two swashbuckler-esque adventure films made in the same time-frame, &quot;Ten Tall Men&quot; (1951) and &quot;His Majesty O&#x27;Keefe&quot; (filmed in 1952 but released in 1954). Lancaster, a former circus acrobat, was noted for performing his own stunts.
* Mikhail Boyarsky (born 1949), who played d&#x27;Artagnan in d&#x27;Artagnan and Three Musketeers and its four sequels, as well as other swashbuckler characters in historical adventure movies like Gardes-Marines, Forward!, Viva Gardes-Marines!, Don Cesar de Bazan, The Dog in the Manger, The Prisoner of Château d&#x27;If, Queen Margot, among others.

<text>The New Zealand Company, chartered in the United Kingdom, was a company that existed in the first half of the 19th century on a business model that was focused on the systematic colonisation of New Zealand. The company was formed to carry out the principles devised by Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who envisaged the creation of a new-model English society in the Southern Hemisphere. Under Wakefield&#x27;s model, the colony would attract capitalists, who would then have a ready supply of labour: migrant labourers who could not initially afford to be property owners but would have the expectation of one-day buying land with their savings.

The New Zealand Company established settlements at Wellington, Nelson, Wanganui and Dunedin and also became involved in the settling of New Plymouth and Christchurch. The original New Zealand Company started in 1825, with little success, then rose as a new company when it merged with Wakefield&#x27;s New Zealand Association in 1837, received its royal charter in 1840, reached the peak of efficiency about 1841, encountered financial problems from 1843 from which it never recovered, returned its charter in 1850 and wound up all remaining business with a final report in 1858.

== History ==
The company&#x27;s board members included aristocrats, Members of Parliament and a prominent magazine publisher, who used their political connections to ceaselessly lobby the British government to achieve its aims. The company bought a lot of land from Māori using questionable contracts and in many cases resold that land, with its title in doubt. The company launched elaborate, grandiose and sometimes fraudulent advertising campaigns. It vigorously attacked those it perceived as its opponents—chiefly the British Colonial Office, successive governors of New Zealand, the Church Missionary Society and the prominent missionary Reverend Henry Williams, and it stridently opposed the Treaty of Waitangi, which was an obstacle to the company&#x27;s obtaining the greatest possible amount of New Zealand land at the cheapest price. The company, in turn, was frequently criticised by the Colonial Office and New Zealand governors for its &quot;trickery&quot; and lies. Missionaries in New Zealand were also critical of the company for fear that its activities would lead to the &quot;conquest and extermination&quot; of Māori inhabitants.

The company viewed itself as a prospective quasi-government of New Zealand and in 1845 and 1846 proposed splitting the colony in two, along a line from Mokau in the west to Cape Kidnappers in the east, with the north reserved for Māori and missionaries and the south becoming a self-governing province, known as &quot;New Victoria&quot; and managed by the company for that purpose. The British Colonial Secretary rejected the proposal.

Only 15,500 settlers arrived in New Zealand as part of the company&#x27;s colonisation schemes, but three of its settlements would, along with Auckland, become and remain the country&#x27;s &quot;main centres&quot; and provide the foundation for the system of provincial government introduced in 1853.

=== 1825 expedition ===

The earliest organised attempt to colonise New Zealand came in 1825, when the New Zealand Company was formed in London, headed by the wealthy John George Lambton, Whig MP (and later 1st Earl of Durham). Other directors of the company were:
*East India Company merchants George Lyall, George Palmer (snr), Stewart Marjoribanks and Russell Ellice;
*politician and merchant Edward Ellice (brother of Russell, and also brother-in-law of Lambton);
* political economist Robert Torrens snr; landowner and politician Edward Littleton (later 1st Baron Hatherton);
*Royal Navy officer and politician Courtenay Boyle;
* banker James Pattison (sometime chair of the East India Company, and later Governor of the Bank of England;
* writer and politician Aaron Chapman; 
* politician and banker Abraham Wildey Robarts;
* shipping insurer Ralph Fenwick;
* solicitor John William Buckle;
* William Mannings; and 
* James Faden.

The company unsuccessfully petitioned the British Government for a 31-year term of exclusive trade and for command over a military force, anticipating that large profits could be made from New Zealand flax, kauri timber, whaling, and sealing.

Undeterred by the lack of government support for its plan to establish a settlement protected by a small military force, the company dispatched two ships to New Zealand the following year under the command of Captain James Herd, who was given the task of exploring trade prospects and potential settlement sites in New Zealand. On 5 March 1826 the ships, &quot;Lambton&quot; and &quot;Rosanna&quot;, reached Stewart Island, which Herd explored and then dismissed as a possible settlement, before sailing north to inspect land around Otago Harbour. Herd was unconvinced that area was the ideal location and sailed instead for Te Whanganui-a-Tara (present-day Wellington Harbour), which Herd named Lambton Harbour. Herd explored the area and identified land at the south-west of the harbour as the best place for a European settlement, ignoring the presence of a large pā that was home to members of Te Āti Awa tribe. The ships then sailed up the east coast to explore prospects for trade, stopping at the Coromandel Peninsula and the Bay of Islands. In January 1827 Herd surveyed parts of the harbour at Hokianga, where either he or the company&#x27;s agent on board negotiated the &quot;purchase&quot; of tracts of land from Māori in Hokianga, Manukau and Paeroa. The price for the land was &quot;five muskets, fifty three pounds powder, four pair blankets, three hundred flints and four musket cartridge boxes&quot;. After several weeks Herd and the New Zealand Company agent decided the cost of exporting goods was too high to be of economic value and they sailed to Sydney, where Herd paid off the crew and sold the stores and equipment, then returned to London. The venture had cost the New Zealand Company £20,000.

=== Wakefield&#x27;s influence ===

The failure of Lambton&#x27;s project came to the attention of 30-year-old aspiring politician Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who was serving three years in jail for abducting a 15-year-old heiress. Wakefield, who had grown up in a family with roots in philanthropy and social reform, also showed an interest in proposals by Robert Wilmot-Horton, Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies for state-assisted emigration programmes that would help British paupers escape poverty by moving to any of Britain&#x27;s colonies. In 1829 Wakefield began publishing pamphlets and writing newspaper articles that were reprinted in a book, promoting the concept of systematic emigration to Australasia through a commercial profit-making enterprise.

Wakefield&#x27;s plan entailed a company buying land from the indigenous residents of Australia or New Zealand very cheaply, then selling it to speculators and &quot;gentleman settlers&quot; for a much higher sum. The immigrants would provide the labour to break in the gentlemen&#x27;s lands and cater to their employers&#x27; everyday needs. They would eventually be able to buy their own land, but high land prices and low rates of pay would ensure they first laboured for many years.

In May 1830 Wakefield was released from prison and joined the National Colonisation Society, whose committee included Wilmot-Horton, nine MPs and three clergymen. Wakefield&#x27;s influence within the society quickly grew and by the end of the year his plans for colonisation of Australasia had become the central focus of the society&#x27;s pamphlets and lectures.

Despite the £20,000 loss incurred in his earlier venture, Lambton (from the 1830s known as Lord Durham) continued to pursue ways to become involved in commercial emigration schemes and was joined in his endeavours by Radical MPs Charles Buller and Sir William Molesworth. In 1831 and again in 1833 Buller and Molesworth backed Wakefield as he took to the Colonial Office elaborate plans to recreate a perfect English society in a new colony in South Australia in which land would be sold at a price high enough to generate profit to fund emigration. The Whig government in 1834 passed an Act authorising the establishment of the British Province of South Australia, but the planning and initial sales of land proceeded without Wakefield&#x27;s involvement because of the illness and death of his daughter. Land in the town of Adelaide was offered at £1 per acre on maps showing town and country sites—though the area was still little more than a sandhill—but sales were poor. In March 1836 a survey party sailed for South Australia and the first emigrants followed four months later. Wakefield claimed all credit for the establishment of the colony, but was disappointed with the outcome, claiming the land had been sold too cheaply.

Instead, in late 1836, he set his sights on New Zealand, where his theories of &quot;systematic&quot; colonisation could be put into full effect. He gave evidence to a House of Commons committee which itself comprised many Wakefield supporters, and when the committee handed down a report endorsing his ideas, he wrote to Lord Durham explaining that New Zealand was &quot;the fittest country in the world for colonisation&quot;. Wakefield formed the New Zealand Association, and on 22 May 1837 chaired its first meeting, which was attended by ten others including MPs Molesworth and William Hutt, and R.S. Rintoul of &quot;The Spectator&quot;. After the association&#x27;s third meeting, by which time London banker John Wright, Irish aristocrat Earl Mount Cashell and Whig MP William Wolryche-Whitmore were also on board and the group was attracting favourable newspaper attention, Wakefield drafted a Bill to bring the association&#x27;s plans to fruition.

The draft attracted stiff opposition from Colonial Office officials and from the Church Missionary Society, who took issue both with the &quot;unlimited power&quot; the colony&#x27;s founders would wield and what they regarded as the inevitable &quot;conquest and extermination of the present inhabitants&quot;. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the colonies Lord Howick and Permanent Under-Secretary James Stephen both were concerned about proposals for the settlements&#x27; founders to make laws for the colony, fearing it would create a dynasty beyond British government control, while Anglican and Wesleyan missionaries were alarmed by claims made in pamphlets written by Wakefield in which he declared that one of the aims of colonisation was to &quot;civilise a barbarous people&quot; who could &quot;scarcely cultivate the earth&quot;. Māori, Wakefield wrote, &quot;craved&quot; colonisation and looked up to the Englishman &quot;as being so eminently superior to himself, that the idea of asserting his own independence of equality never enters his mind&quot;. Wakefield suggested that once Māori chiefs had sold their land to settlers for a very small sum, they would be &quot;adopted&quot; by English families and be instructed and corrected. At a meeting on 6 June 1837 the Church Missionary Society passed four resolutions expressing its objection to the New Zealand Association plans, including the observation that previous experience had shown that European colonisation invariably inflicted grave injuries and injustices on the indigenous inhabitants. It also said the colonisation plans would interrupt or defeat missionary efforts for the religious improvement and civilisation of the Māori. The society resolved to use &quot;all suitable means&quot; to defeat the association and both the Church and Wesleyan missionary societies began to wage campaigns in opposition to the company&#x27;s plans, through pamphlets and lobbying to government.

=== Charter ===
In September 1837, four months after the New Zealand Association&#x27;s first meeting, discussions began with the 1825 New Zealand Company over a possible merger. The 1825 company claimed ownership of a million acres of New Zealand land acquired during its 1826 voyage, and Lord Durham, chairman of that company, was suggested as an ideal chairman of the new partnership. By the end of the year he had been elected to that role.

Through late 1837 the New Zealand Association vigorously lobbied both the British government and Prime Minister Lord Melbourne, then returned with a revised Bill that addressed some of the government&#x27;s concerns. On 20 December 1837 it was rewarded with the offer of a royal charter similar to those under which British colonies had been earlier established in North America. The chartered body was to take responsibility for the administration, and the legislative, judicial, military and financial affairs of the colony of New Zealand, subject to safeguards of control by the British Government. To receive the charter, however, the association was told by Colonial Secretary Lord Glenelg it would have to become a joint stock company, and therefore have &quot;a certain subscribed capital&quot;. In a letter to Lord Durham, Lord Glenelg explained that the government was aware of the risks of the proposed New Zealand venture and knew that the South Australian colony established under the Wakefield system was already heavily in debt. It therefore considered it reasonable that the interests of shareholders should coincide with those of emigrants in the pursuit of the colony&#x27;s prosperity. But members of the association decided the requirement was unacceptable. Reluctant to invest their own money in the venture, and wary of the risks of the shares being subject to fluctuations in the stock market, they rejected the offer. On 5 February 1838 the Colonial Secretary in turn advised Lord Durham that the charter had therefore been withdrawn. The New Zealand Association&#x27;s plans would again hinge on a Bill being introduced to, and passed by, Parliament.

Public and political opinion continued to run against the association&#x27;s proposals. In February 1838 &quot;The Times&quot; wrote disparagingly of the &quot;moral and political paradise&quot;, the &quot;radical Utopia in the Great Pacific&quot; conceived in &quot;the gorgeous fancy of Mr Edward Gibbon Wakefield&quot;, in March Parliament debated—then defeated—Molesworth&#x27;s motion of no confidence in the Colonial Secretary over his rejection of the association&#x27;s plans, and later that month the association&#x27;s second Bill, introduced by Whig MP Francis Baring on 1 June, was defeated 92 votes to 32 at its second reading. Lord Howick described the failed Bill as &quot;the most monstrous proposal I ever knew made to the House&quot;.

Three weeks after the Bill&#x27;s defeat, the New Zealand Association held its final meeting and passed a resolution to the effect that &quot;notwithstanding this temporary failure&quot;, members would persevere with their efforts to establish &quot;a well-regulated system of colonization&quot;. Two months later, on 29 August 1838, 14 supporters of the association and the 1825 New Zealand Company convened to form a joint-stock company, the New Zealand Colonisation Association. Chaired by Lord Petre, the company was to have paid-up capital of £25,000 in 50 shares of £50, and declared its purpose was &quot;the purchase and sale of lands, the promotion of emigration, and the establishment of public works&quot;. A reserved share of £500 was offered to Wakefield, who by then was in Canada, working on the staff of that colony&#x27;s new governor general, Lord Durham. By December, although it was still yet to attract 20 paid-up shareholders, the company decided to buy the barque &quot;Tory&quot; for £5250 from Joseph Somes, a wealthy shipowner and member of the committee.

Within the British Government, meanwhile, concern had grown about the welfare of Māori and increasing lawlessness among the 2,000 British subjects in New Zealand, who were concentrated in the Bay of Islands. Because of the population of British subjects there, officials believed colonisation was now inevitable and at the end of 1838 the decision was made to appoint a Consul as a prelude to the declaration of British sovereignty over New Zealand. And when Lord Glenelg was replaced as Colonial Secretary in late February, his successor, Lord Normanby, immediately brushed off demands from the New Zealand Colonisation Association for the royal charter that had been previously offered to the New Zealand Association.

On 20 March 1839 an informal meeting of members of the Colonisation Association and the 1825 New Zealand Company learned from Hutt the disturbing news that the Government&#x27;s Bill for the colonisation of New Zealand would contain a clause that land from then on would be able to be bought only from the Government. Such a move would be a catastrophic blow for the Colonisation Association, for whom success depended on being able to acquire land at a cheap price, directly from Māori, and then sell it at a high price to make a profit for shareholders and fund colonisation. The news created the need for swift action if private enterprise was to beat the Government to New Zealand. In a stirring speech, Wakefield told those present: &quot;Possess yourselves of the soil and you are secure—but if from delay you allow others to do it before you, they will succeed and you will fail.&quot;

Members of the two colonisation groups subsequently formed a new organisation, the New Zealand Land Company, with Lord Durham as its governor and five MPs among its 17 directors (in 1840 the directors were Joseph Somes, Viscount Ingestre, M.P., Lord Petre, Henry A. Aglionby, M.P., Francis Baring, M.P., John Ellorker Boulcott, John William Buckle, Russell Ellice, James Robert Gowen, John Hine, William Hutt, M.P., Stewart Marjoribanks, Sir William Molesworth, M.P., Alexander Nairn, Alderman John Pirie, Sir George Sinclair, M.P., John Abel Smith, M.P., Alderman William Thompson, M.P., Frederick James Tollemache, M.P., Edward G. Wakefield, Sir Henry Webb, Arthur Willis, George Frederick Young). The company acted urgently to fit out the &quot;Tory&quot;, advertise for a captain and surveyor and select Colonel William Wakefield as the expedition&#x27;s commander. William Wakefield was authorised to spend £3000 on goods that could be used to barter for land. By 12 May 1839, when the &quot;Tory&quot; left England under the command of Captain Edward Chaffers, the company had already begun advertising and selling land in New Zealand, and by the end of July—months before the company had even learned the &quot;Tory&quot; had arrived in New Zealand—all available sections for its first settlement had been sold. The company had already been warned in a letter from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary that the government could give no guarantee of title to land bought from Māori, which would &quot;probably&quot; be liable to repurchase by the Crown. The company had also been told that the Government could neither encourage nor recognise its proceedings.

The company&#x27;s prospectus, issued on 2 May, detailed the Wakefield system of colonisation the company would carry out: 1100 sections, each comprising one &quot;town acre&quot; and 100 &quot;country acres&quot;, would be sold in London, sight unseen, at £1 per acre, with the funds raised used to transport the emigrants to New Zealand. Emigrants would be selected either as capitalists or labourers, with labourers being required to work for the capitalists for several years before obtaining land of their own. One in 10 surveyed sections—scattered throughout the settlement—would be reserved for Māori who had been displaced, and the rest would be sold to raise £99,999, of which the company would retain 25 per cent to cover its expenses. Labourers would travel to New Zealand for free, while those who bought land and migrated could claim a 75 percent rebate on their fare.

===1839 expedition and land purchases===
The &quot;Tory&quot; was the first of three New Zealand Company surveyor ships sent off in haste to prepare for settlers in New Zealand. In August the &quot;Cuba&quot;, with a surveyors&#x27; team headed by Captain William Mein Smith, R.A., set sail, and a month later—still with no word on the success of the &quot;Tory&quot; and &quot;Cuba&quot;—on 15 September 1839 it was followed from Gravesend, London, by the &quot;Oriental&quot;, the first of five 500-ton immigrant ships hired by the company. Following the &quot;Oriental&quot; were the &quot;Aurora, Adelaide, Duke of Roxburgh&quot; and &quot;Bengal Merchant&quot;, plus a freight vessel, the &quot;Glenbervie&quot;, which all sailed with instructions to rendezvous on 10 January 1840 at Port Hardy on d&#x27;Urville Island where they would be told of their final destination. It was expected that by that time William Wakefield would have bought land for the first settlement and had it surveyed, and also inspected the company&#x27;s land claims at Kaipara and Hokianga.

The company provided Wakefield with a lengthy list of instructions to be carried out on his arrival. He was told to seek land for settlements where there were safe harbours that would foster export trade, rivers allowing passage to fertile inland property, and waterfalls that could power industry. He was told the company was eager to acquire land around harbours on both sides of Cook Strait and that while Port Nicholson appeared the best site he should also closely examine Queen Charlotte Sound and Cloudy Bay at the north of the South Island. He was told to explain to Māori that the company wanted to buy land for resale to allow large-scale European settlement and that he should emphasise to tribes that in every land sale, one-tenth would be reserved for Māori, who would then live where they were assigned by a lottery draw in London. Wakefield was told:

Wakefield arrived at Cook Strait on 16 August and spent several weeks exploring the bays and sounds at the north of the South Island. The &quot;Tory&quot; crossed Cook Strait on 20 September and with the aid of whaler and trader Dicky Barrett—who had lived among Māori in Taranaki and the Wellington area since 1828 and also spoke &quot;pidgin-Māori&quot;—Wakefield began to offer guns, utensils and clothing to buy land from the Māori around Petone. Within a week he had secured the entire harbour and all surrounding ranges, and from then until November went on to secure signatures and marks on parchments that supposedly gave the company ownership of 20 million acres (8 million hectares)—about one-third of New Zealand&#x27;s land surface at a cost of about a halfpenny an acre. On 25 October he persuaded 10 chiefs at Kapiti to add crosses at the foot of an 1180-word document that confirmed they were permanently parting with all &quot;rights, claims, titles and interests&quot; to vast areas of land in both the South and North Islands as far north as present-day New Plymouth. On 8 November in Queen Charlotte Sound he secured the signature of an exiled Taranaki chief, Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke, and 31 others for land whose description was near-identical to that of the Kapiti deal. On 16 November as the &quot;Tory&quot; passed Wanganui three chiefs came aboard the &quot;Tory&quot; to negotiate the sale of all their district from Manawatu to Patea. The areas in each deed were so vast Wakefield documented them by writing lists of place names, and finally expressed the company&#x27;s territory in degrees of latitude.

Wakefield had learned from Barrett the complicated nature of land ownership in the Port Nicholson area because of past wars and expulsions and from late October Wakefield was informed of—but dismissed—rumours that Māori had sold land that did not belong to them. Problems with some of their purchases were emerging, however. Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha boarded the &quot;Tory&quot; near Kapiti to tell Wakefield that in its October agreement Ngāti Toa intended the company to have not millions of acres at the top of the South Island, but just the two small areas of Whakatu and Taitapu. And in December, a week after arriving at Hokianga to inspect the land bought from the 1825 New Zealand Company, Wakefield was told by Ngāpuhi chiefs that the only land the New Zealand Land Company could claim in the north was about a square mile at Hokianga. Further, there was nothing at all for them at either Kaipara or Manukau Harbour. There was a prize for him, however, with his purchase on 13 December of the Wairau Valley in the north of the South Island. Wakefield bought the land for £100 from the widow of whaling Captain John Blenkinsopp, who had claimed to have earlier bought it off Te Rauparaha. That sale would lead to the 1843 Wairau Affray in which 22 English settlers and four Māori were killed.

Further purchases followed in Taranaki (60,000 acres in February 1840) and Wanganui (May 1840, the conclusion of negotiations begun the previous November); the company explained to the 1842 Land Claims Commission that while the earlier deeds covering the same land had been with the &quot;overlords&quot;, these new contracts were with residents of the lands, to overcome any resistance they might have to yield physical possession of the land.

In July the company reported it had sent 1108 labouring emigrants and 242 cabin passengers to New Zealand and despatched a total of 13 ships. Another immigrant vessel, the &quot;London&quot;, sailed for New Zealand on 13 August, and before the year it was followed by &quot;Blenheim&quot;, &quot;Slains Castle&quot;, , and &quot;Olympus&quot;.

===Treaty of Waitangi===

The New Zealand Company had long expected intervention by the British Government in its activities in New Zealand, and this finally occurred following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840. The English text of the Treaty is considered by many to have transferred sovereignty from Māori to the British Crown but this is far from a settled debate as the Te Reo Māori version has different wording. Regardless however, while under the Colonial Government&#x27;s so-called pre-emption clause, Māori were prohibited from selling land to anyone but the Government and its agents. Lieutenant-Governor Hobson immediately froze all land sales and declared all existing purchases invalid pending investigation. The treaty put the New Zealand Company in a very difficult position. It did not have enough land to satisfy the arriving settlers and it could no longer legally sell the land it claimed it owned.

Under instructions from the Colonial Office, Hobson was to set up a system in which much of the revenue raised from the sale of land to settlers would be used to cover the costs of administration and development, but a portion of the funds would also be used to send emigrants to New Zealand. That plan, says historian Patricia Burns, was further proof of the &quot;pervasive influence of the Wakefield theory&quot;.

In April the Rev. Henry Williams was sent south by Hobson to seek further signatures to the treaty in the Port Nicholson area. He was forced to wait for 10 days before local chiefs would approach him and blamed their reluctance to sign the treaty on pressure by William Wakefield. On 29 April, however, Williams was able to report that Port Nicholson chiefs had &quot;unanimously&quot; signed the treaty. William Wakefield was already strongly critical of both the treaty and Williams and repeatedly attacked the missionary in the company&#x27;s newspaper for his &quot;hypocrisy and unblushing rapaciousness&quot;.

Williams, in turn, was critical of the company&#x27;s dealings, noting that the deeds of purchase for land it had claimed to have bought from the 38 deg. to the 42 degrees parallel of latitude were drawn up in English, which was not understood by Māori who had signed it, and that the company&#x27;s representatives, including Barrett, had an equally poor grasp of Māori. Williams found that company representatives had met Māori chiefs at Port Nicholson, Kapiti and Taranaki, where neither party understanding the other and had not visited other places where the company claimed to have purchased land.

Hobson, meanwhile, was becoming alarmed at the news of the company&#x27;s growing assumption of power. He learned of their bid to imprison a Captain Pearson of the barque &quot;Integrity&quot; and that on 2 March they had raised the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand at Port Nicholson, proclaiming government by &quot;colonial council&quot; that claimed to derive its powers from authority granted by local chiefs. Interpreting the moves as smacking of &quot;high treason,&quot; Hobson declared British sovereignty over the entirety of the North Island on 21 May 1840, and on 23 May declared the council illegal. He then despatched his Colonial Secretary, Willoughby Shortland, with 30 soldiers and six mounted police on 30 June 1840, to Port Nicholson to tear down the flag. Shortland commanded the residents to withdraw from their &quot;illegal association&quot; and to submit to the representatives of the Crown. Hobson, claiming his hand had been forced by the New Zealand Company&#x27;s actions, also proclaimed sovereignty over the whole of New Zealand—the North Island by right of cession at Waitangi, and the South and Stewart Islands by right of discovery.

===Wellington===
Ignoring the wishes of William Wakefield, who wanted the initial settlement at the southwest side of the harbour where there were excellent anchorages for ships, Surveyor-General William Mein Smith began in January 1840 to layout 1100 one-acre (4047 m2) sections of the town, initially called &quot;Britannia&quot;, on the flat land at Pito-one (now Petone), at the north of the harbour. The sections, near the mouth of the Hutt River, were laid out in parallelograms, with the plan including boulevards and public parks. Settlers who had bought a town section had also bought 100 &quot;country acres&quot; (about 40ha), where they could grow their food. Smith considered it important to locate the town and country areas close together and the Hutt Valley appeared to promise that space. The drawback was that his chosen locality was a mix of dense forest, scrub, flax and swamp, its river was prone to flooding and the beach so flat that when the first passenger ships began to arrive—just four days after Smith began his survey work—they were forced to anchor 1600 metres from the shore. But construction of temporary houses began, as well as the assembly of wooden houses that had been carried on each ship, while tents also soon dotted the dunes behind the beach. Local Māori assisted with the construction and also provided food—fish, potatoes and other vegetables and occasionally pork.

Eight weeks later, in March, after all passenger ships had arrived, settlers voted to abandon surveying at Pito-one—where the swamps, repeated flooding and poor anchorage facilities were proving too much of an obstacle—and move the town to Wakefield&#x27;s preferred location of Thorndon at Lambton Bay (later Lambton Quay), which was named in honour of Lord Durham. Surveyors quickly encountered problems, however, when they discovered the land selected for the new settlement was still inhabited by Māori, who expressed astonishment and bewilderment to find Pākehā tramping through their homes, gardens and cemeteries and driving wooden survey pegs into the ground. Surveyors became involved in skirmishes with the Māori, most of whom refused to budge, and were provided with weapons to continue their work.

Wakefield had purchased the land during a frantic week-long campaign the previous September, with payment made in the form of iron pots, soap, guns, ammunition, axes, fish hooks, clothing—including red nightcaps—slates, pencils, umbrellas, sealing wax and jaw harps. Signatures had been gained from local chiefs after an explanation, given by Wakefield and interpreted by Barrett, that the land would no longer be theirs once payment was made. Evidence later provided to the Spain Land Commission—set up by the Colonial Office to investigate New Zealand Company land claims—revealed three major flaws: that chiefs representing pā of Te Aro, Pipitea and Kumutoto, where the settlement of Thorndon was to be sited, were neither consulted nor paid; that Te Wharepōuri, an aggressive and boastful young chief eager to prove his importance, had sold land he did not control; and that Barrett&#x27;s explanation and interpretation of the terms of the sale was woefully inadequate. Barrett told the Spain Commission hearing in February 1843: &quot;I said that when they signed their names the gentlemen in England who had sent out the trade might know who were the chiefs.&quot; Historian Angela Caughey also claimed it was extremely unlikely that Wakefield and Barrett could have visited all the villages at Whanganui-a-Tara in one day to explain the company&#x27;s intentions and seek approval.

In line with his instructions, Wakefield promised local Māori they would be given reserves of land equal to one-tenth of the area, with their allotments chosen by lottery and sprinkled among the European settlers. The reserves were to remain inalienable to ensure that the Māori would not quickly sell the land to speculators. Jerningham Wakefield, the nephew of William Wakefield who had also arrived on the &quot;Tory&quot; in 1839, espoused the company&#x27;s hope that interspersing Māori with white settlers would help them change their &quot;rude and uncivilised habits&quot;. In a later book on his New Zealand adventures he wrote: &quot;The constant example before their eyes, and constant emulation to attain the same results, would naturally lead the inferior race, by an easy ascent, to a capacity for acquiring the knowledge, habits, desires and comforts of their civilised neighbours.&quot;

In November 1840, the New Zealand Company directors advised Wakefield that they wished to name the town at Lambton Harbour after the Duke of Wellington in recognition of his strong support for the company&#x27;s principles of colonisation and his &quot;strenuous and successful defence against its enemies of the measure for colonising South Australia&quot;. Settlers enthusiastically accepted the proposal. The &quot;New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator&quot; was published in Wellington from 1840 to 1844. Initially privately owned by Samuel Revans, it was regarded as a &quot;mouthpiece of the New Zealand Company&quot;.

===Nelson===
In April 1841 the company informed the Colonial Secretary of its intention to establish a second colony &quot;considerably larger&quot; than the first. The colony was initially to be called Molesworth after Radical MP Sir William Molesworth, a supporter of Wakefield, but was renamed Nelson (after the British admiral) when Molesworth showed little interest in leading the colony. It was planned to cover , consisting of 1000 allotments. Each would be 150 acres (60 hectares) of rural land, 50 acres (20 hectares) of accommodation land and one &quot;town acre&quot; (4000 square metres), with half the funds raised by land sales being spent on emigration and about £50,000 ending up as company profits. The land would be sold at £301 per allotment or 30 shillings an acre, one pound an acre more than land at Wellington, with a lottery to determine the ownership of specific allotments.

Three ships, the &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Whitby&quot;, and &quot;Will Watch&quot;, sailed that month for New Zealand with surveyors and labourers to prepare plots for the first settlers (scheduled to follow five months later). Land sales proved disappointing, however, and threatened the viability of the settlement: by early June only 326 allotments had been sold, with only 42 purchasers intending to actually travel to New Zealand. Things had improved little by the drawing of the lottery in late August 1841, when only 371 of the allotments were drawn by purchasers, three-quarters of whom were absentee owners.

The ships arrived at Blind Bay (today known as Tasman Bay), where the expedition leaders searched for land suitable for the new colony, before settling on the site of present-day Nelson, an area described as marshy land covered with scrub and fern. In a meeting with local Māori, expedition leader Arthur Wakefield claimed to have gained recognition – in exchange for &quot;presents&quot; of axes, a gun, gunpowder, blankets, biscuits and pipes – for the 1839 &quot;purchases&quot; in the area by William Wakefield. By January 1842 the advance guard had built more than 100 huts on the site of the future town in preparation for the arrival of the first settlers. A month later the township was described as having a population of 500, along with bullocks, sheep, pigs and poultry, although the company was yet to identify or purchase any of the rural land for which purchasers had paid.

The search for this remaining would ultimately lead to the Wairau Affray – then known as the &quot;Wairau Massacre&quot; – of 17 June 1843, when 22 Europeans and four Māori died in a skirmish over land in the Wairau Valley, 25 km from Nelson. Arthur Wakefield claimed to have bought the land from the widow of a whaler who, in turn, had claimed to have bought it from chief Te Rauparaha. The chief denied having sold it. Although settlers in Nelson and Wellington were appalled at the slaughter at Wairau, an investigation by Governor Robert FitzRoy laid the blame squarely at the feet of the New Zealand Company representatives.

As early as 1839 the New Zealand Company had resolved to &quot;take steps to procure German emigrants&quot; and appointed an agent in Bremen. A bid in September 1841 to sell the Chatham Islands to the German Colonisation Company—yet to be formed—for £10,000 was quashed by the British Government, which declared that the islands were to be part of the colony of New Zealand and that any Germans settling there would be treated as aliens. The party of German migrants on the &quot;St Pauli&quot;, with 140 passengers including John Beit, the &quot;overbearing and arrogant, greedy, untruthful&quot; New Zealand Company agent in Hamburg, went to Nelson instead.

===Government intervention===

The New Zealand Company had begun its colonisation scheme without the approval of the British government; as late as May 1839 Parliamentary Under-secretary Henry Labouchere warned company director William Hutt that there was no guarantee that titles to land purchased from Māori would be recognised and that such land would be subject to repurchase by the Crown. In January and February 1840 both New South Wales Governor George Gipps and Hobson in New Zealand issued proclamations that all land previously purchased from Māori would have to be confirmed by government title, and that any future direct purchases from Māori were null and void.

Gipps introduced his New Zealand Land Claims Bill to the New South Wales Legislative Council in May 1840, instituting a process to appoint commissioners who would investigate all lands acquired from Māori and the conditions under which the transactions had taken place. The Bill also stipulated that Māori owned only the land which they &quot;occupied&quot;, by living on or cultivating it; all other land was deemed &quot;waste&quot; land and owned by the Crown. The subsequent Act, passed on 4 August, prohibited the grant of any land purchase greater than four square miles (2560 acres). The New Zealand Company had already claimed to have bought two million acres (8,000 km2), part of which it had sold directly to settlers, and when news of the government move reached Wellington in August it sparked panic, prompting hundreds of settlers to prepare to abandon their land and sail to Valparaíso, Chile. In a bid to restore certainty to the settlers over their land claims a three-man deputation was sent to Sydney to meet Gipps; in early December the deputation returned with news that Gipps would procure for the Wellington settlers a confirmation of their titles to 110,000 acres of land, as well as their town, subject to several conditions including that the 110,000 acres were taken in one continuous block, native reserves were guaranteed and that reserves were made for public purposes.

In late September or early October 1840, MP and New Zealand Company Secretary Charles Buller appealed to the Colonial Office for help for the company which he claimed was in &quot;distress&quot;. Over the next month, the two parties negotiated a three-part agreement that, once agreed, was hailed by the company as &quot;all that we could desire&quot;. Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell agreed to offer a royal charter for 40 years, which would allow the company to buy, sell, settle and cultivate lands in New Zealand, with the Colonial Land and Emigration Commission, formed in January 1840, to have oversight of the company&#x27;s colonisation activities. Russell also agreed to assess the total sum of money the company had spent on colonisation and then grant the company title to four acres for every pound it had expended. In return, the company would relinquish its claim to 20 million acres. He also promised the company a discount—at a level to be decided later—for a purchase from the government of 50,000 acres. The company began providing figures to the Colonial Office of its total outgoings, which included £20,000 paid to the 1825 company and £40,000 paid to the New Zealand Colonisation Company of 1838 as well as £5250 paid for the &quot;Tory&quot;. The company&#x27;s spending on placards, printing and advertising, employee salaries, and food and transport for the emigrants were also included in the total, along with the costs of goods, including firearms, that had been used to buy land. A final calculation in May 1841 was that under the agreed formula the company was entitled to an initial 531,929 acres, with possibly another 400,000 to 500,000 acres to come. In May Russell agreed to allow the company a 20 per cent discount on the cost of 50,000 acres it wished to buy in New Plymouth and Nelson.

Hobson visited the Wellington area for the first time in August 1841 and heard complaints first-hand from Māori both in the town and also from as far afield as Porirua and Kapiti that they had never sold their land. Hobson assured them that their unsold &quot;pā&quot; and cultivations would be protected, but within days provided William Wakefield with a schedule, dated 1 September, which identified 110,000 acres at Port Nicholson, Porirua and Manawatu, 50,000 acres at Wanganui and 50,000 acres (later lifted to 60,000 acres) at New Plymouth; the government would waive its rights of pre-emption in those defined areas (thus abandoning any move to reclaim or resell lands possibly still owned by &quot;residents&quot; in the wake of the company&#x27;s purchase from the &quot;overlords&quot;), and in a confidential note Hobson promised that the government would &quot;sanction any equitable arrangement you may make to induce those natives who reside within the limits referred to in the accompanying schedule, to yield up possession of their habitations&quot; as long as no force was used. FitzRoy pressured Te Aro Māori to accept £300 for valuable land in the middle of Wellington for which they had never been paid, by explaining that their land was almost valueless.

===New Zealand Land Commission===

In May 1842 Hampshire attorney William Spain, who had been appointed by Russell in January 1841 as an independent Land Commissioner, opened his official inquiry into New Zealand Company land claims and any non-Company counter-claims to the same lands. Spain quickly discovered that the New Zealand Company purchases in the Port Nicholson, Wanganui, and New Plymouth districts were hotly contested by Māori. In Wellington several important chiefs, notably those of Te Aro, Pipitea and Kumutoto pā took little or no part in the proceedings. Those in favour of &quot;selling&quot; the land gave two main reasons for their stance: European arms and settlement would give them protection against their enemies, notably the Ngāti Raukawa of Ōtaki who were expected to attack at any time; and they were aware of the wealth that a European settlement—&quot;their Pākehā&quot;—would bring them through trade and employment. Some sales were also motivated by complex power struggles among Māori &quot;iwi&quot;, with assent to purchases deemed as proof of status. Company officials and the Colonial Office in London each argued that if the Māori were to be compensated for land they had not sold, the other should pay it; the Colonial Office claimed that its agreement of November 1840 was made on the assumption that the company&#x27;s claim was valid, while the company objected to being asked to prove that Māori in all transactions had both understood the contracts and had the right to sell. Company representatives in London attempted to challenge the legality of Spain&#x27;s inquiry and instructed William Wakefield that he should not answer to it.

Spain, who was given a price scale that determined arbitrarily what each purchase should have been worth, concluded each of his investigations into the validity of the New Zealand Company purchases by announcing how much land they would be rewarded. The company was awarded 151,000 acres (61,155ha)at Nelson after payment of £800 but the claim on the Wairau valley was rejected. At Wellington the company was ordered to pay £1500 to complete the Port Nicholson agreement and it was then awarded 71,900 acres (29,100ha). Spain refused a Crown grant of any land at Porirua and promised just 100 acres (40.5ha) at Manawatu. He awarded 40,000 acres (16,200ha) at Wanganui and 60,000 acres (24,300ha) at Taranaki. In London, the Colonial Office had already decided that land claimed by settlers but not awarded to them by the Land Claims Commission should revert not to the Māori owners, but to the Crown.

The Taranaki ruling led to Spain&#x27;s downfall. Spain had made the decision based on information from William Wakefield that much of the Taranaki region had been sparsely populated by Māori at the time of the purchase. The cause of the depopulation was that most of the local Te Āti Awa population had either migrated to Ōtaki or the Cook Strait region after defeat by raiding Waikato war parties in the 1820s, or been enslaved by the Waikato, but many were now returning. Spain ruled that regardless of the reason for their departure, Te Āti Awa had forfeited the land and that the company purchase from the few remaining residents was valid. With tensions between settlers and Māori in Taranaki at an all-time high, and alerted by Protector of Aborigines George Clarke of problems with Spain&#x27;s Taranaki ruling, FitzRoy sailed in August 1844 for New Plymouth, where he was briefed by Bishop George Selwyn and then announced he would reverse Spain&#x27;s decision. Instead of the 60,000 acres in Taranaki, the company would be awarded just 3800 acres, where settlers were already located. The decision outraged settlers, who were aware of friction with returning Māori, but had been hoping the Governor would station a body of troops at New Plymouth or sanction the formation of a militia to protect their land. FitzRoy later wrote: &quot;It appeared so clear ... that the view taken by the land commissioner could not be adopted by the government without causing bloodshed, and the probable ruin of the settlement; because the injustice of awarding land to the New Zealand Company, which was well known not to have been purchased by them, was apparent to every native.&quot; FitzRoy&#x27;s decision infuriated Spain, whose resignation was then demanded by the Governor.

Spain&#x27;s award in Wanganui also failed to be delivered in full: some chiefs refused to sell regardless of the amount of compensation offered. Spain offered to return to Māori four sections of land along with £1000, which Wakefield attempted to distribute with the money in gold and silver, but when they continued to refuse Spain informed them their refusal would not prevent the land from going to the settlers.

===Further settlements===
The New Zealand Company also established a settlement at Wanganui in 1840, chiefly as a spillover settlement, the site of the rural land promised to Wellington purchasers. A traveller in the colony at the time described Wanganui as &quot;one of the unwholesome, mushroom settlements engendered by the New Zealand Company for the purpose of removing to a distance a portion of the clamorous script-holders who, on arriving from England, looked, and looked in vain, for their land.&quot; The Wanganui settlement was beset with problems when settlers arrived to find Māori on the land, denying it had been sold. The company also sent surveyors down the east coast of the South Island to consider further sites, where they made contact at Akaroa with the fledgling French colony established there under the auspices of Jean-François Langlois&#x27;s Nanto-Bordelaise Company.

The company also became indirectly involved in the settlement of New Plymouth in 1841, through its links with the Plymouth Company, to which it sold a total of 60,000 acres, of indeterminate location, in mid-1840. The Plymouth Company sent a survey party to choose where the settlement would be located and in January 1841 that company&#x27;s surveyor, Frederick Carrington, selected Taranaki. The Plymouth Company encountered financial difficulties that led to a merger of the two companies on 10 May 1841.

In July 1843 the New Zealand Company issued a prospectus for the sale of 120,550 acres (48,000 hectares), divided between town, suburban and rural lots at a new settlement called New Edinburgh. The location of the settlement still remained undetermined. An office was established in Edinburgh to attract Scottish emigrants. A 400,000 acre (160,000 hectare) block was selected around the harbour at Otago in January 1844. The company worked with the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland on the sale of, and ballot for, land and the first body of settlers sailed for what became the settlement of Dunedin in late November 1847.

A month later Gibbon Wakefield began actively promoting a plan he had proposed in 1843: a Church of England settlement. New Zealand Company directors initially hoped to site the settlement in the Wairarapa region in the lower North Island. When local Māori refused to sell, however, its surveyor inspected Port Cooper (Lyttelton Harbour) on the east coast of the South Island and chose this as the location. Land was bought from 40 members of the Ngāi Tahu iwi in June 1848. The colonising efforts were taken up by the Canterbury Association, Gibbon Wakefield&#x27;s new project, and the New Zealand Company became a silent partner in the settlement process, providing little more than the initial purchase funds. The first of the body of 1512 Canterbury settlers sailed on 8 September 1850 for their new home.

===Financial difficulties and dissolution===

The New Zealand Company began falling into financial difficulties from mid-1843 for two reasons. It had planned to buy land cheaply and sell it dearly and anticipated that a colony based on a higher land price would attract affluent colonists. The profits from the sale of land were to be used to pay for free passage of the working-class colonists and for public works, churches and schools for instance. For this scheme to work it was important to get the right proportion of labouring to propertied immigrants. In part the failure of the company&#x27;s plans were because this proportion was never achieved – there were always more labourers, whose emigration was heavily subsidised by the company, than landed gentry.

The second major flaw arose because a large proportion of the land in the new colony was bought for speculative reasons by people who had no intention of migrating to New Zealand and developing the land they had bought. This meant that the new colonies had a serious shortage of employers and consequently a shortage of work for the labouring classes. From the outset, the New Zealand Company was forced to be the major employer in the new colonies and this proved a serious financial drain on the company. Repeated approaches were made to the British government seeking financial assistance and in late 1846 the company accepted an offer for a £236,000 advance with strict conditions on, and oversight of, future company operations.

In June 1850 the company admitted land sales in Wellington, Nelson and New Plymouth had remained poor and its land sales for the year ended April 1849 amounted to only £6,266. With little prospect of trading its way to profitability, the company surrendered its charter. A select committee report concluded the company&#x27;s losses were &quot;mainly attributable to their own proceedings, characterised as they were in many respects by rashness and maladministration.&quot;

Gibbon Wakefield, who had resigned from the company in disgust after its 1846 financial arrangement with the British government, remained defiant to the end, declaring in 1852 that had the company been left alone it would have paid a dividend, recouped its capital &quot;and there would now be 200,000 settlers in New Zealand&quot;.

The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 provided for a quarter of the proceeds of land sales of land previously purchased by the New Zealand Company would go to pay off the debt until it was paid off.

The company, in its final report in May 1858, conceded it had erred, but said the communities they had planted had now assumed &quot;gratifying proportions&quot; and they could look forward to the day when &quot;New Zealand shall take her place as the offspring and counterpart of her Parent Isle ... the Britain of the Southern Hemisphere.&quot;

<text>José Luis Félix Chilavert González (; born 27 July 1965) is a Paraguayan former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Sportivo Luqueño, Guaraní, San Lorenzo de Almagro, Real Zaragoza, Vélez Sarsfield, RC Strasbourg, Peñarol and the Paraguay national team.

Chilavert won 12 club titles, including the 1994 Copa Libertadores and the 1994 Intercontinental Cup, while playing for Vélez Sarsfield, and is a three-time IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper award winner. A fast and agile shot-stopper, known for his leadership, strong personality, and goalkeeping ability, he was regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world in his prime; outside of his goalkeeping position, Chilavert was also known for his outfield skills and ability as a free kick specialist, and often took penalties. He scored 67 goals in his professional career, many of them crucial, including eight in international matches. Four of his international goals were scored during Paraguay&#x27;s qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Chilavert is the second-highest goalscoring goalkeeper of all time, surpassed only by Brazilian keeper Rogerio Ceni, and is one of only three goalkeepers to score a hat-trick. Chilavert was also known for his eccentricity and his fiery temper, which brought him his fair share of controversies; most notorious among them was his being sent off in 1997 for brawling with Colombian striker Faustino Asprilla. He was nicknamed &quot;El Buldog&quot; (&quot;The Bulldog&quot;) and often wore a cartoon bulldog on his goalkeeper jersey.

Chilavert appeared for the Paraguay national team 74 times from 1989 to 2003, scoring eight goals and representing the team at five major tournaments. Chilavert appeared for Paraguay at two FIFA World Cup tournaments (1998 and 2002), where he served as captain on both occasions, and appeared in three Copa América tournaments (1991, 1993, and 1997). Chilavert was also included in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Team of the Tournament.

Chilavert ran for president of Paraguay in the 2023 general election under the Party of the Youth, getting less than 1% of the popular vote.

==Early years==
Chilavert grew up in Luque, Gran Asunción, in a poor family, and walked barefoot until the age of seven. His parents were Catalino Chilavert, a state bureaucrat, and Nicolasa González. At the age of five, he had three siblings and two responsibilities: to milk cows and sell the milk in Ñu Guazú, a rural suburb of Luque. One of his siblings, Rolando Chilavert, is also a football player.

==Club career==
Chilavert made his footballing debut with Sportivo Luqueño, where he was trained by Modesto Sandoval. In 1989, he played for the Paraguay national team for the first time.

He later moved to Spain, where he played for Real Zaragoza. In 1988, whilst Chilavert played for Real Zaragoza, he stated that &quot;the fans used to freak out&quot; when he would come out with the ball at his feet and &quot;scream at me to get back in goal. I&#x27;ve never stopped to think about what others are saying. I just rely on my abilities. Later on, I started to practice penalties and free kicks until they gave me the job for real&quot;. Chilavert admitted to staying behind after training to practice 80 to 120 free kicks, which in his opinion was how he got better.

 After his time at Real Zaragoza, he moved to Argentina, where he played with Vélez Sársfield, helping them win the Primera División four times, as well as the Copa Libertadores and the Intercontinental Cup, both in 1994. In 1999, he became the first goalkeeper known to score a hat-trick in the history of professional football, while playing for Vélez against Ferro Carril Oeste, scoring all three goals through penalties. He also scored a free kick from behind the half-way line against River Plate.

In the 2001 Coupe de France Final, Chilavert scored the winning penalty in the shootout victory over Amiens.

==International career==

Chilavert was voted &quot;World Goalkeeper of the Year&quot; by the IFFHS in 1995, 1997, and 1998. He was sent off alongside Faustino Asprilla in the qualifiers, in which Asprilla had to convince a hitman to not murder Chilavert afterwards. Chilavert participated in the 1998 World Cup, where he became the first goalkeeper ever to take a direct free kick in the World Cup finals, almost scoring against Bulgaria. With two clean sheets in the first round, he helped take Paraguay to the round of sixteen, where the team lost to France on a golden goal scored by Laurent Blanc. Chilavert had made boasts about being the Cup&#x27;s best goalkeeper before the tournament, and after the tournament, FIFA indeed named Chilavert on the tournament All-Star Squad for his performances, alongside French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez.

Chilavert refused to take part in the 1999 Copa América, angering the Paraguayan government, as he claimed funding should be used for education.

FIFA gave Chilavert a four-game suspension (later reduced to three) for spitting on Brazil&#x27;s Roberto Carlos at the conclusion of a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification game. As a result, he watched Paraguay&#x27;s first game of the 2002 World Cup against South Africa from the stands.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/si&quot;&gt;&quot;Flamboyant Chilavert still Paraguay&#x27;s biggest star&quot; . &quot;CNN Sports Illustrated&quot;. 25 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilavert accused Roberto Carlos of racism and of making obscene gestures during the match. Chilavert later claimed that Roberto Carlos came up to him after the match and said &quot;Indian, we have won 2–0, you are a disaster&quot;. He also justified his action by saying he had been provoked by the Brazilians, who had called him the weakest link of Paraguay before the match, and also claimed the match was like a war and that Brazil should return land to Paraguay lost in the War of the Triple Alliance in the 19th century.

Before the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Paraguay manager Cesare Maldini had faced criticism in Paraguay, but Chilavert defended Maldini for his experience. He also expressed great confidence in the ability of the Paraguayan team and downplayed his role on the team. During the World Cup, Chilavert made an error against Spain on Morientes&#x27; 2–1 goal as Paraguay lost 3–1. Chilavert almost redeemed himself later with a good free kick attempt, but the shot was saved by Casillas. Before the match, Chilavert had vowed to score against Spain if Paraguay got a free kick &quot;within range&quot;. Before the last match in the group stage, Paraguay had to beat Slovenia and Spain had to beat South Africa, with a combined margin of three goals, for Paraguay to go through to the last 16. The match started badly for Paraguay, with Carlos Paredes sent off in the 21st minute, and continued with Milenko Ačimovič taking the lead for the Slovenians right before half-time after Chilavert failed to grip the ball and allowed it to slip between his legs into the goal. But Paraguay – inspired by substitutes Nelson Cuevas and Jorge Campos – recovered to defeat Slovenia 3–1, scoring three times in the last 25 minutes, and when Spain also defeated South Africa 3–2, that victory meant that Paraguay was through to the next round, where they would play Germany. In their second-round match against Germany, despite several saves from Chilavert, Paraguay lost 1–0, courtesy of a late Oliver Neuville goal.

In total, Chilavert earned 74 international caps for Paraguay and achieved a goalkeeper record of eight international goals. He retired from international football in 2003.

==Retirement and post-career==
Chilavert announced his retirement from football in December 2003, but decided to come out of retirement to return to Vélez. Chilavert had just won the Uruguayan league with Peñarol when he initially retired. He finally retired permanently in 2004, playing his last match, a farewell testimonial, on 11 November of that year – fittingly, he scored a goal.

In 2005, Chilavert received a suspended six-month prison sentence in France for the use of false documents related to the compensation for the end of his contract with Strasbourg.

Chilavert was a commentator for American television network Univision during the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup, alongside Jorge Pérez-Navarro. Chilavert vowed that if he had gone to the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, he would have tried again to become the first goalkeeper to score a goal.

==Personal life and personality==

Chilavert is married to Marcela, an English language teacher he met in Buenos Aires while playing for San Lorenzo de Almagro. In 1998, they had a daughter named Anahí.

===Controversies===
Chilavert has allegedly thrown punches at Faustino Asprilla and Diego Maradona. He was suspended for four matches for his altercation with the former that occurred during a World Cup qualifier in 1997.

He once received a suspended prison sentence for attacking a physiotherapist.

Chilavert was a guest commentator for Univision during the Copa América Centenario but was removed from the broadcasts after CONMEBOL President Alejandro Dominguez told the network to remove Chilavert. Chilavert had criticized Dominguez and called him corrupt on the air during Paraguay&#x27;s Group A match against Colombia.

In 2018, Chilavert called for the expulsion of the British ambassador to Paraguay Matthew Hedges after the latter made controversial statements about the conviction of 12 farmers in a case relating to the violent deaths of six police officers and 11 rural workers in 2012. During the altercation, Chilavert made anglophobic and homophobic comments, the latter referencing Hedges&#x27;s homosexuality, calling him &#x27;anormal&#x27;.

===Leadership and morality===
Chilavert defended Cesare Maldini from press criticism when Maldini was appointed as Paraguay&#x27;s coach for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Chilavert stated that &quot;About 90% of sports journalists in Paraguay are incompetent&quot; and welcomed criticism following Paraguay&#x27;s performance in Korea and Japan if they were to perform poorly.

During his career, Chilavert was touted as Paraguay&#x27;s future president. Chilavert was labelled &quot;a revolutionary the kind of which South America has not seen since the days of Che Guevara.&quot;

Chilavert refused to participate at the 1999 Copa América on home soil, complaining about the incompetence of the local directors. Despite being officially honoured by the government, he said that his country should invest money in education rather than football. Chilavert also routinely dismissed his country&#x27;s politicians as corrupt, incompetent and responsible for keeping many Paraguayans in poverty. He claimed that when his playing days were over, he would stand for president and enforce his own brand of law and order.

During 2008 and 2009, the former goalkeeper demonstrated his support for Paraguayan Olympic thrower Edgar Baumann against corruption in Paraguayan sport when the athlete had been robbed of his right to compete at the 2000 Sydney Olympics due to a scandal from the Paraguayan Olympic Committee. Chilavert supported Baumann during the lawsuit which had been filed against the Olympic Committee with Chilavert stated that the then president of the Olympic Committee, Ramón Zubizarreta, should be expulsed for hurting athletes and not giving them benefits.

In 2009, Chilavert, along with Claudio Escauriza, Tomás Orué and lawyer Alejandro Rubin, attended a Press Conference at Asunción Shopping Centre Shopping del Sol, in support of Edgar Baumann, who had received a favourable ruling from the Paraguay Supreme Court in a case against the Paraguay Olympic Committee president Ramón Zubizarreta for robbing him the right of competing at the 2000 Summer Olympics and also taking his sums of money that he earned from his scholarship.

<doc id="315361" wikidata="Q1370300" url="?curid=315361" title="Mount Rainier (packet writing)">
<text>Mount Rainier (MRW) is a format for writable optical discs which provides the packet writing and defect management. Its goal is the replacement of the floppy disk. It is named after Mount Rainier, a volcano near Seattle, Washington, United States.

Mount Rainier can be used only with drives that explicitly support it (a part of SCSI/MMC and can work over ATAPI), but works with standard CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+/-R and DVD+/-RW media.

The physical format of MRW on the disk is managed by the drive&#x27;s firmware, which remaps physical drive blocks into a virtual, defect-free space. Thus, the host computer does not see the physical format of the disk, only a sequence of data blocks capable of holding any filesystem.

== Design ==
The time needed for the disk formatting is shortened to about one minute by the background formatting capabilities of the drive. Formatting allocates some sectors at the end of the disk for defect management. Defective sectors are recorded at a table in the lead-in (an administrative area) and in a copy of the table in the lead-out.

From the host computer&#x27;s perspective, an MRW disc provides a defect-free block-accessible device, upon which any host supported filesystem may be written. Such filesystems may be FAT32, NTFS, etc., but the preferred format is usually UDF 1.02, as this file format is widely supported. An MRW-formatted CD-RW with a UDF filesystem gives approximately 500 MB free space.

Mt. Rainier allows write access to a disc within seconds after insertion and spin-up, even while a background formatting sequence is taking place. Before this technology, a user would have to wait for the formatting to complete before writing any data to a new disc. It is even possible to read (but not write) MRW disks without an MRW-compatible drive; A &quot;remapper&quot; device driver is needed, an example of which is EasyWrite Reader for Windows.

An alternative to MRW is to physically format a disc in UDF 1.5 or higher using the spared build. This is achieved by the use of specialized packet writing software, or operating systems that support UDF versions 1.5 and above. MRW capabilities overlap somewhat with that of UDF 1.5+.

Information about the exact format on disc is sparse. For a limited overview of the format on disc see.

== Advantages ==
Advantages of MRW over UDF 1.5+ include:

* fast background formatting of the media
* finer grained packet size of 2K versus 64K
* file system independence
* does not depend on the host system to perform defect management

Advantage of UDF 1.5+ over MRW include:

* more portable, as UDF 1.5+ alone does not need specialized drive hardware to write, and the computer needs neither an MRW driver for a MRW-capable optical drive nor an MRW reader for drives that are incapable of reading MRW natively, reducing software overhead.

== Operating system support ==
Mount Rainier is implemented natively in Windows Vista and Windows 7. Linux has built-in MRW support since kernel version 2.6.2 (2004). Amiga OS4 supports this natively since the first beta appeared in 2004. Support for reading this format was also added to Mac OS X. Operating systems that don&#x27;t support MRW natively (notably Windows XP and prior versions) need third-party software to read and write MRW-formatted discs, and these tend to be the same packet writing utilities which allow native UDF filesystems to be written to optical media.

Some optical disc software, such as IsoBuster, can support Mount Rainier on non-MR drives.

The EasyWrite logo is the marketing symbol created by Philips for CD drives that are Mount Rainier compatible.

CD-MRW stands for Compact disc – Mount Rainier Read/Write.

<doc id="315362" wikidata="Q941704" url="?curid=315362" title="Child Online Protection Act">
<text>The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) was a law in the United States of America, passed in 1998 with the declared purpose of restricting access by minors to any material defined as harmful to such minors on the Internet. The law, however, never took effect, as three separate rounds of litigation led to a permanent injunction against the law in 2009.

The law was part of a series of efforts by US lawmakers legislating over Internet pornography. Parts of the earlier and much broader Communications Decency Act had been struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1997 (&quot;Reno v. ACLU&quot;); COPA was a direct response to that decision, narrowing the range of material covered. COPA only limits commercial speech and only affects providers based within the United States.

COPA required all commercial distributors of &quot;material harmful to minors&quot; to restrict their sites from access by minors. &quot;Material harmful to minors&quot; was defined as material that by &quot;contemporary community standards&quot; was judged to appeal to the &quot;prurient interest&quot; and that showed sexual acts or nudity (including female breasts). This is a much broader standard than obscenity.

== Litigation history ==

On February 1, 1999, Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr. of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted a preliminary injunction blocking COPA enforcement. In 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the injunction and struck down the law, ruling that it was too broad in using &quot;community standards&quot; as part of the definition of harmful materials.

In May 2002, the Supreme Court reviewed this ruling in &quot;Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union&quot; (2002), and found the given reason insufficient and returned the case to the Circuit Court. The law remained blocked there. On March 6, 2003, the 3rd Circuit Court again struck down the law as unconstitutional, this time finding that it would hinder protected speech among adults. The government again sought review in the Supreme Court.

On June 29, 2004, in &quot;Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union&quot; (2004), the Supreme Court upheld the injunction on enforcement, ruling that the law was likely to be unconstitutional. Notably, the court mentioned that &quot;filtering’s superiority to COPA is confirmed by the explicit findings of the Commission on Child Online Protection, which Congress created to evaluate the relative merits of different means of restricting minors&#x27; ability to gain access to harmful materials on the internet.&quot; The court also wrote that it was five years since the district court had considered the effectiveness of filtering software and that two less-restrictive laws had been passed since COPA. One law prohibits misleading domain names, and the other prohibits creating a child-safe .kids domain. Given the rapid pace of internet development, government officials thought these two laws might be sufficient to restrict access by minors to specific material.

===Further proceedings===
The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the district court for a trial, which began on October 25, 2006. In preparation for that trial, the Department of Justice issued subpoenas to various search engines to obtain Web addresses and records of searches as one part of a study undertaken by a witness in support of the law. The search engines turned over the requested information, except for Google, which challenged the subpoenas. The court limited the subpoena to a sample of URLs in Google&#x27;s database, but declined to enforce the request for searches conducted by users; Google then complied.

On March 22, 2007, Judge Reed once again struck down COPA, finding the law facially in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In addition to the plaintiffs ACLU et al., several witnesses testified in defense of First Amendment rights on the Internet, including the director of the Erotic Authors Association, Marilyn Jaye Lewis. Reed issued an order permanently enjoining the government from enforcing COPA, commenting that &quot;perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are chipped away in the name of their protection.&quot; The government again appealed, and the case was heard before the Third Circuit.

On July 22, 2008, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 2007 decision.

On January 21, 2009, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear appeals of the lower court decision, effectively shutting down the law.

<doc id="315366" wikidata="Q3118399" url="?curid=315366" title="Flint sit-down strike">
<text>The 1936–1937 Flint sit-down strike, also known as the General Motors sit-down strike, or the great GM sit-down strike, was a sitdown strike at the General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan, United States. It changed the United Automobile Workers (UAW) from a collection of isolated local unions on the fringes of the industry into a major labor union, and led to the unionization of the domestic automobile industry.

==Background==

GM employed 208,981 hourly workers before the Great Depression. These workers were paid around $1,195 annually. After the Great Depression jobs were increasing but GM had 30,000 fewer employees than before the Great Depression. The pay was increasing nationwide in 1936 but at GM the pay was stagnant. Work Progress estimated for a four-person family $1,434.79 was needed. GM&#x27;s records document that the annual average for full time workers was $1,200 to $1,300. Even with the declining pay rates, workers were required to work at a faster pace to make up for the loss from the Great Depression.

The United Automobile Workers (UAW) labor union had only just been formed in 1935 and held its first convention in 1936. Shortly thereafter the union decided it could not survive by organizing campaigns at smaller plants as it had in the past. Instead they would organize automobile workers and go after the biggest and most powerful employer, General Motors Corporation. They would do this by focusing on their most valuable plants in Flint, Michigan. As stated by Henry Kraus, a UAW organizer of the strike, &quot;It was the heart-and-nerve center of the vast combine. Creators of fortunes, incomparable benefactor to the chosen few, prize milch-cow of America&#x27;s most patrician family, the du Ponts, whose 10,000,000 shares of GM stock assured them a one-fourth cut of the corporation&#x27;s unabating profits, whatever happened in this central city of the corporation, in this non-descript over-size village, reverberated throughout the financial capitalists of the nation&quot;. The importance of these plants to GM cannot be understated: the production plants in Flint were essential to the multiple lines of GM cars, and to the cars of GM&#x27;s subsidiary companies like Chevrolet and Buick. As explained by Henry Kraus, &quot;The great concentration of autoworkers in Flint was not at the body plants but at Chevrolet and Buick which employed 14,000 and 16,000 men respectively – the largest of all general Motors&#x27; 60-odd factories&quot;. Another Chevrolet factory, Plant No. 4, would be critical to the sit-down strike as it produced the engines for all Chevrolet cars sold at the time. These plants were vital to production and strikes would cripple GM production throughout the country. The UAW recently separated from the much larger union, The American Federation of Labor (AFL).

Organizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan. GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. As Wyndham Mortimer, the first UAW officer put in charge of organizing the campaign in Flint, entered the town, he was noticed. The day after he entered Flint, in early June 1936, he was being followed by people who were probably from the General Motors Company, &quot;When he went through the front door, the other put his paper down and followed him out into the street. And thereafter, he or one of two others always managed to be with him&quot;.

GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. Mortimer concluded after talking to Flint auto workers that the existing locals, which had only 122 members out of 45,000 auto workers in Flint, were riddled with spies. Accordingly, he decided that the only safe way to organize Flint was simply to bypass those locals. Mortimer, Eric Branoff, Roy Reuther, Henry Kraus, and Ralph Dale began meeting with Flint auto workers in their homes, keeping the names of new members a closely guarded secret from others in Flint and at UAW headquarters.

As the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the dies from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for Buicks, Pontiacs, and Oldsmobiles, and another in Cleveland that produced Chevrolet parts. The union planned to strike these plants after the New Year, when Frank Murphy would become Governor of Michigan.

==The strike==

Events forced the union to accelerate its plans when the workers at Cleveland&#x27;s Fisher Body plant went on strike on December 28, 1936, due to two brothers being fired from the assembly line. The UAW immediately announced that it would not settle the Cleveland strike until it reached a national agreement with GM covering all of its plants. At the same time the union made plans to shut down Fisher #1 in Flint. Genora Johnson Dollinger was one of the main organizers and protester for the Flint sit-down. Robert Travis was the UAW organizer during the strike. On December 30, at 8:00 AM, the union learned that GM was planning to move the dies out of Fisher #1. UAW lead organizer Bob Travis immediately called a lunchtime meeting at the union hall across the street from the plant, explained the situation, then sent the members across the street to occupy the plant. The Flint sit-down strike began.

In a conventional strike, union members leave the plant and establish a picket line to discourage other employees from entering, thus preventing the employer from operating. In a sit-down strike, the workers physically occupy the plant, keeping management and others out. By remaining inside the factory rather than picketing outside of it, striking workers prevented owners from bringing strikebreakers to resume production. It was in some ways easier to maintain the morale of participants in a sit-down than in a conventional strike. The strikers were removed from outside pressures and the hostility of the community that their action might have induced. Bad weather did not constitute a problem for sit-downers as it did for the pickets in an outside strike.

The Flint sit-down strikers set up their own civil system within the strike. A mayor and other civic officials were elected by the workers to maintain order within the plant. Departments included Organized Recreation, Information, Postal Service, and Sanitation. All rules were enforced by what was called a &quot;Kangaroo Court&quot; by the workers. Any person who broke the rules was given a trial, and punishments ranged from washing dishes to expulsion from the plant (in the most extreme cases). It was important for the strikers to maintain order in the plant; if property damage occurred, the Governor would intervene with the National Guard. In addition to maintaining order, the civic government also ensured a steady stream of supplies from friendly vendors outside the plant. Most of the meals for the approximately 2,000 workers occupying the plant were provided free of charge by a diner across the street.

== Spread of the strike ==
Once the strike had been established in Flint, workers at other General Motors plants joined the strike:

* December 31: Fisher Body and Chevrolet plant in Norwood, Ohio. Workers at the Guide Lamp plant in Anderson, Indiana conducted a sit-down strike.
* January 4: Sit-down strike at Toledo, Ohio&#x27;s Chevrolet plant
* January 5: Sit-down strike at Chevrolet and Fisher Body in Janesville.
* January 8: Sit-down strike at the 3800-worker Cadillac plant in Detroit, organized by Walther Reuther&#x27;s West Side local. 
* January 12: Sit-down strike at the Detroit plant of Fleetwood, a Cadillac supplier. Around ninety workers began the sit-down, which held until January 15, when it was converted into conventional strike. Reuther called the takeover a protest of police brutality in Flint on January 11.
* January 13: A conventional strike at St. Louis Fisher Body and Chevrolet followed an unsuccessful attempt at a sit-down the prior day. Striking workers were supported by union members from Kansas City.
* January 25: Reportedly a strike at Oakland, California&#x27;s Fisher Body and Chevrolet, though General Motors attributed to stoppage to lack of materials.
* February 1: Occupation of Chevrolet No. 4 plant in Flint

By January 25, the strike had major secondary effects throughout General Motors&#x27; chain of production, leading fifty GM plants to close and suspending work for 150,000 employees.

Protests in solidarity with the strike were held at the GM Buildings in New York City (February 1) and Detroit (February 6).

==Resistance==
The police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts, led by Bob Travis and Roy Reuther. They were able to withstand several waves of attack, eventually ending the standoff. The strikers dubbed this &quot;The Battle of Running Bulls&quot;, a mocking reference to the police (&quot;bulls&quot;). Fourteen strikers were injured by gunfire during the battle.

At the time, Vice President John Nance Garner supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The president urged GM to recognize a union so the plants could re-open.

GM obtained a second injunction against the strike on February 2, 1937. GM was granted the injunction by Judge Edward S. Black. Judge Black owned over three thousand shares of GM. Judge Black was disbarred from the case after the UAW found out about the revelation. The union not only ignored the order, but spread the strike to Chevrolet Plant #4. To avoid tipping its hand, the union let it be known in the hours before the move that it intended to go after another plant in the complex, changing directions only at the last minute. GM, tipped off by an informant within the UAW, was ready and waiting for the union at the other plant and caught completely off guard at Plant #4. The strike ended after 44 days.

That development forced GM to bargain with the union. John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM&#x27;s representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW&#x27;s, so Governor Frank Murphy acted as courier and intermediary between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the Michigan National Guard, not to evict the strikers, but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike-breakers. The two parties finally reached agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM&#x27;s employees who were members of the union for the next six months.

==Conclusion==
The agreement that GM consented to was to rehire workers that were a part of the strike, allow workers to wear buttons and other symbols that represented unions, and granted 6 months of negotiations in the plants that participated in a strike to UAW-CIO.

As short as this agreement was, it gave the UAW instant legitimacy. The workers there also got a 5% increase in pay and were allowed to talk about the union during lunch. The UAW capitalized on that opportunity, signing up 100,000 GM employees and building the union&#x27;s strength through grievance strikes at GM plants throughout the country. Several participants in the strike, including Charles I. Krause, went on to greater prominence within the union. Other notable participants in the sit-down strike were future D-Day hero and Greco-Roman wrestling champion Dean Rockwell, labor leader and future UAW president Walter Reuther, and the uncle of documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, whose debut feature &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; contains a clip from the strike.

In the next year, UAW membership grew from 30,000 to 500,000 members. Employees of other car manufacturers such as Ford joined, as the entire industry was rapidly unionized. As later noted by the BBC, &quot;the strike was heard &#x27;round the world&quot;.

The Sit-Down Strike projected a principle weapon of mass organization in the labor industry projecting nearly 5000 strikes to come within the next year. Giving labor workers newfound unionization regardless of race, education status creating opportunities for membership agreements, payroll negotiation, and even government protection for workers. The Sit-Down Strike provoked a newfound impact in the labor industry, giving the workers a newfound confidence to join unions and use their voice.

<text>The National Forest is an environmental project in central England run by The National Forest Company. From the 1990s, of north Leicestershire, south Derbyshire and southeast Staffordshire have been planted in an attempt to blend ancient woodland with newly planted areas to create a new national forest. It stretches from the western outskirts of Leicester in the east to Burton upon Trent in the west, and is planned to link the ancient forests of Needwood and Charnwood.

In January 2018 the UK government unveiled plans to create a new English Northern Forest extending from Liverpool to Hull. It will shadow the path of the east-west M62 motorway.

==The National Forest Company==

The National Forest Company is a not-for-profit organisation established in April 1995 as a company limited by guarantee. It is supported by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), with the aim of converting one third of the land within the boundaries of the National Forest () to woodland, by encouraging landowners to alter their land use. It is described as &quot;a forest in the making&quot; and it is hoped to increase tourism and forestry-related jobs in the area.

Around 9.5 million trees have been planted, more than tripling the woodland cover from 6% to 25%.

==Planting==
Approximately 85% of the trees planted are native broadleaf species. Some of the most commonly planted species are: English oak, ash, poplar, Corsican pine and Scots pine.

The transformation of the landscape is beginning to take effect as the first tiny whips planted in the early 1990s are growing into substantial trees.

==Attractions==

At the centre of the National Forest is &quot;Conkers&quot;, a visitor centre located just outside the village of Moira, Leicestershire.
There is also a visitor centre with wildlife walks and playgrounds at Rosliston.

Other attractions include:

*Ashby Canal
*Ashby Castle, Ashby-de-la-Zouch
*Ashby de-la-Zouch museum, Ashby de-la-Zouch

<text>Martin Osborne Johnson CBE (born 9 March 1970) is an English retired rugby union player who represented and captained England and Leicester in a career spanning 16 seasons. He captained England to victory in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and is regarded as one of the greatest locks ever to have played, and one of England&#x27;s greatest ever players.

Johnson made his debut for Leicester Tigers in 1989 and in 1993 debuted for as well as being a late call up to the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand. He was a try scorer in the final when Leicester won the 1993 Pilkington Cup and a member of the side which won the 1994-95 Courage League. Johnson was an ever-present as England won the Grand Slam in the 1995 Five Nations Championship. In 1997 he was named as captain for the victorious British Lions tour to South Africa, in 2001 he became the first man to captain the Lions twice as he led the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia.

He became England captain in 1999 and led the side in 39 matches, the third most ever. He was captain as England reached the quarter finals of the 1999 Rugby World Cup, won the Grand Slam in the 2003 Six Nations Championship and as England won the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The 2003 Rugby World Cup Final was his 84th and final international match.

During his club career he played 362 games for Leicester, his only senior club, and as well as the cup in 1993 and the league in 1995, he was also captain of the side as they won the 1997 Pilkington Cup and four consecutive Premiership titles between 1999–2002, and became the first side to retain the European Cup, winning in 2001 and 2002. His final season was in 2004–05.

On 1 July 2008 he became the England team manager. Under his management England won the 2011 Six Nations Championship, their first since 2003. He left the post in November 2011 following England&#x27;s quarter final defeat at the 2011 Rugby World Cup and has not taken another management position in the game since.

==Early life==

Johnson was born in Shirley, Solihull, the second of three brothers – his younger brother Will is a former back row forward for Leicester. At the age of seven, his family moved to Market Harborough, Leicestershire, where Martin attended Ridgeway Primary School, Welland Park School and Robert Smyth School.

==Early career==
Johnson briefly played American football for the Leicester Panthers as a tight end or defensive end.

In 1989 he was approached by former All Black Colin Meads to try out for the King Country side in New Zealand. Johnson&#x27;s trial run was successful and he played two seasons for King Country. In 1990 he was even selected for the New Zealand under-21 side which went on a tour of Australia playing a side that included another of the all-time great lock forwards, John Eales.

==Playing career==
===1989-92: Club debut and early seasons===
Johnson made his Leicester debut on 14 February 1989 against the R.A.F. rugby team. His Courage League debut came against champions Bath at Welford Road; Tigers won 15–12 to deny Bath an undefeated season. Johnson did not feature for the first team again until 1990 as he played in New Zealand. His return to the first team was again against Bath; on 15 November 1990, due to an injury to Alex Gissing, Johnson started in the third round of 1990-91 Pilkington Cup and Tigers won, the first cup game that Bath had lost at The Rec since 1982. In 1990, Johnson moved to New Zealand to play for King Country and was selected to play for the Under 21 All Blacks.

A recurrence of a shoulder injury limited Johnson to just 5 games for Leicester in the 1990–91 season, though he did make his divisional debut for the Midlands. Johnson returned to action in August 1991 as Leicester toured Canada, but Gissing was still preferred for the early season club matches. Johnson established himself in the side in early 1991 playing 11 consecutive games from October onward and only missing 5 of the next 26 matches. Although he made his Leicester debut in the same season, 1988–89, as fellow lock Matt Poole, the pair did not start a game together until 5 November 1991 against Cambridge University. They went on to play together 129 times, a club record for a second row partnership.

===1992-93: Cup success, England and Lions debut===

Johnson was now firmly established in Leicester&#x27;s first choice line up. He played every game in the 1992–93 Pilkington Cup as Tigers defeated London Scottish, Nottingham, Exeter and Northampton to set up a final at Twickenham against Harlequins. Johnson scored Leicester&#x27;s second try, after taking the ball from a tap penalty 5 meters out, as Leicester won 23–16.

He made his test debut against in the opening game of the 1993 Five Nations Championship on 16 January 1993. He was due to play in an England &#x27;A&#x27; game when he was unexpectedly summoned to Twickenham to replace the injured Wade Dooley. With only a 20-minute line-out session with his new teammates before the game, Johnson was thrown into the deep end. An early clash of heads with French prop Laurent Seigne left Johnson concussed, but he continued to play as England won 16–15. Johnson did not feature again for England in the Five Nations that season but was called up for an uncapped tour to Canada. After featuring in England&#x27;s loss to Canada he was called up, again as a replacement for Dooley, for the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand. Dooley had returned to England for his father&#x27;s funeral and was blocked from returning to the tour by the Lions&#x27; own committee. Johnson played in the final two tests against New Zealand.

===1993-95: First League title, Grand Slam and Rugby World Cup===
In 1993–94 season Johnson again was an ever-present in Tigers run to the cup final but this time Leicester fell short to rivals Bath, losing 21–9. Leicester were also runners up in the league to Bath, Johnson played in 15 of Leicester&#x27;s 18 matches.

Johnson celebrated the first of his 5 league titles in 1995. That season the league was played in two main blocks with sporadic fixtures in between; the first 9 games were played on consecutive weekends from 10 September 1994 to 5 November 1994, two games were played in January 1995, one in February 1995 and one at the beginning of March 1995 before finishing with 5 games in 6 weeks from 25 March to 29 April. Johnson played in all 9 games in the first period as Tigers won 7, drew against Bath away, and lost to Bristol to leave them 2nd in the table. Against Orrell R.U.F.C. on 14 January 1995 Johnson captained Leicester for the first time, regular captain Dean Richards and vice captain John Wells being unavailable. Tigers won 29–19.

He was ever-present in the England side that won the 1995 Grand Slam. Preparations for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which started in May, were deemed all important so Johnson, along with England colleague Rory Underwood, missed Leicester&#x27;s February league match against Gloucester where Leicester slipped to a second defeat. Johnson returned for the matches against West Hartlepool, which saw Leicester go top, and the crucial wins against Bath and Sale. England duties meant he missed the last game of the season against Bristol which clinched the title.

Johnson was again an ever-present in England&#x27;s 1995 Rugby World Cup Campaign, featuring in group stage wins against , and as well as the quarter final against , the losing semi-final against and the third place play off against .

===1995-97: Professionalism and near misses===

Open professionalism was declared in August 1995, though a moratorium was declared by the RFU until the next season. After interest from Sale, Richmond and Newcastle Johnson signed his first professional contract with Leicester in 1996, a 5-year deal worth &quot;six figures&quot; per year. Johnson gave up his previous career with Midland Bank.

The 1995–96 season had been another of just missing out to perennial rivals Bath. The Somerset side clinched the league on the final day of the season; despite Bath only drawing at home with Sale, Tigers were unable to beat Harlequins at Welford Road, losing 21–19. Leicester&#x27;s full back John Liley had a poor day kicking at goal missing 6 of 9 kicks including a last minute attempt which would have sealed the match, and with it the title. Bath secured a league and cup double after defeating Leicester in the Cup Final. The match is perhaps best remembered for the controversial penalty try awarded by referee Steve Lander for repeated infringement which gave the match to Bath, and after the final whistle Leicester flanker Neil Back pushing Lander to the ground.

The second-place finish in the league did secure Tigers place in the second season of the Heineken Cup, the English clubs were not involved in the first season. Dean Richards was still the club captain in 1996–97 but age and injury limited him to 23 starts, in his place Rory Underwood captained 5 of the first 9 games before Johnson became the regular stand in captain. He led the side in the short lived Anglo-Welsh League against Bridgend then again in Leicester&#x27;s Heineken Cup debut against Leinster at Donnybrook. Johnson was an ever-present in Leicester&#x27;s side as they reached the 1997 Heineken Cup Final in Cardiff; Leicester beat Leinster, Scottish Borders, Pau and Llanelli in the group stage before beating Harlequins (quarter finals) and Toulouse (semi finals) to set up the final against Brive. The match was close at half time, Leicester were behind 8-6 but the French side ran riot in the second half to win 28–9.

That season Johnson captained Leicester in 12 matches including the 1997 Pilkington Cup Final, which Leicester won beating Sale 9–3 in the final. Johnson captained Leicester in the 6th Round against Bath then again in the quarter finals and semi finals.

===Lions Tour 1997===

Johnson was selected to captain the 1997 British Lions tour of South Africa. The Lions convincingly won the first test at Newlands 25–16 with Neil Jenkins kicking five penalties and Matt Dawson and Alan Tait scoring tries. Despite scoring three tries in the second test at Durban, the Springboks suffered from some woeful goal kicking and failed to land any penalties or conversions, while for the Lions Neil Jenkins once again kicked five penalties to level the scores at 15–15 before Jeremy Guscott dropped a goal for an 18–15 lead for the Lions. The Lions then held off a ferocious South African fightback, Lawrence Dallaglio putting in a try-saving tackle, to win the match 18–15 and take the series. The third test at Ellis Park proved a match too far for the Lions squad and they lost 35–16. The tour was seen as a triumph for the Lions management of Fran Cotton (manager), Ian McGeechan (head coach), Jim Telfer (assistant coach) and especially Johnson as captain.

===1997-2000: Domestic Success===

After returning from the victorious 1997 Lions tour Johnson was formally appointed Leicester&#x27;s captain. The season started with the Heineken Cup and Leicester secured a quarter final play off after finishing second in their group containing Leinster, Toulouse and Amatori Milan. Tigers beat the Italian side twice but lost away to Leinster and at home to Toulouse. In the quarter final play off Leicester beat Glasgow 90-19 but lost in the quarter final proper away to Pau. Domestically Tigers were a mixed bag, winning 12, losing 8 and drawing 2 games to finish 4th in the Allied Dunbar Premiership. In February 1998 Johnson&#x27;s predecessor as Leicester captain Dean Richards was appointed as Director of Rugby following Bob Dwyer&#x27;s sacking.

Following a dispute between the English clubs and European Cup organisers there was no English involvement in the 1998–99 Heineken Cup; this led to an expanded Premiership of 14 clubs and 28 games. Tigers started the new season well with a 49–15 win against Harlequins and wins against London Scottish, Northampton and Bedford to see Tigers top the table at the end of September. Losses against Saracens and London Irish in rounds 5 &amp; 7 saw Tigers slip to 3rd in October; Leicester regained the lead in the table after victories against Richmond and West Hartlepool and were never to lose it despite a loss to Wasps two weeks later. Dreams of the double were dashed by Richmond in the quarter finals of the cup, Johnson received a white card (at the time signifying 10 minutes in the sin bin) and during his absence the Londoners scored their two tries in a 15–13 win. The next week Johnson was sin binned again, this time in a league match against closest challengers Northampton, but even with Pat Howard also sin binned and Leicester down to 13 men for a period so outstanding was Johnson&#x27;s play they won 22–15. Mathematically Johnson&#x27;s second English championship title was sealed in the penultimate match of the season away to Newcastle Falcons. Johnson&#x27;s form was such that he was named as the Premiership&#x27;s Player of the Season.

By now appointed England captain, Johnson missed the start of the 1999-2000 Premiership season due to the 1999 Rugby World Cup. He returned in the 7th game of the season a 12-all draw against Newcastle that left Leicester in 4th position. Johnson then missed much of the season, including the start of the Six Nations, with an Achilles tendon injury. Returning to the first team against Bedford in March Johnson captained Leicester in the last 9 games of the league season as Leicester retained their Premiership crown.

===2001 &amp; 2002: European Champion===

Having dominated domestic rugby for the previous two years Leicester were desperate to avenge their 1997 Heineken Cup Final defeat and claim their first European title. Local rivals Northampton Saints had claimed the previous season&#x27;s title with perennial rivals Bath claiming the title in 1998. Tigers were drawn with Pau, Glasgow and Pontypridd in their Heineken Cup pool. Johnson played in the first four games of the group; wins at home to Pau and away to Glasgow before a loss in Wales to Pontypridd that was quickly avenged a week later at Welford Road. On 9 November 2000 Johnson was one of only three then current players named in Leicester&#x27;s &quot;Team of the Century&quot;.

Johnson missed the final two pool games and the quarter final against Swansea due to a 5-week ban picked up against Saracens in the Tetley&#x27;s Bitter Cup quarter final. Domestically Leicester were again top of the table and at this stage 11 points clear of Northampton in second place. The gap was pushed to 18 points on 10 March 2001 when Tigers beat Northampton at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens and Johnson&#x27;s fourth English league title was formally sealed on 17 March 2001.

With the domestic title sealed, Johnson led Leicester into the Heineken Cup semi finals against Gloucester. Leon Lloyd&#x27;s try gave Leicester a 19–15 win, despite Johnson spending time in the sin bin, to set up the final in the Parc des Princes against Stade Francais. In the final Johnson was again sin binned, for punching Christophe Juillet, but Tigers prevailed winning 34–30 to secure the club&#x27;s first continental title. Tigers had won the inaugural Premeriship playoffs the week before so also sealed an unprecedented treble.

Leicester became the first side to retain a European title after beating Munster in 2002. Johnson also led Leicester in retaining their Premiership title. Returning from the 2001 Lions tour Johnson was rested for the first game of the Premiership season and was kept on the bench for a further two games, not making his seasonal debut until 22 September 2001 against Bath. The next two weeks he started Leicester&#x27;s Heineken Cup pool games against Llanelli and Calvisano but shortly after picked up the injury that would keep him out of England&#x27;s rearranged Six Nations game with Ireland.

Johnson returned to fitness to see Leicester through to the Heineken Cup semi finals against Llanelli but as with the season before missed mid-season matches due to a ban picked up in a game against Saracens. The ban was controversial as it was felt that the RFU did not have the right to hold the hearing, the incident having been seen and dealt with by way of a sin bin at the time, and that having then decided to ban Johnson he was only banned for Leicester game becoming available once England&#x27;s games resumed.

Johnson though returned to Leicester after the Six Nations and helped Leicester secure their fourth successive title against Newcastle on 13 April 2002 at Welford Road. Two weeks later Johnson captained Leicester as they traveled to Nottingham&#x27;s City Ground for the Heineken Cup semi final against Llanelli. Tigers won thanks to a Tim Stimpson penalty which hit both the post and the cross bar before going through the posts. Tigers again victorious in the final winning 15–9 against Munster; the match is best remembered for Austin Healey&#x27;s try and Neil Back&#x27;s handling in a last-minute scrum on the Tigers&#x27; line. Though Johnson did have a try of his own ruled out after 10 minutes, with Tigers also having a first minute score from Freddie Tuilagi ruled out.

In 2002 he was the third England captain after John Pullin and Will Carling to lead and beat all of the “Big Three” Southern Hemisphere sides: , and . As captain, he had 4 wins against Australia, 2 against New Zealand, and 5 against South Africa.

===2003 Rugby World Cup and Grand Slam===

The 2003 international season started with the 2003 Six Nations Championship. Johnson featured in four of England&#x27;s five games, wins against France, Wales, Scotland and the Grand Slam decider against Ireland. This success, the first England Grand Slam since 1995 was followed by a successful 2 match tour to New Zealand and Australia. England&#x27;s first match was a 15–13 win over the All Blacks, during which the 6-man England scrum held off sustained pressure to clinch England&#x27;s first win over the All Blacks in New Zealand since 1973. During the match, Johnson famously told his comrades in the scrum to &quot;get down and shove&quot;. When asked about what was going through his head in the scrum he replied &quot;my spine&quot;. In England&#x27;s second match, a 20–17 victory over Australia, Johnson also performed at a monumental level, leading the former Australian captain, John Eales (who retired in 2001), to commend his display as &#x27;among the best ever by a lock forward&#x27;. They took this into the 2003 World Cup, where they won crucial matches against South Africa, Wales and France, beating Australia in the final to win the cup with an extra time drop goal.

===2003-05: Final Seasons===

Johnson continued to play for Leicester until 2005. Leicester struggled after winning the 2002 League and European double, slumping to 6th in the 2002-03 Premiership season. As focus was on Johnson and co. in Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup Leicester&#x27;s troubles continued, finding themselves in 11th place when their world champions returned. Dean Richards was sacked with John Wells his assistant taking charge. Wells led Leicester into 5th and qualification for the 2004–05 Heineken Cup. Johnson announced this was to be his final season along with Neil Back, who was also retiring, and coach Wells, who was leaving Leicester to join the England coaching staff. Tigers topped the table and went straight to the 2005 Premiership Final against Wasps, but lost 39–14. In the European Cup Leicester won away against Leinster in the quarter finals but were defeated by Toulose 27–19 at the Walkers Stadium.

==Awards==
Johnson was awarded the Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1997 following his success in captaining the victorious 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa.

After the 2003 Rugby World Cup victory he was awarded the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2004 New Year honours and was second in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards behind Jonny Wilkinson. Johnson&#x27;s testimonial match and farewell to competitive rugby, held at Twickenham on 4 June 2005, was one of the biggest rugby events of the year. It was historic in another way as the match marked the return of All Blacks legend Jonah Lomu after a recent kidney transplant. Johnson&#x27;s XV defeated Lomu&#x27;s 33–29.

On 24 October 2011, at the IRB Awards in Auckland, Johnson was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame alongside all other Rugby World Cup-winning captains and head coaches from the tournament&#x27;s inception in 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted John Eales).

==England head coach==
In November 2006 it was rumoured the then England head rugby coach, Andy Robinson, was to be sacked and Johnson was one of many names speculated by the press as his replacement. The Rugby Football Union eventually selected Brian Ashton for the role.

Johnson was appointed England team manager in April 2008. England started the 2008 Autumn internationals by beating the Pacific Islands 39–13. That was followed with a loss to Australia, then a 42–6 defeat to South Africa and then another loss this time 32–6 against New Zealand at Twickenham.

England had four wins under Johnson going into 2009; in the 2009 Six Nations Championship they beat Italy 36–11, France 34–10 and Scotland 26–12 but were defeated by Ireland by 14–13 and to Wales by 23–15.

In the 2010 Six Nations England won their first two games against Wales and Italy, losing against Ireland, drawing with Scotland and losing their final game against France, allowing the French to win a Grand Slam.

In 2011, Johnson led a new-look England side to win the 2011 Six Nations title, thanks to wins over Wales, Italy, France and Scotland, though a 24–8 loss to Ireland on the final weekend of the competition denied them the Grand Slam. He resigned on 16 November 2011 following England&#x27;s poor performance on and off the field at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand.

<doc id="315378" wikidata="Q1207707" url="?curid=315378" title="Dhol">
<text>Dhol () can refer to any one of a number of similar types of double-headed drum widely used, with regional variations, throughout the Indian subcontinent. Its range of distribution in Indian subcontinent primarily includes northern areas such as the Jammu, Himachal, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Kashmir, Sindh, Assam Valley, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Konkan, Goa, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. A related instrument is the dholak or dholki. &quot;Dhols&quot; are amongst other events used in Indian wedding ceremony processions such as Baraat or &quot;Varyatra&quot;. 

Someone who plays the dhol is known as &quot;dholi&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word Dhol is derived from Sanskrit word &quot;ḍhola,&quot; a term for drum in Sanskrit language.

== Construction ==
The dhol is a double-sided barrel drum played mostly as an accompanying instrument in regional music forms. In Qawwali music, the term &quot;dhol&quot; is used to describe a similar, but smaller drum with a smaller tabla, as a replacement for the left-hand tabla drum. The typical sizes of the drum vary slightly from region to region. In Punjab, the dhol remains large and bulky to produce the preferred loud bass. In other regions, dhols can be found in varying shapes and sizes, and made with different woods and materials (fiberglass, steel, plastic). The drum consists of a wooden barrel with animal hide or synthetic skin stretched over its open ends, covering them completely. These skins can be stretched or loosened with a tightening mechanism made up of either interwoven ropes, or nuts and bolts. Tightening or loosening the skins subtly alters the pitch of the drum sound. The stretched skin on one of the ends is thicker and produces a deep, low-frequency (higher bass) sound and the other thinner one produces a higher-frequency sound. Dhols with synthetic, or plastic, treble skins are common.

== Playing ==
The dhol is played using two wooden sticks, usually made out of wood, cane, or also known as wickers cane. The stick used to play the bass side of the instrument is known as the &quot;dagga&quot; in Punjabi. Traditionally the Dhol player would go and look for a branch from a hardwood tree known as Tali (oak or mahogany) that was naturally curved at that angle and use this as the Dagga (Bass Stick). The reason for the bend stick is because of the goat skin. This is thin like 80-100gsm paper, so the stick has to be bent to avoid piercing the skin. The bass stick or Dagga is the thicker of the two and is bent in an eighth- or quarter-circular arc on the end that strikes the instrument. The other stick, known as the &quot;teeli&quot;, is much thinner and flexible and used to play the higher note end of the instrument.

The dhol is slung over the shoulder or, more rarely, around the neck of the player with a strap usually made up of woven cotton. The surface of the wooden barrel is in some cases decorated with engraved patterns and sometimes paint.

In the pre-Partition era, dozens of rhythms were played on the Punjabi dhol, which corresponded to specific functions. However, with the decline or disappearance of some cultural practices, recent generations of dhol players have become unfamiliar with many of these. At the same time, the growth of folkloric staged bhangra dance in Punjab inspired the creation of many new rhythms particular to that dance.

Some of the most common Punjabi dhol rhythms are &quot;bhangra&quot; (originating with the old, community bhangra dance), &quot;dhamaal&quot; (associated with many cultural functions, including worship at Sufi shrines), and &quot;kaharva&quot;, a dance and song rhythm. The staged &quot;bhangra&quot; dance, originating in the 1950s, gave special prominence to &quot;kaharva&quot;, for the performance of actions called &quot;luddi&quot;. In the 1970s, many more actions were added to staged bhangra to go with the kaharva rhythm, which started to become one of the most prominent rhythms associated with the dance. At the same time, this type of rhythm would be played on the dholki drum to accompany Punjabi songs. So when, in the 1990s, Punjabi pop songs began to evoke bhangra dance, they used the kaharva rhythm. It is known now by various names. Some dhol players call it &quot;kaharva&quot;, its technical name, while other players in Punjab call it &quot;luddi&quot; to refer to the dance of that name. With the style of dhol-playing that developed in the U.K., the name &quot;chaal&quot; was adopted, probably in reference to the &quot;chaal&quot; (movements) it accompanies in modern bhangra. However, that term is not used elsewhere. Johnny Kalsi is a UK Dhol player that established a syllabus to teach the art of playing this instrument. Although there is no official syllabus or phrasing for the learning process, he took the North Indian language of Tabla to visualise the beats as phonetic phrases to make learning easier.

The introduction of electronic devices such as tape recorders has led to a decline in the importance of dhol players in celebratory events. Nevertheless, dhol music still figures in the studio recordings of present-day raas, garba and bhangra music artists.

== History ==

Shail Vyas claims several percussion instruments such as the Dhol maybe came from the influence of some clay-made instruments that are similar to the Dhol, which are found in Indus Valley Civilisation. Dhol is depicted in earliest ancient Indian sculptural arts as one of the chief percussion instruments for ancient Indian music along with tabla. Ain-i-Akbari, describes the use of Dhol in the orchestra of the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great. The Indo-Aryan word &quot;dhol&quot; appears in print around 1800 in the treatise &quot;Sangitasara&quot;.

== Regional forms and traditions ==
=== The Punjab region ===

The Punjabi dhol is used in the Punjab region of Pakistan and northern India. In Pakistan, the dhol is mostly played in the Punjab region; however, it is also used throughout the country ranging from as far south as Karachi and as far north as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In India it is found in the states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi. The beats of dhol have been an element in the ceremonies of the great Sufi mystics and their followers. The patterns of dhol have been developed to catalyze the mind of the devotee who is seeking spiritual trance. 

=== Assam ===

In Assam, the dhol is widely used in &quot;Rongali Bihu&quot; (&quot;Bohag Bihu&quot;), the Assamese new year celebrations in the month of April. Celebrated in mid-April every year (usually on 14 or 13 April according to the Assamese traditional calendar), the dhol is an important and a quintessential instrument used in Bihu dance. The origin of the Dhol in Assam dates back to at least the 14th century when it was referred in Assamese Buranjis as being played by the indigenous people. This shows that the origin of Dhol in Assam was much older than the rest of India, and the name was probably due to sanskritisation. The people of the Valley reckon that the beats of the &quot;dhol&quot; are enchanting for people even at a long distance. Played by using a bamboo stick with bare hands, the Assamese dhol is made up of a wooden barrel with the ends covered primarily with animal hide (unlike the rest of the Indian subcontinent, where it could be a synthetic skin as well), that can either be stretched or loosened by tightening the interwoven straps. The dhol player is termed &quot;Dhulia&quot; and the expert in dhol is termed &quot;Ojah&quot; (Assamese: ওজা).

The Khol a kind of dhol also has an aspect of symbolism in Assamese culture, and one considers it to be a &quot;devo badyo&quot; (Assamese: দেৱ বাদ্য) or &quot; an instrument of god&quot; believed to be brought to Earth by the Pandavas.

=== Goa ===
Dhol (which is always accompanied by &quot;tasha&quot;, cymbals, etc.) is an important part of Goan &quot;shigmo&quot; celebrations. It also is an important part of Goan temple music; the temple dhol was traditionally played by a specific caste.

=== Gujarat ===

The dhol was used by Gujaratis during celebrations such as Navaratri to accompany garba. Garba are the folk songs which describe the grace of the divine mother. It is one of the important musical instruments in Gujarat.

=== Maharashtra ===
In Maharashtra, dhol is a primary instrument used in Ganesh festivals. In the city of Pune, locals come together to form dhol pathaks (troupes). Pune supposedly has the largest number of dhols in India. In the city of Nagpur, there are many troupes that play dhol on festivals and other occasions. Here dhol is referred to as &#x27;Sandhal&#x27;. Dhol is made up of two stretched membranes tied by a strong string. One side of the dhol is played by wooden stick called &quot;tiparu&quot;, on that side black coloured ink paste stick in the centre. This membrane is called the &quot;dhum&quot;. In technical language, it is called base. Another side of dhol is called &quot;thapi&quot; or &quot;chati&quot;. In technical language, it is called as tremer, this side of membrane is only played by palm. Boll of the dhol is &quot;Taa&quot;, &quot;Dhin&quot; and &quot;Dha&quot;. &quot;Taa&quot; for the &quot;Thapi&quot; side, &quot;Dhin&quot; for the &quot;Dhum&quot; side and &quot;Dha&quot; for both sides played together.

=== Karnataka ===
Called &quot;Dhollu&quot; in Kannada, the folk dance is known as Dollu Kunitha -Kunitha meaning dance. The folk art is mainly preserved and performed by the people of the Kuruba community of Karnataka.

===Uttarakhand===
In the Garhwal region, specific musical caste groups like the &quot;auji&quot;, &quot;das&quot; or &quot;dholi&quot; have historically played the dhol and damau, the two folk instruments of the region, at special occasions or religious festivals according to the Dhol Sagar, an ancient treatise that was transmitted orally and by practical teaching.

=== West Bengal ===
The &quot;dhak&quot; (Bengali: ঢাক) is a huge membranophone instrument from India. The shapes differ from almost cylindrical to the barrel. The manner of stretching the hide over the mouths and lacing also varies. It is suspended from the neck, tied to the waist and kept on the lap or the ground, and usually played with wooden sticks. The left side is coated to give it a heavier sound.

Drum beats are an integral part of Durga Puja. It is mostly played by the Bengali community.

=== Pashtun areas ===
The dhol is the main musical instrument in the Pashtun dance known as &quot;attan&quot;. The Afghan and Iranian Dohol is not the same drum on the Indian subcontinent.

=== Caucasus ===
Caucasian dhol is called dhol in Armenia, dholi or doli in Georgia and Abkhazia, and doul in North Caucasus.

=== In global culture ===
It has become popular in other parts of the world due to Indian diaspora and diaspora from the Indian subcontinent. Dhol has been a popular musical instrument in formal and informal dance performances for decades.

<text>Simon Arthur Noël Raven (28 December 1927 – 12 May 2001) was an English author, playwright, essayist, television writer, and screenwriter. He is known for his louche lifestyle as much as for his literary output.

Expelled from Charterhouse School, he was commissioned in the infantry in National service, before studying at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Unable to earn a living as a writer, he rejoined the Army, but soon resigned, rather than be court-martialled for &#x27;conduct unbecoming&#x27; on account of his gambling debts.

Declaring that he wrote only for people who shared his own standards, he never attracted the mass market, and had to be rescued by publisher Anthony Blond, who paid him a regular wage on condition that he stayed out of London and concentrated on his writings, many of which Blond published. The arrangement lasted for over 30 years.

Raven is remembered for his ten-novel sequence &quot;Alms for Oblivion&quot; and its baroque, supernatural sequels &quot;The Roses of Picardie&quot; and &quot;September Castle&quot;; as well as &quot;The Feathers of Death&quot;, an exploratory early army novel dealing with homosexuality between officers and &quot;other ranks&quot;. He also wrote scripts for the television drama series &quot;The Pallisers&quot; (1974) and &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot; (1978).

==Biography==

===Birth, family and education===
Born on 28 December 1927 in London, he was the eldest of three children. His father, Arthur Raven, had inherited a fortune from the family&#x27;s hosiery business, and lived a life of leisure. His mother Esther, née Christmas, a baker&#x27;s daughter, was a distance and cross-country athlete who represented England against France in March 1932. He was educated first at Cordwalles preparatory school near Camberley, Surrey, then as a scholarship pupil at Charterhouse, whence he was expelled in 1945 for homosexual activities. Amongst his school contemporaries were James Prior, William Rees-Mogg, Oliver Popplewell and Peter May. After completing national service he entered King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1948, to read classics.

Although he possessed a first-class intelligence, this was not matched by his application, and his university career was punctuated by regular crises over money, misbehaviour and an apparent inability – or, more likely, unwillingness – to connect actions with their consequences. His intelligence garnered him only an upper second, a degree which would not normally have gained him a studentship to read for a doctorate. That it did so may be attributed, essentially, to his personal charm, which gained him credit with the Fellows responsible for awarding scholarships. He was awarded a studentship (graduate fellowship) to study the influence of the classics in Victorian schooling, but this soon gave way to pleasure-seeking and his thesis was never seriously addressed. In 1951, he married Susan Kilner, a graduate from Newnham who was expecting his child; the marriage was from duty, as he made clear, and afterwards, he studiously avoided her. A son, Adam, was born in 1952. (The couple divorced in 1957.) Raven, his scholarship funds exhausted, withdrew from King&#x27;s, and attempted to earn a living as a writer, gaining a small income as book reviewer for &quot;The Listener&quot;. He also wrote a novel, which proved unpublishable because of its libellous nature, and only emerged almost 30 years later as &quot;An Inch of Fortune&quot;. Seeking a firmer livelihood, Raven decided to rejoin the British Army.

===Army===
During his earlier National Service, Raven had briefly served as an officer cadet in the Parachute Regiment, and in 1947 was on a posting in India, during the final months of British rule there. He was subsequently commissioned into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, before being seconded to the 77th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery at Rollestone Balloon Camp in Wiltshire, where he saw out his service. In 1953, after university, he secured a regular commission with the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI), serving in West Germany and Kenya, before receiving a home posting to Shrewsbury. It was during this period, when he was still married to Susan, that he sent his notorious telegram to her in response to her telegraphic plea for money: &quot;Sorry no money, suggest eat baby&quot;. Such a callous response suggests that he cared nothing for his wife and child, although in fact he diligently provided for Adam&#x27;s education and welfare. During his Shrewsbury posting he gambled heavily at local race meetings, and he was soon in severe financial straits following a &quot;disastrous sequence of slow horses&quot;. Faced with the prospect of a court-martial for &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot; he was allowed to resign quietly, to avoid scandal in the regiment. This episode he later described with candour in &quot;Shadows on the Grass&quot;.

===Writing career===
At almost 30 years of age he had no career or prospects, but from his studies of the classics he had developed a lucid writing style, derived, as he said, from the Army&#x27;s admirable instruction to be &quot;brief, neat and plain&quot;. This, allied to his ready and disrespectful wit, was allowing him to survive precariously in journalism when, in 1958, he was employed by publisher Anthony Blond: &quot;I had picked him up through Hugh Thomas who was editing a symposium for me, called &quot;The Establishment&quot;. Simon was billed to do the piece on the Army&quot;. Blond financed him while he wrote his first published novel, &quot;The Feathers of Death&quot; (1959). Blond was impressed enough to offer him a contract to continue writing for him, on condition he lived away from London, and paid off Raven&#x27;s debts. &quot;This is the last hand-out you get&quot;, he was told. &quot;Leave London, or leave my employ&quot;. He moved to lodgings in Deal, Kent, and was paid (reportedly) a £15 wage by Blond. As a consequence of this arrangement, during the remainder of his working life, Raven became one of Britain&#x27;s most prolific writers in a range of genres including fiction, essays, personal reminiscences, polemics, theatre, screenplays and magazine journalism. He was at various times compared with Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, Anthony Powell and Lawrence Durrell, but his voice was his own: &quot;Raven came nearer than other novelists to exposing, in the grandeur of its squalor and the dubiety of its standards, the times he lived in and saw through&quot;. His own view of his craft was less exalted; in the words of his writer-character Fielding Gray in the novel &quot;Places Where They Sing&quot; (1970): &quot;I arrange words in pleasing patterns in order to make money&quot;.

He had a fascination for the supernatural, first manifested in his early novel &quot;Doctors Wear Scarlet&quot;, which features Balkan vampires (though they are practitioners of vampirism as a sexual deviation rather than an actual supernatural manifestation) and was cited by Karl Edward Wagner as one of the thirteen best supernatural novels. The Gothic themes became stronger in later works such as &quot;The Roses of Picardie&quot;, &quot;September Castle&quot;, parts of the &quot;First-Born of Egypt&quot; sequence, and the 1994 novella &quot;The Islands of Sorrow&quot;.

Although he acquired an enthusiastic and loyal following, he was never a top-seller in terms of the mass market. Quoted by Brooke Allen: &quot;I&#x27;ve always written for a small audience of people like myself, who are well-educated, worldly, sceptical and snobbish (meaning that they rank good taste over bad)&quot;.

His ten-novel sequence &quot;Alms for Oblivion&quot; is usually regarded as his best achievement – A. N. Wilson thought it &quot;the jolliest roman-fleuve&quot; – though it is likely that he gained wider public recognition for his TV work, especially the adaptation of &quot;The Pallisers&quot; (1974) and &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot; (1978). As he grew older his rate of output lessened, and there was deterioration in its quality, but he was still being published in the late 1990s, his last book being &quot;Remember Your Grammar and Other Haunted Stories&quot; (1997), a collection of ghost and supernatural short stories.

Raven&#x27;s book of anecdotes and reminiscences, &quot;Is there anybody there? said the Traveller&quot; (Frederick Muller 1990) was withdrawn after a series of libel action threats, including a writ from Anthony Blond. Thereafter he planned, or at least threatened, to write a new work &quot;All Safely Dead&quot;, in which, safe from the laws of libel, he could &quot;expose&quot; various deceased luminaries from the British social, academic, political and literary scenes, but the book was never written.

===Later life===
Throughout his life, Raven pursued a hedonistic lifestyle which included eating, drinking, travel, cricket, gambling and socialising. He spent what he earned, and after 34 years in Kent at Blond&#x27;s behest he finally moved to London on securing lodgings in the London Charterhouse, the almshouse historically associated with Charterhouse School. Here he led a quieter version of his former life. In 1993, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. A biography of Raven, &quot;The Captain&quot;, written by Michael Barber, was published in 1996. In 1997, he appeared with Melvyn Bragg in a &quot;South Bank Show&quot; devoted to his career, in good spirits and without regrets. His health continued to fail, however, and after a series of strokes he died in London on 12 May 2001, aged 73.

==Legacy==

Raven&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed that, &quot;he combined elements of Flashman, Waugh&#x27;s Captain Grimes and the Earl of Rochester&quot;, and that he reminded Noel Annan, his Cambridge tutor, of the young Guy Burgess.

Among the many things said about him, perhaps the most quoted was that he had &quot;the mind of a cad and the pen of an angel&quot;. E. W. Swanton called Raven&#x27;s cricket memoir &quot;Shadows on the Grass&quot; &quot;the filthiest cricket book ever written&quot;. Typically, Raven&#x27;s response to this was to ask Swanton&#x27;s permission to quote this opinion on the book&#x27;s jacket. He has also been called &quot;cynical&quot; and &quot;cold-blooded&quot;, his characters &quot;guaranteed to behave badly under pressure; most of them are vile without any pressure at all&quot;. His unashamed credo was &quot;a robust eighteenth-century paganism ... allied to a deep contempt for the egalitarian code of post-war England&quot;.

==List of works==

===Novels===

====Early novels====

* Note: His first novel, &quot;An Inch of Fortune&quot;, written circa 1951, was not published until 1980

====&quot;Alms for Oblivion&quot; series====

The 10 novels cover the period 1945 to 1973 and centre on a group of upper and upper middle class characters, forming a novel sequence, if a somewhat loosely structured one. The early novels are robust satires of the English upper set of the mid-1950s, but the later tend to a more detached and philosophical tone, becoming concerned with the occult and supernatural, and including strange happenings.

====&quot;The First-Born of Egypt&quot; series====

This sequence is a continuation of &quot;Alms for Oblivion&quot;, with many of the same characters, but with storylines tending to centre on the &quot;next generation&quot; and the introduction of darker, mystic themes. These books were written strictly for money, and received little critical acclaim, but Raven had fun killing off many of the survivors from the earlier sequence, usually in absurd and/or humiliating circumstances.

====Other novels====
===Essays, reminiscences and polemics===

Note: &quot;The English Gentleman&quot; was also published as &quot;The Decline of the Gentleman&quot;

===Other writings===

(this table is not necessarily complete)
He also wrote features and articles for: &quot;The Listener&quot;; &quot;Encounter&quot;; &quot;London Magazine&quot;; &quot;Spectator&quot;; &quot;New Statesman&quot; and other magazines and journals

===Plays, screenplays, TV and film adaptations===

====Selected plays====

*&quot;Royal Foundation and Other Plays&quot;, Anthony Blond 1966

====Selected screenplays, TV and film adaptations====
Note: The US title for &quot;Incense of the Damned&quot; was: &quot;Bloodsuckers&quot;

<text>The Gran Telescopio Canarias (GranTeCan or GTC) is a reflecting telescope located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, in the Canary Islands, Spain. It is the world&#x27;s largest single-aperture optical telescope.

Construction of the telescope took seven years and cost €130 million. Its installation was hampered by weather conditions and the logistical difficulties of transporting equipment to such a remote location. First light was achieved in 2007 and scientific observations began in 2009.

The GTC Project is a partnership formed by several institutions from Spain and Mexico, the University of Florida, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC). Planning for the construction of the telescope, which started in 1987, involved more than 1,000 people from 100 companies. The division of telescope time reflects the structure of its financing: 90% Spain, 5% Mexico and 5% the University of Florida.

==History==

=== First light ===
The GTC began its preliminary observations on 13 July 2007, using 12 segments of its primary mirror, made of Zerodur glass-ceramic by the German company Schott AG. Later, the number of segments was increased to a total of 36 hexagonal segments fully controlled by an active optics control system, working together as a reflective unit. Its first instrument was the Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS). Scientific observations began in May 2009.

=== Inauguration ceremony ===
The Gran Telescopio Canarias formally opened its shutters on July 24, 2009, inaugurated by King Juan Carlos I of Spain. More than 500 astronomers, government officials and journalists from Europe and the Americas attended the ceremony.
==MEGARA==
MEGARA (Multi-Espectrografo en GTC de Alta Resolucion para Astronomia) is an optical integral-field and multi-object spectrograph covering the visible light and near infrared wavelength range between 0.365 and 1 μm with a spectral resolution in the range R=6000–20000. The MEGARA IFU (also called the Large Compact Bundle, or LCB) offers a contiguous field of view of 12.5 arcsec x 11.3 arcsec, while the multi-object spectroscopy mode allows 92 objects to be observed simultaneously in a field of view of 3.5 arcmin x 3.5 arcmin by means of an equal number of robotic positioners. Both the LCB and MOS modes make use of 100 μm-core optical fibers (1267 in total) that are attached to a set of microlens arrays (with 623 spaxels in the case of the LCB and 92 x 7 in the case of the MOS) with each microlens covering an hexagonal region of 0.62 arcsec in diameter.

== CanariCam ==
The University of Florida&#x27;s CanariCam was a mid-infrared imager with spectroscopic, coronagraphic, and polarimetric capabilities. Since 2012, it had been operating in queue mode at one of the Nasmyth focus stations, until it was temporarily decommissioned in April 2016. Following an upgrade project, started in mid-2018, it was installed and recommissioned (December 2019) on a different folded-Cassegrain focus providing superior performance with the instrument.

CanariCam is designed as a diffraction-limited imager. It is optimized as an imager, and although it offered a range of other observing modes, these did not compromise the imaging capability. CanariCam worked in the thermal infrared between approximately 7.5 and 25 μm. At the short-wavelength end, the cut-off was determined by the atmosphere—specifically atmospheric seeing. At the long wavelength end, the cut-off was determined by the detector; this loses sensitivity beyond around 24 μm, although the cut-off for individual detectors varied significantly. CanariCam was a very compact design. It was designed for a total weight of the cryostat and its on-telescope electronics to be under 400 kg. Most previous mid-infrared instruments have used liquid helium as a cryogen; one of the requirements of CanariCam was that it should require no expensive and difficult to handle cryogens.

CanariCam used a two-stage closed cycle cryocooler system to cool the cold optics and cryostat interior to approximately , and the detector itself to around , the temperature at which the detector worked most efficiently. CanariCam was decommissioned .

==OSIRIS==
The IAC&#x27;s OSIRIS (Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy), is an imager and spectrograph covering wavelengths from 0.365 to 1.05 μm. It has a field of view (FOV) of 7 × 7 arcmin for direct imaging, and 8 arcmin × 5.2 arcmin for low resolution spectroscopy. For spectroscopy, it offers tunable filters.

<text>Walter Stone Tevis Jr. (; February 28, 1928 – August 9, 1984) was an American novelist and screenwriter. Three of his six novels were adapted into major films: &quot;The Hustler&quot;, &quot;The Color of Money&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;. A fourth, &quot;The Queen’s Gambit&quot;, was adapted into a miniseries with the same title and shown on Netflix in 2020. His books have been translated into at least 18 languages.

==Life and career==
Tevis was born in San Francisco, California, in 1928 to Anna Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; (née Bacon) and Walter Stone Tevis, an appraiser, growing up in the Sunset District, across the street from Golden Gate Park. His sister, Betty, was born in 1925.

He developed a rheumatic heart condition, so his parents placed him in the Stanford Children&#x27;s Convalescent home (and given heavy doses of phenobarbital), for a year, during which time they returned to Kentucky, where the Tevis family had been given an early land grant in Madison County. Walter traveled across country alone by train at age 11 to rejoin his family in Kentucky. He made friends with Toby Kavanaugh, a fellow high school student, and learned to shoot pool in the Kavanaugh mansion in Lawrenceburg. In the library there, he read science fiction for the first time. They remained lifelong friends. Kavanaugh later became the owner of a pool room in Lexington, which would have an impact on Tevis&#x27;s writing.

Tevis joined the Navy on his seventeenth birthday. He became a carpenter&#x27;s mate, serving on the &quot;USS Hamul&quot; in Okinawa.

After his discharge, he graduated from Model Laboratory School in Kentucky in 1945. He entered the University of Kentucky, where he received B.A. (1949) and M.A. (1954) degrees in English literature and studied with A. B. Guthrie Jr., the author of &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. While a student there, Tevis worked in a pool hall and published a story about pool written for Guthrie&#x27;s class. He later attended the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, where he received an MFA in creative writing in 1960.

After graduation, Tevis wrote for the Kentucky Highway Department. He taught classes in fields from the sciences and English to physical education in small-town Kentucky high schools in Science Hill, Hawesville, Irvine, and Carlisle. He also taught at Northern Kentucky University, the University of Kentucky, and Southern Connecticut State University.

Tevis taught English literature and creative writing at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, from 1965 to 1978, where he was named University Professor. Tevis was a member of the Authors Guild.

==Career==

===Short stories===
Tevis wrote more than two dozen short stories for a variety of magazines. &quot;The Big Hustle,&quot; his pool hall story for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; (August 5, 1955), was illustrated by Denver Gillen. It was followed by short stories in &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, &quot;Bluebook&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

===Novels===
His first novel, &quot;The Hustler&quot;, was published by Harper &amp; Row in 1959. Tevis followed it with &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, published in 1963. Tevis drew from elements of his childhood in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, as noted by James Sallis, writing in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;:

During his time teaching at Ohio University, Tevis became aware that the level of literacy among students was falling at an alarming rate. That observation gave him the idea for &quot;Mockingbird&quot; (1980), set in a grim and decaying New York City in the 25th century. The population is declining, no one can read, and robots rule over the drugged, illiterate humans. With the birth rate dropping, the end of the species seems a possibility. Tevis was a nominee for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1980 for &quot;Mockingbird&quot;. During one of his last televised interviews, he revealed that PBS once planned a production of &quot;Mockingbird&quot; as a follow-up to their 1979 film of Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;.

Tevis also wrote &quot;The Steps of the Sun&quot; (1983), &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Color of Money&quot; (1984), a sequel to &quot;The Hustler&quot;. His short stories were collected in &quot;Far from Home&quot; in 1981.

====Adaptations====
Three of Tevis&#x27;s six novels were adapted for major motion pictures, and one for a TV mini-series. &quot;The Hustler&quot;, directed by Robert Rossen, and &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese, followed the escapades of fictional pool hustler &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson. &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, directed by Nicolas Roeg, was released in 1976; it was subsequently re-made in 1987 as a TV film, and in 2022 as a TV series. &quot;The Queen’s Gambit&quot; is a 2020 Netflix mini-series starring Anya Taylor-Joy.

==Personal life==
Tevis married Jamie Griggs in 1957, and they remained together for over twenty years before getting divorced. They had two children, a son, William Thomas, and daughter, Julia Ann.

Tevis was a frequent smoker, gambler and alcoholic, and his works often included these vices as central themes. Tevis took some of the money he earned from the movie rights to &quot;The Hustler&quot; and moved his family to Mexico, where he later claimed that he &quot;stayed drunk for eight months.&quot; When Tevis was drinking, he couldn&#x27;t write. According to his son Will, &quot;[Walter Tevis] is the [anti-]hero of all his own books.&quot; Having a heart condition, Tevis was given phenobarbital at a young age. This is considered part of the inspiration for the character Beth Harmon in &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, and according to Tevis, part of the reason for his later alcoholism. Tevis was able to overcome his alcohol habit in the 1970s with help from Alcoholics Anonymous.

Tevis spent his last years in New York City as a full-time writer, where he died of lung cancer in 1984. He was buried in Richmond, Kentucky.

In 2003, Jamie Griggs Tevis published her autobiography, &quot;My Life with the Hustler&quot;. She died on August 4, 2006.

In 1983, Tevis married Eleanora Walker, later the trustee of the Walter Tevis Copyright Trust. She died December 9, 2016, at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, in an apparent suicide. Walter Tevis&#x27;s literary output is represented by the Susan Schulman Literary Agency.

<text>The Rotes Rathaus (, &quot;Red City Hall&quot;) is the town hall of Berlin, Germany, located in the Mitte district on Rathausstraße near Alexanderplatz. It is the home to the governing mayor and the government (the Senate of Berlin) of the state of Berlin. The name of the landmark building dates from the façade design with red clinker bricks.

==History==
The Rathaus was built between 1861 and 1869 in the style of the Northern Italy High Renaissance by Hermann Friedrich Waesemann. It was modelled on the Old Town Hall of Thorn (today Toruń, Poland), while the architecture of the tower is reminiscent of the cathedral tower of Notre-Dame de Laon in France. It replaced several individual buildings dating from the Middle Ages and now occupies an entire city block.

The building was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in World War II and rebuilt to the original plans between 1951 and 1956. The &quot;Neues Stadthaus&quot;, which survived the bombing and had formerly been the head office of Berlin&#x27;s municipal fire insurance &quot;Feuersozietät&quot; in Parochialstraße served as the temporary city hall for the post-war city government for all the sectors of Berlin until September 1948. Following that time, it housed only those of the Soviet sector. The reconstructed Rotes Rathaus, then located in the Soviet sector, served as the town hall of East Berlin, while the Rathaus Schöneberg was the town hall of West Berlin. &quot;Rotes Rathaus&quot; (&quot;red city hall&quot;) was also used figuratively to designate the socialist government of East Berlin, the Magistrat. After German reunification, the administration of reunified Berlin officially moved into the Rotes Rathaus on 1 October 1991.

Its most notable feature is that it gives the original developer of Mozilla (Netscape, now a subsidiary of AOL), the right to distribute modifications made by other contributors under whatever terms it desires, including proprietary terms, without granting similar rights to these other contributors in respect to contributions made by the original developer. This allowed the release of the Netscape 6 and later versions as proprietary software.

This asymmetry with respect to rights has led to criticism of the license by many members of the open source and free software movements: the Free Software Foundation acknowledged it as a free-software license but one to be avoided, and the Open Source Initiative either rejected it entirely or was not asked to review it. The FSF adds that it&#x27;s not possible to combine software obtained under the license with software obtained under the GPL.

The Mozilla Public License version 1.1 is similar (and has limited &quot;file-level copyleft&quot;), but lacks the asymmetry in rights.

<doc id="315407" wikidata="Q27215" url="?curid=315407" title="Black tern">
<text>The black tern (Chlidonias niger) is a small tern generally found in or near inland water that breeds in Europe, Western Asia and North America. In winter the birds migrate to coastal areas of Africa and South America.

==Taxonomy==
The black tern was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Sterna nigra&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type location as Europe but it is now restricted to Uppsala in Sweden. The black tern is now one of four species placed in the genus &quot;Chlidonias&quot; that was introduced in 1822 by the French naturalist Constantine Rafinesque. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;khelidonios&quot;, &quot;swallow-like&quot;, from &quot;khelidon&quot;, &quot;swallow&quot;: another old English name for the black tern is &quot;carr (i.e. lake) swallow&quot;. The species name is from Latin &quot;niger&quot; &quot;shining black&quot;. As its name suggests, it has predominantly dark plumage. In some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season, hence the old English name &quot;blue darr&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised. These are listed below with their breeding ranges.
== Description ==

Adults are long, with a wingspan , and weigh . They have short dark legs and a short, weak-looking black bill, measuring , nearly as long as the head. The bill is long, slender, and looks slightly decurved. They have a dark grey back, with a white forewing, black head, neck (occasionally suffused with grey in the adult) and belly, black or blackish-brown cap (which unites in color with the ear coverts, forming an almost complete hood), and a light brownish-grey, &#x27;square&#x27; tail. The face is white. There is a big dark triangular patch in front of the eye, and a broadish white collar in juveniles. There are greyish-brown smudges on the ides of the white breast, a downwards extension of the plumage of the upperparts. These marks vary in size and are not conspicuous. In non-breeding plumage, most of the black, apart from the cap, is replaced by grey. The plumage of the upperparts is drab, with pale feather-edgings. The rump is brownish-grey.

The North American race, &quot;C. n. surinamensis&quot;, is distinguishable from the European form in all plumages, and is considered by some to be a separate species.

In flight, the build appears slim. The wing-beats are full and dynamic, and flight is often erratic as it dives to the surface for food; similar to other tern species.

Its call has been described as a high-pitched &quot;kik&quot;; the sound of a large flock has been called &quot;deafening&quot;.

== Hybridisation with white-winged tern ==

Hybridisation between this species and white-winged tern has been recorded from Sweden and the Netherlands. Two juvenile birds at Chew Valley Lake, England, in September 1978 and September 1981, were also believed to be hybrids; they showed mixed characters of the two species, specifically a combination of a dark mantle (a feature of white-winged black) with dark patches on the breast-side (a feature of black tern, not shown by white-winged black).

== Distribution and habitat ==
Their breeding habitat is freshwater marshes across most of Canada, the northern United States and much of Europe and western Asia. They usually nest either on floating material in a marsh or on the ground very close to water, laying 2–4 eggs.

In England the black tern was abundant in the eastern Fens, especially in Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, until the early nineteenth century. The Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, describing a visit made to Lincolnshire in 1769, referred to &#x27;vast flocks&#x27; of black terns that &#x27;almost deafen one with their clamors&#x27;. Extensive drainage of its breeding grounds wiped out the English population by about 1840. Intermittent attempts by the black tern to recolonise England have proved unsuccessful, with only a handful of English breeding records, and one in Ireland, in the second half of the twentieth century.

North American black terns migrate to the coasts of northern South America, some to the open ocean. Old World birds winter in Africa.
Unlike the &quot;white&quot; &quot;Sterna&quot; terns, these birds do not dive for fish, but forage on the wing picking up items at or near the water&#x27;s surface or catching insects in flight. They mainly eat insects and fish as well as amphibians.

=== Vagrancy ===
The American race has occurred as a vagrant in Britain and in Ireland.

== Conservation ==
The North American population has declined in recent times due to loss of habitat.

The black tern is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="315411" wikidata="Q213147" url="?curid=315411" title="Korean Air">
<text>Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd. (KAL; , ) is the flag carrier of South Korea and its largest airline based on fleet size, international destinations, and international flights. It is owned by the Hanjin Group.

The present-day Korean Air traces its history to March 1, 1969, when the Hanjin group acquired government-owned Korean Air Lines, which had operated since June 1962. Korean Air is a founding member of SkyTeam alliance and SkyTeam Cargo. As of 2024, it is one of the 10 airlines ranked 5-star airline by Skytrax, and the top 20 airlines in the world in terms of passengers carried and is also one of the top-ranked international cargo airlines.

Korean Air&#x27;s international passenger division and related subsidiary cargo division together serve 126 cities in 44 countries. Its domestic division serves 13 destinations. The airline&#x27;s global headquarters is located in Seoul, South Korea. The airline had approximately 20,540 employees as of December 2014.

The airline was, around 1999, known as &quot;an industry pariah, notorious for fatal crashes&quot; due to its poor safety record and a large number of incidents and accidents. The airline&#x27;s reputation has significantly improved by 2009 as it has focused investment on improving its safety record including by hiring consultants from Boeing and Delta Air Lines.

In November 2020, it was announced that Korean Air would merge with competitor Asiana Airlines, but was switched to only acquire a major stake after the original merger plan was blocked by the United States Department of Justice for monopoly concerns, the acquisition was completed on December 12, 2024.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
In 1962, government of the Republic of Korea acquired Korean National Airlines, which was founded in 1946, and changed its name to Korean Air Lines to become a state-owned airline. On 1 March 1969, the Hanjin Group acquired the state-owned airline and it is the beginning of Korean Air. Long-haul trans-pacific freight operations were introduced on April 26, 1971, followed by passenger services to Los Angeles International Airport on April 19, 1972.

=== Expansion ===
Korean Air operated international flights to destinations such as Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, and Los Angeles with Boeing 707s until the introduction of the Boeing 747 in 1973. That year, the airline introduced Boeing 747s on its trans-Pacific routes and started a European service to Paris, France using the 707 and then McDonnell Douglas DC-10. In 1975, the airline became one of the earliest Asian airlines to operate Airbus aircraft with the purchase of three Airbus A300s, which were put into immediate service on Asian routes. In 1981, Korean Air opened its cargo terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. Since South Korean aircraft were prohibited from flying in the airspace of North Korea and the Soviet Union at the time, the European routes had to be designed eastbound from South Korea, such as Seoul ~ Anchorage ~ Paris.

=== Change to &#x27;Korean Air&#x27; ===
A blue-top, silver and redesigned livery with a new corporate &quot;Korean Air&quot; logo featuring a stylized Taegeuk design was introduced on March 1, 1984, and the airline&#x27;s name changed to Korean Air from Korean Air Lines. This livery was introduced on its MD-80s and Boeing 747-300s. It was designed in cooperation between Korean Air and Boeing. In the 1990s, Korean Air became the first airline to use the new McDonnell Douglas MD-11 to supplement its new fleet of Boeing 747-400 aircraft; however, the MD-11 did not meet the airline&#x27;s performance requirements and they were eventually converted to freighters. Some older 747 aircraft were also converted for freight service. In 1984, Korean Air&#x27;s head office was in the KAL Building on Namdaemunno, Jung District, Seoul.

=== Checkered safety culture and record ===
Korean Air was once notorious for its abysmal safety record and high rate of fatal crashes. In 1999, Korea&#x27;s President Kim Dae-jung described the airline&#x27;s safety record as &quot;an embarrassment to the nation&quot; and chose Korean Air&#x27;s smaller rival, Asiana, for a flight to the United States.

Between 1970 and 1999, Korean Air wrote off 16 aircraft due to serious incidents and accidents with the loss of over 700 lives. In the case of Korean Air Flight 801, the National Transportation Safety Board unanimously concluded that the airline&#x27;s inadequate pilot training contributed to the pilot error that caused the fatal crash.

In 1999, Delta Air Lines suspended its code-sharing relationship with Korean Air explicitly citing its poor safety record following the fatal crash of Korean Air Cargo Flight 6316. It marked the first time safety was explicitly cited as the reason for stopping a major code-sharing alliance by an airline. Other partners including Air Canada and Air France followed suit.

In 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration downgraded South Korea&#x27;s aviation safety rating and blocked South Korean carriers from expanding into the United States after the country and its carriers failed to improve sufficiently following a warning the previous year. The move was driven by the country&#x27;s lax oversight of its carriers including Korean Air.

The rating has since been restored as the airline invested billions of dollars to improve safety, upgrade its fleet, install new technology, and overhaul its corporate culture including hiring consultants from Boeing and Delta Air Lines. In 2002, the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that Korean Air had been removed from many &quot;shun lists&quot;.


=== Early 21st century ===
On 23 June 2000, along with Aeroméxico, Air France, and Delta Air Lines, Korean Air founded major airline alliance, SkyTeam and SkyTeam Cargo, founded on 28 September 2000.

On 5 June 2007, Korean Air said that it would create a new low-cost carrier called Jin Air in Korea to compete with Korea&#x27;s KTX high-speed railway network system, which offered cheaper fares and less stringent security procedures compared to air travel. Jin Air started scheduled passenger service on July 17, 2008. Korean Air announced that some of its 737s and A300s would be given to Jin Air.

In mid-2010, a co-marketing deal with games company Blizzard Entertainment sent a 747-400 and a 737-900 taking to the skies wrapped in StarCraft II branding. In August 2010, Korean Air announced heavy second-quarter losses despite record-high revenue.
In August 2010, Hanjin Group, the parent of KAL, opened a new cargo terminal at Navoiy International Airport in Uzbekistan, which will become a cargo hub with regular Seoul-Navoi-Milan flights.

In 2013, Korean Air acquired a 44% stake in Czech Airlines. It sold the stake in October 2017. On 1 May 2018, the airline launched a joint venture partnership with Delta Air Lines.

In 2019, Korean Air began playing a safety video with the K-pop group SuperM. It featured the song &quot;Let&#x27;s go everywhere&quot;, which was to be released as a single. The airline also featured the group on a livery sported by a Boeing 777-300ER, with registration HL8010.

In 2023, Korean Air was certified a 5-star Airline by Skytrax, an air transport rating organization.

=== Nut rage incident ===
Cho Hyun-Ah, also known as &quot;Heather Cho&quot;, is the daughter of then-chairman Cho Yang-ho. She resigned from some of her duties in late 2014 after she ordered a Korean Air jet to return to the gate to allow a flight attendant to be removed from the aircraft. The attendant had served Cho nuts in a bag instead of on a plate. As a result of further fallout, Cho Hyun-Ah was later arrested by Korean authorities for violating South Korea&#x27;s aviation safety laws.

=== Merger with Asiana Airlines ===
In November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the South Korean Government officially announced that Korean Air will acquire Asiana Airlines. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Republic of Korea will integrate subsidiaries Air Busan, Air Seoul, and Jin Air to form a combined low-cost carrier which will focus on regional airports in Korea.

In March 2021, KAL announced the merger with Asiana Airlines will be delayed as foreign authorities have not approved the deal. As of 2023, the deal has not been completed as essential countries have approached the deal with skepticism.

On 12 December 2024, Reuters reported that Korean Air had announced the completion of the purchase of debt-laden Asiana Airlines in a deal worth 1.5 trillion won (USD 1.6 billion). The deal enables Korean Air to acquire 63.88% of the second-largest airline in the country, becoming the 12th largest airline in the world by international capacity.

== Corporate affairs and identity ==
=== Ownership ===
Korean Air is owned by Hanjin Group and it is majority controlled by Hanjin KAL Corporation. The owner family of Hanjin Group is still the airline&#x27;s largest and controlling, shareholder; Walter Cho, its current chairman and CEO, is the third generation of the family to lead the airline. As of 5 June 2020, Hanjin KAL holds 29.27% of Korean Air shares.

=== Hubs and headquarters ===
Incheon International Airport Terminal 2 is Korean Air&#x27;s international hub.

Korean Air&#x27;s headquarters (대한항공 빌딩/大韓航空 빌딩) is located in Gonghang-dong, Gangseo District, Seoul.&lt;ref name=&quot;일반현황 / 기업개요&quot;&gt; &quot;주소: 서울 특별시 강서구 공항동 1370번지 대현항공 빌딩&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The company also maintains a satellite headquarters campus at Incheon. Korean Air also has offices at Gimpo International Airport in Seoul.

Korean Air&#x27;s other hubs are at Jeju International Airport, Jeju and Gimhae International Airport, Busan. The maintenance facilities are located in Gimhae International Airport. The majority of Korean Air&#x27;s pilots, ground staff, and flight attendants are based in Seoul and Busan.

=== Chaebol and nepotism ===
Korean Air has been cited as one of the examples of the South Korean &quot;chaebol&quot; system, wherein corporate conglomerates, established with government support, overreach diverse branches of industry. For much of the time between the foundation of Korean Air as Korean National Airlines in 1946 and the foundation of Asiana Airlines in 1988, Korean Air was the only airline operating in South Korea.

The process of the sale of Korean National Airlines to Hanjin in 1969 was supported by Park Chung Hee, the South Korean military general president who seized power of the country through a military coup d&#x27;état; and the monopoly of the airline was secured for two decades.

After widening the chaebol branches, the subsidiary corporations of Korean Air include marine and overland transportation businesses, hotels, and real estate among others; and the previous branches included heavy industry, passenger transportation, construction, and a stockbroking business. The nature of the South Korean chaebol system involves nepotism. A series of incidents involving Korean Air in the 2000s have &quot;revealed an ugly side of the culture within chaebols, South Korea&#x27;s giant family-run conglomerates&quot;.

=== Hotel ownership ===
Korean Air owns four hotels: two KAL hotels on Jeju Island, the Hyatt in Incheon, and a hotel/office building called the Wilshire Grand Tower in Los Angeles. This building in downtown Los Angeles houses the largest InterContinental Hotel in the Americas in what is the tallest building in Los Angeles.

=== Korean Air Aerospace Division ===
Korean Air is also involved in aerospace research and manufacturing. The division, known as the Korean Air Aerospace Division (KAL-ASD), has manufactured licensed versions of the MD Helicopters MD 500 and Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, as well as the Northrop F-5E/F Tiger II fighter aircraft, the aft fuselage and wings for the KF-16 fighter aircraft manufactured by Korean Aerospace Industries and parts for various commercial aircraft including the Boeing 737, Boeing 747, Boeing 777, and Boeing 787 Dreamliner; and the Airbus A330 and Airbus A380. In 1991, the division designed and flew the Korean Air Chang-Gong 91 light aircraft. KAA also provides aircraft maintenance support for the United States Department of Defense in Asia and maintains a research division with focuses on launch vehicles, satellites, commercial aircraft, military aircraft, helicopters, and simulation systems.

In October 2012, a development deal between Bombardier Aerospace and a government-led South Korean consortium was announced, aiming to develop a 90-seat turboprop regional airliner, targeting a 2019 launch date. The consortium would have included Korea Aerospace Industries and Korean Air. While this plan did not come to fruition, in 2019, Korean Aerospace Industries nevertheless decided to conduct a two-year study to assess the feasibility of taking the lead on building a turboprop airliner.

=== Fleet development ===
At the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines Assembly in 2018, Korean Air announced that it was considering a new large wide-body aircraft order to replace older Airbus A330, Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777-200ER, and Boeing 777-300. Types under consideration for replacement of older widebody aircraft in the fleet include the Boeing 777X and Airbus A350 XWB. At the International Air Transport Association Annual General Meeting (IATA AGM) in Seoul, Chairman Walter Cho said Korean Air&#x27;s widebody order is imminent and it is considering an extra order of Airbus A220 aircraft including the developing version Airbus A220-500.

In 2022, Korean Air was considering ordering a new freighter to continue the support cargo demand worldwide. Chairman of Korean Air Walter Cho said KAL is considering two options.

==Cabins==

Korean Air currently offers three types of first class, four types of business (&quot;Prestige&quot;) class, and standard economy class. Korean Air operates First Class on all of its Airbus A380-800s, Boeing 747-8Is and 777-200ERs, and part of its Boeing 777-300ER fleet. Some seats are equipped as suites with doors. The airline markets Business Class as &quot;Prestige Class&quot;, with some aircraft equipped with suites. The airline announced its introduction of Premium Economy in 2017. The first aircraft equipped with premium economy marketed as &quot;Economy Plus&quot; was CS300 (Airbus A220-300). The product was eliminated in 2019 due to discordance of service and profit loss. The airline also offers Economy Class.

== Incidents and accidents ==
In the late 1990s, Korean Air was &quot;an industry pariah, notorious for fatal crashes&quot; due to its extremely poor safety record and being one of the world&#x27;s most dangerous airlines. Safety has seemingly improved since as the airline made concerted efforts to improve standards in the early 21st century. In 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration upgraded Korea&#x27;s air-safety rating while Korean Air passed an International Air Transport Association audit in 2005.

Between 1970 and 1999, many fatal incidents occurred. Since 1970, 17 Korean Air aircraft have been written off in serious incidents and accidents with the loss of 700 lives. Two Korean Air aircraft were shot down by the Soviet Union, one operating as Korean Air Lines Flight 902 and the other as Korean Air Lines Flight 007.

Korean Air&#x27;s deadliest incident was Flight 007 which was shot down by the Soviet Union on September 1, 1983. All 269 people on board were killed, including a sitting U.S. Congressman, Larry McDonald.

The last fatal passenger accident was the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in 1997, which killed 229 people of the 254 people aboard including Shin Ki-ha, a South Korean parliamentarian. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that poor communication between the flight crew as the probable cause for the air crash, along with the captain&#x27;s poor decision-making on the non-precision approach.

The last crew fatalities were in the crash of Korean Air Cargo Flight 8509 in 1999 due to instrument malfunction and pilot error.

The last aircraft write-off occurred in 2022, when Korean Air Flight 631 overran the runway at Cebu, Philippines while attempting to land under poor weather conditions.

In a 2023 &quot;landmark decision&quot;, the state-affiliated Korea Worker&#x27;s Compensation and Welfare Service ruled that the cancer death of a flight attendant was akin to an industrial accident. The plaintiff had flown for 25 years on routes to Europe and America, which exposed workers to more cosmic radiation because Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is weaker over the North Pole. Korean Air said it monitors and limits individual radiation exposure to less than 6mSv a year. The plaintiff&#x27;s attorney contends that the company uses an old measuring method. The ruling panel said that the method employed by Korean Air could have downplayed the extent of radiation exposure and that the flight attendant could have been exposed to over 100mSv of radiation.

<text>The Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT- Roorkee or IIT-R) is a technical university located in Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India. It is the oldest engineering institution in India. It was founded as the College of Civil Engineering in 1847 during East India Company rule in India by James Thomason, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces in which Roorkee was located; its purpose was to train officers and surveyors employed in the construction of the Ganges Canal. In 1854, after the completion of the canal and Thomason&#x27;s death, it was renamed the Thomason College of Civil Engineering by Proby Cautley, the designer and projector of the canal. It was renamed University of Roorkee in 1949, and again renamed IIT Roorkee in 2001. The institution has 22 academic departments covering Engineering, Applied Sciences, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and Management programs with an emphasis on scientific and technological education and research.

==History==

The institution was founded in 1847 by James Thomason, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces (in which Roorkee then lay) to aid engineers and surveyors at work in the construction of the Ganges Canal. It offered instruction catered to a variety of students; this included an engineering class for the domiciled British and some Indians; an upper subordinates class for British noncommissioned officers; and a lower subordinates class for Indian surveyors. By the mid-1880s, &quot;the school has a hundred students, substantial buildings, and a reputation as an important center for the study of hydraulic engineering.&quot;

An Electrical Engineering department was added in 1897. The architecture department instituted a master&#x27;s degree course in Architecture (M. Arch.) in 196970.

In 1978, the Institute of Paper Technology, Saharanpur was merged with the then University of Roorkee. The Institute of Paper Technology was established as School of Paper Technology by the Government of India in 1964, with an aid from the Royal Swedish Government. The school was renamed as the Institute of Paper Technology in July 1968 and subsequently Department of Paper Technology in July 1992.

The first edition of Thomso, the institute&#x27;s annual cultural festival was held in 1982. In 1997 the government of India released a stamp dedicated to 150th anniversary of university of Roorkee.

On 21 September 2001, an ordinance issued by the Government of India declared it as the nation&#x27;s seventh Indian Institute of Technology, renaming it to the current name, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. The ordinance was converted into an act by the Parliament to make IIT Roorkee an &quot;Institution of National Importance&quot;.

<doc id="315414" wikidata="Q2226682" url="?curid=315414" title="Gelfand–Naimark theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Gelfand–Naimark theorem states that an arbitrary C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is isometrically *-isomorphic to a C*-subalgebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space. This result was proven by Israel Gelfand and Mark Naimark in 1943 and was a significant point in the development of the theory of C*-algebras since it established the possibility of considering a C*-algebra as an abstract algebraic entity without reference to particular realizations as an operator algebra.

==Details==
The Gelfand–Naimark representation π is the Hilbert space analogue of the direct sum of representations π&quot;f&quot; of &quot;A&quot; where &quot;f&quot; ranges over the set of pure states of A and π&quot;f&quot; is the irreducible representation associated to &quot;f&quot; by the GNS construction. Thus the Gelfand–Naimark representation acts on the Hilbert direct sum of the Hilbert spaces &quot;H&quot;&quot;f&quot; by

:formula_1

π(&quot;x&quot;) is a bounded linear operator since it is the direct sum of a family of operators, each one having norm ≤ ||&quot;x&quot;||.

Theorem. The Gelfand–Naimark representation of a C*-algebra is an isometric *-representation.

It suffices to show the map π is injective, since for *-morphisms of C*-algebras injective implies isometric. Let &quot;x&quot; be a non-zero element of &quot;A&quot;. By the Krein extension theorem for positive linear functionals, there is a state &quot;f&quot; on &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) ≥ 0 for all non-negative z in &quot;A&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(−&quot;x&quot;* &quot;x&quot;) &lt; 0. Consider the GNS representation π&quot;f&quot; with cyclic vector ξ. Since

:formula_2

it follows that π&quot;f&quot; (x) ≠ 0, so π (x) ≠ 0, so π is injective.

The construction of Gelfand–Naimark &quot;representation&quot; depends only on the GNS construction and therefore it is meaningful for any Banach *-algebra &quot;A&quot; having an approximate identity. In general (when &quot;A&quot; is not a C*-algebra) it will not be a faithful representation. The closure of the image of π(&quot;A&quot;) will be a C*-algebra of operators called the C*-enveloping algebra of &quot;A&quot;. Equivalently, we can define the 
C*-enveloping algebra as follows: Define a real valued function on &quot;A&quot; by
:formula_3
as &quot;f&quot; ranges over pure states of &quot;A&quot;. This is a semi-norm, which we refer to as the &quot;C* semi-norm&quot; of &quot;A&quot;. The set I of elements of &quot;A&quot; whose semi-norm is 0 forms a two sided-ideal in &quot;A&quot; closed under involution. Thus the quotient vector space &quot;A&quot; / I is an involutive algebra and the norm

:formula_4

factors through a norm on &quot;A&quot; / I, which except for completeness, is a C* norm on &quot;A&quot; / I (these are sometimes called pre-C*-norms). Taking the completion of &quot;A&quot; / I relative to this pre-C*-norm produces a C*-algebra &quot;B&quot;.

By the Krein–Milman theorem one can show without too much difficulty that for &quot;x&quot; an element of the Banach *-algebra &quot;A&quot; having an approximate identity:
:formula_5
It follows that an equivalent form for the C* norm on &quot;A&quot; is to take the above supremum over all states.

The universal construction is also used to define universal C*-algebras of isometries.

Remark. The Gelfand representation or Gelfand isomorphism for a commutative C*-algebra with unit formula_6 is an isometric *-isomorphism from formula_6 to the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on the space of multiplicative linear functionals, which in the commutative case are precisely the pure states, of &quot;A&quot; with the weak* topology.

<doc id="315416" wikidata="Q6313" url="?curid=315416" title="Meissen (district)">
<text>Meissen () is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the state of Brandenburg, the district of Bautzen, the urban district Dresden, the districts Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge, Mittelsachsen and Nordsachsen.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Amt Meißen&quot;, which was first mentioned in 1334. The district was ruled by the Wettin dynasty.
The Margraves of what then became the Margravate of Meissen created the administrative division (&quot;Amt&quot;) in the 13th century. In 1835 the &quot;Amt&quot; was converted into an &quot;Amtshauptmannschaft&quot;, with the area of the current district covered by the &quot;Amtshauptmannschaften&quot; Meissen, Dresden and Großenhain. In 1939, these were renamed &quot;Landkreise&quot; (districts). In the administrative reform of 1952, several municipalities were transferred to the districts of Freiberg and Döbeln. In 1990, the old district borders were restored, and in 1996 parts of the district Dresden-Land were added. In August 2008 the district of Riesa-Großenhain was added to the district to give it its current size.

==Geography==
The main river of the district is the Elbe, which also flows through the town of Meissen.

<text>Amerika, (German working title &quot;Der Verschollene&quot;, &quot;The Missing&quot;) also known as Amerika (The Man Who Disappeared), Amerika: The Missing Person and Lost in America, is the incomplete first novel by author Franz Kafka (1883–1924), written between 1911 and 1914 and published posthumously in 1927. The novel originally began as a short story titled &quot;The Stoker&quot;. The novel incorporates many details of the experiences of his relatives who had emigrated to the United States. The commonly used title &quot;Amerika&quot; is from the edition of the text put together by Kafka&#x27;s close friend, Max Brod, after Kafka&#x27;s death in 1924. It has been published in several English-language versions, including as &quot;Amerika&quot;, translated by Edwin and Willa Muir (1938); as &quot;Amerika (The Man Who Disappeared)&quot;, translated by Michael Hofmann (1996); as &quot;Amerika: The Missing Person&quot;, translated by Mark Harman (2008), as &quot;Lost in America&quot;, translated by Anthony Northey (2010), and as &quot;The Man Who Disappeared (America)&quot;, translated by Ritchie Robertson (2012).

==Plot summary==

:&quot;The first chapter of this novel is a short story titled &quot;The Stoker&quot;.&quot;

The story describes the bizarre wanderings of sixteen-year-old European immigrant Karl Roßmann (Rossmann), who was forced to go to New York City to escape the scandal of getting a housemaid pregnant. As the ship arrives in the United States, he becomes friends with a stoker who is about to be dismissed from his job. Karl identifies with the stoker and decides to help him; together they go to see the captain of the ship. In a surreal turn of events, Karl&#x27;s uncle, Senator Jacob, is in a meeting with the captain. Karl does not know that Senator Jacob is his uncle, but Mr. Jacob recognizes him and takes him away from the stoker.

Karl stays with his uncle for some time but is later abandoned by him after making a visit to his uncle&#x27;s friend without his uncle&#x27;s full approval. Wandering aimlessly, he becomes friends with two drifters named Robinson and Delamarche. They promise to find him a job, but they sell his suit without permission, eat his food in front of him without offering him any, and ransack his belongings. Finally, Karl departs from them on bad terms after he&#x27;s offered a job by a manager at Hotel Occidental. He works there as a lift-boy. One day Robinson shows up drunk at his work asking him for money. Afraid of losing his job if seen talking with a friend, which is forbidden for lift-boys, Karl agrees to lend him money, then commits the far worse offence of bunking a drunk-sick Robinson in the lift-boy dorm.

Being dismissed for leaving his post, Karl agrees not only to pay for Robinson&#x27;s taxi, but also joins him. They travel to Delamarche&#x27;s place. Delamarche is now staying with a wealthy and obese lady named Brunelda. She wants to take in Karl as her servant. Karl refuses, but Delamarche physically forces him to stay and he is imprisoned in her apartment. He tries to break out, but is beaten by Delamarche and Robinson. On the balcony, he chats with a student who tells him he should stay, because it is hard to find a job elsewhere. He decides to stay.

One day he sees an advertisement for the Nature Theatre of Oklahoma, which is looking for employees. The theatre promises to find employment for everyone. Karl applies for a job and gets engaged as a &quot;technical worker.&quot; He is then sent to Oklahoma by train and is welcomed by the vastness of the valleys and adopts the name &quot;Negro&quot; as his own.

==Uncertainties==

===Title===
In conversations Kafka used to refer to this book as his &quot;American novel&quot;, later he called it simply &quot;The Stoker&quot;, after the title of the first chapter, which appeared separately in 1913. Kafka&#x27;s working title was &quot;The Man Who Disappeared&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The title &quot;Amerika&quot; was chosen by Kafka&#x27;s literary executor, Max Brod, who assembled the uncompleted manuscript and published it after his death. Brod donated the manuscript to the University of Oxford.

===Ending===
Kafka broke off his work on this novel with unexpected suddenness, and it remained unfinished. From what he told his friend and biographer Max Brod, the incomplete chapter &quot;The Nature Theatre of Oklahoma&quot; (a chapter the beginning of which particularly delighted Kafka, so that he used to read it aloud with great effect) was intended to be the concluding chapter of the work and was supposed to end on a note of reconciliation. In enigmatic language, Kafka used to hint smilingly that within this &quot;almost limitless&quot; theatre his young hero was going to find again a profession, a stand-by, his freedom, even his old home and his parents, as if by some celestial witchery.

The parts of the narrative immediately preceding this chapter are also incomplete. Two large fragments, describing Karl&#x27;s service with Brunelda, are extant, but do not fill up the gaps. Only the first six chapters were divided and given titles by Kafka.

==Major themes==
The novel is more explicitly humorous but slightly more realistic (except in the last chapter) than most of Kafka&#x27;s works, but it shares the same motifs of an oppressive and intangible system putting the protagonist repeatedly in bizarre situations. Specifically, within &quot;Amerika&quot;, a scorned individual often must plead his innocence in front of remote and mysterious figures of authority. However, it is often Karl who voluntarily submits to such treatment (helping a drunk Robinson at the hotel rather than having him thrown out, paying for Robinson&#x27;s taxi, travelling to Delamarche&#x27;s home, resigning himself to stay in imprisonment).

In the story, the Statue of Liberty is holding a sword, and some scholars have interpreted this as a &quot;might makes right&quot; philosophy Kafka may have believed the United States holds.

==Inspiration==
Kafka was fond of reading travel books and memoirs. &quot;The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin&quot; was one of his favorite books, from which he liked reading passages aloud. Although he always had a longing for free space and distant lands, it is said that he never travelled farther than France and Upper Italy. Despite this, a rare photo shows Kafka with an unidentified man at Marielyst beach in Denmark.

Kafka, at the time, was also reading, or rereading, several novels by Charles Dickens and wrote in his diary: &quot;My intention was, as I now see, to write a Dickens novel, enriched by the sharper lights which I took from our modern times, and by the pallid ones I would have found in my own interior.&quot;

German artist Martin Kippenberger attempted to complete the story in his installation &quot;The Happy Ending of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Amerika&quot;&quot;.

In 2016, American rock band Young the Giant released the single &quot;Amerika&quot; as part of an inspiration from Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Amerika&quot;.

<text>Biggleswade ( ) is a market town and civil parish in Central Bedfordshire in Bedfordshire, England. It lies on the River Ivel, 11 miles (18 km) south-east of Bedford. Its population was 16,551 in the 2011 United Kingdom census, This figure increased by 36% to 22,541 at the time of the 2021 United Kingdom census.

Evidence of settlement in the area goes back to the Neolithic period, but it is likely that the town as such was founded by Anglo-Saxons. A gold Anglo-Saxon coin was found on a footpath beside the River Ivel in 2001. The British Museum bought the coin in February 2006 and at the time, it was the most expensive British coin purchased. A charter to hold a market was granted by King John in the 13th-century. In 1785 a great fire devastated the town. The Great North Road passed through until a bypass was completed in 1961. A railway station was opened in 1850. From the 1930s to the late 1990s, manufacturing provided a significant amount of employment. The town centre is designated a conservation area.

==Geography==
Biggleswade lies about 40 miles (60 km) north of Central London and 20 miles (30 km) west-south-west of Cambridge. 
Biggleswade civil parish includes the nearby hamlet of Holme.
From Biggleswade station on the East Coast Main Line trains take about 45 minutes to reach London. The A1, Britain&#x27;s Great North Road, bypasses the town; its old course is numbered A6001. The B1040 road leads north to Potton and St. Ives and the B659 south to Langford and Henlow.

Elevation

The town centre is about 28 m (92 ft) above sea level. The land rises to 78 m (256 ft) at the parish&#x27;s southern boundary near the water tower on Topler&#x27;s Hill.

Soil and geology

The area&#x27;s soil is mostly freely draining and slightly acid, but with a base-rich, loamy texture of sand, silt and clay particles. Fertility is high.

The underlying geology of the Ivel Valley is alluvial. The town centre stands largely on river gravel, with smaller areas of green and brown sands and sandstones, and glacial gravel. Boulder clay dominates the outlying southern and eastern parts.

Landscape

&quot;Biggleswade Common&quot; is an area of grassland that extends northwards along the eastern bank of the River Ivel from the Shortmead Street bridge. It continues clockwise, crossing Potton Road at the town&#x27;s eastern boundary to a section known locally as &quot;the Pastures&quot;. Its 300 acres (120 ha) make it the largest area of common land in Bedfordshire. It has loamy and sandy soils with naturally high groundwater and a peaty surface. It is run by an association of rights owners called the Fen Reeves of Biggleswade Common, as a working common grazed by horses and cattle.

There is a wind farm of ten turbines to the south of the town. A solar power farm is located to the north of Shortmead House.

River Ivel

The Environment Agency has a monitoring station at Biggleswade. The normal level of the River Ivel at Biggleswade is between and . The highest level recorded was reached on Wednesday 11 February 2009.

==Governance==

Biggleswade was a constituent part of and gave its name to one of the Hundreds of Bedfordshire from Anglo-Saxon times until the 19th century. From 1892 the town was governed by a Local Board, which became Biggleswade Urban District under the Local Government Act 1894. This council met at Biggleswade Town Hall until 1926, then shared other premises in the town before acquiring Stratton House in 1952. The Urban District Council was abolished in 1974 when most of its functions were subsumed into Mid Bedfordshire District Council under the Local Government Act 1972, the remainder passing to the newly formed Biggleswade Town Council. In 2009, the District and County Councils were replaced by the Central Bedfordshire Unitary Authority.

Biggleswade Town Council&#x27;s responsibilities include car parks, allotment gardens, cemeteries (Drove Road and Stratton Way), play and recreation areas and the Orchard Community Centre. Planning applications referred from Central Bedfordshire Council are considered and objections can be raised.

Biggleswade divides into three electoral wards: Ivel for the north, Holme for the south-west, and Stratton for the south-east. Voters elect five councillors per ward, for four-year terms. They in turn elect annually a Town Mayor.

Town Council funds come from a precept agreed with Central Bedfordshire Council. Council meetings since 2006 have been held in a council chamber in the former magistrates&#x27; court in Saffron Road.

Central Bedfordshire Council is responsible for Biggleswade&#x27;s social care homes, public library (Chestnut Avenue), roads, refuse, Saxon Pool and Leisure Centre (managed on its behalf by SLL), non-academy schools, social services and planning. Five shire councillors are elected to serve a four-year term for the Biggleswade East (two members) and Biggleswade West (three members) wards.

Biggleswade was a UK parliamentary constituency from 1885 to 1918. The town was then in Mid Bedfordshire until 1997. Now in North Bedfordshire, the elected member is Richard Fuller of the Conservative Party.

==History==
The area around Biggleswade is thought to have been inhabited from about 10,000 BC. Arrowheads believed to be from this time have been found. Sherds of late Neolithic pottery from a single Peterborough ware Mortlake bowl were found in a pit excavated south of Biggleswade Hospital. A Neolithic cursus and five associated ring ditches south of Furzenhall Farm show as crop markings on aerial images.

Archaeological excavations in 2001 discovered a late Bronze Age pit to the north of the water tower on Topler&#x27;s Hill. Iron Age pottery and a bead together with charred cereal grains of wheat and barley have been found in pits to the north of the town.

In Roman times, a loop road known as the White Way passed through Biggleswade (possibly along the course of the present-day Drove Road), linking with Ermine Way at Godmanchester. There is evidence for a probable Romano-Celtic temple and aligned enclosures straddling a tributary of the River Ivel at the north-east corner of Biggleswade Common.

===Anglo-Saxons===
In the 5th century AD, Saxon invaders settled. The name Biggleswade may derive from Biceil, an Anglo-Saxon personal name, and Waed, the Saxon word for ford. Variant spellings include &quot;Bykeleswad&quot; in 1396, &quot;Bykleswade&quot; in 15th-century law records, and &quot;Bickleswade&quot; on a 17th-century ivory seal now in the British Museum.

Wells and pits dating from the early 7th century and a quantity of later Maxey ware have been excavated at Stratton.

Evidence of an Anglo-Saxon ringwork and bailey castle was discovered by aerial photography in 1954 between the A1 road and the River Ivel.
In 2001 a gold coin bearing the name Coenwulf was found at Biggleswade on a footpath beside the River Ivel. The 4.33 g (0.15 oz) mancus, worth about 30 silver pennies, is only the eighth known gold coin dating to the mid to late Anglo-Saxon period. Its inscription, &quot;DE VICO LVNDONIAE&quot;, shows it was minted in London. Initially sold to American collector Allan Davisson for £230,000 at auction; the British Government subsequently put in place a temporary export ban in the hope of saving it for the nation. The British Museum bought the coin in February 2006 for £357,832, with the help of funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the British Museum Friends. At the time, it was the most expensive British coin purchased.

===Medieval times===
Biggleswade parish consisted of three settlements: Biggleswade, Holme and Stratton.

Biggleswade is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Bichelesuuade/Pichelsuuade: Ralph de l&#x27;Isle. 2 mills&quot;. Domesday records 27 heads of household in Stratton vill, but only 20 in Biggleswade. However, Biggleswade had overtaken Stratton by 1309.

In 1132, Henry I granted the manor of Biggleswade to Bishop Alexander the Magnificent of Lincoln, to help endow Lincoln Cathedral. A prebendal stall of Biggleswade is in the cathedral. King John (1196–1216) granted a charter to hold a market. The medieval parish Church of St Andrew contains a monumental brass of John Rudying featuring a figure of Death.

Stratton Park Moated Enclosure lies to the south of the town off Dunton Lane.

===The Great Fire===
On 16 June 1785 a fire started at the &quot;Crown Inn&quot; and spread rapidly through neighbouring streets, destroying nearly one-third of the town. A national appeal raised funds for 332 people who lost their homes and others who lost their livelihoods.

The Great Fire is among the historical scenes shown in a Millennium stained-glass window in St Andrew&#x27;s Church.

===Transport===
A medieval bridge carrying the Great North Road over the River Ivel at Biggleswade is first documented in the early 13th century. In 1302 Bishop Dalderby of Lincoln gave indulgences to all those contributing to the repair of the bridge, and from 1372 tolls were authorised under the pontage system. The Great North Road became a turnpike road in 1725 (from Biggleswade to Alconbury Hill) and in 1730 (from Stevenage to Biggleswade). In 1796 the medieval bridge in Shortmead Street was rebuilt with sandstone from Sandy. It had three rounded arches. A metal &quot;Meccano&quot;-type bridge was erected alongside in 1939. In 1948 the stone bridge was demolished and replaced with a second &quot;Meccano&quot; or Callender-Hamilton bridge as it was formally known. The town was bypassed by the A1 trunk road in 1961. The current bridge dates from 1999.

The River Ivel was made navigable to Biggleswade Mill in 1758 from its confluence with the River Ouse at Tempsford; and extended to Shefford in 1823. Timber and coal were transported. In 1876 the canal was abandoned by Act of Parliament.

Through the 19th century Biggleswade was a staging post for coaches. Destinations included London, Leeds, York and Boston, Lincolnshire.

The Great Northern Railway opened a station in 1850.

Eastern National operated local bus services until 1952, followed by United Counties. A bus depot in Shortmead Street until 1989 was replaced by Millers Court retirement apartments. Stagecoach took over in November 1987 and relocated its depot in Hitchin Street. Private bus operators based in Biggleswade included Charles Cook Travel (1947–1997) and Fairway Coaches (1973–1997).

===Workhouses===

From about 1780, Brigham House, 93 High Street, (now George Hay, Chartered Accountants) housed the parish workhouse. The premises were closed following the completion of The Union Workhouse at London Road in 1836. The Biggleswade Poor Law Union was officially formed on 14 April 1835 and covered 25 parishes. The Union workhouse ceased operation in 1930. The London Road building was renamed The Limes and provided accommodation for the aged, infirm and vagrants. It was used as an old people&#x27;s home until its closure in 1969 and demolished in 1972.

===Agriculture and industry===
In 1868, &quot;The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27;s&quot; entry for Biggleswade describes the surrounding district as &quot;fertile, and the inhabitants... chiefly engaged in agricultural pursuits, and in market gardening&quot; while &quot;many of the female inhabitants are employed in lace-making and the manufacture of straw-plait.&quot; Though much of the vegetable trade has ended, Bedfordshire Growers on Potton Road still supplies supermarkets with UK-grown potatoes and onions.

Samuel Wells established a brewery in 1764. Wells and Winch built a new brewery in 1901 in Church Street. Greene King owned it from 1961 until October 1997. The site is now taken by an Asda supermarket.

The Morton and Kinman owned Vulcan Foundry off Foundry Lane and Saffron Road made the iron work for the Ivel Navigation bridges at Blunham, Mill Lane and Holme in 1823.

From 1862, coachbuilder Maythorn had a factory on Market Square/Station Road. New premises were built in 1925. After the firm&#x27;s demise in 1931, the factory and offices were utilised by NURO to make photographic film from 1935 to 1938; the NAAFI as a warehouse from 1940 to 1958 and Delaney Gallay and Gloster Saro, to make heat-insulation materials for aircraft, including Concorde. The building was demolished in 1987 to make way for shops and a car park.

The Ivel Cycle Works in Shortmead Street, founded by Dan Albone in 1881, made bicycles, motorbikes and light tractors until 1922.
Holme Mills, listed in the Domesday Book has been the home of Jordans Cereals since 1893. The company also has a unit on Stratton Business Park. Franklin&#x27;s Mill in Mill Lane closed in 1945 following a fire. The mill building was restored and used as a warehouse before being converted into flats in 1982. Bedfordshire&#x27;s tallest windmill, at 70 ft (21m), stood in Hitchin Street from 1858 until 1967.

Books, diaries, binders and sketch pads were made by Adams &amp; Harrison which moved from Clerkenwell, London to Havelock Road in 1933. The factory closed in 1987 and gave way to housing in Reynolds Close. A major employer was Cincinnati Milacron, on a site between Dells Lane and the railway. The company, then named Weatherley Oilgear Ltd, came to Biggleswade in 1939; it made broaching machines. The factory was demolished in the mid-1980s and the site is now home to the &quot;Poets&quot; estate (Tennyson Avenue, Chaucer Drive, Dickens Court and Bunyan Drive). Off Hitchin Street, the roads &quot;Berkeley Close&quot; and &quot;Kayser Court&quot; are named after Berkeley, who made caravans and sports cars from 1947 to 1960 and Kayser Bondor, who made lingerie and nightdresses in the town from 1938 to 1991. Smart and Brown made precision lathes in London Road from 1946 until 1980. Felix established a Potton Road factory in 1949; it closed in the 1970s and its place is now taken by housing in Mountbatten Drive. Ribbon cables and printed circuit board connectors for computers were made in the converted Empire Cinema on Hitchin Street by Electro Methods from 1959; ownership changes saw the firm renamed Ether, then Pye Connectors and finally Flexicon, until closure in 1990.

===Cinema===
The Empire (originally The Cinema Palace) in Hitchin Street operated from 1913 to 1958. The building was converted into a factory making electrical connectors but was demolished in 1994 and the site is now occupied by housing in Empire Way. The 700-seat Regal Cinema in Station Road opened in 1936; after closure in 1976, it was converted into a bingo hall.

==Hotels, inns and public houses==
Biggleswade once had numerous inns and public houses due to its location on the Great North Road. Fifty two were trading in 1876. By July 2019, just nine remained, plus an additional new-build. 
&quot;The Crown Hotel&quot;, rebuilt in 1793 after the Great Fire of 1785, was reopened by J D Wetherspoon in August 2017 after standing empty for four years. The 17th-century, Grade II listed &quot;White Hart&quot; is thought to be the town&#x27;s second oldest building after St Andrew&#x27;s Church. &quot;The King&#x27;s Reach&quot; was opened in December 2018 by the McMullen Brewery of Hertford.

==Culture and community==
===Town carnival===
The carnival has been held each June since 1957. It was launched to raise funds to build a public swimming pool. An outdoor heated pool in Playfield Close was opened in May 1968. Further funds raised through sponsors and donations have since been distributed to local community groups, sports clubs, schools, public services and charities.

A competition is held early each year to select a Carnival Court comprising a Queen, Princess and Prince. The main event is a Saturday afternoon parade of themed floats through the town. Carnival week features a funfair in the Market Square.

<doc id="315423" wikidata="Q5419198" url="?curid=315423" title="Ex parte McCardle">
<text>Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506 (1869), was a United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court held that Congress has the authority to withdraw the Supreme Court&#x27;s appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of lower courts at any time. The entirety of the Court&#x27;s appellate jurisdiction is determined by federal law.

==Case history==
During the Civil War Reconstruction, newspaper publisher William McCardle printed some &quot;incendiary&quot; articles, advocating opposition to the Reconstruction laws enacted by Congress. He was jailed by a military commander under the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867. McCardle invoked &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the Circuit Court of the Southern District of Mississippi. The judge sent him back into custody, finding the military actions legal under Congress&#x27; law. He appealed to the Supreme Court under the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, which granted appellate jurisdiction to review denial of habeas corpus petitions. After the case was argued but before an opinion was delivered, Congress suspended the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisdiction over the case, exercising the powers granted under Article III, section 2 of the Constitution.

==Issues==
Two issues were raised by this case: Whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the case, and if so, whether McCardle&#x27;s imprisonment violated his Fifth Amendment Due Process rights.

==Holdings==

Chief Justice Chase, writing for a unanimous court, validated congressional withdrawal of the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction. The basis for this repeal was the exceptions clause of Article III, section 2. But Chase pointedly reminded his readers that the 1868 statute repealing jurisdiction &quot;does not affect the jurisdiction which was previously exercised.&quot; Since the Court held it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case, the second question was not answered. Since Congress had withdrawn jurisdiction to hear the case, McCardle had no legal recourse to challenge his imprisonment in federal court.

==Rationale==
&quot;Durousseau v. United States&quot;, 10 U.S. 307 (1810) held that Congress&#x27;s affirmative description of certain judicial powers implied a negation of all other powers. Creating such legislation was legitimate under the authority granted them by the United States Constitution. By repealing the act that granted the Supreme Court authority to hear the case, Congress made a clear statement that they were using this Constitutional authority to remove the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisdiction. The court had no choice but to dismiss the case.

<text>Arnold Gerschwiler OBE (28 May 1914 – 22 August 2003) was a Swiss (later, British) figure skating coach.

== Personal life ==
Gerschwiler was born in Arbon, Switzerland. He was the half-brother of Jacques Gerschwiler and the uncle of Hans Gerschwiler. At the encouragement of Jacques, he moved to London, England. He married Violet Blundell in August 1941. They had two daughters, Stella and Claire, two grandsons and two granddaughters.

Gerschwiler lived in Ailsa Road, St Margarets, Twickenham for 53 years. He died, aged 89, on 22 August 2003 at St Anthony&#x27;s Hospital, North Cheam.

== Career ==
Gerschwiler competed in the British Open Ice-Skating Championships in 1935 and 1936 and joined the staff of the Richmond Ice Rink in 1937. He was head coach there from 1938, and served as director in 1964 until the facility was demolished in 1992. He coached the Czech skater Alena Vrzanova (Aja Zanova), world champion in 1949 and 1950, as well as his own nephew Hans Gerschwiler, the 1948 Olympic silver medallist.

He also coached the British skaters John Curry, 1976 Olympic and world champion, and Valda Osborn, British champion in 1952 and 1953 and European champion in 1953. Other European top skaters he coached included Michael Booker, Ladislav Čáp, Sjoukje Dijkstra, Patricia Dodd, Hanna Eigel, Joan Haanappel, Helmut Seibt and Daphne Walker.

Gerschwiler was appointed to the Order of the British Empire in 1997. He and his brother Jacques were inducted into the Professional Skaters Association&#x27;s Coaches Hall of Fame in 2004.

<doc id="315426" wikidata="Q544697" url="?curid=315426" title="Mediocrity principle">
<text>The mediocrity principle is the philosophical notion that &quot;if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it&#x27;s more likely to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories&quot;. The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the evolution of the Solar System, Earth&#x27;s history, the evolution of biological complexity, human evolution, or any one nation. It is a heuristic in the vein of the Copernican principle, and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even superior.

David Bates ascribed the mediocrity principle to Sebastian von Hoerner, who as early as 1961 wrote the following:
==Extraterrestrial life==
The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that should life exist elsewhere in the universe, it will typically exist on Earth-like planets.

== Measurement of distance to stars ==
The mediocrity principle was implicitly applied during the 17th century, when astronomers attempted to measure the distance between distant stars and the Earth. By assuming that the Sun was just an average star, and that some stars seemed brighter simply because they were closer to us, they were able to estimate how far these stars were from the Earth. Although this method was flawed due to the differences among stars, it gave astronomers at that time a rough idea of how far the stars were from the Earth. For example, James Gregory, Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens were able to estimate the distance between Sirius and the Earth through this method.

==Comparison with other approaches==
The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the anthropic principle, which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be observed to exist, no matter how improbable. Both stand in contrast to the fine-tuning hypothesis, which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of any happening at all, whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one (self-described) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single data point statistics, also present in the German tank problem.

==Longevity estimation==

 \le T_{\text{now}} \le \left(\frac{1 - z}{z}\right) \cdot T_{\text{end}} \\
z = \frac{1 - \text{confidence interval}}{2}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
|caption=Longevity Estimation Equations

The mediocrity principle can also be used to estimate the future life expectancy of presently observable objects, and is especially useful when no hard data is available. Richard Gott extended the mediocrity principle to argue that if there is nothing special about observing an object in the present moment (Tnow), then one can expect the present moment to occur randomly between the start (Tstart) and the end (Tend) of the observed object&#x27;s longevity. Therefore, the total longevity of an observable object can be expected (with 50% confidence) to lie in the interval 1/3 ⋅ Tstart &lt; Tnow &lt; 3 ⋅ Tend. This estimation technique was derived after a 1969 visit to the Berlin Wall, which was constructed eight years earlier. Gott reasoned that there was nothing special about the timing of his visit, so the above equation (with T = 8) estimates that the Berlin Wall would be likely to last for at least 2.67 years but no longer than 24 years. (The Berlin Wall fell 20 years later, in 1989.) 

Longevity estimation reflects the maxim &quot;old things tend to last and new things tend to disappear.&quot; Most applications of longevity estimation use a 95% confidence interval, which decreases the precision of the estimate by drastically increasing the interval of estimation. One useful estimation made on this confidence interval is the survival of Homo sapiens, which is thought to have emerged around 200,000 years ago. If there is nothing special about our observation of species now, in the 21st century, then longevity estimation (with T = 200,000 and a confidence interval of 95%) yields a projected timespan of between 5,100 and 7.8 million years during which the human species will be extant. 

Some other projected lifespans (with 95% confidence) include industrial technology (estimated to last somewhere between 7 years and 10,000 years), the internet (between 7 months and 975 years), and Wikipedia (between 6 months and 772 years). Jim Holt analyzed longevity estimation and concluded that our understanding of humor and number will survive for at least one million years. Humans share these traits with other species, which implies we share these traits with some common ancestor that lived millions of years ago.

==Other uses==
David Deutsch argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference either to humanity&#x27;s part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to Stephen Hawking&#x27;s quote: &quot;The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies&quot;. Deutsch wrote that Earth&#x27;s neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe&#x27;s matter is dark matter) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an &quot;isolated, uncommon phenomenon&quot;. He also disagrees with Richard Dawkins, who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect neutrinos, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.

<doc id="315427" wikidata="Q153660" url="?curid=315427" title="Italian Social Republic">
<text>The Italian Social Republic (, ; RSI; , ), known prior to December 1943 as the National Republican State of Italy (; SNRI), but more popularly known as the Republic of Salò (, ), was a German puppet state and fascist rump state with limited diplomatic recognition that was created during the latter part of World War II. It existed from the beginning of the German occupation of Italy in September 1943 until the surrender of Axis troops in Italy in May 1945. The German occupation triggered widespread national resistance against it and the Italian Social Republic, leading to the Italian Civil War.

The Italian Social Republic was the second and last incarnation of the Italian Fascist state, led by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and his reformed anti-monarchist Republican Fascist Party. The newly founded state declared Rome its capital but the &quot;de facto&quot; capital was Salò (hence the colloquial name of the state), a small town on Lake Garda, near Brescia, where Mussolini and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were headquartered. The Italian Social Republic nominally exercised sovereignty in Northern and Central Italy, but was largely dependent on German troops to maintain control.

In July 1943, after the Allies had pushed Italy out of North Africa and subsequently invaded Sicily, the Grand Council of Fascism—with the support of King Victor Emmanuel III—overthrew and arrested Mussolini. The new government began secret peace negotiations with the Allied powers but when the Armistice of Cassibile was announced on 8 September, Nazi Germany was prepared and quickly intervened. German troops seized control of the northern half of Italy, freed Mussolini, and brought him to the German-occupied area to establish a satellite regime. The Italian Social Republic was proclaimed on 23 September 1943. Although the RSI claimed sovereignty over all of Italy and its colonies, its &quot;de facto&quot; jurisdiction only extended to a vastly reduced portion of the country. The RSI received diplomatic recognition only from the Axis powers and their satellite states. Finland and Vichy France, although in the German orbit, did not recognize it. Unofficial relations were maintained with Argentina, Portugal, Spain, and, through commercial agents, Switzerland. Vatican City did not recognize the RSI.

Around 25 April 1945, 19 months after its founding, the RSI all but collapsed. In Italy, the day is known as Liberation Day (&quot;festa della liberazione&quot;). On that day, a general partisan uprising, alongside the efforts of Allied forces during their final offensive in Italy, managed to oust the Germans and the remaining RSI forces from Italy almost entirely. Mussolini was captured and killed by Italian partisans on 28 April as he and an entourage attempted to flee. The RSI Minister of Defense, Rodolfo Graziani, surrendered what was left of the Italian Social Republic on 1 May, one day after the German forces in Italy capitulated.

== Context of its creation ==

On 24 July 1943, after the Allied landings in Sicily, on a motion by Dino Grandi, the Grand Council of Fascism voted a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Mussolini&#x27;s authority had been undermined by a series of military defeats from the start of Italy&#x27;s entry into the war during June 1940, including the bombing of Rome, the loss of the African colonies in the East African and North African campaigns, the defeat of the Italian Army in Russia and the Allied invasion of Sicily.

The next day, King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini from office, ordered him arrested, and appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio as new prime minister. By this time, the monarchy, a number of Fascist government members, and the general Italian population had grown tired of the futile war effort which had driven Italy into subordination to and subjugation by Nazi Germany. The failed war effort left Mussolini humiliated at home and abroad as a &quot;sawdust Caesar&quot;. The new government began secret negotiations with the Allied powers and made preparations for the capitulation of Italy. These surrender talks implied a commitment from Badoglio to leave the Axis alliance.

While the Germans formally recognised the new &quot;status quo&quot; in Italian politics, they intervened by sending some of the best units of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; to Italy. This was done both to resist new Allied advances and to face the predictably imminent defection of Italy. While Badoglio continued to swear loyalty to Germany and the Axis powers, Italian government emissaries prepared to sign an armistice at Cassibile in Allied-occupied Sicily, which was finalized on 3 September.

On 8 September, Badoglio announced Italy&#x27;s armistice with the Allies (although termed an &quot;armistice&quot;, its terms made it akin to an unconditional surrender). German &quot;Führer&quot; Adolf Hitler and his staff, long aware of the negotiations, acted immediately by ordering German troops to seize control of Northern and Central Italy. The Germans quickly occupied Italy, disarmed the Italian troops and took over all of the Italian Army&#x27;s materials and equipment, meeting only limited resistance. The Germans also dissolved the Italian occupation zone in southeastern France and forced Italian troops stationed there to leave. The Italian armed forces were not given clear orders to resist the Germans after the armistice and so resistance to the German takeover was scattered and of little effect. King Victor Emmanuel made no effort to rally resistance to the Germans, instead fleeing with his retinue to the safety of the Allied lines. On 10 September 1943, after two days of battle between the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the remnants of the Royal Italian Army, Rome fell to the Germans.

The new Italian government had moved Mussolini from place to place while he was in captivity in an attempt to foil any attempts at rescue. Despite this, the Germans eventually pinpointed Mussolini at the Hotel Campo Imperatore at Gran Sasso. On 12 September, Mussolini was freed by the Germans in Operation Eiche (directed by SS-Obersturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny) in the mountains of Abruzzo. After being freed, Mussolini was flown to Bavaria. Gathering what support he still had among the Italian population, his liberation made it possible for a new German-dependent Fascist Italian state to be created.
== Foreign relations ==
=== Establishment by Nazi Germany ===

Three days following his rescue in the Gran Sasso raid, Mussolini was taken to Germany for a meeting with Hitler in Rastenburg at his headquarters in East Prussia. While Mussolini was in poor health and wanted to retire, Hitler wanted him to return to Italy and start a new Fascist state under the protection of the Wehrmacht. Mussolini balked; he was tired of the responsibilities of the war and unwilling to retake power. Hitler told him the alternative would be a German military administration that would treat Italy no differently from other occupied countries. Hitler also threatened to destroy Milan, Genoa and Turin unless Mussolini agreed to set up a revived Fascist government. Reluctantly, Mussolini agreed to Hitler&#x27;s demands.

Mussolini returned to Italy and settled in Milan, from where on 15 September he announced the creation of the Republican Fascist Party and, three days later, the resumption of the war alongside Germany and Japan. The Duce immediately announced the formation of a new republican cabinet, although they actually came from a list chosen and appointed by Hitler himself. The Italian Social Republic was proclaimed on 23 September, with Mussolini as both chief of state and prime minister. The RSI claimed Rome as its capital, but the &quot;de facto&quot; capital became the small town of Salò on Lake Garda, midway between Milan and Venice, where Mussolini resided along with the foreign office of the RSI. While Rome itself was still under Axis control at the time, given the city&#x27;s proximity to Allied lines and the threat of civil unrest, neither the Germans nor Mussolini himself wanted him to return to Rome.

On 18 September, Mussolini made his first public address to the Italian people since his rescue, in which he commended the loyalty of Hitler as an ally while condemning Victor Emmanuel for betraying Italian Fascism. He declared: &quot;It is not the regime that has betrayed the monarchy, it is the monarchy that has betrayed the regime&quot;. He also formally repudiated his previous support of the monarchy, saying: &quot;When a monarchy fails in its duties, it loses every reason for being…The state we want to establish will be national and social in the highest sense of the word; that is, it will be Fascist, thus returning to our origins&quot;.

From the start, the Italian Social Republic was little more than a puppet state dependent entirely upon Germany and a rump state for the Fascists who are still loyal to Mussolini. Mussolini himself knew this; even as he stated in public that he was in full control of the RSI, he was well aware that he was little more than the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Lombardy. The SS kept Mussolini under what amounted to house arrest; it monitored his communications and controlled his travel. Mussolini later said that he would have preferred being sent to a concentration camp to the manner that the SS treated him. Real power rested with German General Plenipotentiary Rudolf Rahn and SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Karl Wolff, the commander of the German occupying forces in Italy.

The RSI had no constitution or organized economy, and its financing was dependent entirely on funding from Berlin. German forces themselves had little respect for Mussolini&#x27;s failed fascism, and considered the regime merely as a tool for maintaining order, such as repressing the Italian partisans. This work was also carried out by the infamous Pietro Koch and the Banda Koch on Germany&#x27;s behalf.

The RSI took revenge against the 19 members who had voted against Mussolini on the Grand Council with the Verona trial (&quot;processo di Verona&quot;) which handed down a death sentence to all of the accused but one. Only six of the 19 were in RSI custody (Giovanni Marinelli, Carlo Pareschi, Luciano Gottardi, Tullio Cianetti, Emilio De Bono and Mussolini&#x27;s own son-in-law Galeazzo Ciano). With the exception of Tullio Cianetti, who received a life sentence, they were all executed on 11 January 1944 in the fort of San Procolo in Verona.

=== Territorial losses ===
The changing political and military situation re-opened questions regarding the status of Italian territories, particularly those with German-speaking majorities that were formerly under Austrian rule. Previously, Hitler had vigorously suppressed any campaigning for the return of lands such as South Tyrol in order to maintain good relations with his Italian ally. In the aftermath of Italy&#x27;s abandonment of the Axis on 8 September 1943, Germany seized and &quot;de facto&quot; incorporated some Italian territories. However, Hitler refused to officially annex South Tyrol in spite of urging by local German officials and instead supported having the RSI hold official sovereignty over these territories and forbade all measures that would give the impression of official annexation of South Tyrol. However, in practice the territory of South Tyrol within the boundaries defined by Germany as &quot;Operationszone Alpenvorland&quot; that included Trento, Bolzano and Belluno were &quot;de facto&quot; incorporated into Germany&#x27;s &quot;Reichsgau Tirol-Vorarlberg&quot; and administered by its &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Franz Hofer. The region identified by Germany as &quot;Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland&quot; that included Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola and Fiume were &quot;de facto&quot; incorporated into &quot;Reichsgau Kärnten&quot; and administered by its &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Friedrich Rainer.

On 10 September 1943, the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) declared that the Treaties of Rome of 18 May 1941 with the Kingdom of Italy were null and void and annexed the portion of Dalmatia that had been ceded to Italy as part of those treaties. The NDH attempted to annex Zara, which had been a recognized territory of Italy since 1919, but Germany prevented the NDH from doing this. Because of these actions, the RSI held the NDH in contempt and refused to have diplomatic relations with the NDH or to recognize its territorial claims.

After the Italian capitulation, the Italian Islands of the Aegean were occupied by the Germans (see Dodecanese campaign). During the German occupation, the islands remained under the nominal sovereignty of the RSI but were &quot;de facto&quot; subject to the German military command.

The Italian concession of Tientsin in China was ceded by the RSI to the Japanese puppet Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China.

=== Diplomatic recognition ===
The RSI was recognized as the legitimate government of Italy by Germany, Japan, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Thailand; it was also recognised by puppet and client States of the Axis, such as the Independent State of Croatia, the Slovak Republic, the Reorganised National Government of the Republic of China and the Empire of Manchuria.

Finland and Vichy France, despite being in the Axis orbit, did not recognise the RSI. Even otherwise sympathetic States such as Spain or Portugal refused to establish formal diplomatic relations with the RSI. The Holy See did not recognise the RSI.

== Economy and war effort ==
During the existence of the Italian Social Republic, Mussolini, whose former government had banned trade unions and strikes, began to make increasingly populist appeals to the working class. He claimed to regret many of the decisions made earlier in supporting the interests of big business and promised a new beginning if the Italian people would be willing to grant him a second chance. Mussolini claimed that he had never totally abandoned his left-wing influences, insisting that he had attempted to nationalize property in 1939–1940 but had been forced to delay such action for tactical reasons related to the war. With the removal of the monarchy, Mussolini claimed the full ideology of Fascism could be pursued; and to gain popular support he reversed over twenty years of Fascist policy of backing private property and relative economic independence by ordering the nationalization of all companies with over 100 employees. Mussolini even reached out to ex-communist Nicola Bombacci to help him in spreading the image that Fascism was a progressive movement. The economic policy of the RSI was given the name &quot;Socialization&quot;, and Mussolini had even considered the idea of calling his new republic the &quot;Italian &#x27;Socialist&#x27; Republic&quot;. In practice, little resulted from the declared socialization of the economy. Unions did not exert real control of their management and took no part in state planning (as they had the power to do on paper after the socialization). The Italian industrial sector was excluded from the new reforms by the Germans and Italian industrialists were opposed to the changes in any case. The Italian labour force (large parts of which had remained leftist despite fascist rule) regarded socialization as a sham and responded with a massive strike on 1 March 1944.

In Greece, while the government of the Kingdom of Italy surrendered and many Italian soldiers in the Aegean were tired of the war and had become opposed to Mussolini, Italian Fascist loyalists remained allied to Germany in the Greek campaign; German forces in Greece convinced 10,000 Italians in the Aegean to continue to support their war effort.

In 1944, Mussolini urged Hitler to focus on destroying Britain rather than the Soviet Union, as Mussolini claimed that it was Britain that had turned the conflict into a world war and that the British Empire must be destroyed in order for peace to come in Europe. Mussolini wanted to conduct a small offensive along the Gothic Line against the Allies with his new RSI Divisions; in December 1944, the Alpine Division &quot;Monte Rosa&quot; with some German battalions fought the Battle of Garfagnana with some success. As the situation became desperate, with Allied forces in control of most of Italy and from February 1945 resumed pushing the Axis forces north of the Gothic Line, Mussolini declared that &quot;he would fight to the last Italian&quot; and spoke of turning Milan into the &quot;Stalingrad of Italy&quot;, where Fascism would make its last glorious fight. Despite such strong rhetoric, Mussolini considered evacuating Fascists into Switzerland, although this was opposed by Germany, which instead proposed that Mussolini and key Fascist officials be taken into exile in Germany. Further disintegration of support for his government occurred as fascist and German military officials secretly tried to negotiate a truce with Allied forces, without consulting either Mussolini or Hitler.

== RSI military formations ==

=== Army ===

Smaller units like the Black Brigades (&quot;Brigate nere&quot;) led by Alessandro Pavolini and the Decima Flottiglia MAS led by Junio Valerio Borghese (called &quot;principe nero&quot;, the Black Prince) fought for the RSI during its entire existence. The Germans were satisfied if these units were able to participate in anti-partisan activities.

In March 1944, the bulk of the 1st Italian volunteers Storm Brigade were sent to the Anzio beachhead, where they fought alongside their German allies, receiving favourable reports and taking heavy losses. In recognition of their performance, Heinrich Himmler declared the unit to be fully integrated into the Waffen SS.

On 16 October 1943, the Rastenburg Protocol was signed with Nazi Germany and the RSI was allowed to raise division-sized military formations. This protocol allowed Marshal Rodolfo Graziani to raise four RSI divisions totalling 52,000 men. In July 1944, the first of these divisions completed training and was sent to the front.

Recruiting military forces was difficult for the RSI as most of the Italian Army had been interned by German forces in 1943, many military-aged Italians had been conscripted into forced labour in Germany and few wanted to participate in the war. The RSI became so desperate for soldiers that it granted convicts freedom if they would join the army and imposed a sentence of death on anyone who opposed being conscripted. Autonomous military forces in the RSI also fought against the Allies including the notorious Decima Flottiglia MAS of Prince Junio Valerio Borghese. Borghese held no allegiance to Mussolini and even suggested that he would take him prisoner if he could.

During the winter of 1944–1945, armed Italians were on both sides of the Gothic Line. On the Allied side were four Italian groups of volunteers from the old Italian army. These Italian volunteers were equipped and trained by the British. On the Axis side were four RSI divisions. Three of the RSI divisions, the 2nd Grenadier Division &quot;Littorio&quot;, the 3rd Italian &quot;San Marco&quot; Marine Division and the 4th Italian &quot;Monterosa&quot; Alpini Division were allocated to the LXXXXVII &quot;Liguria&quot; Army under Graziani and were placed to guard the western flank of the Gothic Line facing France. The fourth RSI division, the 1st Italian &quot;Italia&quot; Infantry Division, was attached to the German 14th Army in a sector of the Apennine Mountains thought least likely to be attacked.

On 26 December 1944, several sizeable RSI military units, including elements of the 4th Italian &quot;Monterosa Division&quot; Alpine Division and the 3rd Italian &quot;San Marco&quot; Marine Division, participated in Operation Winter Storm. This was a combined German and Italian offensive against the United States Army&#x27;s 92nd Infantry Division. The battle was fought in the Apennines. While limited in scale, this was a successful offensive and the RSI units did their part.

The RSI military was under the command of General Alfredo Guzzoni while Field Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, the former governor-general of Italian Libya, was the RSI&#x27;s Minister of Defense and commander-in-chief of the combined German-Italian Army Group Liguria. Mussolini, as &quot;Duce&quot; and head of state of RSI assumed supreme command over all military forces of the RSI.

In February 1945, the 92nd Infantry Division again came up against RSI units. This time it was Bersaglieri of the 1st Italian &quot;Italia&quot; Infantry Division. The Italians successfully halted the United States division&#x27;s advance.

However, the situation continued to deteriorate for the Axis forces on Gothic Line. By mid-April 1945, the final Allied offensive in Italy had led German defences to collapse. At the end of that month, the last remaining troops of RSI were bottled up along with two Wehrmacht divisions at Collecchio by 1st Brazilian Division being forced to surrender after some days of fighting.

On 29 April, Graziani surrendered and was present at Caserta when a representative of German General Heinrich von Vietinghoff-Scheel signed the unconditional instrument of surrender for all Axis forces in Italy, but since the Allies had never recognised the RSI Graziani&#x27;s signature was not required at Caserta. The surrender was to take effect on 2 May; Graziani ordered all RSI forces under his command to lay down their arms on 1 May.

=== Air Force ===

The National Republican Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; or ANR) was the air force of Italian Social Republic and also the air unit of National Republican Army. It was organized into three fighter groups, one torpedo bomber group, one bomber group, and other transport and minor units. The ANR worked closely with the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) in Northern Italy.

In 1944, after the withdrawal of all German fighter units for home air defense over Germany, ANR fighter groups were left alone and heavily outnumbered to face the massive Allied air offensive over Northern Italy. During 1944 and 1945, the ANR shot down 262 Allied aircraft for the loss in action of 158 of its own.

=== Navy ===

Little of the Italian (Royal Navy) joined the RSI. This was because the bulk of the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; was ordered to steam to Malta at the time of the September 1943 armistice, where it was out of the reach of the Germans and the RSI. The RSI&#x27;s National Republican Navy (&quot;Marina Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; or MNR) only reached a twentieth the size of the Italian Co-belligerent Navy that fought on the Allied side after the September 1943 armistice. The National Republican Navy consisted of nine motor torpedo boats (two large and seven small) and dozens of MTSM small motor torpedo boats and MTM explosive motorboats. The National Republican Navy also operated 15 &quot;CB&quot;-class midget submarines (ten in the Adriatic Sea and five in the Black Sea) and one larger submarine, &quot;CM1&quot;.

Troops of the Decima Flottiglia MAS (the elite Italian frogman corps) fought primarily as a land unit of the RSI.

Some of the naval personnel at the BETASOM submarine base in Bordeaux, France, remained loyal to Mussolini.

=== Paramilitaries ===
The fall of the Fascist regime in Italy and the disbandment of the MVSN or &quot;Blackshirts&quot; saw the establishment of the National Republican Guard (&quot;Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; or GNR) and the Republican Police Corps (&quot;Corpo di Polizia Repubblicana&quot;) and the emergence of the Black Brigades (&quot;brigate nere&quot;). The GNR consisted of former OVRA, carabinieri, soldiers, Italian Africa Police, and others still loyal to the Fascist cause, while the Republican Police Corps was the successor agency of the public security complex formed by the Directorate of Public Security and the Public Security Agents Corps. The Black Brigade was formed by the new fascist party members both young and old. Both units fought alongside Nazi &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) counterparts against the Italian resistance movement in an extensive anti-partisan war. The Black Brigades committed many atrocities in their fight against the Italian resistance movement and political enemies. On 15 August 1944, the GNR became part of the National Republican Army.

=== Labour battalions ===

The &quot;Ispettorato Militare del Lavoro&quot; (&quot;ILM&quot;), informally called the &quot;Organizzazione Paladino&quot; or &quot;Azione Graziani&quot;, was an organization of the Italian Social Republic during World War II composed of volunteer labourers &quot;to collaborate with the German authorities in repairing roads and railways, and in general carry out other work of either a civil or military nature.&quot; The organization was proposed by General Francesco Paladino. With German agreement, Marshal Rodolfo Graziani appointed Paladino its first director on 6 October 1943. Its headquarters was initially in Rome and it was under the authority of the Ministry of Defence.

=== Women auxiliary service ===
Women volunteers served in uniform as noncombatants in paramilitary units and police formations (&quot;Servizio Ausiliario Femminile&quot;). The commander was the brigadier general Piera Gatteschi Fondelli.

== Government ==
The Government of the Italian Social Republic held office from 23 September 1943 until 25 April 1945, a total of . Its head was Benito Mussolini.

The Government wrote a constitution for the Italian Social Republic, but it was never discussed or approved. On 13 October 1943, the Government announced that a Constituent Assembly would be called to write a new constitution, but that was cancelled by Mussolini on 14 November 1943 and delayed until after the end of the war. The disintegration of the Italian Social Republic at the end of the war meant that no new constitution was written.

The RSI was led by the Republican Fascist Party, established on 18 September 1943 out of the disbanded National Fascist Party. The party&#x27;s official newspaper was &quot;Il Lavoro Fascista&quot;, formerly the publication of Fascist trade unions; Mussolini was largely indifferent toward the new paper and generally wrote on the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; instead. The &quot;Duce&quot; explicitly refused to revive his former newspaper &quot;Il Popolo d&#x27;Italia&quot;, not willing to let it become a mouthpiece of the German occupation.

On 14 February 1945, Mussolini authorized the formation of a second political party called the National Republican Socialist Rally (RNRS, later rebranded as the Italian Socialist Republican Party) under the leadership of Edmondo Cione. The party supported a leftist view of fascism strongly focused on the socialization of the economy, and included several former socialists, such as Pulvio Zocchi, Carlo Silvestri, and Walter Mocchi; it also published a newspaper called &quot;L&#x27;Italia del Popolo&quot;. It was politically insignificant and its membership is unknown. Mussolini himself privately told German ambassador Rudolf Rahn that he only authorised the formation of the RNRS in an attempt to sway some working-class voters away from the National Liberation Committee and that it was never meant to create any real political pluralism.

== Legacy ==
=== In post-war Italian politics ===
While the RSI supported Nazi Germany, it allowed the Italian Fascist movement to build a completely totalitarian state. During the preceding twenty years of the Fascist association with the Savoy monarchy of the Kingdom of Italy, some of the actions of the Fascists had been restricted by the monarchy. However, the formation of the RSI allowed Mussolini to be the official head of an Italian state and it also allowed the Fascists to return to their earlier republican stances. In one way or another, most of the prominent leaders of the post-war Italian far-right (parliamentary and extraparliamentary) were associated with the experience of the RSI. Among them were Filippo Anfuso, Pino Romualdi, Rodolfo Graziani, Junio Valerio Borghese, Licio Gelli, and Giorgio Almirante. Most of the 8,000 Italian Jews who died in the Holocaust in Italy were killed during the 20 months of the Salò regime.

=== Stamps ===
A number of postage stamps were issued by the Republic of Salò. Initially, existing Italian issues were overprinted with a fasces, or the initials &quot;G.N.R.&quot; for the Republican National Guard. Later the government designed and printed three series, all of which are very common.

=== Currency ===
Banknotes in 50, 100, 500, and 1000 lire denomination were printed by the Republic. As issuer, the country was not mentioned on them, but rather only the Bank of Italy.

=== In the arts ===
Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot; is an adaptation of Marquis de Sade&#x27;s &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot;, set in the Republic of Salò instead of 18th-century France. It uses the source material as an allegory; the atrocities in the movie did not actually happen, while most of the choices of milieus, clothing, uniforms, weapons and other details are historically correct. Roberto Benigni&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; is also set in the Republic of Salò.

Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1976 &quot;Novecento&quot; set his story in Emilia, being at the time a province of the Italian Social Republic, even though this is never mentioned in the movie. &quot;Wild Blood&quot; tells the true story of the Fascist film stars Luisa Ferida and Osvaldo Valenti and their support for the Republic.

Futurist writer and poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, a Mussolini loyalist who had helped shape Fascist philosophy, remained in the RSI as a propagandist until his death from a heart attack at Bellagio in December 1944.

<text>In geometry, an isosceles triangle () is a triangle that has two sides of equal length and two angles of equal measure. Sometimes it is specified as having &quot;exactly&quot; two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having &quot;at least&quot; two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.
Examples of isosceles triangles include the isosceles right triangle, the golden triangle, and the faces of bipyramids and certain Catalan solids.

The mathematical study of isosceles triangles dates back to ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics. Isosceles triangles have been used as decoration from even earlier times, and appear frequently in architecture and design, for instance in the pediments and gables of buildings.

The two equal sides are called the &quot;legs&quot; and the third side is called the &quot;base&quot; of the triangle. The other dimensions of the triangle, such as its height, area, and perimeter, can be calculated by simple formulas from the lengths of the legs and base. Every isosceles triangle has reflection symmetry across the perpendicular bisector of its base, which passes through the opposite vertex and divides the triangle into a pair of congruent right triangles. The two equal angles at the base (opposite the legs) are always acute, so the classification of the triangle as acute, right, or obtuse depends only on the angle between its two legs.

==Terminology, classification, and examples==
Euclid defined an isosceles triangle as a triangle with exactly two equal sides, but modern treatments prefer to define isosceles triangles as having at least two equal sides. The difference between these two definitions is that the modern version makes equilateral triangles (with three equal sides) a special case of isosceles triangles. A triangle that is not isosceles (having three unequal sides) is called scalene.
&quot;Isosceles&quot; is made from the Greek roots &quot;isos&quot; (equal) and &quot;skelos&quot; (leg). The same word is used, for instance, for isosceles trapezoids, trapezoids with two equal sides, and for isosceles sets, sets of points every three of which form an isosceles triangle.

In an isosceles triangle that has exactly two equal sides, the equal sides are called legs and the third side is called the base. The angle included by the legs is called the &quot;vertex angle&quot; and the angles that have the base as one of their sides are called the &quot;base angles&quot;. The vertex opposite the base is called the apex. In the equilateral triangle case, since all sides are equal, any side can be called the base.


Whether an isosceles triangle is acute, right or obtuse depends only on the angle at its apex. In Euclidean geometry, the base angles can not be obtuse (greater than 90°) or right (equal to 90°) because their measures would sum to at least 180°, the total of all angles in any Euclidean triangle. Since a triangle is obtuse or right if and only if one of its angles is obtuse or right, respectively, an isosceles triangle is obtuse, right or acute if and only if its apex angle is respectively obtuse, right or acute. In Edwin Abbott&#x27;s book &quot;Flatland&quot;, this classification of shapes was used as a satire of social hierarchy: isosceles triangles represented the working class, with acute isosceles triangles higher in the hierarchy than right or obtuse isosceles triangles.

As well as the isosceles right triangle, several other specific shapes of isosceles triangles have been studied.
These include the Calabi triangle (a triangle with three congruent inscribed squares), the golden triangle and golden gnomon (two isosceles triangles whose sides and base are in the golden ratio), the 80-80-20 triangle appearing in the Langley&#x27;s Adventitious Angles puzzle, and the 30-30-120 triangle of the triakis triangular tiling.
Five Catalan solids, the triakis tetrahedron, triakis octahedron, tetrakis hexahedron, pentakis dodecahedron, and triakis icosahedron, each have isosceles-triangle faces, as do infinitely many pyramids and bipyramids.

==Formulas==
===Height===
For any isosceles triangle, the following six line segments coincide:
*the altitude, a line segment from the apex perpendicular to the base,
*the angle bisector from the apex to the base,
*the median from the apex to the midpoint of the base,
*the perpendicular bisector of the base within the triangle,
*the segment within the triangle of the unique axis of symmetry of the triangle, and
*the segment within the triangle of the Euler line of the triangle, except when the triangle is equilateral.
Their common length is the height formula_1 of the triangle.
If the triangle has equal sides of length formula_2 and base of length formula_3,
the general triangle formulas for 
the lengths of these segments all simplify to
:formula_4
This formula can also be derived from the Pythagorean theorem using the fact that the altitude bisects the base and partitions the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles.

The Euler line of any triangle goes through the triangle&#x27;s orthocenter (the intersection of its three altitudes), its centroid (the intersection of its three medians), and its circumcenter (the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of its three sides, which is also the center of the circumcircle that passes through the three vertices). In an isosceles triangle with exactly two equal sides, these three points are distinct, and (by symmetry) all lie on the symmetry axis of the triangle, from which it follows that the Euler line coincides with the axis of symmetry. The incenter of the triangle also lies on the Euler line, something that is not true for other triangles. If any two of an angle bisector, median, or altitude coincide in a given triangle, that triangle must be isosceles.

===Area===
The area formula_5 of an isosceles triangle can be derived from the formula for its height, and from the general formula for the area of a triangle as half the product of base and height:
:formula_6
The same area formula can also be derived from Heron&#x27;s formula for the area of a triangle from its three sides. However, applying Heron&#x27;s formula directly can be numerically unstable for isosceles triangles with very sharp angles, because of the near-cancellation between the semiperimeter and side length in those triangles.

If the apex angle formula_7 and leg lengths formula_8 of an isosceles triangle are known, then the area of that triangle is:
:formula_9
This is a special case of the general formula for the area of a triangle as half the product of two sides times the sine of the included angle.

===Perimeter===
The perimeter formula_10 of an isosceles triangle with equal sides formula_2 and base formula_3 is just
:formula_13
As in any triangle, the area formula_5 and perimeter formula_10 are related by the isoperimetric inequality
:formula_16
This is a strict inequality for isosceles triangles with sides unequal to the base, and becomes an equality for the equilateral triangle.
The area, perimeter, and base can also be related to each other by the equation
:formula_17
If the base and perimeter are fixed, then this formula determines the area of the resulting isosceles triangle, which is the maximum possible among all triangles with the same base and perimeter.
On the other hand, if the area and perimeter are fixed, this formula can be used to recover the base length, but not uniquely: there are in general two distinct isosceles triangles with given area formula_5 and perimeter formula_10. When the isoperimetric inequality becomes an equality, there is only one such triangle, which is equilateral.

===Angle bisector length===
If the two equal sides have length formula_2 and the other side has length formula_3, then the internal angle bisector formula_22 from one of the two equal-angled vertices satisfies
:formula_23
as well as
:formula_24
and conversely, if the latter condition holds, an isosceles triangle parametrized by formula_2 and formula_22 exists.

The Steiner–Lehmus theorem states that every triangle with two angle bisectors of equal lengths is isosceles. It was formulated in 1840 by C. L. Lehmus. Its other namesake, Jakob Steiner, was one of the first to provide a solution.
Although originally formulated only for internal angle bisectors, it works for many (but not all) cases when, instead, two external angle bisectors are equal.
The 30-30-120 isosceles triangle makes a boundary case for this variation of the theorem, as it has four equal angle bisectors (two internal, two external).

===Radii===

The inradius and circumradius formulas for an isosceles triangle may be derived from their formulas for arbitrary triangles.
The radius of the inscribed circle of an isosceles triangle with side length formula_2, base formula_3, and height formula_1 is:
:formula_30
The center of the circle lies on the symmetry axis of the triangle, this distance above the base.
An isosceles triangle has the largest possible inscribed circle among the triangles with the same base and apex angle, as well as also having the largest area and perimeter among the same class of triangles.

The radius of the circumscribed circle is:
:formula_31
The center of the circle lies on the symmetry axis of the triangle, this distance below the apex.

===Inscribed square===
For any isosceles triangle, there is a unique square with one side collinear with the base of the triangle and the opposite two corners on its sides. The Calabi triangle is a special isosceles triangle with the property that the other two inscribed squares, with sides collinear with the sides of the triangle,
are of the same size as the base square. A much older theorem, preserved in the works of Hero of Alexandria,
states that, for an isosceles triangle with base formula_3 and height formula_1, the side length of the inscribed square on the base of the triangle is
:formula_34

==Isosceles subdivision of other shapes==

For any integer formula_35, any triangle can be partitioned into formula_36 isosceles triangles.
In a right triangle, the median from the hypotenuse (that is, the line segment from the midpoint of the hypotenuse to the right-angled vertex) divides the right triangle into two isosceles triangles. This is because the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the center of the circumcircle of the right triangle, and each of the two triangles created by the partition has two equal radii as two of its sides.
Similarly, an acute triangle can be partitioned into three isosceles triangles by segments from its circumcenter, but this method does not work for obtuse triangles, because the circumcenter lies outside the triangle.

Generalizing the partition of an acute triangle, any cyclic polygon that contains the center of its circumscribed circle can be partitioned into isosceles triangles by the radii of this circle through its vertices. The fact that all radii of a circle have equal length implies that all of these triangles are isosceles. This partition can be used to derive a formula for the area of the polygon as a function of its side lengths, even for cyclic polygons that do not contain their circumcenters. This formula generalizes Heron&#x27;s formula for triangles and Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula for cyclic quadrilaterals.

Either diagonal of a rhombus divides it into two congruent isosceles triangles. Similarly, one of the two diagonals of
a kite divides it into two isosceles triangles, which are not congruent except when the kite is a rhombus.

==Applications==
===In architecture and design===

Isosceles triangles commonly appear in architecture as the shapes of gables and pediments. In ancient Greek architecture and its later imitations, the obtuse isosceles triangle was used; in Gothic architecture this was replaced by the acute isosceles triangle.

In the architecture of the Middle Ages, another isosceles triangle shape became popular: the Egyptian isosceles triangle. This is an isosceles triangle that is acute, but less so than the equilateral triangle; its height is proportional to 5/8 of its base. The Egyptian isosceles triangle was brought back into use in modern architecture by Dutch architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage.
Warren truss structures, such as bridges, are commonly arranged in isosceles triangles, although sometimes vertical beams are also included for additional strength.
Surfaces tessellated by obtuse isosceles triangles can be used to form deployable structures that have two stable states: an unfolded state in which the surface expands to a cylindrical column, and a folded state in which it folds into a more compact prism shape that can be more easily transported. The same tessellation pattern forms the basis of Yoshimura buckling, a pattern formed when cylindrical surfaces are axially compressed, and of the Schwarz lantern, an example used in mathematics to show that the area of a smooth surface cannot always be accurately approximated by polyhedra converging to the surface.
In graphic design and the decorative arts, isosceles triangles have been a frequent design element in cultures around the world from at least the Early Neolithic to modern times. They are a common design element in flags and heraldry, appearing prominently with a vertical base, for instance, in the flag of Guyana, or with a horizontal base in the flag of Saint Lucia, where they form a stylized image of a mountain island.

They also have been used in designs with religious or mystic significance, for instance in the Sri Yantra of Hindu meditational practice.

===In other areas of mathematics===
If a cubic equation with real coefficients has three roots that are not all real numbers, then when these roots are plotted in the complex plane as an Argand diagram they form vertices of an isosceles triangle whose axis of symmetry coincides with the horizontal (real) axis. This is because the complex roots are complex conjugates and hence are symmetric about the real axis.

In celestial mechanics, the three-body problem has been studied in the special case that the three bodies form an isosceles triangle, because assuming that the bodies are arranged in this way reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the system without reducing it to the solved Lagrangian point case when the bodies form an equilateral triangle. The first instances of the three-body problem shown to have unbounded oscillations were in the isosceles three-body problem.

==History and fallacies==
Long before isosceles triangles were studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians, the practitioners of Ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics knew how to calculate their area. Problems of this type are included in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.

The theorem that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal appears as Proposition I.5 in Euclid. This result has been called the &quot;pons asinorum&quot; (the bridge of asses) or the isosceles triangle theorem. Rival explanations for this name include the theory that it is because the diagram used by Euclid in his demonstration of the result resembles a bridge, or because this is the first difficult result in Euclid, and acts to separate those who can understand Euclid&#x27;s geometry from those who cannot.

A well-known fallacy is the false proof of the statement that &quot;all triangles are isosceles&quot;, first published by W. W. Rouse Ball in 1892, and later republished in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Lewis Carroll Picture Book&quot;. The fallacy is rooted in Euclid&#x27;s lack of recognition of the concept of &quot;betweenness&quot; and the resulting ambiguity of &quot;inside&quot; versus &quot;outside&quot; of figures.

<text>A study Bible is an edition of the Bible prepared for use by a serious student of the Bible. It provides scholarly information designed to help the reader gain a better understanding of and context for the text.

==History==
Perhaps the first edition of an English language Bible that qualified as a &quot;study Bible&quot; was the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; published by Sir Rowland Hill in 1560; it contained extensive cross-references, synopses, and doctrinal points. The text of the Geneva Bible was usually not printed without the commentary, though the Cambridge edition was printed without commentary.

The Church of England disputed some of the statements made in the Geneva Bible annotations. This led to the creation of the &quot;King James Bible&quot;, which was typically printed with a much less extensive apparatus or none at all. Several commentators have supplied annotated King James Bibles containing their own points of view, but unlike the Geneva Bible, these commentaries are not as thoroughly integrated into the text.

Another historically significant study Bible was the &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot;, first printed by Cyrus Scofield in 1909. This study Bible became widely popular in the United States, where it spread the interpretation system known as dispensationalism among fundamentalist Christians. A new version, the Recovery Version, was published in 1985. It holds a similar interpretation, and this study Bible has a very large number of cross-references and explanatory and interpretative footnotes.

Nearly all Catholic Bibles have explanatory and interpretative footnotes. For example, the &quot;Jerusalem Bible&quot; is a widely respected study Bible originally made by French monks in Jerusalem, under the auspices of the Catholic Church. The original French edition of 1961 became the basis of versions of this study Bible in several other languages, including English, revised as the &quot;New Jerusalem Bible&quot;; some versions have more extensive notes than others.

Logos International published the &quot;Logos International Study Bible&quot; in 1972. Based on the 1901 &quot;American Standard Version&quot;, it is essentially an updated version of &quot;The Cross-Reference Bible&quot;, published before 1929 and edited by Harold E. Monser. It includes an unusually large number of cross-references, in-text articles, and treatment of variant readings.

Zondervan claims that its &quot;NIV Study Bible&quot; has six million in distribution and that it is the world&#x27;s best selling study Bible.

The &quot;ESV Study Bible&quot; is a recent addition which sold well in its pre-release phase, in the fall of 2008.

In recent times, study Bibles focusing on specific aspects of the Biblical message, have appeared, such as &quot;The Green Bible&quot;, an English version of the &quot;New Revised Standard Version Bible&quot; (originally published by Harper Bibles on October 7, 2008), which focuses on environmental issues and teachings.

==Features==
A study Bible usually contains such features as:

* Annotations explaining difficult passages or points of theology and doctrine
* Articles and short biographies or character studies of Biblical people, places, and topics
* A concordance, a word index that indicates where various keywords are used in the Bible
* Contextual setting, including discussion of culture, customs, history, and timelines that relate Bible history to world history
* Harmonies of the Gospels, pointing out parallel incidents in the life of Jesus
* Illustrations of locations and artifacts
* Introductions and historical notes for each book of the Bible
* Life/practical application
* Maps and charts that illustrate the Holy Land during Biblical times and may show the same areas today
* References or cross-references, to indicate where one passage of the text relates to others
* Variant readings or interpretations of certain debatable passages, or possible conjectural emendations (i.e., alterations based on a philological expert&#x27;s &quot;educated guess&quot; of the likely form of the original Hebrew or Greek, when the translators feel this is not sufficiently clear, possible translations from other ancient versions such as the Septuagint, Targumim, Peshitta, and Vulgate, readings from other manuscript families, such as marking those passages missing which are present in the Byzantine text-type in a modern textual eclectic translation, or marking those passages present which are missing in the Alexandrian text-type and the modern critical text in a translation from the Textus Receptus or Byzantine text-type, etc.)
* Word definitions to explain difficult or complex words and ideas

==Study Bible software==

Study Bible software is also available which can aid readers in the study of the Bible. This software normally includes several Bible translations, commentaries, Bible Dictionaries, maps and other content. They also include search engines to enable users to find Bible passages by keyword and by theme.

<text>Gamlingay is a village and civil parish in the South Cambridgeshire district of Cambridgeshire, England, about west southwest of Cambridge.

The 2011 census gives the village&#x27;s population as 3,247 and the civil parish&#x27;s as 3,568.

In addition to Gamlingay village, the parish includes the outlying areas of Gamlingay Cinques, Gamlingay Great Heath and Little Heath.

==History==
An ancient village listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, the name comes from the Old English &quot;Gamelingei&quot;, meaning &quot;the enclosure of Gamela&#x27;s people&quot;.

There has been a settlement on the site since the middle Bronze Age and there are signs of occupation from the middle Stone Age. The village may have first been established around a central green south of the High Street (now known as Church Street); a complex of medieval buildings stood at the east end of the green, but only a tithe barn and the house known as &#x27;Emplins&#x27; remain today. Another focal point was provided by the crossroads at the other end of Church Street and houses spread to the south and east of the junction. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Gamlingay grew to the east towards Dutter End and west to Green End. By 1871, Gamlingay had a population twice as large as that of the hundred&#x27;s second-largest parish, Bourn.

Gamlingay is steeped in history, with many listed buildings in the village. The stone for building the church was from a quarry within the village. This quarry then offered the perfect location for an archery range. Being dug into the ground it was a safe area where archery could be practised, and thus was named &#x27;The Butts&#x27;. In medieval times it was a requirement that all men over a certain age were capable of using a bow and arrow. The Butts is now a children&#x27;s play area.

Throughout history, Gamlingay has been a farming village. Most of the village was owned by the Oxford college Merton, and the Cambridge colleges Downing and Clare. Until a few years ago, the houses at Gamlingay Village College were named after Merton, Downing and Clare. Downing College acquired the land as a result of a bequest in the will of Sir George Downing, who lived in a mansion, Gamlingay Park, on his Gamlingay estate.

In 1600, 64 houses – comprising much of the village – were destroyed in the &quot;Great Fire of Gamlingay&quot;, as described in an extract of a letter from the Privy Council to Sir Thomas Egerton:

&quot;Whereas divers of the Justices of the Peace in the countie of Cambridge have certyfied us the lamentable accydent that hath fallen upon the inhabitantes of Gamlingay in the said countie, by casualltie of fire that happned on the 21St daie of Aprill last, whereby the moste parte of the said towne to the nomber of 76 houses with divers barnes and stackes of corne were suddainlie consumed.&quot;

By 1844, Gamlingay had five inns, including the Cock (dating from at least 1588), the Rose &amp; Crown (1622) and the Blue Ball (1770s). The Sultan was built near the station in 1867. 

Gamlingay railway station on the Bedford and Cambridge branch of the London and North Western Railway, was in operation from 1862 until 1968.

==Governance==
There are 15 councillors on Gamlingay Parish Council. The parish is represented on South Cambridgeshire District Council by one councillor for the Gamlingay ward and on Cambridgeshire County Council by one councillor for the Gamlingay electoral division. It is in the parliamentary constituency of South Cambridgeshire. 

==Geography==
Gamlingay is 14 miles (22 km) west of the county town of Cambridge, five miles (9 km) south-east of St Neots and 45 miles (72 km) north of London. It is north of the small town of Potton and south-west of Waresley. The parish ranges from 39 metres (along the Millbridge Brook) to 73 metres (near Potton Wood) above sea level. The village is at around 50 metres. Most of the central parish is on the Lower Greensand; the soil in the eastern part of the parish is clay with gault subsoil. Two nature reserves, Gamlingay Wood and Gamlingay Cinques Common (registered Town and Village Green No. 39) can be found in the parish, the former and the latter being a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a County Wildlife Site respectively.

By the 12th century, heathland had developed on the Lower Greensand and the poor drainage of the soil there meant there were two quaking bogs, on Gamlingay Heath (drained in 1855) and Cinques Common. Treeplanting and pig rearing after inclosure in 1844 altered the landscape.

Woodbury used to be in the parish but was transferred to Bedfordshire in 1965 and a hamlet named Newton on the Heath had disappeared by 1279.

==Demography==
At the time of the 2001 census, Gamlingay parish had 3,535 inhabitants living in 1,410 households. The ethnic group of 99% was white, with 0.4% Asian or Asian British, 0.1% black or Black British, 0.3% mixed and 0.2% other. 77% were Christian, 0.3% followed another religion and 22% cited &#x27;no religion&#x27; or did not state one.

==Economy==
Gamlingay is now largely a commuter village: 44% of its employed residents work outside of Cambridgeshire, 30% more than 20 km away and 11% more than 40 km away.

Farming, mainly arable, was the primary employer in Gamlingay for many centuries. A third of the parish was cultivated in 1801, with wheat the main crop, then barley and peas. In 1937, there were 12 smallholders and 11 market gardeners. There was some gravel extraction south of the village in the late 19th century; in 1864 the village had three brickworks. In 1912, one occupied an area of 31 acres (12.5 hectares), with 12 kilns and a warehouse capable of holding 500,000 bricks. The closure of the brick and tile works probably caused the parish&#x27;s population to fall in the aftermath of its sale in 1920.

==Landmarks==

A war memorial, built from Cornish granite, now stands within the new cemetery having been resited from its former position outside Gamlingay Village College and commemorates men from the village who died in the First and Second World Wars.

Two timber-framed buildings in the village date from the late 15th or early 16th centuries: Emplins, a large house near the church, and Merton Manor Farm. A total of 60 buildings in Gamlingay parish are listed, including the Baptist chapel on Stocks Lane, Merton Grange, the Cock Inn, a red telephone box outside the church, and many buildings along Church Street, and 10 north lane

==Education==
Until 2017, Gamlingay children were educated under the neighbouring Bedfordshire three-tier system but the village aligned with the nationally recognised two-tier system from September 2017. Gamlingay children aged 4–11 years are now educated at Gamlingay Village Primary, part of the Cam Academy Trust. (As Gamlingay Village College it was previously a Middle school and admitted pupils aged from 9–13). Secondary education follows at Comberton Village College (also a Cam Academy Trust school), Ofsted rated Outstanding, with free school bus provided for 11 - 16 year olds. The nearest secondary schools are Sandy Secondary School and Stratton Upper School, Biggleswade.

==Religious sites==

Gamlingay parish church the Church of St Mary is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. It was built around the 12th century in the Early English style with a square tower (now containing eight bells) from field stones and local ironstone. A church existed in the parish before 1120. Gamlingay is part of the ecclesiastical parish of &quot;Gamlingay with Hatley St George and East Hatley&quot;.

The village&#x27;s first Baptist church was formed in 1670. Its first recorded minister was John Bunyan, the author of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. In the beginning the church, which was originally known as Gamlingay Old Meeting, was a daughter congregation of Bunyan Meeting at Bedford, becoming independent in 1710. The meeting house was also built in 1710. It was rebuilt in 1840 and restored in 1881. The church was renamed Gamlingay Baptist Church in the 1990s and they continue to meet at 10.45 every Sunday.

There was also an Anglican mission church at Gamlingay Heath dedicated to St Sylvester, originally constructed in iron in 1879, which closed in the 1980s.

A congregation of Particular Baptists worshipped at a chapel known as Zoar, built around 1800 at Gamlingay Cinques; it was demolished in the mid-1960s. A Primitive Methodist chapel was built at Green End in 1855.

==Community amenities==
Local amenities include a gym, two pubs, shops, two hairdressers, sports fields, a community centre, clubs and societies, cinema, nursery schools and a Grade II listed telephone box.

Gamlingay is also home to Gamlingay Eco Hub and has its own community music charity, Gamlingay Records.

<doc id="315439" wikidata="Q2167664" url="?curid=315439" title="Abbots Bromley">
<text>Abbots Bromley is a village and civil parish in the East Staffordshire district of Staffordshire and lies approximately east of Stafford, England. According to the University of Nottingham English Place-names project, the settlement name Abbots Bromley could mean &#x27;clearing/wood frequented by broom&#x27;. The prefix &#x27;abbots&#x27; was added because the village was held by Burton Abbey. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,779.

Abbots Bromley was rated the best place to live in the Midlands by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in 2013 and again in 2016. The village is a regular entrant and often winner of the Staffordshire Best Kept Village Competition which takes place across the county each year. Originally organised by the Community Council of Staffordshire there is a best-kept village award for a large and small village in each of the county&#x27;s Districts and Boroughs. Whilst down the years the East Staffordshire district prize has been awarded to Abbots Bromley on a number of occasions the overall county title continues to elude. In August 2017 the village won the double honour of winning both the best kept village and community council trophy award, a double not achieved for many years. This double was repeated again in 2018. In 2019 the competition was taken on by The Community Foundation for Staffordshire and Abbots Bromley won for the third consecutive year. Through the competition Abbots Bromley maintains a healthy rivalry with nearby Yoxall, also a regular winner in the East Staffordshire section.

The village is world-renowned for its annual Horn Dance, an ancient tradition which attracts visitors from far and wide.

== Location ==
The village sits within the Postal Area of the nearby settlement of Rugeley which is the closest town to the village at from Abbots Bromley. The village and civil parish lie within the East Staffordshire District. The village is north of the city of Lichfield and is south west of Uttoxeter. The nearest railway station is at Rugeley which is south west of the village. The Blithfield Reservoir is from the centre of the village. Within the parish there are the natural features of Bagot&#x27;s Wood and the largest remaining part of the Needwood Forest. Phil Drabble&#x27;s Goats Lodge nature reserve is also in the parish. Chaserider hourly bus service 63 links the village to Uttoxeter, Rugeley, Hednesford and Cannock.

==History==
The first historical record of the village dates from 942, when the manor of &quot;Bromleage&quot; was given to Wulfsige the Black. The will, dated 1002, of Wulfric Spot, Earl of Mercia, gave the village to the Abbey of Burton upon Trent. There is some evidence that the current settlement was a planned town – there is evidence of burgage plots, a grid pattern of streets and a wide market place.

=== &quot;Domesday Book&quot; ===
Abbas Bromley is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086–7 as &quot;Brunlege&quot;, when it was part of the land of St Mary of Burton.

=== Royal Charter ===
In 1227, a weekly market was confirmed by Royal Charter at the site of the Buttercross (recorded in 1339, the present structure said by Pevsner to date from the 17th century), which survives to the present. The current, triangular market place is now grassed over and serves as a village green and the focus for events on Horn Dance Day.

=== Dissolution of the Monasteries ===
The village remained affiliated to the Abbey till the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1545. Henry VIII gave &quot;Bromley Abbatis&quot; to Sir William Paget, Clerk of the Signet and Privy Councillor. The village was known as &quot;Paget&#x27;s Bromley&quot; for several centuries, (distinguishing it from the part of the parish in the hands of the Bagot family, still known as &quot;Bagot&#x27;s Bromley&quot;) but eventually the influence of the Paget family declined, and the name reverted to &quot;Abbots Bromley&quot;.

=== Industry ===
Despite being an agricultural centre on account of its market and fairs, Abbots Bromley enjoyed some industrial success. In the 16th century it was a major centre for glass manufacture. In 1606 it gained a grammar school, now Richard Clarke First School.

=== Decline ===
Despite nineteenth century efforts to connect the village to the expanding railway network the North Staffordshire Railway received an act of parliament to build a branch line from Stowe-by-Chartley which was never taken advantage of. Abbots Bromley remained comparatively isolated and in decline, losing its market, fairs and economic status.

=== 20th century ===
By the 1950s the village faced economic decay and an ageing population. It was also comparatively late in receiving mains electricity and gas services. More recently it has become a dormitory settlement for surrounding urban areas such as the West Midlands conurbation and Derby. There has been some new development as well as the restoration of historic buildings, with a Millennium Hall perhaps the most noted recent example.

== Parish Council ==
Nine Parish Councillors, elected every four years represent the community. Every year the Council elects a chair (currently Cllr Richard Love) and vice chair. The Parish Council is supported by the Parish Clerk. Meetings are usually held in the village hall at 19:00 on the last Wednesday of every month (except August and December due to holidays). All meetings are open to the public. One Parish surgery is also held every other month on a Saturday morning in the Church House to enable Parishioners to bring any local issues to the attention of a Councillor so that it can be reported to the full Parish Council meeting. Following the election of new Parish Councillors in May 2015 the council began the process of developing a Neighbourhood Plan, administered through a sub-group of the Parish Council.

=== Other local representation ===
Abbots Bromley is part of the Bagots and Needwood Ward on East Staffordshire Borough Council and is currently represented by three Conservative Borough Councillors. The former leader of the County Council, Conservative Councillor Phillip Atkins represents the Parish as it forms part of the Uttoxeter Rural Ward on Staffordshire County Council. The village is part of the parliamentary constituency of Lichfield and is currently represented by Labour MP Dave Robertson.

== Schools ==
The village is home to The Richard Clarke First School, run by the Uttoxeter Learning Trust for pupils aged 4–9. The school was founded in 1606 via a bequest made by Richard Clarke a local man who achieved success in London in the trade of a dyer. The school was originally known as &#x27;Clarke&#x27;s Grammar School&#x27;. The current school is rated as good by OFSTED with outstanding features. 
The village is part of the three tier school system, now quite rare in England. From age 9-13 pupils go to Oldfields Hall Middle School in Uttoxeter and then from age 13-16 (or 18 if students opt to stay on in the sixth form) to Thomas Alleyne&#x27;s High School also in Uttoxeter.

The village was also the home of one of the original Woodard Schools, and the first in the Woodard Group for girls Abbots Bromley School (formerly known as Abbots Bromley School for Girls and before that the School of S. Mary and S. Anne). In 2015 the school opened a new International College on the former St Mary&#x27;s site. The school closed in July 2019 and the site has been sold. The future of the site since the sale is as yet unclear.

== Historic buildings ==
The village has a large number of listed buildings, and its historic core has conservation area status, reflecting its pre-industrial townscape. Of these, the half timbered Church House, The Goats Head Inn, which is claimed to be the original town hall, and the Schoolhouse (Richard Clarke&#x27;s 1606 Grammar School) are some of the most noteworthy. The Market Cross (Buttercross) has been designated a scheduled Ancient Monument.

It begins in the morning on the village green and passes to Blithfield Hall, returning to the village in the early afternoon with the dancers then making their way around the pubs and houses, eventually finishing with a service of Compline at the church.

<doc id="315445" wikidata="Q4664265" url="?curid=315445" title="Abbots Bromley Horn Dance">
<text>The Abbots Bromley Horn Dance is a folk dance which takes place each September in the village of Abbots Bromley in Staffordshire, England. It is performed by ten dancers, accompanied by a musician playing an accordion and a youth with a triangle. Six of the dancers carry reindeer horns; the remaining four take the roles of a hobby horse, Maid Marian, a fool, and a youth with a bow and arrow. On Wakes Monday the performers dance around the parish all day, beginning early in the morning at the parish church where the horns are stored.

The origin of the dance is unknown. The earliest written record of a hobby-horse performance at Abbots Bromley dates to 1532 and the first mention of the reindeer horns is from 1686. Radiocarbon dating has shown that at least one of the horns dates to the eleventh century, though it is unknown how or when they came to Staffordshire or became associated with the dance. Many explanations of the meaning of the dance have been proposed, and it is commonly interpreted as a pagan ritual, but there is no evidence for any of them.

==History==

The earliest written mention of the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance is in Robert Plot&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Staffordshire&quot;, published in 1686. According to an annotation by Sir Simon Degge in his copy of Plot&#x27;s book, he had seen the dance being performed before the English Civil War (1642–1651). An earlier mention of the hobby horse at Abbots Bromley from 1532 describes it as an ancient custom, but does not mention the horns. In 1976, one of the reindeer horns was radiocarbon dated to 1065 ± 80 years. It is unknown when the horns were brought to Abbots Bromley and when they began to be used in the dance. Though many sources claim that the dance was first performed at the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day fair in 1226, there is no evidence for this supposition.

Many explanations for the origin of the dance have been proposed, though there is no concrete evidence for any of them. It has often been interpreted as the remnant of a pagan ritual. Violet Alford believed that the dance was originally a winter solstice fertility rite. Alternatively it has been suggested that it originally was connected to hunting, either as a ritual to encourage or celebrate a successful hunt, or to celebrate the villagers&#x27; hunting rights. Parallels have been drawn to the prehistoric deer skull headdresses from Star Carr in Yorkshire, or the &quot;Sorcerer&quot; cave-painting from Trois-Frères in southern France, as well as references in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; to a deer-hunter being awarded the deer&#x27;s &quot;leather skin and horns to wear&quot;, and in Anthony Munday&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Robert Earl of Huntingdon&quot; to Friar Tuck &quot;carrying a stag&#x27;s head dauncing&quot;, both from the end of the sixteenth century.

In the seventeenth century, the dance was performed in the Christmas period – according to Robert Plot, &quot;on New Year, and Twelfth-day&quot; – but it now takes place on the Monday following the first Sunday after September 4. Plot reports that the dancers collected money for church repairs and to support the parish poor. In the Tudor period, the use of hobby horses to raise money for the parish at Christmastime seems to have been widespread in the north Midlands. Along with Abbots Bromley, it is attested at Stafford and at Culworth in Northamptonshire; a hobby-horse performance at Holme Pierrepoint in Nottinghamshire also probably took place in the winter.

The horn dance apparently stopped being performed around the time of the English Civil War, before being re-established in the eighteenth century; this is probably when the date of the dance changed from Christmas to September time. According to local tradition, the dance has been led by the same family since the eighteenth century.

==Event==

===Schedule===
The Horn Dance takes place on Wakes Monday, the day following the first Sunday after 4 September. It previously took place at the beginning of January, on New Year and Twelfth Night.

The dance starts at 8 a.m. at St Nicholas&#x27;s Church in Abbots Bromley and travels around the parish before returning to the village at the end of the day. The first dance is outside the vicarage; the dancers subsequently perform in the marketplace and various houses and farms around the parish. About midday they dance at Blithfield Hall and have lunch there. Afterwards, the dancers return to the village, with the final dance around 8 p.m. In the Victorian period, the dancers went out for several days, visiting nearby towns and villages such as Colton and Rugeley.

===Dancers===

Twelve people perform in the dance: six dancers carrying reindeer horns, a fool, Maid Marian (played by a man wearing women&#x27;s clothes), a hobby horse, a child with a bow and arrow, a musician, and a child with a triangle. The triangle player is a relatively recent addition to the side, only having been introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century. Of these, the two musicians do not dance; their role is only to accompany the dancers. The dancers use the hobby horse&#x27;s jaw and the bow and arrow as percussion instruments to keep time with the music. The Maid Marian carries a ladle used to collect money; the fool has a bladder on a stick. According to Robert Plot&#x27;s account, in his day the dancer with the hobby horse also held the bow and arrow; Violet Alford doubts that it was possible for one person to do both. Plot does not mention either the fool or the Maid Marian; Ronald Hutton suggests that the Maid Marian was a nineteenth-century addition to the dance.

===Costume===
Until the 1880s, dancers wore their ordinary clothes decorated with ribbons. At this time, the vicar&#x27;s wife designed costumes for the dancers in a mock-medieval style, originally made from old curtains and perhaps inspired by the sixteenth-century painted Betley window; these costumes were replaced in 1904 and again in 1951. The dancers wear either green or red jackets, with green breeches with an oak leaf pattern. The 1904 version of the costume introduced jester&#x27;s motley for the fool. The hobby horse is of the tourney style, in which a horse&#x27;s head and tail are fixed to the performer&#x27;s body by a frame, which is then covered by a cloth, giving the appearance of a person riding a horse.

===Antlers===

The antlers used in the dance are from reindeer, and date to the 11th century. As there were no reindeer in Britain at this point, they must have been imported, most likely from Scandinavia. The largest measures across and weighs ; the smallest measures across and the lightest weighs . Three of the sets of antlers are painted white and three are painted brown; historically the brown antlers have instead been painted blue and red at different times. In the seventeenth century they had the coats of arms of important local families painted on them, but these are no longer visible. The antlers are set into wooden heads, thought to date from the sixteenth century, which are mounted on wooden poles. The heads are painted brown with features drawn on in red and black.

The eighteenth-century Staffordshire antiquarian Richard Wilkes claimed that the Abbots Bromley horns were brought by William Paget, the ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. However, Paget&#x27;s return from Turkey postdates the accounts of Plot and Degge which mention the horns.

Wilkes also reports that the antlers were stored in Abbots Bromley&#x27;s town hall. In 1820 Thomas Harwood was the first to report that they were stored in the church, first in the church tower and subsequently in the Hurst Chapel.

According to tradition, the horns must not leave the parish. A different set of horns, acquired in the 1950s, is used for performances outside Abbots Bromley.

===Dance===

In 1911, Cecil Sharp described the dance as being made up of two main figures. In the first, the dancers process around in a circle before turning and circling back. In the second, the dancers face off in two rows, dancing together and apart before crossing over, turning around, and repeating the process to return to their original place. It is performed without any special footwork: Alford describes the dance as a &quot;steady rhythmical plod&quot;.

There is no specific tune associated with the dance. In 1898, the vicar of Abbots Bromley recalled that there had previously been a special tune for the dance but that it had been lost. In 1912, Sharp published a tune sent to him by a J. Buckley which Buckley said he had collected in the 1850s from a fiddler from Abbots Bromley. According to Andrew Bullen, &quot;this is the tune most often associated with the horn dance and it is probably the oldest&quot;; however, there is some dispute as to whether the tune did in fact accompany the dance. 

Other tunes associated with the dance have been collected from William Adey, a dancer who in 1924 recalled a tune which he remembered being used in the 1870s and 1880s, and Edie Sammons, whose brother played for the dance. When Sharp collected the dance, &quot;any country-dance air&quot; was used; more recently modern tunes are also played.

==In culture==
Shortly after Sharp recorded the Abbots Bromley horn dance in &quot;Sword Dances of Northern England&quot;, versions of it began to be performed outside of the village by members of the English Folk Dance Society (now the English Folk Dance and Song Society). Since 1947, a version of the dance has been performed by Thaxted Morris Men at the Thaxted meetings of the Morris Ring. In 1951 they also performed the dance to celebrate the Festival of Britain. Ivon Hitchens&#x27; &quot;Mural&quot;, in the Kennedy Hall of Cecil Sharp House, the headquarters of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, depicts English folk-dances and traditions. The horn dancers shown on the right of the mural are probably based on those at Abbots Bromley. A series of pencil drawings by Dave Pearson, &quot;In the Seven Woods&quot;, also depict the Abbots Bromley dance.

In 2019, Royal Mail issued a set of stamps depicting unusual British customs and festivals which included the Abbots Bromley horn dance. The dance was one of three traditional dances which inspired Hanna Tuulikki&#x27;s &quot;Deer Dancer&quot;. The dance has been featured in exhibitions including &quot;Mummers, Maypoles, and Milkmaids: A Journey Through the English Ritual Year&quot; at the Horniman Museum in 2012, and &quot;Making Michief: Folk Costume in Britain&quot; at Compton Verney in 2023.

<text>Godmanchester ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Huntingdonshire district of Cambridgeshire, England. It is separated from Huntingdon, to the north, by the valley of the River Great Ouse. Being on the Roman road network, the town has a long history. It has a waterside location, surrounded by open countryside of high value for its biodiversity but it remains highly accessible, with a railway line to London, the A1 road and M11/A14 which run nearby.

==Etymology==
The name ‘Godmanchester’ is first attested as &quot;Godmundcestre&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and subsequently variously appears as &quot;Gutmuncetre, Gudmencestre, Gudmundcestria, Gum(m)uncestre, Gumencestre, Guncestre, Gumcestria, Gumecestre, Gommecestre, Gomecestria, Gummecestre, Gurmund(es)cestre, Gormecestre, Gormancestre, Gomecestre, Gunnecestre, Gurmecestre, Godmechestre, Gurminchestre, Gumchestre, Gurmencestre, Gumcestre, Gumestre, Godmonchestre, Gumecestur&quot; and &quot;Gumycestre&quot;.

The first part of the name comes from an Anglo-Saxon personal name, either Guðmund or Godmund. Godmund is also the basis of the place-names Goodmanham (East Riding of Yorkshire) and Gumley (Leicestershire). Later forms of these names occur with a spelling Guth- or Gut-. The second part of the name refers to the Roman fort or ‘chester’ (from the Latin ‘castrum’) south of the River Ouse, identified with the Durovigutum mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary.

There is no etymological or historical connection between the town and the Danish King Guðrum of East Anglia (c.835–890) or with the Goths, a Germanic people of central and eastern Europe.

A minority of visitors, former residents and residents continue to pronounce the place as &quot;Gumster&quot; (), though this has long-since been superseded by &quot;Godmunchester&quot;, with stress on the first syllable.

==History==
The town is on the site of the Roman town of &quot;Durovigutum&quot;. There is archaeological evidence of Celtic and earlier habitation prior to the establishment of a key Roman town and a mansio (inn), so the area has probably been continuously occupied for more than 2,000 years. In contrast to Huntingdon, archaeological finds have been extensive in the centre of Godmanchester.
The town has two conservation areas showing architecture from the last 400 years. Over 100 privately occupied Listed buildings, including many timber-framed Tudor houses may be seen. The largest being Tudor Farm, dating from 1600 and restored in 1995.

=== Pre-Roman ===
The remains of a neolithic temple of considerable importance, carbon dated to 3685–3365 cal BCE and aligned to the Beltane sunrise, were documented on the edge of Godmanchester. The site between the town and the village of Hemingford Abbots has been exposed to gravel extraction. The location is likely to have been originally settled due to the gravel beds providing a ford across the River Great Ouse.

=== Post-Roman ===
The Roman settlement was at a crossroads of: Ermine Street, (from London to York); the Via Devana (from Colchester through Cambridge to Chester); and a military road from Sandy, Bedfordshire. Archeological discoveries include a basilica, a bathhouse, temple, a &quot;Mansio&quot; which is one of the largest in the UK, other villas, farmsteads and a hoard of Jewelry, suggesting a population of up to 3000 people. The end of the third century saw a catastrophic contraction of the Roman town, probably following an attack by Saxon raiders

The town&#x27;s prosperity since the Romans has been closely tied to its strategic position on the old Roman Road from London to York. It is suggested that, in the Middle Ages, the Danes allowed development of an inland port by digging the Mill Lade.

The place was listed as &quot;Godmundcestre&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the Hundred of Leightonstone in Huntingdonshire. The survey records that there were 26 ploughlands, with capacity for a further 31 and, in addition to the arable land, there were of meadows, of woodland and three water mills, a church and a priest.

Godmanchester was first recognised with a town charter by King John in 1212, although it had been a market town and royal manor for some years. King James I granted a second Royal Charter in 1604.

Farm Hall, on West Street, was used as a bugged detention centre for German nuclear scientists as part of Operation Epsilon, from July 1945 to January 1946. The plot was successfully produced as a West End play in 2023

==Government==

Godmanchester was a municipal borough based at Godmanchester Town Hall in the county of Huntingdonshire until 1961. It was then part of the borough of Huntingdon and Godmanchester until 1974. At county level, the town was in Huntingdonshire until 1965, when it became part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. In 1974, the former, relatively diminutive, county of Huntingdon and Peterborough was absorbed into the administrative county of Cambridgeshire.

The highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council, locally represented by two county councillors serving &quot;Godmanchester and Huntingdon East&quot; (electoral division).

The second tier of local government, the planning authority and council-tax collecting body, is Huntingdonshire District Council, a non-metropolitan district, locally represented by two councillors elected for an eponymous ward.

The third and lowest tier of local government is Godmanchester town council. The council comprises 17 councillors, including a mayor and a deputy mayor.

Godmanchester is represented within the parliamentary constituency of Huntingdon, in the House of Commons. Ben Obese-Jecty (Conservative) was elected as MP in 2024, replacing Jonathan Djanogly

==Demography==
===Population===
Since 1801, the population has been recorded every ten years by the UK census, the only exception being in 1941 due to the Second World War. In the 19th century, the population ranged from 1,573 (in 1801) to 2,438 (recorded in 1861).

The fastest growth, an 81% increase in population, was between 1981 and 1991

Population figures since 1911 are:

In 2021, the parish covered an area of and so the population density for Godmanchester in 2021 was 10,300 persons per square mile (3,980 per square kilometre).

By 2016, Godmanchester had a population of about 6800 in 3,100 homes; it is expected that this will further increase to at least 4050 homes and 8600 residents by 2036.

==Culture and community==
The town has a waterside location surrounded by open countryside of high value for its biodiversity, agricultural land value, scenic beauty and landscape quality.

There are several bridges across the Great Ouse to Huntingdon. The Old Bridge, Huntingdon, a historic, medieval bridge, was the only road until 1975. In that year the original bypass route which is now used as a local road was built. Pedestrian traffic across the river is principally served by three additional footbridges.

England&#x27;s largest meadow Portholme may be accessed from Godmanchester or Huntingdon, but lies within the Parish of Brampton. It remains an important flood plain, but has served as an equestrian racecourse and centre for early aviation.

To the North and East of the town are West and Eastside Common (SSSI), and Godmanchester Nature Reserve. These commons are intersected by The Ouse Valley Way and Pathfinder Way long-distance footpaths, and the route of a disused railway which connected the demolished Godmanchester Station and St Ives.

South of the town centre are the headquarters and a large operational shelter of veterinary/rescue charity Wood Green Animal Shelters.

A number of small businesses, plus DHL and Coop warehouses are situated on the southern edge of the town, on Chord Business park, Roman Way Industrial Estate and Cardinal Business Park.

Original historical documents relating to Godmanchester, including the original church parish registers, local government records, maps, photographs and the surviving borough charters, are held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office, Huntingdon.

==Landmarks==
===Church of St Mary the Virgin===

The Church of St Mary the Virgin is a Church of England parish church and is a Grade I listed building, with its earliest phase dating to the 13th century. Most of the structure is of 13th- to 15th-century date but the tower was built in 1623. The stalls with misericords date from the late 15th century.

In October 2003 BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; was hosted by St Mary&#x27;s and featured the new hymn tune &quot;Godmanchester&quot;, written by the then vicar, Peter Moger.

===Chinese Bridge===

One of the town&#x27;s largest public works of art and of landscaping is its Chinese Bridge, which connects to a water meadow. Local legend has it that the bridge was built without the use of nails or other fixings. The bridge was removed by crane on 9 February 2010. A new replica was built off-site in two parts and was installed on 15–16 February 2010. Today the Chinese Bridge does feature nails. The claims are believed to be false; a bridge in Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, had the same urban myth. Expert commentators write that the original nails had corroded away, masking their presence.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Godmanchester is twinned with:
*Wertheim am Main, Germany

Facilitated by Huntingdon and Godmanchester Twinning Association

==Sport and leisure==
The non-League football club Godmanchester Rovers F.C. play at Bearscroft Lane, whose teams play in various regional divisions.

==Transport==
In 2019 the six lane A14 was opened allowing heavy traffic to pass unhindered over the long Great Ouse Viaduct, south of the town. The arterial road connects the West Midlands to the Haven ports of Ipswich, Harwich and Felixstowe and via the M11 to London. Since opening in 2020 the A1307 provides a resilient route for light vehicles, north across the river into Huntingdon, or south to St. Ives and Cambridge. (Historically this route has been repeatedly renamed: most recent first, A1307, A14, A604, A132, Via Devana).

The A1198 road, Ermine Street links traffic to the A14 or to Royston, and is used for shorter journeys south avoiding the A1.

Huntingdon railway station, a semi-major stop on the East Coast Main Line is less than from the town centre by car.

The town of Huntingdon and railway station may also be accessed on foot via the expansive meadow or by National Cycle Network route 51.

Local buses from Godmanchester are provided by Whippet (bus company) on routes 66 (to Huntingdon and St Neots) and X2/X3 (to Huntingdon or Papworth and Cambridge).

<text>The white-winged tern, or white-winged black tern (Chlidonias leucopterus or &quot;Chlidonias leucoptera&quot;), is a species of tern in the family Laridae. It is a small species generally found in or near bodies of fresh water across much of the world, including Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;khelidonios&quot;, &quot;swallow-like&quot;, from &quot;khelidon&quot;, &quot;swallow&quot;.

The name &#x27;white-winged tern&#x27; is the standard in most English-speaking countries; in the United Kingdom, this name is also the one used by the formal ornithological recording authorities, but the older alternative &#x27;white-winged black tern&#x27; is still frequent in popular use.

== Description ==
Adult birds in summer have short red legs and a short black bill (small and stubby, measuring 22–25 mm from the feathers, decidedly shorter than the head), a black neck (often with a pale gray back) and belly, very dark grey back, with a white rump and light grey (almost white) tail, which often looks &#x27;square&#x27; in juveniles. The face is tinged yellowish. The wings, as the name implies, are mainly white. The inner wing is grayish with brown-tipped coverts. In non-breeding plumage, most of the black is replaced by white or pale grey, though a few blackish feathers may be retained, admixed with white underparts. A good deal of black shows in the underwing-coverts. The head is black, with a white forehead. The crown is blackish-brown, flecked with white, and the hindcrown is blackish with a certain amount of white flecking. These white markings are pronounced in the winter adult. There is a dark triangular patch forward of the eye. The collar is fairly broad and white. In juveniles and moulting adults, the rump is pale gray, becoming grey in both phases late in the year. The clear white collar and rump isolate the mantle as a dark brown &#x27;saddle&#x27;. The mantle feathers have narrow paler brown tips, as have the tertials and scapulars.

== Hybridisation with black tern ==

Hybridisation between this species and black tern has been recorded from Sweden and the Netherlands. Two juvenile birds at Chew Valley Lake, England, in September 1978 and September 1981, were also believed to be hybrids; they showed mixed characters of the two species, specifically a combination of a dark mantle (a feature of white-winged black) with dark patches on the breast-side (a feature of black tern, not shown by white-winged black).

== Distribution and habitat ==
Their breeding habitat is freshwater marshes across from southeast Europe to Central Asia and the Russian Far East. They usually nest either on floating vegetation in a marsh or on the ground very close to water, laying 2–4 eggs in a nest built of small reed stems and other vegetation. In winter, they migrate to Africa, southern Asia and Australia. It is a scarce vagrant in North America, mainly on the Atlantic coast, but a few records on the Pacific coast and inland in the Great Lakes area. The species has also been recorded as a vagrant in South America, including records in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia.

== Behaviour ==
Like the other &quot;marsh&quot; terns (&quot;Chlidonias&quot;), and unlike the &quot;white&quot; (&quot;Sterna&quot;) terns, these birds do not dive for fish, but fly slowly over the water to surface-pick items and catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects and small fish. In flight, the wing-beats are shallow and leisurely.

The white-winged tern is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="315449" wikidata="Q790839" url="?curid=315449" title="Aviation Traders Carvair">
<text>The Aviation Traders ATL-98 Carvair is a retired large transport aircraft powered by four radial engines. It was a Douglas DC-4-based air ferry conversion developed by Freddie Laker&#x27;s Aviation Traders (Engineering) Limited (ATL), with a capacity generally of 22 passengers in a rear cabin, and five cars loaded in at the front.

==Design and development==
Freddie Laker&#x27;s idea to convert surplus examples of the Douglas DC-4 and its military counterpart the C-54 Skymaster to carry cars was a relatively inexpensive solution to develop a successor to the rapidly aging and increasingly inadequate Bristol 170 Freighter, the car ferry airlines&#x27; mainstay since the late 1940s.

The Bristol Freighter&#x27;s main drawback was its limited car payload: even the &quot;long-nosed&quot; Mark 32 was able to accommodate only three cars, in addition to 20 passengers. This made carrying cars by air a very risky business: if a booked car did not arrive for the flight, the one-third cut in payload made the flight unprofitable. This was made worse by the increasing average length of British cars during the 1950s: the average UK car in 1959 was longer than in 1950. The extreme seasonality of the car ferry business furthermore resulted in poor aircraft utilization outside peak periods. Moreover, repeated takeoffs and landings on short cross-Channel flights, in turbulent air at lower altitudes with tight turnarounds of as little as 20 minutes, made the aircraft prone to structural fatigue problems, necessitating rigorous and costly modification programmes, further increasing the type&#x27;s operating costs on low-yield routes.

When the major airlines replaced their obsolete piston airliners with new Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 jets on their prestige long-haul routes, the unit price of second-hand DC-4s dropped to as little as £50,000 (equivalent to £ million today). The conversion of each of these airframes into car-passenger carriers cost about £80,000 (£ million today). This was easily affordable by smaller airlines, such as the car ferry companies. Freddie Laker&#x27;s cardboard model of a converted DC-4 featuring a door in the nose and a flight deck raised &quot;above&quot; the fuselage had shown that its payload was superior to the Bristol Freighter/Superfreighter. The aircraft conversion was designed to accommodate five average-sized British cars plus 25 passengers in the DC-4&#x27;s longer and wider fuselage. British Air Ferries (BAF), for example, operated its Carvairs in a flexible configuration, either accommodating five cars and 22 passengers or two-three cars and 55 passengers, changeable from one configuration to the other in about 40 minutes. In addition, the DC-4&#x27;s lack of pressurisation was suitable for low-altitude cross-Channel flights, making the proposed structural conversion straightforward. The result was a new aircraft christened &quot;Carvair&quot; (derived from &quot;car-via-air&quot;).

Initially, it was thought that second-hand, pressurised Douglas DC-6 and Douglas DC-7 airframes could be converted into larger, &quot;second generation&quot; Carvairs within 15 years of the original DC-4-based Carvair&#x27;s entry into service.

The conversion of the original DC-4 entailed replacing the forward fuselage with one longer, with a flight deck raised into a bulbous &quot;hump&quot; like the later Boeing 747 jet, to allow a sideways-hinged nose door. It also required more powerful wheel brakes and an enlarged tail, often thought to be a Douglas DC-7 unit, but actually a completely new design. The engines, four Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2000 Twin Wasps, were unchanged.

The prototype conversion first flew on 21 June 1961. Twenty-one Carvairs were produced in the UK, with production of aircraft 1, 11 and 21 at Southend Airport and the others at Stansted Airport. The final three aircraft were delivered to Australia&#x27;s Ansett-ANA, which supplied its own DC-4s to ATL for conversion, unlike the previous 18 aircraft that were purchased by ATL and either sold on or transferred to associate company British United Air Ferries (BUAF). One of the two aircraft still flying in June 2007 was an ex-Ansett airframe. A second Ansett aircraft was abandoned at Phnom Penh in 1975. The first flight of the last conversion, number 21, for Ansett, was on 12 July 1968.

Basic price for a Carvair newly converted from a C-54 airframe (two of the three Ansett airframes supplied were of the DC-4 variant) in 1960 was £150,000, equivalent to £ million today.

==Operational history==
The Carvair was used by Aer Lingus, BUA/BUAF and BAF among others, and was used in Congo-Kinshasa during 1962–1963, under contract to the United Nations. Aircraft for Aer Lingus were quickly convertible between 55 seats, and 22 seats with five cars. Some aircraft were pure freighters with only nine seats. One aircraft had 55 high-density seats and room for three cars. BAF was the last operator in Europe of the aircraft, keeping them flying into the 1970s.

==Surviving aircraft==
* 9J-PAA (the 21st and final Carvair built) is in South Africa with Phoebus Apollo Aviation. Formerly registered in Zambia, the aircraft is currently on display at Rand Airport, where it sits near other uncommon aircraft such as the Boeing 747SP. Although removed from the Zambian register, the owner planned to return it to the skies for air shows.
* N89FA &quot;Miss 1944&quot; (the 9th Carvair) is based in Gainesville, Texas at KGLE Gainesville Municipal Airport. The aircraft is still complete as of April 2024, and has been seen receiving periodic maintenance, but there is no specific evidence that she has flown in recent years. In 2005 this aircraft appeared at the World Free Fall Convention, Rantoul, Illinois, where it took over 100 skydivers into the air in one flight.

==Specifications==
==Notable appearances in media==

British United Carvairs made an appearance in the 1964 James Bond movie &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as Auric Goldfinger and bodyguard Oddjob boarded bound for Switzerland while Goldfinger&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Phantom was being loaded through the Carvair&#x27;s nose. In the 1967 TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; in the episode &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot;, the plane is seen being loaded through the nose, then taking off and landing again. A Carvair serves as Charlie Marshall&#x27;s plane in the John Le Carre novel &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;.

<text>The Niagara Peninsula is an area of land lying between the southwestern shore of Lake Ontario and the northeastern shore of Lake Erie, in Ontario, Canada. Technically an isthmus rather than a peninsula, it stretches from the Niagara River in the east to Hamilton, Ontario, in the west. The peninsula is located in the Golden Horseshoe region of Southern Ontario, and has a population of roughly 1,000,000 residents. The region directly across the Niagara River and Lake Erie in New York State is known as the Niagara Frontier.

==Government==
The greater part of the peninsula is incorporated as the Regional Municipality of Niagara. Cities in the region include St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Thorold, Port Colborne and Welland. Towns include Niagara-on-the-Lake, Lincoln, Pelham, Grimsby and Fort Erie, as well as the townships Wainfleet and West Lincoln. The remainder of the peninsula encompasses parts of the City of Hamilton and Haldimand County.

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by a First Nations people called the &quot;Neutrals&quot;, so named for their practice of trading goods such as flint arrowhead blanks with both of the feuding regional powers, the Wyandot and Iroquois. The Neutrals were wiped out by the Iroquois c. 1650 as the latter sought to expand their fur-trapping territory as part of the Beaver Wars. From this point until the arrival of United Empire Loyalists following the American War of Independence, the region was only sporadically inhabited, as the Iroquois did not establish permanent settlements in the area.

The Niagara Peninsula then became one of the first areas settled in Upper Canada by British Loyalists in the late 18th century. The capital of the new colony was established with the founding of Niagara-on-the-Lake, then called Newark. Many English and Irish immigrants settled in the peninsula, but by the 1800s, Italian and German immigrants heavily populated the peninsula and were the chief sources of immigrants followed by French, Polish, and other Central Europeans .

Following the agricultural period of European settlement, the Niagara area became an important industrial centre, with water-powered mills joined later by hydro-electric power generation in Niagara Falls and electricity-intensive industry in both Niagara Falls and St. Catharines. While agriculture – especially fruit farming along the shore of Lake Ontario – remains important to this day, it was joined in the 19th century by industrial developments. A succession of canals were built to connect the markets and mineral resources of the upper Great Lakes with the St. Lawrence Seaway (See also Welland Canal). General Motors built a considerable presence in St. Catharines with auto plants and a foundry, and a number of auto-parts manufacturers followed. Dry docks were also built at Port Weller on Lake Ontario.

==21st century==

Heavy industry has been diminishing for the past decade or more primarily due to the slow-down of the North American automotive manufacturers. Thousands of jobs have been lost at long-time area employers such as General Motors, Thompson Products, Deere &amp; Company, Dana Canada Corp, Port Weller Drydocks, Domtar Papers, and Gallagher Thorold Paper. Because of this, local municipalities have been forced to look at new and diversified opportunities to prevent an exodus of well trained staff.

==Visiting==

Hospitality and tourism has attracted numerous visitors to the area for more than 150 years primarily thanks to Niagara Falls. New development beginning during the mid-1990s has spun off an upscale hospitality boom throughout the whole Niagara Peninsula.

Today, more than 10 million guests visit the peninsula annually to see the beauty of the Falls and the Niagara Parks. Ecotourism has become more popular with more people finding and exploring out of the way places such as the Niagara Escarpment, named a world Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1990.

=== Niagara Peninsula wineries ===
Another area of major tourism growth in the past thirty years has been the expansion of the grape and wine industry. The Niagara Peninsula is one of four recognized viticultural areas by the VQA in the Ontario wine industry. The many European-style wineries and vineyards have played a major role in attracting visitors seeking a unique cultural experience. Most of the local wineries offer full tours of their facilities with a few offering onsite dining featuring unique Canadian cuisine paired with their own VQA vintages. It is common for many of these wineries&#x27; world-class chefs to use fresh ingredients that are grown or acquired from local farms in season. Some wineries also feature live music and theatrical performances in the vineyard during the summer months. Visitors come during the coldest months of the year (usually December to February) to watch some varieties of grapes being harvested and pressed outdoors in the vineyard as part of the process of creating the sweetest, and among the most expensive, wine on earth – ice wine. A few Niagara Peninsula wineries have won the most prestigious international awards for their ice wine products, many of which are only available from the vintner.

There is an official Wine Routes Guide for those that wish to self-drive while transportation companies offering wine tours operate out of major hotel and bed and breakfast establishments in Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake and Toronto. (Driving from downtown Toronto to the Niagara wine region is about two hours.)

=== Niagara-on-the-Lake ===

Another major attraction for the well travelled looking for cultural activities is the famous Shaw Festival Theater (named for playwright George Bernard Shaw) located in the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. A resident repertory company of actors uses three theatres during a six-month season. Niagara-on-the-Lake is also the location of Fort George, a British-built and -occupied fort during the War of 1812. It was rebuilt for the public during the 1960s and is open during the summer months. Other key historical locations nearby include: Brock&#x27;s Monument, the Laura Secord Monument and the battlefield sites of Battle of Queenston Heights, Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane and Battle of Chippawa.

==Living==

The region&#x27;s moderate year-round climate, in addition to its close proximity to the United States for easy road and air access to the southern U.S., makes it a popular retirement destination. In fact, the Niagara Peninsula has both the highest density and growth rate of seniors for any region within Ontario. The highest percentage of seniors to the total population is located within the city of Port Colborne.

During the early 1990s a major telecommunications highway between metropolitan Toronto and the U.S. was upgraded to become one of North America&#x27;s fastest fiber backbones. It passes through the heart of the Niagara Peninsula and enters the U.S. at Buffalo, New York. This gave Niagara the advantage of having direct access to the backbone and attracting many new professional call centers.

Compared with the cities of Toronto, Hamilton and most Ontario municipalities with populations similar in size to the whole of the Niagara Peninsula, the average cost of living is very reasonable. The cost of housing, both owned and rented, is lower. The three major cities, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland are mostly urban with most needed services available locally. The remainder of the peninsula, especially to the far west and south, is either partially urban or almost entirely rural.

Centres of higher education are Brock University and Niagara College, both offering undergraduate and post-graduate studies in many disciplines.

==Transportation==

The major roadway bisecting the peninsula is the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW). This freeway connects Toronto and Buffalo, New York, in the United States. It is one of the major thoroughfares for the North American trucking industry and is responsible for supporting the carriage of nearly one third of all goods imported and exported. The second major roadway is Highway 406 which begins at the QEW in west St. Catharines and ends approximately 30 km south in the city of Welland. Another shorter freeway is Highway 405, named the General Isaac Brock Parkway in 2006. It begins at the QEW in Niagara-on-the-Lake, just east of St. Catharines, and ends about 9 km away at Queenston, Ontario, where it connects to an international bridge that crosses into the United States at Lewiston, New York. This is also a major travel zone for the Canada/US trucking industry.

All cities and some towns in the peninsula have taxi services while St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland all have a local transit commission. There is also one major airbus company that services Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo airports exclusively. Most cities and some towns also have very limited inter-city bus services operated mostly by Greyhound and Coach Canada. A specialized inter-city regional bus service, owned and operated by the Regional government, began operation in late 2006 but is restricted to those requiring transport to medical appointments throughout the region and have no other means of transportation. (Other restrictions apply.) The region hopes to have a fully integrated region-level transit system by the end of the decade.

Niagara Falls, St. Catharines and Grimsby are all connected to the CN railway line. Via Rail offers limited daily commuter and weekend service between these three peninsula municipalities and Toronto and many points between. Via Rail and Amtrak also offer daily southbound service from Toronto to New York City with stops at the same stations.

==Maritime infrastructure==
The Niagara Region also possesses significant maritime shipping infrastructure. The region is home to Port Weller, Port Colborne, the Welland Canal, and the largest Canadian Great Lakes port, in Hamilton.

<text>The ectoderm is one of the three primary germ layers formed in early embryonic development. It is the outermost layer, and is superficial to the mesoderm (the middle layer) and endoderm (the innermost layer). It emerges and originates from the outer layer of germ cells. The word ectoderm comes from the Greek &quot;ektos&quot; meaning &quot;outside&quot;, and &quot;derma&quot; meaning &quot;skin&quot;.

Generally speaking, the ectoderm differentiates to form epithelial and neural tissues (spinal cord, nerves and brain). This includes the skin, linings of the mouth, anus, nostrils, sweat glands, hair and nails, and tooth enamel. Other types of epithelium are derived from the endoderm.

In vertebrate embryos, the ectoderm can be divided into two parts: the dorsal surface ectoderm also known as the external ectoderm, and the neural plate, which invaginates to form the neural tube and neural crest. The surface ectoderm gives rise to most epithelial tissues, and the neural plate gives rise to most neural tissues. For this reason, the neural plate and neural crest are also referred to as the neuroectoderm.

== History ==

Heinz Christian Pander, a Baltic German–Russian biologist, has been credited for the discovery of the three germ layers that form during embryogenesis. Pander received his doctorate in zoology from the University of Würzburg in 1817. He began his studies in embryology using chicken eggs, which allowed for his discovery of the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Due to his findings, Pander is sometimes referred to as the &quot;founder of embryology&quot;.

Pander&#x27;s work of the early embryo was continued by a Prussian–Estonian biologist named Karl Ernst von Baer. Baer took Pander&#x27;s concept of the germ layers and through extensive research of many different types of species, he was able to extend this principle to all vertebrates. Baer also received credit for the discovery of the blastula. Baer published his findings, including his germ layer theory, in a textbook which translates to &quot;On the Development of Animals&quot; which he released in 1828.

== Differentiation ==

=== Initial appearance ===
The ectoderm can first be observed in amphibians and fish during the later stages of gastrulation. At the start of this process, the developing embryo has divided into many cells, forming a hollow ball called the blastula. The blastula is polar, and its two halves are called the animal hemisphere and vegetal hemisphere. It is the animal hemisphere will eventually become the ectoderm.

=== Early development ===

Like the other two germ layers – i.e., the mesoderm and endoderm – the ectoderm forms shortly after fertilization, after which rapid cell division begins. The position of the ectoderm relative to the other germ layers of the embryo is governed by &quot;selective affinity&quot;, meaning that the inner surface of the ectoderm has a strong (positive) affinity for the mesoderm, and a weak (negative) affinity for the endoderm layer. This selective affinity changes during different stages of development. The strength of the attraction between two surfaces of two germ layers is determined by the amount and type of cadherin molecules present on the cells&#x27; surface. For example, the expression of N-cadherin is crucial to maintaining separation of precursor neural cells from precursor epithelial cells. Likewise, while the surface ectoderm becomes the epidermis, the neuroectoderm is induced along the neural pathway by the notochord, which is typically positioned above it.

==== Gastrulation ====

During the process of gastrulation, bottle cells invaginate on the dorsal surface of the blastula to form the blastopore. The cells continue to extend inward and migrate along the inner wall of the blastula to form a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel. The once superficial cells of the animal pole are destined to become the cells of the middle germ layer called the mesoderm. Through the process of radial extension, cells of the animal pole that were once several layers thick divide to form a thin layer. At the same time, when this thin layer of dividing cells reaches the dorsal lip of the blastopore, another process occurs termed convergent extension. During convergent extension, cells that approach the lip intercalate mediolaterally, in such a way that cells are pulled over the lip and inside the embryo. These two processes allow for the prospective mesoderm cells to be placed between the ectoderm and the endoderm. Once convergent extension and radial intercalation are underway, the rest of the vegetal pole, which will become endoderm cells, is completely engulfed by the prospective ectoderm, as these top cells undergo epiboly, where the ectoderm cells divide in a way to form one layer. This creates a uniform embryo composed of the three germ layers in their respective positions.

=== Later development ===

Once the three germ layers have been established, cellular differentiation can occur. The first major process here is neurulation, wherein the ectoderm differentiates to form the neural tube, neural crest cells and the epidermis. Each of these three components will give rise to a particular complement of cells. The neural tube cells give rise to the central nervous system, neural crest cells give rise to the peripheral and enteric nervous system, melanocytes, and facial cartilage, and the epidermal region will give rise to the epidermis, hair, nails, sebaceous glands, olfactory and oral epithelium, and eyes.

==== Neurulation ====

Neurulation occurs in two parts, primary and secondary neurulation. Both processes position neural crest cells between a superficial epidermal layer and the deep neural tube. During primary neurulation, the notochord cells of the mesoderm signal the adjacent, superficial ectoderm cells to reposition themselves into a columnar pattern to form cells of the ectodermal neural plate. As the cells continue to elongate, a group of cells immediately above the notochord change their shape, forming a wedge in the ectodermal region. These special cells are called medial hinge cells (MHPs). As the ectoderm continues to elongate, the ectodermal cells of the neural plate fold inward. The inward folding of the ectoderm by virtue of mainly cell division continues until another group of cells forms within the neural plate. These cells are termed dorsolateral hinge cells (DLHPs), and, once formed, the inward folding of the ectoderm stops. The DLHP cells function in a similar fashion as MHP cells regarding their wedge like shape, however, the DLHP cells result in the ectoderm converging. This convergence is led by ectodermal cells above the DLHP cells known as the neural crest. The neural crest cells eventually pull the adjacent ectodermal cells together, which leaves neural crest cells between the prospective epidermis and hollow, neural tube.

==== Organogenesis ====
All of the organs that rise from the ectoderm such as the nervous system, teeth, hair and many exocrine glands, originate from two adjacent tissue layers: the epithelium and the mesenchyme. Several signals mediate the organogenesis of the ectoderm such as: FGF, TGFβ, Wnt, and regulators from the hedgehog family. The specific timing and manner that the ectodermal organs form is dependent on the invagination of the epithelial cells. FGF-9 is an important factor during the initiation of tooth germ development. The rate of epithelial invagination in significantly increased by action of FGF-9, which is only expressed in the epithelium, and not in the mesenchyme. FGF-10 helps to stimulate epithelial cell proliferation, in order make larger tooth germs. Mammalian teeth develop from ectoderm derived from the mesenchyme: oral ectoderm and neural crest. The epithelial components of the stem cells for continuously growing teeth form from tissue layers called the stellate reticulum and the suprabasal layer of the surface ectoderm.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Ectodermal dysplasia ===

Ectodermal dysplasia is a rare but severe condition where the tissue groups (specifically teeth, skin, hair, nails and sweat glands) derived from the ectoderm undergo abnormal development. This is a diffuse term, as there are over 170 subtypes of ectodermal dysplasia. It has been accepted that the disease is caused by a mutation or a combination of mutations in certain genes. Research of the disease is ongoing, as only a fraction of the mutations involved with an ectodermal dysplasia subtype have been identified.

Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is the most common subtype of the disease. Clinical cases of patients with this condition display a range of symptoms. The most relevant abnormality of HED is hypohidrosis, the inability to produce sufficient amounts of sweat, which is attributed to missing or dysfunctional sweat glands. This aspect represents a major handicap particularly in the summer, limits the patient&#x27;s ability to participate in sports as well as his working capacity, and can be especially dangerous in warm climates where affected individuals are at risk of life-threatening hyperthermia. Facial malformations are also related to HED, such as pointed or absent teeth, wrinkled skin around the eyes, a misshaped nose along with scarce and thin hair. Skin problems like eczema are also observed in a number of cases. Most patients carry variants of the X-chromosomal EDA gene. This disease typically affects males more severely because they have only one X chromosome, while in females the second, usually unaffected X chromosome may be sufficient to prevent most symptoms.

<text>Endoderm is the innermost of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo. The other two layers are the ectoderm (outside layer) and mesoderm (middle layer). Cells migrating inward along the archenteron form the inner layer of the gastrula, which develops into the endoderm.

The endoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the epithelial lining of multiple systems.

In plant biology, endoderm corresponds to the innermost part of the cortex (bark) in young shoots and young roots often consisting of a single cell layer. As the plant becomes older, more endoderm will lignify.

==Production==

The following chart shows the tissues produced by the endoderm.
The embryonic endoderm develops into the interior linings of two tubes in the body, the digestive and respiratory tube.
Liver and pancreas cells are believed to derive from a common precursor.

In humans, the endoderm can differentiate into distinguishable organs after 5 weeks of embryonic development.

<doc id="315471" wikidata="Q208591" url="?curid=315471" title="Anna Lindh">
<text>Ylva Anna Maria Lindh (19 June 1957 – 11 September 2003) was a Swedish Social Democratic politician and lawyer who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1998 until her death. She was also a Member of the Riksdag (member of parliament) for Södermanland County until her assassination. 

On 10 September 2003, four days before a referendum on replacing the Swedish krona with the euro as currency, Lindh was stabbed by Mijailo Mijailović at the NK department store in central Stockholm; she died the next morning at Karolinska University Hospital. She had been seen as a likely candidate to succeed Göran Persson as Social Democratic party leader. 

Her greatest commitment was to international cooperation and solidarity, as well as to environmental issues. She worked on these issues throughout her career, serving as Environment Minister from 1994 to 1998, and then as Foreign Minister for the last five years of her life.

==Early life and education==
Ylva Anna Maria Lindh was born to Staffan (1931–2017), an artist, and Nancy Lindh (1932–2005), a schoolteacher, in Enskede-Årsta, a suburb southeast of Stockholm. She grew up in Enköping. At age 12, she became involved in politics after joining a local branch of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, becoming its district chairman when she was 13. She took part in the Swedish movement against the Vietnam War.

Lindh studied at Uppsala University, graduating in 1982 as a Candidate of Law (&quot;jur. kand.&quot;). The same year, she won election as a Member of the Riksdag (MP) for Södermanland County. In 1984, she became the first woman chairperson of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League. Her six years as president were marked by a commitment to international affairs (including Nicaragua, Vietnam, South Africa and Palestine) and against the arms race which characterized the Cold War.

== Political career ==
Lindh served in the Riksdag from 1982 until 1985, and again from 1998 until her death in 2003. From 1991 to 1994, she was Commissioner of Culture and Environment and the Deputy Mayor of Stockholm. In 1994, after a Social Democratic victory in the election of that year, Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson appointed her to his cabinet as Minister for the Environment. One of Lindh&#x27;s legacies was her pioneering work towards European Union legislation on hazardous chemical substances. She also called for the establishment of a common EU strategy against acid rain.

After the 1998 election, Prime Minister Göran Persson appointed Lindh to succeed Lena Hjelm-Wallén as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the new government. Having made influential friends around the world as president of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, Lindh ardently supported international cooperation through the United Nations and in the European Union.

A high point in her career occurred during the Swedish presidency of the European Union in early 2001. Lindh served as chairman of the Council of the European Union, responsible for representing the official foreign policy position of the European Union. Travelling with European Union Foreign and Security Policy Spokesman Javier Solana in North Macedonia, during the Kosovo-Macedonian crisis, she negotiated an agreement which averted a civil war in the country.
Another talking point in her career was the violent repatriation of Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery from Sweden to Egypt, an operation carried out by the US military. According to a 2009 book published by journalist and friend of Lindh Eva Franchell, Göran Persson claimed the US administration would place a trade embargo on the European Union if Sweden did not let the Americans pick up Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery on Swedish soil. Persson publicly denied this claim following the book&#x27;s publication. Lindh had to choose between standing up for human rights and supporting trade relations with the US. She chose the latter and was later extensively criticised for her actions. On 24 May 2004, when the committee against torture at the United Nations&#x27; Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights found that the Government of Sweden had violated its obligations under the Convention against torture in the forced repatriation of Agiza, Lindh had already been murdered.

Lindh criticised the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying that: 

However, Lindh praised the fall of Saddam Hussein. She advocated greater respect for international law and human rights in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, criticising Ariel Sharon&#x27;s Israeli government, but also condemning Palestinian suicide bombings as &quot;&quot;. She argued strongly for an end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories; in an interview shortly before her death she said: 

During the final weeks of her life, she was involved in the pro-euro campaign, where she advocated for Sweden to become a member of the Eurozone. She led the yes campaign in the referendum. The referendum was held on 14 September 2003 (three days after her death). As a popular pro-euro politician, she was a spokesperson and chair for the yes campaign; her face was on billboards across Sweden the day she was murdered.

== Personal life ==
Lindh married Bo Holmberg in 1991. Holmberg was Governor of Södermanland (her home constituency for over 20 years). The couple had two sons, Filip and David.

==Assassination and aftermath==
On 10 September 2003, while shopping in the ladies&#x27; section of the Nordiska Kompaniet department store in central Stockholm for a televised debate later that night on the referendum about Sweden&#x27;s adoption of the euro, Lindh was stabbed in the chest, abdomen and arms. At the time, she was not protected by bodyguards from the Swedish Security Service; this proved controversial, given the similarity between Lindh&#x27;s murder and that of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986 (the first murder of a government member in modern Swedish history).

She was rushed to Karolinska University Hospital, where she underwent surgery and blood transfusions for over nine hours. Lindh reportedly experienced severe internal bleeding and liver damage; her condition remained grave, although she appeared to have improved immediately after the surgery. An hour later, however, complications necessitated additional surgery; at 05:29 on 11 September 2003, she was pronounced dead. After a private briefing of her relatives and the government (and contradicting news coverage that she was alive in &quot;grave&quot; but &quot;stable&quot; condition), the announcement of her death made headlines across the European Union.

===Criminal investigation===
The murderer escaped after the crime; according to eyewitness accounts, his actions appeared deliberate and systematic. A phone number was set up for anyone who might know anything about the crime, and a massive manhunt (centred on Stockholm) was launched in Sweden. After two days, a photo of a man believed to be the murderer, taken by a camera on a floor above the murder scene, was leaked by Swedish newspapers. Several items (pieces of clothing and a knife) believed to be connected with the murder were found outside the department store near a Stockholm metro station. At the crime scene, police obtained a handprint believed to be the killer&#x27;s. Images of the suspect from the store&#x27;s surveillance system were released by police and published on 13 and 14 September.

A man was apprehended on 16 September and detained as a suspect on &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; (the lowest level of suspicion), but was released a week later without charge. On 24 September, the police announced that a suspect had been apprehended and arrested at a higher level of suspicion: &quot;probable cause&quot;. He was subsequently identified as Mijailo Mijailović (born in Sweden to Serb parents). It was announced that Mijailović&#x27;s DNA profile matched that of hairs on a baseball cap left at (or near) the scene of the crime, and he resembled the man filmed in the store where Lindh was attacked.

After denying all involvement, Mijailović confessed to the crime on 6 January 2004, providing a full account of the events of 10 September during police questioning; his lawyer Peter Althin stated that it was a &quot;random act&quot; and not politically motivated. He was found guilty in a trial held from 14 to 17 January 2004. After a psychiatric evaluation he was sentenced to life imprisonment on 23 March. On 8 July, an appeals court overturned Mijailović&#x27;s sentence (after tests concluded he was mentally ill at the time of the murder), and recommended he be transferred to a psychiatric ward. Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Sweden, which reinstated his sentence to life imprisonment on 2 December of that year. Mijailović renounced his Swedish citizenship, and has unsuccessfully requested to be transferred to Serbia. 

Despite Lindh&#x27;s popularity and the timing of the assassination, the murder was not considered a political act (although a newspaper found a picture of Mijailović listening to Liberal People&#x27;s Party leader Lars Leijonborg in clothing similar to what he wore during the murder). Mijailović admitted that he found the speech &quot;entertaining&quot;, but denied allegations that it influenced his actions. In a 2011 interview with the newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot;, Mijailović said he had &quot;felt hatred of [all] politicians&quot; at the time, he had been high on a hypnotic drug at the time, and it was &quot;a coincidence&quot; that his victim had been Lindh. Mijailović has received counselling and other support services since his imprisonment.

=== Reaction and legacy ===

Lindh was an outspoken campaigner for Sweden to join the Eurozone in the referendum held on 14 September 2003. After the attack, all euro-campaign events were immediately cancelled. Television campaign advertisements were withdrawn, and all TV stations in Sweden halted commercials from the evening of the 10th through the 11th to help the public broadcasting  channels of Sveriges Television report news.

In a meeting on 12 September between Prime Minister Göran Persson and the leaders of the other political parties in the Riksdag, it was decided that information and resources on the referendum&#x27;s issues would remain fully available but no further political campaigning or debate would take place. Party leaders unanimously pledged support for the ballot as planned and to abide by its result. Despite speculation that sympathy for Lindh could influence voting, the referendum rejected the euro. Following her death, Junior Foreign Affairs Minister Jan O. Karlsson was appointed acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. In October of that year, Laila Freivalds was appointed the successor to Lindh&#x27;s cabinet post.

Several commemorative gatherings were held for Lindh throughout Sweden and through the Church of Sweden Abroad on 12 and 13 September. One gathering in the centre of Stockholm attracted tens of thousands of mourners. A more formal commemoration was held at Stockholm City Hall on 19 September, at which King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf, Prime Minister Göran Persson, Chris Patten, Margot Wallström, European commissioners and the Swedish-speaking Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou spoke. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was unable to attend due to travel difficulties, but sent condolences. Lindh was buried privately on 20 September at the Church of in Stockholm; her grave is in the cemetery of nearby Katarina Church. Thousands of roses and candles were placed at Rosenbad and outside the store where she was murdered. Abroad, hundreds of thousands of flowers and candles were left at Swedish embassies and consulates by mourners.

In April 2004, Lindh posthumously received the &quot;Statesman of the Year Award&quot; from the EastWest Institute, a trans-Atlantic think tank that organizes an annual security conference in Brussels. Room 50.4 on the fifth floor of the Justus Lipsius European Council building in Brussels was named the Anna Lindh Room in her honour, and committee room 1A 002 in the Paul Henri Spaak building of the European Parliament in Brussels named the Anna Lindh Room in her memory.

The Anna Lindh Professorship of Practice of Global Leadership and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, was established in her honour. Human rights advocate Samantha Power was the inaugural appointee in 2006. The library at the Swedish National Defence College (&quot;Försvarshögskolan&quot;) is known as the Anna Lindh Library in her memory. On 11 September 2013, the tenth anniversary of Lindh&#x27;s death was commemorated in Sweden.

The Anna Lindh Memorial Fund () gives an annual award, the Anna Lindh Prize, to a person or institution with &quot;the courage to fight indifference, prejudice, oppression and injustices in order to promote a good life for all people in an environment marked by respect for human rights.&quot; The prize carries an award of SEK 150,000. In addition, the fund makes grants, which &quot;aim to encourage projects in Anna Lindh&#x27;s spirit&quot;, of SEK 25,000 to Swedish individuals. Laureates are: Amira Hass, journalist (Israel, 2004); Tostan and Anna Lindh Association (Senegal, 2005); Tatsiana Revjaka (Belarus, 2006); Khin Ohmar (Myanmar 2008); Mohamed Nasheed (Maldives, 2009); Jean Zaru (Palestine, 2010)

 Centre for Liberian Assistance (Liberia, 2011); Center for Roma Initiatives (Montenegro, 2012); Madeleine Albright (United States, 2013); Leslee Udwin (United Kingdom, 2015); Svitlana Zalishchuk (Ukraine, 2016) and Mina Dennert (Sweden, 2017).

<text>Ralf Schumacher (born 30 June 1975) is a German former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Schumacher won six Formula One Grands Prix across 11 seasons.

Born and raised in North Rhine-Westphalia, Schumacher is the younger brother of seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher, and the pair remain the only siblings to each win a Formula One Grand Prix. Schumacher began karting at the age of three and achieved early success before making the transition to automobile racing in the German Formula Three Championship and the Formula Nippon series. He first drove in Formula One with Jordan Grand Prix for the 1997 season. Schumacher moved to the Williams team in 1999, finishing sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship that year. He won his first Grand Prix in 2001, en-route to fourth place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and subsequently won five more races over the course of two years.

Schumacher left Williams at the end of 2004 and joined Toyota Racing in 2005. His performance throughout 2006 and 2007 resulted in Schumacher leaving Formula One as a result of internal pressure. After leaving Formula One, Schumacher joined the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) in 2008, achieving minor success, and retired from motorsport at the end of 2012 to enter a managerial role within DTM, mentoring young drivers. He is now a co-commentator for Sky Sport in Germany.

==Early life and career==
Schumacher was born in Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany, on 30 June 1975, the second son of Rolf Schumacher, a bricklayer, and his wife Elisabeth. Michael Schumacher is his elder brother. He began karting at the age of three driving on his parents&#x27; go-kart track in Kerpen. Schumacher&#x27;s first major karting success came when he clinched the NRW Cup and the Gold Cup in 1991. In 1992, he won the German Junior Kart Championship. He then moved up into the senior series, finishing runner-up.

Aged 17, Schumacher moved into car racing, finishing runner-up in the ADAC Junior Formula Championship. This performance allowed Schumacher to test a Formula Three car during 1992, and later took part in a Formula Three event. His testing and one-off appearance in the series caught the attention of WTS Racing, allowing Schumacher to enter the German Formula Three Championship in 1994, where he finished third. He finished fourth and thirtieth in the Macau Grand Prix and the Masters of Formula 3, respectively.

His performances in 1995 had improved over the previous year. Schumacher secured pole position and victory in the Macau Grand Prix and finished second in the Masters of Formula 3. In the German Formula Three series, Schumacher took three victories and finished second in the Championship behind Norberto Fontana. For 1996, Schumacher&#x27;s manager Willi Weber secured him a seat in the Formula Nippon Series, driving for the Team Le Mans alongside experienced driver Naoki Hattori. Schumacher won the series on his first attempt, becoming the first rookie driver to clinch the championship. In the same year, Schumacher and Hattori entered the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship, winning four races and taking the runner-up spot in the GT500 Championship behind the pairing of David Brabham and John Nielsen.

==Formula One career==

===Jordan (1997–1998)===

====1997====
In August 1996, Schumacher tested for the McLaren team at Silverstone. In September, it was announced that Schumacher had signed a three-year contract to drive for the Jordan team. The deal also brought in a further £8 million from Schumacher&#x27;s sponsor Bitburger brewery, with a small percentage going towards his salary. In January 1997, Giancarlo Fisichella was confirmed as Schumacher&#x27;s teammate replacing Martin Brundle, who expressed a desire to remain with the team. Schumacher believed that Brundle&#x27;s experience would have helped him in the coming season.

Schumacher took the first podium of his career in Argentina with third place despite a collision with teammate Fisichella. Further consecutive retirements followed in the next four races before picking up a sixth-place finish in France. Schumacher followed this result by picking up consecutive fifth-place finishes in the following three races. A further two retirements followed in the races in Belgium and Italy, before picking up a fifth-place finish in Austria. Schumacher did not score points in the final three races of the season, which included retirements in the Luxembourg Grand Prix and the European Grand Prix. In his début 1997 season, Schuamcher finished 11th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring 13 points.

Like all male German citizens, Schumacher was subject to compulsory military service in the German Armed Forces. Outside Formula One, Schumacher participated in the FIA GT Championship as a guest driver for the AMG Mercedes team at the Spa 4 Hours and was partnered by Klaus Ludwig. The pair finished fifth, scoring two points.

====1998====
For 1998, Schumacher remained at Jordan and was partnered by 1996 Drivers&#x27; Champion Damon Hill. Schumacher endured a horrid start as he suffered from retirements in the first three races, and managed to finish in the races in San Marino and Spain, albeit outside the points scoring positions. Schumacher suffered from further consecutive retirements in the next two races, and managed to finish 16th in France. He took his and Jordan&#x27;s first point of the season with a sixth-place finish at the British Grand Prix, before picking up further consecutive points finishes in the next two races. 

Schumacher went on to secure second place in Belgium behind teammate Hill. Schumacher was issued with team orders to prevent him from overtaking Hill, which caused a strain in the relationship between Schumacher and Jordan. Schumacher managed to take his second consecutive podium with third place in Italy. After this race, it was announced that Schumacher signed a two-year contract to drive for the Williams team, alongside Alessandro Zanardi; with Williams partnering BMW from 2000 onwards, one of BMW&#x27;s stipulations was to have a German driver in the team. Reportedly, this came after Michael Schumacher verbally declared to Eddie Jordan that his younger brother would never race for his team again and offering to buy him out of his contract with the team. According to Jordan himself 22 years later, Schumacher&#x27;s elder brother actually paid the money of 2 million GBP to terminate his contract. He finished the season with consecutive retirements in the final two races, and clinched 10th place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 14 points. He was replaced at Jordan for 1999 by Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who left Williams after two generally unsuccessful seasons.

===Williams (1999–2004)===

====1999====

Schumacher began his season by finishing third in Australia, which was followed up with a fourth-place finish in Brazil. He suffered consecutive retirements in the next two races—he spun off in San Marino and suffered an accident in Monaco. Schumacher was able to take further points in the next two races in Spain, Canada, and France. Schumacher took a further podium position with third place in Britain but retired from the next race in Austria due to a spin. He took further points in the German Grand Prix, before taking a ninth-place finish in Hungary.

In Belgium, Schumacher took fifth place helped by a one-stop strategy earning him a better finish. In October, it was announced that Schumacher&#x27;s contract was extended to a three-year deal worth $31 million. He rounded off the season with a fifth-place finish in Japan. Schumacher finished the 1999 season sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 35 points.

====2000====
Schumacher continued to drive for Williams in 2000, and was partnered by rookie driver and future World Champion Jenson Button. His season started well as he managed to take third place in the opening race in Australia, and clinched fifth position in Brazil. He was forced to retire from the San Marino Grand Prix due to a fuel system issue but managed to clinch consecutive fourth-place finishes in the next two races. Schumacher was forced into another retirement as he was caught in a collision involving Eddie Irvine and Jos Verstappen at the European Grand Prix, and another retirement followed in Monaco due to a crash where he suffered from a 3-inch cut across his calf.

Schumacher was passed fit to participate in the Canadian Grand Prix, where he was classified 14th after being hit in the closing stages by BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve. Schumacher managed to take fifth place in France, before suffering a brake failure that forced him to retire in Austria. He managed to finish the next four races, which included consecutive third-place finishes in Belgium and Italy. Despite these results, he was unable to finish the final three races of the season. Schumacher finished fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 24 points.

====2001====

At the opening round in Australia, Schumacher retired after a collision with BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve, which resulted in the death of race marshal Graham Beveridge. He scored his first points of the season with a fifth-place finish in Malaysia, and later spun off in the next race in Brazil, which included a collision with Barrichello early in the race. In the succeeding round at the San Marino Grand Prix, Schumacher started from third on the grid and led every lap of the race to take his first Formula One victory. The following three races saw Schumacher failing to finish.

Schumacher won his second career victory in Canadian Grand Prix, with his elder brother Michael Schumacher finishing second; the result marked the first one-two finish by siblings. These results were followed by a fourth-place finish at the European Grand Prix, and took second place in France. He was unable to finish the race in Britain due to a problem with his car&#x27;s engine. In Germany, Schumacher took his third and final win of the season having started from second on the grid. This result marked a good run of form as Schumacher scored points in three of the remaining five races, including a third-place finish in Italy. Schumacher finished the 2001 season fourth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 49 points.

====2002====

For 2002, Schumacher announced of his intention to wear glasses over the coming season to improve his vision. His decision was influenced after he was involved in a car crash on the Autobahn 3 when driving to visit his family. On 14 January, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), Formula One&#x27;s governing body, gave permission for Schumacher to wear glasses, and his helmet maker Schuberth developed padding with channels for the glass frames.

His season started in Australia with a first lap accident where his car was launched into the air after colliding with Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello. In the following race in Malaysia, Schumacher took his only victory of the season. He followed up the result by taking consecutive podiums in the next two races—a second place in Brazil, and a third-place finish in San Marino. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Schumacher ran wide on lap 29 while under pressure from teammate Montoya and eventually retired from an engine failure, although he was classified 11th. He managed to secure consecutive points finishes in the next two races, with a podium in Monaco. He followed these results by finishing in next eight races, which includes consecutive third-place finishes in Germany and Hungary. Schumacher rounded off the year with non-points finishes in the final three rounds which included a retirement in the United States. For the second consecutive season, Schumacher finished fourth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 42 points.

====2003====

In 2003, Schumacher again competed with Williams alongside Montoya. He was unable to take part in winter testing in January, prior to the season because of reoccurring back pains, although he later returned in February. He endured a good first half of the season, and scored points in the opening seven races and clinched his first podium of the season with second place in Canada. Schumacher backed up the results by taking consecutive victories in the European and French Grands Prix. At the German Grand Prix, Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race after a collision with Rubens Barrichello and Kimi Räikkönen, for which he received a 10 place grid penalty for the next race. Williams successfully appealed against the decision and Schumacher managed to qualify second for the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he finished fourth.

At a test held at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Schumacher suffered a high-speed accident where he sustained a concussion. He was taken for a precautionary check at the circuit&#x27;s medical centre before he was transferred to San Rafaele hospital. Although he had participated in the event&#x27;s first qualifying session, Schumacher decided to withdraw and his place was taken by Williams test driver Marc Gené. He returned for the United States Grand Prix, where he retired having suffered an accident resulting from his car sliding on a wet track surface. At the season finale in Japan, Schumacher finished 12th despite spinning his car three times. He finished the season fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 58 points, and helped Williams clinch second in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

====2004====

Schumacher remained at Williams for 2004 and continued to be partnered by Montoya. Schumacher was ambitious for the season, saying: &quot;I can say that we&#x27;ll come up with a car that will be competitive from the very first race of the new season.&quot; He made a good start to his season by finishing fourth in the opening round in Australia, although he retired from the next race in Malaysia from an engine failure. He managed to secure consecutive seventh-place finishes in the next two rounds, before finishing outside the points in Monaco. Schumacher was forced into retirement on the opening lap of the European Grand Prix due to a collision. At the Canadian Grand Prix, Schumacher qualified on pole position and went on to finish second in the race, but was later disqualified for irregularities on his car&#x27;s brake ducts.

At the United States Grand Prix, Schumacher suffered serious injuries in an accident that occurred on the ninth lap of the race. The deceleration was measured at 78 g (765 m/s²), resulting in a concussion as well as two minor fractures to his spinal column. Schumacher was forced to miss the next six races. As in 2003, Gené substituted for Schumacher for the races in France and Britain, with Antônio Pizzonia taking over the role for the next four races. In July, Schumacher signed a three-year contract with the Toyota team. Although he was passed fit for the Italian Grand Prix, Schumacher ultimately returned for the Chinese Grand Prix, where he retired from a puncture. Schumacher followed up the result by taking second place in Japan, and a fifth place at the final round in Brazil. He finished the season ninth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 24 points.

===Toyota (2005–2007)===

====2005====

For 2005, Schumacher was partnered by Jarno Trulli at Toyota and was hopeful about his prospects for the upcoming season. Schumacher secured his first two points scores of the season in Malaysia and Bahrain, and later finished outside the points in San Marino due to taking a 25-second penalty after finishing eighth due to causing an incident in his pitstops. Schumacher followed this up with consecutive points finishes in the next two races. He retired due to a spin during the European Grand Prix.

During the second practice session of the United States Grand Prix, Schumacher lost control of his car entering the final corner of the circuit, which resulted from a tyre failure. He was forced to miss the event and was replaced by Toyota test driver Ricardo Zonta. Schumacher returned for the French Grand Prix and began a run of four consecutive points scoring positions which included a podium finish in Hungary, and later finished outside the points in Turkey. This marked a turning point as Schumacher scored in all of the remaining races and took a podium position in the season finale in China. He finished the season sixth place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and helped Toyota clinch fourth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

====2006====

Schumacher continued at Toyota and was again partnered by Trulli for 2006. He was ambitious for the upcoming season, saying: &quot;We&#x27;re looking to win some races. That&#x27;s what our target should be and let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s a realistic one.&quot; He started the season with a non-points finish in Bahrain as both Toyota cars were off the pace. Schumacher managed to score his and Toyota&#x27;s first points of the season with eighth place in Malaysia. He managed to secure his and Toyota&#x27;s only podium finish of the season in Australia.

Schumacher took ninth place in San Marino but suffered consecutive retirements in the next three races. He was able to finish the next five consecutive races, which included points scoring positions in France, Hungary, and Turkey. He was unable to finish the races in China and Brazil due to problems with his car&#x27;s oil pressure and suspension, respectively. On 29 September, Schumacher was elected as the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers Association (GPDA), the trade union of Formula One drivers. He finished the season tenth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and scored 20 points.

====2007====

Schumacher remained at Toyota and continued to be partnered by Trulli for 2007. Despite Toyota&#x27;s performances during 2006, Schumacher was optimistic for the upcoming season. Schumacher took eighth position at the opening round in Australia, and finished outside the points-scoring positions in the next two rounds. At the Spanish Grand Prix, he was involved in a collision with Williams driver Alexander Wurz and eventually retired with a mechanical issue. After finishing 16th at the Monaco Grand Prix, it was reported that Toyota were unhappy with his performances and faced pressure of possibly being replaced before the season concluded. Despite taking eighth place in Canada, Toyota Motorsport vice-chairman Tadashi Yamashina publicly urged Schumacher to improve his performances as he had qualified 18th for the race.

At the next Grand Prix in the United States,Schumacher spun off in the first corner and collided with the cars of David Coulthard and Rubens Barrichello. To ensure a greater chance of retaining his seat at Toyota, he offered to accept a $17 million pay cut. Schumacher did not finish the races at the British Grand Prix, and the European Grand Prix from a mechanical failure and a collision with BMW Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld, respectively. Schumacher later scored a further point for Toyota in Hungary, before taking consecutive finishes outside the points in the next three races. He was unable to finish the race in Japan having sustained a puncture. On 1 October, it was announced by Schumacher that he would leave Toyota at the end of the season. Schumacher spun off in the next race in China and secured an 11th-place finish in the season finale in Brazil. Schumacher ended his final season in Formula One 16th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 5 points.

===Attempted comebacks===
Before and after his departure from Toyota, Schumacher was linked to several teams in Formula One. He held talks with long-time mentor and Toro Rosso team principal Franz Tost about a possible drive for the team, who ultimately opted to sign Sebastian Vettel and Sébastien Bourdais. Schumacher later approached McLaren to enquire about a seat that was vacated by Fernando Alonso; he was later turned down. Despite these setbacks, Schumacher remained certain that a Formula One seat would be available for 2008.

Schumacher&#x27;s final participation in Formula One came at a test held for the newly formed Force India team in December 2007. This was a bid to secure a race seat alongside fellow German Adrian Sutil. During the test, Schumacher was the slowest driver, and later announced that he would not join the team for 2008, and that the possibility of participating in Formula One would be unlikely. After spending two seasons away from the sport, Schumacher&#x27;s experience made him a target for the new teams US F1, Hispania (HRT), Virgin, and Lotus that entered the 2010 season, all of whom he rejected.

==Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (2008–2012)==

===2008===

On 18 February 2008, it was announced that Schumacher would be driving in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) series in 2008, driving for Mücke Motorsport and was partnered by Maro Engel. Making his début at the Hockenheimring, Schumacher managed to finish 14th, which he followed up with a 10th-place finish at Oschersleben. He was forced into retirement at the next race at Lausitz, and managed to finish in the next three races he entered, albeit outside the points scoring positions. He secured his first points in the DTM series by finishing eighth at the Nürburgring.

Schumacher rounded off the season with a retirement at the Bugatti Circuit and a 14th-place finish at the Hockenheimring. He finished the season 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 3 points.

===2009===

For 2009, it was announced that Schumacher had extended his contract to drive for Mercedes-Benz and would move to the HWA Team, and was partnered by Paul di Resta, Bruno Spengler, and Gary Paffett. Schumacher managed to finish the first two races, although he did not finish in the points scoring positions. He secured his first points of the season with a sixth-place finish at the Norisring, which he followed up with 10th and 11th-place finishes in the races at Zandvoort and Oschersleben respectively.

Schumacher managed to secure his second point scoring position with a seventh place at the Nürburgring, and followed the result up by clinching consecutive finishes in the next two rounds at Brands Hatch and the Circuit de Catalunya. Schumacher took further points with a fifth-place finish at Dijon-Prenois and finished the season with a multi-car collision at the Hockenheimring. Schumacher finished the season 11th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and scored 9 points.

===2010===

On 23 March 2010, it was announced that Schumacher would be retained by HWA for 2010, and would be partnered by di Resta, Spengler and Gary Paffett. Schumacher&#x27;s season started with a ninth-place finish at the Hockenheimring, before he was forced into retirement due to a failure in his car&#x27;s electronic control in Valencia resulting in an misfire. Schumacher later secured finishes in the next two rounds, which he backed up with his first points of the season with sixth place at the Nürburgring.

This marked a turning point as Schumacher did not score points in the remaining six races. He suffered retirements in the races at Brands Hatch where he was involved in a collision and later suffered damage to his steering as a result of running off the race track His final retirement of 2010 came at the Hockenheimring where he was involved in another first lap collision. Schumacher finished the season 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring 3 points.

===2011===

On 6 April 2011, it was confirmed that Schumacher would remain at HWA for 2011 and was partnered by Paffett, Spengler, and Jamie Green. Schumacher started off the season by taking his first two podiums in DTM with third place at the Hockenheimring and second at the Red Bull Ring, which remained his best result in DTM. Schumacher was unable to take further points in Lausitz but managed to clinch sixth place in Norisring. Despite the early successes of Schumacher in the first part of the season, he was able to only secure one further point scoring finish at Brands Hatch, and suffered retirements at the races held at the Nürburgring, where he collided with Mücke driver David Coulthard and received a suspended penalty, and Oscherleben, from a collision with Audi driver Filipe Albuquerque. Schumacher managed to finish the races in Valencia and at the Hockenheimring, albeit outside the point scoring positions. Schumacher finished the season eighth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring 21 points.

===2012===
On 20 October 2011, it was announced that Schumacher would remain at HWA for the 2012 season, and was once again partnered by Green and Paffett who were joined by new signing Christian Vietoris. Schumacher&#x27;s season got off well as he clinched consecutive points scoring finishes in the first two races of the season, and managed to secure further finishes in the races held at Brands Hatch and the Red Bull Ring, although Schumacher did not finish in the points scoring positions. He was forced into retirement at the next race held at the Norisring due to an electrical failure while leading. This marked a turning point in Schumacher&#x27;s season as he managed to finish the remaining five races of the season, including two points finishes in the races held at Zandvoort and the season finale at the Hockenheimring. Schumacher finished the season 17th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 10 points.

==Post-DTM career==
Schumacher announced his retirement from active motorsport in March 2013 and would enter a management role at Mücke Motorsport, as well as becoming a shareholder in the team. In his role, he assists in the mentoring of young drivers signed with Mercedes-Benz. Schumacher had a guest role in an episode of the RTL television crime series &quot;Alarm for Cobra 11 – The Highway Police&quot; in 2015. He took over the running of the ADAC Formula 4 team HTP Junior Team Ungar with Mercedes DTM technical chief Gerhard Ungar from 2016; Schumacher had previously with Peter Mücke ran the Berlin-based RSC Mücke Motorsport team in the GP3 Series in 2010 and 2011.

In 2019, Schumacher became a pundit and co-commentator at Formula One races for the pay-TV channel Sky Deutschland. He made a one-off return to racing when he entered the Nürburgring round of the Prototype Cup Germany and shared a US Racing-fielded Ligier JS P320 LMP3 car with his son David in August 2024. The duo won the two races held that weekend.

==Personal life==
In April 2001, Schumacher became engaged to Cora-Caroline Brinkmann, a former model; they were married on 5 October that year in a private civil ceremony at the couple&#x27;s home in Hallwang, Austria. On 23 October 2001, their son David Schumacher was born three weeks premature. David also went on to become a racing driver. Outside motorsport, Ralf enjoys cycling, tennis, and backgammon.

On 20 February 2015, Schumacher&#x27;s lawyer confirmed that Schumacher and his wife had divorced after an acrimonious period of separation. The couple fought a custody battle over their son, and Schumacher&#x27;s estimated €100 million fortune, which was resolved with Cora receiving a €6 million settlement and the family home at Bergheim. Schumacher was appointed a Laureus Ambassador at the Laureus World Sports Awards for the Laureus Foundation in 2011.

Schumacher is a prominent supporter of the Gut Aiderbichl animal sanctuary, situated near Salzburg. Animal rights activists accused Schumacher of hypocrisy as he was known as a passionate hunter in his spare time. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticized Schumacher as he was accused of paying £35,000 to shoot three deer in a defined area in 2007.

On 14 July 2024, Schumacher announced on social media that he has been in a same-sex relationship with his partner of two years, 34-year-old Étienne Bousquet-Cassagne.

<text>Runs created (RC) is a baseball statistic invented by Bill James to estimate the number of runs a hitter contributes to their team.

==Purpose==
James explains in his book, &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, why he believes runs created is an essential thing to measure:With regard to an offensive player, the first key question is how many &quot;runs&quot; have resulted from what he has done with the bat and on the basepaths. Willie McCovey hit .270 in his career, with 353 doubles, 46 triples, 521 home runs and 1,345 walks -- but his job was not to hit doubles, nor to hit singles, nor to hit triples, nor to draw walks or even hit home runs, but rather to put runs on the scoreboard. How many runs resulted from all of these things?

Runs created attempts to answer this bedrock question. The conceptual framework of the &quot;runs created&quot; stat is:

formula_1

where

*A = On-base factor
*B = Advancement factor
*C = Opportunity factor

==Formula==

===Basic runs created===

In the most basic runs created formula:

formula_2

where H is hits, BB is base on balls, TB is total bases and AB is at-bats.

This can also be expressed as

formula_3

formula_4

where OBP is on-base percentage, SLG is slugging average, AB is at-bats and TB is total bases, however OBP includes the hit-by-pitch while the previous RC formula does not.

===&quot;Stolen base&quot; version of runs created===

This formula expands on the basic formula by accounting for a player&#x27;s basestealing ability.

formula_5

where H is hits, BB is base on balls, CS is caught stealing, TB is total bases, SB is stolen bases, and AB is at bats.

===&quot;Technical&quot; version of runs created===

This formula accounts for all basic, easily available offensive statistics.

formula_6

where H is hits, BB is base on balls, CS is caught stealing, HBP is hit by pitch, GIDP is grounded into double play, TB is total bases, IBB is intentional base on balls, SH is sacrifice hit, SF is sacrifice fly, SB is stolen base, and AB is at bats.

===2002 version of runs created===

Earlier versions of runs created overestimated the number of runs created by players with extremely high A and B factors (on-base and slugging), such as Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Barry Bonds. This is because these formulas placed a player in an offensive context of players equal to himself; it is as if the player is assumed to be on base for himself when he hits home runs. Of course, this is impossible, and in reality, a great player is interacting with offensive players whose contributions are inferior to his. The 2002 version corrects this by placing the player in the context of his real-life team. This 2002 version also takes into account performance in &quot;clutch&quot; situations.

:A: formula_7
:B: formula_8
:C: formula_9

where K is strikeout.

The initial individual runs created estimate is then:

formula_10

If situational hitting information is available, the following should be added to the above total:

formula_11

where RISP is runners in scoring position, BA is batting average, HR is home run, and ROB is runners on base. The subscripts indicate the required condition for the formula. For example, formula_12 means &quot;hits while runners are in scoring position.&quot;

This is then figured for every member of the team, and an estimate of total team runs scored is added up. The actual total of team runs scored is then divided by the estimated total team runs scored, yielding a ratio of real to estimated team runs scored. The above individual runs created estimate is then multiplied by this ratio, to yield a runs created estimate for the individual.

===Other expressions of runs created===
====Another Version====
Another, simpler, way to calculate runs created is to add runs to runs batted in (RBI) subtracted by home runs. The reason for this when you hit a home run, you earn a run, because you scored a run, and an RBI, because you batted yourself in.
====Weighted runs created plus====

Weighted runs created plus (wRC+) takes runs created and adjusts it to account for ballpark factors and the era a player played in.

====Runs created as a rate stat====
The same information provided by runs created can be expressed as a rate stat, rather than a raw number of runs contributed. This is usually expressed as runs created per some number of outs, e.g. formula_13 (27 being the number of outs per team in a standard 9-inning baseball game).

==Accuracy==

Runs created is believed to be an accurate measure of an individual&#x27;s offensive contribution because when used on whole teams, the formula normally closely approximates how many runs the team actually scores. Even the basic version of runs created usually predicts a team&#x27;s run total within a 5% margin of error. Other, more advanced versions are even more accurate.

<text>The &#x27; (Latin for &quot;Linen Book of Zagreb&quot;, also known rarely as &#x27;, &quot;Book of Agram&quot;) is the longest Etruscan text and the only extant linen book (libri lintei), dated to the 3rd century BC, making it arguably the oldest extant European book. (The second longest Etruscan text, Tabula Capuana, also seems to be a ritual calendar.) Much of it is untranslated because of the lack of knowledge about the Etruscan language, though the words and phrases which can be understood indicate that the text is most likely a ritual calendar. Miles Beckwith states with regard to this text that &quot;in the last thirty or forty years, our understanding of Etruscan has increased substantially,&quot; and L. B. van der Meer has published a word-by-word analysis of the entire text.

The fabric of the book was preserved when it was used for mummy wrappings in Ptolemaic Egypt. The mummy was bought in Alexandria in 1848 and since 1867 both the mummy and the manuscript have been kept in Zagreb, Croatia, now in a refrigerated room at the Archaeological Museum.

==History of discovery==

In 1848, Mihajlo Barić (1791–1859), a low ranking Croatian official in the Hungarian Royal Chancellery, resigned his post and embarked upon a tour of several countries, including Egypt. While in Alexandria, he purchased a sarcophagus containing a female mummy, as a souvenir of his travels. Barić displayed the mummy at his home in Vienna, standing it upright in the corner of his sitting room. At some point he removed the linen wrappings and put them on display in a separate glass case, though it seems he had never noticed the inscriptions or their importance.

The mummy remained on display at his home until his death in 1859, when it passed into possession of his brother Ilija, a priest in Slavonia. As he took no interest in the mummy, he donated it in 1867 to the State Institute of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia in Zagreb (the present-day Archaeological Museum in Zagreb). Their catalogue described it as follows:

:Mummy of a young woman (with wrappings removed) standing in a glass case and held upright by an iron rod. Another glass case contains the mummy&#x27;s bandages which are completely covered with writing in an unknown and hitherto undeciphered language, representing an outstanding treasure of the National Museum.

The mummy and its wrappings were examined the same year by the German Egyptologist Heinrich Brugsch, who noticed the text, but believed them to be Egyptian hieroglyphs. He did not undertake any further research on the text, until 1877, when a chance conversation with Richard Burton about runes made him realise that the writing was not Egyptian. They realised the text was potentially important, but wrongly concluded that it was a transliteration of the Egyptian Book of the Dead in the Arabic script.

In 1891, the wrappings were transported to Vienna, where they were thoroughly examined by Jakob Krall, an expert on the Coptic language, who expected the writing to be either Coptic, Libyan or Carian. In 1892, Krall was the first to identify the language as Etruscan and reassemble the strips. It was his work that established that the linen wrappings constituted a manuscript written in Etruscan.

At first, the provenance and identity of the mummy were unknown, due to the irregular nature of its excavation and sale. This resulted in speculation that the mummy may have had some association with either the or the Etruscans. A papyrus found within her sarcophagus was identified as an Egyptian Book of the Dead, which included the details of an Egyptian woman named Nesi-hensu, the wife of Paher-hensu, a tailor from Thebes. This discovery has been used as evidence to suggest that the mummy is the Nesi-hensu mentioned on the papyrus. However, later analysis of the papyrus has suggested that it postdates the mummy by nearly a century, which could suggest that the mummy is not Nesi-hensu.

She was 30–40 years old at the time of her death, and wore a necklace, with traces of flowers and gold in her hair. Among the fragments of the accompanying wreath, there was a cat skull.

==Text==

===Date and origin===
On paleographic grounds, the manuscript is dated to approximately 250 BC (though carbon dating put manufacture of the linen textile itself at 390 BC +/- 45 years).
Certain local gods mentioned within the text allow the &#x27;s place of production to be narrowed to a small area in the southeast of Tuscany near Lake Trasimeno, where four major Etruscan cities were located: modern day Arezzo, Perugia, Chiusi and Cortona.

===Structure===

The book is laid out in twelve columns from right to left, each one representing a &quot;page&quot;. Much of the first three columns is missing, and it is not known where the book begins. Closer to the end of the book the text is almost complete (there is a strip missing that runs the entire length of the book). By the end of the last page the cloth is blank and the selvage is intact, showing the definite end of the book.

There are 230 lines of text, with 1330 legible words, but only about 500 distinct words or roots. Only about 60% of the text is thought to have been preserved. Black ink has been used for the main text, and red ink for lines and diacritics.

In use, it would have been folded so that one page lay on top of another like a codex, rather than being wound along like a scroll. Julius Caesar is said to have folded scrolls in similar accordion fashion while on campaigns.

===Content===
Though the Etruscan language is not fully understood, many words and phrases can be deciphered, enough to give us an indication of the subject matter. Both dates and the names of gods are found throughout the text, giving the impression that the book is a religious calendar. Such calendars are known from the Roman world, giving not only the dates of ceremonies and processions, but also the rituals and liturgies involved. The lost are referred to by several Roman antiquarians.

The theory that this is a religious text is strengthened by recurring words and phrases that are surmised to have liturgical or dedicatory meanings. Some notable formulae on the Liber Linteus include a hymn-like repetition of in column 7, and variations on the phrase , which is translated by van der Meer as &quot;by the sacred fraternity/priesthood of , and by the of &quot;.

Though many of the specific details of the rituals are unclear, they seem to have been performed outside cities, sometimes near specific rivers, sometimes on (or at least for) hilltops/citadels, sometimes apparently in cemeteries. Based on the two unambiguous dates that survive — June 18 in 6.14 and September 24 in 8.2 — it is supposed that roughly columns 1-5 deal with rituals occurring in the months before June (probably starting in March, and perhaps there was introductory or other material here as well), column 6 with June rituals, column 7 may refer to rituals in July and possibly August, column 8 September rituals, and 9-12 concerning rites to be performed from October through February. Other numbers are mentioned which are probably also dates, but as the months are not indicated, we cannot be sure where exactly they fall in the year.

Throughout this calendar there is also a fairly clear progression of which kinds of deities are to be propitiated in which months and seasons. Only two individual gods are set off by being preceded by the term &quot;farθan fleres&quot;, probably &quot;the Genius (or Father?) of the spirit of/in...&quot; These are &quot;Crap-&quot; and &quot;Neθuns&quot;, the first probably equivalent to &quot;Tin&quot;, the Etruscan Jupiter, and the second roughly equivalent to Latin Neptune. It is notable that &quot;Crap-&quot;/Jupiter is mentioned in the first half of the text (in columns 3, 4, and 6), that is, up to June (specifically before the summer solstice on June 21), but he is not ever mentioned later in the calendar (as far as we can see in the text that is legible). On the other hand, &quot;Neθuns&quot;/Neptune does not occur (again, as far as we can see) in these earlier passages/months/seasons, but only after the autumnal equinox on September 21 (specifically just after September 24, mentioned in 8.3, then also 8.11, 9.18 and 9.22). 

Similarly, on the one hand, other deities of light, such as &quot;θesan&quot; &quot;Dawn&quot; and &quot;Lusa&quot; are only mentioned in the earlier part of the calendar: &quot;θesan&quot; at 5.19-20 &quot;θesan tini θesan eiseraś śeuś&quot; probably &quot;Dawn of (bright) Jupiter (and) Dawn of the Dark Deities,&quot; (probably referring to Venus as morning and evening star) and &quot;Lusa&quot; at 6.9; while, on the other hand, various terms thought or known to refer to specifically underworld deities exclusively appear later in the calendar: &quot;Satrs&quot; &quot;Saturn/Cronos&quot; (11.f4), &quot;Caθ-&quot; (in columns 10 and 12), &quot;Ceu-&quot; (at 7.8), &quot;Velθa&quot; (7, 10, and 11), and &quot;Veive-/Vetis&quot; = Latin &quot;Veiovis/Vedius,&quot; (described by van der Meer as an &quot;underworld Jupiter&quot;) in 10 and 11. 

But some of the apparent underworld deities, such as &quot;Zer&quot;, show up in both halves (4, 5, 9), while &quot;Lur&quot;, also thought to be chthonic, only appears in columns 5 and 6. van der Meer claims that many of the locations in the year of these deities&#x27; rituals correspond to the same deities&#x27; locations on the Liver of Piacenza and in other Etruscan sources that hint at how they divided the heavens or the divine realm. On the other hand, Belfiore considers &quot;Crap&quot; to be an underworld deity. 

There are a variety of types of ritual (the general term for which seems to be &quot;eis-na/ ais-na&quot; literally &quot;for the gods, divine (act)&quot;) described in the text. The most frequently mentioned include &quot;vacl&quot;, probably &quot;libation&quot;, usually of &quot;vinum&quot; &quot;wine&quot; (sometimes specifically &quot;new wine&quot;) but also of oil &quot;faś&quot; and other liquids whose identities are unclear; &quot;nunθen&quot; &quot;invoke&quot; or possibly &quot;offer (with an invokation)&quot;; &quot;θez-&quot; probably &quot;sacrifice&quot; but possibly &quot;to present&quot; sacrifice(s) or offering(s) (&quot;fler(χva)&quot;) often of &quot;zusle(va)&quot; &quot;piglet(s)&quot; (or perhaps some other animal). Offerings and sacrifices were placed: on the right and/or left &quot;hamΦeś leiveś&quot; (and variations thereof); on fire &quot;raχθ&quot;; on a stone (altar?) &quot;luθt(i)&quot;; on the ground &quot;cel-i&quot;; or with/on a decorated (?) litter &quot;cletram śrenχve&quot; among others. They were often performed three times &quot;ci-s-um/ci-z&quot; and often happened or were concluded during the morning &quot;cla θesan&quot; (a term that seems to mark the end of rituals in this text, since blank lines follow it, followed by a new (partial or complete) date). Column 7 (July and/or August?) may be devoted to describing a series of funereal rites connected to the Adonia festival ritually mourning the death of Aphrodite&#x27;s lover Adonis. 

A variety of types of priest, &quot;cepen&quot;, (but notably not civil authorities) are mentioned, but the exact distinctions between them are not completely clear: &quot;tutin&quot; &quot;of the village&quot;(?); &quot;ceren&quot;, &quot;θaurχ&quot; both &quot;of the tomb&quot;; &quot;cilθ-l/cva&quot; &quot;of the citadel(s)/hiltop(s)&quot;. Less clear are the kinds of priest indicated by the following (if they refer to priests at all): &quot;zec, zac, sve, θe, cluctra, flanaχ, χuru&quot; (&quot;arch-&quot;?), &quot;snuiuΦ&quot; (&quot;permanent&quot;?), &quot;cnticn-&quot; (&#x27;&quot;ad hoc&quot;?), &quot;truθur&quot; (&quot;omen interpreter from lightening&quot;?), &quot;peθereni&quot; (&quot;of the god Peθan&quot;?), &quot;saucsaθ&quot; ([priest] or [holy area]&quot;of the god Saucne&quot;) at 3.15 (3.15-3.17): &quot;vacl . an . ścanince . saucsaθ . persin / cletram . śrenχve . iχ . ścanince . ciz . vacl / ara&quot; roughly &quot;The libation which was poured to &quot;Sauc- Pers-&quot; (should be performed) with the decorated litter just as it had been poured (before); perform the libation three times.&quot; 

This seems to present a notable connection between the Liber Linteus and the second longest Etruscan text which happens to also be a ritual calendar, the Tabula Capuana (line 2), since the root &quot;sauc-&quot; seems to occur in both with the root &quot;vacl&quot; &quot;libation&quot; and also in a part of each text that probably corresponds to March (though that month is not directly named in any obvious way in either text).

===Short sample of the text and partial translation===

Column 3, strip C (There are no punctuation marks in the original beyond interpuncts between most words. Those provided here are to make it easier to match the original with the translation.)
::12 [fl]er, etnam tesim, etnam c[elucn],

A tentative partial translation: &quot;The sacrifice, be it funerary, [or] be it chthonic [is to be put] on the decorated litter. [Then] say: &#x27;The sacrifice and the dog(?) are presented as the offering.&#x27; And collect the goblets; and then present the puppy(?) and the dog(?). The libation that was poured in the [sacred area] of &quot;Saucne Persi&quot; [should be poured] just as it was poured on the decorated litter. Make the libation three times. Make the offering [as it has been] established, carry [it] out as is appropriate, [and] observe [the appropriate rituals](?).&quot;

Notes: &quot;Persi&quot; may refer to Perugia whose ancient name was Perusia. The last word, &quot;male&quot; is related to the well-attested Etruscan words for &quot;mirror&quot;: &quot;mal(e)na&quot; and &quot;malstria&quot;.

<text>Pythagorean expectation is a sports analytics formula devised by Bill James to estimate the percentage of games a baseball team &quot;should&quot; have won based on the number of runs they scored and allowed. Comparing a team&#x27;s actual and Pythagorean winning percentage can be used to make predictions and evaluate which teams are over-performing and under-performing. The name comes from the formula&#x27;s resemblance to the Pythagorean theorem.

The basic formula is:

:formula_1

where Win Ratio is the winning ratio generated by the formula. The expected number of wins would be the expected winning ratio multiplied by the number of games played.

==Empirical origin==
Empirically, this formula correlates fairly well with how baseball teams actually perform. However, statisticians since the invention of this formula found it to have a fairly routine error, generally about three games off. 

For example, the 2002 New York Yankees scored 897 runs and allowed 697 runs: according to James&#x27; original formula, the Yankees should have finished with a win percentage of .624.

:formula_2

Based on a 162-game season, the 2002 Yankees should have finished 101-61: they actually finished 103–58.

In efforts to fix this routine error, statisticians have performed numerous searches to find the ideal exponent.

If using a single-number exponent, 1.83 is the most accurate, and is the one used by baseball-reference.com. The updated formula therefore reads as follows:

:formula_3

The most widely known is the Pythagenport formula developed by Clay Davenport of Baseball Prospectus:
:formula_4

He concluded that the exponent should be calculated from a given team based on the team&#x27;s runs scored, runs allowed, and games. By not reducing the exponent to a single number for teams in any season, Davenport was able to report a 3.991 root-mean-square error as opposed to a 4.126 root-mean-square error for an exponent of 2.

Less well known but equally (if not more) effective is the formula, developed by David Smyth.
:formula_5

Davenport expressed his support for this formula, saying: 
After further review, I (Clay) have come to the conclusion that the so-called Smyth/Patriot method, aka Pythagenpat, is a better fit. In that, &quot;X&quot; = ((&quot;rs&quot; + &quot;ra&quot;)/&quot;g&quot;)0.287, although there is some wiggle room for disagreement in the exponent. Anyway, that equation is simpler, more elegant, and gets the better answer over a wider range of runs scored than Pythagenport, including the mandatory value of 1 at 1 rpg.
These formulas are only necessary when dealing with extreme situations in which the average number of runs scored per game is either very high or very low. For most situations, simply squaring each variable yields accurate results.

There are some systematic statistical deviations between actual winning percentage and expected winning percentage, which include bullpen quality and luck. In addition, the formula tends to regress toward the mean, as teams that win a lot of games tend to be underrepresented by the formula (meaning they &quot;should&quot; have won fewer games), and teams that lose a lot of games tend to be overrepresented (they &quot;should&quot; have won more).

A notable example is the 2016 Texas Rangers, who beat their predicted record by 13 games, finishing 95-67 while having an expected win–loss record of 82-80.

==&quot;Second-order&quot; and &quot;third-order&quot; wins==
In their Adjusted Standings Report, Baseball Prospectus refers to different &quot;orders&quot; of wins for a team. The basic order of wins is simply the number of games they have won. However, because a team&#x27;s record may not reflect its true talent due to luck, different measures of a team&#x27;s talent were developed.

First-order wins, based on pure run differential, are the number of expected wins generated by the &quot;pythagenport&quot; formula (see above). In addition, to further filter out the distortions of luck, Sabermetricians can also calculate a team&#x27;s &quot;expected&quot; runs scored and allowed via a runs created-type equation (the most accurate at the team level being Base Runs). These formulas result in the team&#x27;s expected number of runs given their offensive and defensive stats (total singles, doubles, walks, etc.), which helps to eliminate the luck factor of the order in which the team&#x27;s hits and walks came within an inning. Using these stats, sabermetricians can calculate how many runs a team &quot;should&quot; have scored or allowed.

By plugging these expected runs scored and allowed into the pythagorean formula, one can generate second-order wins, the number of wins a team deserves based on the number of runs they should have scored and allowed given their component offensive and defensive statistics. Third-order wins are second-order wins that have been adjusted for strength of schedule (the quality of the opponent&#x27;s pitching and hitting). Second- and third-order winning percentage has been shown to predict future actual team winning percentage better than both actual winning percentage and first-order winning percentage.

==Theoretical explanation==
Initially the correlation between the formula and actual winning percentage was simply an experimental observation. In 2003, Hein Hundal provided an inexact derivation of the formula and showed that the Pythagorean exponent was approximately 2/(&quot;σ&quot;) where &quot;σ&quot; was the standard deviation of runs scored by all teams divided by the average number of runs scored. In 2006, Professor Steven J. Miller provided a statistical derivation of the formula under some assumptions about baseball games: if runs for each team follow a Weibull distribution and the runs scored and allowed per game are statistically independent, then the formula gives the probability of winning.

More simply, the Pythagorean formula with exponent 2 follows immediately from two assumptions: that baseball teams win in proportion to their &quot;quality&quot;, and that their &quot;quality&quot; is measured by the ratio of their runs scored to their runs allowed. For example, if Team A has scored 50 runs and allowed 40, its quality measure would be 50/40 or 1.25. The quality measure for its (collective) opponent team B, in the games played against A, would be 40/50 (since runs scored by A are runs allowed by B, and vice versa), or 0.8. If each team wins in proportion to its quality, A&#x27;s probability of winning would be 1.25 / (1.25 + 0.8), which equals 502 / (502 + 402), the Pythagorean formula. The same relationship is true for any number of runs scored and allowed, as can be seen by writing the &quot;quality&quot; probability as [50/40] / [ 50/40 + 40/50], and clearing fractions.

The assumption that one measure of the quality of a team is given by the ratio of its runs scored to allowed is both natural and plausible; this is the formula by which individual victories (games) are determined. [There are other natural and plausible candidates for team quality measures, which, assuming a &quot;quality&quot; model, lead to corresponding winning percentage expectation formulas that are roughly as accurate as the Pythagorean ones.] The assumption that baseball teams win in proportion to their quality is not natural, but is plausible. It is not natural because the degree to which sports contestants win in proportion to their quality is dependent on the role that chance plays in the sport. If chance plays a very large role, then even a team with much higher quality than its opponents will win only a little more often than it loses. If chance plays very little role, then a team with only slightly higher quality than its opponents will win much more often than it loses. The latter is more the case in basketball, for various reasons, including that many more points are scored than in baseball (giving the team with higher quality more opportunities to demonstrate that quality, with correspondingly fewer opportunities for chance or luck to allow the lower-quality team to win.)

Baseball has just the right amount of chance in it to enable teams to win roughly in proportion to their quality, i.e. to produce a roughly Pythagorean result with exponent two. Basketball&#x27;s higher exponent of around 14 (see below) is due to the smaller role that chance plays in basketball. The fact that the most accurate (constant) Pythagorean exponent for baseball is around 1.83, slightly less than 2, can be explained by the fact that there is (apparently) slightly more chance in baseball than would allow teams to win in precise proportion to their quality. Bill James realized this long ago when noting that an improvement in accuracy on his original Pythagorean formula with exponent two could be realized by simply adding some constant number to the numerator, and twice the constant to the denominator. This moves the result slightly closer to .500, which is what a slightly larger role for chance would do, and what using the exponent of 1.83 (or any positive exponent less than two) does as well. Various candidates for that constant can be tried to see what gives a &quot;best fit&quot; to real life data.

The fact that the most accurate exponent for baseball Pythagorean formulas is a variable that is dependent on the total runs per game is also explainable by the role of chance, since the more total runs scored, the less likely it is that the result will be due to chance, rather than to the higher quality of the winning team having been manifested during the scoring opportunities. The larger the exponent, the farther away from a .500 winning percentage is the result of the corresponding Pythagorean formula, which is the same effect that a decreased role of chance creates. The fact that accurate formulas for variable exponents yield larger exponents as the total runs per game increases is thus in agreement with an understanding of the role that chance plays in sports.

In his 1981 Baseball Abstract, James explicitly developed another of his formulas, called the log5 formula (which has since proven to be empirically accurate), using the notion of 2 teams having a face-to-face winning percentage against each other in proportion to a &quot;quality&quot; measure. His quality measure was half the team&#x27;s &quot;wins ratio&quot; (or &quot;odds of winning&quot;). The wins ratio or odds of winning is the ratio of the team&#x27;s wins against the league to its losses against the league. [James did not seem aware at the time that his quality measure was expressible in terms of the wins ratio. Since in the quality model any constant factor in a quality measure eventually cancels, the quality measure is today better taken as simply the wins ratio itself, rather than half of it.] He then stated that the Pythagorean formula, which he had earlier developed empirically, for predicting winning percentage from runs, was &quot;the same thing&quot; as the log5 formula, though without a convincing demonstration or proof. His purported demonstration that they were the same boiled down to showing that the two different formulas simplified to the same expression in a special case, which is itself treated vaguely, and there is no recognition that the special case is not the general one. Nor did he subsequently promulgate to the public any explicit, quality-based model for the Pythagorean formula. As of 2013, there is still little public awareness in the sabermetric community that a simple &quot;teams win in proportion to quality&quot; model, using the runs ratio as the quality measure, leads directly to James&#x27;s original Pythagorean formula.

In the 1981 Abstract, James also says that he had first tried to create a &quot;log5&quot; formula by simply using the winning percentages of the teams in place of the runs in the Pythagorean formula, but that it did not give valid results. The reason, unknown to James at the time, is that his attempted formulation implies that the relative quality of teams is given by the ratio of their winning percentages. Yet this cannot be true if teams win in proportion to their quality, since a .900 team wins against its opponents, whose overall winning percentage is roughly .500, in a 9 to 1 ratio, rather than the 9 to 5 ratio of their .900 to .500 winning percentages. The empirical failure of his attempt led to his eventual, more circuitous (and ingenious) and successful approach to log5, which still used quality considerations, though without a full appreciation of the ultimate simplicity of the model and of its more general applicability and true structural similarity to his Pythagorean formula.

==Use in basketball==
American sports executive Daryl Morey was the first to adapt James&#x27; Pythagorean expectation to professional basketball while a researcher at STATS, Inc. He found that using 13.91 for the exponents provided an acceptable model for predicting won-lost percentages:

:formula_6

Daryl&#x27;s &quot;Modified Pythagorean Theorem&quot; was first published in &quot;STATS Basketball Scoreboard, 1993–94&quot;.

Noted basketball analyst Dean Oliver also applied James&#x27; Pythagorean theory to professional basketball. The result was similar.

Another noted basketball statistician, John Hollinger, uses a similar Pythagorean formula, except with 16.5 as the exponent.

==Use in the National Football League==
The formula has also been used in the National Football League by football stat website and publisher Football Outsiders, where it is known as Pythagorean projection.

The formula is used with an exponent of 2.37 and gives a projected winning percentage. That winning percentage is then multiplied by 17 (for the number of games played in an NFL season from 2021), to give a projected number of wins. This projected number given by the equation is referred to as Pythagorean wins.

:formula_7

The 2011 edition of &quot;Football Outsiders Almanac&quot; states, &quot;From 1988 through 2004, 11 of 16 Super Bowls were won by the team that led the NFL in Pythagorean wins, while only seven were won by the team with the most actual victories. Super Bowl champions that led the league in Pythagorean wins but not actual wins include the 2004 Patriots, 2000 Ravens, 1999 Rams and 1997 Broncos.&quot;

Although &quot;Football Outsiders Almanac&quot; acknowledges that the formula had been less-successful in picking Super Bowl participants from 2005–2008, it reasserted itself in 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, &quot;[t]he Pythagorean projection is also still a valuable predictor of year-to-year improvement. Teams that win a minimum of one full game more than their Pythagorean projection tend to regress the following year; teams that win a minimum of one full game less than their Pythagorean projection tend to improve the following year, particularly if they were at or above .500 despite their underachieving.

For example, the 2008 New Orleans Saints went 8–8 despite 9.5 Pythagorean wins, hinting at the improvement that came with the following year&#x27;s championship season.&quot;

The 2022 Minnesota Vikings were a great outlier in this regard, going 13-4 despite having 8.4 Pythagorean wins. Two years later, the 2024 Kansas City Chiefs surpassed this discrepancy by going 15-2 with a Pythagorean win total of 10.2 wins.

==Use in ice hockey==
In 2013, statistician Kevin Dayaratna and mathematician Steven J. Miller provided theoretical justification for applying the Pythagorean Expectation to ice hockey. In particular, they found that by making the same assumptions that Miller made in his 2007 study about baseball, specifically that goals scored and goals allowed follow statistically independent Weibull distributions, that the Pythagorean Expectation works just as well for ice hockey as it does for baseball. The Dayaratna and Miller study verified the statistical legitimacy of making these assumptions and estimated the Pythagorean exponent for ice hockey to be slightly above 2.

<text>In United States labor law, a jurisdictional strike is a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a union to assert its members&#x27; right to particular job assignments and to protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or to unorganized workers. (Labor unions use the term &quot;jurisdiction&quot; to refer to their claims to represent workers who perform a certain type of work and the right of their members to perform such work.) The Taft-Hartley amendments to the National Labor Relations Act empowered the National Labor Relations Board to resolve such jurisdictional disputes and authorized the General Counsel of the NLRB to seek an injunction barring such strikes. 

Jurisdictional strikes occur most frequently in the United States in the construction industry. Construction unions frequently resolve those disputes through a privately created adjustment system.

In other countries, jurisdiction strikes are often called demarcation disputes.

<text>St Michael&#x27;s Hamlet, also known as St Michael-in-the-Hamlet or simply St Michael&#x27;s, is a suburb of Liverpool, Merseyside, England and a Liverpool City Council Ward. It is located to the south of the city, bordered by Dingle, Aigburth and Mossley Hill.

==History==
During the Georgian and Victoria era, St Michael&#x27;s was a very wealthy parish, reflecting the wealth of the city of Liverpool. Its parish church, St Michael&#x27;s, is of a cast-iron construction by John Cragg, who was also responsible for St George&#x27;s and St Philip&#x27;s churches in the city.

==Description==
It is a residential area to the west of Aigburth Road, near Sefton Park. Housing is a mix of semi-detached and terraced houses, with a few detached developments near the waterfront. St Michaels is part of Aigburth, an adjacent suburb which is larger. St Michael&#x27;s Hamlet was designated a conservation area on 12 December 1968.

==Government==

The elected councillors for St. Michael&#x27;s are Cllr Sarah Jennings, Cllr Tom Crone and Cllr Anna Key (Green Party). The area is in the Liverpool, Riverside Parliamentary constituency.

==Transport==
The area is served by St Michaels railway station on Merseyrail&#x27;s Northern Line. Regular trains depart for Liverpool city centre, Southport and Hunts Cross. Regular buses run along Aigburth Road from Liverpool city centre, including services to Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

<doc id="315487" wikidata="Q203874" url="?curid=315487" title="Nickel silver">
<text>Nickel silver, maillechort, German silver, argentan, new silver, nickel brass, albata, or alpacca is a cupronickel (copper with nickel) alloy with the addition of zinc. The usual formulation is 60% copper, 20% nickel and 20% zinc. Nickel silver does not contain the element silver. It is named for its silvery appearance, which can make it attractive as a cheaper and more durable substitute. It is also well suited for being plated with silver.

A naturally occurring ore composition in China was smelted into the alloy known as &#x27; or &#x27; () (&#x27;white copper&#x27; or cupronickel). The name &quot;German Silver&quot; refers to the artificial recreation of the natural ore composition by German metallurgists. All modern, commercially important, nickel silvers (such as those standardized under ASTM B122) contain zinc and are sometimes considered a subset of brass.

==History==

Nickel silver was first used in China, where it was smelted from readily available unprocessed ore. During the Qing dynasty, it was &quot;smuggled into various parts of the East Indies&quot;, despite a government ban on the export of nickel silver. It became known in the West from imported wares called (Mandarin) or (Cantonese) ( , literally &quot;white copper&quot;), for which the silvery metal colour was used to imitate sterling silver. According to Berthold Laufer, it was identical to &quot;khar sini&quot;, one of the seven metals recognized by Jābir ibn Hayyān.
In Europe, consequently, it was at first called , which is about the way is pronounced in the Cantonese dialect. The earliest European mention of occurs in the year 1597. From then until the end of the eighteenth century there are references to it as having been exported from Canton to Europe. 

German artificial recreation of the natural ore composition, however, began to appear from about 1750 onward. In 1770, the Suhl metalworks were able to produce a similar alloy. In 1823, a German competition was held to perfect the production process: the goal was to develop an alloy that possessed the closest visual similarity to silver. The brothers Henniger in Berlin and Ernst August Geitner in Schneeberg independently achieved this goal. The manufacturer Berndorf named the trademark brand &quot;Alpacca&quot;, which became widely known in northern Europe for nickel silver. In 1830, the German process of manufacture was introduced into England, while exports of from China gradually stopped. In 1832, a form of German silver was also developed in Birmingham, England.

After the modern process for the production of electroplated nickel silver was patented in 1840 by George Richards Elkington and his cousin Henry Elkington in Birmingham, the development of electroplating caused nickel silver to become widely used. It formed an ideal, strong and bright substrate for the plating process. It was also used unplated in applications such as cutlery.

==Uses==
Nickel silver first became popular as a base metal for silver-plated cutlery and other silverware, notably the electroplated wares called EPNS (electroplated nickel silver). It is used in zippers, costume jewelry, for making musical instruments (e.g., flutes, clarinets), and is preferred for the track in electric model railway layouts, as its oxide is conductive. Better quality keys and lock cylinder pins are made of nickel silver for durability under heavy use. The alloy has been widely used in the production of coins (e.g. Portuguese escudo and the former GDR marks). Its industrial and technical uses include marine fittings and plumbing fixtures for its corrosion resistance, and heating coils for its high electrical resistance.

In the nineteenth century, particularly after 1868, North American Plains Indian metalsmiths were able to easily acquire sheets of German silver. They used them to cut, stamp, and cold hammer a wide range of accessories and also horse gear. Presently, Plains metalsmiths use German silver for pendants, pectorals, bracelets, armbands, hair plates, &quot;conchas&quot; (oval decorative plates for belts), earrings, belt buckles, necktie slides, stickpins, &quot;dush-tuhs&quot;, and tiaras. Nickel silver is the metal of choice among contemporary Kiowa and Pawnee in Oklahoma. Many of the metal fittings on modern higher-end equine harness and tack are of nickel silver.

Early in the twentieth century, German silver was used by automobile manufacturers before the advent of steel sheet metal. For example, the famous Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost of 1907 used German silver. After about 1920, it became widely used for pocketknife bolsters, due to its machinability and corrosion resistance. Prior to this, the most common metal was iron.
Musical instruments, including the flute, saxophone, trumpet, and French horn, string instrument frets, and electric guitar pickup parts, can be made of nickel silver. Many professional-level French horns are entirely made of nickel silver. Some saxophone manufacturers, such as Keilwerth, offer saxophones made of nickel silver (Shadow model); these are far rarer than traditional lacquered brass saxophones. Student-level flutes and piccolos are also made of silver-plated nickel silver, although upper-level models are likely to use sterling silver. Nickel silver produces a bright and powerful sound quality; an additional benefit is that the metal is harder and more corrosion resistant than brass. Because of its hardness, it is used for most clarinet, flute, oboe and similar wind instrument keys, normally silver-plated. It is used to produce the tubes (called staples) onto which oboe reeds are tied. 

Many parts of brass instruments are made of nickel silver, such as tubes, braces or valve mechanism. Trombone slides of many manufacturers offer a lightweight nickel silver (LT slide) option for faster slide action and weight balance. The material was used in the construction of the National tricone resophonic guitar. The frets of guitar, mandolin, banjo, bass, and related string instruments are typically nickel silver. Nickel silver is sometimes used as ornamentation on the great highland bagpipe.
Nickel silver is also used in artworks. The Dutch sculptor Willem Lenssinck has made several pieces from German silver. Outdoors art made from this material easily withstands all kinds of weather.

<doc id="315489" wikidata="Q7446116" url="?curid=315489" title="Sefton Park">
<text>Sefton Park is a public park in south Liverpool, England. The park is in a conservation district of the same name, It is the largest park in Liverpool. Suburbs neighbouring the park include Toxteth, Aigburth, Mossley Hill, Wavertree and St Michael&#x27;s Hamlet. The park is located roughly within the historic bounds of the large area of the former Royal Park, Toxteth Park.

The park is in area and is designated by English Heritage at Grade I in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. 

==History==
The site of the park was once within the boundaries of the Royal Deer Park of Toxteth which became &quot;disparked&quot; in 1591. The land eventually came under the Earl of Sefton&#x27;s control.

As Toxteth rapidly grew, green fields and woodland of Toxteth Park became narrow streets and courts packed by tiny uninhabitable houses where air was stagnant, little or no sanitation and running water was from one tap in the middle of the court. At the same time there was demand for large aristocratic mansions in the South of Liverpool. In 1862 the Borough Council Engineer recommended a site for this development. The Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act 1864 
permitted corporations to borrow sums of money of up to half a million pounds to be repaid over thirty years. This allowed steps to be taken towards land purchase for Sefton Park. In 1867 the Council purchased of land of the park&#x27;s development for £250,000 from the Earl of Sefton. 

Sefton Park is one of the largest in the &quot;ribbon of Parks&quot; originally envisaged in 1850s by the Liverpool Improvement Committee and which came eventually to include Newsham and Stanley Parks. Even though it was recognised by politicians that clean, fresh open spaces were now regarded as necessity there was an outcry from the public that £250,000 was extravagant and wasteful. The park&#x27;s layout was funded by selling plots of land for housing on the perimeter of neighbouring Princes Park.

Soon after, a European competition was launched to design a grand park. 29 entries were received and the competition was won by a French landscape architect Édouard André with work on the design also undertaken by Liverpool architect Lewis Hornblower. The park was opened on 20 May 1872 by Prince Arthur who dedicated it &quot;for the health and enjoyment of the townspeople&quot;. 

The Park design is based on circular, oval and marginal footpaths, framing green spaces, with two natural watercourses flowing into a man-made lake. Hornblower&#x27;s designs for the park lodges and entrances were elaborate structures, and included follies, shelters and boathouses. The parkland itself included a deer park and strong water theme with pools, waterfalls and stepping stones. Exclusive villas and ornamentation of the park reflected the city&#x27;s grandeur during the mid Victorian period when Liverpool was the second city of the Empire.

The perimeter road&#x27;s outer edge is lined with Victorian buildings constructed to around 1890, and Edwardian houses. Additional park development continued with the construction of the iron bridge in 1873.

The park had a gallops which led to it being nicknamed &quot;the Hyde Park of the North&quot; but was always referred to by locals as &quot;The Jockey Sands&quot;.

A major park improvement programme was undertaken in 1983, for the International Garden Festival, and 30 years later (2013) Sefton Park was granted the prestigious Green Flag Award for high standards.

==Sporting uses==
Sefton Park Cricket Club moved their ground to the park in 1876 and W. G. Grace was amongst the three Gloucestershire players who made up a &quot;South of England&quot; who won there in 1877. The park also has tennis courts, a bowling green, and a popular jogging circuit. It is also used every November to hold the European Cross Country Championships trial races for the British team, and makes up part of the route of various annual road races including the Liverpool Half Marathon, Rock &amp; Roll Marathon and Spring 10k.

==Entertainment uses==
The park has also been a site for Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s summer pops season, Africa Oyé and the Moscow State Circus. Bands have also played at the park in the &#x27;80s such as Echo and the Bunnymen.

In 2025 it was announced by the BBC and the Liverpool City Regional Authority that the park would be the location for the music festival, BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend in May 2025.

==Restoration==
In 2005 the park received provisional approval for a major £5 million Heritage Lottery funded renovation project which involves the refurbishment and improvement of many of the park&#x27;s features. The work began in June 2007 was expected to be completed in summer 2009. This work was very controversial with some regular users of the park as it included destroying trees and breeding sites of birds. The work led to the formation of the &quot;Friends of Sefton Park&quot; campaigns.

==Notable features of the park==
===Palm House===

This is a Grade II* three-tier dome conservatory palm house designed and built by MacKenzie and Moncur of Edinburgh which opened in 1896. Liverpool millionaire Henry Yates Thompson (the great nephew of the founder of Princes Park) gifted £10,000 to the city to fund the construction. It was designed in the tradition of Joseph Paxton&#x27;s glass houses and was stocked originally with a rich collection of exotic plants.

During the Liverpool Blitz of May 1941 a bomb fell nearby and shattered the glass. It was reglazed in 1950 at a cost of £6,163 with costs covered by War Restoration funds. A period of decline and deterioration culminated in its closure in the 1980s on grounds of safety.

In June 1992, a public meeting was held highlighting the dereliction and calling for restoration. A petition was presented to the City Council by what had become the &quot;Save the Palm House&quot; campaign. A public fund raising campaign was established, with a &quot;sponsor a pane&quot; programme generating over £35,000. This led directly to the conversion of Save the Palm House into a registered charity (Friends of Sefton Park Palm House). Among the supporters of the project were Liverpool jazz singer George Melly and actress Margi Clarke; Melly described it as &quot;the magical palace of my childhood&quot; and &quot;a fairy castle&quot;. The Palm House was partially repaired and reopened in 1993. It was fully restored at a cost of £3.5 million with Heritage Lottery and European funding and reopened in September 2001. It is now both a popular visitor attraction offering free and paid-for public entertainment and is venue for hire.

The eight &#x27;corners&#x27; of the Palm House are marked by statues by the French sculptor Léon-Joseph Chavalliaud. These include explorers Captain Cook, Christopher Columbus, navigators Gerardus Mercator and Henry the Navigator, botanists and explorers Charles Darwin, Carl Linnaeus and John Parkinson and landscape architect Andre le Notre. Inside the Palm House are two sculptures by Benjamin Edward Spence &quot;Highland Mary&quot; and &quot;The Angel&#x27;s Whisper&quot;.

The grounds of the Palm House feature a statue of Peter Pan which was one of the last works by the British sculptor Sir George Frampton. This is Grade II listed and is a replica of a similar statue given as a gift for the visiting public to Kensington Gardens by author J.M. Barrie. The statue was donated to the park by George Audley in 1928 and was unveiled in the presence of Barrie. It originally sat in Sefton Park but was damaged in the 1990s. It was restored at Liverpool&#x27;s Conservation Centre, and returned to the more secure location of the Palm House&#x27;s grounds in December 2005.

===Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain and Anteros statue===

This is Grade II listed and situated in the centre of the Park next to the café and former site of the aviary. The fountain, made from bronze and aluminium, was unveiled in 1932 and is a replica of the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain created by Sir Alfred Gilbert in London&#x27;s Piccadilly Circus. It was restored in 2008 with a new aluminium Anteros statue replacing the original which was residing in Liverpool&#x27;s Conservation Centre before the centre closed to the public.

===Obelisk===

The principal entrance to the Park, opposite Lodge Lane, is the location of the Samuel Smith memorial. This is in the form of a tall granite obelisk, which stands at the head of an avenue leading to the park’s central plaza, where the Shaftesbury fountain and central cafe stand, and where the aviary once stood.

The obelisk is mounted on a plinth with two (now non-functioning) drinking fountains either side (N&amp;S); above each is the legend &quot;&quot;Whosoever drinketh of this water  shall thirst again. But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give them shall never thirst&quot;, taken from St. John&#x27;s Gospel. Above the fountains on each side of the plinth are four bronze plaques representing Smith&#x27;s life and work. The front plaque (W) bears an image of Samuel Smith in high relief; and the two sides (N&amp;S) have images of Christian charity, and the rear (E) plaque bears an inscription detailing his biography, and underneath &quot;Them that honour Me, I will honour&quot;&quot;. The plaque also states that the monument was raised by public subscription.
The obelisk is Grade II listed.

===Other statues and facilities===
The park features a Gothic drinking fountain and several prominent statues including a memorial to William Rathbone V by Sir Thomas Brock unveiled in 1887. There is a bandstand, popular since the Victorian era, which is said to be the inspiration for The Beatles&#x27; song Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. An iron bridge was opened in 1873 which spans the Fairy Glen. There is a café in the centre of the park called the Aviary Cafe and a pirate themed children&#x27;s play area opened in 2009.

===Review field===
Barrage balloons and anti-aircraft guns were established on the Review Field in the Second World War.

===Field of Hope===

The Field of Hope is an area in the south-east quarter of the park. It was planted with thousands of daffodil bulbs through a charitable planting programme and continues to bloom each year.
In 1990 the Marie Curie centre in Woolton, which had received a donation of daffodils from Geests to be used for fundraising, had the idea of planting a &quot;Field of Hope&quot; in order to inspire cancer sufferers and carers. In co-operation with the city council, a million daffodils were planted across the south-east corner of the park. 
This has led to similar fields being established in other parts of the city, including Stanley Park, Clarke Gardens, and Woolton Village.

==Former features of the park==

===Aviary===
An aviary was introduced to the park in 1901 and was home to many exotic birds. After falling into disuse in the 1980s, the old cages were removed during the restoration project and replaced with a new curved viewing point overlooking new outside planting.

===The Concert===
The park also boasted a small open-air theatre – &quot;The Concert&quot; – near the café which featured singers, magicians and talent contests to entertain local children during the summer holidays. This was removed in the 1970s.

===Boating lake===
The lake was a popular venue for boating until the 1970s, with a jetty and boat hire facilities. The lake was totally emptied in 2007 for the extensive renovation work and all of the fish (which included specimen weights of carp, tench, roach, pike and golden orf) were caught with large nets and sent to various locations across the UK. Following its restoration, the lake was refilled in 2010.

===Others===
There was a small pirate ship located in one of the lakes until the early 1990s when it was removed due to falling into disrepair.

Ringo Starr mentions the park in his song &quot;In Liverpool&quot; on his album &quot;Ringo 2012&quot;
