<text>War on Islam or war against Islam is a term used to describe a concerted effort to harm, weaken or annihilate the societal system of Islam, using military, economic, social and cultural means, or means invading and interfering in Islamic countries under the pretext of the war on terror, or using the media to create a negative stereotype about Islam. The alleged perpetrators are non-Muslims, particularly the Western world and &quot;false Muslims&quot;, in collusion with political actors in the Western world. While the themes of the &quot;War against Islam&quot; mostly concern general issues of societal transformations in modernization and secularization as well as current international power politics, the Crusades are often given as its starting point.

The phrase or similar phrases have been used by Islamists such as Sayyid Qutb, Ayatollah Khomeini, Anwar al-Awlaki, Osama bin Laden, Chechen militant Dokka Umarov, cleric Anjem Choudary, and Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan. It has also been used in propaganda by al-Qaida and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The English-language political neologism of &quot;War on Islam&quot; was coined in Islamist discourse in the 1990s and popularized as a conspiracy theory only after 2001.

Jonathan Schanzer has argued that the historical Muslim indifference to the West turned to &quot;alarmed dislike&quot; with the beginning of Western military superiority in the 17th century. However, with the end of the era of Western colonialism, rage against non-Muslims and the governments of Muslim-majority countries stems not from alleged non-Muslim aggression and enmity, but allegedly from frustration over the unrelenting encroachment of mostly Western culture, technology, economies, and from a yearning for a &quot;return to the glorious days when Islam reigned supreme.&quot;

==Usage of the term and concept==

The most influential Islamists who have alleged a broad malicious conspiracy against the societal system of Islam are:

===Sayyid Qutb===

From the background of the Muslim Brotherhood organization and ideology, Sayyid Qutb, possibly the most influential Islamist author, often described as &quot;the man whose ideas would shape Al Qaeda&quot;, also preached that the West was not just in conflict with Islam but plotting against it. In his book &quot;Milestones&quot;, first published in 1964, he wrote:

&quot;The Western ways of thought … [have] an enmity toward all religion, and in particular with greater hostility toward Islam. This enmity toward Islam is especially pronounced and many times is the result of a well-thought-out scheme the object of which is first to shake the foundations of Islamic beliefs and then gradually to demolish the structure of Muslim society.&quot;

Olivier Roy has described Qutb&#x27;s attitude as one of &quot;radical contempt and hatred&quot; for the West, and complains that the propensity of Muslims like Qutb to blame problems on outside conspiracies &quot;is currently paralyzing Muslim political thought. For to say that every failure is the devil&#x27;s work is the same as asking God, or the devil himself (which is to say these days the Americans), to solve one&#x27;s problems.&quot;

Among the early books following Qutb is &quot;Qadat al-gharb yaquluman: dammiru al-Islam, ubidu ahlahu&quot; (&quot;Western Leaders Are Saying: Destroy Islam, Annihilate All of Its People&quot;) written by Jalal `Alam and published in 1977.

===Ayatollah Khomeini===
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shia Islamist leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, preached that Western imperialists or neoimperialists sought to make Muslims suffer, to &quot;plunder&quot; their resources and other wealth, and had to undermine Islam first because Islam stood in the way of this stealing and immiseration. Khomeini claims some of the alleged Western plots being not recent but hundreds of years old.

&quot;[Europeans] have known the power of Islam themselves for it once ruled part of Europe, and they know that true Islam is opposed to their activities. (...) From the very outset, therefore, they have sought to remove this obstacle from their path by disparaging Islam (...). They have resorted to malicious propaganda (...).&quot; &quot;The agents of imperialism are busy in every corner of the Islamic world drawing our youth away from us with their evil propaganda.&quot; &quot;They are destroying Islam! Agents – both foreigners sent by the imperialists and natives employed by them – have spread out into every village and region of Iran and are leading our children and young people astray.&quot;

===Osama bin Laden===
From a Salafist perspective, Osama bin Laden emphasizes the alleged war and urges Muslims to take arms against it in almost all of his written or recorded messages. In his 1998 fatwa where he declared the killing of &quot;Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it,&quot; bin Laden listed three reasons for the fatwa: the presence of US troops in Saudi Arabia, the increase in infant mortality in Iraq following US-supported sanctions there, and US aid to Israel.

&quot;All these crimes and sins committed by the Americans are a clear declaration of war on Allah, his messenger, and Muslims. What bears no doubt in this fierce Judeo-Christian campaign against the Muslim world, the likes of which has never been seen before, is that the Muslims must prepare all possible might to repel the enemy (...).&quot; &quot;Every day, from east to west, our umma of 1200 million Muslims is being slaughtered (...)&quot; &quot;We (...) see events not as isolated incidents, but as part of a long chain of conspiracies, a war of annihilation (...).&quot; &quot;The West (...) will not be able to respect others&#x27; beliefs or feelings. (...) They regard jihad for the sake of God or defending one&#x27;s self or his country as an act of terror.&quot;

==Allegations relating to the supposed war against Islam==
===Islamic tradition and history===
According to scholar David B. Cook, a religious studies professor at Rice University, what some believe is scriptural evidence for the existence of the alleged &quot;War against Islam&quot; is found in a popular hadith, one that supposedly prophesies a war against Islam is the &quot;Tradition of Thawban&quot;:
&quot;The Messenger of God said: The nations are about to flock against you [the Muslims] from every horizon, just as hungry people flock to a kettle. We said: O Messenger of God, will we be few on that day? He said: No, you will be many in number, but you will be scum, like the scum of a flash-flood, without any weight, since fear will be removed from the hearts of your enemies, and weakness (&quot;wahn&quot;) will be placed in your hearts. We said: O Messenger of God, what does the word &quot;wahn&quot; mean? He said: Love of this world, and fear of death.&quot;
Cook claims that the idea of a Western war against the societal system of Islam is a belief &quot;at the heart of the radical Muslim and especially the globalist radical Muslim;&quot; a factor &quot;binding globalist radical Muslims together.&quot; A factor that &quot;connects the stupidity of extremist Muslims who interfere in world affairs to listen to the words of a person claiming to be a liar under the pretext of Islam, otherwise Islam itself does not have any such offensive statements.&quot;

Western supporters of the belief in ingrained Western hatred of – or hostility towards – Islam include historian Roger Savory, and Boston-based novelist and author James Carroll. According to Savory, Christendom felt threatened by Islam and its march into Europe (the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate advanced into Europe as far as northern France before being defeated at the Battle of Tours in 732; the Muslim Ottoman Empire attempted to conquer Vienna twice, laying siege to the city in 1529 and 1683), and thus became hostile to it. Therefore, the domineering actions of the kings of the time were blamed on Islam and forced Christianity to be at enmity with Islam, even though both of them were divine religions and introduced a way to live in peace, and were in harmony and development with each other.

===Alleged legacy of the Crusades===
Islamists who use this term often point to the Crusades and European colonization, believing it to be an example of an attempt to destroy the Muslim way of life. Sayyid Qutb, for example, not only believed the West had &quot;a well-thought-out scheme the object of which is first to shake the foundations of Islamic beliefs,&quot; but maintained that the medieval Christian Crusades were not &quot;a form of imperialism,&quot; but rather Western imperialism was a new form of the Crusades, &quot;latter-day&quot; imperialism in Muslim lands being &quot;but a mask for the crusading spirit.&quot; Savory says: &quot;It is not surprising, therefore, to find a great similarity between the medieval view that it was safe to speak ill of Muhammad because his malignity exceeded whatever ill could be spoken of him, and the tone of nineteenth-century missionary tracts which exhorted the Muslims in India to abandon the false religion which they had been taught. There were even echos of the old crusading spirit. When the French occupied Algeria in 1830, they declared that they had in mind &#x27;the greatest benefit to Christendom&#x27;. Similarly, Canning&#x27;s solution to the &#x27;problem&#x27; of the Ottoman empire was to bring it into modern Europe under Christian tutelage. When the French invaded Tunis in 1881, they considered their action a sacred duty &#x27;which a superior civilisation owes to the populations which are less advanced&#x27;.&quot;
On September 16, 2001, President George W. Bush referred to the war in Afghanistan as a Crusade: &quot;This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while. And the American people must be patient. I&#x27;m going to be patient.&quot; 

In contrast, historian Bernard Lewis points out that the Crusaders had strong motives to wage the Crusade other than the denigration of Islam. The lands they attempted to recover were the lands where Christianity was founded, including &quot;the holy land where Christ had lived, taught and died&quot;, and where &quot;a substantial proportion of the population ... perhaps even a majority, was still Christian&quot;, since &quot;not much more than four centuries had passed since the Arab Muslim conquerors had wrested these lands from Christendom&quot;. Rather than the Crusades leaving a psychological scar passed down through the ages among Muslims, the Arabs of the time did not refer to the Crusaders as Crusaders or Christians but as Franks or Infidels, and &quot;with few exceptions&quot;, the Muslim historians of the time showed &quot;little interest in whence or why the Franks had come, and report their arrival and their departure with equal lack of curiosity&quot;.

===Modern-day events===
The alleged perpetrators of the &quot;War on Islam&quot; include Western powers (especially the United States), pro-Western Muslim regimes (e.g. Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Pakistan) and non-Western, non-Muslim states such as Israel (Israeli–Palestinian conflict), Myanmar (Rohingya genocide), Serbia (Bosnian Genocide), Russia (Chechen–Russian conflict), India (for the conflict in Kashmir), and more recently China (for the Xinjiang conflict). Osama bin Laden mentions: &quot;Meanwhile, a UN resolution passed more than half a century ago gave Muslim Kashmir the liberty of choosing independence from India and Kashmir. George Bush, the leader of the Crusaders&#x27; campaign, announced a few days ago that he will order his converted agent [Pakistan President Pervez] Musharraf to shut down the Kashmir mujahidin camps, thus affirming that it is a Zionist-Hindu war against Muslims.&quot;

In particular, Western support for the continued occupation of Palestine territory by the State of Israel has been declared part of a &quot;war against Islam.&quot; Osama bin Laden declared that &quot;the West&#x27;s rejection of the fairly elected Hamas government is a reaffirmation of the &#x27;injustice, aggression, and rancor&#x27; against Palestinians.&quot; Enver Masud, an Indian Muslim and author of the book &quot;The War on Islam&quot; stated that while there are no Muslims in high-level policy making and media jobs in the United States, &quot;Jewish Americans occupy nearly every single position relating to US Arab-Israeli policy.&quot; India&#x27;s control of Muslim-majority Kashmir has been called a &quot;Zionist-Hindu war against Muslims&quot; by Osama bin Laden. In modern day, events alleged to be attacks on Islam include media portrayal of the religion itself and &quot;the War on Terror&quot;. Alleged conspiracies against Islam sometimes involve other Muslims who are accused of being apostates. The Ayatollah Khomeini believed that &quot;agents of imperialism&quot;, the term he gave to &quot;secular&quot; pro-Western Muslims, were &quot;busy in every corner of the Islamic world drawing our youth away from us with their evil propaganda.&quot;

In 2016, the US National Security Adviser said: &quot;We are facing another ‘ism,’ just like we faced Nazism, and fascism, and imperialism and communism. This is Islamism, it is a vicious cancer inside the body of 1.7 billion people on this planet and it has to be excised.&quot;.

The 2005 Danish cartoon controversy were satirical cartoons depicting Muhammad in a Danish newspaper that led to protests and the burning of the Norwegian and Danish embassies in Syria, and were seen by Osama bin Laden as part of the &quot;Zionist-crusaders war on Islam&quot;.
In an audio message, Osama bin Laden described the cartoons as taking place in the framework of a &quot;new Crusade&quot; against Islam, in which he said the pope has played a &quot;large and lengthy role&quot; and asserted &quot;you went overboard in your unbelief and freed yourselves of the etiquettes of dispute and fighting and went to the extent of publishing these insulting drawings.&quot; &quot;This is the greater and more serious tragedy (than bombing Muslim villagers), and reckoning for it will be more severe.&quot; Among others, Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed a &quot;Zionist conspiracy&quot; for the row over the cartoons. The Palestinian envoy to Washington D.C. alleged the Likud party concocted distribution of Muhammad caricatures worldwide in a bid to create a clash between the West and the Muslim world. After the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a Jordanian commentator writing for the Jordanian newspaper, Al-Dustour, claimed that Al-Baghdadi had been an Israeli agent, who had been trained by the Israeli foreign intelligence service, the Mossad, for a mission to tarnish the image of Islam.

====Media====
The Universities of Georgia and Alabama in the United States conducted a study comparing media coverage of &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; committed by Islamist militants with those of non-Muslims in the United States. Researchers found that &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; by Islamist militants receive 357% more media attention than attacks committed by non-Muslims or whites. Terrorist attacks committed by non-Muslims (or where the religion was unknown) received an average of 15 headlines, while those committed by Muslim extremists received 105 headlines. The study was based on an analysis of news reports covering terrorist attacks in the United States between 2005 and 2015.

==Reception==
Reactions in the non-Muslim West to the alleged war have varied. Some Western political leaders have dismissed the claims of a war being fought against Islam as untrue, while also being sensitive to Muslim fears of such a &quot;war&quot; and shaping some of their political statements and actions with Muslim fears in mind—including denouncing those who verbally attack Muslims. Other non-Muslims have argued that the truth of a religious war is the other way around—it being Muslims who are waging war against non-Muslims.

===Reception in American politics===
Following Islamist terrorist attacks both President Barack Obama (following the San Bernardino attack) and George W. Bush (after the 9/11 attacks) made a point of stating that the US was not at war with Islam, instead saying that they were at &quot;war against evil&quot; (Bush) and &quot;people who have perverted Islam&quot; (Obama).

When Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stated that foreign Muslims should not be allowed to enter into the United States, until the administration can figure out what is going on, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham replied that &quot;Donald Trump has done the one single thing you cannot do — declare war on Islam itself. To all of our Muslim friends throughout the world, like the king of Jordan and the president of Egypt, I am sorry. He does not represent us.&quot; Another reaction was that of the &quot;Washington Blade&quot;, a gay newspaper, which printed a full-page headline stating: &quot;To All Muslims: Trump Does Not Speak For Us.&quot; White House Chief Strategist, Steve Bannon, has also been accused of inciting a war against Islam, and has accused Muslims of being a &quot;fifth column here in the United States that needs to be dealt with immediately&quot;, and has called Islam &quot;a religion of submission&quot;, in contrast with the &quot;enlightened ... Judeo-Christian West&quot;.

Madiha Afzal of the Brookings Institution wrote in August 2016 that Trump&#x27;s allegations of an Islamic war on America were helping ISIS convince Muslims that America is at war with Islam.

===Reception in Muslim discourse===
A measure of the strength of the belief that a non-Muslim power (the United States) is at least attempting to weaken, if not annihilate, Islam can be found in opinion polls that showed, as of late 2006 and early 2007, strong majorities — at least 70% — in the Muslim countries of Egypt, Morocco, Pakistan, and Indonesia, answering &quot;yes&quot; to the pollsters&#x27; question: do you believe the United States seeks to &quot;weaken and divide the Islamic world?&quot;

Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon write in their book &quot;Age of Sacred Terror&quot;:

In the Middle East and Pakistan, religious discourse dominates societies, the airwaves, and thinking about the world. Radical mosques have proliferated throughout Egypt. Bookstores are dominated by works with religious themes … The demand for sharia, the belief that their governments are unfaithful to Islam and that Islam is the answer to all problems, and &quot;the certainty that the West has declared war on Islam&quot;; these are the themes that dominate public discussion. Islamists may not control parliaments or government palaces, but they have occupied the popular imagination.

The idea that the West is waging war on Islam has however been dismissed by many non-Muslims in the west. Salman Rushdie, victim of a Fatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini calling for his death, has argued that what Islamists have called a war of &quot;the west versus Islam&quot; is more complicated. Islamists are &quot;opposed not only to the west and &#x27;the Jews&#x27; but to their fellow Islamists&quot;, an example being the fight between the Sunni Taliban and the Shia Islamic Republic of Iran. &quot;This paranoid Islam, which blames outsiders, &#x27;infidels&#x27;, for all the ills of Muslim societies and whose proposed remedy is the closing of those societies to the rival project of modernity, is presently the fastest-growing version of Islam in the world,&quot; according to Rushdie.

===Western proponents of the &quot;War against Islam&quot; theory===
According to James Carroll, the conflict between Muslims and Westerners &quot;has its origins more in &#x27;the West&#x27; than in the House of Islam&quot;, and can be traced to &quot;the poison flower of the Crusades, with their denigrations of distant cultures&quot;, and other Western injustices. Proponents of this view often consider the War on Terrorism with the accompanying 2001 military activity in Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq to be part of the war against Islam. Western colonialism in the Middle East throughout the 20th century is also regarded as such an attack by some.

<text>William Miller (February 15, 1782 – December 20, 1849) was an American clergyman who is credited with beginning the mid-19th-century North American religious movement known as Millerism. After his proclamation of the Second Coming did not occur as expected in the 1840s, new heirs of his message emerged, including the Advent Christians (1860), the Seventh-day Adventists (1863) and other Adventist movements.

== Early life ==
William Miller was born on February 15, 1782, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. His parents were Captain William Miller, a veteran of the American Revolution, and Paulina, the daughter of Elnathan Phelps. When he was four years old, his family moved to rural Low Hampton, New York. Miller was educated at home by his mother until the age of nine, when he attended the newly established East Poultney District School. Miller is not known to have undertaken any type of formal study after the age of eighteen, though he continued to read widely and voraciously. As a youth, he had access to the private libraries of Judge James Witherell and Congressman Matthew Lyon in nearby Fair Haven, Vermont, as well as that of Alexander Cruikshanks of Whitehall, New York.
In 1803, Miller married Lucy Smith and moved to her nearby hometown of Poultney, where he took up farming. While in Poultney, Miller was elected to a number of civil offices, starting with the office of Constable. In 1809 he was elected to the office of Deputy Sheriff and at an unknown date was elected Justice of the Peace. Miller served in the Vermont militia and was commissioned a lieutenant on July 21, 1810. He was reasonably well off, owning a house, land, and at least two horses.

Shortly after his move to Poultney, Miller rejected his Baptist heritage and became a Deist. In his biography Miller records his conversion: &quot;I became acquainted with the principal men in that village [Poultney, Vermont], who were professedly Deists; but they were good citizens, and of a moral and serious deportment. They put into my hands the works of Voltaire, [David] Hume, Thomas Paine, Ethan Allen, and other deistical writers.&quot;

== Military service ==
At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Miller raised a company of local men and traveled to Burlington, Vermont. He transferred to the 30th Infantry Regiment in the regular army of the United States with the rank of lieutenant. Miller spent most of the war working as a recruiter and on February 1, 1814, he was promoted to captain. He saw his first action at the Battle of Plattsburgh, where vastly outnumbered American forces overcame the British. &quot;The fort I was in was exposed to every shot. Bombs, rockets, and shrapnel shells fell as thick as hailstones&quot;, he said. One of these many shots had exploded two feet from him, wounding three of his men and killing another, but Miller survived without a scratch. Miller came to view the outcome of this battle as miraculous, and therefore at odds with his deistic view of a distant God far removed from human affairs. He later wrote, &quot;It seemed to me that the Supreme Being must have watched over the interests of this country in an especial manner, and delivered us from the hands of our enemies... So surprising a result, against such odds, did seem to me like the work of a mightier power than man.&quot;

== Religious life ==
After the war, and following his discharge from the army on June 18, 1815, Miller returned to Poultney. Shortly after his return he moved with his family back to Low Hampton, where he purchased a farm (now a historic site operated by Adventist Heritage Ministry). Throughout this time period Miller was deeply concerned with the question of death and an afterlife. This reflection upon his own mortality followed his experiences as a soldier in the war, but also the recent deaths of his father and sister. Miller apparently felt that there were only two options possible following death: annihilation, and accountability; neither of which he was comfortable with.

Soon after his return to Low Hampton, Miller took tentative steps towards regaining his Baptist faith. At first he attempted to combine both, publicly espousing Deism while simultaneously attending his local Baptist church. His attendance turned to participation when he was asked to read the day&#x27;s sermon during one of the local minister&#x27;s frequent absences. His participation changed to commitment one Sunday when he was reading a sermon on the duties of parents and became choked with emotion. Miller records the experience:

Suddenly the character of a Savior was vividly impressed upon my mind. It seemed that there might be a Being so good and compassionate as to Himself atone for our transgressions, and thereby save us from suffering the penalty of sin. I immediately felt how lovely such a Being must be; and imagined that I could cast myself into the arms of, and trust in the mercy of, such a One.

Following his conversion, Miller&#x27;s Deist friends soon challenged him to justify his newfound faith. He did so by examining the Bible closely, declaring to one friend &quot;If he would give me time, I would harmonize all these apparent contradictions to my own satisfaction, or I will be a Deist still.&quot; Miller commenced with Genesis 1:1, studying each verse and not moving on until he felt the meaning was clear. In this way he became convinced firstly, that postmillennialism was unbiblical; and secondly, that the time of Christ&#x27;s Second Coming was revealed in Bible prophecy.


Basing his calculations principally on Daniel 8:14: &quot;Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed&quot;, Miller assumed that the &quot;cleansing of the sanctuary&quot; represented the Earth&#x27;s purification by fire at Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. Then, using the interpretive principle of the &quot;day-year principle&quot;, Miller (and others) interpreted a &quot;day in prophecy&quot; to read not as a 24-hour period, but rather as a calendar year. Further, Miller became convinced that the 2,300 day period started in 457 BC with the decree to rebuild Jerusalem by Artaxerxes I of Persia. Simple calculation then revealed that this period would end in 1843. Miller records, &quot;I was thus brought... to the solemn conclusion, that in about twenty-five years from that time 1818 all the affairs of our present state would be wound up.&quot;

Although Miller was convinced of his calculations by 1818, he continued to study privately until 1823 to ensure the correctness of his interpretation. In September 1822, Miller formally stated his conclusions in a twenty-point document, including article 15: &quot;I believe that the second coming of Jesus Christ is near, even at the door, even within twenty-one years, – on or before 1843.&quot; Miller did not, however, begin his public lecturing until the first Sunday in August 1831 in the town of Dresden.

In 1832 Miller submitted a series of sixteen articles to the &quot;Vermont Telegraph&quot;, a Baptist newspaper. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; published the first of these on May 15, and Miller writes of the public&#x27;s response: &quot;I began to be flooded with letters of inquiry respecting my views; and visitors flocked to converse with me on the subject.&quot; In 1834, unable to personally comply with many of the urgent requests for information and the invitations to travel and preach that he received, Miller published a synopsis of his teachings in a 64-page tract with the lengthy title: &quot;Evidence from Scripture and History of the Second Coming of Christ, about the Year 1844: Exhibited in a Course of Lectures.&quot;

== Miller and Freemasonry ==
Miller was an active Freemason until 1831. Miller resigned his Masonic membership in 1831, stating that he did so to &quot;avoid fellowship with any practice that may be incompatible with the word of God among masons.&quot; By 1833 he wrote in a letter to his friends to treat Freemasonry &quot;as they would any other evil&quot;.

== Millerism ==

From 1840 onwards, Millerism was transformed from an &quot;obscure, regional movement into a national campaign.&quot; The key figure in this transformation was Joshua Vaughan Himes, the pastor of Chardon Street Chapel in Boston, Massachusetts, and an able and experienced publisher. Though Himes did not fully accept Miller&#x27;s ideas until 1842, he established the fortnightly paper &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; on February 28, 1840, to publicize them.

Despite the urging of his supporters, Miller never personally set an exact date for the expected Second Advent. However, in response to their urgings, he did narrow the time-period to sometime in the Jewish year beginning in the Gregorian year 1843, stating: &quot;My principles in brief, are, that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844.&quot; March 21, 1844, passed without incident, and further discussion and study resulted in the brief adoption of a new date (April 18, 1844) based on the Karaite calendar (as opposed to the Rabbinic calendar). Like the previous date, April 18 passed without Christ&#x27;s return. Miller responded publicly, writing, &quot;I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment; yet I still believe that the day of the Lord is near, even at the door.&quot;

In August 1844 at a camp-meeting in Exeter, New Hampshire, Samuel S. Snow presented a message that became known as the &quot;seventh-month&quot; message or the &quot;true midnight cry.&quot; In a discussion based on scriptural typology, Snow presented his conclusion (still based on the 2300 day prophecy in Daniel 8:14), that Christ would return on, &quot;the tenth day of the seventh month of the present year, 1844.&quot; Again, based largely on the calendar of the Karaite Jews, this date was determined to be October 22, 1844.

== The Great Disappointment ==

After the failure of Miller&#x27;s expectations for October 22, 1844, the date became known as the Millerites&#x27; Great Disappointment. Hiram Edson recorded that &quot;Our fondest hopes and expectations were blasted, and such a spirit of weeping came over us as I never experienced before... We wept, and wept, till the day dawn.&quot; 

Following the Great Disappointment most Millerites simply gave up their beliefs. Some did not and viewpoints and explanations proliferated. Miller initially seems to have thought that Christ&#x27;s Second Coming was still going to take place—that &quot;the year of expectation was according to prophecy; but...that there might be an error in Bible chronology, which was of human origin, that could throw the date off somewhat and account for the discrepancy.&quot; Miller never gave up his belief in the Second Coming of Christ. 

Estimates of Miller&#x27;s followers—the Millerites—vary between 50,000, and 500,000. Miller&#x27;s legacy includes the Advent Christian Church with 61,000 members, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church with over 19 million members. Both these denominations have a direct connection with the Millerites and the Great Disappointment of 1844. A number of other individuals with ties to the Millerites founded various short-lived groups. These include Clorinda S. Minor, who led a group of seven to Palestine to prepare for Christ&#x27;s second coming at a later date.
Miller died on December 20, 1849, still convinced that the Second Coming was imminent. He is buried near his home in Low Hampton, NY and his home is a registered National Historic Landmark and preserved as a museum: William Miller&#x27;s Home.

The papers of William Miller are preserved in the archives at Aurora University. Other papers by Miller can be located at the archives at Andrews University and Loma Linda University. In addition some historical documents were found in Miller&#x27;s home when his home was purchased by Adventist Heritage Ministry as a historic property in 1983, and are housed in the Ellen G. White Estate vault in Silver Spring, Maryland.

The standard biography of William Miller is &quot;Memoirs of William Miller&quot; by Sylvester Bliss (Boston: Joshua V. Himes, 1853). It was republished with a critical introduction by Andrews University Press in 2006. Other helpful treatments include F. D. Nichol, &quot;The Midnight Cry&quot; and Clyde Hewitt, &quot;Midnight and Morning&quot;.

David L. Rowe published &quot;God&#x27;s Strange Work: William Miller and the End of the World&quot; (Eerdmans: 2008), as part of the Library of Religious Biography series. One reviewer described it as a &quot;keen historical and cultural analysis.&quot;

<text>Peter Stent (c. 1613–1665) was a seventeenth-century London printseller, who from the early 1640s until his death ran one of the biggest printmaking businesses of the day.

Stent originally was an engraver himself. Edward Calver wrote verses to a set of Stent&#x27;s plates from 1635. He then sold works of other artists, such as John Dunstall, John Fillian, Richard Gaywood, and George Glover. He also recycled plates he had acquired, in new printings: for example of the penmanship of Martin Billingsley, by George Gifford, from Sir Robert Peake and Thomas Rowlett via Thomas Hinde.

Stent died in the Great Plague of London. His business was taken over by John Overton.

<text>The Asian dowitcher (Limnodromus semipalmatus) is a rare medium-large wader.

==Description==
Adults have dark legs and a long straight dark bill, somewhat shorter than that of the long-billed dowitcher. The body is brown on top and reddish underneath in breeding plumage. The tail has a black and white barred pattern. The winter plumage is largely grey.

Their breeding habitat is grassy wetlands in inland Siberia and Manchuria. They migrate to southeast Asia as far south as northern Australia, although both the breeding and wintering areas are poorly known. This bird is always found on coasts during migration and wintering.

These birds forage by probing in shallow water or on wet mud. They mainly eat insects, mollusks, crustaceans and marine worms, but also eat some plant material.

==Closer species==
The confusion species for this bird is not, as might be expected, one of the American dowitchers, which in any case do not overlap in range, because the Asian bird is much larger. It closely resembles a small bar-tailed godwit, although the dowitcher &quot;sewing machine&quot; feeding action and the yelping call are distinctions from the more widespread bird.

<text>William Bruce Cameron (born July 25, 1956) is an American author, columnist, and humorist. Cameron is most famous for his novel &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Purpose&quot;, which spent 52 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. The book is the basis for the movie version starring Dennis Quaid, Britt Robertson, Peggy Lipton, K.J. Apa, Juliet Rylance, Luke Kirby, John Ortiz, and Pooch Hall, and released in theaters on January 27, 2017. &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Purpose&quot; is followed by a sequel called &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which Cameron, along with Cathryn Michon, adapted into a film of the same name.

His books have been translated into over 60 languages.

==Life and career==
Cameron was born in Petoskey, Michigan. He is also the author of the best-selling self-improvement book &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot;, which was later adapted into the ABC sitcom of the same name that aired from 2002 to 2005. His book &quot;8 Simple Rules for Marrying My Daughter&quot; was released in 2008 and already had a Hollywood movie deal before its publication, with 89 Films and Wendy Finerman, producer of &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;.

Cameron is also the author of &quot;How to Remodel a Man&quot;, which was excerpted in the August 2005 issue of &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot;, and was the subject of the November 1, 2005 &quot;Oprah Show&quot;. His novel, &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Purpose&quot;, was published in July 2010 by Tom Doherty Associates. It was 19 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in its hardcover release. The softcover version was released on May 24, 2011. In total, &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Purpose&quot; has spent a year on &quot; The New York Times&quot; Bestseller list (hardcover and paperback combined).

He wrote a weekly column for Creators Syndicate from 2001 until 2015 that appeared in around 50 newspapers in the U.S. and Canada, including Hawaii&#x27;s &quot;MidWeek&quot;; &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; told his humorous cautionary tales and memories of his life and was named after his bestselling book. In 2012, overwhelmed with other work, Cameron put it on hold after 689 editions.

Cameron&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;A Dog’s Way Home&quot; inspired the 2019 film of the same name.

The 2012 sequel to &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Purpose&quot;, entitled &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Journey,&quot; was adapted by Cameron and his wife, Cathryn Michon, into a film of the same name, directed by Gail Mancuso.

<text>Mastermind is a British television quiz show for the BBC, currently presented by Clive Myrie. Its creator, Bill Wright, drew inspiration from his experiences of being interrogated by the Gestapo during World War II. The show features an intimidating setting and challenging questions. Four (and in later contests five or six) contestants face two rounds, one on a specialised subject of the contestant&#x27;s choice, the other a general knowledge round.

&quot;Mastermind&quot;″s theme music is &quot;Approaching Menace&quot; by the British composer Neil Richardson. The show was recorded, with original presenter Magnus Magnusson, on location at UK universities. Later, it was recorded in Manchester at studios such as New Broadcasting House and Granada Studios, before moving to dock10 studios in 2011. The show relocated to Belfast for the 2019–2020 series.

==Format==

=== Round 1 ===
For the first round, each contestant in turn is given a set length of time, usually two minutes (one minute and a half in semi-finals), to answer questions on a specialised subject which they have chosen. The contestant scores one point for each correct answer and may pass as often as desired. The contestant is not permitted to interrupt the host and give the correct answer while the question is being read out.

If the contestant responds incorrectly, the questioner gives the correct answer before continuing to the next question; answers to passed questions are read out only after time has expired. In early series, the score and time were kept by Mary Craig who sat next to Magnusson.

If time runs out while a question is being read, the questioner will finish it and give the contestant a few seconds to answer. This has led to the programme&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;I&#x27;ve started so I&#x27;ll finish.&quot; If a question has been read out in full when time expires, but the contestants have not yet given an answer, they are allowed a few seconds to do so. The contestant&#x27;s score is displayed on screen; beginning with the 2016–17 series, the border around the score gradually turns blue (black in the 2019–20 series) during the final 10 seconds.

=== Round 2 ===
During the second round, each contestant in turn answers a series of general knowledge questions. The rules from the first round apply, except that the time limit is extended (usually two and a half minutes since 2010, or two minutes in semi-finals and until 2010). Originally, the contestants played in the same order as in the first round; currently, they play in ascending order by first-round score.

The winner is the contestant with the highest total score after two rounds. Ties are broken in favour of the contestant with the fewest total passes. If contestants have the same score and number of passes, a five-question tiebreaker is played. Each of the tied contestants answers the same set of questions individually, with the others exiting the studio so that they cannot hear the results. The contestant who gives the most correct answers is the winner.

The winners advance to the next round, for which they must choose a different specialised subject. In the early years of the programme, finalists were allowed to reuse their first-round subjects in the grand final. However, from 1992 onwards, the finalists are required to choose a third subject. The winner of the final of the BBC version is declared &quot;Mastermind&quot; for that year and is the only contestant to receive a prize, in the form of a cut glass engraved bowl. During Magnus Magnusson&#x27;s tenure as presenter, the trophy was specially manufactured by Caithness Glass. A special guest would always be invited to present the trophy to the winner, with the exception of the final edition in 1997, in which Magnusson presented it himself. Every trophy used by the main series has been made by Scottish artist Denis Mann.

==Versions==
&quot;Mastermind&quot; (1972 to 1997), presented by Magnus Magnusson, aired on BBC1. It was originally broadcast late on a Monday night and was not expected to receive a huge audience. In 1973 it was moved to a prime-time slot as an emergency replacement for a Leslie Phillips sitcom, &quot;Casanova &#x27;73&quot;, which had been moved to a later time following complaints about its risqué content. The quiz subsequently became one of the most-watched shows on British television. Magnusson&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;ve started, so I&#x27;ll finish&quot; was also the title of his history of the show. The original series was filmed in academic or ecclesiastical buildings. The last programme of the original series was filmed at St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney.

The original series spawned many specials:
* &quot;Supermind&quot; was an annual playoff between either the first four champions of &quot;Mastermind&quot; or champions of other TV quiz shows (including &quot;Mastermind&quot;) from 1976 or 1977. It ran for three years between 1976 and 1978. 
* &quot;Cup Final Mastermind&quot; was an annual playoff between experts and supporters from the FA Cup Finalist teams they are supporting. It ran from 1978 and 1980. 
* &quot;Mastermind International&quot; was an annual playoff between winners of various international versions of the show (or the nearest equivalents in some countries) and ran for five years between 1979 and 1983. 
* &quot;Mastermind Champions&quot; was a 1982 3-part competition where the first ten champions of the show compete to become the &quot;Mastermind&quot; Champion of Champions.

BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Mastermind&quot; (1998 and 2000) was hosted by Peter Snow.

Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mastermind&quot; (2001) was hosted by Clive Anderson. The commercials shortened the amount of time available for answering questions and lasted just one series. This was also the first to go &quot;interactive&quot;. By using the red button viewers could play the general knowledge section throughout the series. These questions had been written specifically to afford both standard and multiple-choice format in presentation. There was a one-off competition between the four highest scoring viewers.

In 2003, the current BBC Two version premiered, hosted by John Humphrys. Whereas the original series had kept talk to a minimum (asking contestants only their name, occupation and specialist subject), the new run had at first included some conversational elements with contestants, at the start of the General Knowledge round (normally about the contestant&#x27;s specialist subject). But these have been dropped since the 2011 series. Instead, there is now a brief monologue from the winner at the end of each episode about how pleased they are to have won. There is no discussion with the other contestants. It is also distinguished from the original BBC TV series because many more of the specialist subjects come from popular culture. This probably reflects cultural changes in the British middle classes in recent years. Unlike the original version, this version is studio-based. It is now made in MediaCity in Salford. However, due to asbestos being found at Granada&#x27;s Manchester studios parts of the 2006 series were filmed at Yorkshire Television&#x27;s Leeds studios). 
* In 2008 there was a 10-part competition this time entitled &quot;Sport Mastermind&quot;, hosted by Des Lynam. 
* &quot;Mastermind Champion of Champions&quot; was a 2010 5-part competition that featured previous &quot;Mastermind&quot; champions. 
* &quot;Junior Mastermind&quot;, also hosted by John Humphrys, is a children&#x27;s version of the quiz programme and has the same format, the difference being that the contestants are only ten and eleven years old. The programme aired across six nights on BBC One, ending on 4 September 2004. The winner was Daniel Parker, whose specialist subjects were the Volkswagen Beetle (heat) and James Bond villains (final). There was another series in 2005 (subjects included Black Holes and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy), which was won by Robin Geddes, whose specialist subjects were &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; and &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, with a third series airing in 2006, won by Domnhall Ryan, and featuring subjects such as Harry Potter and Chelsea Football Club, and a fourth series in 2007 won by Robert Stutter and a fifth series later that year won by David Verghese. The Junior version was cancelled after the two 2007 series.
In February 2021, Humphrys announced that after eighteen years at the helm of the show, he would leave the show. On 22 March 2021, it was announced that Clive Myrie would take over as host. Myrie made his debut on 23 August 2021.

In the United States, the game show &quot;2 Minute Drill&quot; on sports network ESPN had its roots in &quot;Mastermind&quot; when Michael Davies and Andrew J. Golder attempted to develop a U.S. version of &quot;Mastermind&quot; for ABC. Contestants faced questions fired at them by a panel of four sports and entertainment celebrities for two minutes; like &quot;Mastermind&quot;, there were two rounds of questions, but the first round had each panellist&#x27;s questions representing a different sports category pertaining to their area of expertise, and the second round had no categories and the contestant could not control who asked the questions; they were fired at random. The contestant with the highest score after two rounds would win a cash prize, and would have a chance to double those winnings by correctly answering the untimed &quot;Question of Great Significance,&quot; as host Kenny Mayne called it, from a speciality category chosen by the winner (usually a particular athlete or sports team from the past). In each series, winners advanced in a bracket-style playoff format, with cash prizes increasing from $5,000 in the first round to $50,000 (doubling to $10,000–$100,000 by answering the final question) in the final round. Prizes such as trips to the Super Bowl or ESPY Awards were also given, known as &quot;ESPN Experiences&quot;. The show had three series over a 15-month period, from September 2000 to December 2001. Like &quot;Mastermind&quot;, &quot;2 Minute Drill&quot; featured a leather chair, dramatic lighting and sound effects. Willy Gibson of Columbus, Ohio, was the grand champion of the first two series; he was defeated in the second round of the third and final series.

==Records==

===Highest scores===
The highest overall &quot;Mastermind&quot; score is 41 points, set by Kevin Ashman in 1995, his specialist subject being &quot;The Life of Martin Luther King Jr.&quot; Ashman went on to become six times IQA world champion. In addition he holds the record for the highest ever score on &quot;Brain of Britain&quot; and has been a member of the &quot;Eggheads&quot; since that series debut.

In August 2010 during an edition of &quot;Mastermind Champion of Champions&quot;, the 2010 series champion, Jesse Honey, scored 23 out of 23 on &quot;Flags of the World&quot; in the specialist subject round, an all-time record. He finished as runner-up with a combined score of 36 points, losing out to Pat Gibson by having two more passes. Honey&#x27;s score was equalled by Iwan Thomas, who scored a record 23 (in two-and-a-half minutes) in the general knowledge round in 2010.

On &quot;Junior Mastermind&quot; in February 2007, an 11-year-old schoolboy called Callum scored 19 points on his specialist subject, cricketer Andrew Flintoff. However, he did not win, being beaten by one point after achieving a final score of 32.

===Lowest scores===
The current record for the lowest score in the specialist subject round is jointly held by Troy Deeney and Dana on 22 December 2023, Harry Pinero on 2 February 2024 and Aaron Evans on 16 February 2024, all of whom scored no points when answering questions on the Sam Raimi trilogy of Spider-Man films, UK hit singles of 1969–76, Lewis Hamilton and cephalopods respectively.

The current record for the overall lowest score is 2 points, set on 5 November 2022 in a Celebrity edition by &quot;Gogglebox&quot;&#x27;s Amy Tapper who scored two points overall; one on her specialist subject of the films of Adam Sandler and another in the general knowledge round.

Prior to these, the record for the overall lowest score was five points, set on 29 January 2010 by software analyst Kajen Thuraaisingham, scoring four points for his specialist subject of the life of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Previous to this, the lowest attained score had been seven points, which was first set by Colin Kidd in 2005. His specialist subject was &quot;The World Chess Championships&quot;. The score was equalled in November 2009 by gas fitter Michael Burton; he only scored two for his specialist subject, angels.

&quot;Mastermind Champion of Champions&quot; was televised Monday to Friday at 7:30pm on BBC Two in the first full week of August 2010. It featured the winners of previous series of &quot;Mastermind&quot;.
===Junior===
==Chair==
Contestants sit in a black leather chair, lit by a solitary spotlight in an otherwise dark studio. The inspiration for this was the interrogations faced by the show&#x27;s creator, Bill Wright, as a prisoner of war in World War II. The original black chair was given to Magnus Magnusson as a souvenir when he retired from the show, and is now owned by his daughter Sally Magnusson who inherited it following her father&#x27;s death in 2007. In 1979 the original black chair was taken by a group of students during the BBC crew&#x27;s evening meal break, and held to ransom to raise money for charity; this delayed the recording of two programmes. The BBC commissioned a duplicate chair which was kept locked in the scenery truck at every recording to thwart similar ransom demands. The duplicate chair was never used on air, except in the title sequence, which was recorded in London while the main chair was on the road. Its current whereabouts are unknown.

The current chair, since 2003, is an Eames Soft Pad Lounge Chair, designed by Charles and Ray Eames in 1969.

==Video game==
A video game adaptation was released for the ZX Spectrum in 1984 by Mirrorsoft. A companion game titled &quot;Mastermind Quizmaster&quot; was released at the same time and was meant to be used in conjunction with the first game. It allowed the user to write their own questions. &quot;Home Computing Weekly&quot; reviewed both games and gave them two out of five stars and said: &quot;I have no doubt that someone, somewhere, will find these two programs of use.&quot; &quot;ZX Computing&quot; also reviewed both games and the computer&#x27;s ability to recognise key words in the answers was praised but the loading times in a four-player game were criticized as too long.

==Parodies==
The programme has been the target for many television spoofs, including a &quot;Two Ronnies&quot; sketch written by David Renwick (a less polished version had previously appeared in the Radio 4 series &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot;) in 1980, featuring Ronnie Barker as Magnus Magnusson and Ronnie Corbett as a contestant named Charlie Smithers, whose specialist subject was &quot;answering the question before last&quot;. A different sketch featured &quot;Monty Python&quot; alumni Michael Palin as Magnusson and Terry Gilliam as a contestant whose speciality was &quot;questions to which the answer is two.&quot;

In 1974, Morecambe and Wise performed a sketch based on &quot;Mastermind&quot;, which featured Magnusson and the black chair. The format was different, however, with Wise, then Morecambe, being asked ten questions each.

In 1975 The Goodies featured &quot;Mastermind&quot; in the episode &quot;Frankenfido&quot; when a dog (Bill Oddie in a suit) appeared on the show and managed to correctly answer questions asked of it as they all had answers that could be represented by growls, such as &quot;bark&quot; and &quot;ruff&quot;.

In the late 1970s, Noel Edmonds&#x27; Sunday lunchtime radio show featured a send-up called &quot;Musty Mind&quot; where a phone-in contestant would be asked ludicrous questions on a parody of a serious subject, such as the &quot;Toad Racing&quot; or, on another occasion, &quot;The Cultural and Social History of Rockall&quot; – Rockall being a bald lump of uninhabited rock in the eastern Atlantic.

The 2003-onwards version has been spoofed by the &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; team, with Jon Culshaw playing John Humphrys. In one send-up, which appeared on the television edition of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, the contestant offered to answer questions on Mary Queen of Scots, but when an answer was given, John Humphrys was shown saying &quot;Yes, but you sexed that answer up&quot;. The sketch was a reference to the controversy caused by the aftermath of the Iraq War. One episode included &quot;Mastermind: The Opera&quot;.

Another spoof was featured in Armando Iannucci&#x27;s &quot;2004: The Stupid Version&quot;, where a contestant&#x27;s specialist subject was &quot;The television series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and Lady Penelope&#x27;s Cockney chauffeur&quot;.

Also in 2004, Johnny Vaughan&#x27;s BBC Three show &quot;Live at Johnny&#x27;s&quot; featured a version called &quot;Mastermind Rejects&quot; — the premise being that the specialist subjects were too ludicrously obscure even for &quot;Mastermind&quot;. In the final show of the series, Magnus Magnusson took over as the quizmaster — it was the last time he would utter the catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;ve started so I&#x27;ll finish&quot; on any form of &quot;Mastermind&quot;. The specialist subject was &quot;The History of the Home Video Recorder, 1972 to 1984&quot;.

On their 2005 Christmas Special, comedy duo French &amp; Saunders parodied the show with Jennifer Saunders playing Abigail Wilson, a pensioner whose special subject is ceramic teapots. She passes on all but one question, which she answers incorrectly.

In 2005, the show was spoofed on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Now Show&quot; where the specialist subject was &quot;Britishness&quot;, relating to the proposed test immigrants may have to take, to prove they can fit in with British society.

Benny Hill parodied &quot;Mastermind&quot; on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; on at least two occasions. In one of the parodies the show was called &quot;Masterbrane&quot;. In each, Benny played the role of Magnusson while Jackie Wright played the hapless contestant.

&quot;Spitting Image&quot; used the &quot;Mastermind&quot; format in a sketch where a Magnus Magnusson puppet asked questions of a Jeffrey Archer puppet whose specialist subject was himself. The twist was that Archer&#x27;s puppet, being incapable of answering questions about himself without exaggeration or evasion, ends the round with zero points.

The BBC&#x27;s satirical current affairs quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; has parodied the show several times, by turning the lights down – except for spotlights above select chairs – and playing the theme tune, before subjecting at least one of the panel to some rigorous questioning. The first occasion was on the 1995 video special, when only regular captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton were asked questions; Hislop on &quot;The Life and Lies of Jeffrey Archer&quot;, and Merton on &quot;Absurd Newspaper Stories Between 1990 and 1995&quot;. The second occasion was in 1998, when Magnus Magnusson appeared as a guest. All four panellists were asked questions on this occasion.

In his early routines Bill Bailey would often parody the &quot;Mastermind&quot; music, finding it very sinister. He would then play the music on keyboard with an over-the-top hellish sounding climax. In the last episode of &quot;Is It Bill Bailey?&quot; he followed on from this performance with a sketch where he was a contestant on Mastermind, and it was implied that his specialist subject was the microwave cooking instructions on supermarket ready meals. As the camera panned out it became evident that the chair itself was on a platter, slowly turning in a giant microwave oven.

The Channel 4 Prank programme &quot;Balls of Steel&quot; parodied &quot;Mastermind&quot; with its sketch &quot;The Alex Zane Cleverness Game&quot;, in which experts were quizzed on their specialist subjects (included were &quot;The Life of Anne Frank&quot;, &quot;Eurovision Song Contest Winners&quot;, and &quot;Hercule Poirot&quot;). Unbeknown to the experts, the show was a hoax, and incorrect answers were included to frustrate them whenever they supplied the correct answer.

The BBC Three comedy show &quot;Snuff Box&quot; had the two main characters Rich Fulcher and Matt Berry both appear on &quot;Mastermind&quot;. Berry chose his specialist subject as Alton Towers and only scored 3 points before a blackout, in which he apparently shoots the host after being told to sit down. Fulcher chooses &#x27;Anglo-Saxon architecture&#x27;, though displays no knowledge of the subject and makes up answers such as &quot;Toto from The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Elvis&quot;, and scoring no points.

In 2011, &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; on BBC Radio 1 parodied the show with a feature called &quot;Disastermind&quot;. Using the back-up chair from the &quot;Mastermind&quot; studio, each team member chose a specialist subject, only to have them swapped before being questioned in the chair on their randomly selected subject and general knowledge. The specialist subjects were The World of &quot;Glee&quot;; UK dialling codes; U2; Husky Dogs and &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Mastermind&quot; featured on the ITV show &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, as part of an Ant Vs Dec segment where Ant and Dec had to answer questions based around a school challenge they took part in. Ant won.

<text>Frederick Antwon Taylor (born January 27, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons from 1998 to 2010. He played college football for the Florida Gators and was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars ninth overall in the 1998 NFL draft. Taylor played for the Jaguars and New England Patriots and is a member of the 10,000 yard rushing club. He is a co-host of The Pivot Podcast with friends, Channing Crowder and Ryan Clark.

== Early life ==
Taylor was born on January 27, 1976, in Pahokee, Florida. He attended Glades Central High School in Belle Glade, Florida, where he was a standout high school football player for the Glades Central Raiders. He was also a letterman in track. Taylor initially played linebacker, but switched to running back as a junior. As a senior, he ran for 1,700 yards and 22 touchdowns, including a 301-yard, 5-touchdown outing. He received Florida &quot;Super Senior&quot; and all-state honors. In 2007, 13 years after he graduated from high school, the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) recognized Taylor as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Players of the First 100 Years&quot; of Florida high school football.

In track &amp; field, Taylor competed as a sprinter. He recorded personal-bests of 10.85 seconds in the 100 meters and 22.32 seconds in the 200 meters. He was also a member of the 4 × 100 m (42.05 seconds) relay team.

== College career ==
Taylor accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier&#x27;s Gators from 1994 to 1997. Taylor started two games as a true freshman, picking up 873 yards and eight touchdowns. As a sophomore in 1995, he played in six games, gaining 281 yards and scoring five touchdowns. Taylor returned in 1996 to start two of the seven games he played, running for 629 yards and five touchdowns, and helping the 12–1 Gators win the national championship. As a senior team captain in 1997, Taylor was the team&#x27;s leading rusher with 1,292 yards on 214 carries and scoring 13 touchdowns, earning first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) recognition and Associated Press third-team All-American honors, and was chosen by his teammates as the Gators&#x27; most valuable player. He finished his college career ranked fourth in school history with 3,075 yards and 31 touchdowns.

In one of a series of articles about the top 100 Gators from the first 100 seasons of Florida football, &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; sports editors ranked Taylor as the No. 36 all-time greatest Gator. He was inducted into the Florida–Georgia Hall of Fame in 2008, and the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 2010. Taylor completed his final class on-line for his degree in sociology and graduated from Florida in the May 2024 commencement ceremony.

== Professional career ==
=== Jacksonville Jaguars ===

Taylor was selected ninth overall in the 1998 NFL draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the first of two picks they acquired in a trade with the Buffalo Bills in exchange for quarterback Rob Johnson. Taylor started 12 of 15 games for the Jaguars as a rookie in 1998, rushing for 1,223 yards and 14 touchdowns, the latter total a career-high, while also catching 44 passes for 421 yards and three touchdowns.

In 1999, Taylor played in ten games, starting nine, missing six due to a hamstring injury. He ranked second on the team with 732 yards, but posted two 100-yard rushing performances in the playoffs. Taylor also recorded the longest run in playoff history with a 90-yard touchdown run in a 62–7 win over Miami. He missed three and a half games in 2000, but still finished sixth in the NFL with 1,399 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns, while making 36 catches for 240 yards for another two touchdowns. Taylor played in the first two games of 2001 before suffering a groin injury and missing the rest of the season.

Overall, injuries caused Taylor to miss 23 out of a potential 48 games from 1999 to 2001. Fans and media were highly critical of Taylor&#x27;s tendency to get injured, questioning his toughness and donning him the moniker &quot;Fragile Fred&quot;, which deeply upset him, as he would later admit. Despite knowing that Taylor&#x27;s season was over in Week 3 of 2001, Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin listed him on the injury report as &quot;questionable&quot; every game for the remainder of the season, further fueling the doubts of Taylor&#x27;s toughness in the minds of fans. He still has not completely rid himself of the stigma and the nickname.

Following the 2001 season, it was alleged that Taylor&#x27;s agent William &quot;Tank&quot; Black had stolen between $12 million and $14 million from players he had represented, and that Black had laundered nearly all of Taylor&#x27;s $5 million signing bonus, the only guaranteed money in his rookie contract. In an interview with Vic Ketchman of Jaguars.com in November 2007, Taylor admitted he seriously considered retiring from football early in his career, because of the difficulties he experienced with injuries and Tank Black.

In 2002, Taylor rebounded to start all 16 games for the Jaguars, finishing the season with 1,314 yards, third most in team history, while setting a then-team record with 1,722 yards from scrimmage. He also set a career-high with 49 receptions, second-highest on the Jaguars, for 408 yards, and also recorded eight touchdowns. He again started all 16 games for the Jaguars in 2003 and set a career-high with 1,572 yards on 345 carries for six touchdowns. He also caught 48 passes for 370 yards. In 2004, Taylor started the first 14 games of the season, recording 1,224 yards and two touchdowns. His streak of 46 consecutive starts ended when a knee injury sidelined him for the final two weeks of the season.

Injuries hampered Taylor again in 2005, as he started 11 games while missing five games with injuries throughout the season. He still led the team with 787 yards rushing while also recording three touchdowns. In 2006, Taylor was joined in the Jaguars backfield by Maurice Jones-Drew, the Jaguars&#x27; second-round pick in the 2006 NFL draft and Taylor&#x27;s eventual replacement. Despite sharing carries throughout the season, Taylor started 15 games and posted a 5.0 yard-per-carry average with 1,146 yards on 231 carries for five touchdowns. He also added 23 receptions for 242 yards and one touchdown. Together, Taylor and Jones-Drew combined for 2,087 yards, the most by two rushers in Jaguars history.

As a team captain in 2007, Taylor rushed for 1,202 yards on 223 carries, a career-best 5.4 yards-per-carry average, in 15 games started. On November 11, Taylor surpassed 10,000 yards career rushing in a game against the Tennessee Titans. Taylor rushed for five straight 100-yard games in late November and December, earning him AFC Offensive Player of the Month honors. He tied for first in the NFL with four rushes of 50-plus yards and finished with two of the four longest rushes in the NFL in 2007. Following the season, he was named to the Associated Press second-team All-Pro team and was named to the 2008 Pro Bowl as an injury replacement, the first such honor of his career.

In his final season with the Jaguars in 2008, Taylor started the first 13 games of the season before being placed on injured reserve for the first time in his career, with a thumb injury, on December 11. A team captain for the second straight season, Taylor surpassed both the 11,000 yards career rushing and 13,000 career all-purpose yards milestones on the year. He finished the season with 556 yards on 113 carries; meanwhile, Jones-Drew, now a third-year player, rushed for 824 yards on 197 carries.

After his 2008 season had ended, when asked about his future with the team, Taylor said, &quot;All of that still has to handle itself. I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s going to play out.&quot; Taylor said that it was clear to him that the organization was headed in &quot;another direction&quot; as a result of his reduced role with the team and the rise in his salary that was due to receive if he had remained on the roster.

On February 16, 2009, Taylor was released by the Jaguars after 11 seasons with the team.

=== New England Patriots ===

Taylor was signed to a two-year contract by the New England Patriots on February 27, 2009. He played in the first four games of the season for the Patriots, starting one, before suffering an ankle injury in Week 4 against the Baltimore Ravens. Despite the fact that the injury was expected to keep him out until late in the season, the Patriots chose not to place Taylor on injured reserve, and instead de-activated him. Taylor returned to the field for the Patriots&#x27; Week 16 matchup with his former team, the Jaguars, on December 27, 2009. He did not play until the fourth quarter, but managed to rush for 35 yards on 11 carries. He finished the season with 269 yards on 63 attempts and four touchdowns.

In 2010, Taylor played in the first three games of the season as a reserve before suffering a toe injury in Week 3 against the Buffalo Bills. He was inactive until Week 12 against the Detroit Lions, but did not play in that game. He saw his first snaps since Week 3 in the fourth quarter of the Patriots&#x27; Week 13 win over the New York Jets. Taylor played in seven games total, all as a reserve, running 43 times for 155 yards (3.6 yard average) and no touchdowns.

=== Retirement ===

On September 2, 2011, Taylor signed a one-day contract with the Jaguars in order to formally retire from the team that had drafted him ninth overall in 1998.

On June 7, 2012, the Jaguars announced that Taylor would become the second player inducted into the Pride of the Jaguars. He was formally inducted on September 30 during the team&#x27;s game against the Cincinnati Bengals.

<text>Ecotage ( ) is sabotage carried out for environmental reasons.

==Cases==


All damage figures below are in United States dollars. Some well-known acts of ecotage have included:
*Circa 1969–1985; ecological activist James F. Phillips, operating covertly under the codename &quot;The Fox&quot;, carried out a series of ecotage actions and subvertising campaigns against corporations that were polluting the Fox River in Illinois.
*1998 – Arson of buildings at Vail Mountain in the United States by the ELF (Earth Liberation Front).
*March 11, 1999 – Genetically engineered potatoes uprooted at Crop and Food research centre in New Zealand.
*December 25, 1999 – In Monmouth, Oregon, fire destroys the main office of the Boise Cascade logging company costing over $1 million ($ million in 2024 dollars). ELF claims responsibility.
*2001 – Members of the ELF were prosecuted for setting off a firebomb that caused $7 million in damages ($ million in 2024 dollars) at the University of Washington&#x27;s Center for Urban Horticulture.
*2003 – On August 1, a 206-unit condominium being built in San Diego, California was burnt down causing damage in excess of $20 million ($ million in 2024 dollars). A 12-foot banner at the scene read &quot;If you build it, we will burn it,&quot; signed, &quot;The E.L.F.s are mad.&quot;
*2003 – On August 22, arsonists associated with the ELF attacked several car dealerships in east suburban Los Angeles, burning down a warehouse and vandalizing over 100 vehicles, most of them SUVs or Hummers (chosen for their notoriously poor fuel efficiency) and causing over $1 million in damage ($ million in 2024 dollars).

==In literature and popular culture==
In their 1972 environmental-action book &quot;Ecotage!&quot;, Sam Love and David Obst claimed to have coined the word &quot;ecotage&quot; by combining &quot;ecology&quot; and &quot;sabotage&quot; to describe a &quot;branch of tactical biology.&quot;

In fiction, the practice of ecotage was popularized in Edward Abbey&#x27;s 1975 anarchistic novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; and its sequel &quot;Hayduke Lives! (&quot;1990). It has also been treated in other novels including Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s &quot;Tourist Season&quot; (1986) and &quot;Sick Puppy&quot; (2000), Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Zodiac: The Eco-Thriller&quot; (1988), T. Coraghessan Boyle&#x27;s &quot;A Friend of the Earth&quot; (2000), Dave Foreman&#x27;s &quot;The Lobo Outback Funeral Home&quot; (2000), and Richard Melo&#x27;s &quot;Jokerman 8&quot; (2004). Radical depictions of environmental protection also inform major Native American novels including N. Scott Momaday&#x27;s &quot;House Made of Dawn&quot; (1968), James Welch&#x27;s &quot;Winter in the Blood&quot; (1974), and Leslie Marmon Silko&#x27;s &quot;Ceremony&quot; (1977).

Several books written specifically for children and young adults have also explored radical responses to environmental endangerment including Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s &quot;Hoot!&quot; (2002), &quot;Flush&quot; (2005), and &quot;Scat&quot; (2009), Claire Dean&#x27;s &quot;Girlwood&quot; (2008), S. Terrell French&#x27;s &quot;Operation Redwood&quot; (2011), and Silas House and Neela Vaswani&#x27;s &quot;Same Sun Here&quot; (2012).

Ecotage is mentioned in the Mars trilogy of science fiction novels by Kim Stanley Robinson as a means of protest shown by the Red political party. Typically the &quot;Reds&quot; would destroy terraforming ventures in an effort to slow the terraforming of Mars.

The Concrete mini series &quot;Think Like a Mountain&quot; is centred about ecotage aimed to protect first growth forests in the Pacific Northwest.

Ecotage also informs movies such as &quot;Choke Canyon&quot; (1986) and &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; (1994).

<doc id="316889" wikidata="Q105420" url="?curid=316889" title="Anthology">
<text>In book publishing, an anthology is a collection of literary works chosen by the compiler; it may be a collection of plays, poems, short stories, songs, or related fiction/non-fiction excerpts by different authors. There are also thematic and genre-based anthologies.

Complete collections of works are often called &quot;complete works&quot; or &quot;&quot; (Latin equivalent).

==Etymology==
The word entered the English language in the 17th century, from the Greek word, ἀνθολογία (&quot;anthologic&quot;, literally &quot;a collection of blossoms&quot;, from , &quot;ánthos&quot;, flower), a reference to one of the earliest known anthologies, the &quot;Garland&quot; (, &quot;stéphanos&quot;), the introduction to which compares each of its anthologized poets to a flower. That &quot;Garland&quot; by Meléagros of Gadara formed the kernel for what has become known as the Greek Anthology.

&quot;Florilegium&quot;, a Latin derivative for a collection of flowers, was used in medieval Europe for an anthology of Latin proverbs and textual excerpts. Shortly before anthology had entered the language, English had begun using florilegium as a word for such a collection.

==Early anthologies==
The Palatine Anthology, discovered in the Palatine Library, Heidelberg in 1606, is a collection of Greek poems and epigrams that was based on the lost 10th Century Byzantine collection of Constantinus Cephalas, which in turn was based on older anthologies. In The Middle Ages, European collections of &quot;florilegia&quot; became popular, bringing together extracts from various Christian and pagan philosophical texts. These evolved into commonplace books and miscellanies, including proverbs, quotes, letters, poems and prayers.

&quot;Songes and Sonettes&quot;, usually called &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, was the first printed anthology of English poetry. It was published by Richard Tottel in 1557 in London and ran to many editions in the sixteenth century. A widely read series of political anthologies, &quot;Poems on Affairs of State&quot;, began its publishing run in 1689, finishing in 1707.

In Britain, one of the earliest national poetry anthologies to appear was &quot;The British Muse&quot; (1738), compiled by William Oldys. Thomas Percy&#x27;s influential &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; (1765), was the first of the great ballad collections, responsible for the ballad revival in English poetry that became a significant part of the Romantic movement. William Enfield&#x27;s &quot;The Speaker; Or, Miscellaneous Pieces&quot; was published in 1774 and was a mainstay of 18th Century schoolrooms. Important nineteenth century anthologies included Palgrave&#x27;s &quot;Golden Treasury&quot; (1861), Edward Arber&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare Anthology&quot; (1899) and the first edition of Arthur Quiller Couch&#x27;s Oxford Book of English Verse (1900).

== Traditional ==
In East Asian tradition, an anthology was a recognized form of compilation of a given poetic form. It was assumed that there was a cyclic development: any particular form, say the &quot;tanka&quot; in Japan, would be introduced at one point in history, be explored by masters during a subsequent time, and finally be subject to popularisation (and a certain dilution) when it achieved widespread recognition. In this model, which derives from Chinese tradition, the object of compiling an anthology was to preserve the best of a form, and cull the rest.

In Malaysia, an anthology (or &quot;antologi&quot; in Malay) is a collection of &quot;syair&quot;, &quot;sajak&quot; (or modern prose), proses, drama scripts, and pantuns. Notable anthologies that are used in secondary schools include &quot;Sehijau Warna Daun&quot;, &quot;Seuntai Kata Untuk Dirasa&quot;, &quot;Anak Bumi Tercinta&quot;, &quot;Anak Laut&quot; and &quot;Kerusi&quot;.

== Twentieth century ==
In the twentieth century, anthologies became an important part of poetry publishing for a number of reasons. For English poetry, the Georgian poetry series was trend-setting; it showed the potential success of publishing an identifiable group of younger poets marked out as a &#x27;generation&#x27;. It was followed by numerous collections from the &#x27;stable&#x27; of some literary editor, or collated from a given publication, or labelled in some fashion as &#x27;poems of the year&#x27;. Academic publishing also followed suit, with the continuing success of the Quiller-Couch &quot;Oxford Book of English Verse&quot; encouraging other collections not limited to modern poetry. Not everyone approved. Robert Graves and Laura Riding published their &quot;Pamphlet Against Anthologies&quot; in 1928, arguing that they were based on commercial rather than artistic interests.

The concept of &#x27;modern verse&#x27; was fostered by the appearance of the phrase in titles such as the Faber &amp; Faber anthology by Michael Roberts in 1936, and the very different William Butler Yeats Oxford Book of Modern Verse of the same year. In the 1960s &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot; anthology of Liverpool poets became a bestseller, plugging into the countercultural attitudes of teenagers.

Since publishers generally found anthology publication a more flexible medium than the collection of a single poet&#x27;s work, and indeed rang innumerable changes on the idea as a way of marketing poetry, publication in an anthology (in the right company) became at times a sought-after form of recognition for poets. The self-definition of movements, dating back at least to Ezra Pound&#x27;s efforts on behalf of Imagism, could be linked on one front to the production of an anthology of the like-minded.

Also, whilst not connected with poetry, publishers have produced collective works of fiction and non-fiction from a number of authors and used the term anthology to describe the collective nature of the text. These have been in a number of subjects, including &quot;Erotica&quot;, edited by Mitzi Szereto, and &quot;American Gothic Tales&quot; edited by Joyce Carol Oates. &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Cloak: An Anthology of the World&#x27;s Greatest Diarists&quot;, published in 2000, anthologises four centuries of diary entries into 365 &#x27;days&#x27;.

<text>The marsh sandpiper (Tringa stagnatilis) is a small wader. It is a rather small shank, and breeds in open grassy steppe and taiga wetlands from easternmost Europe to the Russian Far East. The genus name &quot;Tringa&quot; is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific &quot;stagnatilis&quot; is from Latin &quot;stagnum&quot;, &quot;swamp&quot;.
==Description==
The marsh sandpiper resembles a small elegant greenshank, with a long fine bill and very long yellowish legs. Like the greenshank, it is greyish brown in breeding plumage, paler in winter, and has a white wedge up its back that is visible in flight. However, it is more closely related to the common redshank and the wood sandpiper. Together, they form a group of smallish shanks which tend to have red or reddish legs, and in breeding plumage are generally a subdued, light brown above with some darker mottling, with a pattern of somewhat diffuse small brownish spots on the breast and neck. The length is , wingspan is and weight is .

==Distribution==
The marsh sandpiper breeds in the Palearctic. It is a migratory species, with a majority of birds wintering in Africa and India, and some migrating to Southeast Asia and Australia. They prefer to winter on fresh water wetlands such as swamps and lakes and are usually seen singly or in small groups.

Marsh sandpipers are rare vagrants to North America, with most records in Alaska and California. The first marsh sandpiper recorded in Canada was found on 30 April 2022 in Thedford, Lambton County, Ontario by James Holdsworth, and attracted over a thousand birders from Ontario and Michigan, as well as birders from as far away as Texas and Washington State.

The marsh sandpiper is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>The 25th government of Ireland (26 June 1997 – 6 June 2002) was the government of Ireland formed after the 1997 general election to the 28th Dáil held on 6 June 1997. It was a minority coalition government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, led by Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach. It lasted .

==Nomination of Taoiseach==
The 28th Dáil first met on 26 June 1997. In the debate on the nomination of Taoisech, both outgoing Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader John Bruton and Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern were proposed. The vote on Bruton was defeated with 75 votes in favour to 87 against, while the vote on Ahern was approved by 85 to 78. Ahern was then appointed as Taoiseach by President Mary Robinson.

==Government ministers==
After his appointment by the president, Bertie Ahern proposed the members of the government and they were approved by the Dáil. They were appointed by the president on the same day.
;Changes to Departments
==Attorney General==
David Byrne SC was appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach. In 1999, he resigned on his nomination as European Commissioner. On 17 July 1999, Michael McDowell SC was appointed by the president as Attorney General on the nomination of the Taoiseach.

==Ministers of state==
==Confidence in the government==
After evidence given by Ahern at the Moriarty Tribunal, a motion of no confidence was proposed in the government. This was then debated on 30 June 2000 as a motion of confidence in the government, proposed by the Taoiseach. It was approved by the Dáil.

==Dissolution==
On 25 April 2002, the president dissolved the Dáil on the advice of the Taoiseach, and a general election was held on 17 May. The 29th Dáil met on 6 June and Bertie Ahern was re-appointed as Taoiseach and formed a new government.

<doc id="316904" wikidata="Q5348622" url="?curid=316904" title="Ehrhart polynomial">
<text>In mathematics, an integral polytope has an associated Ehrhart polynomial that encodes the relationship between the volume of a polytope and the number of integer points the polytope contains. The theory of Ehrhart polynomials can be seen as a higher-dimensional generalization of Pick&#x27;s theorem in the Euclidean plane.

These polynomials are named after Eugène Ehrhart who studied them in the 1960s.

==Definition==
Informally, if is a polytope, and is the polytope formed by expanding by a factor of in each dimension, then is the number of integer lattice points in .

More formally, consider a lattice formula_1 in Euclidean space formula_2 and a -dimensional polytope in formula_2 with the property that all vertices of the polytope are points of the lattice. (A common example is formula_4 and a polytope for which all vertices have integer coordinates.) For any positive integer , let be the -fold dilation of (the polytope formed by multiplying each vertex coordinate, in a basis for the lattice, by a factor of ), and let

:formula_5

be the number of lattice points contained in the polytope . Ehrhart showed in 1962 that is a rational polynomial of degree in , i.e. there exist rational numbers formula_6 such that:

:formula_7

for all positive integers .

The Ehrhart polynomial of the interior of a closed convex polytope can be computed as:

:formula_8

where is the dimension of . This result is known as Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity.

==Examples==
Let be a -dimensional unit hypercube whose vertices are the integer lattice points all of whose coordinates are 0 or 1. In terms of inequalities,

:formula_9

Then the -fold dilation of is a cube with side length , containing integer points. That is, the Ehrhart polynomial of the hypercube is . Additionally, if we evaluate at negative integers, then

: formula_10

as we would expect from Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity.

Many other figurate numbers can be expressed as Ehrhart polynomials. For instance, the square pyramidal numbers are given by the Ehrhart polynomials of a square pyramid with an integer unit square as its base and with height one; the Ehrhart polynomial in this case is .

==Ehrhart quasi-polynomials==
Let be a rational polytope. In other words, suppose

:formula_11

where formula_12 and formula_13 (Equivalently, is the convex hull of finitely many points in formula_14) Then define

:formula_15

In this case, is a quasi-polynomial in . Just as with integral polytopes, Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity holds, that is,

: formula_16

==Examples of Ehrhart quasi-polynomials==
Let be a polygon with vertices (0,0), (0,2), (1,1) and (, 0). The number of integer points in will be counted by the quasi-polynomial 

: formula_17

==Interpretation of coefficients==
If is closed (i.e. the boundary faces belong to ), some of the coefficients of have an easy interpretation:

* the leading coefficient, formula_18, is equal to the -dimensional volume of , divided by (see lattice for an explanation of the content or covolume of a lattice);

* the second coefficient, formula_19, can be computed as follows: the lattice induces a lattice on any face of ; take the -dimensional volume of , divide by , and add those numbers for all faces of ;

* the constant coefficient, formula_20, is the Euler characteristic of . When is a closed convex polytope, formula_21.

==The Betke–Kneser theorem==
Ulrich Betke and Martin Kneser established the following characterization of the Ehrhart coefficients. A functional formula_22 defined on integral polytopes is an formula_23 and translation invariant valuation if and only if there are real numbers formula_24 such that

:formula_25

==Ehrhart series==
We can define a generating function for the Ehrhart polynomial of an integral -dimensional polytope as

: formula_26

This series can be expressed as a rational function. Specifically, Ehrhart proved (1962) that there exist complex numbers formula_27, formula_28, such that the Ehrhart series of is

:formula_29

Richard P. Stanley&#x27;s non-negativity theorem states that under the given hypotheses, formula_27 will be non-negative integers, for formula_28.

Another result by Stanley shows that if is a lattice polytope contained in , then formula_32 for all . The formula_33-vector is in general not unimodal, but it is whenever it is symmetric and the polytope has a regular unimodular triangulation.

===Ehrhart series for rational polytopes===
As in the case of polytopes with integer vertices, one defines the Ehrhart series for a rational polytope. For a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional rational polytope , where is the smallest integer such that is an integer polytope ( is called the denominator of ), then one has

:formula_34

where the formula_27 are still non-negative integers.

== Non-leading coefficient bounds ==
The polynomial&#x27;s non-leading coefficients formula_36 in the representation 

:formula_37 

can be upper bounded:

:formula_38

where formula_39 is the Stirling number of the first kind. Lower bounds also exist.

==Toric variety==
The case formula_40 and formula_41 of these statements yields Pick&#x27;s theorem. Formulas for the other coefficients are much harder to get; Todd classes of toric varieties, the Riemann–Roch theorem as well as Fourier analysis have been used for this purpose.

If is the toric variety corresponding to the normal fan of , then defines an ample line bundle on , and the Ehrhart polynomial of coincides with the Hilbert polynomial of this line bundle.

Ehrhart polynomials can be studied for their own sake. For instance, one could ask questions related to the roots of an Ehrhart polynomial. Furthermore, some authors have pursued the question of how these polynomials could be classified.

==Generalizations==
It is possible to study the number of integer points in a polytope if we dilate some facets of but not others. In other words, one would like to know the number of integer points in semi-dilated polytopes. It turns out that such a counting function will be what is called a multivariate quasi-polynomial. An Ehrhart-type reciprocity theorem will also hold for such a counting function.

Counting the number of integer points in semi-dilations of polytopes has applications in enumerating the number of different dissections of regular polygons and the number of non-isomorphic unrestricted codes, a particular kind of code in the field of coding theory.

<text>The wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola) is a small wader belonging to the sandpiper family Scolopacidae. A Eurasian species, it is the smallest of the shanks, a genus of mid-sized, long-legged waders that largely inhabit freshwater and wetland environments, as opposed to the maritime or coastal habitats of other, similar species. 

==Taxonomy==
The wood sandpiper was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Tringa glareola&quot;. Linnaeus cited his own &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot; that had been published in 1746. He specified the type locality as Europe but it is now restricted to Sweden. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name, &quot;Tringa&quot;, is the Neo-Latin name given to the green sandpiper (&quot;Tringa ochropus&quot;) in 1599 by Aldrovandus, based on the Ancient Greek &quot;trungas&quot;, a &quot;thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing&quot; wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific &quot;glareola&quot; is from the Latin &quot;glarea&quot;, meaning &quot;gravel&quot;.

==Description==
The wood sandpiper resembles a longer-legged, more delicate form of the aforementioned green sandpiper (&quot;T. ochropus&quot;), or a solitary sandpiper (&quot;T. solitaria&quot;), albeit with a shorter, finer bill, brown back and longer yellowish legs. The wood sandpiper differs from the green by having a smaller, less contrasting white rump-patch, while the solitary sandpiper has no rump-patch, at all. However, the wood sandpiper is not closely related to these two species; its closest relative is the common redshank (&quot;T. totanus&quot;), with which it shares a sister relationship with the marsh sandpiper (&quot;T. stagnatilis&quot;). These three species are a group of smallish shanks with red or yellowish legs, displaying a breeding plumage of subdued, light-brown above (with some darker mottling), and a pattern of somewhat smaller, diffuse, brownish spots on the breast and neck.

==Distribution and habitat==
The wood sandpiper breeds in subarctic wetlands, from the Scottish Highlands in the west, east across Eurasia and the Palearctic. They will migrate to Africa, South Asia (particularly India) and Australia. Vagrant birds have been seen as far into the Pacific as the Hawaiian Islands. In Micronesia, it is a regular visitor to Palau and the Mariana Islands, where flocks of up to 32 birds have been reported; it is observed and recorded on Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, approximately once each decade. The wood sandpiper is also encountered in the Western Pacific region of East Asia and some Western Pacific islands between mid-October and mid-May. A slight westward-expansion saw the establishment of a small resident breeding population in Scotland, beginning in the 1950s. This species is usually found in and around freshwater habitats during migration and wintering.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Mature wood sandpipers moult all of their primary feathers between August and December, whilst juvenile birds shed a varying number of outer primaries between December and April, much closer to their departure from Africa. Immature birds are also much more flexible than older birds regarding the timing (and rate) of their moult and refueling. Adults and immatures which accumulate fuel loads of c.50% of their lean body mass can potentially cross distances of 2397–4490 km in one non-stop flight.

===Breeding===
The wood sandpiper nests primarily on the ground, or will re-use an abandoned tree nest of another bird species, such as the fieldfare (&quot;Turdus pilaris&quot;). Four pale-green eggs are laid between March and May. These are incubated by both sexes beginning with the last egg. They hatch after 22 to 23 days. They are initially cared for by both parents but the female normally departs after a few days. The young can feed themselves. The young fledge when aged around 30 days.

===Food and feeding===
They forage for invertebrates by probing their bills in shallow water or into wet mud, such as lakeshores or riverbanks, and mainly eat aquatic insects, crustaceans, arthropods, various worms, and other small prey.

==Conservation status==
The wood sandpiper is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. With an apparently stable, healthy global population, it is considered a Species of Least Concern, as per the IUCN.

<text>Erna Berger (19 October 1900 – 14 June 1990) was a German lyric coloratura soprano. She was best known for roles such as Queen of the Night and Konstanze.

==Career==
Born in Dresden, Germany, Berger spent some years as a child in India and South America. She lived there later on as well, working as a clerk and a piano teacher, before borrowing enough money for the trip back to Germany. At age 26, she secured a position as a soubrette soprano at the Semperoper in Dresden and had her first success as Hannele in Paul Graener&#x27;s opera &quot;Hanneles Himmelfahrt&quot;, based on Gerhart Hauptmann&#x27;s play &quot;The Assumption of Hannele&quot;. She later held leading positions at the Vienna State Opera, the Berlin State Opera, and the Deutsche Oper Berlin. She gave concerts in Japan, the United States, and Australia.

Her discography features complete recordings of &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (as the Queen of Night, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, 1937–38, for EMI), and &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, with Jan Peerce and Leonard Warren, conducted by Renato Cellini (1950) which was the first complete opera recording (with a few minor cuts) made in the United States by RCA Victor for commercial release on the then-new LP format.

Erna Berger was a member of the Berlin State Opera from 1934 to 1946. She is listed on &#x27;Gottbegnadeten-Liste [God&#x27;s Gifted List]&#x27; by Goebbels as an important artist of the Nazi state.

Berger appeared at the Metropolitan Opera during the 1949/50 and 1950/51 seasons, in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (opposite Eleanor Steber and Risë Stevens, conducted by Fritz Reiner and directed by Herbert Graf), &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (with Warren, then Enzo Mascherini), &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, and &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; (with Giuseppe Valdengo). She also sang Woglinde and the Waldvogel in &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, with Kirsten Flagstad and Helen Traubel alternating as Brünnhilde.

She sang the role of Zerlina in the 1954 Salzburg Festival production of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler, filmed by Paul Czinner and released on DVD by Deutsche Grammophon. As an interpreter of Lieder, she often performed with the German pianist Sebastian Peschko.

==Later years and death==
Despite advancing years Berger&#x27;s voice did not lose its purity, range and beautiful tone. Though she retired from the operatic stage in 1955, she continued to sing in recitals well into her 60s, giving her last song recital in Munich in 1968. In 1980, to celebrate her eightieth birthday, she &quot;spontaneously sang over live German television Schubert&#x27;s &#x27;Im Abendroth&#x27; with moving devotion and a fine, warm quality.&quot;

Between 1960 and 1971 Berger taught at Hamburg and Essen. She was highly respected by her colleagues; as Furtwängler said: ‘She is music, through and through…the best’. She died in Essen in 1990, aged 89. She was buried at the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna. In 1992, the Bästleinstraße in Dresden was renamed the Erna-Berger-Straße in her honour.

<text>Ecological health is a term that has been used in relation to both human health and the condition of the environment.
* In medicine, ecological health has been used to refer to multiple chemical sensitivity, which results from exposure to synthetic chemicals (pesticides, smoke, etc.) in the environment, hence the term ecological.
* The term has also been used in medicine with respect to management of environmental factors (taxes, health insurance surcharges) that may reduce the risk of unhealthy behavior such as smoking.
* As an urban planning term, ecological health refers to the &quot;greenness&quot; of cities, meaning composting, recycling, and energy efficiency.
* With respect to broader environmental issues, ecological health has been defined as &quot;the goal for the condition at a site that is cultivated for crops, managed for tree harvest, stocked for fish, urbanized, or otherwise intensively used.&quot;

Ecological health differs from ecosystem health, the condition of ecosystems, which have particular structural and functional properties, and it differs from ecological integrity, which refers to environments with minimal human impact, although the term ecological health has also been used loosely in reference to a range of environmental issues. Human health, in its broadest sense, is recognized as having ecological foundations.

The term health is intended to evoke human environmental health concerns, which are often closely related (but as a part of medicine not ecology). As with ecocide, that term assumes that ecosystems can be said to be alive &quot;(see also Gaia philosophy on this issue).&quot; While the term integrity or damage seems to take no position on this, it does assume that there is a definition of integrity that can be said to apply to ecosystems. The more political term ecological wisdom refers not only to recognition of a level of health, integrity or potential damage, but also, to a decision to do nothing (more) to harm that ecosystem or its dependents. An ecosystem has a good health if it is capable of self-restoration after suffering external disturbances. This is termed resilience.

Measures of broad ecological health, like measures of the more specific principle of biodiversity, tend to be specific to an ecoregion or even to an ecosystem. Measures that depend on biodiversity are valid indicators of ecological health as stability and productivity (good indicators of ecological health) are two ecological effects of biodiversity. Dependencies between species vary so much as to be difficult to express abstractly. However, there are a few universal symptoms of poor health or damage to system integrity:
* The buildup of waste material and the proliferation of simpler life forms (bacteria, insects) that thrive on it - but no consequent population growth in those species that normally prey on them;
* The loss of keystone species, often a top predator, causing smaller carnivores to proliferate, very often overstressing herbivore populations;
* A higher rate of species mortality due to disease rather than predation, climate, or food scarcity;
* The migration of whole species into or out of a region, contrary to established or historical patterns;
* The proliferation of a bioinvader or even a monoculture where previously a more biodiverse species range existed.

Some practices such as organic farming, sustainable forestry, natural landscaping, wild gardening or precision agriculture, sometimes combined into sustainable agriculture, are thought to improve or at least not to degrade ecological health, while still keeping land usable for human purposes. This is difficult to investigate as part of ecology, but is increasingly part of discourse on agricultural economics and conservation.

Ecotage is another tactic thought to be effective by some in protecting the health of ecosystems, but this is hotly disputed. In general, low confrontation and much attention to political virtues is thought to be important to maintaining ecological health, as it is far faster and simpler to destroy an ecosystem than protect it—thus wars on behalf of ecosystem integrity may simply lead to more rapid despoliation and loss due to competition.

Deforestation and the habitat destruction of deep-sea coral reef are two issues that prompt deep investigation of what makes for ecological health, and fuels a great many debates. The role of clearcuts, plantations, and trawler nets is often portrayed as negative in the extreme, held akin to the role of weapons on human life. (See Human impact on the environment.)

<doc id="316912" wikidata="Q1361017" url="?curid=316912" title="Ford Torino">
<text>The Ford Torino is an automobile that was produced by Ford for the North American market between 1968 and 1976. It was a competitor in the intermediate market segment and essentially a twin to the Mercury Montego line.

Just as the Ford LTD had been the upscale version of the Ford Galaxie, the Torino was initially an upscale variation of the intermediate-sized Ford Fairlane. In the 1968 and 1969 model years, the intermediate Ford line consisted of lower-trim Fairlanes and its subseries, the upper-trim Torino models. In 1970, Torino became the primary name for Ford&#x27;s intermediate, and the Fairlane was now a subseries of the Torino. In 1971, the Fairlane name was dropped altogether, and all Ford intermediates were called Torino.

Most Torinos were conventional cars, and generally the most popular models were the four-door sedans and two-door hardtops. However, Ford produced some high-performance &quot;muscle car&quot; versions of the Torino by fitting them with large powerful engines, such as the and &quot;Cobra-Jet&quot; engines. Ford also chose the Torino as the base for its NASCAR entrants, and it has a successful racing heritage.

== First generation (1968–1969) ==

=== 1968 ===

For 1968, Ford redesigned its intermediate Fairlane line and introduced a new premium subseries model, the Torino, named after the city of Turin (&quot;Torino&quot;, in Italian), considered &quot;the Italian Detroit&quot;. The name had been one of several originally proposed for the Mustang while in development. The 1968 Fairlane and Torino used the same wheelbases as its 1967 predecessor: on 2- and 4-door models, and for station wagon models.
Styling was drastically changed from the 1967 Fairlane models, boosting size and weight. The front fascia had a full width recessed grille, with horizontal quad headlights placed at the outer edges. Some models had horizontal dividing bars in the grille. To meet new regulations introduced in 1968, parking lights were placed at the outer edge of the front fenders and wrapped around the corner to also act as side marker lights. The body sides were smooth with one horizontal body crease running just below the beltline from front to back. The rectangular taillights were vertically situated in the rear panel above the rear bumper. Reverse lights sat in the middle of the taillights, and reflectors were on the rear edge of the quarter panel.

A new addition for 1968 was the two-door hardtop fastback &quot;SportsRoof&quot; bodystyle. Similar to Mustang fastback models, it featured a gently sloped roof line that extended to the edge of the trunk lid and a unique concave taillamp panel. This new fastback body style gave the Fairlane and the Torino excellent aerodynamics that would later prove to be advantageous on the race track.

Ford had 14 models in its intermediate line for 1968. The base model was the &quot;Fairlane&quot;, which was available in a 2-door hardtop, a 4-door sedan, and a 4-door station wagon. Next was the mid level &quot;Fairlane 500&quot;, which was available as a 2-door hardtop, 2-door SportsRoof, convertible, and a 4-door sedan and station wagon. This was followed by the top level &quot;Torino&quot; series, which consisted of a 2-door formal(notchback) hardtop, a 4-door sedan, and the Squire station wagon that featured wood grained applique. Finally, the &quot;Torino GT&quot;, the sporty version of the Fairlane 500 series, included the formal hardtop, the SportsRoof hardtop, and a convertible.

The 1968 Fairlane/Torino was constructed with unibody chassis using the same platform as the 1966–67 models. The front suspension consisted of short/long control arms with coil springs mounted on an upper control arm and a strut stabilized lower control arm. Rear suspension consisted of long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.

The interior on the Fairlane/Torino was all new for 1968. A new dashboard featured four equally sized round pods centred around the steering wheel. However, the pods did not contain a full set of gauges; rather an assortment of warning lights along with the speedometer and fuel gauge. The fuel gauge and temperature warning lights were in the first pod, a speedometer was located in the second pod from the left, alternator and oil pressure warning lights were in the third pod from the left and the fourth pod was blank. An optional tachometer was available, which would be located in the third pod, and an optional clock occupied the fourth pod. Ford offered many upholstery options, including a knitted vinyl option, called &quot;comfortweave.&quot; This unique option allowed the vinyl to &quot;breathe&quot; unlike conventional vinyl, offering more comfort in hot weather. Conforming to U.S. safety standards, there was much padding inside the Torino&#x27;s interior, which also featured shoulder belts for front outboard passengers on all cars built after December 31, 1967.

 All Torinos included full colour-keyed carpeting, additional exterior and interior trim over a Fairlane, and Torino crests on the &#x27;C&#x27; pillar. The Torino GT&#x27;s standard features included special name plaques and exterior trim, GT markings on wheel covers and courtesy lights on the inside door panels. Initial sales literature showed that bucket seats were standard equipment. However, due to a six-week UAW strike, the GT&#x27;s standard seating was changed to a bench seat. The Torino GT was available with a GT handling suspension package, which included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks, and a heavy-duty front anti-sway bar. Of note, when the 428 CJ engine was installed, the suspensions used the stiffest springs and largest front sway bar compared to other Torinos with the heavy-duty suspension. Four-speed equipped cars used staggered rear shocks which helped resist axle hop. GTs were available with a stripe option, which started as a &#x27;C&#x27; shape at the edge of the front fender, and two body stripes extended the length of the car.

Ford had quite a variety of engine options for its intermediate line. All models other than the Torino GT came standard with a six-cylinder engine. Torino GT models came standard with a -2V small block V8 and this was also the base V8 engine optional on other models. Other available engines included a -2V FE engine, -4V FE engine and a -4V FE engine. About one month within the beginning of the 1968 model year production, a six-week UAW strike against Ford occurred. This resulted in a cost-cutting measure of making a -2V small block V8 the base V8 engine and the standard engine on the Torino GT. Ford did not change any of its factory sales literature to reflect this change. While the -4V FE engine was initially listed as an engine option for 1968 in factory literature, no Fairlanes or Torinos were actually produced with this engine during 1968. Introduced on April 1, 1968, the -4V CJ (Cobra-Jet) FE engine became available as an engine option, but due to its mid-year introduction these engines are very rare. The 428-4V Cobra-Jet was the most potent engine available for 1968, and is general believed to be under-rated at . The cars equipped with the 428 Cobra Jets had emblems borrowed from the full-sized Fords (a red-and-chrome badge reading &quot;428&quot;) mounted on the fenders behind the parking lamps. All models came standard with a three-speed manual transmission. Two Cruise-O-Matic automatics and a four-speed manual were optional. The C4 automatic was installed on smaller displacement engines up to the 302 V8, and C6 automatic was installed on all other larger displacement engines.

According to contemporary reviews, when equipped properly the Torino GT offered a good combination of power and handling. In &quot;Car Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s test of a 1968 Torino GT SportsRoof equipped with a 390-4V, C-6, and 3.25:1 axle, they recorded a 0 – time of 7.7 seconds, and the quarter-mile (402 m) dragstrip time of 15.8 seconds at . &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine wrote &quot;Putting the car through quick and/or tight corners isn&#x27;t a matter of practiced art – it&#x27;s more like second nature for the GT&quot; in their test of a 1968 Torino GT. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine tested a 1968 Ford Torino GT equipped with the 428 CJ with Ram Air induction, C-6 Cruise-O-Matic, and 3.91:1 gears and recorded a quarter-mile time of 14.2 seconds at . &quot;Car and Driver&quot; wrote the Torino had &quot;a 1–2 shift that broke the Wide-Ovals loose for at least a length. With a price tag of $306 for the Cobra-Jet option, Ford lovers have a reason to rejoice.&quot;

Station wagons came in three different models: &quot;Fairlane&quot;, &quot;Fairlane 500&quot;, and &quot;Torino Squire.&quot; All wagons came equipped with Ford&#x27;s &quot;Magic Doorgate&quot; two-way tailgate, and were available with an optional rear-facing third seat which increased the car&#x27;s carrying capacity from 6 to 8 people. Torino Squire models came standard with simulated woodgrain side panels, and had the more refined trim and upholstery of the Torino sedans. Unique station wagon options included a chrome roof rack and a power rear window.

1968 was a successful year for Torino with 172,083 units produced. Including Fairlane production, 371,787 cars were produced. The Torino was well received by the automotive press and a 1968 Torino GT convertible was selected as the 1968 Indianapolis 500 pace car.

=== 1969 ===
The 1969 Fairlane/Torino saw some cosmetic changes, and there were quite a few performance oriented changes. Ford performed the typical minor styling adjustments, but overall the 1969 models were similar in appearance to the 1968 models. The grille was revised slightly, and now had a more prominent centre dividing bar, while the taillights were restyled on non-fastback models to be similar to the 1969 Ford full-size cars. Fastbacks retained the 1968-style taillights and rear panel. All models above the Fairlane, had an aluminium dividing bar that ran across the rear panel, between the taillights and inline with the reverse lights on SportsRoof models.

The number of models produced by Ford increased for 1969, from 14 to 16. All carryover models were the same as 1968, with the two new models being the &quot;Cobra&quot; 2-door SportsRoof and 2-door hardtop. Some automotive literature list these models as &quot;Torino Cobra&quot;, with the Cobra being a sub-series to the Torino. The Cobra has the same body code as a Fairlane 500, so some sources refer to these cars as the &quot;Fairlane Cobra&quot;. Most of Ford&#x27;s literature at the time only used the name &quot;Cobra&quot; without Torino or Fairlane attached. The car itself did not have any Fairlane or Torino nameplates on its exterior or interior, although 1969 NASCAR entrants were labeled &quot;Torino Cobras.&quot; For the purpose of this article, only &quot;Cobra&quot; will be used, as Ford marketed the car as such in 1969 without Fairlane or Torino attached.

The engine line-up was slightly revised for 1969. All models, except Torino GTs and Cobras, came standard with a new larger I-6 engine. The larger displacement produced more power and torque than the engine. Optional engines included the -2V (standard on GTs), the new for 1969 -2V Windsor, 351-4V Windsor, -4V, and the -4V Cobra Jet (standard on Cobras). The 428 CJ was available with or without the Ram Air Induction package, however, those with Ram Air still carried the same advertised power rating. The 428 CJ without Ram Air, came with an 80-ampere heavy-duty battery, 3.25:1 open differential, heavy-duty cooling package, 55-ampere alternator, chrome valve covers and dual exhaust. The Ram Air 428 CJ included all of the above, but had a 3.50:1 open differential, and the functional hood scoop. With Ram Air, &quot;428 Cobra Jet&quot; emblems were placed on each side of the hood scoop; without Ram Air, &quot;428&quot; emblems were placed on the front fender. The 428 Cobra Jet had a 735 cfm Holley four-barrel carburetor. Transmission options remain unchanged; however, the FMX was added to the Torino line-up and was sometimes used instead of the C-4 and C-6.

The 428 CJ was no longer the top engine choice; superseded by the 428-4V Super Cobra Jet (SCJ). This engine was specifically designed for drag racing, and it was included with the &quot;Drag Pack&quot; option package. The Drag Pack option package could be ordered with the Q-code 428-4V or the R-code &#x27;Ram Air&#x27; equipped 428-4V, and would transform either engine into a Super Cobra Jet. Included with 428 SCJ were cast pistons, a nodular controlled cast-iron crankshaft casting 1UA or 1UA B with an external weight on the snout behind the balancer, 427 (LeMans) capscrew connecting rods, an engine oil cooler, and either a rear axle with 3.91:1 gears and a Traction-Lock limited slip or 4.30:1 gears with a Detroit Locker. The Detroit Locker and the oil cooler were industry exclusives to Ford. This package did not change Ford&#x27;s advertised power rating of .
The Cobra was Ford&#x27;s attempt at making a muscle car package that focused on performance features. As a result, the Cobra came standard with a 428-4V CJ, competition suspension, 4-speed manual transmission and F70-14 tires. The Cobra had a blacked out grille, hood lock pins, and &quot;Cobra&quot; emblems. A hood scoop was standard on Ram Air equipped Cobras, while a non-functional scoop was optional on other Cobras. Early Cobras had a large &quot;Cobra&quot; decal on the front fenders, but this was later replaced with a metal emblem. The Cobra was Ford&#x27;s response to the successful Plymouth Road Runner, which was a high-performance car at low cost. For this reason, the Cobra had the lesser trim level of the Fairlane 500 to help keep costs low. &quot;Road Test&quot; magazine wrote the &quot;big engine and whopping torque get the Cobra Jet off the line with smoking tires&quot; in their test of a 1969 Cobra with the Ram Air 428 CJ, four-speed manual, and 3.50 gears. They obtained 15.07 seconds at for a quarter-mile run; however, according to the article, the elapsed time was likely hampered due to the car not being equipped with a tachometer. &quot;Road Test&quot; reported difficulty with the factory shifter and stated &quot;we would have liked a Hurst shifter, and might have bettered our times with one.&quot;

The Torino GT was relatively unchanged from 1968. The grille received minor updates, including revised divider bars and the GT emblem moved to the lower left corner of the grille. The &#x27;C&#x27; stripe was revised, and now ran in straight lines, rather than following the body line like in 1968. All 1969 Torino GT&#x27;s came equipped a non-functional fibreglass hood scoop that had turn signal indicators at the rear of the scoop. This scoop was functional if the 428-4V and Ram Air induction options were specified. The hood scoop could also be deleted from the GT for a credit. Although the Torino GT could be optioned to include all of the Cobra&#x27;s performance features, the GT was a more upscale vehicle which had the more deluxe Torino trim.

Ford added one more special high-performance vehicle to its intermediate line-up, the Torino Talladega. See the NASCAR Inspired Torinos section for a detailed information on this model. Ford Torino production decreased for 1969, and a total of 129,054 units were produced. Including Fairlane production, 366,911 cars were produced, slightly down from the 1968 numbers. Torino GTs were the majority of Torinos produced, accounting for 81,822 units produced. Ford did not provide separate production number for the Cobra.
== Second generation (1970–1971) ==

=== 1970 ===
For 1970, the Torino became the primary model and the Fairlane became a sub-series of Torino. Ford moved away from emulating the boxy lines of the full-size Fords to a completely new body for the 1970 Torino/Fairlane line influenced by coke bottle styling. Just as tailfins were influenced by jet aircraft of the 1950s, stylists such as Ford stylist Bill Shenk who designed the 1970 Ford Torino were inspired by supersonic aircraft with narrow waists and bulging forward and rear fuselages needed to reach supersonic speeds (see Area rule).

The 1970 Torino had more prominent long hood short deck styling, and was longer, lower and wider than the 1969 models. All models had a lower and less formal roofline compared to previous years. The windshield rake was increased, and the SportsRoof models had an even flatter fastback roofline. The Torino had a pointed front end and overall styling appeared much more aerodynamic than years previous. The grille covered the full width of the front fascia and surrounded the quad headlights. The front fender line extended to front door, sloping downward and gradually disappearing in the quarter panel. Both front and rear bumpers were slim tight fitting chromed units, that followed the body lines. The taillights were situated in the rear panel above the bumper, and were now long rectangular units with rounded outer edges.

The model line-up for 1970 initially featured 13 models. The base model &quot;Fairlane 500&quot;, was available in a 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon. Next the mid-level &quot;Torino&quot; was available as a 2-door and 4-door hardtop, a 4-door sedan and station wagon. The 4-door pillarless hardtop was a new body style for the 1970 model year (Chevrolet introduced this body style for its intermediate Chevelle starting in 1966). The &quot;Torino Brougham,&quot; the top trim level, was available as a 2-door and 4-door hardtop, and a 4-door station wagon. The sporty &quot;Torino GT&quot; was available as a 2-door SportsRoof and convertible. The performance model, the &quot;Torino Cobra&quot; was available as a 2-door SportsRoof only.

To add to this extensive line-up, the Falcon name was added mid-year as a new entry-level intermediate. The Ford Falcon compact model continued for the first half of the 1970 model year, but was discontinued as it could not meet new federal standards that came into effect on January 1, 1970. As a result, the Falcon model name was used as the new price leader for the intermediate line. The 1970½ Falcon was available as a 2-door and 4-door sedan, and 4-door station wagon. These were the lowest priced intermediate models with less standard features than the Fairlane 500s. The Falcon was the only intermediate that used a rubber floor instead of carpet, and was the only series that offered a pillared 2-door sedan. Also introduced mid-year was a Torino 2-door SportsRoof model, which was marketed as a low price alternative to the GT. With the above mid-year additions, the Ford intermediate line-up consisted of 17 separate models.
The new body for 1970 added inches and pounds to the Torino resulting in stretching the chassis used in 1968–69. All cars grew by about in length, and now rode on a longer wheelbase (station wagons used a wheelbase). Weight was up for most models by at least . The wheel track was widened to in front and in the rear to help the Torino improve its road holding abilities. The extra width between the spring towers increased the engine compartment size allowing the larger 385 Series V8s to fit. However, the suspension remained unchanged from the 1969 models. Optional suspension packages included the competition suspension and heavy-duty suspension options. The competition suspension consisted of extra-heavy-duty front and rear springs ( per inch front, and per inch rear), Gabriel shocks (staggered rear shocks on 4-speed cars), and a large 0.95&quot; front sway bar (0.75&quot; standard on other suspensions). In a 1970 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; test of a Torino Cobra, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; described the competition suspension as &quot;completely different: The car goes through tight turns in a confidence-inspiring controlled slide. It&#x27;s all very smooth and unusual.&quot;

Interiors on the Torino were all new for 1970. The dashboard used a linear style speedometer centered on the driver and a new &quot;ribbon&quot; style tachometer was an option for V8 models. A temperature gauge was the only available gauge; oil pressure and electrics were monitored with warning lights only. High back bucket seats were available for all 2-door models, as was an optional console. All 2-door hardtop, SportsRoof and convertible models had &quot;DirectAire&quot; ventilation systems as a standard feature, which eliminated the need for side vent windows. The 2-door sedan, 4-doors and station wagons still had vent windows but the &quot;DirectAire&quot; system was an option for these models. The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, in compliance with Federal regulations. The steering wheel and column-mounted shifter locked when the key was removed.

The engine line-up received major changes, and only the 250 CID I-6, 302-2V and the 351W-2V were carried over from 1969. Most models continued used the 250 CID I-6 as the standard engine. Optional engines included the 302-2V (standard on GT and Brougham models), 351W-2V, the new 351 Cleveland available with a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor, and the new 429-4V 385 Series V8 (standard on the Cobra models). Selecting the 351-2V on the option list could have resulted in the buyer receiving either the 351W-2V or the 351C-2V; both shared the same power rating and VIN code. The 429-4V was available in three different versions. The first was the 429 Thunder Jet, the standard engine for the Cobra, rated at . Next was the 429 CJ (Cobra Jet), rated at , which included a 2-bolt main block, hydraulic lifters, a 700 CFM Holley or 715 CFM Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, and was available with or without Ram Air. The top option was the 429 SCJ (Super Cobra Jet), rated at , and was part of the &quot;Drag Pack&quot; option. Selecting the &quot;Drag Pack&quot; option turned a 429 CJ into a 429 SCJ. The drag pack required either the 3.91:1 or the 4.30:1 axle ratio, and included a 4-bolt main engine block, forged pistons, 780 CFM Holley carburetor, engine oil cooler, and a solid lifter cam. The &quot;Detroit Locker&quot; rear differential was included when the 4.30:1 axle was ordered while the &quot;Traction-Lock&quot; limited-slip differential was included with the 3.91:1 axle. Ram Air induction was optional on the 351C-4V, 429 CJ and 429 SCJ, but Ram Air did not change the advertised power ratings. The Ram Air option included a &quot;shaker hood&quot; where the scoop was attached to the top of the air cleaner assembly, and protruded through a hole in the hood. A 3-speed transmission was standard on all models except for the Cobra which came with a 4-speed as standard equipment. The Cruise-O-Matic was optional for all engines while the 4-speed transmission was available on all engines except the six and the 302-2V.

Torino Brougham models came standard with extra exterior and interior trim, finer upholsteries, wheel covers, unique emblems, extra sound insulation and &quot;Hideaway&quot; headlights. &quot;Hideaway&quot; headlights had headlight covers that were styled to look like the grille of the vehicle extended across the front end. When the lights were turned on, vacuum actuators would flip the covers up and out of the way to expose the quad headlamps. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; wrote that &quot;when you get into a Brougham, it&#x27;s the same feeling as an LTD, or even, dare we say it, a Continental. But in a more manageable scale.&quot; &quot;Motor Trend&quot; gave accolades to the 1970 Torino Brougham 2-door for its quiet interior that only allowed &quot;the muffled thump of freeway expansion-joints [to] intrude.&quot;

The Torino GT came standard with non-functional hood scoop molded into the hood, GT emblems (including the centre of the grille), dual colour-keyed sport mirrors, full width tail lights with a honeycomb effect (the centre portion was only reflective), black decklid appliques, and hub caps with wheel trim rings. Standard tires for the GT were E70-14 fibreglass belted tires, while convertibles wore F70-14s. Bucket seats and console were not longer standard equipment on the GT, but remained as options. Other new options for the Torino GT were a reflective laser stripe, which ran down the middle of the side of the Torino from the front fender to the door, and Hideaway headlamps. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine tested a 1970 Torino GT SportsRoof with a 429 CJ, C-6 Automatic, and 3.50:1 gears, and obtained a 0 – time of 6.0 seconds, while the quarter-mile took 14.4 seconds at .
The Torino Cobra remained the top performance model, but was a lower level of trim than the Torino GT. The Cobra was only available as a SportsRoof, and came standard with a 4-speed close ratio transmission, Hurst shifter, competition suspension, flat black hood and grille, 7-inch-wide wheels, F70-14 tires with raised white letters, twist style exposed hood latches and &quot;Cobra&quot; emblems. New options included Magnum 500 wheels with F60-15 tires and flat black &quot;Sport Slats&quot; for the rear window (both also available on the Torino GT). Performance was strong even though the Torino was heavier for 1970. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; tested a 1970 Torino Cobra equipped with the Ram Air , 429 CJ, C-6 automatic and 3.50:1 rear axle, and it went from 0 – in 6.0 seconds while taking 14.5 seconds at to go through the quarter-mile. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; wrote &quot;The weight obviously helped traction, as it was fairly easy to accelerate away from a standing start with only a modicum of wheelspin.&quot; &quot;Motor Trend&quot; also tested a 1970 Cobra with a 429 SCJ, 4-speed and 3.91:1 gears, and resulted in a 5.8-second 0 – time, with a 13.99-second quarter-mile at . &quot;Super Stock and Drag Illustrated&quot; bested that time, in their test of a Torino Cobra equipped with the , 429 SCJ, C-6 automatic, and 3.91:1 rear gears. They were able to run the quarter-mile in 13.63 seconds at , however, this was after the carburetor had been modified (improved power valve, larger primary and secondary jets). &quot;Super Stock and Drag Illustrated&quot; fitted a pair of slicks to the same Torino and ran a 13.39 seconds at .

Station wagon models for 1970 were offered initially in three different levels: the Fairlane 500 wagon, the Torino wagon, and the Torino Squire wagon. Mid-year 1970, the Falcon wagon became base station wagon. The sheetmetal on the station wagons was not changed as drastically as 2-door and 4-door models. The majority of the sheetmetal behind the front doors was carried over from the 1968–69 body style. As a result, the wagons appeared more upright and square than the sedans and coupes. The Torino Squire, the top level wagon, featured simulated woodgrain sides, headlamp covers and a trim level similar to the Torino Brougham sedan. The Squire came standard with a 302-2V V8 engine and power front disc brakes; other wagons had 4-wheel drums and the 250 CID I-6. All wagons used Ford&#x27;s &quot;Magic Doorgate&quot; two-way tailgate, but the power rear window, rear-facing third seat and roof rack were options. Ford offered a trailering towing package for all Torinos that would allow Torino to have a Class II tow rating (). This package included heavy-duty suspension, heavy-duty battery and alternator, extra cooling package, and power front disc brakes. The or engine, power steering and the Cruise-O-Matic transmission were required options.

Overall, 1970 was a successful year for Torino. It was a well received car by the automotive press and was selected as the Motor Trend Car of the Year for 1970. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; said the Torino was &quot;Not really a car line in the old sense, but a system of specialty cars, each for a different use... from luxury to performance.&quot; Ford produced 230,411 Torinos for 1970, along with 110,029 Fairlanes and 67,053 Falcons, for a total production of 407,493 units.

=== 1971 ===

For the 1971 model year, Ford limited changes to its intermediate line to minor revisions. The biggest change for 1971 was the decision to drop the Fairlane and Falcon model names. The Torino line-up consisted of 14 models. The base model was the &quot;Torino&quot;, available as a 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan and 4-door station wagon. Next was the mid-level &quot;Torino 500&quot;, available as a 2-door hardtop and SportsRoof, 4-door sedan and hardtop and a 4-door station wagon. The top-of-the-line Torino remained the &quot;Torino Brougham&quot;, available as a 2-door and 4-door hardtop, while the &quot;Torino Squire&quot; remained the station wagon equivalent to the Brougham. The &quot;Torino GT&quot; was offered as a 2-door SportsRoof and convertible, while the &quot;Torino Cobra&quot; was still only available as a 2-door SportsRoof.

The styling was mostly unchanged for the 1971 models, save for minor revisions to trim and the grilles. The grille on the 1971 Torinos was divided by a vertical division in the centre for all models except the Cobra. The Cobra used the same grille as the 1970 model. A revised emblem was located on the vertical grille divider for all Torinos except the Cobra. The Torino 500, Brougham, Squire wagon and GT models had the hideaway headlamp option available, which included a unique grille with a less prominent divider bar.

The engine line-up remained almost identical to the 1970 model year, with most models featuring the 250 CID I-6 as standard. Broughams, Squires and GTs continued to have the 302-2V as standard, while the Torino Cobra was downgraded to a 351-4V as its standard engine. All engines, other than the 429s, saw a slight drop in compression, which also resulted in a corresponding drop in power ratings. Other manufacturers were following suit, including Torino&#x27;s main competitor Chevrolet&#x27;s Chevelle, which had an even larger drop in compression on all of its 1971 engines. Ram Air induction was an option on the 351-4V, 429 CJ, and the 429 SCJ.
The Torino Cobra came with a 351-4V rated at and it also included a 4-speed manual with a Hurst shifter, F70-14 tires Cobra emblems, competition suspension, hub caps, and a blacked out grille. A new option for Cobra models was the reflective laser stripe, formerly an option for just GT models. Although the high-performance 429 Cobra Jets were still rated at the same power as the 1970 models, &quot;Super Stock and Drag Illustrated&quot; had disappointing results from its test of a 1971 Torino Cobra. They tested a Cobra equipped with the , 429 CJ, C-6 automatic, 3.50:1 gears, and were only able to turn a best quarter-mile time of about 15 seconds at . The article states &quot;this car would really respond to a good ignition system, a better intake manifold, a larger carburetor and a set of headers.&quot; &quot;Cars&quot; magazine had better luck with their test of a 1971 Torino Cobra equipped with the Ram Air , 429 CJ, C-6 automatic, and 3:50:1 gears. They went through the quarter-mile in 14.5 seconds at in the Torino. The former time was obtained after the &quot;Cars&quot; staff did some &quot;proper tuning.&quot;

The GT was the Torino&#x27;s sporty/high trim model and included a 302-2V engine, dual colour keyed racing mirrors, GT identification, a non-functional hood scoop, hub caps and trim, rings, chrome trim on the foot pedals, full width taillights with honeycomb effect, and E70-14 tires (F70-14 on convertibles). Torino GT&#x27;s had a shaker scoop when equipped with the Ram Air Induction. The Torino Brougham was Torino&#x27;s luxury oriented model. This model included Brougham ornamentation, additional trim, full wheel covers, additional sound proofing, and cloth upholstery. Hideaway headlamps were no longer standard, but remained an option. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; tested a 1971 Torino Brougham 4-door and stated &quot;The [seat] cushioning and support was excellent. ..[and] the upholstery was magnificent.&quot; 

Production for 1971 was 326,463 units, slightly lower than 1970 Ford intermediate production. Only 1,613 Torino GT Convertibles and 3,054 Torino Cobras were produced for 1971.


== Third generation (1972–1976) ==
=== 1972 ===

For 1972, the Torino was redesigned using many characteristics carried over from the previous generation. The 1972 Torino styling emphasized the &quot;long hood short deck&quot; look and had strong elements of coke bottle styling. The Torino line-up was revamped with three models &quot;Torino,&quot; &quot;Gran Torino&quot; and &quot;Gran Torino Sport.&quot; The most radical change was a large eggcrate grille in an oval opening on Gran Torinos. Tom McCahill stated, &quot;the gaping grille looks a little like it was patterned after Namu, the killer whale,&quot; but also stated that the Torino had &quot;kind of pleasing, no-nonsense styling.&quot; Gran Torinos had chrome bezels surrounding the headlamps on each side of the large oval grille. Base Torinos had a full width argent eggcrate grille that surrounded the headlights. Base Torinos also used a unique hood and front bumper differentiating it from the Gran Torino models. The Torino&#x27;s front fenders were flared around the wheel opening and the rear quarter panel had strong character line extending to the rear bumper. The windshield rake was increased to a faster 60-degree angle, while the A-pillars and roof were thinner. Despite these changes, structural integrity remained the same as 1971 models. A full width rear bumper had inset rectangular tail lights with pointed ends. &quot;DirectAire&quot; ventilation was standard equipment for all Torino models, resulting in vent windows vanishing. The Torino incorporated new safety features for 1972, including new flush mount door handles and side door guard rails.

The new model line-up reduced the number of models from 14 in 1971 to 9 in 1972. The convertible and 4-door hardtops were discontinued but all other body styles remained. The 4-door hardtops and sedans were replaced with 4-door &quot;pillared hardtops.&quot; This was Ford&#x27;s term for 4-door sedans with frameless door glass and a thin &quot;B&quot; pillar. This configuration was also used by station wagons. &quot;Torino&quot; remained the base series, but the mid-level Torino 500 was renamed &quot;Gran Torino&quot;. The Torino Brougham was reduced to an option package for the Gran Torino, and Torino GT became &quot;Gran Torino Sport.&quot; The Torino and Gran Torino were available as a 2-door hardtop and a 4-door sedan; the Gran Torino Sport was available as a 2-door hardtop and SportsRoof. The station wagon line-up consisted of three models: &quot;Torino,&quot; &quot;Gran Torino,&quot; and &quot;Gran Torino Squire&quot; with the simulated woodgrain on the exterior body panels. The Cobra model was discontinued as the Torino line was refocused toward luxury and de-emphasized performance.

The biggest change for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame construction from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design that was used to help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy-absorbing S-shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five cross members. The front suspension used a short/long control arm design, with a computer-selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, as in the fullsize Ford. The rear used a four-link suspension, which Ford called &quot;Stabul,&quot; with a computer-selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The wheel track increased by at least over 1971 models. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; stated the &quot;road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb&quot; in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, a heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy-duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino. Front disc brakes were standard equipment on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972. Gran Torino Squire station wagons had power brakes as standard equipment, but it remained an option for all other models. Further, it was a mandatory option for all powered models. The power steering was completely revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.

A significant change to Torino chassis for 1972 was the use of separate wheelbases for 2-doors and 4-doors. Starting in 1968, GM had begun to use a shorter wheelbase for its 2-door intermediates, and a longer one for the 4-doors. This allowed for stylists to make fewer compromises when trying to turn a 2-door into a 4-door. Chrysler also followed suit in 1971, although its intermediate coupes and sedans didn&#x27;t even share body panels. The 1972 Torino used a wheelbase for 2-doors and a wheelbase for 4-doors, station wagons, and the related Ranchero. Like GM intermediates, the Torino 2-door and 4-door shared many body panels. Overall, the size and weight for Torino had increased for 1972, following the longer, lower, wider trend. Gran Torino sedans saw a length increase, while 2-doors had a increase in length. Base Torino sedans were only longer, and 2-doors were shorter than 1971 models. Weight increased significantly for 4-door and station wagon models, while 2-doors had a small increase in weight.

Interiors were all new and featured an improved instrument panel, that used ABS plastic for much of its construction. The standard instrument cluster featured five equally sized round pods which contained a speedometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge, along with various warning lights. The leftmost pod was a vent for the &quot;DirectAire&quot; ventilation system. A clock was optional with the standard instrument package. The &quot;Instrumentation Group&quot;, available on all V8 models, featured two large round pods centered on the steering wheel, containing the speedometer (with trip odometer) and a tachometer. A third equal sized pod on the left contained the DirectAire vent. The instrument cluster included an ammeter, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge and clock set in a smaller stacked of pods near the centre of the instrument panel. The seats were also new for 1972, the standard front bench seat changed to a high back integrated headrest for the outboard seating positions, but high back bucket seats remained an option on 2-door models. Ford offered &quot;comfort weave&quot; vinyl inserts on the bucket seats for the last time in 1972. An optional 6-way power bench seat, replaced the 4-way seat offered in 1971.

The base engine was the inline-six in all models except the Gran Torino Squire station wagon and the Gran Torino Sport which used the 302-2V small-block V8. The engine options included the 302-2V, a 351-2V (&quot;Windsor&quot; or &quot;Cleveland&quot;), a 351C-4V &quot;Cobra Jet&quot; (CJ), a 400-2V, and a 429-4V. The 400-2V was a new engine to the Torino line-up, and was part of the 335 series engine family like the 351 Cleveland. The 429-4V was not a high-performance engine like the Cobra Jets of previous years; instead, it was a high torque, low revving engine. Emissions and low-lead fuel requirements had become more strict for 1972. To meet these requirements, compression ratios on all Torino engines were dropped to at least 8.5:1, and all engines ran on regular gasoline. These engines generally produced less power than their predecessors in 1971, although this was exaggerated due to the switch to the new SAE net bhp ratings from the SAE gross figures used in 1971. As a result, the power loss was not as dramatic as the numbers suggest, and the horsepower figures are not directly comparable. All models came equipped with a three-speed manual transmission as a standard equipment. The Cruise-O-Matic was optional, but was a mandatory option for the 351-2V, 400-2V and 429-4V. The 351-4V CJ required either the 4-speed or the Cruise-O-Matic transmissions as mandatory options.

The only performance engine for 1972 was the 351-4V CJ. The 351-4V CJ offered a number of performance enhancing features not offered on the 1970–71 351C-4V. It included a special intake manifold, modified camshaft, special valve springs and dampers, a 750 CFM Motorcraft Carburetor, 4-bolt main bearing caps and dual exhaust. Dual exhaust and the 4-speed transmission option were exclusive to the 351-CJ. A Ram Air Induction system was available briefly during the early model year, and could be equipped on 351 CJ and 429 powered cars. Performance from the 1972 351 CJ was competitive with the 1970–71 Torinos with the high compression 351-4V. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested a 351 CJ, 4-speed Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof with 3.50:1 gears to have a 0 – time of 6.8 seconds. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; did not publish its quarter-mile times, but &quot;Cars&quot; magazine tested a Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof with a 351 CJ, C-6 automatic, and 3.50 gears to run through the quarter-mile in 15.40 seconds.
The Gran Torino Sport was offered in two body styles: A 2-door formal hardtop and a 2-door SportsRoof. The Gran Torino Sport included an integrated hood scoop, twin colour-keyed racing mirrors, molded plastic door panels unique to the Sport model, body-side and wheel lip moldings, and F70-14 tires (E70-14 on hardtop models). A revised full body length laser stripe was an option for all Torino 2-door models. It replaced the chrome side moldings and was available in four colours to match the exterior paint. Ford offered an option package for the driving enthusiast called the &quot;Rallye Equipment Group.&quot; This grouped all the performance options together including the Instrumentation Group, Competition Suspension, G70-14 tires with raised white letters, and a Hurst shifter. The option group came standard with a 351CJ-4V and 4-speed but the 429-4V and the Cruise-O-Matic were optional. The competition suspension was highly regarded by Tom McCahill of &quot;Mechanix illustrated&quot;, as well as &quot;Motor Trend&quot; and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; as being less harsh than past Torino performance suspensions, while still offering excellent handling. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; described the suspension as &quot;Unlike the super heavy-duty springs of years past, the folks at Ford have managed to produce superior ride control without harshness. It takes a ride in one [Torino] to truly appreciate it.&quot;
Torino wagons grew much larger in 1972. Length increased by for Torino models, and for Gran Torinos. Wheelbase was up by , width increased by , and weight increased significantly. The extra width allowed Torino station wagons to carry a 4×8&#x27; sheet of plywood flat in the cargo area with the tailgate down. Station wagons had a rated capacity of , nearing the capacity of some full-size wagons. An available rear-facing third seat was available, increasing the wagon&#x27;s capacity from 6 to 8 passengers. All station wagons used the 3-way &quot;Magic Doorgate&quot; featuring for the first time a tailgate that could be opened as a door with the rear window up. A heavy-duty frame was standard equipment for all wagons. The Squire models came standard with a luggage rack and simulated woodgrain panels that were slightly translucent, allowing some of the paint tint to show through.

Torino wagons were often used to tow, but all Torino models could be equipped with one of two optional towing packages. A medium-duty trailer package for Class II towing allowed towing up to . This package included heavy-duty suspension, the extra-cooling package, trailer towing identification sticker and wiring harness. This option group required the 351-2V or larger engine. A heavy-duty Class III package included heavy-duty suspension, heavy-duty frame (standard on wagons), extra cooling package, heavy-duty battery and alternator, along with a 3.25:1 axle and trailer wiring. This package allowed the Torino to tow up to and required the 400-2V or larger engine and G78-14 or larger tires. Both towing packages listed an automatic transmission, power steering and brakes as mandatory options.

Overall, the 1972 Torino was a sales success and a total of 496,645 units were produced, making it the best-selling intermediate for 1972. This was the first time Ford had ever outsold the Chevrolet Chevelle since its 1964 introduction. The automotive press responded positively to the all new Torino, and it received generally positive reviews. In addition, &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; selected the Torino as a &quot;Best Buy&quot; for 1972.

The 1972 Ford Gran Torino Sport SportsRoof was featured in the 2008 movie &quot;Gran Torino&quot;, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood.
=== 1973 ===
The most obvious change for the 1973 model was a new front fascia, required to meet new federal regulations. The new regulation mandated that all cars manufactured after September 1, 1972, must be able to take a strike to the front without damaging safety related components such as headlamps and the fuel system. For 1973 only, rear bumpers had a requirement. The Torino&#x27;s front end featured totally new sheetmetal from the firewall forward, with a blunt, more squared-off fascia replacing the previous year&#x27;s pointed prow. The new large square energy absorbing bumper replaced the almost body-fitting chrome bumper used on the front of the 1972 Torino. The new larger bumpers caused all Torino models to increase in length by at least , and weight also increased by at least for all models. Rear bumpers and taillights were unchanged from 1972.

 Separate grille designs were still maintained for Torino and Gran Torino models; they mimicked the 1972s in design. The Gran Torino now had a more rectangular grill with the parking lamps horizontally placed in the grille, but the quad headlights were still surrounded with a chrome bezel. Base Torino models had a wider full width grill that surrounded the headlamps; however, the parking lamps were located on the outer edge of the fascia. The leading edge of the hood was squared off to follow the fascia&#x27;s lines, and all models shared the same hood. The 1973 Torino used the same rear bumper as the 1972 Torino, and incorporated minor changes to meet the mandate. Rear bumpers now had new brackets that increased the space between the bumper and the sheetmetal, an impact strip and bumper guards.

The model line-up for 1973 increased to 11 from the 9 models in 1972. The model line-up consisted of &quot;Torino&quot;, &quot;Gran Torino&quot;, &quot;Gran Torino Sport&quot;, and &quot;Gran Torino Brougham.&quot; The &quot;Gran Torino Brougham&quot; was available as a 2-door hardtop and a 4-door sedan. Other models were offered in the same body styles as 1972. Bench seats for 1973 reverted to low backs with separate head rests to increase rear visibility. The high back bucket seats were still available on the two-door models. The hood release was moved to inside for increased security. Two-door and four-door models used larger x rear drum brakes for 1973 to help cope with the extra weight; 1972 models used x drums. Radial tires were added to the option list which offered longer tread life and better road manners.

The standard engine remained the 250 CID inline-six for all models except the station wagons and Sport, which used the 302-2V. Engine options also remained the same, but all engines now had their compression ratio dropped to 8.0:1. Power for all engines was slightly lower than in 1972. The 351 CJ continued to be the only high-performance engine and only saw a drop from 1972. Police package Torinos had the same engine options as the civilian models but with the addition of a high-performance 460-4V exclusive to the &quot;Interceptor&quot; package.

 For 1973, Gran Torino Sport had its own unique emblem, which it displayed in the grille and on the trunk lock cover. The laser stripe was revised to a slightly different shape, and ran higher along on the body side. The Sport no longer had a hood scoop, and the Ram Air induction option was gone. The Sport was available as a 2-door SportsRoof or a 2-door hardtop but was otherwise unchanged from the 1972 model year. In the &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine road test of a 1973 Gran Torino Sport, the suspension was noted to be a good balance of comfort and handling. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; wrote that the Torino was as &quot;..quiet as a Jaguar, smooth as a Continental, the Torino&#x27;s ride is exceptional... even with the competition suspension.&quot; Their test of a SportsRoof equipped with the 351 CJ, C-6 automatic, and 3.25:1 gears, resulted in a 0 – time of 7.7 seconds while the quarter-mile went by in 16.0 seconds at . The 0 – 60 mph time was 0.9 seconds slower than the 1972 model &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested a year before; however, this can partially be attributed to differences in gear ratio, transmission type, and an almost increase in weight. The 1973 Sport had a test weight of , while the 1972 had a test weight of . For comparison, in a &quot;Motor Trend&quot; test of a 1970 Torino 2-door equipped with a 351-4V, Cruise-O-Matic, and 3.00:1 gears, they recorded a 0 – time of 8.7 seconds, and a quarter-mile time of 16.5 seconds at . However, the high compression 1970 motor required premium fuel, while the low compression 1973 motor could run on regular.

 The Gran Torino Brougham featured the most premium upholsteries in the Torino line-up, including nylon cloth fabrics and &quot;leather like&quot; vinyl. Standard equipment included a front bench seat with a fold down armrest, woodgrained trim on the instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, electric clock, bright pedal pad trim, and a dual note horn. The Squire wagon was trimmed similarly to the Brougham. Along the same genre, Ford introduced spring special option group called the Luxury Décor Package, in March 1973. This option package was available on 2-door Gran Torino models and included a white, brown, or green halo vinyl roof with colour-keyed body-side molding pinstripe package, colour keyed rear bumper pad and wheel covers, black sidewall radial tires, flight bench seat in tan super soft vinyl with matching door panels, deluxe 2-spoke steering wheel, wood tone instrument panel applique, dual note horn, 25-oz cut-pile carpet, and upgraded insulation. The Luxury Décor Package was only available with three exterior colours, saddle bronze, medium copper metallic or metallic ivy glow.

1973 was a successful year for the Torino, with 496,581 units being sold. The sales continued to be strong, even with the stiff competition from GM&#x27;s new for 1973 &quot;Colonnade&quot; intermediates. Torino was the number one selling intermediate and outsold its main competitor, the Chevrolet Chevelle, by over 168,000 units.
=== 1974 ===
The 1974 model year saw more extensive revisions to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a valance panel located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler was repositioned above the bumper, hidden behind an access door in the center of the taillight panel. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical rectangular sections. The grille had a fine mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections (embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens) and the grille emblem was changed The front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed while the bumper guards moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver&#x27;s side of the bumper. Base Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos except the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams had a red reflector panel between the taillamps to give them a full width look. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.

The Torino model line-up was the same as 1973, with two exceptions. The Gran Torino Sport was no longer available with the &quot;SportsRoof&quot; fastback roofline, and the new &quot;Gran Torino Elite&quot; debuted. Although 2-door Torinos were advertised as hardtops, the rear windows were revised to be fixed unlike the 1972–73 models. Ford announced to its dealers in January 1974 that new Gran Torino Elite, Ford&#x27;s entry in the mid-sized luxury car market, would be available for sale as of the week of February 18, 1974. The Elite was Ford&#x27;s response to Chevrolet&#x27;s popular low-priced luxury coupe the Monte Carlo. The Elite was described by Ford as &quot;A totally new 2-door hardtop... with Thunderbird-inspired styling, solid engineering and personal luxury... plus mid-size economy.&quot; The Elite wasn&#x27;t totally new, as Ford described, but it did have a number of unique features. The Elite used the Mercury Montego and Mercury Cougar body shell with unique front end styling that resembled the Thunderbird. It had a large eggcrate mesh grille surrounded by single headlamps recessed in chrome bezels and vertical wrap-around parking lamps. On the rear there was large wrap-around taillamps with a reflective center panel giving it a full width taillight appearance. Large color-keyed vinyl moldings were placed higher on the body side, similar to the Thunderbird. Standard equipment for the Elite included a 351-2V V8 engine, automatic transmission, and radial tires. It also featured standard luxury items such as a vinyl roof with twin opera windows, split bench seat, &quot;Westminster&quot; cloth upholstery, woodgrain trim, and complete instrumentation.

For 1974, Torino added several new luxury oriented options and features including a leather-wrapped steering wheel, split bench seat, an electric sunroof, rear fender skirts, speed control with steering wheel controls and opera windows for 2-doors. Opera windows were added as standard equipment on Brougham models. The exterior trim was revised, with moldings the rocker panels instead of the lower doors. Brougham and Sport models had an extra chrome molding that ran on the lower fender edge between the front wheelwell and bumper; this gave the appearance of bumper-to-bumper chrome. Squires had no lower body moldings. All 1974 Torinos used the seat belt-interlock system, as mandated by the U.S. government. This short-lived safety system would be removed after the 1974 model year. The competition suspension was no longer offered, and the only suspension option was a revised heavy-duty suspension package. This option was available on all Torinos except the Elite, and included a larger front sway bar and heavy-duty front and rear springs. Heavy-duty shocks and a rear sway bar were included in this package on 2-door and 4-door sedan models only.

Torinos were now even larger and heavier than ever before. All body styles were approximately 5&quot; longer due in part to the safety bumpers. With Torinos gaining weight and inches, the 250 CID I-6 was no longer the base engine. Nevertheless, even though original sales literature does not list the six cylinder engine as being available, &quot;Chilton&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Motor&#x27;s&quot; repair manuals list availability and data for 6-cylinder powered Torinos. That said, it appears that a small number of base model Torinos were built with the 250 CID 6-cylinder engine; in fact one of the 6-cylinder Torinos became the main car for the 2004 movie &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;. The 429-4V was replaced with the 460-4V which produced more power and torque and was equipped with dual exhaust. All other engines saw a slight increase in power levels compared to 1973. Other than the few six cylinder exceptions, all Torinos and Gran Torinos came with the 302-2V as the base engine, and the 3-speed manual remained the standard transmission. The larger V8 engine options required the Cruise-O-Matic as a mandatory option, except the 351-CJ. The 351-CJ remained the only performance engine, and it was limited to 2-door models. It produced more power than the 460-4V, and saw a increase but a loss of of torque. It was the only engine available with the 4-speed transmission but the more common Cruise-O-Matic was also available. This was the last model year for the 351 CJ and the four-speed transmission.

With the SportsRoof bodystyle discontinued, the Gran Torino Sport model was difficult to distinguish from other Gran Torino 2-doors. The Gran Torino Sport&#x27;s main identifiers were its unique emblems, with placement on the grille, the C-pillar, and the fuel filler door. In addition, a &quot;Sport&quot; script was placed by the C-pillar emblem. To further remove it from the sporty theme, Gran Torino Sports even had opera windows (on vinyl-roofed cars) and fender skirts added to its option list. Of note, when opera windows were ordered, the &quot;Sport&quot; script was placed below the &quot;Gran Torino&quot; nameplate on the fender and the C-pillar emblem was deleted. The laser stripe was no longer available, but a lower body multi-coloured non-reflective stripe was an option. Higher profile 78 series radial ply tires replaced the previously used 70 series bias-plys.

The interior of the Gran Torino Sport had more distinction from other models. The instrument package became a standard feature, but bucket seats remained an option. Bucket seats were revised to a low back design with separate head rests. Sport door panels, now vinyl rather than molded plastic, and seats were highlighted with coloured stripes, similar to the 1973 Luxury Décor Package interior. As a cost-cutting measure, the &quot;Magnum 500&quot; wheel was revised with the formerly chrome plated wheel replaced by a polished trim ring and argent painted spokes. Overall, performance was more lackluster for 1974 models. The 1974 Sport had a shipping weight almost heavier than a 1972 Sport.

Torino had another successful year in 1974, and continued to be popular. Ford produced 426,086 units, including 96,604 Gran Torino Elites.
=== 1975 ===
For the 1975 model year, the Ford Torino received a number of minor improvements, but was for the most part unchanged. The model line-up received only one change, the Gran Torino Elite was dropped. The Elite became an independent model, and marketed simply as the Ford Elite. All Torinos featured solid state ignition systems for 1975, which improved starting performance and fuel economy, while reducing maintenance costs. Radial tires, another fuel saving feature, power steering and power brakes were all new standard features for all Torinos. 1975 Torinos received a new steering wheel design and a &quot;Fuel Sentry&quot; vacuum gauge was added to the option list.

The 1975 model year saw virtually no changes to the exterior styling. The only significant change was that Torino models adopted the Gran Torino grille and front fascia. Torino&#x27;s weight continued to climb even though the exterior dimensions were unchanged from 1974.

The Federal Clean Air Act prompted Ford to install catalytic converters for 1975 to help meet the new emission standards. Installation of the converter increased exhaust back pressure resulting in significantly reduced the power output. In response, Ford revised the base engine on all Torinos to the 351-2V engine. Along with this change, the Cruise-O-Matic transmission became standard; no manual transmissions were available. Power for all engines, except the 460, was significantly reduced compared to 1974, and along with the weight increase, fuel economy and performance continued to decrease. The 400-2V and the 460-4V were the only engine options, as the 351-4V was no longer available.

The new 351M joined the line-up to replace the 351 Cleveland. Although, when a Torino was equipped with a 351-2V engine it could result in the car being delivered either the 351M or the 351W, as they were used interchangeably. The 351M and 351W had no appreciable power output difference. Due to the lack of emissions certification, the 351M was not available in California. The 351M used the 400&#x27;s tall deck block and shared its connecting rods and intake manifold, resulting in more parts shared between 351M and 400 compared to the 351C and 400. This saved Ford on the engine production costs.

The Gran Torino Sport remained but was virtually unchanged from the 1974 model. The Sport was almost indistinguishable from a conventional Gran Torino, and customers responded with a lack of interest. 1975 was the least popular and last year for this model; only 5,126 units were produced.

Sales for the Torinos dropped off significantly from the 1974 model year. With the Elite now a separate model, Torino lost a large portion of its sales. Ford produced only 195,110 Torinos for 1975. Even with the addition of the 123,372 Elites produced for 1975, total output was 318,482 which was still significantly lower than 1974. Sales decreases were likely due to the increased demand for smaller economical cars, while Ford&#x27;s more sensibly sized Granada likely also stole sales from Torino. The Ford Granada was classed as a compact by Ford, but had exterior dimensions close to that of a late 1960s Ford Torino.
=== 1976 ===
The 1976 model year saw no major changes to the Torino. The Gran Torino Sport was discontinued, and so the Torino consisted of 9 separate models; 2- and 4-door versions of the Torino, Gran Torino, and Gran Torino Brougham, along with three station wagon models. New options for the 1976 model year included a power trunk release and an automatic parking brake release. Gran Torino 2-doors could be ordered with the center console when optional bucket seats were specified; previously the console was only available on Sport models. In addition, opera windows and landau roofs were now available options for all 2-door models. There were no styling changes made to Torino for 1976.

Engine options remained the unchanged for 1976, however fuel economy was improved on all engines with revisions to the engine spark advance and the EGR valve operation. The 351-2V engines and the 400-2V had a power and torque increase, and the 460-4V had a power decrease. In an attempt to help improve fuel economy, the standard rear axle ratio for all models was now 2.75:1.

1975–1976 Gran Torinos were used in the popular Spelling-Goldberg Productions TV series &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;. The producers needed a flashy specialty car for the main characters to drive. Since Ford was the lease supplier for on-screen cars through their Studio-TV Car Loan Program, eventually it was decided by the producers that a bright red 1975 Gran Torino two-door would be the vehicle of choice for the pilot episode. To make the Torino less mundane, a large white vector stripe was added. Aluminum 5-slot mag wheels and larger rear tires replaced the stock wheels and tires, and air shocks were added to give the car an aggressive rake. The television show became quite popular with the public, and much of that popularity was centered on the star Torino. Ford couldn&#x27;t help but take notice to the public&#x27;s interest in the &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; Torino, and decided to introduce a replica version of the TV car.
Ford built 1,000 replicas of the &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; car in the spring of 1976. Production of the replicas began in March 1976, and all were produced in Ford&#x27;s Chicago manufacturing plant. This limited production package was essentially a special paint option, but required the deluxe bumper group and dual color-keyed sport mirrors as mandatory options. The TV car&#x27;s slotted mag wheels were not offered by Ford, and the only sporty wheel option was the Magnum 500 wheel. They were not a mandatory option though, and these cars came equipped with wheel covers as standard equipment. When producing the replicas, Ford painted the entire car white, then masked off the stripe and painted the rest of the car the shade of bright red (code 2B) used on the 1972–75 models (and subsequently the TV cars). This color had been discontinued for all other Torino models for 1976 in favor of a different shade of red. The factory replicas were close to the TV show car, but had minor differences in the stripe, and did not have the aggressive rake of the TV car. Many replica owners installed slotted mag wheels and air shocks after purchase to give the car a more authentic look. The &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; replica was available with all Torino engines. Seat colors were limited to black or white and were available with all seating trims and options. One of the factory replicas was leased to Spelling-Goldberg as a backup for the original Torinos that were created for the show.

Production total for the Torino in 1976 was 193,096 units, slightly lower than 1975. This would be the final year for the Ford Torino.

The Torino chassis continued to live on under the Ford LTD II, Ford Thunderbird, Ford Ranchero and Mercury Cougar through the 1977 to 1979 model years.

== Motorsport ==

The fastback roofline of the 1968–69 Ford Torinos provided a wind-cheating design that dominated NASCAR superspeedway racing. In 1969 Dodge responded with the Dodge Charger 500. This car was built with specific modifications to improve the aerodynamics of the car on the NASCAR track. In turn Ford added a special high-performance vehicle to its intermediate line-up, the Torino Talladega. This limited edition car was made specifically with NASCAR racing in mind and all of its modifications were to improve the aerodynamics of the Torino.

=== Torino Talladega ===

The Torino Talladega was equipped with unique front fascia that extended the length of the car by approximately . This front-end extension allowed Ford engineers to taper the front-end to reduce drag. The grille, which was normally recessed was made to be flush fitting, and the smoother rear bumper was reworked to fit the front. The rocker panels were rolled, which allow NASCAR teams to lower their race Talladegas by 5 inches (127 mm) legally.

The Talladega came only in the SportsRoof body style and in three colours: Wimbledon White, Royal Maroon, and Presidential blue. All had a flat black hood and a unique beltline pin stripe. The Talladega came standard with a 428 CJ (non-Ram Air), C-6 Cruise-O-Matic, staggered rear shocks (normally reserved for 4-speed cars) and 3.25:1 open differential. Talladegas were equipped with a cloth and vinyl bench seat, and used the Fairlane 500 body code like the 1969 Cobra. These cars could not be ordered with additional options, and only 743 Talladegas were produced.

The Talladega further improved Ford&#x27;s success rate on the NASCAR track. Dodge and Plymouth responded with the even more radical 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona and the 1970 Plymouth Superbird which used pointed nose cones and &quot;goalpost&quot; tail wings. Meanwhile, for those racing teams using Fords in 1970, some kept their 1969 Torinos when the new curvaceous 1970 models proved to be slower on the NASCAR track due to its less aerodynamic design.

=== Torino King Cobra ===

Ford planned to introduce another limited edition Torino to once again dominate at NASCAR. The result was the 1970 Ford Torino King Cobra. Like the Talladega, the King Cobra was modified with aerodynamics specifically in mind and looked very different from a typical 1970 Torino. It had a sloped front end with dual headlamps located in sugar scoop shaped cut-outs on the front fenders, similar in appearance to the Datsun 240Z. The King Cobra&#x27;s grille was a large opening below the front bumper, much like the bottom breather design now used in some modern cars. Parking lamps were located between the headlamps, molded into the front fascia. The hoods had a blacked-out center portion, and a side stripe similar to 1968–69 Torino GTs ran from the front fender to quarter panel. Ford planned to offer covers for the headlight cutouts to NASCAR teams to improve aerodynamics even further. In actuality it is said the front end created too much down force. In addition to no rear down force creation this caused the car to become very loose in turns as per Musclecar Review.

Due to NASCAR changing the homologation rules which increased the minimum number of cars produced for the public from 500 to 3,000 for a vehicle to qualify at NASCAR, and new Ford president Lee Iacocca, the King Cobra project was abandoned by Ford. It never saw a NASCAR track or a showroom and only three prototype cars were produced. One was equipped with the Boss 429 engine, only offered otherwise in the Boss 429 Mustang, one had the 429 SCJ, and one had a 429 CJ. The Torino King Cobra with the Boss 429 has been listed on eBay as of May 3, 2014, with a &quot;buy-it-now&quot; price of $599,999 (~$ in ).

== Engine specifications ==
== Venezuela ==

Ford built the Torino in Venezuela, but marketed it with the Fairlane name. The de luxe model was called Fairlane 500, and until 1974 it used the base Torino grille but Gran Torino trim on the body. Starting in 1974 this car was identical to the U.S. Gran Torino, and was available in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles.

== Collectibility ==

The 1970–71 Torino Cobras, the 1969 Torino Talladega, the 1970 King Cobra, the 1968–1971 Torino GT convertibles, and the 1969 Cobras are the most collectible Torino muscle cars. The 1972 body style has received notable exposure since the beginning of the 21st century with the release of the 2008 film &quot;Gran Torino&quot; (featuring a 1972 Gran Torino Sport and Clint Eastwood) and the 2009 film &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;. The 1974–76 body style was first popularized due to the 1970s television series &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, and revived with the release of the 2004 film &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;. As a result, the value of the 1974–76 Torinos has risen; still they are not the most valuable of the Torino body styles. However, the limited-edition factory replica Torino will likely be a valuable investment due to the series having a longtime cult following.

The lack of popularity and the low numbers of Torinos in existence today is likely due to the Torino&#x27;s durability issues that caused low survivability. Torinos had serious problems with chassis and body corrosion as well as having a less-than-perfect reliability record. In areas where severe winters exposed these cars to road salt, Torinos were reported to have major rust problems within the first 5 years of ownership. To further worsen the corrosion problems, 1969–1973 Torinos were reported to have severe paint-peeling problems. As a result, Torinos had the lowest resale value of any of the American intermediate cars in the 1970s used-car market.

<text>Cold is an American rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, formed in 1986 by lead singer and rhythm guitarist Scooter Ward, drummer Sam McCandless, bassist Jeremy Marshall and lead guitarist Matt Loughran. The band has gone through numerous lineup changes during its existence, with Ward being the band’s only constant member.

In 1997, at the urging of Fred Durst, Flip Records/A&amp;M Records signed Cold to a recording contract. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Cold&quot; (1998), sold poorly due to A&amp;M&#x27;s closure in the months following its release, resulting in the band moving to Geffen Records. Cold found mainstream success with &quot;13 Ways to Bleed on Stage&quot; (2000) and its follow-up &quot;Year of the Spider&quot; (2003), which saw the band incorporate influences of post-grunge and alternative rock into their sound; both albums were certified Gold by the RIAA, with the latter reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and producing the band&#x27;s only single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;. However, Cold would soon part ways with Geffen in March 2004 over disputes surrounding the promotion of &quot;Year of the Spider&quot;, and went through a succession of lineup changes throughout the rest of the year&quot;.&quot; 

Cold signed with Lava Records in July 2004, who released their fourth album, &quot;A Different Kind of Pain&quot; (2005); the album&#x27;s more sombre, downbeat tone alienated fans and subsequently failed to repeat the success of the band&#x27;s prior albums. After a period of uncertainty, Cold announced their disbandment In November 2006. In July 2008, it was announced that the original line-up would reunite for a tour in early 2009, which later spiralled into a fully fledged reunion. The band have since released two more studio albums; &quot;Superfiction&quot; in 2011, and their most recent album, &quot;The Things We Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;, in 2019.

==History==

===Early history (1986–1998) ===
Cold, who at the time were called Grundig, formed in 1986 with the line-up of Scooter Ward (vocals, rhythm guitar), Sam McCandless (drums), Jeremy Marshall (bass) and Matt Loughran (lead guitar) at Fletcher High School in Neptune Beach, Florida. The band played their first gig in 1990 at a club called the Spray. In 1992, the band released an 8-song EP called &quot;Into Everything&quot;. 

Initially based in Jacksonville, they moved to Atlanta hoping to get a break in the industry. During this time, Matt Loughran left the band and was replaced by Sean Lay, who also left the group. Kelly Hayes then joined, and they all later returned to Florida. Three and a half years later in 1995, Grundig broke up and Ward moved back to Jacksonville, where he, McCandless, Kelly Hayes, and Pat Lally formed the band Diablo. Diablo would only last about three months. At the end of that three-month period, Grundig reformed under the name Cold in 1996.

===Self titled album (1998–2000) ===

Following Cold&#x27;s progress in the Jacksonville scene was local Fred Durst. Impressed by what he had heard, he invited Ward to record two acoustic tracks, &quot;Check Please&quot; and &quot;Ugly.&quot; The two demos were passed on to producer Ross Robinson, who was also impressed by what he had heard, leading the recently renamed Cold to record their debut album titled &quot;Cold&quot; in 1997. 

In 1997, Cold was signed to Flip Records, with distribution through the major label A&amp;M Records. &quot;Cold&quot; was released in 1998, and received positive reviews from critics. However, shortly after its release, A&amp;M folded due to the Universal Music Group–PolyGram merger, resulting in the album&#x27;s promotion being suddenly cut, which hurt the album&#x27;s sales greatly; Flip Records&#x27; founder, Jordan Schur, described the album as being &quot;a car shut off in midgear&quot;, and thus only managed to sell just below 40,000 copies in the US. However, thanks to Schur, Cold avoided being dropped by UMG during the merger, and soon after Flip transferred the band&#x27;s contract over to Geffen Records, where Schur had just been named president of, in 1999. Regardless of the label&#x27;s poor promotion of the album, Cold soon opened for Limp Bizkit and Soulfly during a brief European tour in the spring of 1998.

That same year, the band released the &quot;Oddity EP&quot;. Its cover photo, taken by the wife of McCandless, depicts their pet tarantula named Wednesday, crawling on the face of her doll. The band sought a signature element that fans could remember them by, and Wednesday served as the inspiration; McCandless gave a particularly favorable image of a spider to a friend and tattoo artist who transformed it into what would become Cold&#x27;s official logo. The drummer would later note, &quot;Our music kind of creeps along like a spider.&quot;

===&quot;13 Ways to Bleed on Stage&quot; (2000–2002) ===

Geffen financed their second album titled &quot;13 Ways to Bleed on Stage&quot;, which was released on September 12, 2000. In 1999 before recording the album, the group recruited local guitarist Terry Balsamo, who briefly played for Limp Bizkit. With the new guitar addition Ward was now able to focus more on singing and interacting with the crowd. &quot;13 Ways to Bleed on Stage&quot; proved to be Cold&#x27;s breakthrough album with successful singles in &quot;End of the World&quot; and &quot;No One&quot; frequently played on hard rock radio, with &quot;No One&quot; hitting No. 17 on Mainstream Rock Tracks and No. 13 on Modern Rock Tracks, and the music video being put in heavy rotation on MTV2. The album included guest singer Aaron Lewis from Staind on the songs &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; and &quot;Bleed&quot; and singer Sierra Swan from Dollshead on &quot;No One&quot; and &quot;Witch&quot;. The song &quot;Just Got Wicked&quot; was also a surprise hit, being featured in the soundtrack to the game Jet Grind Radio and hitting No. 25 on Mainstream Rock tracks, which aided in the band&#x27;s popularity.

In April 2002, the band released &quot;Gone Away, &quot;a surprisingly moody ballad. The song first appeared on the &quot;WWF Tough Enough&quot; album and had a successful music video.

===&quot;Year of the Spider&quot; and split with Geffen (2002–2004)===
With the success of &quot;13 Ways to Bleed on Stage&quot;, Geffen financed their third major album titled &quot;Year of the Spider&quot;, which was released on May 13, 2003 (It was slated to release in October 2002, but was pushed back). The album has been to date the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard Album charts, with over 101,000 copies of the album sold in its first week of release.[] The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Stupid Girl,&quot; has been the only Cold single to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 87. Following the release of the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Suffocate&quot; to radio stations, plans were set-forth for a video to accompany the song. However, a music video was not made due to Geffen not giving approval. The stalemate with the label led to frustrations within the band, and in January 2004 Terry Balsamo departed, replacing Ben Moody in Evanescence. Balsamo was later replaced by ex-Darwin&#x27;s Waiting Room guitarist Eddie Randini, the following month.

In April 2004, guitarist Kelly Hayes quit the band as well. A week later, Hayes officially confirmed his position as the guitarist in the Jacksonville hard rock outfit Allele, a move that had been in the works from the time Terry Balsamo left the band. The band made efforts to release another single, &quot;Wasted Years&quot; from &quot;Year of the Spider&quot;. However, Geffen continued to not support the album any further.

Subsequently, in March 2004, Cold parted ways with Geffen. Around this time, Cold recorded the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy&quot; featuring the songs &quot;With My Mind&quot;, &quot;Came All the Way&quot; a b-side from Year of the Spider, &quot;Just Got Wicked (Chris Vrenna Remix)&quot;, and &quot;Go Away (Chris Vrenna Eye Socket Remix)&quot; and embarked on a short tour with Sevendust in support of &quot;With My Mind&quot;, the single released from the CD. They also performed at E3 to promote the game; however, the song was never released on any of their albums.

===Lava Records, &quot;A Different Kind of Pain&quot; and breakup (2004–2006)===

In May 2004, it was reported that Cold was considering signing with Lava Records, a division of Atlantic Records, with the band officially signing to the label that July. By September 2004, the band had added former member Matt Loughran and set about recording a new album. The album was to be produced by Elvis Baskette and slated to be released in December 2004. However, Cold suffered another blow with Eddie Rendini leaving the band on November 14, 2004. The new album was scheduled to be released in spring of 2005. Before releasing the album, Cold went back in the studio to record several more tracks. The album was originally to be titled &quot;And a Sad Song Lives On&quot; but was later changed to &quot;The Calm that Killed the Storm&quot;, and the release date was moved to September 13, 2005.

In June 2005, the band&#x27;s official website noted yet another change to the new album&#x27;s title, changing it to &quot;A Different Kind of Pain&quot;. &quot;Happens All the Time&quot; was the first single and video released. Just prior to shooting the video, the band added Las Vegas guitarist Mike Booth to the band. He would appear in the video and tour with them for a few months, being replaced later that fall by Florida-native Zac Gilbert. The album debuted at No. 26 on the Billboard Albums charts with more than 36,000 copies sold. &quot;A Different Kind of Pain&quot; was the beginning of a significant departure from the more radio-friendly alternative metal sound that was featured in the prior two albums. The title track was released as the second single, but Atlantic did not fund another video. The majority of &quot;A Different Kind of Pain&quot; was written in Ward&#x27;s sister&#x27;s bedroom while she battled cancer, and is said to have been the root of the subject matter on the album. Other subjects include the end of his relationship to his fiancée/mother of his daughter, and the physical abuse of a 14-year-old girl by her own father, and also had an alcoholic mother (a theme echoed from each of the three previous albums). The album has sold over 160,000 copies in the US.

On November 17, 2006, a MySpace post announced that Cold had decided to disband permanently. Ward announced that he and Sam McCandless had started a side-project called The Witch, later known as When November Falls and now known as The Killer and the Star. Shortly after forming, McCandless left the project.

===Reunion and &quot;Superfiction&quot; (2008–2012)===
On July 25, 2008, a blog written by Ward on The Killer and the Star&#x27;s MySpace confirmed both a b-sides/rarities release and a new Cold album featuring the original line-up, due Fall 2009.

In January 2009, Cold officially announced the first dates of its reunion tour on the band&#x27;s MySpace page. When the page was originally updated, the lineup consisted of Scooter Ward, Sam McCandless, Jeremy Marshall, Kelly Hayes and Terry Balsamo. Hayes was replaced by Joe Bennett, who parted ways with Cold in July 2009 and has been replaced by former Cold guitarist Zac Gilbert. Terry Balsamo was briefly replaced by Michael Harris of Idiot Pilot, who also played bass in The Killer and the Star. After the first tour in the spring, the band went out on the road again later that summer.

Cold confirmed on their site that the album had a release in mid-July 2011. Although initially dubbed the &quot;final album,&quot; Ward has said on &quot;Alternative Addiction&quot; that Cold will continue to record and tour after the 5th album comes out. The first official single from &quot;Superfiction&quot; was &quot;Wicked World&quot;.

&quot;Superfiction&quot; was released on July 18, 2011, through Eleven Seven. The album debuted at No. 37 on the Billboard 200 with 11,317 copies sold. The band had mentioned while touring that they would be including a live version of their song &quot;Snowblind&quot; as a hidden track on the new album, though many fans who have purchased the album noticed that there was no hidden track at all. &quot;Snowblind&quot; was released 8 years later, as a track on their sixth album, The Things That We Can&#x27;t Stop. The second single from the album, &quot;American Dream&quot;, was released on January 1, 2012. The music video for it was released through Eleven Seven official YouTube channel two weeks later.

===&quot;COLD:LIVE&quot; and departure of Jeremy Marshall (2012–2016)===
In November 2012, Scooter Ward revealed via Facebook that Cold was going to record an acoustic album of fan favorites from the first four albums, b-sides, rarities and four new songs in 2013. 
In April 2013, Ward reported that in addition to the acoustic record a double live album was set to be recorded in May 2013 in Jacksonville. Since then there was no news about the acoustic album with the recording of the live album being pushed back. 

On February 7, 2014, Cold started an Indiegogo campaign for the recording of the double live album and DVD, initially titled &quot;Live in Orlando&quot; and later renamed to &quot;COLD:LIVE&quot;. The campaign ended with 167% of the goal raised. On February 28, Cold played their first gig in almost three years in Central Florida Fair with Saliva. 

On April 28, 2014, the show date &amp; location for the Live DVD were announced - July 12, Jacksonville Beach, Florida. The band also performed a gig as Grundig on July 11, 2014, and re-recorded the 6-track live set (originally recorded at Furies in 1996) with intentions to release the record digitally. On July 12, 2014, the band played and recorded a live concert at University of North Florida Theater of 27 songs in total, including special piano/acoustic performances of &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, &quot;Bleed&quot;, &quot;Cure My Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Rain Song&quot; and special guest appearances such as Damien Starkey of Burn Season/Puddle of Mudd who performed &quot;Suffocate&quot; with the band onstage and drummer Ethan York who played on &quot;Just Got Wicked&quot;. 

On November 11, 2014, the band announced via Facebook that Jeremy Marshall left Cold to pursue another band called Fall to June and was replaced by Lindsay Manfredi. On January 30, 2015, former band member Eddie Rendini died. 

After much delay, &quot;COLD:LIVE&quot;, directed and edited by the band&#x27;s former guitarist Drew Molleur, was independently released by the band on January 27, 2016, on DVD, Blu-Ray and a double CD via their official site.

===Line-up changes, &quot;The Things We Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; and upcoming seventh studio album (2016–present)===
On March 13, 2015, it was announced that Cold signed the deal with Napalm Records to release a new album and play a worldwide tour in 2016. According to a post on Cold&#x27;s Facebook page on July 8, 2016, Terry Balsamo has returned to the band, and that they would begin recording their next album in August 2016.

On January 1, 2017, Nick Coyle (former singer of Lifer, myDownfall and The Drama Club) announced that he joined Cold as their new guitar player. It was later confirmed by the band. On January 11, 2017, Cold entered the studio to record their new album.

On January 14, 2018, vocalist Scooter Ward posted an update via the band&#x27;s Facebook page that the new album has undergone the final stages of production and they will announce the album title, artwork and release date by next month. He also announced new members Ethan York and Jonny Nova to round out the new lineup. Terry Balsamo and Sam McCandless would not be a part of the new album or tour, instead electing to pursue other commitments. McCandless was working on his new project The Cocky Bitches, along with his comic book ventures.

On June 27, 2019, Cold announced that &quot;The Things We Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;, their first album in eight years, would be released on September 13, 2019. The band later started their &quot;Broken Human Tour&quot; to promote the album. During the tour, McCandless returned to the band taking over York&#x27;s position and later re-joined the band full-time. The band also released music videos for &quot;Without You&quot; on September 18, 2019, followed by &quot;Run&quot; on December 19, 2019, and &quot;Quiet Now&quot; on April 1, 2020. The band later announced &quot;A Different Kind of Tour&quot; concerts in 2020 but was postponed due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The band would return to touring a year later, beginning in the fall of 2021. McCandless did not participate in the tour as he focused on his other ventures. Tony Kruszka would later join as their drummer in September 2021.

Cold announced that they would be touring in celebration of the 20th anniversary of &quot;Year of the Spider&quot; from March - May 2023. Prior to the tour, Coyle and Nova left the band on February 14, 2023 to pursue their musical ventures with Death Valley Dreams. Ed Cuozzo and Angelo Maruzzelli of University Drive joined as guitarists. Cold would later add more dates for their &quot;Year of the Spider&quot; 20th anniversary tour through September 2023; playing only east coast dates for this leg of the tour. The band has also been working on new material for their seventh studio album.
The band would later announce a tour in celebration of both &quot;13 Ways to Bleed on Stage&quot; and &quot;A Different Kind of Pain&quot; from April - June 2025.

<doc id="316926" wikidata="Q520819" url="?curid=316926" title="Lex Barker">
<text>Alexander Crichlow Barker Jr. (May 8, 1919 – May 11, 1973), known as Lex Barker, was an American film and television actor. He was known for playing Tarzan for RKO Pictures between 1949 and 1953, and portraying leading characters from Karl May&#x27;s novels, notably as Old Shatterhand in a film series by the West German studio Rialto Film. At the height of his fame, he was one of the most popular actors in German-speaking cinema, and received Bambi Award and Bravo Otto nominations for the honor.

==Early life==
Barker was born in Rye, New York, the second child of Alexander Crichlow Barker Sr., a wealthy Canadian-born building contractor and stockbroker, and his American wife, the former Marion Thornton Beals. He had an elder sister, Frederica Amelia &quot;Freddie&quot; Barlow (1917–1980). Of English and Spanish ancestry, Barker was a direct descendant of the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and of Sir William Henry Crichlow, historical governor-general of Barbados.

Raised in New York City and Port Chester, New York, he attended the Fessenden School and graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, where he played football and the oboe. He attended Princeton University, but dropped out to join a theatrical stock company, much to his family&#x27;s chagrin.

==Career==

===Theatre===
Barker made it to Broadway once, in a small role in a short run of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; in 1938. He also had a small role in Orson Welles&#x27;s disastrous &quot;Five Kings&quot;, which met with so many problems in Boston and Philadelphia that it never made it into New York City.

===World War II===
In February 1941, 10 months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Barker left his fledgling acting career and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He rose to the rank of major during the war. He was wounded in action (in the head and leg) fighting in Sicily. He was awarded the Purple Heart twice.

===Early film roles===
Back in the US he recuperated at a military hospital in Arkansas, then upon his discharge from service traveled to Los Angeles. Within a short time he landed a small role in &quot;Doll Face&quot; (1945), his first film.

A string of small roles followed in films such as &quot;Two Guys from Milwaukee&quot; (1945) and &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; (1946).

===RKO===
Barker signed a contract at RKO. He had small roles in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1947), &quot;Crossfire&quot; (1947), and &quot;Under the Tonto Rim&quot; (1947).

Barker went to Paramount Studios for &quot;Unconquered&quot; (1947). Back at RKO he was in &quot;Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome&quot; (1947), &quot;Berlin Express&quot; (1948), &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; (1948), &quot;The Velvet Touch&quot; (1948), and &quot;Return of the Bad Men&quot; (1948), playing Emmett Dalton.

===Tarzan===
In &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Magic Fountain&quot; (1949), Barker became the 10th official Tarzan of the movies. His blond, handsome, and intelligent appearance, as well as his athletic 6&#x27;4&quot; frame, helped make him popular in the role Johnny Weissmuller had made his own for 16 years. His Jane was Brenda Joyce, who had been in Weissmuller&#x27;s last three films.

Barker&#x27;s second Tarzan movie was &quot;Tarzan and the Slave Girl&quot; (1950), where Jane was played by Vanessa Brown. In &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Peril&quot; (1951), Barker&#x27;s Jane was Virginia Huston, with African location footage. Dorothy Hart was Jane in &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Savage Fury&quot; (1952), directed by Cy Endfield.

Barker got the chance to play a non-Tarzan role in &quot;Battles of Chief Pontiac&quot; (1952), a Western. He returned to the role one last time in &quot;Tarzan and the She-Devil&quot; (1953).

===Westerns===
Barker supported Randolph Scott in &quot;Thunder Over the Plains&quot; (1953).

At Universal he starred in the Western &quot;The Yellow Mountain&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Man from Bitter Ridge&quot; (1955). He went to Columbia to make &quot;Duel on the Mississippi&quot; (1955).

Barker had a rare non-Western role in &quot;The Price of Fear&quot; (1956), a film noir with Merle Oberon. He was in the war movie &quot;Away All Boats&quot; (1956) and the thriller &quot;The Girl in the Kremlin&quot; (1957).

Barker made two films for Howard W. Koch: &quot;War Drums&quot; (1957) and &quot;Jungle Heat&quot; (1957). He went to 20th Century Fox for &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; (1957), then did &quot;The Girl in Black Stockings&quot; (1957).

===Italy===
In 1957, as he found it harder to find work in American films, Barker moved to Europe (he spoke French, Italian, Spanish, and some German), where he found popularity and starred in over 40 European films, including two movies based on the novels by Italian author Emilio Salgari (1862–1911).

He started his European career with a British thriller &quot;The Strange Awakening&quot; (1958). He went to Italy to star in &quot;Captain Falcon&quot; (1959), &quot;Son of the Red Corsair&quot; (1959), &quot;The Pirate and the Slave Girl&quot; (1959), and &quot;Terror of the Red Mask&quot; (1960).

Barker had a short but compelling role as Anita Ekberg&#x27;s fiancé in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960).

He went back to swashbucklers: &quot;Knight of 100 Faces&quot; (1960), &quot;Pirates of the Coast&quot; (1960), &quot;Robin Hood and the Pirates&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Secret of the Black Falcon&quot; (1961).

===West Germany===
Barker had his greatest success in West Germany. There, he starred in movies based on the &quot;Doctor Mabuse&quot; stories (formerly filmed by Fritz Lang), in the movies &quot;The Return of Doctor Mabuse&quot; (1961). He was in &quot;Doctor Sibelius&quot; (1962).

Barker then played Old Shatterhand in an adaptation of the novel by popular German author Karl May (1842–1912), &quot;Treasure of the Silver Lake&quot; (1962). It was a huge hit, and 11 movies adapting stories by Karl May followed until 1968. Barker did the comedy &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot; (1962), then the adventure movie &quot;Storm Over Ceylon&quot; (1963). He returned to Italy for &quot;The Executioner of Venice&quot; (1963) and &quot;Kali Yug: Goddess of Vengeance&quot; (1963).

Barker reprised his role as Old Shatterhand in &quot;Apache Gold&quot; (1964), &quot;Old Shatterhand&quot; (1964), and &quot;Last of the Renegades&quot; (1965). He went to South Africa for Harry Alan Towers&#x27; West German-British international co-production &quot;Victim Five&quot; (1964), then returned to West Germany for other adaptations of May books: &quot;The Treasure of the Aztecs&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Pyramid of the Sun God&quot; (1965) . &quot;24 Hours to Kill&quot; (1965) was a British movie. &quot;The Hell of Manitoba&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Desperado Trail&quot; (1966) were Westerns.

Though Barker did speak German, he was almost always dubbed in his West German films. His go-to dubber was Gert Günther Hoffmann, whose distinctive voice contributed to Barker&#x27;s success.

In 1966, Barker was awarded the &quot;Bambi Award&quot; as Best Foreign Actor in West Germany, where he was a very popular star. He even recorded two songs in German: &quot;Ich bin morgen auf dem Weg zu dir&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll be on the way to you tomorrow&quot;, composed by Martin Böttcher, the composer of some of the soundtracks of the Karl May movies) and &quot;Mädchen in Samt und Seide&quot; (&quot;Girl in Silk and Velvet&quot;, composed by Werner Scharfenberger).

His later films included &quot;Killer&#x27;s Carnival&quot; (1966), and &quot;Winnetou and the Crossbreed&quot; (1967). In the same year, he starred in a Eurospy film &quot;Spy Today, Die Tomorrow&quot; and a horror film &quot;The Blood Demon&quot;, and appeared in the anthology film &quot;Woman Times Seven&quot; (1967).

He returned to the United States occasionally and made a handful of guest appearances on American television episodes, but Europe, and especially West Germany, was his professional home for the remainder of his life.

==Personal life==

Barker was married five times:
* Constance Rhodes Thurlow (1918–1975) (married June 27, 1942–divorced 1950), a daughter of Leon Rhodes Thurlow, a vice president of the Decorated Metal Manufacturing Company. They had one daughter, Lynn Thurlow Barker (April 11, 1943 – 2010), and a son, Alexander &quot;Zan&quot; Crichlow Barker III (March 25, 1947 – October 2, 2012). In 1952, Constance Barker married her second husband, John Lawrence Adams, a descendant of John Quincy Adams.
* Actress Arlene Dahl (married 1951–divorced 1952)
* Actress Lana Turner (married September 8, 1953–divorced July 22, 1957). Turner&#x27;s daughter Cheryl Crane later accused Barker of having repeatedly raped her when she was between the ages of 10 ½ and 13. and that this was the reason for the breakup of the marriage. According to Crane, to avoid public scandal, no charges were ever filed. 
* Irene Labhardt (married 1957–1962; her death from leukemia), a Swiss actress. They had one son, Christopher (born 1960), who became an actor and singer.
* Tita Cervera (married 1965–divorced 1972, although divorce not deemed legally valid), a Spanish beauty-pageant winner. Voted Miss Spain in 1962, she later became the wife of movie producer Espartaco Santoni in 1975 (the marriage turned out to be bigamous) and later still, in 1985, the fifth and final wife of billionaire art collector Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza.

==Death==
Barker died on May 11, 1973, of a heart attack, three days after his 54th birthday, while walking down Lexington Avenue on New York City&#x27;s Upper East Side to meet his fiancée, actress Karen Kondazian. The funeral was held in New York. He was cremated and the ashes were taken by his estranged wife Tita to Spain.

<text>The triple bottom line (or otherwise noted as TBL or 3BL) is an accounting framework with three parts: social, environmental (or ecological) and economic. Some organizations have adopted the TBL framework to evaluate their performance in a broader perspective to create greater business value. Business writer John Elkington claims to have coined the phrase in 1994.

==Background==
In traditional business accounting and common usage, the &quot;bottom line&quot; refers to either the &quot;profit&quot; or &quot;loss&quot;, which is usually recorded at the very bottom line on a statement of revenue and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and social justice advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of bottom line into public consciousness by introducing full cost accounting. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from asbestosis, and their copper mine pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money on health care and river clean-up, how can we capture a fuller societal cost benefit analysis? The triple bottom line adds two more &quot;bottom lines&quot;: social and environmental (ecological) concerns. With the ratification of the United Nations and ICLEI TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007, this became the dominant approach to public sector full cost accounting. Similar UN standards apply to natural capital and human capital measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting ecological footprint. Use of the TBL is fairly widespread in South African media, as found in a 1990–2008 study of worldwide national newspapers.

An example of an organization seeking a triple bottom line would be a social enterprise run as a non-profit, but earning income by offering opportunities for handicapped people who have been labelled &quot;unemployable&quot;, to earn a living by recycling. The organization earns a profit, which is invested back into the community. The social benefit is the meaningful employment of disadvantaged citizens, and the reduction in the society&#x27;s welfare or disability costs. The environmental benefit comes from the recycling accomplished. In the private sector, a commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) implies an obligation to public reporting about the business&#x27;s substantial impact for the better of the environment and people. Triple bottom line is one framework for reporting this material impact. This is distinct from the more limited changes required to deal only with ecological issues. The triple bottom line has also been extended to encompass four pillars, known as the quadruple bottom line (QBL). The fourth pillar denotes a future-oriented approach (future generations, intergenerational equity, etc.). It is a long-term outlook that sets sustainable development and sustainability concerns apart from previous social, environmental, and economic considerations.

The challenges of putting the TBL into practice relate to the measurement of social and ecological categories. Despite this, the TBL framework enables organizations to take a longer-term perspective and thus evaluate the future consequences of decisions.

==Definition==
Sustainable development was defined by the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations in 1987. Triple bottom line (TBL) accounting expands the traditional reporting framework to take into account social and environmental performance in addition to financial performance.

In 1981, Freer Spreckley first articulated the triple bottom line framework in a publication called &quot;Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative Working&quot;. In this work, he argued that enterprises should measure and report on financial performance, social wealth creation, and environmental responsibility. The phrase &quot;triple bottom line&quot; was articulated more fully by John Elkington in his 1997 book &quot;Cannibals with Forks: the Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business&quot;, where he adopted a question asked by the Polish poet Stanisław Lec, &quot;Is it progress if a cannibal uses a fork?&quot; as the opening line of his foreword. Elkington suggests that it can be, particularly in the case of &quot;sustainable capitalism&quot;, wherein competing corporate entities seek to maintain their relative position by addressing people and planet issues as well as profit maximisation.

A &quot;Triple Bottom Line Investing&quot; group advocating and publicizing these principles was founded in 1998 by Robert J. Rubinstein.

For reporting their efforts companies may demonstrate their commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) through the following:

*Top-level involvement (CEO, Board of Directors)
*Policy Investments
*Programs
*Signatories to voluntary standards
*Principles (UN Global Compact-Ceres Principles)
*Reporting (Global Reporting Initiative)

The concept of TBL demands that a company&#x27;s responsibility lies with stakeholders rather than shareholders. In this case, &quot;stakeholders&quot; refers to anyone who is influenced, either directly or indirectly, by the actions of the firm. Examples of stakeholders include employees, customers, suppliers, local residents, government agencies, and creditors. According to the stakeholder theory, the business entity should be used as a vehicle for coordinating stakeholder interests, instead of maximizing shareholder (owner) profit. A growing number of financial institutions incorporate a triple bottom line approach in their work. It is at the core of the business of banks in the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, for example.

The Detroit-based Avalon International Breads interprets the triple bottom line as consisting of &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Community&quot;, and &quot;Employees&quot;.

===The three bottom lines===

The triple bottom line consists of social equity, economic, and environmental factors. The phrase, &quot;people, planet, and profit&quot; to describe the triple bottom line and the goal of sustainability, was coined by John Elkington in 1994 while at SustainAbility, and was later used as the title of the Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell&#x27;s first sustainability report in 1997. As a result, one country in which the 3P concept took deep root was The Netherlands.

==== People, the social equity bottom line ====
The people, social equity, or human capital bottom line pertains to fair and beneficial business practices toward labour and the community and region in which a corporation conducts its business. A TBL company conceives a reciprocal social structure in which the well-being of corporate, labour and other stakeholder interests are interdependent.

An enterprise dedicated to the triple bottom line seeks to provide benefit to many constituencies and not to exploit or endanger any group of them. The &quot;up streaming&quot; of a portion of profit from the marketing of finished goods back to the original producer of raw materials, for example, a farmer in fair trade agricultural practice, is a common feature. In concrete terms, a TBL business would not use child labour and monitor all contracted companies for child labour exploitation, would pay fair salaries to its workers, would maintain a safe work environment and tolerable working hours, and would not otherwise exploit a community or its labour force. A TBL business also typically seeks to &quot;give back&quot; by contributing to the strength and growth of its community with such things as health care and education. Quantifying this bottom line is relatively new, problematic and often subjective. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has developed guidelines to enable corporations and NGOs alike to comparably report on the social impact of a business.

==== Planet, the environmental bottom line ====
The planet, environmental bottom line, or natural capital bottom line refers to sustainable environmental practices. A TBL company endeavors to benefit the natural order as much as possible or at the least do no harm and minimize environmental impact. A TBL endeavour reduces its ecological footprint by, among other things, carefully managing its consumption of energy and non-renewables and reducing manufacturing waste as well as rendering waste less toxic before disposing of it in a safe and legal manner. &quot;Cradle to grave&quot; is uppermost in the thoughts of TBL manufacturing businesses, which typically conduct a life cycle assessment of products to determine what the true environmental cost is from the growth and harvesting of raw materials to manufacture to distribution to eventual disposal by the end user.

Currently, the cost of disposing of non-degradable or toxic products is born financially and environmentally by future generations, the governments, and residents near the disposal site and elsewhere. In TBL thinking, an enterprise which produces and markets a product which will create a waste problem should not be given a free ride by society. It would be more equitable for the business which manufactures and sells a problematic product to bear part of the cost of its ultimate disposal.

Ecologically destructive practices, such as overfishing or other endangering depletions of resources are avoided by TBL companies. Often environmental sustainability is the more profitable course for a business in the long run. Arguments that it costs more to be environmentally sound are often specious when the course of the business is analyzed over a period of time. Generally, sustainability reporting metrics are better quantified and standardized for environmental issues than for social ones. A number of respected reporting institutes and registries exist including the Global Reporting Initiative, CERES, Institute for Sustainability and others.

The ecological bottom line is akin to the concept of eco-capitalism.

==== Profit, the economic bottom line ====
The profit or economic bottom line deals with the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs, including the cost of the capital tied up. It therefore differs from traditional accounting definitions of profit. In the original concept, within a sustainability framework, the &quot;profit&quot; aspect needs to be seen as the real economic benefit enjoyed by the host society. It is the real economic impact the organization has on its economic environment. This is often confused to be limited to the internal profit made by a company or organization (which nevertheless remains an essential starting point for the computation). Therefore, an original TBL approach cannot be interpreted as simply traditional corporate accounting profit &quot;plus&quot; social and environmental impacts unless the &quot;profits&quot; of other entities are included as a social benefit.

==Subsequent development==

Following the initial publication of the triple bottom line concept, students and practitioners have sought greater detail in how the pillars can be evaluated. The &quot;people&quot; concept, for example, can be viewed into three dimensions – organisational needs, individual needs, and community issues.

Equally, &quot;profit&quot; is a function of both a healthy sales stream, which needs a high focus on customer service, coupled with the adoption of a strategy to develop new customers to replace those that die away, and &quot;planet&quot; can be divided into a multitude of subdivisions, although reduce, reuse and recycle is a succinct way of steering through this division.

The initial understanding is now supplanted by thinking beyond TBL: added to the TBL concept of economics, ethics and environment is the idea of thinking of the environment as a mantel that the other pillars hold up, and add to Economics and Ethics, the notions of Energy, and Health or the 4 E&#x27;s.

==Supporting arguments==

The following business-based arguments support the concept of TBL:

*Reaching untapped market potential: TBL companies can find financially profitable niches which were missed when money alone was the driving factor. Examples include:

# Adding ecotourism or geotourism to an already rich tourism market such as the Dominican Republic
# Developing profitable methods to assist existing NGOs with their missions such as fundraising, reaching clients, or creating networking opportunities with multiple NGOs
# Providing products or services which benefit underserved populations and/or the environment which are also financially profitable.

*Adapting to new business sectors: While the number of social enterprises is growing, and with the entry of the B Corp movement, there is more demand from consumers and investors for an accounting for social and environmental impact. For example, Fair Trade and Ethical Trade companies require ethical and sustainable practices from all of their suppliers and service providers.

Government fiscal policies usually claim to be concerned with identifying social and natural deficits on a less formal basis. However, such choices may be guided more by ideology than by economics. The primary benefit of embedding one approach to measurement of these deficits would be first to direct monetary policy to reduce them, and eventually achieve a global monetary reform by which they could be systematically and globally reduced in some uniform way.

The argument is that the Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity is at risk, and that in order to avoid catastrophic breakdown of climate or ecosystems, there is need for comprehensive reform of global financial institutions similar in scale to what was undertaken at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.

With the emergence of an externally consistent green economics and agreement on definitions of potentially contentious terms such as full-cost accounting, natural capital and social capital, the prospect of formal metrics for ecological and social loss or risk has grown less remote since the 1990s.

In the United Kingdom in particular, the London Health Observatory has undertaken a formal programme to address social deficits via a fuller understanding of what &quot;social capital&quot; is, how it functions in a real community (that being the City of London), and how losses of it tend to require both financial capital and significant political and social attention from volunteers and professionals to help resolve. The data they rely on is extensive, building on decades of statistics of the Greater London Council since World War II. Similar studies have been undertaken in North America.

Studies of the value of Earth have tried to determine what might constitute an ecological or natural life deficit. The Kyoto Protocol relies on some measures of this sort, and actually relies on some value of life calculations that, among other things, are explicit about the ratio of the price of a human life between developed and developing nations (about 15 to 1). While the motive of this number was to simply assign responsibility for a cleanup, such stark honesty opens not just an economic but political door to some kind of negotiation — presumably to reduce that ratio in time to something seen as more equitable. As it is, people in developed nations can be said to benefit 15 times more from ecological devastation than in developing nations, in pure financial terms. According to the IPCC, they are thus obliged to pay 15 times more per life to avoid a loss of each such life to climate change — the Kyoto Protocol seeks to implement exactly this formula, and is therefore sometimes cited as a first step towards getting nations to accept formal liability for damage inflicted on ecosystems shared globally.

Advocacy for triple bottom line reforms is common in Green Parties. Some of the measures undertaken in the European Union towards the Euro currency integration standardize the reporting of ecological and social losses in such a way as to seem to endorse in principle the notion of unified accounts, or unit of account, for these deficits.

To address financial bottom line profitability concerns, some argue that focusing on the TBL will indeed increase profit for the shareholders in the long run. In practice, John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, uses Whole Foods&#x27; Community Giving Days as an example. On days when Whole Foods donates 5% of their sales to charity, this action benefits the community, creates goodwill with customers, and energizes employees, which may lead to increased, sustainable profitability in the long-run.

Furthermore, planning a sustainability strategy with the triple bottom line in mind could save companies a lot of money if a disaster were to strike. For example, when BP spilled &quot;two hundred million gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico&quot;, it cost the company &quot;billions&quot;. This company focused mostly on the financial and economic costs of this disaster, instead of the company’s environmental bottom line, furthering damage to the company and its reputation.

==Adoption==
Timothy Slater and Tanya Hall identified General Electric (GE), Unilever, Procter and Gamble, 3M and a private company, Cascade Engineering, as examples of businesses using TBL. GE referred to TBL benefits associated with their electron beam emitting technology investment in 2008. Danish company Novo Nordisk&#x27;s consolidated financial statements for 2019 were supplemented by a &quot;consolidated social statement&quot; and a &quot;consolidated environmental statement&quot;.

==Criticism==
While many people agree with the importance of good social conditions and preservation of the environment, there are also many who disagree with the triple bottom line as the way to enhance these conditions. The following are the reasons why:

* &quot;Reductive method&quot;: Concurrently the environment comes to be treated as an externality or background feature, an externality that tends not to have the human dimension build into its definition. Thus, in many writings, even in those critical of the triple-bottom-line approach, the social becomes a congeries of miscellaneous considerations left over from the other two prime categories. Alternative approaches, such as Circles of Sustainability, that treat the economic as a social domain, alongside and in relation to the ecological, the political and the cultural are now being considered as more appropriate for understanding institutions, cities and regions.
* &quot;Inertia&quot;: The difficulty of achieving global agreement on simultaneous policy may render such measures at best advisory, and thus unenforceable. For example, people may be unwilling to undergo a depression or even sustained recession to replenish lost ecosystems. 
* &quot;Application&quot;: According to Fred Robins&#x27; &quot;The Challenge of TBL: A Responsibility to Whom?&quot; one of the major weaknesses of the TBL framework is its ability to be applied in the practical world.
* &quot;Equating ecology with environment&quot;: TBL is seen to be disregarding ecological sustainability with environmental effects, where in reality both economic and social viability is dependent on environmental well-being. While greenwashing is not new, its use has increased over recent years to meet consumer demand for environmentally friendly goods and services. The problem is compounded by lax enforcement by regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the Competition Bureau in Canada, and the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice in the United Kingdom. Critics of the practice suggest that the rise of greenwashing, paired with ineffective regulation, contributes to consumer skepticism of all green claims, and diminishes the power of the consumer in driving companies toward greener solutions for manufacturing processes and business operation.
* &quot;Time dimension&quot;: While the triple bottom line incorporates the social, economical and environmental (People, Planet, Profit) dimensions of sustainable development, it does not explicitly address the fourth dimension: time. The time dimension focuses on preserving current value in all three other dimensions for later. This means assessment of short term, longer term and long term consequences of any action.
*&quot;One problem with the triple bottom line is that the three separate accounts cannot easily be added up. It is difficult to measure the planet and people accounts in the same terms as profits—that is, in terms of cash.&quot; This has led to TBL being augmented with cost-benefit analysis in Triple Bottom Line Cost Benefit Analysis (TBL-CBA).
* &quot;Performance/eco-efficiency&quot;: According to Rambaud, A. &amp; Richard, J., &quot;the TBL model [...] is based on the concept of ‘eco-efficiency’. In his seminal book, Elkington [...] gives a fundamental role to eco-efficiency in constructing the TBL model. According to him, the development of the concept of eco-efficiency allowed the development of the TBL model, a framework that he believes can save businesspeople from ecological communism&quot;. Eco-efficiency is equivalent to weak sustainability and corresponds to a relative measure of socio-environmental impacts compared to value creation. In this, eco-efficiency differs from eco-effectiveness, which is concerned with the absolute measurement of these impacts. A company can therefore increase its socio-environmental impacts and increase its eco-efficiency, if at the same time it increases its value creation even more. The TBL is thus the dedicated reporting system structuring this notion of performance at the expense of eco-effectiveness. Yet eco-efficiency is at the heart of rebound effects and cannot be a credible basis for ecosystem management in particular. 
*Elkington himself has called for a rethink on TBL and a &quot;product recall&quot; on use of the concept. He argues that the original idea was to encourage businesses to manage the wider economic, social and environmental impacts of their operations, but its practical use as an accounting tool has now undermined its value. More precisely, he explains &quot;It [Triple Bottom Line] was supposed to provoke deeper thinking about capitalism and its future, but many early adopters understood the concept as a balancing act, adopting a trade-off mentality. [...] Such experimentation [de la TBL] is clearly vital — and typically sparks a proliferation of potential solutions. But the bewildering range of options now on offer can provide business with an alibi for inaction. Worse, we have conspicuously failed to benchmark progress across these options, on the basis of their real-world impact and performance&quot;.

In short, the criticisms can be summarised as:
* attempting to divert the attention of regulators and deflating pressure for regulatory change;
* seeking to persuade critics, such as non-government organisations, that they are both well-intentioned and have changed their ways;
* seeking to expand market share at the expense of those rivals not involved in greenwashing; this is especially attractive if little or no additional expenditure is required to change &quot;performance&quot;; alternatively, a company can engage in greenwashing in an attempt to narrow the perceived &#x27;green&#x27; advantage of a rival;
* reducing staff turnover and making it easier to attract staff in the first place;
* making the company seem attractive for potential investors, especially those interested in ethical investment or socially responsive investment;
* inability to add up the three accounts unless tools such as cost-benefit analysis or eco-efficiency (weak sustainability performance) are added to put social and environmental externalities in monetary terms.

In response to these limitations, the concept of the &quot;Triple Depreciation Line&quot; (also called &quot;CARE - Comprehensive Accounting in Respect of Ecology - model&quot;) has been proposed.

==Legislation==
A focus on people, planet and profit has led to legislation changes around the world, often through social enterprise or social investment or through the introduction of a new legal form, the Community Interest Company. In the United States, the BCorp movement has been part of a call for legislation change to allow and encourage a focus on social and environmental impact, with BCorp a legal form for a company focused on &quot;stakeholders, not just shareholders&quot;.

In Western Australia, the triple bottom line was adopted as a part of the State Sustainability Strategy, and accepted by the Government of Western Australia but its status was increasingly marginalised by subsequent premiers Alan Carpenter and Colin Barnett.

<text>Eric Berne (May 10, 1910 – July 15, 1970) was a Canadian-born psychiatrist who created the theory of transactional analysis as a way of explaining human behavior.

Berne&#x27;s theory of transactional analysis was based on the ideas of Freud and Carl Jung but was distinctly different. Freudian psychotherapists focused on talk therapy as a way of gaining insight to their patient&#x27;s personalities. Berne believed that insight could be better discovered by analyzing patients’ social transactions.

==Background and education (1927–1938)==
Eric Berne was born on May 10, 1910, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, as Eric Lennard Bernstein. He was the son of David Hillel Bernstein, MD, a general practitioner, and Sarah Gordon Bernstein, a professional writer and editor. His only sibling, his sister Grace, was born five years later. The family immigrated to Canada from Poland and Russia. Both parents graduated from McGill University in Montreal. Eric was close to his father and spoke fondly of how he accompanied his father on rounds, traveling by horse-pulled sleigh on cold Montreal winters to visit patients.

Berne&#x27;s father died of tuberculosis when Berne was 11. His mother then supported herself and her two children working as an editor and writer. She encouraged her son to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and to study medicine. Berne received his baccalaureate degree in 1931 and an M.D. and C.M. (Master of Surgery) from McGill University Medical School in 1935.

Berne came to the United States in 1935 when he began an internship at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. After completing his one-year internship in 1936, he began his psychiatric residency at the Psychiatric Clinic of Yale University School of Medicine, where he worked for two years.

In 1939, Berne became an American citizen and shortened his name from Eric Lennard Bernstein to Eric Berne.

In 1949, he was admitted as a Fellow in the American Psychiatric Association.

==Career (1938–1970)==

From 1938 to 1940, Berne was an assistant physician at Ring Sanitarium, Arlington Heights, Massachusetts.

From 1940 to 1943 he was employed as a psychiatrist in a sanitarium in Connecticut, and concurrently as a clinical assistant in psychiatry at Mt Sinai Hospital in New York. He also maintained a private practice.

In 1943, during World War II, Berne joined the United States Army Medical Corps and served as a psychiatrist. He rose from the rank of Lieutenant, to Captain, and then to Major. His assignments included Spokane, Washington, Ft. Ord, California and Brigham City, Utah.

After his discharge in 1946, Berne settled in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. He lived in a four-bedroom, three bath Victorian house on the eastern side of Carpenter Street, in the second house located south from 2nd Avenue. The house dates back to 1888, originally built for surveyor Davenport Bromfield while he mapped the streets of Carmel City. It is one of the oldest structures in town, now listed on the Carmel Inventory Of Historic Resources as the &quot;Eric Berne House.&quot; From 1949 to 1964, Berne had a private practices in both Carmel and San Francisco and kept up a demanding pace of research, teaching in addition.

Berne resumed his psychoanalytic training that he had begun in New York City, prior to the War, at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Society and Institute. During 1947–1949 Berne studied under Erik Erikson. He took an appointment in 1950 as Assistant Psychiatrist at Mt. Zion Hospital, San Francisco, and simultaneously began serving as a Consultant to the Surgeon General of the US Army. In 1951, he accepted a position of Adjunct and Attending Psychiatrist at the Veterans Administration and Mental Hygiene Clinic, San Francisco.

The years from 1964 to 1970 were restless ones for Berne. His personal life became chaotic and he concentrated on his writing.

==Transactional analysis==
Berne created the theory of transactional analysis as a way to explain human behavior. Berne&#x27;s theory was based on the ideas of Freud but his were distinctly different. Freudian psychotherapists focused on patient&#x27;s personalities. Berne believed that insight could be better discovered by analyzing patients’ social transactions. Berne mapped interpersonal relationships to three ego-states of the individuals involved: the &quot;Parent, Adult&quot;, and &quot;Child&quot; state. He then investigated communications between individuals based on the current state of each. He called these interpersonal interactions &quot;transactions&quot; and used the label &quot;games&quot; to refer to certain patterns of transactions which popped up repeatedly in everyday life.

The origins of transactional analysis can be traced to the first five of Berne&#x27;s six articles on intuition, which he began writing in 1949. Even at this early juncture and while still working to become a psychoanalyst, his writings challenged Freudian concepts of the unconscious.

In 1956, after 15 years of psychoanalytic training, Berne was refused admission to the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute as a fully-fledged psychoanalyst. He interpreted the request for several more years of training as a rejection and decided to walk away from psychoanalysis.
Before the end of the year, he had written two seminal papers, both published in 1957. 
#In the first article, &quot;Intuition V: The Ego Image&quot;, Berne referenced P. Federn, E. Kahn, and H. Silberer, and indicated how he arrived at the concept of ego states, including his idea of separating &quot;adult&quot; from &quot;child&quot;. 
#The second paper, &quot;Ego States in Psychotherapy&quot;, was based on material presented earlier that year at the Psychiatric Clinic, Mt. Zion Hospital, San Francisco, and at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Clinic, U.C. Medical School. In that second article, he developed the tripartite scheme used today (Parent, Adult, and Child), introduced the three-circle method of diagramming it, showed how to sketch contaminations, labeled the theory, &quot;structural analysis&quot;, and termed it &quot;a new psychotherapeutic approach&quot;.

A few months later, he wrote a third article, titled &quot;Transactional Analysis: A New and Effective Method of Group Therapy&quot;, which was presented by invitation at the 1957 Western Regional Meeting of the American Group Psychotherapy Association of Los Angeles. With the publication of this paper in the 1958 issue of the American Journal of Psychotherapy, Berne&#x27;s new method of diagnosis and treatment, transactional analysis, became a permanent part of the psychotherapeutic literature. In addition to restating his concepts of ego states and structural analysis, the 1958 paper added the important new features of transactional analysis proper (i.e. the analysis of transactions), games, and scripts.

His seminar group from the 1950s developed the term &quot;transactional analysis (TA)&quot; to describe therapies based on his work.
By 1964, this expanded into the International Transactional Analysis Association. While still largely ignored by the psychoanalytic community, many therapists have put his ideas in practice.

In the early 1960s he published both technical and popular accounts of his conclusions. His first full-length book on TA was published in 1961, titled &quot;Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy&quot;. &quot;Structures and Dynamics of Organizations and Groups&quot; (1963) examined the same analysis in a broader context than one-on-one interaction.

==&quot;Games People Play&quot;==

&quot;Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships&quot; is a bestselling 1964 book by Berne that has sold more than five million copies. The book describes both functional and dysfunctional social interactions.

The essence of games described by Berne are that they are not zero-sum games (i.e. one must win at the other&#x27;s expense), where the person who benefits from a transaction wins the game. On the contrary, the &quot;games people play&quot; usually pay all of the players off, even those who ostensibly are the losers, since they are about psychic equilibrium or promoting adopted self-damaging social roles instead of rational benefits. These payoffs are not consciously sought by the players but they are leading to the ultimate unconscious life script of each as set by their parental family interactions and favored emotions.

Despite having been written for professional therapists, the book became a New York Times bestseller and made Berne famous. The book clearly presented everyday examples of the ways in which human beings are caught up in the games they play. Berne gave these games memorable titles such as &quot;Now I&#x27;ve Got You, You Son of a Bitch&quot;, &quot;Wooden Leg&quot;, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You... / Yes, But...&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s You and Him Fight&quot;.

Berne said that &quot;any social intercourse (…) has a biological advantage over no intercourse at all&quot;, so, people need any form of &quot;stroking&quot; (a physical contact, e.g., exchange) to live.

==Name and pseudonyms==

In 1943 he changed his legal name from Eric Lennard Bernstein to Eric Berne.

Berne had an irrepressible sense of humour, which was particularly evident in his writing. For example, in his article entitled &quot;Who was condom?&quot; Berne wrote about the contraceptive, the condom, and whether a man named &quot;Condom&quot; ever existed. While at McGill he wrote for several student newspapers using pseudonyms. He continued to write under pseudonyms such as Cyprian St. Cyr (&quot;Cyprian Sincere&quot;) in whimsical articles in the &quot;Transactional Analysis Bulletin&quot;.

==Personal life==
Berne was married three times. His first wife was Ruth Harvey (the Jorgensen biography used the pseudonyms of &quot;Elinor&quot; and &quot;McRae&quot; to protect the privacy of Berne’s first wife). They married in 1942, had two children, and divorced acrimoniously in 1945. In 1949 he married Dorothy DeMass Way, with whom he also had two children before their divorce in 1964. After his popular success, Eric married a third time, to Torre Peterson in 1967. The couple took up residence in Carmel, California, where he wrote, but he continued some clinical work in San Francisco. This marriage also ended in divorce, in early 1970.

==Death==
Berne died of a heart attack in Carmel on July 15, 1970. He was 60 years old.

<text>Et-Tell () or [[Khirbet]] et-Tell (also meaning &quot;heap of ruins&quot;) is an archaeological site in the West Bank, commonly identified with the biblical city of Ai.

==Location==
The site of et-Tell is just beside the modern village of Deir Dibwan and about 3 km east of Beitin (ancient Bethel), atop a watershed plateau overlooking the Jordan Valley and the city of Jericho 14 km east.

==Settlement phases==

===Early Bronze I===
The earliest settlement phase known at et-Tell, called &quot;Pre-Urban&quot;, coincides with the Early Bronze Age I (EBI) and lasted from about 3200 to 3100 BC. In this period, an unfortified village (about 200 m in diameter, large for the EBI) was settled at the site, with accompanying tombs dug in caves on the northeastern slopes of the hill. Pottery styles from this period show both indigenous and foreign cultural influences and may signify a mingling of peoples from nearby areas and newcomers immigrating from more distant regions. Over time, the foreign elements tended to predominate over indigenous ones.

About 3100 BC, et-Tell entered the &quot;Urban A&quot; phase. A large, well-planned walled city, about 110,000 square metres (~11 ha) in area, was built on the site. Some notable buildings from this time include a great acropolis complex consisting of a temple-palace compound, a market and residential area, and four fortified city gates. Sometime between 2950 and 2860 BC, the Urban A city was brought to an end by violent destruction. Most of the main buildings were burned to the ground; a layer of scorched stones and ash covers the floors of the EBI buildings.

===Early Bronze II (2950/2860–2720 BC)===
Following this destruction, the city was rebuilt and entered into the &quot;Urban B&quot; phase, which coincides with the Early Bronze II (EBII) period. Buildings were repaired and modified, and the fortifications were strengthened. Two distinctive new pottery shapes that first appear in this period suggest that new leadership was imposed on the city; these newcomers may also have been responsible for the destruction of the Urban A/EBI settlement.

The Urban B city, like its forerunner, was destroyed violently by fire. Excavations uncovered the ruins of buildings, collapsed stones and beams at every site investigated. Fire trapped under the debris of collapsed roofs smoldered hotly enough to change the chemical composition of the stone, a process called calcination. The walls of the compound on the acropolis were tilted and displaced by a rift in the bedrock, suggesting that an earthquake may have been responsible for the destruction. This happened around 2720 BC, based on carbon-14 dating.

===Transitional EB II–III Hiatus (c. 2720–2700/2680 BC)===
Following this destruction, the city lay in ruins for some time. Erosion channels cut through the debris; based on their depth and spread, the city was most likely abandoned for between 20 and 40 years.

===Early Bronze III===
Finally, in the Early Bronze Age III (EBIII), et-Tell was rebuilt and entered the &quot;Urban C&quot; phase. Egyptian influence in this stage is evident, attested by the use of stone pillars shaped with copper saws as well as other typically Egyptian building techniques. Two gates in the city wall, along with a great open reservoir designed to capture rainwater, are known.

Around 2550 BC, there was a temporary disruption at the site, based on damage and rebuilding to the fortifications and major changes in the temple area. Finally, about 2400 BC, complete destruction again overtook the site. Callaway has proposed that a local Canaanite ruler may have managed to conquer the city away from the Egyptians, following which it was destroyed in an Egyptian counterattack.

===Hiatus (2400–1200 BC)===
After the destruction of the &quot;Urban C&quot; layer, et-Tell was abandoned and lay in ruins for over a thousand years.

===Iron Age I===
The next settlement period did not begin until the Iron Age I, about 1200 BC, when a wave of settlers came and peacefully began a new occupation there. This new village was unfortified and took up only a small region of the mound, smaller by far than the Early Bronze cities. This level is marked by the digging of rock-cut cisterns into the hill to catch rainwater and the use of terrace farming on the slopes of the mound. The discovery of farming tools and great quantities of animal bones in every house suggests that these people were both farmers and shepherds. About 1050 BC, this village was abandoned without burning or destruction.

===Iron Age II===
During the Iron II era, the city was linked with the kingdom of Geshur, of which it was a major centre.

There are indications, as of 2016, that the archaeologists are close to locating the 10th-century BCE, that is: Geshurite, city gate. The et-Tell site would have been easily the largest and strongest city to the east of the Jordan Valley during Iron II era.

Imposing archaeological finds here date also to the post-Geshurite 8th century BCE. It is often linked with the city of Bethsaida.

==Excavation history==
The first archaeological exploration of et-Tell was undertaken in September 1928 under the supervision of John Garstang. Eight trenches were dug, five against the outer side of the southern city wall and three within the city itself. The outcome of this excavation was never formally published, and the only report known is a three-page summary filed by Garstang at the end of the work. In a later book, Garstang claimed that Late Bronze Age pottery, dating to c. 1400 BC, was found in this excavation, but this pottery was not mentioned in his earlier summary of the work and cannot now be located.

The next excavation at et-Tell took place during three seasons between 1933 and 1935 and was led by Judith Marquet-Krause, with backing from Baron Edmond de Rothschild. A fourth season of excavation was cut short by Marquet-Krause&#x27;s untimely death in July 1936; however, her husband compiled a catalog of objects found in the excavation and published it in 1949. This campaign concentrated on the upper region of the mound and exposed regions of the acropolis and a village dating to the Iron Age.

The most recent campaign at et-Tell, the Joint Archaeological Expedition, was undertaken in nine seasons from 1964 to 1970 and overseen by Joseph Callaway and the American Schools of Oriental Research. Eight new sites were opened at et-Tell in areas next to Marquet-Krause&#x27;s expedition and along the lower east city walls, and three smaller sites in the neighborhood were surveyed to create a more whole archaeological profile of the region.

==Comparisons with biblical Ai==
Edward Robinson suggested in 1838 that et-Tell could be the location of the biblical city of Ai, as did Charles Wilson in 1866, on the evidence of biblical references and nearby topography. This identification was backed by the American scholar William Foxwell Albright, who further argued in a 1924 paper that the site of et-Tell held the ruins of a great Canaanite city, corresponding with the biblical tradition that the Israelite commander Joshua &quot;burnt Ai and made it a heap for ever&quot; (). Another point in favor of this hypothesis is that the Hebrew word &quot;Ai&quot; means &quot;the ruin&quot;, which is more or less the same meaning as the modern Arabic name, et-Tell. Albright&#x27;s identification has been accepted by the majority of the archaeological community, and today et-Tell is widely believed to be one and the same as the Biblical Ai.

If et-Tell is indeed Ai, this poses a problem for defenders of the literal historicity of the biblical accounts concerning the origin of ancient Israel. The reason for this is that traditional dating schemes place the Exodus from Egypt and Joshua&#x27;s conquest around 1400 BC. In this version of events, Joshua and the invading Israelites are depicted as conquering Ai, killing its residents and burning the city; however, et-Tell was unoccupied at this time according to the established archaeological chronology, and the later Iron Age I village appeared with no evidence of initial conquest. The Iron I settlers seem to have peacefully built their village on the forsaken mound, without meeting resistance.

One proposal to resolve this difficulty holds that the Bible&#x27;s description of Ai, whose Hebrew name הָעַי means &quot;the ruin&quot;, seems to imply that it was indeed a ruined settlement at the time of the Israelite conquest. Ralph K. Hawkins has proposed that Ai was destroyed by Joshua in a scaled-down attack against the Cannanite people who were living in the ruins of the previous Middle Bronze Age city.

<doc id="316935" wikidata="Q1147934" url="?curid=316935" title="Pulcinella">
<text>Pulcinella (; ) is a classical character that originated in commedia dell&#x27;arte of the 17th century and became a stock character in Neapolitan puppetry. Pulcinella&#x27;s versatility in status and attitude has captivated audiences worldwide and kept the character popular in countless forms since his introduction to commedia dell&#x27;arte by in 1620.

His visual appearance includes a humpback, a crooked nose, gangly legs, a potbelly, large cheeks, and a gigantic mouth. These traits were inherited from two stock characters of the Atellan Farce. He typically wears a pointed hat (conical hat). When depicted as a member of the upper class, Pulcinella is a cunning thief and schemer. When depicted as a member of the servant class, Pulcinella is a perverted bumpkin. In either case, he is a social climber, striving to rise above his station in life. He is an opportunist who always sides with the winner in any situation and who fears no consequences. His main motivations are self-interest and self-preservation, yet Pulcinella tends to rescue other characters from trouble. He is said to be every character&#x27;s savior, despite acting as a rebel and a delinquent.

==Characteristics==
Pulcinella embodies the Neapolitan plebeians, the simplest man who occupies the bottom place on the social scale, the man who, although aware of his problems, always manages to come out of them with a smile.

Pulcinella represents the soul of the people and its primitive instincts. He almost always appears in contradiction, so much so that he does not have fixed traits. He may be rich or poor, a bully or a coward—sometimes exhibiting both traits simultaneously. In addition to being a faithful servant, he adapts to all trades: baker, innkeeper, farmer, thief, seller of miraculous concoctions.

His movements are broad and laborious, allowing him to aggressively emphasize his speech while simultaneously exhausting him. He will also get excited about something and move very quickly and deliberately, leaving him with no choice but to halt the action to catch his breath. He is to be thought of as a rebellious delinquent in the body of an old man.

The quality that best distinguishes Pulcinella is his , with which he manages to solve the disparate problems that arise in front of him—always, however, in favor of the weakest at the expense of the powerful.

Another famous characteristic of his is that of never being able to shut up; from this trait comes the expression in several European languages &quot;Pulcinella&#x27;s secret&quot; (i.e., an open secret that everyone knows).

Pulcinella&#x27;s repertoire is full of movements, gestures, acrobatics, and dances rooted in Neapolitan culture. Among his accessories are the broom, the horn, and the cowbells, all of which Neapolitans consider charms against the evil eye and bad luck.

Pulcinella has his origins in two stock characters of the ancient Roman Atellan Farce, Maccus and Bucco. Maccus is described as being witty, sarcastic, rude, and cruel, while Bucco is a nervous thief who is as silly as he is full of himself. This duality manifests itself in both how Pulcinella is shaped and the way he acts.

Physically, the characteristics Pulcinella has inherited from his ancestors contribute to his top-heavy, bird-like shape. His humpback, his large, crooked nose, and his gangly legs come from Maccus, while his potbelly, large cheeks, and gigantic mouth come from Bucco.

Due to this duality of heredity, Pulcinella can be portrayed as either a servant or a master, depending on the scenario. &quot;Upper&quot; Pulcinella is more like Bucco, with a scheming nature, an aggressive sensuality, and great intelligence. &quot;Lower&quot; Pulcinella, however, favors Maccus, and is described by Pierre Louis Duchartre as being &quot;a dull and coarse bumpkin&quot;. This juxtaposition of proud, cunning thief from the upper class and loud, crass pervert from the servant class is key to understanding Pulcinella&#x27;s behaviors.

Pulcinella is a character: he either plays dumb, although he is very much aware of the situation, or he acts as though he is the most intelligent and competent one on the stage, despite being woefully ignorant. He incessantly attempts to rise above his station while not intending to work for it. He is a social who tries to get those below him to think highly of him but is quick to appease the powerful. 

Pulcinella&#x27;s closing couplet translates to: &quot;I am Prince of everything, Lord of land and main. Except for my public whose faithful servant I remain.&quot; However, because his status is often that of a servant, he has no real investment in preserving the socio-political world of his master. He is always on the side of the winner, although he often does not decide this until after they have won. No matter his initial intent, Pulcinella always manages to win. If something ends poorly, another thing is successful. If he is put out in one sense, he is rewarded in another. This often accidental triumph is his norm.

Another important characteristic of Pulcinella is that he fears nothing. He does not worry about consequences as he will be victorious no matter what. It is said that he is so wonderful to watch because he does what audience members would do were they not afraid of the consequences.
Pulcinella is the ultimate self-preservationist, looking out for himself in most every situation, yet he still manages to sort out the affairs of everyone around him. Antonio Fava, a world-renowned maskmaker and Maestro of commedia dell&#x27;arte, is particularly fond of the character in both performance and study due to Pulcinella&#x27;s influence and continuity throughout history. Fava explains that, &quot;Pulcinella, a man without dignity, is nevertheless indispensable to us all: without [him] ... none of his countless &#x27;bosses&#x27; could ever escape from the awkward tangle of troubles in which they find themselves. Pulcinella is everyone&#x27;s saviour, saved by no one.&quot; This accidental helpfulness is key to his success. He goes out of his way to avoid responsibility, yet always ends up with more of it than he bargained for.

== Mask ==
Traditionally made of leather, Pulcinella&#x27;s mask is either black or dark brown, to imply weathering from the sun. His nose varies in shape, but it is always the most prominent feature of the mask. It can be long and curved, hooking over the mouth, or it can be shorter with a more bulbous bridge. Either way, the nose is designed to resemble a bird&#x27;s beak. There is often a wart somewhere on the mask, typically on the forehead or nose. Furrowed eyebrows and deep wrinkles are also important, although there is room for artistic interpretation. He can have a protruding brow ridge, knitted brows, a furrowed brow, or simply raised eyebrows, as long as they are prominent enough to match the exaggerated style of commedia dell&#x27;arte masks. The mask used to feature a bushy black mustache or beard, but this was mostly abandoned after the 17th century.

== Costume and props ==

Pulcinella is most often portrayed in a white ensemble consisting of wide-legged trousers and a long-sleeved, loose-fitting blouse with buttons down the front. The outfit is completed by a belt that cinches below the waist, giving Pulcinella a place to hold props while emphasizing his pot belly. A white hat is always worn, typically either a skull cap, a hat with turn-up brim, a soft conical hat whose point lies down, or a . The sugar-loaf hat gained popularity in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

Pulcinella has two main props. The first is a cudgel, a relatively short stick used primarily as a weapon. He calls this his &quot;staff of credit&quot;. His other prop is a coin purse, traditionally attached to his belt so as to stay close to his body.

== Etymology ==
A plausible theory derives his name from the diminutive (or combination with &#x27;rooster&#x27;)) of Italian (&#x27;chick&#x27;), on account of his long beaklike nose, as theorized by music historian Francesco Saverio Quadrio, or due to the squeaky nasal voice and &quot;timorous impotence&quot; in its demeanor, according to Giuseppe (Joseph) Baretti.

According to another version, &quot;Pulcinella&quot; derived from the name of Puccio d&#x27;Aniello, a peasant of Acerra, who was portrayed in a famous picture attributed to Annibale Carracci, and was characterized by a long nose. It has also been suggested that the figure is a caricature of a sufferer of acromegaly.

== Variants ==

Many regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character diffused across Europe. From its east to west coasts, Europeans strongly identified with the tired, witty &quot;everyman&quot; that Pulcinella represented. In later adaptations, Pulcinella was often portrayed as a puppet, as commedia dell&#x27;arte-style theatre did not continue to be popular throughout all of the continent over time. This puppet evolved into &quot;Mr. Punch&quot; in England. As half of Punch and Judy, he is recognized as one of the most important British icons in history.

The first recorded show to have involved the Punch-style marionette was performed in England in May 1662, outside of London in Covent Garden, by Bologna-born puppeteer Pietro Gimonde, also known as Signor Bologna. This marionette was named Punchinello, later shortened to Punch, and finally becoming wholly British with his transformation into Mr. Punch. The British Punch is far more childlike and violent than Pulcinella but is renowned for being just as funny. Always seen with cudgel in hand, Punch is more menacing than his Italian counterpart. In many performances, he murders his wife and child, as well as the Devil. In 1851, Henry Mayhew wrote of one performer who described the character&#x27;s enduring appeal: &quot;Like the rest of the world, he has got bad morals, but very few of them.&quot;

In Germany, this kind of Pulcinella-based puppet character came to be known as &quot;Kasper&quot;. Kasper is a cunning servant who solves the problems of all the masters he serves. He was less extreme than Mr. Punch, but offered the same kind of slapstick puppetry that audiences loved. This character became wildly popular throughout Europe. In the Netherlands, he is known as &quot;Jan Klaassen&quot;. In Denmark he is &quot;Mester Jakel&quot;. In Romania, he is &quot;Vasilache&quot;. In Hungary he is Paprika Jancsi (or Paprikajancsi) and in the 20th century Vitéz László. In France he remained &quot;Polichinelle&quot;. &quot;Polichinelles&quot; were featured as the children of Mother Ginger () in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; by Tchaikovsky.

Russian composer Igor Stravinsky was commissioned to compose two different ballets for the Ballets Russes that were inspired by variations of this character. Stravinsky&#x27;s ballets were entitled &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911), based on Russian 19th-century puppetry traditions celebrated at Shrovetide, and &quot;Pulcinella&quot; (1920), based on 17th-century Italian music (thought to be by Pergolesi) associated with a commedia dell&#x27;arte version.

The Italian psychoanalyst and philosopher Emilio Mordini has discussed Pulcinella secrets, saying that they help people to retain their sanity in contexts where secrets are impossible (for example: in small villages, or in today&#x27;s online world). Mordini argues that Pulcinella secrets &quot;are not really secret in the sense that they are unknown or unknowable, but because they are labeled as secret&quot;.

<text>The Russian alphabet (, or , more traditionally) is the script used to write the Russian language. It is derived from the Cyrillic script, which was modified in the 9th century to capture accurately the phonology of the first Slavic literary language, Old Slavonic. Initially an old variant of the Bulgarian alphabet, it was used in Kievan Rus&#x27; from the 10th century onward to write what would become the modern Russian language.

The modern Russian alphabet consists of 33 letters: twenty consonants (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ), ten vowels (, , , , , , , , , ), a semivowel / consonant (), and two modifier letters or &quot;signs&quot; (, ) that alter pronunciation of a preceding consonant or a following vowel.

==Letters==

: An alternative form of the letter De (Д д) closely resembles the Greek letter delta (Δ δ).
: An alternative form of the letter El (Л л) closely resembles the Greek letter lambda (Λ λ).

== Historic letters ==
===Letters eliminated in 1917–18===

* — Identical in pronunciation to , it was used exclusively immediately before other vowels and the (&quot;Short I&quot;) (for example, , &#x27;patriarch&#x27;) and in the word (&#x27;world&#x27;) and its derivatives, to distinguish it from the word (&#x27;peace&#x27;) (the two words are actually etymologically cognate and not arbitrarily homonyms).
* ѣ — Originally had a distinct sound, but by the middle of the eighteenth century, it had become identical in pronunciation to in the standard language. Since its elimination in 1918, it has remained a political symbol of the old orthography.
* ѳ — From the Greek theta, it was identical to in pronunciation, but it was used etymologically (for example, &quot;Theodore&quot; became &quot;Fyodor&quot;).
* ѵ — From the Greek upsilon, usually identical to in pronunciation, as in Byzantine Greek, it was used etymologically for Greek loanwords, like Latin Y (as in &quot;synod, myrrh&quot;); by 1918, it had become very rare. In spellings of the eighteenth century, it was also used after some vowels, where it has since been replaced with or (rarely) . For example, a Greek prefix originally spelled (equivalent to English ) is now spelled in most cases and as a component in some compound words.

=== Letters eliminated before 1750 ===
* corresponded to a more archaic pronunciation, already absent in East Slavic at the start of the historical period, but kept by tradition in certain words until the eighteenth century in secular writing and in Church Slavonic and Macedonian to the present day.
* and derived from Greek letters xi and psi. It was used etymologically, though inconsistently, in secular writing until the eighteenth century and more consistently to the present day in Church Slavonic.
* is the Greek letter omega, identical in pronunciation to . It was used in secular writing until the eighteenth century, but in the present day in Church Slavonic, it was mostly used to distinguish inflexional forms otherwise written identically.
* Two &quot;yuses&quot;, &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot; , used to stand for nasalized vowels and . According to linguistic reconstruction, both became irrelevant for East Slavic phonology at the beginning of the historical period but were introduced along with the rest of the Cyrillic script. The iotated yuses, and , had largely vanished by the twelfth century. The uniotated continued to be used, etymologically, until the sixteenth century. Thereafter it was restricted to being a dominical letter in the Paschal tables. The seventeenth-century usage of and survives in contemporary Church Slavonic, and the sounds (but not the letters) in Polish.
* The letter was adapted to represent the iotated in the middle or end of a word; the modern letter is an adaptation of its cursive form of the seventeenth century, enshrined by the typographical reform of 1708.
* Until 1708, the iotated was written  at the beginning of a word. This distinction between and survives in Church Slavonic.

Although it is usually stated that the letters in the table above were eliminated in the typographical reform of 1708, reality is somewhat more complex. The letters were indeed originally omitted from the sample alphabet, printed in a western-style serif font, presented in Peter edict, along with the letters (replaced by ), and (the diacriticized letter was also removed), but were reinstated except and under pressure from the Russian Orthodox Church in a later variant of the modern typeface (1710). Nonetheless, since 1735, the Russian Academy of Sciences began to use fonts without , and ; however, was sometimes used again since 1758.

Although praised by Western scholars and philosophers, it was criticized by clergy and many conservative scholars, who found the new standard too &quot;Russified&quot;. Some even went as far as to refer to Peter as the Anti-Christ.

Lomonosov also contributed to the Russian standard language, developing a &quot;High Style&quot; with high influence of Church Slavonic, which was to be used in formal situations such as religious texts; as well as &quot;Medium Style&quot; and &quot;Low Style&quot;, deemed for less formal events and casual writing. Lomonosov advocated for the &quot;Medium Style&quot;, which later became the basis of the modern Russian standard language.

==Consonants==
Most consonants can represent both &quot;soft&quot; (palatalized, represented in the IPA with a ) and &quot;hard&quot; consonant phonemes. If consonant letters are followed by vowel letters, the soft/hard quality of the consonant depends on whether the vowel is meant to follow &quot;hard&quot; consonants or &quot;soft&quot; consonants . A soft sign indicates palatalization of the preceding consonant without adding a vowel.

However, in modern Russian, six consonant phonemes do not have phonemically distinct &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; variants (except in foreign proper names) and do not change &quot;softness&quot; in the presence of other letters: are always hard; are always soft. (Before 1950, Russian linguists considered a semivowel rather than a consonant.)

==Vowels==

The Russian alphabet contains 10 vowel letters. They are grouped into soft and hard vowels. The soft vowels, , either indicate a preceding palatalized consonant, or (with the exception of ) are iotated (pronounced with a preceding ) in all other cases. The IPA vowels shown are a guideline only and sometimes are realized as different sounds, particularly when unstressed. However, may be used in words of foreign origin without palatalization (), and is often realized as between soft consonants, such as in (&#x27;toy ball&#x27;).

=== Individual vowels ===
 is an old Proto-Slavic close central vowel, thought to have been preserved better in modern Russian than in other Slavic languages. It was originally nasalized in certain positions: Old Russian ; Modern Russian (&#x27;rock&#x27;). Its written form developed as follows: + → → .

 was introduced in 1708 to distinguish the non-iotated/non-palatalizing from the iotated/palatalizing one. The original usage had been for the uniotated , or for the iotated, but had dropped out of use by the sixteenth century. In native Russian words, is found only at the beginnings of a few words &#x27;this (is) (m./f./n.)&#x27;, &#x27;these&#x27;, &#x27;what a&#x27;, &#x27;that way&#x27;, &#x27;sort of&#x27;, and interjections like &#x27;hey&#x27;) or in compound words (e.g., &#x27;therefore&#x27; = + , where is the dative case of ). In words that come from foreign languages in which iotated is uncommon or nonexistent (such as English), is usually written in the beginning of words and after vowels except (e.g., , &#x27;poet&#x27;), and after and consonants. However, the pronunciation is inconsistent. Many of these borrowed words, especially monosyllables, words ending in and many words where follows , , , , or , are pronounced with without palatalization or iotation: (&quot;seks&quot; — &#x27;sex&#x27;), (&quot;model&quot;&#x27; — &#x27;model&#x27;), (&quot;kafe&quot; — &#x27;café&#x27;), (&quot;proekt&quot; — &#x27;project&#x27;; here, the spelling is etymological: German &quot;Projekt&quot; was adopted from Latin &quot;proiectum&quot;, so the word is spelled with to reflect the original and not with as usual after vowels; but the pronunciation is counter-etymological: a hypercorrection that has become standard). But many other words are pronounced with : (&quot;syekta&quot; — &#x27;sect&#x27;), (&quot;dyebyut&quot; — &#x27;debut&#x27;).

Proper names are sometimes written with after consonants: — &#x27;Sam&#x27;, — &#x27;Pamela&#x27;, — &#x27;Mary&#x27;, — &#x27;Mao Zedong&#x27;; the use of after consonants is common in East Asian names and in English names with the sounds and , with some exceptions such as (&#x27;Jack&#x27;) and (&#x27;Shannon&#x27;), since both and , in cases of (&quot;zhe&quot;), (&quot;she&quot;) and (&quot;tse&quot;), follow consonants that are always hard (non-palatalized), yet usually prevails in writing. However, English names with the sounds , (if spelled in English) and after consonants are normally spelled with in Russian: — &#x27;Betty&#x27;, — &#x27;Peter&#x27;, — &#x27;Lake Placid&#x27;. Pronunciation mostly remains unpalatalized, so — Russian rendering of the English name &#x27;Peter&#x27; is pronounced differently from — is a colloquial Russian name of Saint Petersburg.

, introduced by Karamzin in 1797 and made official in 1943 by the Soviet Ministry of Education, marks a sound that historically developed from stressed . The written letter is optional; it is formally correct to write for both and . None of the several attempts in the twentieth century to mandate the use of have stuck.

==Non-vocalized letters==
===Hard sign===
The hard sign () acts like a &quot;silent back vowel&quot; that separates a succeeding &quot;soft vowel&quot; (, but not ) from a preceding consonant, invoking implicit iotation of the vowel with a distinct glide. Today it is used mostly to separate a prefix ending with a hard consonant from the following root. Its original pronunciation, lost by 1400 at the latest, was that of a very short middle schwa-like sound, likely pronounced or . Until the 1918 reform, no written word could end in a consonant: those that end in a &quot;hard&quot; consonant in modern orthography then had a final .

While is also a soft vowel, root-initial following a hard consonant is typically pronounced as . This is normally spelled (the hard counterpart to ) unless this vowel occurs at the beginning of a word, in which case it remains . An alternation between the two letters (but not the sounds) can be seen with the pair (&#x27;without name&#x27;, which is pronounced ) and (&#x27;nameless&#x27;, which is pronounced ). This spelling convention, however, is not applied with certain loaned prefixes such as in the word — , &#x27;Pan-Islamism&#x27;) and compound words (e.g., — , &#x27;high treason&#x27;).

===Soft sign===
The soft sign, , in most positions acts like a &quot;silent front vowel&quot; and indicates that the preceding consonant is palatalized (except for always-hard ) and the following vowel (if present) is iotated (including in loans). This is important as palatalization is phonemic in Russian. For example, (&#x27;brother&#x27;) contrasts with (&#x27;to take&#x27;). The original pronunciation of the soft sign, lost by 1400 at the latest, was that of a very short fronted reduced vowel but likely pronounced or . There are still some remnants of this ancient reading in modern Russian, e.g., in co-existing versions of the same name, read and written differently, such as and (&#x27;Mary&#x27;).

When applied after stem-final always-soft (, but not ) or always-hard (, but not ) consonants, the soft sign does not alter pronunciation, but has grammatical significance:
*the feminine marker for singular nouns in the nominative and accusative; e.g., (&#x27;India ink&#x27;, feminine) cf. (&#x27;flourish after a toast&#x27;, masculine) — both pronounced ;
*the imperative mood for some verbs;
*the infinitives of some verbs (with ending);
*the second person for non-past verbs (with ending); and
*some adverbs and particles.

== Treatment of foreign sounds ==
Because Russian borrows terms from other languages, there are various conventions for sounds not present in Russian. For example, while Russian has no , there are a number of common words (particularly proper nouns) borrowed from languages like English and German that contain such a sound in the original language. In well-established terms, such as (&#x27;hallucination&#x27;), this is written with and pronounced with , while newer terms use , pronounced with , such as (&#x27;hobby&#x27;). Similarly, words originally with in their source language are either pronounced with , as in the name (&#x27;Thelma&#x27;) or, if borrowed early enough, with or , as in the names (&#x27;Theodore&#x27;) and (&#x27;Matthew&#x27;).

For the affricate, which is common in the Asian countries that were part of the Russian Empire and the USSR, the letter combination is used: this is often transliterated into English either as or the Dutch form .

== Numeric values ==
The numerical values correspond to the Greek numerals, with being used for digamma, for koppa, and for sampi. The system was abandoned for secular purposes in 1708, after a transitional period of a century or so; it continues to be used in Church Slavonic, while general Russian texts use Indo-Arabic numerals and Roman numerals.

== Diacritics ==
The Cyrillic alphabet and Russian spelling generally employ fewer diacritics than those used in other European languages written with the Latin alphabet. The only diacritic, in the proper sense, is the acute accent  (Russian: &#x27;mark of stress&#x27;), which marks stress on a vowel, as it is done in Spanish and Greek. (Unicode has no code points for the accented letters; they are instead produced by suffixing the unaccented letter with .) Although Russian word stress is often unpredictable and can fall on different syllables in different forms of the same word, the diacritic accent is used only in dictionaries, children&#x27;s books, resources for foreign-language learners, the defining entry (in bold) in articles on Russian Wikipedia, or on minimal pairs distinguished only by stress (for instance, &#x27;castle&#x27; vs. &#x27;lock&#x27;). Rarely, it is also used to specify the stress in uncommon foreign words, and in poems with unusual stress used to fit the meter.

The letter is a special variant of the letter , which is not always distinguished in written Russian, but the umlaut-like sign has no other uses. Stress on this letter is never marked with a diacritic, as it is always stressed (except in some compounds and loanwords).

Both and the letter have completely separated from and . has been used since the 16th century (except that it was removed in 1708, but reinstated in 1735). Since then, its usage has been mandatory. It was formerly considered a diacriticized letter, but in the 20th century, it came to be considered a separate letter of the Russian alphabet. It was classified as a &quot;semivowel&quot; by 19th- and 20th-century grammarians, but since the 1970s, it has been considered a consonant letter.

==Frequency==

The frequency of characters in a corpus of written Russian was found to be as follows:

==Keyboard layout==
Microsoft Windows keyboard layout for personal computers is as follows:

However, there are several variations of so-called &quot;phonetic keyboards&quot; that are often used by non-Russians, where pressing an English letter key will type the Russian letter with a similar sound (A → А, S → С, D → Д, F → Ф, etc.).

==Letter names==
Until approximately the year 1900, mnemonic names inherited from Church Slavonic were used for the letters. They are given here in the pre-1918 orthography of the post-1708 civil alphabet.

The Russian poet Alexander Pushkin wrote: &quot;The [names of the] letters that make up the Slavonic alphabet don&#x27;t represent a meaning at all. &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot; etc. are individual words, chosen just for their initial sound&quot;. However, since the names of the first few letters of the Slavonic alphabet seem to form readable text, attempts have been made to compose meaningful snippets of text from groups of consecutive letters for the rest of the alphabet. Here is one such attempt to &quot;decode&quot; the message:

In this attempt, only lines 1, 2 and 5 somewhat correspond to real meanings of the letters&#x27; names, while &quot;translations&quot; in other lines seem to be fabrications or fantasies. For example, &quot;&quot; (&quot;rest&quot; or &quot;apartment&quot;) does not mean &quot;the Universe&quot;, and &quot;&quot; does not have any meaning in Russian or other Slavic languages (there are no words of Slavic origin beginning with &quot;f&quot; at all). The last line contains only one translatable word — &quot;&quot; (&quot;worm&quot;), which, however, was not included in the &quot;translation&quot;.

<doc id="316937" wikidata="Q164498" url="?curid=316937" title="Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse">
<text>Louis IV (; 12 September 1837 – 13 March 1892) was the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine from 13 June 1877 until his death in 1892. Through his marriage to Queen Victoria&#x27;s second daughter Alice, he was connected to the British royal family. Two of his daughters married into the House of Romanov.

==Early life==
Louis was born at the Prinz-Karl-Palais in Darmstadt, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine in the German Confederation, the first son and child of Prince Charles of Hesse and by Rhine (23 April 1809 – 20 March 1877) and Princess Elisabeth of Prussia (18 June 1815 – 21 March 1885), granddaughter of King Frederick William II of Prussia. As his father&#x27;s elder brother Louis III (1806–1877), the future Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, had been married to his first wife since 1833 without legitimate children and from 1868 was married morganatically, Prince Louis was from birth third-in-line to the grand ducal throne, after his uncle and father.

==First marriage==
On 1 July 1862, Louis married Princess Alice, a daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. On the day of the wedding, the Queen issued a royal warrant granting her new son-in-law the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; in the United Kingdom. The Queen also subsequently made Prince Louis a knight of the Order of the Garter.

Although this was an arranged marriage orchestrated by the bride&#x27;s father Albert, Prince Consort, the couple did have a brief period of courtship before betrothal and wed willingly, even after the death of the Prince Consort left Queen Victoria in a protracted state of grief that cast a pall over the nuptials. Becoming parents in less than a year following their marriage, the young royal couple found themselves strapped financially to maintain the lifestyle expected of their rank. Princess Alice&#x27;s interest in social services, scientific development, hands-on child-rearing, charity and intellectual stimulation were not shared by Louis who, although dutiful and benevolent, was bluff in manner and conventional in his pursuits. The death of the younger of their two sons, Frittie, who was afflicted with hemophilia and suffered a fatal fall from a palace window before his third birthday in 1873, combined with the wearying war relief duties Alice had undertaken in 1870, evoked a crisis of spiritual faith for the princess in which her husband does not appear to have shared.

==Military career==
During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Louis commanded the Hessian cavalry in support of the Austrian side.

The Austrians were defeated in the war, and the Hessian grand duchy was in jeopardy of being awarded as the spoils of war to victorious Prussia, which annexed some of Austria&#x27;s other allies (Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, Nassau). Hesse-Darmstadt appears to have been spared this fate only by a cession of territory and the close dynastic kinship between its ruler and the Emperor of Russia (Alexander II&#x27;s consort, Empress Maria Alexandrovna, was the sister of Hesse&#x27;s Grand Duke Louis III and of Prince Charles).

In the Franco-Prussian War Prince Louis fought on the side of Prussia and the North German Confederation; commanding the 25th Division. He was credited with courageous military service, especially at the Battle of Gravelotte, which also afforded him the opportunity of mending the previous war&#x27;s grievances with the House of Hohenzollern by fighting on the same side as his brother-in-law and future emperor, Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia. He had a good relationship with Frederick William and his wife Victoria, Princess Royal, for his entire life. He also visited him on his deathbed in 1888.

==Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine==
In March 1877, Louis became heir presumptive to the Hessian throne when his father died and, less than three months later, found himself reigning grand duke upon the demise of his uncle, Louis III.

A year and a half later, however, Grand Duke Louis was stricken with diphtheria along with most of his immediate family. He recovered; but his four-year-old daughter Marie succumbed, along with his wife of 16 years. From then on, he reigned and raised his five surviving children alone. His youngest surviving daughter, Alix, married Tsar Nicholas II two years after his death in 1894.

==Second marriage==

Grand Duchess Alice having died in 1878, Louis IV contracted a morganatic marriage on 30 April 1884 in Darmstadt (on the eve of the wedding of his eldest daughter, for which Queen Victoria and other relatives of his first wife were gathered in the Hessian capital) with Countess Alexandrine von Hutten-Czapska (3 September 1854 – 8 May 1941), younger daughter of Count Adam von Hutten-Czapski (1819–1884) and his wife, Countess Marianna Rzewuska (1827–1897). She was the former wife of Aleksander von Kolemin, the Russian chargé d&#x27;affaires in Darmstadt. But the couple, facing objections from the Grand Duke&#x27;s in-laws, separated within a week and the marriage was annulled within three months. As a compensation, she received the title &quot;Countess von Romrod&quot; on 31 May 1884 and a financial compensation. Alexandrine later married for the third time to Basil von Bacheracht.

==Death==
Grand Duke Ludwig IV died of a heart attack in the New Palace in Darmstadt on 13 March 1892. He was succeeded by his son, Ernest Louis.

<text>City rhythm is a metaphor for the regular coming and going in cities, the repetitive activities, the sounds and smells that occur regularly in cities. The recognition of city rhythms is a useful metaphor, helping to understand modern city life. The concept of city rhythm makes it possible to understand the multitude of aspects of city life. Traditional approaches to urban thinking focus on one such rhythm only, normally the dominant one. This leads to the omission of many aspects of city life.

&quot;Dominant rhythm&quot; is a metaphor used in conjunction with city rhythm. It is the most powerful rhythm in a city, enabling the shaping and forming of time and space, both within the city and in faraway places through networks.

These dominant rhythms are not fixed and indeed change. Religious rhythms were more dominant in the past, whereas at present economic rhythms prevail.

<text>Ecological modernization is a school of thought that argues that both the state and the market can work together to protect the environment. It has gained increasing attention among scholars and policymakers in the last several decades internationally. It is an analytical approach as well as a policy strategy and environmental discourse (Hajer, 1995).

Ecological modernization emerged in the early 1980s within a group of scholars at Free University and the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin, among them Joseph Huber, and . Various authors pursued similar ideas at the time, e.g. Arthur H. Rosenfeld, Amory Lovins, Donald Huisingh, René Kemp, or Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker. Further substantial contributions were made by Arthur P.J. Mol, Gert Spaargaren and David A Sonnenfeld (Mol and Sonnenfeld, 2000; Mol, 2001).

One basic assumption of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation of economic growth and industrial development. On the basis of enlightened self-interest, economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental productivity, i.e. productive use of natural resources and environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development in the same way as labour productivity and capital productivity. This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable supply chain management, clean technologies, benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product design for environment. Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the industrial metabolism. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment&#x27;s carrying capacity, ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.

There are different understandings of the scope of ecological modernization - whether it is just about techno-industrial progress and related aspects of policy and economy, and to what extent it also includes cultural aspects (ecological modernization of mind, value orientations, attitudes, behaviour and lifestyles). Similarly, there is some pluralism as to whether ecological modernization would need to rely mainly on government, or markets and entrepreneurship, or civil society, or some sort of multi-level governance combining the three. Some scholars explicitly refer to general modernization theory as well as non-Marxist world-system theory, others don&#x27;t.

Ultimately, however, there is a common understanding that ecological modernization will have to result in innovative structural change. So research is now still more focused on environmental innovations, or eco-innovations, and the interplay of various societal factors (scientific, economic, institutional, legal, political, cultural) which foster or hamper such innovations (Klemmer et al., 1999; Huber, 2004; Weber and Hemmelskamp, 2005; Olsthoorn and Wieczorek, 2006).

Ecological modernization shares a number of features with neighbouring, overlapping approaches. Among the most important are
*the concept of sustainable development
*the approach of industrial metabolism (Ayres and Simonis, 1994)
*the concept of industrial ecology (Socolow, 1994)

==Additional elements==
A special topic of ecological modernization research during recent years was &quot;sustainable household&quot;, i.e. environment-oriented reshaping of lifestyles, consumption patterns, and demand-pull control of supply chains (Vergragt, 2000; OECD 2002). 
Some scholars of ecological modernization share an interest in industrial symbiosis, i.e. inter-site recycling that helps to reduce the consumption of resources via increasing efficiency (i.e. pollution prevention, waste reduction), typically by taking externalities from one economic production process and using them as raw material inputs for another (Christoff, 1996). 
Ecological modernization also relies on product life-cycle assessment and the analysis of materials and energy flows. In this context, ecological modernization promotes &#x27;cradle to cradle&#x27; manufacturing (Braungart and McDonough, 2002), contrasted against the usual &#x27;cradle to grave&#x27; forms of manufacturing - where waste is not re-integrated back into the production process. 
Another special interest in the ecological modernization literature has been the role of social movements and the emergence of civil society as a key agent of change (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001).

As a strategy of change, some forms of ecological modernization may be favored by business interests because they seemingly meet the triple bottom line of economics, society, and environment, which, it is held, underpin sustainability, yet do not challenge free market principles. This contrasts with many environmental movement perspectives, which regard free trade and its notion of business self-regulation as part of the problem, or even an origin of environmental degradation. Under ecological modernization, the state is seen in a variety of roles and capacities: as the enabler for markets that help produce the technological advances via competition; as the regulatory (see regulation) medium through which corporations are forced to &#x27;take back&#x27; their various wastes and re-integrate them in some manner into the production of new goods and services (e.g. the way that car corporations in Germany are required to accept back cars they manufactured once those vehicles have reached the end of their product lifespan); and in some cases as an institution that is incapable of addressing critical local, national, and global environmental problems. In the latter case, ecological modernization shares with Ulrich Beck (1999, 37-40) and others notions of the necessity of emergence of new forms of environmental governance, sometimes referred to as subpolitics or political modernization, where the environmental movement, community groups, businesses, and other stakeholders increasingly take on direct and leadership roles in stimulating environmental transformation. Political modernization of this sort requires certain supporting norms and institutions such as a free, independent, or at least critical press, basic human rights of expression, organization, and assembly, etc. New media such as the Internet greatly facilitate this.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that ecological modernization will fail to protect the environment and does nothing to alter the impulses within the capitalist economic mode of production (see capitalism) that inevitably lead to environmental degradation (Foster, 2002). As such, it is just a form of &#x27;green-washing&#x27;. Critics question whether technological advances alone can achieve resource conservation and better environmental protection, particularly if left to business self-regulation practices (York and Rosa, 2003). For instance, many technological improvements are currently feasible but not widely utilized. The most environmentally friendly product or manufacturing process (which is often also the most economically efficient) is not always the one automatically chosen by self-regulating corporations (e.g. hydrogen or biofuel vs. peak oil). In addition, some critics have argued that ecological modernization does not redress gross injustices that are produced within the capitalist system, such as environmental racism - where people of color and low income earners bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harm such as pollution, and lack access to environmental benefits such as parks, and social justice issues such as eliminating unemployment (Bullard, 1993; Gleeson and Low, 1999; Harvey, 1996) - environmental racism is also referred to as issues of the asymmetric distribution of environmental resources and services (Everett &amp; Neu, 2000). Moreover, the theory seems to have limited global efficacy, applying primarily to its countries of origin - Germany and the Netherlands, and having little to say about the developing world (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001). Perhaps the harshest criticism though, is that ecological modernization is predicated upon the notion of &#x27;sustainable growth&#x27;, and in reality this is not possible because growth entails the consumption of natural and human capital at great costs to ecosystems and societies.

Ecological modernization, its effectiveness and applicability, strengths and limitations, remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental social science research and policy discourse in the early 21st century.

<text>Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich (25 August 1752 – 22 December 1828) was an Austrian officer. He is best remembered as the commander of the Austrian forces that capitulated to Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in the Battle of Ulm in 1805.

==Early career==
Karl Mack was born at Nennslingen, in the Principality of Ansbach. In 1770 he joined an Austrian cavalry regiment, in which his uncle, Georg Wilhelm Leiberich, was a squadron commander, becoming an officer seven years later. During the brief War of the Bavarian Succession he was selected for service on the staff of Count Kinsky, under whom, and subsequently under the commander-in-chief Field Marshal Count Lacy, he did excellent work. He was promoted first lieutenant in 1778, and captain on the quartermaster-general&#x27;s staff in 1783. Count Lacy, then the foremost soldier of the Austrian army, had the highest opinion of his young assistant. In 1785 Mack married Katherine Gabrieul, and was ennobled under the name of Mack von Leiberich.

In the Turkish War he was employed on the headquarters staff, becoming in 1788 major and personal aide-de-camp to the emperor, Joseph II and in 1789 was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He distinguished himself in the storming of Belgrade in 1789. Shortly after this, disagreements between Mack and Ernst Gideon von Laudon, now commander-in-chief, led to the former demanding a court-martial; Mack left the front but received a colonelcy (1789) and the Order of Maria Theresa. In 1790 Laudon and Mack, reconciled, were again on the field together. During these campaigns Mack received a severe head injury from which he never fully recovered. In 1793 he was made quartermaster-general (chief of staff) to Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg, commanding in the Netherlands and he enhanced his reputation by the ensuing campaign. The young Archduke Charles of Austria, who won his own first laurels in the action of March 1, 1793, wrote after the battle, &quot;Above all we have to thank Colonel Mack for these successes&quot;.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
Mack distinguished himself again on the field of Neerwinden and had a leading part in the negotiations between Coburg and Dumouriez. He continued to serve as quartermaster-general and was made titular chief (&quot;Inhaber&quot;) of a cuirassier regiment. He received a wound at Famars and in 1794 was once more engaged in active service after being made a major-general.

While Mack had been credited with the initial successes of March–April 1793, the ultimate failure of the coalition allies was also ascribed to him even though it was due to political and military factors over which he had no control. He fell into disfavour in military circles with only the Emperor (now Francis II) remaining as his supporter. In 1797, Mack was promoted Feldmarschall-leutnant and the following year he accepted the command of the Neapolitan army at the personal request of the Emperor. The unpromising material of his new command against the French revolutionary troops and in actual danger of being murdered by his own men prompted Mack to abandon his command and to take refuge in the French camp. Initially, he was promised to be returned to his own country but Napoleon ordered instead that he should be sent to France as a prisoner of war.

==War of the Third Coalition==

Two years later he escaped from Paris in disguise. There were allegations that he broke his parole, a severe allegation that reflected on his honor as a gentleman and an officer (in the opinion of the anonymous author of his biography in the 1911 Eleventh edition of Encyclopædia Britannica this allegation was false).

He was not employed for some years, but in 1804, when the war party in the Austrian court needed a general to oppose the peace policy of the Archduke Charles, Mack was made quartermaster-general of the army, with instructions to prepare for a war with France. He did all that was possible within the available time to reform the army, and on the opening of the war of 1805 he became quartermaster-general to the titular commander-in-chief in Germany, the Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este, who was himself inexperienced in military command. Consequently, Mack held the real responsible commander of the army that opposed Napoleon in Bavaria, but his position was ill-defined and his authority treated with minimal respect by the other general officers. Furthermore, the restructuring of the Habsburg military had been incomplete; Mack chose to initiate some of Charles&#x27; innovations, while ignoring others. His own insecurities and vagaries did not encourage the confidence of the staff; in the campaigning that led up to the Battle of Ulm, Mack&#x27;s frequent reversals of Viennese policy, and even his own decisions, further undermined an already fragile command structure.

At Ulm in October 1805, he surrendered the entire army to Napoleon. A few of his officers, including Prince von Schwarzenberg, broke through the French defenses in a massed cavalry charge and escaped, but most of the Austrian high command was captured with 25,000 men, 18 generals, 65 guns, and 40 standards. The general officers received a parole that required them to abstain from combat with France, removing the bulk of Habsburg commanders from the possibility of service in the upcoming campaign of the Upper Danube.

After Austerlitz, Mack was convicted of cowardice by a court-martial. He was deprived of his rank, his regiment, and his honors, chiefly the Order of Maria Theresa, and imprisoned for two years. Upon his release in 1808, he lived in relative obscurity until 1819, when the ultimate victory of the allies had obliterated the memory of earlier disasters, he was, at the request of Prince Schwarzenberg, reinstated in the army as Feldmarschall-leutnant, and a member of the Order of Maria Theresa. He died on 22 October 1828 at S. Pölten. Mack makes a brief appearance as a character in book two of Volume I of Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

<text>The Missile Transportable Anti-aérien Léger (English: Transportable lightweight anti-air missile), commonly called Mistral, is a French infrared homing short range air defense system manufactured by MBDA France (formerly by Matra Défense and then Matra BAe Dynamics). Based on the French SATCP (&quot;Sol-Air à Très Courte Portée&quot;), the development of the portable system later to become the Mistral began in 1974. The first version of the system was introduced in 1988 (S1), the second in 1997 (Mistral 2), and the third in 2018 (Mistral 3).

== Description ==

Mistral is a short-range air defence (SHORAD) missile system that can be used from vehicles, surface ships, and helicopters, as well as in a portable configuration. The &quot;Mistral&quot; missile is transported in a transport and launch container (MPC) together with &quot;friend or foe&quot; interrogator, power source and tripod with its sighting devices.

It differs from MANPADS systems in that it is necessarily fired from a structure bringing together the rail (support of the launcher tube), the aiming - designation - fire control system, and a pod (structure connecting the whole to the ground , a vehicle or any other platform). It can also be configured as an airborne (helicopter) or mechanized (remote or automated turret, land or naval) system.

Unlike a MANPADS, it cannot be used from the shoulder. It is a mandatory posted system.

They are then to be operated by a pair of crew as commander and the shooter. There are also launch units that allow the missile to be fired from armoured vehicles, ships or helicopters (such as the Aérospatiale Gazelle, Denel Rooivalk, or Eurocopter Tiger). To defeat flares ejected from the rear of a targeted aircraft, proportional navigation using a gyro as a reference is adopted for Mistral, instead of the pursuit method in earlier IR-guided MANPADS. To further enhance the ECCM capability, the seeker of Mistral has a very narrow field of view to reject decoys and interference, the seeker can tilt in the range of +/− 38 degrees. On the launcher, the missile runs up the gyro in 2 seconds, and total reaction time is 5 seconds. The all-aspect two-color (2–4 and 3–5 μm) cooled IR-seeker of Mistral is developed by SAT (&quot;Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications&quot;), and the missile adopts both laser proximity and impact fuzes.

The MCP (Mistral Coordination Post) was first shown at the 1991 Paris Air Show fitted with SHORAR (Short-range Anti-aircraft Defence Radar) from Oerlikon Contraves. The MCP is designed to be used with a portable Mistral system, ATLAS, ALBI or MPCV systems and also used as part of MBDA Mistral missile Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) systems for air defense of military units and important facilities.

The MCP provides target designation and fire control for eleven Mistral firing unit, ALBI, ATLAS or MPCV air defence systems. The MCP is mounted on a truck chassis or any other off-road chassis. The newer version of MCP are called the IMCP or Improved Missile Control Post.

A close-in weapon system based on Mistral is a six-missile version called &quot;Sadral&quot;, with a stabilized rapid-reload launcher that is fully automated. A CSEE developed fire control director is integrated to the launcher, consisted of TV camera and FLIR. Image produced by both directors appear on the screen in the operator console below deck, and the missiles are locked onto the target before being launched. A fully loaded Sadral launcher weighs 1080 kg, and the operator console weighs 280 kg. A two-missile unit installed on ships is called &quot;Simbad&quot;, and a newly launched four-missile version is called &quot;Tetral&quot;. An evolution of the &quot;Simbad&quot; is now proposed: &quot;Simbad RC&quot;. Both &quot;Tetral&quot; and &quot;Simbad RC&quot; are remote controlled from the ship&#x27;s deck while the original Simbad is manually operated with a simple optical sight.

==History==
Mistral missiles used by the Rwandan forces in the Second Congo War shot down a Zimbabwean Air Force BAE Hawk fighter on 23 March 1999.

Two automated SADRAL launchers (re-cycled from the retiring s) and each equipped with six Mistral Mk 3 surface-to-air missiles were fitted to three s of the French Navy in the 2021–2023 period. The system replaced the previous Crotale system in order to provide a modernized defence against sea-skimming targets. The Mistral Mk 3 carries an infrared imaging seeker and possesses advanced image processing capabilities. This allows it to engage low thermal signature targets such as: UAVs, turbojet-powered missiles and fast craft at long range, while reportedly offering resistance to countermeasures. The system is also carried on the aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, the s and (SIMBAD-RC) is being installed on the French Navy&#x27;s &quot;Jacques Chevallier&quot;-class support ships.

Two Sadral turrets for Mistral were also installed on the raised deck on each side of the helicopter hangar of the former s. Space for the SADRAL/Mistral system is also provided for on the French s but, as of 2021, has not been installed on those vessels.

Norway sent 100 Mistral systems to Ukraine shortly after the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In response to the need for faster weapon shipments as a result of the war, in early 2023 MBDA started accelerating production of the Mistral 3 from 20 to 30 missiles per month, and to 40 per month by late 2023.

== Variants ==
The Mistral entered production in 1989 and is now deployed in various forms by 37 armed forces of 25 countries including Austria, the Brazilian Marine Corps, Chile, Colombia, Cyprus, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Indonesia, Morocco, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, Spain, and Venezuela.
Norway donated their complete stock of Mistral missiles in 2022 to Ukraine.

<doc id="316972" wikidata="Q4832334" url="?curid=316972" title="Azeban">
<text>Azeban, or &quot;the Raccoon,&quot; is a lower-level trickster spirit in Abenaki mythology. The traditional homeland of the Abenaki is Wobanakik (&quot;Place of the Dawn&quot;), what is now called northern New England, southern Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Azeban (also spelled Azban, Asban or Azaban) is a raccoon, the Abenaki trickster figure. Pronounced ah-zuh-bahn. Azeban does many foolish and/or mischievous things in Abenaki folktales, but unlike animal tricksters in some other tribes, is not dangerous or malevolent.

Azeban deceives animals and other beings for food or other services.

There is an Abenaki story where a woman names her six dogs after their characteristics. She named one of the dogs Azeban. This woman Cedar Girl of the Abenaki [Dawn Land People] naming her dog &quot;Azeban&quot; has caused some confusion, causing people to assume the Abenaki trickster figure is a dog, not realizing she called the dog Azeban because he has the characteristics of the raccoon, the actual Abenaki Trickster figure. In the story the dog Azeban is one of a litter of six dogs born to Awasosqua (&quot;Bear Woman&quot;). The others are Awasosis (&quot;Little Bear&quot;), Kwaniwibid (&quot;Long Tooth&quot;), Mikwe (&quot;Squirrel&quot;), Moosis (&quot;Little Moose&quot;) and Soksemo (&quot;Good Nose&quot;). All the spirits in Awasosqua&#x27;s broods are dogs, and are named after their characteristics.

In another story, Azeban sees a waterfall and, appreciating its noise, thinks he can make an even louder sound. He shouts until he loses his balance and falls in.

<doc id="316976" wikidata="Q3951787" url="?curid=316976" title="Hobson's choice">
<text>A Hobson&#x27;s choice is a free choice in which only one thing is actually offered. The term is often used to describe an illusion that choices are available. The best known Hobson&#x27;s choice is &quot;I&#x27;ll give you a choice: take it or leave it&quot;, wherein &quot;leaving it&quot; is strongly undesirable.

The phrase is said to have originated with Thomas Hobson (1544–1631), a livery stable owner in Cambridge, England, who offered customers the choice of either taking the horse in his stall nearest to the door or taking none at all.

==Origins==

According to a plaque underneath a painting of Hobson donated to Cambridge Guildhall, Hobson had an extensive stable of some 40 horses. This gave the appearance to his customers that, upon entry, they would have their choice of mounts, when in fact there was only one: Hobson required his customers to take the horse in the stall closest to the door. This was to prevent the best horses from always being chosen, which would have meant overuse of the good horses. Hobson&#x27;s stable was located on land that is now owned by St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Early appearances in writing==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first known written usage of this phrase is in &quot;The rustick&#x27;s alarm to the Rabbies&quot;, written by Samuel Fisher in 1660:

It also appears in Joseph Addison&#x27;s paper &quot;The Spectator&quot; (No. 509 of 14 October 1712); and in Thomas Ward&#x27;s 1688 poem &quot;England&#x27;s Reformation&quot;, not published until after Ward&#x27;s death. Ward wrote:

==Modern use==
The term &quot;Hobson&#x27;s choice&quot; is often used to mean an illusion of choice, but it is not a choice between two equivalent options, which is a Morton&#x27;s fork, nor is it a choice between two undesirable options, which is a dilemma. Hobson&#x27;s choice is one between something or nothing.

John Stuart Mill, in his book &quot;Considerations on Representative Government&quot;, refers to Hobson&#x27;s choice:

In another of his books, &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;, Mill discusses marriage:

==Different from==
A Hobson&#x27;s choice is different from:
* Dilemma: a choice between two or more options, none of which is attractive.
* False dilemma: only certain choices are considered, when in fact there are others.
* Catch-22: a logical paradox arising from a situation in which an individual needs something that can only be acquired by not being in that very situation.
* Morton&#x27;s fork, and a double bind: choices yield equivalent and, often, undesirable results.
* Blackmail and extortion: the choice between paying money (or some non-monetary good or deed) or risk suffering an unpleasant action.

A common error is to use the phrase &quot;Hobbesian choice&quot; instead of &quot;Hobson&#x27;s choice&quot;, confusing the philosopher Thomas Hobbes with the relatively obscure Thomas Hobson. (It is possible the confusion is between &quot;Hobson&#x27;s choice&quot; and a &quot;Hobbesian trap&quot;, which refers to the situation in which a state attacks another out of fear.)

==Common law==

In &quot;Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha&quot; (1983), Justice Byron White dissented and classified the majority&#x27;s decision to strike down the &quot;one-house veto&quot; as unconstitutional as leaving Congress with a Hobson&#x27;s choice. Congress may choose between &quot;refrain[ing] from delegating the necessary authority, leaving itself with a hopeless task of writing laws with the requisite specificity to cover endless special circumstances across the entire policy landscape, or in the alternative, to abdicate its law-making function to the executive branch and independent agency&quot;.

In &quot;Philadelphia v. New Jersey&quot;, 437 U.S. 617 (1978), the majority opinion ruled that a New Jersey law which prohibited the importation of solid or liquid waste from other states into New Jersey was unconstitutional based on the Commerce Clause. The majority reasoned that New Jersey cannot discriminate between the intrastate waste and the interstate waste without due justification. In dissent, Justice Rehnquist stated:

In &quot;Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York&quot;, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), the judgement of the court was that

In the South African Constitutional Case &quot; MEC for Education, Kwa-Zulu Natal and Others v Pillay&quot;, 2008 (1) SA 474 (CC) Chief Justice Langa for the majority of the Court (in Paragraph 62 of the judgement) writes that:
 
In &quot;Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis&quot; (2018), Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented and added in one of the footnotes that the petitioners &quot;faced a Hobson’s choice: accept arbitration on their employer’s terms or give up their jobs&quot;.

In 

In &quot;Meriwether v. Hartop&quot;, the court addressed the university&#x27;s offer, &quot;Don’t use any pronouns or sex-based terms at all.&quot; It wrote, &quot;The effect of this Hobson’s Choice is that Meriwether must adhere to the university’s orthodoxy (or face punishment). This is coercion, at the very least of the indirect sort.&quot;

<text>Lancaster University (officially The University of Lancaster) is a public research university in Lancaster, Lancashire, England. The university was established in 1964 by royal charter, as one of several new universities created in the 1960s.

The university was initially based in St Leonard&#x27;s Gate in the city centre, before starting a move in 1967 to a purpose-built campus located on at Bailrigg, to the south of the city. The campus buildings are arranged around a central walkway known as the Spine, which is connected to a central plaza, named Alexandra Square in honour of its first chancellor, Princess Alexandra.

Lancaster is a residential collegiate university; the colleges are weakly autonomous. The eight undergraduate colleges are named after places in the historic county of Lancashire, and each has its own campus residence blocks, common rooms, administrative staff and bars.

Lancaster has ranked in the top fifteen in all three UK national league tables for the past 10 years, and received a Gold rating in the Government&#x27;s 2017 and 2023 Teaching Excellence Framework. The annual income of the institution for 2023/24 was £401.7 million of which £48.5 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £290.7 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancaster Financial Statement 23/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancaster is a member of the N8 Group of research universities, which also includes the universities of Durham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and York. Since 2015, Alan Milburn has been the university&#x27;s chancellor.

==History==
Between 1958 and 1961 seven new plate glass universities were announced, including Lancaster. The choice of Lancaster as the site of the fourth new university was announced on 23 November 1961.

The university was established by royal charter in 1964. The charter stipulated that Princess Alexandra of Kent be the first chancellor. She was inaugurated in 1964. The ceremony also saw the granting of various honorary degrees to dignitaries including the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson.

Princess Alexandra retired as chancellor in 2004 and was at that time the longest serving chancellor of any British university. On her departure, she gave approval for the Chancellor&#x27;s Medal to be awarded for academic merit to the highest-performing undergraduates and postgraduates. Each year presentations are made to up to five graduates of taught masters&#x27; courses and up to six to the highest-performing undergraduates.

The university accepted its first students in October 1964 and there were initially 13 professors, 32 additional members of teaching and research staff, 8 library staff and 14 administrators on academic grades. The motto, &quot;patet omnibus veritas&quot;, (&quot;Truth lies open to all&quot;), was adopted. The first science students were admitted in 1965.

The university was temporarily based in the city. A lecture theatre and the university&#x27;s first Junior Common Room were in Centenary Church, a former Congregational church beside the old factory premises of Waring &amp; Gillow, which were used to accommodate the new students. Many new students were housed in the nearby town of Morecambe. The Grand Theatre was leased as a main lecture room and 112 and 114 in the St Leonard&#x27;s Gate area became teaching and recreational rooms. The library occupied the old workshops of Shrigley and Hunt on Castle Hill.

Bowland and Lonsdale colleges were founded as the university&#x27;s first two colleges, and all staff and students were allocated to one of the two, although the first college buildings would not be completed until 1966. The first students moved into residence and set up the first JCRs in October 1968.

The university moved from the city to the new campus at Bailrigg between 1966 and 1970.

In 2014, Lancaster University celebrated its 50th anniversary with a series of events throughout the year, involving alumni, staff, students and local community members. 

In 2024, the Students&#x27; Union Assembly voted to lobby the University to transition the catering to 50% vegan by 2025 and 100% vegan by 2027 without major student consultation. The vote was supported by the student chapter of Plant-Based Universities.

===Bailrigg===
The purpose-built campus occupies Bailrigg, a site donated by Lancaster City Council in 1963. The campus buildings are located on a hilltop, the lower slopes of which are landscaped parkland which includes Lake Carter duck pond and the university sports fields. The lake was created in the early 1900s and was later named Lake Carter after Charles Carter, the first Vice Chancellor of the university. The site is three miles (5 km) south of the city centre. Construction of the Bailrigg campus began in November 1965, with the first building completed a year later. The first on-campus student residences opened in 1968.

Unlike some other campus universities, Bailrigg was designed to integrate social, residential and teaching areas. Another major feature of the design is that there is no large central Students&#x27; Union building, instead individual college facilities are used as the centre for social and recreational activities .

Vehicular and pedestrian traffic is separated: this is achieved by restricting motor vehicles to a peripheral road with a linking underpass running east–west beneath Alexandra Square. The underpass accommodates the Bailrigg bus station and was refurbished in autumn 2010. Car parking is arranged in cul-de-sacs running off the peripheral road.

The campus buildings are arranged around a central walkway known as &quot;The Spine&quot;. The walkway runs from north (County College) to south-west (Graduate College) and is covered for most of its length. The main architect was Gabriel Epstein of Shepheard and Epstein. Architect Peter Shepheard recalls:

&quot;We went up there on a windy day, and it was freezing cold. Every time we opened a plan it blew away. And we said Christ! What are we going to do with these students, where are they going to sit in the sun and all that? Well, we decided, it&#x27;s got to be cloisters. All of the buildings have got to touch at the ground. We then devised this system and it had an absolutely firm principle: it had a great spine down the middle where everybody walked. That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one. I thought it worked very well.&quot;

Between 2016 and 2018 the Spine was extensively remodelled in a project known as &quot;Design The Spine&quot;, with the aim of replacing the decaying wooden canopy, widening bottlenecks, and creating new landscaped green spaces.
Alexandra Square is the university&#x27;s main plaza. Named after the first chancellor, Princess Alexandra and is situated at the centre of the original campus. On the west side of the square is University House as well as various banks and shops. To the south-east of the square is the tallest building on campus: the fourteen-storey Bowland Tower, which contains accommodation and disguises the boiler room chimney.

One of the most distinctive of the Bailrigg buildings is the free-standing University Chaplaincy Centre. Opened on 2 May 1969, the architects were the Preston-based firm Cassidy &amp; Ashton. The building has a trefoil plan with a central spire where the three circles meet. The university&#x27;s former logo is based on the spire.

A plan existed to have a twin campus with another eight colleges to the east of the M6 motorway at Hazelrigg. This would have been linked to Bailrigg by a flyover. The plan was abandoned in the 1970s during a period of financial difficulties.

=== Library ===
In the south-west corner sits the library designed in 1964 by Tom Mellor and Partners, the first phase opening in September 1966, the second in July 1968 and the third in January 1971. The library was extended in 1997 and underwent a phased refurbishment in 2014, which was completed in 2016. In 2021 the Library Extension Project was completed, which introduced additional student study space and &#x27;living walls&#x27;, exhibition and research space, a &#x27;safepod&#x27; and digital studio.

A distinctive feature of the library is the large tree that grows in the centre of the ground floor study area.

Next to the library, and opened in 1998 is The Ruskin - Library, Museum and Research Centre, designed by Sir Richard MacCormac

===South-West Campus===

The university began expansion onto the lower slopes of Bailrigg with the development of new buildings for Graduate College in 1998, which is now part of South-West Campus. Development continued with the construction of InfoLab21 and Alexandra Park which now houses Lonsdale College, Cartmel College and the en-suite rooms of Pendle College. The development of InfoLab21 met objections, with the proposed building being described as a &#x27;Dalek factory&#x27;.

Cartmel College is built around Barker House Farm, a listed 17th-century farmhouse and outbuildings that form the centre of the college.

===Health Innovation Centre===

The university is building a &#x27;Health Innovation Campus&#x27; adjacent to the existing campus. The campus will create 2,000 jobs and boost the local economy by around £100 million. The £29.7 million contract for construction of the first building was awarded to BAM Construction in October 2017; construction began in December 2017 and was completed in summer 2020. The building is 80,000 square feet and required the construction of an access road with a junction to the A6.

===Services===
The Bailrigg campus hosts a range of shops and services. Services on campus include Bailrigg post office, a health centre, a pharmacy, hairdressers, Lancaster University Homes office as well as many others.

===Cultural venues===
At the north end of campus, the university&#x27;s Great Hall Complex comprises three venues open to both students and the public; the Peter Scott Gallery, the Nuffield Theatre and the Lancaster International Concert Series. In 2009, these three organisations were combined as one department by the university – initially termed &#x27;The Public Arts&#x27; but later renamed &#x27;Live at LICA&#x27; – with Matt Fenton overseeing this unification. In August 2015 Live at LICA was rebranded to &#x27;Lancaster Arts at Lancaster University&#x27; to avoid confusion with the department of LICA, then director Jamie Eastman stated that; &quot;This new name and logo communicates who we are, where we are and what we&#x27;re offering.&quot;
The Peter Scott Gallery is open to the public free of charge. The Gallery is located on the Bailrigg campus and houses the university&#x27;s international art collection, which includes Japanese and Chinese art, antiquities, works by twentieth-century British artists including works by artists from the St Ives School, Sir Terry Frost, Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, Barbara Hepworth and William Scott. Among other British artists whose work is represented are Norman Adams, Patrick Caulfield, Elisabeth Frink, Kenneth Martin and Winifred Nicholson. Within the last fifteen years works by Andy Goldsworthy, Peter Howson and Albert Irvin have been acquired. The university collection also includes prints by significant European artists such as Dürer, Miró, Ernst and Vasarely.

Lancaster International Concert Series is the main provider of classical music in north Lancashire and Cumbria. Concerts are held within the Great Hall. Between October and March each year the series offers a varied diet of music which includes: orchestral concerts, chamber music, events for young people, jazz, family concerts and world music.

The Nuffield Theatre, a black box theatre, is one of the largest and most adaptable professional studio theatres in Europe. It presents public performances in the fields of theatre, contemporary dance and live art from some of the best-known and respected companies from the UK and abroad. The focus of the work is new and experimental practice, a focus it shares with many of the teaching and research interest of Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts (LICA). The Nuffield presents up to 30 visiting professional shows a year, plus public performances by students from Theatre Studies, and the university&#x27;s student theatre and dance societies and a range of local community organisations.

The Ruskin - Library, Museum and Research Centre houses archive material related to the poet, author and artist John Ruskin. It is open to the public, although only a small part of the collection is on public display at once. The building was constructed in 1997 by architect Sir Richard MacCormac CBE PPRIBA RA FRSA (1938–2014). The Ruskin Whitehouse Collection housed in The Ruskin is the largest holding of books, manuscripts, photographs, drawings and watercolours by and related to John Ruskin in the world.

===Conference centre===
In 2016 the university purchased the 165-acre Forrest Hills conference centre and golf course, located on the M6 opposite the main campus, which it continues to operate as a conference venue.

==Organisation and administration==

=== Colleges ===

The university has nine colleges. Formerly, these were quasi-autonomous bodies providing for accommodation, welfare, social-life and student discipline, but are currently centrally controlled. All members of the university are members of a college, although in recent years academic staff have had decreasing involvement. Most colleges have about eight or nine hundred members and all on-campus accommodation is linked to a college, with blocks or individual flats being linked to one college or another each year according to demand. The colleges were governed by a syndicate, including a principal (originally a senior academic but nowadays more usually a middle-ranking administrator or IT professional), a Dean and assistant deans (responsible for student discipline), together with a senior advisor, heading a team of College Advisors. These were previously known as Senior Tutor and College Tutors, but the titles were changed in 2011 to Advisor to avoid possible confusion with &quot;Academic Advisors&quot; in students&#x27; academic departments. Collectively, the colleges are run by their individual SCR (Senior Common Room) and JCR (Junior Common Room), the latter being made up of student members of the college.

Prior to the founding of the ninth college, Graduate College, in 1992, the eight colleges housed both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Today all postgraduate students are members of the Graduate College, which was founded to specifically address the needs of postgraduates and provide year-round provision for courses with different term dates. Students on integrated master&#x27;s degrees however are still considered undergraduates and therefore remain in their original colleges.

Seven of the eight undergraduate colleges are named after regions of the traditional county of Lancashire, whilst County College is named after Lancashire County Council which financed its construction.
The college buildings accommodate a number of academic departments, but are primarily social and accommodation facilities, each with its own bar, which forms part of the university&#x27;s Commercial Services and is open when profitable.

=== Academic departments ===

The university is divided into four faculties. Each faculty is led by a Dean, and each academic department by a Head of department.

The various administrative and technical departments that exist outside of the four faculties are collectively known as Professional Services, and include Facilities, Admissions, and the Library.

=== Governance ===

The university is governed by two main statutory bodies: the Council and the Senate.

The council, chaired by the Pro-Chancellor, is the governing body, consisting of mainly lay members along with representatives of staff and students. It is responsible for the proper management and financial solvency of the university, with major policy decisions and corporate strategy being subject to its approval. The majority of Council members are &quot;lay members&quot;; neither staff nor students of the university.

The Senate of the university, chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, is the principal academic authority. It oversees academic management and sets strategy and priorities, including the curriculum and maintenance of standards. Membership of the Senate consists mainly of the Faculty deans, heads of academic departments, and college principals.

Formerly, a body called the University Court provided a public forum where persons from within and outside Lancaster University could raise any matters regarding the university. A majority of the members of the Court represented the local community and other designated bodies with an interest in the work of the university. The final meeting of the Court took place in January 2018, with the university currently planning to replace it with an &quot;Annual Public Meeting&quot;.

==== Visitor ====
The Visitor of the university was Queen Elizabeth II. The visitor is the final arbiter of any dispute within the university, except in those areas where legislation has removed this to the law courts or other ombudsmen. Student complaints and appeals were heard by the visitor until the Higher Education Act 2004 came into force. All student complaints are now heard by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education.

==== Chancellor ====
The Chancellor, currently Alan Milburn, is the formal and ceremonial head of the university.

Former Chancellor Sir Chris Bonington serves as the Chancellor&#x27;s Ambassador, whilst Alistair Burt is the current Pro-Chancellor and chair of the University Council, succeeding Roger Liddle in October 2020.
==== Vice-Chancellor ====
The Vice-Chancellor is the chief academic and executive officer of the university. The Vice-Chancellor is supported by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor, three Pro Vice-Chancellors, and the Provost for Student Experience, Colleges and the Library. Andrew John Schofield was appointed Vice-Chancellor in November 2019, after the resignation of Mark Smith in September 2019. Andy took up the post of Vice-Chancellor on 1 May 2020, with Steve Bradley holding the position of Interim Vice-Chancellor during the interim period.

===Finances===

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Lancaster had a total income of £401.7 million (2022/23 – £381 million) and total expenditure of £290.7 million (2022/23 – £345 million). Key sources of income included £206.8 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £199.3 million), £52.7 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £50.5 million), £48.5 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £46.4 million), £7.7 million from investment income (2022/23 – £4.5 million) and £0.8 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £4 million).

At year end, Lancaster had endowments of £18.9 million (2022/23 – £18.4 million) and total net assets of £493.6 million (2022/23 – £386.6 million).

==Academic profile==

According to the 2017 &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide, approximately 10% of Lancaster&#x27;s undergraduates come from independent schools. In the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 66:10:23 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 51:49.

===Reputation and rankings===
In &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; 10-year (1998–2007) average ranking of British universities based on consistent league table performance, Lancaster was ranked joint 19th overall in the UK. As of recent years, the university has been placed within the top 10 by UK newspaper league tables and in the top 150 worldwide by the main global rankings (see information box for current rankings). It was also ranked the top university in the north-west of England for all ten years of recordings by &quot;The Complete University Guide&quot;.

In 2014, its 50th year, Lancaster University was ranked 10th in the &quot;THE&quot; 100 Under 50, a list of the world&#x27;s best universities under 50 years old. It also appeared in the lists of QS 50 under 50 in all the years before 2014 when it was under 50 years old.

===Joint programmes===
Lancaster University partnered with Sunway University, Malaysia to offer dual awards undergraduate program since 2006.

Lancaster University entered into a dual degree program with the COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CIIT), Lahore. It simultaneously offered two degrees, from CIIT and Lancaster University; graduates would be alumni of both universities. This was the first programme between a UK and a Pakistani university. However, the dual nature of the programme proved problematic and the relationship ended.

A partnership in a new university venture, University Academy 92 was announced in 2017 and began operation in 2019. Lancaster now provides teaching in media, sport, business and psychology at a new campus in Trafford, Greater Manchester. The project was set up by the &#x27;class of 92&#x27; Manchester United soccer players Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes. Lancaster wanted a base in Manchester. &quot;Subtext&quot;, Lancaster&#x27;s in house critical newsletter, asked: &quot;Why are we taking a 40% financial stake and a 100% reputational share of what is essentially a new university set up with a group of retired footballers?&quot; Local opinion on the project was also divided as reached the planning application stage.

=== Programmes abroad ===
In October 2013, Lancaster University announced the opening of a branch campus in Accra, Ghana, to serve the population of Ghana and all of Africa, providing a British university-level education locally to those students. The campus is operated in partnership with Transnational Academic Group Ghana Limited, and offers undergraduate and graduate programmes in management, business, Economics &amp; international relations, Politics &amp; International Relations, Accounting &amp; Finance, Marketing, computer science, law and psychology along with an EMBA programme.

In 2020, Lancaster opened a new branch campus in Germany, Lancaster University Leipzig. The campus is operated in partnership with Navitas. Programmes offered in Leipzig are equivalent to their counterparts in Lancaster, and students receive their degree from Lancaster University upon graduation.

Lancaster opened the Joint Institute for Environmental Research and Education (JIE) in Guangzhou, China in 2016, in partnership with the South China Agricultural University (SCAU). A joint Environmental Science undergraduate degree began in September 2016 with students spending two years at each institution.

The Chinese Ministry of Education gave permission in April 2016 for Lancaster to establish Lancaster University College - Beijing Jiaotong University in Weihai, Shandong province.

=== Research ===

In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework assessment, Lancaster was ranked 18th out of 128 UK universities, including 13th for the percentage of world-leading research. The university places a particular focus on interdisciplinary research, encouraging collaborative research across academic departments.

In 2012, Lancaster University announced a partnership with the UK&#x27;s biggest arms company, (BAE Systems), and four other North-Western universities (Liverpool, Salford, UCLAN and Manchester) in order to work on the Gamma Programme which aims to develop &quot;autonomous systems&quot;. According to the University of Liverpool when referring to the programme, &quot;autonomous systems are technology based solutions that replace humans in tasks that are mundane, dangerous and dirty, or detailed and precise, across sectors, including aerospace, nuclear, automotive and petrochemicals&quot;.

==Student life==

===Students&#x27; Union===

Lancaster University Students&#x27; Union (LUSU) is the representative body of students at the university. Unusually, there is no main union building. Instead, the union is organised through the eight college JCRs, each of which has its own social venues and meeting spaces. The union is, however, allocated an administration building by the university. &quot;SCAN&quot; (acronym for &quot;Student Comments And News&quot;) is the union&#x27;s newspaper and was established in 1967. LUSU owns a dual-room, 1,100 capacity nightclub in Lancaster called The Sugarhouse (which survived an attempt to close it in 2019); operates a shop on campus, LUSU Shop; and also an off campus housing agency LUSU Living.

LUSU also helps to support LUSU Involve, a volunteering unit allowing Lancaster University students to become involved with communities locally and internationally.

There are over 175 different societies operating within Lancaster University. Common areas include sports, hobbies, politics, academic, culture and religion. There are several fairs during the Freshers period in which various clubs and societies promote themselves.

===Chancellor&#x27;s Wharf===

Chancellor&#x27;s Wharf is off-campus student accommodation. It consists of three buildings by the Lancaster canal on Aldcliffe Road. The location is near the city centre, opposite &#x27;the Water Witch&#x27; pub and the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. It is open to members of all of the university&#x27;s colleges. Residents remain members of their various colleges, with Chancellor&#x27;s Wharf itself being only a hall of residence.
===Sport===

Every summer term the students take part in the Roses Tournament against the University of York, this is often described as the biggest varsity competition in Europe. The venue of the event alternates annually between Lancaster and York. The competition takes its name from the 15th-century civil war, the War of the Roses, and is organised by the universities&#x27; respective student unions, LUSU and YUSU.

Lancaster University Athletics Club (LUAC) was formed in May 2011. The start of the 2011/12 academic year saw the first athletes join the club and by the end of the year receive awards for LUSU &#x27;Society of the Year 2012&#x27; and were winners of the Lancaster Athletics Cup 2012. In the 2012/13 academic year the club was given the opportunity to compete in BUCS and Roses along with other sporting societies at Lancaster University.

Lancaster University Swimming and Water Polo Club (LUSWP, formally known as LUST) competes in both BUCS and Roses in the sports swimming and water polo. The swimming team also competes in other charity galas, such as Quest for The Crest, held at Manchester Aquatics Centre. The BUCS swimming competitions include BUCS Short Course National Championships, BUCS Team Championships, and BUCS Long Course Championships, of which there has recently been attendance from Olympic swimmers such as James Guy and 50m &amp; 100m World Champion Adam Peaty. In addition, the water polo team competes in the UPOLO league. LUSWP won the Lancaster University &#x27;Club of the Year&#x27; in both academic years 2015/2016, and 2016/2017.

==== Intercollegiate sport ====
A number of intercollegiate sporting events exist within the university. Leagues exist in football, netball, pool, darts and dominoes. Pool, darts and dominoes collectively form an overall &quot;bar sports&quot; league known as the George Wyatt Cup. The Carter Shield is contested between every college with bi-weekly matches open to all, and is intended as a light-hearted competition to promote lesser-known sports.

There are also a number of annual sporting events between specific colleges:
* Founders is contested every year between Bowland and Lonsdale, the two oldest colleges at the university. The competition was created in 2004 to ensure that the friendly rivalry between the two colleges would continue after Lonsdale&#x27;s relocation meant they would no longer be neighbours. The 2018 Founders series was officially cancelled after disagreements between the two colleges, but continued unofficially under the tongue-in-cheek name &quot;Undergrounders&quot;.
* Legends was formerly contested between Grizedale, County, Pendle and Fylde colleges. Following Fylde and subsequently County&#x27;s withdrawal in 2017, it was replaced by Titans (County/Fylde) and Warriors (Grizedale/Pendle).
* Patriots is contested between Furness and Cartmel Colleges.

===Arts, media and culture===

Alongside sport, Lancaster University has a vast selection of arts societies across campus in the areas of performance, media and music. Examples of performance-based societies include Lancaster University Theatre Group (LUTG), the Comedy Institute, Lancaster University Film Production (LUFP), University of Lancaster Music society (ULMS), and HipHop and Breakdance. There is also the Vagina Monolancs, a student-run group performing the Vagina Monologues, raising awareness of domestic violence against women and girls. In addition, the four established student media groups consist of the student radio station Bailrigg FM, the student newspaper SCAN established in 1967 and the student union&#x27;s television station LA1TV as well as Take 2 Cinema, an on-campus cinema, based in Bowland Main Lecture Theatre which was established in 1964.

===Religious groups===

The Lancaster University Chaplaincy Centre is located at the north end of campus incorporating various religious groups such as Christian (Anglicans, Catholics, Orthodox, Quakers), Jewish, Buddhist, and Hindu as well as various religious societies including the Bahá&#x27;í, the Chinese Christian Fellowship, the Postgrad and Mature Students Group, and the Pagan society which hold regular events and meetings. The Islamic Prayer Rooms are located across from the Chaplaincy Centre, in Ash House.

<text>Western Armenian ( ) is one of the two standardized forms of Modern Armenian, the other being Eastern Armenian. It is based mainly on the Istanbul Armenian dialect, as opposed to Eastern Armenian, which is mainly based on the Yerevan Armenian dialect.

Until the early 20th century, various Western Armenian dialects were spoken in the Ottoman Empire, predominantly in the historically Armenian populated regions of Western Armenia. The dialectal varieties of Western Armenian currently in use include Homshetsi, spoken by the Hemshin peoples; the dialects of Armenians in Kessab, Latakia and Jisr al-Shughur in Syria, Anjar in Lebanon, and Istanbul and Vakıflı, in Turkey (part of the &quot;Sueidia&quot; dialect). The Sasun and Mush dialects are also spoken in modern-day Armenian villages such as Bazmaberd and Sasnashen. The Cilician dialect is also spoken in Cyprus, where it is taught in Armenian schools (Nareg), and is the first language of about 3,000 people of Armenian descent.

Forms of the Karin dialect of Western Armenian are spoken by several hundred thousand people in Northern Armenia, mostly in Gyumri, Artik, Akhuryan, and around 130 villages in the Shirak province, and by Armenians in Samtskhe–Javakheti province of Georgia (Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe).

A mostly diasporic language and one that is not an official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries. According to Ethnologue, there are 1.58 million native speakers of Western Armenian, primarily in Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Lebanon, and Iraq. The language is classified as 6b (i.e., threatened, with interruptions in intergenerational transmission).

==Classification==
Western Armenian is an Indo-European language belonging to the Armenic branch of the family, alongside Eastern and Classical Armenian. According to &quot;Glottolog,&quot; Antioch, Artial, Asia Minor, Bolu, Hamshenic, Kilikien, Mush-Tigranakert, Stanoz, Vanic and Yozgat are the main dialects of Western Armenian.

Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian are, for the most part, mutually intelligible for educated or literate users of the other, while illiterate or semiliterate users of lower registers of each one may have difficulty understanding the other variant. One phonological difference is that voiced stops in Eastern Armenian are voiceless in Western Armenian.

==Speakers==
Western Armenian is spoken by Armenians of most of the Southeastern Europe and Middle East except for Iran, and Rostov-on-Don in Russia. It is a moribund language spoken by only a small percentage of Armenians in Turkey (especially in Istanbul) as a first language, with 18 percent among the community in general and 8 percent among younger people. There are notable diaspora L2 Western Armenian speakers in Lebanon (Beirut), Syria (Aleppo, Damascus), California (Fresno, Los Angeles), and France (Marseilles).

Western Armenian used to be the dominant Armenian variety, but as a result of the Armenian genocide, the speakers of Western Armenian were mostly murdered or exiled. Those who fled to Eastern Armenia now speak either Eastern Armenian or have a diglossic situation between Western Armenian dialects in informal usage and an Eastern Armenian standard. The only Western Armenian dialect still spoken in Western Armenia is the Homshetsi dialect, since the Hemshin peoples, who were Muslim converts, did not fall victim to the Armenian genocide.

Western Armenian isn&#x27;t just predominant for Armenian&#x27;s in the Middle East, the Armenians living in Southeastern Europe/Balkans, mostly Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey (Istanbul) are Western Armenian speakers, who immigrated of the Armenian Genocide. Historically there was presence of Western Armenians (Cilicians) in Moldova. 

On 21 February 2009, International Mother Language Day, a new edition of the &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot; was released by UNESCO in which the Western Armenian language in Turkey was defined as a definitely endangered language.

== Modern day speakers ==
In modern day Armenia, there is a municipality called Gyumri, the city took host to large numbers of Armenian refugees fleeing the Ottoman Empire from the Armenian Genocide. Many of these people spoke the Karin dialect of Armenian, which is spoken in Gyumri but overtime many Eastern Armenian and Russian words have been borrowed into the dialect. There was also a wave of Armenians coming from the Middle East who were Western Armenian, who moved to the Soviet Union, mostly in Soviet Armenia. Many have assimilated into the Eastern Armenian dialect.

=== Endangerment and controversy ===
With Western Armenian being declared an endangered language, there has been recent pushback on reviving the language in Los Angeles, which is home to the largest concentration of Western Armenians.

Shushan Karapetian, in her evaluation of both the Eastern and Western dialects of Armenian, concludes that heritage languages, in the face of an English dominant society, rapidly die out within no more than 2 generations, calling America a &quot;linguistic graveyard.&quot; In US census data, the percentage of people of Armenian ancestry who speak Western Armenian at home has rapidly declined, down from 25% in 1980 to 16% in 2000.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

====Monophthongs====
Western Armenian has eight monophthongs.

====Diphthongs====
Western Armenian has ten environments in which two vowels in the orthography appear next to each other, called diphthongs. By definition, they appear in the same syllable. For those unfamiliar with IPA symbols, represents the English &quot;y&quot; sound. The Armenian letter &quot;ե&quot; is often used in combinations such as (ya) and (yo). If used at the beginning of a word, &quot;ե&quot; alone is sufficient to represent (as in yes). The Armenian letter &quot;յ&quot; is used for the glide after vowels. The IPA (like English long i) and diphthongs are common, while (English long a), (a stretched-out long e), and (oy) are rare. The following examples are sometimes across syllable and morpheme boundaries, and gliding is then expected:

===Consonants===
This is the Western Armenian Consonantal System using letters from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), followed by the corresponding Armenian letter in brackets.

The in Armenian is rare; the letter &quot;ֆ&quot; was added to the alphabet much later. The glide is not used except for foreign proper nouns, like Washington (by utilizing the &quot;u&quot; vowel, Armenian &quot;ու&quot;).

====Differences from Classical Armenian====
Differences in phonology between Western Armenian and Classical Armenian include the distinction of stops and affricates.

Firstly, while Classical Armenian has a three-way distinction of stops and affricates (one voiced and two voiceless: one plain and one aspirated), Western Armenian has kept only a two-way distinction (one voiced and one aspirated). For example, Classical Armenian has three bilabial stops ( , , and ), but Western Armenian has only two bilabial stops ( and /).

Secondly, Western Armenian has both changed the Classical Armenian voiced stops and voiced affricates to aspirated stops and &quot;aspirated&quot; affricates and replaced the plain stops and affricates with voiced consonants.

Specifically, here are the shifts from Classical Armenian to Western Armenian:
# Bilabial stops:
## merging of Classical Armenian and as 
## voicing of Classical to 
# Alveolar stops:
## merging of Classical Armenian and as 
## voicing of Classical to 
# Velar stops:
## merging of Classical Armenian and as 
## voicing of Classical to 
# Alveolar affricates:
## merging of Classical Armenian and as 
## voicing of Classical to 
# Post-alveolar affricates:
## merging of Classical Armenian and as 
## voicing of Classical to 

As a result, a word like &#x27;water&#x27; (spelled in Classical Armenian) is cognate with Western Armenian (also spelled ). However, &#x27;grandson&#x27; and &#x27;stone&#x27; are pronounced similarly in both Classical and Western Armenian.

==Orthography==

Western Armenian uses Classical Armenian orthography, also known as traditional &quot;Mashtotsian&quot; orthography. The Armenian orthography reform, commonly known as the &quot;Abeghian&quot; orthography, was introduced in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and is still used by most Eastern Armenian speakers from modern Armenia. However, it has not been adopted by Eastern Armenian speakers of Iran and their diaspora or by speakers of Western Armenian, with the exception of periodical publications published in Romania and Bulgaria while under Communist regimes.

==Morphology==
===Nouns===
Western Armenian nouns have four grammatical cases: nominative-accusative (subject / direct object), genitive-dative (possession / indirect object), ablative (origin) and instrumental (means). Of the six cases, the nominative and accusative are the same, except for personal pronouns, and the genitive and dative are the same, meaning that nouns have four distinct forms for case. Nouns in Armenian also decline for number (singular and plural).

Declension in Armenian is based on how the genitive is formed, since all other cases are consistent. There are several declensions, but one is dominant (the genitive in &quot;i&quot;) while a half-dozen other forms are in gradual decline and are being replaced by the &quot;i&quot;-form, which has virtually attained the status of a regular form:



===Articles===
Like English and some other languages, Armenian has definite and indefinite articles. The indefinite article in Western Armenian is , which follows the noun:

&quot;ator mə&quot; (&#x27;a chair&#x27;, Nom.sg), &quot;atori mə&quot; (&#x27;of a chair&#x27;, Gen.sg)

The definite article is a suffix attached to the noun, and is one of two forms, either -n (when the final sound is a vowel) or -ə (when the final sound is a consonant). When the word is followed by al (ալ = also, too), the conjunction u (ու), or the present or imperfect conjugated forms of the verb em (to be); however, it will always take -n:

: &quot;kirkə&quot; (&#x27;the book&#x27;, Nom.sg)
: &quot;karin&quot; (&#x27;the barley&#x27; Nom.sg)
but:
: &quot;As kirkn e&quot; (&#x27;This is the book&#x27;)
: &quot;Parin u charə&quot; (&#x27;The good and the bad&#x27;)
: &quot;Inkn al&quot; (&#x27;S/he too&#x27;)

The indefinite article becomes mən when it is followed by al (ալ = also, too) or the Present or imperfect conjugated forms of the verb em (to be):

: &quot;kirk mə&quot; (&#x27;a book&#x27;, Nom.sg)
but:
: &quot;As kirk mən e&quot; (&#x27;This is a book&#x27;)
: &quot;Kirk mən al&quot; (&#x27;A book as well&#x27;)

===Adjectives===
Adjectives in Armenian do not decline for case or number, and precede the noun:

: &quot;agheg martə&quot; (&#x27;the good man&#x27;, Nom.sg)
: &quot;agheg martun&quot; (&#x27;to the good man&#x27;, Gen.sg)

===Verbs===

Verbs in Armenian are based on two basic series of forms, a &quot;present&quot; form and an &quot;imperfect&quot; form. From this, all other tenses and moods are formed with various particles and constructions. There is a third form, the preterite, which in Armenian is a tense in its own right, and takes no other particles or constructions.

The &quot;present&quot; tense in Western Armenian is based on three conjugations (a, e, i):

The present tense (as we know it in English) is made by adding the particle gə before the &quot;present&quot; form, except the defective verbs &quot;em&quot; (I am), &quot;gam&quot; (I exist, I&#x27;m there), &quot;unim&quot; (I have), &quot;kidem&quot; (I know) and &quot;gərnam&quot; (I can), while the future is made by adding bidi:

: &quot;Yes kirk′ə gə gartam&quot; (I am reading the book or I read the book, Pres)
: &quot;Yes kirk′ə bidi gartam &quot;(I will read the book, Fut).

For the exceptions: (I shall be, have, know, be able).
In vernacular language, the particle &quot;gor&quot; is added after the verb to indicate present progressive tense. The distinction is not made in literary Armenian.

: (I am reading the book)

The verb without any particles constitutes the subjunctive mood, such as &quot;if I eat, should I eat, that I eat, I wish I eat&quot;:

===Personal pronouns===
In informal speech, the accusative case has merged with the dative case, so the accusative of &#x27;I&#x27; would be ինծի, the accusative of &#x27;you&#x27; would be քեզի, and so on. Speech which retains the accusative is usually seen as more formal and prestigious.
===Demonstrative pronouns===
===Relative pronouns===
The accusative case is hardly seen in both formal and informal speech; it has merged with the dative.

<text>The National Council (; ; ; ) is the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, with the upper house being the Council of States. Containing 200 seats, the National Council is the larger of the two houses.

Adult citizens elect the council&#x27;s members, who are called National Councillors, for four year terms. These members are apportioned to the Swiss cantons in proportion to their population. Both houses meet in the Federal Palace of Switzerland in Bern.

==Organisation==
With 200 members, the National Council is the larger house of the Swiss legislature. It represents the people, the vote of each citizen having more or less the same weight, whereas the Council of States represents the cantons - each of them having the same weight, regardless of its population.

When the Swiss federation was founded in 1848, the number of seats was not yet fixed, and was thus determined by the population of the individual cantons. According to the provisions of the federal constitution at that time, a canton was to receive one National Council member for every 20,000 citizens. Thus, the first National Council, which met in 1848, had 111 members.

In 1963, the number of members was fixed at 200. The division of the seats between the individual cantons is determined by each canton&#x27;s percentage of the national population, as revealed in the national census (including foreign residents), using the largest remainder method. A change in the division of the seats occurred in 2003, as a result of the 2000 census.

Every canton is entitled to at least one seat in the National Council.

Unlike the upper house where no translation is provided, simultaneous translation is provided into German, French, and Italian, but not Romansh.

==Electoral system==
Under the Swiss Federal Constitution, elections for the National Council are held every four years by the Swiss people. The most recent election took place on Sunday, 22 October 2023.

Since a popular initiative in 1918, elections have been by proportional representation, in which each canton forms an electoral district (&quot;Wahlkreis&quot;). There is no election threshold. Since 1971 women have been entitled to vote and stand in National Council elections.

Since the reform of the census system and the adoption of the use of government administrative data for determining the population in 2007, the distribution of the seats in the National Council between the cantons has been based on the permanent resident population (including residents who are not entitled to vote) in the year following the most recent federal election. There is a proviso that each canton is entitled to at least one seat.

The number of seats given to the cantons which are entitled to more than one seat is determined using the largest remainder method.
Cantons which are only entitled to send one councillor to the National Council elect the candidate who wins a majority of votes.

The cantons use a unique system of proportional representation, sometimes called a &quot;free list&quot;. Each citizen may cast as many votes as there are seats available to their constituency, and may even cast up to two votes for the same candidate. For every vote received by a candidate, that candidate&#x27;s party also receives a vote. Voters also list a party vote, in which all blank candidate votes contribute towards the party&#x27;s total.
In elections, political parties publish lists in the cantons with their candidates. Each list contains at most the number of candidates which the canton is entitled to send to the National Council.
In addition, each party can produce multiple lists to the canton (e.g. men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, youth, or seniors&#x27; lists; in larger cantons they might offer lists for individual cities or districts). It is also possible for several parties to enter a single shared list.
Voters may choose a pre-prepared party list without making changes or they can alter it by cumulative voting or panachage. Thus, the voter can give his vote to a specific candidate and ignore the rest of that candidate&#x27;s party. Alternatively, it is possible for the voter to split his or her vote among several candidates from different parties.

The seats are then apportioned using the Hagenbach-Bischoff System. This system is unique in that it allows voters to split their vote across different parties, depending on which candidate the voter prefers.

===Fictional voter===
To determine a party&#x27;s strength, the notion of &quot;fictional voter&quot; was introduced and is defined by the Swiss Federal Statistical Institute as: number of votes obtained by party A * (number of valid ballots / number of valid votes). Individual voters can choose to make fewer than the permissible number of votes. The number of valid votes / number of valid ballots closely matches the number of deputies a canton needs to elect. More exactly, this number represents the average number of valid votes per voter. The formula can then be summed up by: number of votes obtained by party A / average of valid votes per voters.

The result is the number of fictional voters for a given party in a given canton. A total number of fictional voters can then be established and the party strength can be deduced.

The number of deputies in each party is determined at the cantonal level using proportional representation with the Hagenbach-Bischoff system (except in single-member cantons.) The election&#x27;s turnout is computed as: number of valid ballots cast / number of registered voters.

==Role==

The role and powers of the National Council are regulated by the Parliament Act (ParlA) and the Title 5 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The National Council, together with the Council of States, forms the Federal Parliament and exercises the highest legal authority in Switzerland, subject to the rights of the people and the cantons. Both chambers of the Federal Parliament are called &quot;councils&quot; (&quot;Räte&quot;). The National Council and the Council of States do not meet daily, but meet regularly for sessions. Usually, there are four sessions in a year, each lasting three weeks, with between two and five sittings per week. The spring session (&quot;Frühjahrssession&quot;) begins on the first Monday in March, the summer session (&quot;Sommersession&quot;) on the first Monday in June, the Autumn session (&quot;Herbstsession&quot;) after the Federal Day, and the winter session (&quot;Wintersession&quot;) on the last Monday in November. During the sessions, proposed legislation is debated. If there is not enough time in the regular sessions, an extra session can be convened. In special situations (political crises, wars, etc.) a quarter of the members of one of the two councils or the Federal Council can convene an extraordinary session. To date, there have been eight extraordinary sessions, most of them called by the social democratic parliamentary group.

==Powers==
The National Council and the Council of States are constitutionally completely equal - a bill is only law when it has been accepted by both councils in the same version. All business is considered by both councils in turn. The presidents of the councils decide together which council will handle a given matter first (&quot;Erstrat&quot;).

Sometimes, after the first reading, the National Council and the Council of States end up producing different texts, in which case a difference resolution procedure takes place, in which the bill is sent back and forth between the two councils. After a bill has been sent back three successive times, the two councils must meet together to discuss the matter.

Each year the National Council elects a , who leads sessions of the National Council and joint sessions of the National Council and the Council of States.

<text>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury is a senior ministerial office in the government of the United Kingdom and is the second most senior ministerial office in HM Treasury, after the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The office holder is always a full member or attendee of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

The office was created in 1961 to share the burden of representing HM Treasury with the chancellor.

The minister is shadowed by the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury who sits on the Official Opposition frontbench.

==History and responsibilities==
Between 1961 and 2015, the holder of the office of Chief Secretary to the Treasury was of full cabinet rank. This formally made HM Treasury the only department to have more than one ministerial position of cabinet rank.

The office holder is responsible for public expenditure, including spending reviews.

<doc id="316993" wikidata="Q910678" url="?curid=316993" title="Emulsion polymerization">
<text>In polymer chemistry, emulsion polymerization is a type of radical polymerization that usually starts with an emulsion incorporating water, monomers, and surfactants. The most common type of emulsion polymerization is an oil-in-water emulsion, in which droplets of monomer (the oil) are emulsified (with surfactants) in a continuous phase of water. Water-soluble polymers, such as certain polyvinyl alcohols or hydroxyethyl celluloses, can also be used to act as emulsifiers/stabilizers. The name &quot;emulsion polymerization&quot; is a misnomer that arises from a historical misconception. Rather than occurring in emulsion droplets, polymerization takes place in the latex/colloid particles that form spontaneously in the first few minutes of the process. These latex particles are typically 100 nm in size, and are made of many individual polymer chains. The particles are prevented from coagulating with each other because each particle is surrounded by the surfactant (&#x27;soap&#x27;); the charge on the surfactant repels other particles electrostatically. When water-soluble polymers are used as stabilizers instead of soap, the repulsion between particles arises because these water-soluble polymers form a &#x27;hairy layer&#x27; around a particle that repels other particles, because pushing particles together would involve compressing these chains.

Emulsion polymerization is used to make several commercially important polymers. Many of these polymers are used as solid materials and must be isolated from the aqueous dispersion after polymerization. In other cases the dispersion itself is the end product. A dispersion resulting from emulsion polymerization is often called a latex (especially if derived from a synthetic rubber) or an emulsion (even though &quot;emulsion&quot; strictly speaking refers to a dispersion of an immiscible liquid in water). These emulsions find applications in adhesives, paints, paper coating and textile coatings. They are often preferred over solvent-based products in these applications due to the absence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in them.

Advantages of emulsion polymerization include:
*High molecular weight polymers can be made at fast polymerization rates. By contrast, in bulk and solution free-radical polymerization, there is a tradeoff between molecular weight and polymerization rate.
*The continuous water phase is an excellent conductor of heat, enabling fast polymerization rates without loss of temperature control.
*Since polymer molecules are contained within the particles, the viscosity of the reaction medium remains close to that of water and is not dependent on molecular weight.
*The final product can be used as is and does not generally need to be altered or processed.

Disadvantages of emulsion polymerization include:
*Surfactants and other polymerization adjuvants remain in the polymer or are difficult to remove
*For dry (isolated) polymers, water removal is an energy-intensive process
*Emulsion polymerizations are usually designed to operate at high conversion of monomer to polymer. This can result in significant chain transfer to polymer.
*Can not be used for condensation, ionic, or Ziegler-Natta polymerization, although some exceptions are known.

==History==
The early history of emulsion polymerization is connected with the field of synthetic rubber. The idea of using an emulsified monomer in an aqueous suspension or emulsion was first conceived at Bayer, before World War I, in an attempt to prepare synthetic rubber. The impetus for this development was the observation that natural rubber is produced at room temperature in dispersed particles stabilized by colloidal polymers, so the industrial chemists tried to duplicate these conditions. The Bayer workers used naturally occurring polymers such as gelatin, ovalbumin, and starch to stabilize their dispersion. By today&#x27;s definition these were not true emulsion polymerizations, but suspension polymerizations.

The first &quot;true&quot; emulsion polymerizations, which used a surfactant and polymerization initiator, were conducted in the 1920s to polymerize isoprene. Over the next twenty years, through the end of World War II, efficient methods for production of several forms of synthetic rubber by emulsion polymerization were developed, but relatively few publications in the scientific literature appeared: most disclosures were confined to patents or were kept secret due to wartime needs.

After World War II, emulsion polymerization was extended to production of plastics. Manufacture of dispersions to be used in latex paints and other products sold as liquid dispersions commenced. Ever more sophisticated processes were devised to prepare products that replaced solvent-based materials. Ironically, synthetic rubber manufacture turned more and more away from emulsion polymerization as new organometallic catalysts were developed that allowed much better control of polymer architecture.

==Theoretical overview==
The first successful theory to explain the distinct features of emulsion polymerization was developed by Smith and Ewart, and Harkins in the 1940s, based on their studies of polystyrene. Smith and Ewart arbitrarily divided the mechanism of emulsion polymerization into three stages or intervals. Subsequently, it has been recognized that not all monomers or systems undergo these particular three intervals. Nevertheless, the Smith-Ewart description is a useful starting point to analyze emulsion polymerizations.

The Smith-Ewart-Harkins theory for the mechanism of free-radical emulsion polymerization is summarized by the following steps:
* A monomer is dispersed or emulsified in a solution of surfactant and water, forming relatively large droplets in water.
* Excess surfactant creates micelles in the water.
* Small amounts of monomer diffuse through the water to the micelle.
* A water-soluble initiator is introduced into the water phase where it reacts with monomer in the micelles. (This characteristic differs from suspension polymerization where an oil-soluble initiator dissolves in the monomer, followed by polymer formation in the monomer droplets themselves.) This is considered Smith-Ewart interval 1.
* The total surface area of the micelles is much greater than the total surface area of the fewer, larger monomer droplets; therefore the initiator typically reacts in the micelle and not the monomer droplet.
* Monomer in the micelle quickly polymerizes and the growing chain terminates. At this point the monomer-swollen micelle has turned into a polymer particle. When both monomer droplets and polymer particles are present in the system, this is considered Smith-Ewart interval 2. 
* More monomer from the droplets diffuses to the growing particle, where more initiators will eventually react.
* Eventually the free monomer droplets disappear and all remaining monomer is located in the particles. This is considered Smith-Ewart interval 3.
* Depending on the particular product and monomer, additional monomer and initiator may be continuously and slowly added to maintain their levels in the system as the particles grow.
* The final product is a dispersion of polymer particles in water. It can also be known as a polymer colloid, a latex, or commonly and inaccurately as an &#x27;emulsion&#x27;.

Smith-Ewart theory does not predict the specific polymerization behavior when the monomer is somewhat water-soluble, like methyl methacrylate or vinyl acetate. In these cases homogeneous nucleation occurs: particles are formed without the presence or need for surfactant micelles.

High molecular weights are developed in emulsion polymerization because the concentration of growing chains within each polymer particle is very low. In conventional radical polymerization, the concentration of growing chains is higher, which leads to termination by coupling, which ultimately results in shorter polymer chains. The original Smith-Ewart-Hawkins mechanism required each particle to contain either zero or one growing chain. Improved understanding of emulsion polymerization has relaxed that criterion to include more than one growing chain per particle, however, the number of growing chains per particle is still considered to be very low.

Because of the complex chemistry that occurs during an emulsion polymerization, including polymerization kinetics and particle formation kinetics, quantitative understanding of the mechanism of emulsion polymerization has required extensive computer simulation. Robert Gilbert has summarized a recent theory.

==More detailed treatment of Smith-Ewart theory==

=== Interval 1 ===
When radicals generated in the aqueous phase encounter the monomer within the micelle, they initiate polymerization. The conversion of monomer to polymer within the micelle lowers the monomer concentration and generates a monomer concentration gradient. Consequently, the monomer from monomer droplets and uninitiated micelles begin to diffuse to the growing, polymer-containing, particles. Those micelles that did not encounter a radical during the earlier stage of conversion begin to disappear, losing their monomer and surfactant to the growing particles. The theory predicts that after the end of this interval, the number of growing polymer particles remains constant.

=== Interval 2 ===
This interval is also known as steady state reaction stage. Throughout this stage, monomer droplets act as reservoirs supplying monomer to the growing polymer particles by diffusion through the water. While at steady state, the ratio of free radicals per particle can be divided into three cases. When the number of free radicals per particle is less than , this is called Case 1. When the number of free radicals per particle equals , this is called Case 2. And when there is greater than radical per particle, this is called Case 3. Smith-Ewart theory predicts that Case 2 is the predominant scenario for the following reasons. A monomer-swollen particle that has been struck by a radical contains one growing chain. Because only one radical (at the end of the growing polymer chain) is present, the chain cannot terminate, and it will continue to grow until a second initiator radical enters the particle. As the rate of termination is much greater than the rate of propagation, and because the polymer particles are extremely small, chain growth is terminated immediately after the entrance of the second initiator radical. The particle then remains dormant until a third initiator radical enters, initiating the growth of a second chain. Consequently, the polymer particles in this case either have zero radicals (dormant state), or 1 radical (polymer growing state) and a very short period of 2 radicals (terminating state) which can be ignored for the free radicals per particle calculation. At any given time, a micelle contains either one growing chain or no growing chains (assumed to be equally probable). Thus, on average, there is around 1/2 radical per particle, leading to the Case 2 scenario. The polymerization rate in this stage can be expressed by

formula_1where formula_2 is the homogeneous propagation rate constant for polymerization within the particles and formula_3 is the equilibrium monomer concentration within a particle. formula_4 represents the overall concentration of polymerizing radicals in the reaction. For Case 2, where the average number of free radicals per micelle are formula_5, formula_4 can be calculated in following expression:

formula_7where formula_8 is number concentration of micelles (number of micelles per unit volume), and formula_9 is the Avogadro constant (). Consequently, the rate of polymerization is then

formula_10

=== Interval 3 ===

Separate monomer droplets disappear as the reaction continues. Polymer particles in this stage may be sufficiently large enough that they contain more than 1 radical per particle.

==Process considerations==
Emulsion polymerizations have been used in batch, semi-batch, and continuous processes. The choice depends on the properties desired in the final polymer or dispersion and on the economics of the product. Modern process control schemes have enabled the development of complex reaction processes, with ingredients such as initiator, monomer, and surfactant added at the beginning, during, or at the end of the reaction.

Early styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) recipes are examples of true batch processes: all ingredients added at the same time to the reactor. Semi-batch recipes usually include a programmed feed of monomer to the reactor. This enables a starve-fed reaction to ensure a good distribution of monomers into the polymer backbone chain. Continuous processes have been used to manufacture various grades of synthetic rubber.

Some polymerizations are stopped before all the monomer has reacted. This minimizes chain transfer to polymer. In such cases the monomer must be removed or stripped from the dispersion.

Colloidal stability is a factor in design of an emulsion polymerization process. For dry or isolated products, the polymer dispersion must be isolated, or converted into solid form. This can be accomplished by simple heating of the dispersion until all water evaporates. More commonly, the dispersion is destabilized (sometimes called &quot;broken&quot;) by addition of a multivalent cation. Alternatively, acidification will destabilize a dispersion with a carboxylic acid surfactant. These techniques may be employed in combination with application of shear to increase the rate of destabilization. After isolation of the polymer, it is usually washed, dried, and packaged.

By contrast, products sold as a dispersion are designed with a high degree of colloidal stability. Colloidal properties such as particle size, particle size distribution, and viscosity are of critical importance to the performance of these dispersions.

Living polymerization processes that are carried out via emulsion polymerization such as iodine-transfer polymerization and RAFT have been developed.

Controlled coagulation techniques can enable better control of the particle size and distribution.

==Components==

===Monomers===
Typical monomers are those that undergo radical polymerization, are liquid or gaseous at reaction conditions, and are poorly soluble in water. Solid monomers are difficult to disperse in water. If monomer solubility is too high, particle formation may not occur and the reaction kinetics reduce to that of solution polymerization.

Ethene and other simple olefins must be polymerized at very high pressures (up to 800 bar).

===Comonomers===
Copolymerization is common in emulsion polymerization. The same rules and comonomer pairs that exist in radical polymerization operate in emulsion polymerization. However, copolymerization kinetics are greatly influenced by the aqueous solubility of the monomers. Monomers with greater aqueous solubility will tend to partition in the aqueous phase and not in the polymer particle. They will not get incorporated as readily in the polymer chain as monomers with lower aqueous solubility. This can be avoided by a programmed addition of monomer using a semi-batch process.

Ethene and other alkenes are used as minor comonomers in emulsion polymerization, notably in vinyl acetate copolymers.

Small amounts of acrylic acid or other ionizable monomers are sometimes used to confer colloidal stability to a dispersion.

===Initiators===
Both thermal and redox generation of free radicals have been used in emulsion polymerization. Persulfate salts are commonly used in both initiation modes. The persulfate ion readily breaks up into sulfate radical ions above about 50 °C, providing a thermal source of initiation. Redox initiation takes place when an oxidant such as a persulfate salt, a reducing agent such as glucose, Rongalite, or sulfite, and a redox catalyst such as an iron compound are all included in the polymerization recipe. Redox recipes are not limited by temperature and are used for polymerizations that take place below 50 °C.

Although organic peroxides and hydroperoxides are used in emulsion polymerization, initiators are usually water soluble and partition into the water phase. This enables the particle generation behavior described in the theory section. In redox initiation, either the oxidant or the reducing agent (or both) must be water-soluble, but one component can be water-insoluble.

===Surfactants===
Selection of the correct surfactant is critical to the development of any emulsion polymerization process. The surfactant must enable a fast rate of polymerization, minimize coagulum or fouling in the reactor and other process equipment, prevent an unacceptably high viscosity during polymerization (which leads to poor heat transfer), and maintain or even improve properties in the final product such as tensile strength, gloss, and water absorption.

Anionic, nonionic, and cationic surfactants have been used, although anionic surfactants are by far most prevalent. Surfactants with a low critical micelle concentration (CMC) are favored; the polymerization rate shows a dramatic increase when the surfactant level is above the CMC, and minimization of the surfactant is preferred for economic reasons and the (usually) adverse effect of surfactant on the physical properties of the resulting polymer. Mixtures of surfactants are often used, including mixtures of anionic with nonionic surfactants. Mixtures of cationic and anionic surfactants form insoluble salts and are not useful.

Examples of surfactants commonly used in emulsion polymerization include fatty acids, sodium lauryl sulfate, and alpha-olefin sulfonate.

===Non-surfactant stabilizers===
Some grades of polyvinyl alcohol and other water-soluble polymers can promote emulsion polymerization even though they do not typically form micelles and do not act as surfactants (for example, they do not lower surface tension). It is believed that growing polymer chains graft onto these water-soluble polymers, which stabilize the resulting particles.

Dispersions prepared with such stabilizers typically exhibit excellent colloidal stability (for example, dry powders may be mixed into the dispersion without causing coagulation). However, they often result in products that are very water sensitive due to the presence of the water-soluble polymer.

===Other ingredients===
Other ingredients found in emulsion polymerization include chain transfer agents, buffering agents, and inert salts. Preservatives are added to products sold as liquid dispersions to retard bacterial growth. These are usually added after polymerization, however.

==Applications==
Polymers produced by emulsion polymerization can roughly be divided into three categories.

<text>Lancaster University Chaplaincy Centre, on the campus of Lancaster University in the United Kingdom brings together the many faith groups represented on the campus and in the wider community.

== History ==
When the university was being designed, the architect Gabriel Epstein suggested a site to the north-west of Alexandra Square for a chapel, potentially linked to University House. The Anglican Bishop of Blackburn, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Lancaster, and the Rev. G. A. Maland (representing the free churches) held discussions together and agreed to retain the Preston-based firm Cassidy &amp; Ashton, who specialised in religious buildings, as architects. Later, these churches were joined by the Jewish community, and the University Grants Committee agreed to help with the cost of fees and fittings for the social areas.

Built in 1968−1969, the Chaplaincy Centre consists of three circular lobes with a three pronged spire, intended to embody an aspirational ecumenical spirit and representing the coming together of the three Christian denominations of Anglicanism, Catholicism and Nonconformism. The Chaplaincy Centre&#x27;s spire was the basis of the university&#x27;s 1989 logo, introduced in the university&#x27;s silver jubilee.

Similar facilities exist at the universities of Dundee and Bath. However, very few universities in the United Kingdom have such purpose built facilities. Lancaster was the first such joint centre in the United Kingdom.

== Interior details ==
At the insistence of the Catholic Diocese of Lancaster, the Catholic chapel is separate to the chapel used by Anglicans and Nonconformists, but moveable screens mean that both chapels can open up into the concourse for shared activities such as carol services. A portable organ, with one manual and four stops, was installed in 1983, and can be moved for use in either chapel or the concourse. Each chapel seats about 220 people.

The Anglican/Nonconformist chapel is decorated with a wooden sculpture behind the communion table, entitled &quot;The Battle&quot;. Constructed by local artist, Jan Thorn, it is reminiscent of a crown of thorns. The wall behind the Catholic alter is decorated with a fresco-secco depicting the Transfiguration of Jesus, which was painted over 12 days in 2017 by the Eastern Orthodox iconographer Aidan Hart.

== Usage ==
The centre also includes a Buddhist Meditation Room and a Quiet Room used by Quakers. The centre hosts weekly Mindfulness sessions and serves as a meeting place for the Lancaster Jewish Society every Shabbat. Opposite the Chaplaincy Centre in Ash House are the university&#x27;s Islamic prayer rooms.

The centre is also used as a polling station for local and national elections.

<doc id="317000" wikidata="Q367202" url="?curid=317000" title="City upon a Hill">
<text>&quot;City upon a hill&quot; is a phrase derived from the teaching of salt and light in Jesus&#x27;s Sermon on the Mount. Originally applied to the city of Boston by early 17th century Puritans, it came to adopt broader use in political rhetoric in United States politics, that of a declaration of American exceptionalism, and referring to America acting as a &quot;beacon of hope&quot; for the world.

==Speech by John Winthrop==
This scripture was cited at the end of Puritan John Winthrop&#x27;s lecture or treatise, &quot;A Model of Christian Charity&quot; delivered on March 21, 1630, at Holyrood Church in Southampton, before his first group of Massachusetts Bay colonists embarked on the ship &quot;Arbella&quot; to settle Boston. In quoting Matthew&#x27;s Gospel (5:14) in which Jesus warns, &quot;a city on a hill cannot be hid,&quot; Winthrop warned his fellow Puritans that their new community would be &quot;as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us&quot;, meaning, if the Puritans failed to uphold their covenant with God, then their sins and errors would be exposed for all the world to see: &quot;So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword through the world&quot;.

Winthrop&#x27;s lecture was forgotten for nearly two hundred years until the Massachusetts Historical Society published it in 1839. It remained an obscure reference for more than another century until Cold War era historians and political leaders reinterpreted the event, crediting Winthrop&#x27;s text, erroneously, as the foundational document of the idea of American exceptionalism. More recently, Princeton historian Dan T. Rogers has corrected the record, explaining that there was no grand sense of destiny among the first Puritans to settle Boston. They carried no ambitions to build a New Jerusalem. They did not name their new home Zion, or Canaan, the promised land of milk and honey. They sought only a place to uphold their covenant with God, free from the interference they experienced in England. By the second generation of settlement, New England was a backwater in the Protestant Reformation, an inconsequential afterthought to the Puritan Commonwealth in England and the wealthier Dutch Republic. In truth, America&#x27;s sense of destiny came generations later.

Winthrop&#x27;s warning that &quot;we will become a story&quot; has been fulfilled several times in the four centuries since, as described in &quot;Wayward Puritans: A Study in the Sociology of Deviance&quot; by Kai T. Erikson in 1966.

==Use in American politics==
On 9 January 1961, President-elect John F. Kennedy quoted the phrase during delivered to the general court of Massachusetts:

On 3 November 1980, Ronald Reagan referred to the same event and image in his election-eve address, &quot;A Vision for America&quot;. Reagan was reported to have been inspired by author Manly P. Hall and his book &quot;The Secret Destiny of America&quot;, which alleged a secret order of philosophers had created the idea of America as a country for religious freedom and self-governance.

Reagan would reference this concept through multiple speeches; notably again in his January 11, 1989, farewell speech to the nation:
U.S. Senator Barack Obama also made reference to the topic in his commencement address on 2 June 2006, at the University of Massachusetts Boston:

In 2016, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney incorporated the idiom into a condemnation of Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign:

During the 2016 presidential race, Texas Senator Ted Cruz used the phrase during his speech announcing the suspension of his campaign. President Barack Obama also alluded to President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s use of the phrase, during his speech at the Democratic National Convention the same year, as he proposed a vision of America in contrast to that of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

In 2017, former FBI director James Comey used the phrase in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election:

On November 10, 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo used the phrase while delivering an address at the inauguration of the Ronald Reagan Institute Center for Freedom and Democracy.
Chair Bennie Thompson, of the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, used the phrase in his opening remarks on the first day of hearing on 9 June 2022.

==Use in Australian politics==
In Australian politics, the similar phrase &quot;the light on the hill&quot; was famously used in a 1949 conference speech by Prime Minister Ben Chifley, and as a consequence this phrase is used to describe the objective of the Australian Labor Party. It has often been referenced by both journalists and political leaders in that context since this time.

== Use in Augustine and Roman Catholic politics ==
==Use in hymns==
The phrase is used in the hymn &quot;Now, Saviour now, Thy Love Impart&quot;. written by Charles Wesley.

<doc id="317001" wikidata="Q609037" url="?curid=317001" title="Council of States (Switzerland)">
<text>The Council of States is the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, and the lower house being the National Council. It comprises 46 members.

Twenty of the country&#x27;s cantons are represented by two Councillors each. Six cantons, traditionally called &quot;half cantons&quot;, are represented by one Councillor each for historical reasons. These are Obwalden, Nidwalden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden. The Councillors serve for four years, and are not bound in their vote to instructions from the cantonal authorities.

==Electoral system==

Under the Swiss Federal Constitution, the mode of election to the Council of States is left to the cantons, the provision being that it must be a democratic method. All cantons now provide for the councilors to be chosen by popular election, although historically it was typically the cantons&#x27; legislatures that elected representatives to Bern.

Despite this freedom that the Constitution provides, all cantons except and (which use proportional representation to elect their councilors) elect councilors through an up to two-round system of voting. In the first round of voting, candidates must obtain an absolute majority of the vote in order to be elected. If no candidate receives an absolute majority in the first round of voting then a second round is held in which a simple plurality is sufficient to be elected. The two candidates with the most votes in the second round are elected.

However, eligibility to vote varies according to the applicable cantonal law. Two notable variations are that qualified foreigners may vote in Neuchâtel and Jura, and the minimum voting age is 16 in Glarus.

In all the cantons except the councillors are elected concurrently with the members of the National Council. In the representative is elected by the popular assembly () during the April before the national vote.

==Working languages==
In debates, councilors can choose any of the federal languages, usually the one they are most proficient in: German, French, Italian, or Romansh. German (High German) and French are the most frequently used. While the National Council offers simultaneous interpretation for German and French (since 1960) and Italian (since about 2000), the Council of States offers none. Councilors are expected to understand at least two languages, German and French.

==Voting==
Issues before the council pass with a majority of the votes cast. The president of the council typically does not vote, unless there is a tie. In three cases, votes require a majority in both councils in order to pass: emergency legislation, votes on subsidies, guarantees, or any expenditure of more than 20 million CHF on a non-recurring basis, or 2 million CHF on a recurring basis. In any case where a majority of the council is required, the president of the council will vote.

Until 2014, votes in the chamber were conducted with members raising their hands to be counted. After Politnetz, a Swiss political information platform, recorded a 2012 vote regarding an import ban on reptile skins, it found that the official vote count differed from what was shown in the video. In what was called &quot;Stöckligate&quot;, Politnetz showed that several votes on the matter all resulted in miscounts. (The name Stöckligate refers to a colloquial name for the Council of States. A &quot;Stöckli&quot; is a second home built on a farm for the elder farmer after the property has been deeded to the heirs. The name is applied to the chamber as it is viewed as having older members than the National Council.). As a result of the affair, council member This Jenny introduced a bill to require electronic voting.

Since 1 March 2014, votes in the Council of States have been conducted electronically, with a tally shown on electronic display boards. The rule changes also allowed for disclosure of how members voted. The recorded votes are made public for votes on overall bills, final votes, and votes that require a qualified majority. Names and votes will be published if 10 members request this.

==Membership==

Council members earn a base salary of 26,000 CHF per year plus a 440 CHF per diem for attending sessions of the council or the committees. Members also receive 33,000 CHF per year for staff and material expenses. Members also receive food, travel and hotel allowances and a pension contribution. The Swiss government estimates that a member typically receives 130,000 to 150,000 CHF per year.

==Population per seat==
The Council of States reflects the federal nature of Switzerland: seats are distributed by state (canton), not by population. Most cantons send two representatives, but the historic half-cantons (Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landshaft) each send one. Consequently, the number of people represented by a single seat in the Council of State varies by a factor of 45.8, from 16,000 for the half-canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden to 733,050 for each of the two seats for the canton of Zurich.

<text>The Quiet American is a 1955 novel by English author Graham Greene.

Narrated in the first person by journalist Thomas Fowler, the novel depicts the breakdown of French colonialism in Vietnam and early American involvement in the Vietnam War. A subplot concerns a love triangle between Fowler, an American CIA agent named Alden Pyle, and Phuong, a young Vietnamese woman.

The novel implicitly questions the foundations of growing American involvement in Vietnam in the 1950s, exploring the subject through links among its three main characters: Fowler, Pyle and Phuong. The novel has received much attention due to its prediction of the outcome of the Vietnam War and subsequent American foreign policy since the 1950s. Greene portrays Pyle as so blinded by American exceptionalism that he cannot see the calamities he brings upon the Vietnamese. The book uses Greene&#x27;s experiences as a war correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; and in French Indochina 1951–1954. He was apparently inspired to write &quot;The Quiet American&quot; during October 1951 while driving back to Saigon from Ben Tre province, accompanied by an American aid worker who lectured him about finding a &quot;third force in Vietnam&quot;.

It was twice adapted for film, in 1958 and in 2002.

==Plot==
Thomas Fowler is a British journalist in his fifties who has covered the French war in Vietnam for more than two years. He meets a young American idealist named Alden Pyle, a CIA agent working undercover. Pyle lives his life and forms his opinions based on foreign policy books written by York Harding with no real experience in Southeast Asia matters. Harding&#x27;s theory is that neither communism nor colonialism are proper in foreign lands like Vietnam, but rather a &quot;Third Force&quot;—usually a combination of traditions—works best. When they first meet, the earnest Pyle asks Fowler to help him understand more about the country, but the older man&#x27;s cynical realism does not sink in. Pyle is certain that American power can put the Third Force in charge, but he knows little about Indochina and recasts it into theoretical categories.

Fowler has a live-in lover, Phuong, who is only 20 years old and was previously a dancer at The Arc-en-Ciel (Rainbow) on Jaccareo Road, in Cholon. Her sister&#x27;s intent is to arrange a marriage for Phuong that will benefit herself and her family. The sister disapproves of their relationship because Fowler is already married and an atheist. At a dinner with Fowler and Phuong, Pyle meets her sister, who immediately starts questioning Pyle about his viability for marriage with Phuong.

Fowler goes to Phat Diem to witness a battle. Pyle travels there to tell him that he has been in love with Phuong since the first night he saw her, and that he wants to marry her. They make a toast to nothing and Pyle leaves the next day. Fowler gets a letter from Pyle thanking him for being so nice. The letter annoys Fowler because of Pyle&#x27;s arrogant confidence that Phuong will leave Fowler to marry him. Meanwhile, Fowler&#x27;s editor wants him to return to England.

Pyle visits Fowler&#x27;s residence and they ask Phuong to choose between them. She chooses Fowler, unaware that his transfer is pending. Fowler writes to his wife to ask for a divorce, in front of Phuong.

Fowler and Pyle meet again in a war zone. They end up in a guard tower where they discuss topics ranging from sexual experiences to religion. Their presence endangers the local guards by attracting an attack by the Viet Minh. Pyle saves Fowler&#x27;s life as they escape. Fowler returns to Saigon, where he lies to Phuong that his wife will divorce him. Pyle exposes the lie and Phuong must again choose between him and Fowler. Phuong considers her own interests realistically and without sentiment. She moves in with Pyle. Fowler writes to his editor, who decides that he can stay in Indo-China for another year. Fowler goes into the midst of the battlefield to witness events.

When Fowler returns to Saigon, he goes to Pyle&#x27;s office to confront him, but Pyle is out. Pyle comes over later for drinks and they talk about his pending marriage to Phuong. Later that week, a bicycle bomb is detonated and many innocent civilians are killed. Fowler realizes that Pyle was involved. Pyle had allied himself with General Thé, a renegade commander he was grooming to lead the &quot;Third Force&quot; described in Harding&#x27;s book. Pyle thus brings disaster upon innocents, all the while certain he is bringing a third way to Vietnam. Fowler is emotionally conflicted about this discovery, but ultimately decides to aid in assassinating Pyle. Although the police suspect that Fowler is involved, they cannot prove it. Phuong goes back to Fowler as if nothing had ever happened. In the last chapter, Fowler receives a telegram from his wife in which she states that she has changed her mind and will begin divorce proceedings. The novel ends with Fowler thinking about his first meeting with, and the death of, Pyle.

==Major characters==
Thomas Fowler is a British journalist in his fifties who has been covering the French war in Vietnam for more than two years. He has become a very jaded and cynical man. He meets Alden Pyle and finds him naïve. Throughout the book Fowler is often caught in lies and sometimes there may be speculation that he is lying to himself. Fowler&#x27;s relationship with Vietnamese woman Phuong often intensifies the conflict of the story, especially between Fowler and Pyle.

Alden Pyle is the &quot;quiet American&quot; of the title. A CIA agent working undercover, Pyle is thoughtful, soft-spoken, intellectual, serious, and idealistic. He comes from a privileged East Coast background. His father is a renowned professor of underwater erosion whose picture has appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine; his mother is well respected in their community. Pyle is a brilliant graduate of Harvard University. He has studied theories of government and society, and is particularly devoted to a scholar named York Harding. Harding&#x27;s theory is that neither Communism nor colonialism is the answer in foreign lands like Vietnam, but rather a &quot;Third Force&quot;, usually a combination of traditions, works best. Pyle has read Harding&#x27;s numerous books many times and has adopted Harding&#x27;s thinking as his own. Pyle also strives to be a member of this &quot;Third Force&quot;. US military counter-insurgency expert Edward Lansdale, who was stationed in Vietnam 1953–1957, is sometimes cited as a model for Pyle&#x27;s character. In fact Greene did not meet Lansdale until after completing much of the novel. According to Greene, the inspiration for the character of Pyle was Leo Hochstetter, an American serving as public affairs director for the Economic Aid Mission in Indochina who was assumed by the French to &quot;belong to the CIA&quot;, and lectured him on the &quot;long drive back to Saigon on the necessity of finding a &#x27;third force in Vietnam.&#x27;”

Phuong, Fowler&#x27;s lover at the beginning of the novel, is a beautiful young Vietnamese woman who stays with him for security and protection, and leaves him for the same reason. She is considered by Fowler as a lover to be taken for granted and by Pyle as someone to be protected. Pyle&#x27;s desire for Phuong was largely interpreted by critics to parallel his desire for a non-Americanised South Vietnam. Her character is never fully developed or revealed. She is never able to show her emotions, as her older sister makes decisions for her. She is named after, but not based on, a Vietnamese friend of Greene&#x27;s.

Vigot, a French inspector at the Sûreté, investigates Pyle&#x27;s death. He is a man anguished between doing his duty (pursuing Pyle&#x27;s death and questioning Fowler) and doing what is best for the country (letting the matter be unsolved). He and Fowler are oddly akin in some ways, both faintly cynical and weary of the world; hence their discussion of Blaise Pascal. But they are divided by the differences of their faith: Vigot is a Roman Catholic and Fowler an atheist.

==Literary significance and reception==

The novel was popular in Britain, and over the years achieved notable status. It was adapted to film in 1958, and again in 2002 by Miramax. The 2002 film featured Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, and earned Caine a Best Actor nomination.

When the novel was first published in the United States in 1956, however, it was widely condemned there as anti-American. For example, it was criticised in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for portraying Americans as murderers (largely based on one scene in which a bomb explodes in a crowd of people). According to critic Philip Stratford, &quot;American readers were incensed, perhaps not so much because of the biased portrait of obtuse and destructive American innocence and idealism in Alden Pyle, but because in this case it was drawn with such acid pleasure by a middle-class English snob like Thomas Fowler whom they were all too ready to identify with Greene himself&quot;.

The title of a 1958 book, &quot;The Ugly American&quot;, was a play on Greene&#x27;s title; however, the authors of that book, Eugene Burdick and William Lederer, had arguably thoroughly misunderstood Greene&#x27;s novel, since their book argued that the American diplomatic corps needed to be more modern, technically proficient, and friendly in assisting Third World countries—some of the exact opinions that Greene had depicted as blinding Alden Pyle.

French journalist Jean-Claude Pomonti&#x27;s 2006 book about the South Vietnamese correspondent and Viet Cong spy Phạm Xuân Ẩn was titled &quot;Un Vietnamien bien tranquille&quot; (&quot;The Quiet Vietnamese&quot;), which was widely understood as a play on the title of Greene&#x27;s book.

Scott Anderson&#x27;s 2021 book, &quot;The Quiet Americans: Four CIA Spies at the Dawn of the Cold War—A Tragedy in Three Parts&quot;, describes the activities of CIA operators during the Cold War. This book&#x27;s title too is a play on the title of Greene&#x27;s book, although its spy craft-related themes are different.

On 5 November 2019, the BBC News included &quot;The Quiet American&quot; on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
The novel has been adapted to film twice, in 1958 and 2002. The 1958 Hollywood film inverted the theme of the novel, turning it into an anti-communist story instead of a cautionary tale about American interventionism. The plot of the 2002 film version, in contrast, was true to the book. It was test-screened to positive audience reactions on 10 September 2001. However, the 9-11 attacks took place the next day, and audience ratings declined with each subsequent screening. Reacting to criticism of its &quot;unpatriotic&quot; message, Miramax shelved the film for a year.

<doc id="317004" wikidata="Q46143" url="?curid=317004" title="Common rosefinch">
<text>The common rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus) or scarlet rosefinch is the most widespread and common rosefinch of Asia and Europe.

==Taxonomy==
In a molecular phylogenetic study of the finch family published in 2012, Zuccon and colleagues found that the common rosefinch fell outside the core &quot;Carpodacus&quot; rosefinch clade and was a sister to the scarlet finch (at the time &quot;Haematospiza sipahi&quot;). They recommended that the common rosefinch should be moved to a new monotypic genus with the resurrected name of &quot;Erythrina&quot;. The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union accepted this proposal, but the International Ornithological Union chose instead to adopt a more inclusive &quot;Carpodacus&quot; that retained the common rosefinch in the rosefinch genus.

The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;karpos&quot;, &quot;fruit&quot; and &quot;dakno&quot;, &quot;to bite&quot;, and the specific &quot;erythrinus&quot; is from Latin &quot;erythros&quot;, &quot;red&quot;.

==Description==

The common rosefinch is in length. It has a stout and conical bill. The mature male has brilliant rosy-carmine head, breast and rump; heavy bill; dark brown wings with two indistinct bars, and a white belly. Females and young males are dull-colored with yellowish-brown above, brighter on the rump and greyer on head; buff below.

Adults moult in their winter quarters, between September and November. After moulting the red of male is subdued, and becomes brighter during the winter due to wear of the feathers.

A rare form exists, in which the red colouring of males is replaced by yellow. The cause is environmental, rather than genetic, being affected by diet and the presence of parasites.

== Distribution and habitat ==
It has spread westward through Europe; in recent decades, it has been observed in Portugal, and has occurred in the British Isles as a rare visitor, with some breeding records in recent years. Common rosefinches breed from the Danube valley, Sweden, and Siberia to the Bering Sea; the Caucasus, northern Iran and Afghanistan, the western Himalayas, Tibet and China; to Japan between latitudes 25° and 68°. In winter they are found from southern Iran to south-east China, India, Burma, and Indochina. It occurs as a vagrant in Sri Lanka. 

They are found in summer in thickets, woodland and forest edges near rivers and in winter in gardens and orchards, wetlands and locally in dry oak woods.

== Behaviour ==
The nest is placed low in a bush. The eggs are dark blue with coarse dark brown spots, and a typical clutch contains five eggs.

<text>Dawn Roma French (born 11 October 1957) is a British actress, comedian, and writer. She is known for writing and starring on the BBC sketch comedy series &quot;French and Saunders&quot; (1987–2007) with her best friend and comedy partner Jennifer Saunders, and playing the lead role of Geraldine Granger in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; (1994–2020). French has been nominated for seven British Academy Television Awards and won a BAFTA Fellowship with Saunders in 2009.

==Early life==
French was born on 11 October 1957 in Holyhead, Wales, to English parents Felicity Roma (&quot;née&quot; O&#x27;Brien; 1934 – 2012) and Denys Vernon French (5 August 1932 – 11 September 1977), who married in their home town of Plymouth in 1953. French has an older brother, Gary. Her father served in the Royal Air Force, stationed at RAF Valley and later RAF Leconfield, where Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother went to tea at French&#x27;s home when French was three years old. RAF archive footage of this event was included in French&#x27;s comedy tour/video &quot;Thirty Million Minutes&quot;.

The RAF partly funded French&#x27;s private education. When her father was stationed at RAF Faldingworth, French attended Caistor Grammar School for one year. She later attended boarding school at St Dunstan&#x27;s Abbey School for Girls in Plymouth (since absorbed by Plymouth College), where she was a member of Downton house. After finishing her schooling, she spent a year studying at the Spence School in New York on a debating scholarship that she won while at school.

French has said that her self-confidence and self-belief stem from her father, who told her how beautiful she was each day. She stated, &quot;He taught me to value myself. He told me that I was beautiful and the most precious thing in his life.&quot; Denys had a history of severe depression and made two suicide attempts, but managed to conceal his illness from Dawn and Gary. When French was 19, her father died by suicide.

In 1977, French began studying drama at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, where she met her future comedy partner, Jennifer Saunders. Both came from RAF backgrounds. They had grown up on the same camps, even having had the same best friend, although never meeting. Saunders recalled her first perception of French was that she was a &quot;cocky little upstart&quot;; French considered Saunders to be snooty and aloof. The comic duo originally did not like each other as French wanted to become a drama teacher whereas Saunders loathed the idea and thus disliked French for being enthusiastic and confident about the course.

French and Saunders shared a flat while at college and were influenced to do comedy by their flatmates as part of their projects for college. After talking in depth for the first time, they came to be friends. While at college, French broke up with her fiancé, a former Royal Navy officer. After French and Saunders graduated from the Royal Central School, they decided to form a double-act called the Menopause Sisters. Saunders has described the act, which involved wearing tampons in their ears, as &quot;cringeworthy&quot;. The manager of the club recalled, &quot;They didn&#x27;t seem to give a damn. There was no star quality about them at all.&quot; French and Saunders came to public attention as members of the Comic Strip, part of the alternative comedy scene in the early 1980s.

==Career==
===Television===
====1980s====
French has had an extensive career on television, debuting on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot; series in an episode called &quot;Five Go Mad in Dorset&quot; in 1982. Each episode presented a self-contained story and, in addition to French and Saunders, showcased Comic Strip performers Peter Richardson, Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer, Robbie Coltrane and Adrian Edmondson. She acted in 27 of the 37 episodes and wrote two of them. One episode featured a parody of spaghetti westerns and another a black and white film about a hopelessly goofy boy. Some of French&#x27;s first exposure to a wider audience occurred when comedy producer Martin Lewis recorded a &quot;Comic Strip&quot; record album in 1981 which featured sketches by French &amp; Saunders. The album was released on Springtime!/Island Records in September 1981 and presented French and Jennifer Saunders to an audience outside London. In 1985, French starred with Saunders, Tracey Ullman, Ruby Wax and Joan Greenwood in &quot;Girls on Top&quot;, which portrayed four eccentric women sharing a flat in London.

French has co-written and starred in her and Saunders&#x27; comedy series, &quot;French &amp; Saunders&quot;, which debuted in 1987. On their show, the duo have spoofed many celebrities such as Madonna, Cher, Catherine Zeta-Jones and the Spice Girls. They have also parodied films such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;. After 20 years being on television together, their sketch series &quot;A Bucket o&#x27; French &amp; Saunders&quot;, began airing on 8 September 2007.

====1990s====
French and Saunders have also followed separate careers. During French&#x27;s time starring in &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot;, from 1991 to 1999, she played a different character each week, whether it was the murderer, victim, or both.

French&#x27;s biggest solo television role to date has been as the title figure in the long-running BBC comedy &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;, which Richard Curtis created for her. The show began in 1994. She stars as Geraldine Granger, a vicar of a small fictional village called Dibley. An audience of 12.3 million watched the final full-length episode to see her character&#x27;s marriage ceremony. She appeared on &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; with Damian Lewis in a mini-episode made for Comic Relief in 2013. She was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance in the last episode of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;. Repeats of the show on BBC One still attract millions of viewers and it also retains a following amongst PBS viewers in the United States. Although the main series ended in 2007, the show has returned for numerous short special episodes since, the latest four of which aired in December 2020.

In 1995, she appeared as a talk-show host in a Comic Relief sketch called &quot;Dawn&quot;, written by Victoria Wood. The sketch also featured Wood herself, Celia Imrie, Lill Roughley, Anne Reid, Philip Lowrie, Robert Kingswell, Bryan Burdon, Duncan Preston, Jim Broadbent, and Lynda Bellingham.

====2000s====
In 2002, French appeared in the comedy/drama mini-series &quot;Ted and Alice&quot;. In the series, set in the Lake District, French played a tourist information officer who falls in love with an alien. She appeared once in the Saunders led sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; as TV interviewer Kathy in 1992, a parody of Lorraine Kelly, she reprised that role for &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot; in 2016 as a more established veteran journalist as Kelly is now. She also appeared in the BBC sitcom &quot;Wild West&quot;, with Catherine Tate, in which she played a woman living in Cornwall who is a lesbian, more through lack of choice than any specific natural urge. This series did not meet with as much success as her earlier roles and it ended in 2004 after two years.

French played a major role in &quot;Jam &amp; Jerusalem&quot; as a woman called Rosie who has dissociative identity disorder and with it an alter ego called &quot;Margaret&quot;. She co-starred alongside Sue Johnston, Jennifer Saunders (who also created and wrote the series) and Joanna Lumley. She made a guest appearance in &quot;Little Britain&quot; as Vicky Pollard&#x27;s mother. French also appeared in a special version of &quot;Little Britain Live&quot; which featured several celebrity guests and was shown by the BBC as part of Comic Relief. She played the part of a lesbian barmaid in a sketch with Daffyd Thomas.

In 2006, French appeared in &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; in the 2006 episode &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;. She appeared as Caroline Arless in the BBC television drama &quot;Lark Rise to Candleford&quot; in 2008. Talking about her role, she has stated, &quot;I&#x27;m quite a vibrant character. She&#x27;s quite extreme, in that she drinks too much, laughs too much and sings too much. But she loves her family very much; it&#x27;s just that she goes over the top sometimes.&quot;

====2010s====
In late 2010, French starred in &quot;Roger &amp; Val Have Just Got In&quot; with actor Alfred Molina, which aired for two series.

French appeared in &quot;Little Crackers&quot;, short comedy films which were broadcast over Christmas in 2010.

French appeared as a special guest on Michael Bublé&#x27;s &quot;Home For Christmas&quot; in December 2011. In July 2012, she was a judge in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Superstar&quot; live shows. In March 2013, it was announced that French would replace Brian McFadden on the judging panel of Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; alongside Kyle Sandilands, Geri Halliwell (who replaced Dannii Minogue) and Timomatic who is the additional fourth judge. French departed the show after one series and was replaced by Kelly Osbourne.

From 2016 until 2019, French starred in three series of &quot;Delicious&quot; on Sky 1, co-starring as a talented cook who is having an affair with her celebrity chef ex-husband (Iain Glen) who has remarried and started a successful hotel business with his new wife (Emilia Fox) in Cornwall.

====2020s====
In 2020, she appeared in the six-part series &quot;The Trouble with Maggie Cole&quot; alongside Mark Heap.

In 2021, French appeared as a celebrity guest judge on the second series of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK&quot;, where she judged the final five contestants, Lawrence Chaney, Bimini Bon-Boulash, Tayce, Ellie Diamond and A&#x27;Whora, on their comedy stand-up routines.

===Film===
In 1996, French appeared in &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; as &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Wife&quot; alongside Martin Landau and star Jonathan Taylor Thomas. French played The Fat Lady in the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, replacing Elizabeth Spriggs, who played the character in the first film of the series. French&#x27;s then-husband, Lenny Henry, provided the voice of the Shrunken Head in the same film, though they shared no screen time. In 2005, French provided the voice for the character Mrs. Beaver in Disney and Walden Media&#x27;s film adaptation of C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.&quot; In 2010, French lent her voice to the role of Angie the Elephant in the English dub of the German-British environmental animated film &quot;Animals United&quot;.

===Theatre===
She has also taken roles in the theatre. French has appeared in plays such as &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;My Brilliant Divorce,&quot; and &quot;Smaller,&quot; the latter of which she played a schoolteacher caring for her disabled mother. January 2007 saw French performing as the Duchesse de Crackentorp at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, in &quot;The Daughter of the Regiment&quot; (&quot;La fille du régiment&quot;) by Gaetano Donizetti starring Natalie Dessay and Juan Diego Flórez. French returned to Covent Garden and &quot;La Fille du règiment&quot; in the 2010 revival.

In December 2022, French began appearing in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the London Palladium.

===Stand-up comedy===
In 2014, French toured an autobiographical one woman show &quot;30 Million Minutes&quot; in the UK and Oceania. The title is based on the amount of minutes she had been alive at the time of producing the show.

In 2022, she toured the UK with a further show titled &quot;Dawn French is a Huge Twat&quot;. In late 2022 it was announced that she would continue touring the UK with the same show in Autumn 2023, with further shows taking place in Australia in 2024.

In 2021, French was chosen to play the voice of a fairy lady for the Christmas food advertisements for leading retailer Marks and Spencers alongside Tom Holland voicing the company&#x27;s mascot Percy Pig (who came to life for the first time in 29 years). In the main advert French as the fairy drops her magic wand onto a box covered in Percy pig wrappings, the lid opens and Percy pops out of the box. Throughout the rest of the advertisement she shows Percy all of the items which the retailer was selling for Christmas food.

She later reprised the role for the 2022 M&amp;S Christmas advert, playing alongside Jennifer Saunders voicing a sidekick called &#x27;Duckie&#x27;. The pair, in the main advert, go on a journey to fill Duckie with &#x27;some festive cheer&#x27; while showing off the M&amp;S Food Christmas range for 2022.

===Writing===
French has also written a best-selling epistolary autobiography, which she has titled &quot;Dear Fatty&quot;. French was paid a £1.5 million advance for the book, which was released in 2008. On an appearance on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; on 6 October 2008, French said that &quot;Fatty&quot; is her nickname for Jennifer Saunders, as a joke about her own size. French said that she became great friends with Saunders well before they started working together, which was &quot;over 30 years ago&quot;. The book consists of letters to the different people who have been in her life. In 2017, &quot;Me. You. A Diary&quot;, French&#x27;s second non-fiction book, was released. She has also written four novels – &quot;A Tiny Bit Marvellous&quot; (2010), &quot;Oh Dear Silvia&quot; (2012), &quot;According to Yes&quot; (2015) and &quot;Because of You&quot; (2020). &quot;Because of You&quot; was longlisted for the 2021 Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction. Her third non-fiction book, &quot;The Twat Files&quot;, tied in to her second stand-up show &quot;Dawn French is a Huge Twat&quot;, was published in October 2023.

===Music videos===
In 1986, she appeared in Kate Bush&#x27;s music video &quot;Experiment IV&quot; alongside Hugh Laurie, Richard Vernon and Peter Vaughan.

French has appeared in the videos for Alison Moyet&#x27;s songs &quot;Love Letters&quot; (which also featured Saunders) in 1987 and &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot; in 1994.

She also appeared in two Comic Relief music videos. In 1989 she joined Jennifer Saunders and Kathy Burke to form Lananeeneenoonoo and, along with Bananarama, they created a charity single to raise money for Comic Relief. It was a cover version of The Beatles song &quot;Help!&quot;, and was released on the London Records label, entering the UK Singles Chart on 25 February 1989 and reaching a high of #3. It remained in the chart for nine weeks.

French, Saunders and Burke returned for Comic Relief in 1997 as &quot;The Sugar Lumps,&quot; along with Llewella Gideon and Lulu, to parody The Spice Girls, with whom they performed a version of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;.

==Personal life==
French met comedian Lenny Henry on the alternative comedy circuit. The couple married on 20 October 1984 in Covent Garden, London. They adopted a daughter, Billie. French has stated that Billie has always known that she was adopted, but once took out an injunction when a biographer came close to revealing the identity of Billie&#x27;s biological mother. When faced with a question about how she and Henry would feel if Billie wanted to find out about her birth mother, French commented, &quot;Whatever she wants to do when she&#x27;s 18, we&#x27;ll support her. What I do worry about is anyone else making the decision for her.&quot;

During the 2010 general election campaign, French was cited as a supporter of the Labour Party. She supported Keir Starmer during the 2020 Labour leadership election.

On 6 April 2010, French and Henry announced they were separating after 25 years of marriage. It was reported that the separation was amicable. They had decided to separate in October the previous year but left announcing it until some months later, as they were still in discussion over the separation. Their divorce was finalised later that year.

French began dating charity executive Mark Bignell in 2011. On 22 April 2013, it was reported that they had just married. The couple resided in Fowey, Cornwall, in a mansion overlooking Readymoney Cove. The Grade II-listed building dates back to the 19th century.
In May 2021 it was announced that French had sold her Fowey property, having moved to an 1868 Gothic revival property in Calstock.

In September 2014, French was named as the new Chancellor of Falmouth University.

French is a supporter of Plymouth Argyle.

==Awards and recognition==
French and Saunders won the honorary Golden Rose of Montreux award in 2002 and in 2003, she was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In a 2006 poll consisting of 4,000 people, French was named as the most admired female celebrity amongst women in Britain.

In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

<doc id="317018" wikidata="Q198099" url="?curid=317018" title="Quantization (signal processing)">
<text>Quantization, in mathematics and digital signal processing, is the process of mapping input values from a large set (often a continuous set) to output values in a (countable) smaller set, often with a finite number of elements. Rounding and truncation are typical examples of quantization processes. Quantization is involved to some degree in nearly all digital signal processing, as the process of representing a signal in digital form ordinarily involves rounding. Quantization also forms the core of essentially all lossy compression algorithms.

The difference between an input value and its quantized value (such as round-off error) is referred to as quantization error, noise or distortion. A device or algorithmic function that performs quantization is called a quantizer. An analog-to-digital converter is an example of a quantizer.

==Example==
For example, rounding a real number formula_1 to the nearest integer value forms a very basic type of quantizer – a &quot;uniform&quot; one. A typical (&quot;mid-tread&quot;) uniform quantizer with a quantization &quot;step size&quot; equal to some value formula_2 can be expressed as

:formula_3,

where the notation formula_4 denotes the floor function.

Alternatively, the same quantizer may be expressed in terms of the ceiling function, as 
:formula_5.

(The notation formula_6 denotes the ceiling function).

The essential property of a quantizer is having a countable set of possible output values smaller than the set of possible input values. The members of the set of output values may have integer, rational, or real values. For simple rounding to the nearest integer, the step size formula_2 is equal to 1. With formula_8 or with formula_2 equal to any other integer value, this quantizer has real-valued inputs and integer-valued outputs.

When the quantization step size (Δ) is small relative to the variation in the signal being quantized, it is relatively simple to show that the mean squared error produced by such a rounding operation will be approximately formula_10. Mean squared error is also called the quantization &quot;noise power&quot;. Adding one bit to the quantizer halves the value of Δ, which reduces the noise power by the factor . In terms of decibels, the noise power change is formula_11

Because the set of possible output values of a quantizer is countable, any quantizer can be decomposed into two distinct stages, which can be referred to as the &quot;classification&quot; stage (or &quot;forward quantization&quot; stage) and the &quot;reconstruction&quot; stage (or &quot;inverse quantization&quot; stage), where the classification stage maps the input value to an integer &quot;quantization index&quot; formula_12 and the reconstruction stage maps the index formula_12 to the &quot;reconstruction value&quot; formula_14 that is the output approximation of the input value. For the example uniform quantizer described above, the forward quantization stage can be expressed as
:formula_15,
and the reconstruction stage for this example quantizer is simply 
:formula_16.

This decomposition is useful for the design and analysis of quantization behavior, and it illustrates how the quantized data can be communicated over a communication channel – a &quot;source encoder&quot; can perform the forward quantization stage and send the index information through a communication channel, and a &quot;decoder&quot; can perform the reconstruction stage to produce the output approximation of the original input data. In general, the forward quantization stage may use any function that maps the input data to the integer space of the quantization index data, and the inverse quantization stage can conceptually (or literally) be a table look-up operation to map each quantization index to a corresponding reconstruction value. This two-stage decomposition applies equally well to vector as well as scalar quantizers.

==Mathematical properties==
Because quantization is a many-to-few mapping, it is an inherently non-linear and irreversible process (i.e., because the same output value is shared by multiple input values, it is impossible, in general, to recover the exact input value when given only the output value).

The set of possible input values may be infinitely large, and may possibly be continuous and therefore uncountable (such as the set of all real numbers, or all real numbers within some limited range). The set of possible output values may be finite or countably infinite. The input and output sets involved in quantization can be defined in a rather general way. For example, vector quantization is the application of quantization to multi-dimensional (vector-valued) input data.

==Types==

===Analog-to-digital converter===
An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be modeled as two processes: sampling and quantization. Sampling converts a time-varying voltage signal into a discrete-time signal, a sequence of real numbers. Quantization replaces each real number with an approximation from a finite set of discrete values. Most commonly, these discrete values are represented as fixed-point words. Though any number of quantization levels is possible, common word lengths are 8-bit (256 levels), 16-bit (65,536 levels) and 24-bit (16.8 million levels). Quantizing a sequence of numbers produces a sequence of quantization errors which is sometimes modeled as an additive random signal called quantization noise because of its stochastic behavior. The more levels a quantizer uses, the lower is its quantization noise power.

===Rate–distortion optimization===
&quot;Rate–distortion optimized&quot; quantization is encountered in source coding for lossy data compression algorithms, where the purpose is to manage distortion within the limits of the bit rate supported by a communication channel or storage medium. The analysis of quantization in this context involves studying the amount of data (typically measured in digits or bits or bit &quot;rate&quot;) that is used to represent the output of the quantizer and studying the loss of precision that is introduced by the quantization process (which is referred to as the &quot;distortion&quot;).

===Mid-riser and mid-tread uniform quantizers===
Most uniform quantizers for signed input data can be classified as being of one of two types: &quot;mid-riser&quot; and &quot;mid-tread&quot;. The terminology is based on what happens in the region around the value 0, and uses the analogy of viewing the input-output function of the quantizer as a stairway. Mid-tread quantizers have a zero-valued reconstruction level (corresponding to a &quot;tread&quot; of a stairway), while mid-riser quantizers have a zero-valued classification threshold (corresponding to a &quot;riser&quot; of a stairway).

Mid-tread quantization involves rounding. The formulas for mid-tread uniform quantization are provided in the previous section.

:formula_3,

Mid-riser quantization involves truncation. The input-output formula for a mid-riser uniform quantizer is given by:
:formula_18,
where the classification rule is given by
:formula_19
and the reconstruction rule is
:formula_20.

Note that mid-riser uniform quantizers do not have a zero output value – their minimum output magnitude is half the step size. In contrast, mid-tread quantizers do have a zero output level. For some applications, having a zero output signal representation may be a necessity.

In general, a mid-riser or mid-tread quantizer may not actually be a &quot;uniform&quot; quantizer – i.e., the size of the quantizer&#x27;s classification intervals may not all be the same, or the spacing between its possible output values may not all be the same. The distinguishing characteristic of a mid-riser quantizer is that it has a classification threshold value that is exactly zero, and the distinguishing characteristic of a mid-tread quantizer is that is it has a reconstruction value that is exactly zero.

===Dead-zone quantizers===
A dead-zone quantizer is a type of mid-tread quantizer with symmetric behavior around 0. The region around the zero output value of such a quantizer is referred to as the &quot;dead zone&quot; or &quot;deadband&quot;. The dead zone can sometimes serve the same purpose as a noise gate or squelch function. Especially for compression applications, the dead-zone may be given a different width than that for the other steps. For an otherwise-uniform quantizer, the dead-zone width can be set to any value formula_21 by using the forward quantization rule
:formula_22,
where the function is the sign function (also known as the &quot;signum&quot; function). The general reconstruction rule for such a dead-zone quantizer is given by
:formula_23,
where formula_24 is a reconstruction offset value in the range of 0 to 1 as a fraction of the step size. Ordinarily, formula_25 when quantizing input data with a typical probability density function (PDF) that is symmetric around zero and reaches its peak value at zero (such as a Gaussian, Laplacian, or generalized Gaussian PDF). Although formula_24 may depend on formula_12 in general and can be chosen to fulfill the optimality condition described below, it is often simply set to a constant, such as formula_28. (Note that in this definition, formula_29 due to the definition of the function, so formula_30 has no effect.)

A very commonly used special case (e.g., the scheme typically used in financial accounting and elementary mathematics) is to set formula_31 and formula_32 for all formula_12. In this case, the dead-zone quantizer is also a uniform quantizer, since the central dead-zone of this quantizer has the same width as all of its other steps, and all of its reconstruction values are equally spaced as well.

==Noise and error characteristics==

===Additive noise model===
A common assumption for the analysis of quantization error is that it affects a signal processing system in a similar manner to that of additive white noise – having negligible correlation with the signal and an approximately flat power spectral density. The additive noise model is commonly used for the analysis of quantization error effects in digital filtering systems, and it can be very useful in such analysis. It has been shown to be a valid model in cases of high-resolution quantization (small formula_2 relative to the signal strength) with smooth PDFs.

Additive noise behavior is not always a valid assumption. Quantization error (for quantizers defined as described here) is deterministically related to the signal and not entirely independent of it. Thus, periodic signals can create periodic quantization noise. And in some cases, it can even cause limit cycles to appear in digital signal processing systems. One way to ensure effective independence of the quantization error from the source signal is to perform &quot;dithered quantization&quot; (sometimes with &quot;noise shaping&quot;), which involves adding random (or pseudo-random) noise to the signal prior to quantization.

===Quantization error models===
In the typical case, the original signal is much larger than one least significant bit (LSB). When this is the case, the quantization error is not significantly correlated with the signal and has an approximately uniform distribution. When rounding is used to quantize, the quantization error has a mean of zero and the root mean square (RMS) value is the standard deviation of this distribution, given by formula_35. When truncation is used, the error has a non-zero mean of formula_36 and the RMS value is formula_37. Although rounding yields less RMS error than truncation, the difference is only due to the static (DC) term of formula_36. The RMS values of the AC error are exactly the same in both cases, so there is no special advantage of rounding over truncation in situations where the DC term of the error can be ignored (such as in AC-coupled systems). In either case, the standard deviation, as a percentage of the full signal range, changes by a factor of 2 for each 1-bit change in the number of quantization bits. The potential signal-to-quantization-noise power ratio therefore changes by 4, or formula_39, approximately 6 dB per bit.

At lower amplitudes the quantization error becomes dependent on the input signal, resulting in distortion. This distortion is created after the anti-aliasing filter, and if these distortions are above 1/2 the sample rate they will alias back into the band of interest. In order to make the quantization error independent of the input signal, the signal is dithered by adding noise to the signal. This slightly reduces signal-to-noise ratio, but can completely eliminate the distortion.

===Quantization noise model===
Quantization noise is a model of quantization error introduced by quantization in the ADC. It is a rounding error between the analog input voltage to the ADC and the output digitized value. The noise is non-linear and signal-dependent. It can be modeled in several different ways.

In an ideal ADC, where the quantization error is uniformly distributed between −1/2 LSB and +1/2 LSB, and the signal has a uniform distribution covering all quantization levels, the Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) can be calculated from

:formula_40

where Q is the number of quantization bits.

The most common test signals that fulfill this are full amplitude triangle waves and sawtooth waves.

For example, a 16-bit ADC has a maximum signal-to-quantization-noise ratio of 6.02 × 16 = 96.3 dB.

When the input signal is a full-amplitude sine wave the distribution of the signal is no longer uniform, and the corresponding equation is instead

:formula_41

Here, the quantization noise is once again &quot;assumed&quot; to be uniformly distributed. When the input signal has a high amplitude and a wide frequency spectrum this is the case. In this case a 16-bit ADC has a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 98.09 dB. The 1.761 difference in signal-to-noise only occurs due to the signal being a full-scale sine wave instead of a triangle or sawtooth.

For complex signals in high-resolution ADCs this is an accurate model. For low-resolution ADCs, low-level signals in high-resolution ADCs, and for simple waveforms the quantization noise is not uniformly distributed, making this model inaccurate. In these cases the quantization noise distribution is strongly affected by the exact amplitude of the signal.

The calculations are relative to full-scale input. For smaller signals, the relative quantization distortion can be very large. To circumvent this issue, analog companding can be used, but this can introduce distortion.

==Design==
===Granular distortion and overload distortion===
Often the design of a quantizer involves supporting only a limited range of possible output values and performing clipping to limit the output to this range whenever the input exceeds the supported range. The error introduced by this clipping is referred to as &quot;overload&quot; distortion. Within the extreme limits of the supported range, the amount of spacing between the selectable output values of a quantizer is referred to as its &quot;granularity&quot;, and the error introduced by this spacing is referred to as &quot;granular&quot; distortion. It is common for the design of a quantizer to involve determining the proper balance between granular distortion and overload distortion. For a given supported number of possible output values, reducing the average granular distortion may involve increasing the average overload distortion, and vice versa. A technique for controlling the amplitude of the signal (or, equivalently, the quantization step size formula_2) to achieve the appropriate balance is the use of &quot;automatic gain control&quot; (AGC). However, in some quantizer designs, the concepts of granular error and overload error may not apply (e.g., for a quantizer with a limited range of input data or with a countably infinite set of selectable output values).

===Rate–distortion quantizer design===
A scalar quantizer, which performs a quantization operation, can ordinarily be decomposed into two stages:
;Classification
:A process that classifies the input signal range into formula_43 non-overlapping &quot;intervals&quot; formula_44, by defining formula_45 &quot;decision boundary&quot; values formula_46, such that formula_47 for formula_48, with the extreme limits defined by formula_49 and formula_50. All the inputs formula_1 that fall in a given interval range formula_52 are associated with the same quantization index formula_12.
;Reconstruction
:Each interval formula_54 is represented by a &quot;reconstruction value&quot; formula_55 which implements the mapping formula_56.

These two stages together comprise the mathematical operation of formula_57.

Entropy coding techniques can be applied to communicate the quantization indices from a source encoder that performs the classification stage to a decoder that performs the reconstruction stage. One way to do this is to associate each quantization index formula_12 with a binary codeword formula_59. An important consideration is the number of bits used for each codeword, denoted here by formula_60. As a result, the design of an formula_43-level quantizer and an associated set of codewords for communicating its index values requires finding the values of formula_46, formula_63 and formula_64 which optimally satisfy a selected set of design constraints such as the &quot;bit rate&quot; formula_65 and &quot;distortion&quot; formula_66.

Assuming that an information source formula_67 produces random variables formula_68 with an associated PDF formula_69, the probability formula_70 that the random variable falls within a particular quantization interval formula_52 is given by:
:formula_72.

The resulting bit rate formula_65, in units of average bits per quantized value, for this quantizer can be derived as follows:
:formula_74.

If it is assumed that distortion is measured by mean squared error, the distortion D, is given by:
:formula_75.

A key observation is that rate formula_65 depends on the decision boundaries formula_77 and the codeword lengths formula_78, whereas the distortion formula_66 depends on the decision boundaries formula_77 and the reconstruction levels formula_81.

After defining these two performance metrics for the quantizer, a typical rate–distortion formulation for a quantizer design problem can be expressed in one of two ways:
# Given a maximum distortion constraint formula_82, minimize the bit rate formula_65
# Given a maximum bit rate constraint formula_84, minimize the distortion formula_66

Often the solution to these problems can be equivalently (or approximately) expressed and solved by converting the formulation to the unconstrained problem formula_86 where the Lagrange multiplier formula_87 is a non-negative constant that establishes the appropriate balance between rate and distortion. Solving the unconstrained problem is equivalent to finding a point on the convex hull of the family of solutions to an equivalent constrained formulation of the problem. However, finding a solution – especially a closed-form solution – to any of these three problem formulations can be difficult. Solutions that do not require multi-dimensional iterative optimization techniques have been published for only three PDFs: the uniform, exponential, and Laplacian distributions. Iterative optimization approaches can be used to find solutions in other cases.

Note that the reconstruction values formula_81 affect only the distortion – they do not affect the bit rate – and that each individual formula_14 makes a separate contribution formula_90 to the total distortion as shown below:
:formula_91
where
:formula_92
This observation can be used to ease the analysis – given the set of formula_77 values, the value of each formula_14 can be optimized separately to minimize its contribution to the distortion formula_66.

For the mean-square error distortion criterion, it can be easily shown that the optimal set of reconstruction values formula_96 is given by setting the reconstruction value formula_14 within each interval formula_52 to the conditional expected value (also referred to as the &quot;centroid&quot;) within the interval, as given by:
:formula_99.

The use of sufficiently well-designed entropy coding techniques can result in the use of a bit rate that is close to the true information content of the indices formula_100, such that effectively
:formula_101
and therefore
:formula_102.

The use of this approximation can allow the entropy coding design problem to be separated from the design of the quantizer itself. Modern entropy coding techniques such as arithmetic coding can achieve bit rates that are very close to the true entropy of a source, given a set of known (or adaptively estimated) probabilities formula_103.

In some designs, rather than optimizing for a particular number of classification regions formula_43, the quantizer design problem may include optimization of the value of formula_43 as well. For some probabilistic source models, the best performance may be achieved when formula_43 approaches infinity.

===Neglecting the entropy constraint: Lloyd–Max quantization===
In the above formulation, if the bit rate constraint is neglected by setting formula_87 equal to 0, or equivalently if it is assumed that a fixed-length code (FLC) will be used to represent the quantized data instead of a variable-length code (or some other entropy coding technology such as arithmetic coding that is better than an FLC in the rate–distortion sense), the optimization problem reduces to minimization of distortion formula_66 alone.

The indices produced by an formula_43-level quantizer can be coded using a fixed-length code using formula_110 bits/symbol. For example, when formula_111256 levels, the FLC bit rate formula_65 is 8 bits/symbol. For this reason, such a quantizer has sometimes been called an 8-bit quantizer. However using an FLC eliminates the compression improvement that can be obtained by use of better entropy coding.

Assuming an FLC with formula_43 levels, the rate–distortion minimization problem can be reduced to distortion minimization alone. The reduced problem can be stated as follows: given a source formula_68 with PDF formula_69 and the constraint that the quantizer must use only formula_43 classification regions, find the decision boundaries formula_117 and reconstruction levels formula_118 to minimize the resulting distortion 
:formula_119.

Finding an optimal solution to the above problem results in a quantizer sometimes called a MMSQE (minimum mean-square quantization error) solution, and the resulting PDF-optimized (non-uniform) quantizer is referred to as a &quot;Lloyd–Max&quot; quantizer, named after two people who independently developed iterative methods to solve the two sets of simultaneous equations resulting from formula_120 and formula_121, as follows:
:formula_122,
which places each threshold at the midpoint between each pair of reconstruction values, and
:formula_123
which places each reconstruction value at the centroid (conditional expected value) of its associated classification interval.

Lloyd&#x27;s Method I algorithm, originally described in 1957, can be generalized in a straightforward way for application to vector data. This generalization results in the Linde–Buzo–Gray (LBG) or k-means classifier optimization methods. Moreover, the technique can be further generalized in a straightforward way to also include an entropy constraint for vector data.

===Uniform quantization and the 6 dB/bit approximation===
The Lloyd–Max quantizer is actually a uniform quantizer when the input PDF is uniformly distributed over the range formula_124. However, for a source that does not have a uniform distribution, the minimum-distortion quantizer may not be a uniform quantizer. The analysis of a uniform quantizer applied to a uniformly distributed source can be summarized in what follows:

A symmetric source X can be modelled with formula_125, for formula_126 and 0 elsewhere.
The step size formula_127 and the &quot;signal to quantization noise ratio&quot; (SQNR) of the quantizer is
:formula_128.

For a fixed-length code using formula_129 bits, formula_130, resulting in
formula_131,

or approximately 6 dB per bit. For example, for formula_129=8 bits, formula_43=256 levels and SQNR = 8×6 = 48 dB; and for formula_129=16 bits, formula_43=65536 and SQNR = 16×6 = 96 dB. The property of 6 dB improvement in SQNR for each extra bit used in quantization is a well-known figure of merit. However, it must be used with care: this derivation is only for a uniform quantizer applied to a uniform source. For other source PDFs and other quantizer designs, the SQNR may be somewhat different from that predicted by 6 dB/bit, depending on the type of PDF, the type of source, the type of quantizer, and the bit rate range of operation.

However, it is common to assume that for many sources, the slope of a quantizer SQNR function can be approximated as 6 dB/bit when operating at a sufficiently high bit rate. At asymptotically high bit rates, cutting the step size in half increases the bit rate by approximately 1 bit per sample (because 1 bit is needed to indicate whether the value is in the left or right half of the prior double-sized interval) and reduces the mean squared error by a factor of 4 (i.e., 6 dB) based on the formula_136 approximation.

At asymptotically high bit rates, the 6 dB/bit approximation is supported for many source PDFs by rigorous theoretical analysis. Moreover, the structure of the optimal scalar quantizer (in the rate–distortion sense) approaches that of a uniform quantizer under these conditions.
==In other fields==

Many physical quantities are actually quantized by physical entities. Examples of fields where this limitation applies include electronics (due to electrons), optics (due to photons), biology (due to DNA), physics (due to Planck limits) and chemistry (due to molecules).

<doc id="317022" wikidata="Q219912" url="?curid=317022" title="Fausto Coppi">
<text>Angelo Fausto Coppi (; 15 September 1919 – 2 January 1960) was an Italian cyclist, the dominant international cyclist of the years after the Second World War. His successes earned him the title &quot;Il Campionissimo&quot; (&quot;Champion of Champions&quot;). He was an all-round racing cyclist: he excelled in both climbing and time trialing, and was also a good sprinter. He won the Giro d&#x27;Italia five times (1940, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953), the Tour de France twice (1949 and 1952), and the World Championship in 1953. Other notable results include winning the Giro di Lombardia five times, the Milan–San Remo three times, as well as wins at Paris–Roubaix and La Flèche Wallonne and setting the hour record (45.798 km) in 1942.

==Early life and amateur career==
Coppi was born in Castellania (now known as Castellania Coppi), near Alessandria, one of five children born to Domenico Coppi and Angiolina Boveri, who married on 29 July 1914. Fausto was the fourth child, born at 5:00 pm on 15 September 1919. His mother wanted to call him Angelo, but his father preferred Fausto. He was named Angelo Fausto but was known most of his life as Fausto.

Coppi had poor health as a child and showed little interest in school. In 1927 he wrote &quot;I ought to be at school, not riding my bicycle&quot; after skipping lessons to spend the day riding a family bike which he had found in a cellar, rusty and without brake blocks. He left school at age 13 to work for Domenico Merlani, a butcher in Novi Ligure more widely known as Signor Ettore.

Cycling to and from the shop and meeting cyclists who came there interested him in racing. The money to buy a bike came from his uncle, also called Fausto Coppi, and his father. Coppi said:

&quot;... [My uncle] was a merchant navy officer on a petrol tanker, and a real cycling fan. He was touched when he heard of my passion for the bike and decided that I deserved a real tool for the job on which I had set my heart, instead of the rusty old crock I was pushing around. I just cried with joy when my kind uncle gave me the 600 lire that were to make my dream come true. I knew from advertisements I had seen in the local papers that for 600 lire I could get a frame built to my measurements in Genoa. Out of my slender savings I took enough for the train fare to Genoa and back, gave my measurements, and handed over the 600 lire. I would have to buy the fittings and tyres from my errand-boy salary. Oh how my legs used to ache at night through climbing all those stairs during the day! But I&#x27;m glad I did, because it surely made my legs so strong&quot;.

&quot;Come back within a week; your frame will be ready&quot; said the owner of the cycle shop&quot;. &quot;But it wasn&#x27;t ready, and not the next week, and not the next. For eight weeks I threw precious money away taking the train to Genoa and still no made-to-measure bike for me. The fellow just couldn&#x27;t be bothered making a frame for a skinny country kid who didn&#x27;t look as if he could pedal a fairy-cycle, let alone a racing bike. I used to cry bitterly as I went back home without the frame. On the ninth journey I took a frame home. But it wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;made to measure&#x27;. The chap just took one down off the rack. I was furious inside, but too shy to do anything about it&quot;.

Coppi rode his first race at age 15, among other boys not attached to cycling clubs, and won first prize: 20 lire and a salami sandwich. Coppi took a racing licence at the start of 1938 and won his first race, at Castelleto d&#x27;Orba, near the butcher&#x27;s shop. He won alone, winning an alarm clock. A regular caller at the butcher&#x27;s shop in Novi Ligure was a former boxer who had become a masseur, a job he could do after losing his sight, in 1938. Giuseppe Cavanna was known to friends as Biagio. Coppi met him that year, recommended by another of Cavanna&#x27;s riders. Cavanna suggested in 1939 that Coppi should become an independent, a class of semi-professionals who could ride against both amateurs and professionals. He sent Coppi to the Tour of Tuscany that April with the advice: &quot;Follow Gino Bartali!&quot; He was forced to stop with a broken wheel. But at Varzi on 7 May 1939 he won one of the races counting to the season-long national independent championship. He finished seven minutes clear of the field and won his next race by six minutes.

==Professional career==
His first major success was in 1940, winning the Giro d&#x27;Italia at the age of 20. On 7 November 1942 he set a world hour record (45.798 km at the Velodromo Vigorelli in Milan). He rode a gear and pedalled with an average cadence of 103.3 rpm. The bike is on display in the chapel of Madonna del Ghisallo near Como, Italy. Coppi beat Maurice Archambaud&#x27;s 45.767 km, set five years earlier on the same track. The record stood until it was beaten by Jacques Anquetil in 1956. His career was then interrupted by active service in the Second World War. In 1946 he resumed racing and achieved remarkable successes which would be exceeded only by Eddy Merckx. The veteran writer Pierre Chany said that from 1946 to 1954 Coppi was never once recaught once he had broken away from the rest.

Twice, 1949 and 1952, Coppi won the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France in the same year, the first to do so. He won the Giro five times, a record shared with Alfredo Binda and Eddy Merckx. During the 1949 Giro he left Gino Bartali by 11 minutes between Cuneo and Pinerolo. Coppi won the 1949 Tour de France by almost half an hour over everyone except Bartali. From the start of the mountains in the Pyrenees to their end in the Alps, Coppi took back the 55 minutes by which Jacques Marinelli led him.

Coppi won the Giro di Lombardia a record five times (1946, 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1954). He won Milan–San Remo three times (1946, 1948 and 1949). In the 1946 Milan–San Remo he attacked with nine others, five kilometres into a race of 292 km. He dropped the rest on the Turchino climb and won by 14 minutes. He also won Paris–Roubaix and La Flèche Wallonne (1950). He was also 1953 world road champion.

In the first years of his career, Coppi was unable to ride the Tour de France. When he turned professional in 1940, the Tour de France was not held because of the Second World War. The Tour restarted in 1947, but Italians were not welcome yet. In 1948, Italians were welcome, but Coppi was suspended by the Italian cycling union because he had abandoned the 1948 Giro d&#x27;Italia in protest against the small penalty given to Fiorenzo Magni. In 1949, Coppi was finally able to enter the Tour. After several stages, Coppi was more than half an hour behind in the general classification, but he gained time in the mountain stages, and ended the Tour winning the general classification and the mountains classification, both with his teammate Bartali in second place, also winning the team classification.

In 1950, Coppi did not defend his Tour title, because he refused to ride together with Bartali. In 1951, he joined (riding together with Bartali), but was still affected by the death of his brother Serse Coppi, and did not excel.
In 1952, Coppi started again in the Tour. He won on the Alpe d&#x27;Huez, which had been included for the first time that year. He attacked six kilometres from the summit to rid himself of the French rider, Jean Robic. Coppi said: &quot;I knew he was no longer there when I couldn&#x27;t hear his breathing any more or the sound of his tyres on the road behind me&quot;. He rode like &quot;a Martian on a bicycle&quot;, said Raphaël Géminiani. &quot;He asked my advice about the gears to use, I was in the French team and he in the Italian, but he was a friend and normally my captain in our everyday team, so I could hardly refuse him. I saw a phenomenal rider that day&quot;. Coppi won the Tour by 28m 27s and the organiser, Jacques Goddet, had to double the prizes for lower placings to keep other riders interested. It was his last Tour, having ridden three and won two. To conserve energy, he would have soigneurs carry him around his hotel during Grand Tours.

Bill McGann wrote:
Comparing riders from different eras is a risky business subject to the prejudices of the judge. But if Coppi isn&#x27;t the greatest rider of all time, then he is second only to Eddy Merckx. One can&#x27;t judge his accomplishments by his list of wins because World War II interrupted his career just as World War I interrupted that of Philippe Thys. Coppi won it all: the world hour record, the world championships, the &quot;grands tours&quot;, classics as well as time trials. The great French cycling journalist, Pierre Chany says that between 1946 and 1954, once Coppi had broken away from the peloton, the peloton never saw him again. Can this be said of any other racer? Informed observers who saw both ride agree that Coppi was the more elegant rider who won by dint of his physical gifts as opposed to Merckx who drove himself and hammered his competition relentlessly by being the very embodiment of pure will.

In 1955 Coppi and his lover Giulia Occhini were put on trial for adultery, then illegal in Italy, and got suspended sentences. The scandal rocked conservative ultra-Catholic Italy and Coppi was disgraced. Coppi&#x27;s career declined after the scandal. He had already been hit in 1951 by the death of his younger brother, Serse Coppi, who crashed in a sprint in the Giro del Piemonte and died of a cerebral haemorrhage. Coppi could never match his old successes. Pierre Chany said he was first to be dropped each day in the Vuelta a España in 1959. Criterium organisers frequently cut their races to 45 km to be certain that Coppi could finish, he said. &quot;Physically, he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to ride even 10km further. He charged himself [took drugs] before every race&quot;. Coppi, said Chany, was &quot;a magnificent and grotesque washout of a man, ironical towards himself; nothing except the warmth of simple friendship could penetrate his melancholia. But I&#x27;m talking of the end of his career. The last year! In 1959! I&#x27;m not talking about the great era. In 1959, he wasn&#x27;t a racing cyclist any more. He was just clinging on [&quot;il tentait de sauver les meubles&quot;].&quot;

Jacques Goddet wrote in an appreciation of Coppi&#x27;s career in &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;: &quot;We would like to have cried out to him &quot;&#x27;Stop&quot;!&#x27; And as nobody dared to, destiny took care of it.&quot;

Raphaël Géminiani said of Coppi&#x27;s domination:
When Fausto won and you wanted to check the time gap to the man in second place, you didn&#x27;t need a Swiss stopwatch. The bell of the church clock tower would do the job just as well. Paris–Roubaix? Milan–San Remo? Lombardy? We&#x27;re talking 10 minutes to a quarter of an hour. That&#x27;s how Fausto Coppi was.

==Rivalry with Bartali==

Coppi&#x27;s racing days are generally referred to as the beginning of the golden years of cycle racing. A factor is the competition between Coppi and Gino Bartali. Italian &quot;tifosi&quot; (fans) divided into &quot;coppiani&quot; and &quot;bartaliani&quot;. Bartali&#x27;s rivalry with Coppi divided Italy. Bartali, conservative, religious, was venerated in the rural, agrarian south, while Coppi, more worldly, secular, innovative in diet and training, was hero of the industrial north. The writer Curzio Malaparte said:

&quot;Bartali belongs to those who believe in tradition ... he is a metaphysical man protected by the saints. Coppi has nobody in heaven to take care of him. His manager, his masseur, have no wings. He is alone, alone on a bicycle ... Bartali prays while he is pedalling: the rational Cartesian and sceptical Coppi is filled with doubts, believes only in his body, his motor&quot;.

Their lives came together on 7 January 1940 when Eberardo Pavesi, head of the Legnano team, took on Coppi to ride in support of Bartali. Their rivalry started when Coppi, the helping hand, won the Giro and Bartali, the star, marshalled the team to chase. By the 1948 world championship at Valkenburg, Limburg in the Netherlands, both climbed off rather than help the other. The Italian cycling association said: &quot;They have forgotten to honour the Italian prestige they represent. Thinking only of their personal rivalry, they abandoned the race, to the approbation of all sportsmen&quot;. They were suspended for three months.

The thaw partly broke when the pair shared a bottle on the Col d&#x27;Izoard in the 1952 Tour but the two fell out over who had offered it. &quot;I did&quot;, Bartali insisted. &quot;He never gave me anything&quot;. Their rivalry was the subject of intense coverage and resulted in epic races.

==Life during World War II==
Coppi joined the Italian Army when Italy entered World War II: the declaration of war on the Allied Powers was made on the day after the finish of the 1940 Giro d&#x27;Italia. Officers initially supported him continuing his riding career: track cycling and one-day racing continued during the war, and Coppi continued to enjoy success, winning the Giro di Toscana, the Giro dell&#x27;Emilia and Tre Valli Varesine on the road in 1941, along with the Italian national pursuit title on the track. He struggled at the beginning of the following year following the death of his father, but became national road champion after suffering a puncture and losing one and a half minutes to the bunch, forcing him into a solo chase to rejoin the peloton. The following week he broke his collarbone in a crash before he was due to defend his national pursuit championship in the final against Cino Cinelli: however, Cinelli refused to accept the title by default, and the final was delayed to October, which Coppi won. Shortly afterwards he made his successful bid for the hour record at Vigorelli Velodrome: the roof of the building still had large holes after Milan had been heavily bombed a few weeks earlier.

However, in March 1943 Coppi was sent to North Africa to participate in the Tunisian campaign, fighting against British forces. According to Coppi&#x27;s identification paper, he was captured on 13 May 1943 in Enfidha, 100 km south of Tunis, although he may have been caught the previous month by the British Eighth Army which was in and around the city at that time. He was kept in the nearby prisoner of war camp at Ksar Saïd. In the camp he met other cyclists, including Silvio Pedroni, who had previously given Coppi a tyre after the latter had suffered a puncture in a race in 1939, and Ilio Simoni, who would later become a team-mate of Coppi&#x27;s at Bianchi. He also shared plates with the father of Claudio Chiappucci, who rode the Tour in the 1990s. He was given odd jobs to do. The British cyclist Len Levesley said he was astonished to find Coppi giving him a haircut.
Levesley, who was on a stretcher with polio, said:
&quot;I should think it took me all of a full second to realise who it was. He looked fine, he looked slim, and having been in the desert, he looked tanned. I&#x27;d only seen him in cycling magazines but I knew instantly who he was. So he cut away at my hair and I tried to have a conversation with him, but he didn&#x27;t speak English and I don&#x27;t speak Italian. But we managed one or two words and I got over to him that I did some club racing. And I gave him a bar of chocolate that I had with me and he was grateful for that and that was the end of it&quot;.

In April 1944, Coppi fell ill with malaria, however this was quickly diagnosed and treated. In November of that year he returned to Italy, arriving at a POW camp in Naples to work as a driver for the Royal Air Force. The British moved Coppi to an RAF base at Caserta in Italy, based in the city&#x27;s royal palace, in 1945. There he worked as a truck driver and as a personal assistant and handyman for an officer, Lieutenant Ronald Smith Towell, who had never heard of him. Despite this, the two struck up a mutually beneficial relationship: Coppi&#x27;s popularity in Italy was helpful to Towell in achieving his goals as an administrator, whilst Towell was able, via S.S.C. Napoli footballer Umberto Busani, to help Coppi make contact with local sports journalist Gino Palumbo, who would later become editor of &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;. Coppi wrote to Palumbo asking if he could assist with obtaining a racing bicycle for him as he only had an army bicycle with heavy tyres which was causing him pain. Palumbo wrote a newspaper article appealing for help: Coppi then received a Legnano racing bike from a Somma Vesuviana carpenter.

The war being as good as over, Coppi was released in 1945. In addition he had distanced himself from Mussolini&#x27;s government during his time in British custody, which often resulted in beneficial treatment compared to those who had continued to profess their loyalty to the Fascist regime. On release he cycled and hitched lifts home. On Sunday 8 July 1945 he won the Circuit of the Aces in Milan after four years away from racing. The following season he won Milan–San Remo.

==Personal life==

Coppi&#x27;s beloved, &quot;The Woman in White&quot; was Giulia Occhini, described by the French broadcaster Jean-Paul Ollivier as &quot;strikingly beautiful with thick chestnut hair divided into enormous plaits&quot;. She was married to an army captain, Enrico Locatelli. Coppi was married to Bruna Ciampolini. Locatelli was a cycling fan. His wife wasn&#x27;t but she joined him on 8 August 1948 to see the Tre Valli Varesine race. Their car was caught beside Coppi&#x27;s in a traffic jam. That evening Occhini went to Coppi&#x27;s hotel and asked for a photograph. He wrote &quot;With friendship to ...&quot;, asked her name and then added it. From then on the two spent more and more time together.

Italy was a straight-laced country in which adultery was thought of poorly. In 1954, Luigi Boccaccini of &quot;La Stampa&quot; saw her waiting for Coppi at the end of a race in St-Moritz. She and Coppi hugged and &quot;La Stampa&quot; printed a picture in which she was described as &quot;la dama in bianco di Fausto Coppi&quot;—the &quot;woman in white of Fausto Coppi&quot;.

It took only a while to find out who she was. She and Coppi moved in together but so great was the scandal that the landlord of their apartment in Tortona demanded they move out. Reporters pursued them to a hotel in Castelletto d&#x27;Orba and again they moved, buying the Villa Carla, a house near Novi Ligure. There police raided them at night to see if they were sharing a bed. Pope Pius XII asked Coppi to return to his wife. He refused to bless the Giro d&#x27;Italia when Coppi rode it. The Pope then went through the Italian cycling federation. Its president, Bartolo Paschetta, wrote on 8 July 1954: &quot;Dear Fausto, yesterday evening St. Peter made it known to me that the news [of adultery] had caused him great pain&quot;.

Bruna Ciampolini refused a divorce. To end a marriage was shameful and still illegal in the country. Coppi was shunned and spectators spat at him. He and Giulia Occhini had a son, Faustino.

==Death==

In December 1959, the president of the Republic of Upper Volta (now known as Burkina Faso), Maurice Yaméogo, invited Coppi, Raphaël Géminiani, Jacques Anquetil, Louison Bobet, Roger Hassenforder and Henry Anglade to ride against local riders and then go hunting. Géminiani remembered:
&quot;I slept in the same room as Coppi in a house infested by mosquitos. I&#x27;d got used to them but Coppi hadn&#x27;t. Well, when I say we &#x27;slept&#x27;, that&#x27;s an overstatement. It was like the safari had been brought forward several hours, except that for the moment we were hunting mosquitos. Coppi was swiping at them with a towel. Right then, of course, I had no clue of what the tragic consequences of that night would be. Ten times, twenty times, I told Fausto &#x27;Do what I&#x27;m doing and get your head under the sheets; they can&#x27;t bite you there&#x27;&quot;.

Both caught malaria and fell ill when they got home. Géminiani said:
&quot;My temperature got to 41.6 °C ... I was delirious and I couldn&#x27;t stop talking. I imagined or maybe saw people all round but I didn&#x27;t recognise anyone. The doctor treated me for hepatitis, then for yellow fever, finally for typhoid&quot;.

Géminiani was diagnosed as being infected with &quot;plasmodium falciparum&quot;, one of the more lethal strains of malaria. Géminiani recovered but Coppi died, his doctors convinced he had a bronchial complaint. &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, the Italian daily sports paper, published a Coppi supplement. The editor wrote that he prayed that God would soon send another Coppi. Coppi was an atheist.
In January 2002 a man identified only as Giovanni, who lived in Burkina Faso until 1964, said Coppi died not of malaria but of an overdose of cocaine. The newspaper &quot;Corriere dello Sport&quot; said Giovanni had his information from Angelo Bonazzi. Giovanni said: &quot;It is Angelo who told me that Coppi had been killed. I was a supporter of Coppi, and you can imagine my state when he told me that Coppi had been poisoned in Fada Gourma, at the time of a reception organised by the head of the village. Angelo also told me that [Raphael] Géminiani was also present... Fausto&#x27;s plate fell, they replaced it, and then...&quot;

The story has also been attributed to a 75-year-old Benedictine monk called Brother Adrien. He told Mino Caudullo of the Italian National Olympic Committee: &quot;Coppi was killed with a potion mixed with grass. Here in Burkina Faso this awful phenomenon happens. People are still being killed like that&quot;. Coppi&#x27;s doctor, Ettore Allegri, dismissed the story as &quot;absolute drivel&quot;.

A court in Tortona opened an investigation and asked toxicologists about exhuming Coppi&#x27;s body to look for poison. A year later, without exhumation, the case was dismissed.

==Legacy==
The Giro remembers Coppi as it goes through the mountain stages. A mountain bonus, called the &quot;Cima Coppi&quot;, is awarded to the first rider who reaches the Giro&#x27;s highest summit. In 1999, Coppi placed second in balloting for greatest Italian athlete of the 20th century.

Coppi&#x27;s life story was depicted in the 1995 TV movie, &quot;Il Grande Fausto&quot;, written and directed by Alberto Sironi. Coppi was played by Sergio Castellitto and &quot;Giulia la &#x27;Dama Bianca&#x27; (The Woman in White)&quot; was played by Ornella Muti.

A commonly repeated trope is that when Coppi was asked how to be a champion, his reply was: &quot;Just ride. Just ride. Just ride.&quot; An Italian Restaurant in Belfast, designed with road bike parts and pictures, is named Coppi. Asteroid 214820 Faustocoppi was named in his memory in December 2017.

The village of his birth, previously known as &#x27;Castellania&#x27;, was renamed Castellania Coppi by the Piemont regional council in 2019, in preparation for the centenary of his birth.

==Doping==

Coppi was often said to have introduced &quot;modern&quot; methods to cycling, particularly his diet. Gino Bartali established that some of those methods included taking drugs, which were not then against the rules.

Bartali and Coppi appeared on television revues and sang together, Bartali singing about &quot;The drugs you used to take&quot; as he looked at Coppi. Coppi spoke of the subject in a television interview:

:&quot;Question&quot;: Do cyclists take &quot;la bomba&quot; (amphetamine)?
:&quot;Answer&quot;: Yes, and those who claim otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth talking to them about cycling.
:&quot;Question&quot;: And you, did you take &quot;la bomba&quot;?
:&quot;Answer&quot;: Yes. Whenever it was necessary.
:&quot;Question&quot;: And when was it necessary?
:&quot;Answer&quot;: Almost all the time!

Coppi &quot;set the pace&quot; in drug-taking, said his contemporary Wim van Est. Rik Van Steenbergen said Coppi was &quot;the first I knew who took drugs&quot;. That didn&#x27;t stop Coppi&#x27;s protesting against others using it. He told René de Latour:
&quot;What is the good of having world champions if those boys are worn out before turning professional? Maybe the officials are proud to come back with a rainbow jersey. but if this is done at the expense of the boys&#x27; futures, then I say it&#x27;s wrong. Do you think it normal that our best amateurs become nothing but &#x27;gregari&#x27;?&quot;

<doc id="317024" wikidata="Q662637" url="?curid=317024" title="Federal Charter of 1291">
<text>The Federal Charter or Letter of Alliance () is one of the earliest constitutional documents of Switzerland. A treaty of alliance from 1291 between the cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, the Charter is one of a series of alliances from which the Old Swiss Confederacy emerged. In the 19th and 20th century, after the establishment of the Swiss federal state, the Charter became the central founding document of Switzerland in the popular imagination.

The Charter documents the Eternal Alliance of the League of the Three Forest Cantons (), the union of three cantons in what is now central Switzerland. It is dated to early August 1291, which in the 20th century inspired the date of Swiss National Day, 1 August. Done in Latin, the Charter makes reference to a previous (lost or unwritten) pact. It is now exhibited at the Museum of the Swiss Charters of Confederation in Schwyz.

==Contents==
The Alliance was concluded between the people of the alpine areas of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden (). The participants are referred to as &quot;conspirati&quot; and (synonymously) &quot;coniurati&quot;, traditionally translated in German as &quot;Eidgenossen&quot; (and in English as &quot;Confederates&quot;).

The Charter was probably intended to ensure legal certainty after the death of Rudolf I of Habsburg on 15 July 1291. The first two paragraphs commit all three communities to the joint defence of the three valleys. The remainder of the Charter concerns judicial matters: It calls for arbitration in the case of conflicts, rejects foreign judges, establishes the death penalty for murderers and exile for arsonists, and commands obedience to judges and judicial verdicts.

==Date and context==
The authenticity of the letter used to be disputed as a supposed modern forgery, but historians now agree that it is certainly a product of the 14th century. In 1991, the parchment was radiocarbon dated at ETH to between 1252 and 1312 (with a probability of 85%); alternatively, it could date to between 1352 and 1385 (with a probability of 15%).

The document is thus not a forgery, tied to the emergence of the modern federal state in 1848, but should rather be seen in the context of Chapter 15 of the Golden Bull of 1356 in which Charles IV outlawed any &quot;conjurationes, confederationes,&quot; and &quot;conspirationes&quot;, meaning in particular the city alliances (&quot;Städtebünde&quot;), but also other communal leagues that had sprung up through the communal movement in medieval Europe. It was then very common to produce documents only when needed. At the time, agreements were most often verbal, and any documentation drawn up later might have its contents or dates changed to suit current purposes.

The charter was part of a system of defensive pacts among the polities that later became the Swiss cantons. They include the following, also on display at the Museum of the Swiss Charters of Confederation:
* 1315: Federal Charter of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden 9 December 1315 (aka Pact of Brunnen)
* 1332: Charter of the City of Lucerne with Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden
* 1352: Charter with Glarus
* 1352: Charter with Zug
* 1451: Contract with St. Gallen Abbey and Zürich, Lucerne and Schwyz and Glarus
* 1454: Eternal Contract for St. Gallen with Zürich, Bern, Lucerne and Schwyz, Zug and Glarus
* 1464: Contract of Rapperswil with the abovementioned
* 1481: Contract of Freiburg und Solothurn
* 1501: Contract with Basel of which the number of copies is known to be 11, corresponding to the 11 seals.
* 1501: Contract with Schaffhausen
* 1513: Contract with Appenzell

== Modern reception ==
The charter of 1291 became important in the historiography of Switzerland only in the late 19th century. Previously, the date of the foundation of the Confederacy had been traditionally given as 1307 (Aegidius Tschudi);
this is the year inscribed for example on the Tell Monument, commissioned in 1895.

The idea of the charter of 1291 representing the founding document of the Confederacy was first suggested in a report by the Federal Department of Home Affairs of 21 November 1889, in the context of a proposed combined celebration of the 700th anniversary of the foundation of Bern and the 600th anniversary of the Confederacy in 1891. Celebration of a national holiday on 1 August based on the date on the document was first suggested in 1899 (although it was introduced officially only in 1994).

The idea to build a dedicated national monument housing the foundational documents of the Confederacy was first proposed in 1891 by federal councillors Emil Welti and Carl Schenk. This plan was revisited in 1915 during the preparation of the 600th anniversary celebration for the Battle of Morgarten, but its realisation was delayed due to World War I. After the war, the canton of Schwyz requested federal support for the project, which was granted in 1928. Designed by Joseph Beeler in 1933, the &quot;Bundesbriefarchiv&quot; (Federal Charter Archive) was opened in 1936. In 1979/80, the exhibition hall was renovated, and restoration work was carried out on the 21 banners and flags displayed in the museum. In 1998/99, the exhibition was re-arranged. In the meantime, the institution changed its name to &quot;Bundesbriefmuseum&quot; (Museum of the Swiss Charters of Confederation).

<text>World Aquatics, formerly known as FINA (; ), is the international federation recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for administering international competitions in water sports. It is one of several international federations which administer a given sport or discipline for both the IOC and the international community. It is based in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Founded as FINA (; ) in 1908, the federation was officially renamed World Aquatics in January 2023.

World Aquatics currently oversees competition in six aquatics sports: 
swimming, 
diving, 
high diving,
artistic swimming, water polo, and open water swimming. World Aquatics also oversees &quot;Masters&quot; competition (for adults) in its disciplines.

==History==

FINA was founded on 19 July 1908 in the Manchester Hotel in London, at the end of the 1908 Summer Olympics. Eight national federations were responsible for the formation of FINA: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary and Sweden.

In 1973 the first World Aquatics Championships were staged in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, with competitions held in swimming, water polo, diving and synchronized swimming. Dr. Hal Henning, who had formerly served as Chair of the U.S. Olympic Swim Committee, was FINA&#x27;s first American president from 1972 through 1976 where he was highly instrumental in starting the first World Aquatics Championships in Belgrade, and in retaining the number of swimming events in the Olympics which favored countries with larger, more balanced swim teams.

In 1986 the first permanent FINA office was opened in Lausanne, Switzerland.

In 1991 open water swimming was added to the program of the World Aquatics Championships.

In 1993 the first edition of the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) was staged in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.

In 2010 FINA convened the first edition of the FINA World Aquatics Convention in Punta del Este, Uruguay. 

In 2013 high diving was added to the program of the World Aquatics Championships.

In 2015 FINA staged the first dual World Aquatics Championships and FINA World Masters Championships (later known World Aquatics Masters Championships) in Kazan Russia, run consecutively in the one city for the first time.

In 2018 FINA celebrated 110 years by inaugurating a new headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 

On 12 December 2022, during the Extraordinary General Congress held in Melbourne, Australia, the Congress approved a new Constitution and voted to adopt a new name for the organisation, World Aquatics.

In July 2023, the World Aquatics General Congress approved the headquarters would be moving to Budapest, Hungary (host city of the 2017, 2022 and 2027 championships) was in the ‘final stage’ of negotiations to move. The center is scheduled to be finished by the end of 2026, but the organization intends to move some of it to the Hungarian capital in the second half of next year. In November 2024, they opened their interim office before a full, complete transfer by 2027.

Number of national federations by year:
*1908: 8
*1928: 38
*1958: 75
*1978: 106
*1988: 109
*2000: 174
*2008: 197
*2010: 202
*2012: 203
*2015: 208
*2016: 207
*2017: 209
*2023: 208

==Members==
In June 2017, Bhutan became the 208th national member federation of FINA (now World Aquatics); and on 30 November 2017, Anguilla became the 209th national member federation. In 2023 the Philippines were removed from the list of member federations on the World Aquatics website. At the World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka in July 2023 athletes from the Philippines were still competing as &#x27;Suspended Member Federation&#x27;, however by the World Aquatics Junior Swimming Championships in September 2023, athletes from the Philippines were required to compete as &#x27;Neutral Independent Athletes&#x27;. Athletes from Kenya currently compete as &#x27;Suspended Member Federation&#x27;, while athletes from Russia and Belarus are currently banned from competing, but the nation&#x27;s are still listed as member federations. World Aquatics also permits athletes not affiliated with a member federation to compete at events under the &#x27;Athlete Refugee Team&#x27; banner. 
Members are grouped by continent, and there are 5 continental associations of which they can choose to be a member:

*Africa (52): Africa Aquatics
*Americas (45): PanAm Aquatics
*Asia (44): Asia Aquatics
*Europe (52): European Aquatics
*Oceania (15): Oceania Aquatics
==Organisation &amp; Structure==
Under the new World Aquatics Constitution, ratified in December 2022, under clause 12, the following bodies are established to govern and administer World Aquatics:

* The Congress
* The Bureau
* The Executive
* The Aquatics Integrity Unit
* The Athletes Committee
* The Technical Committees
* The Specialised Committees 

The World Aquatics Congress is the highest authority of World Aquatics and shall have the power to decide upon any matters arising within World Aquatics. A Congress is held either as an Ordinary Congress or as an Extraordinary Congress. A Congress may be held in person, by teleconference, by video conference or by another means of communication. Voting by correspondence (including email) and/or online is permitted. An Ordinary Congress shall be held every two (2) years, in principle at the site and on the occasion of the World Championships or of another major World Aquatics event. An Extraordinary Congress shall be convened either by a decision of the Bureau or following a request in writing submitted to the Bureau by email by at least one fifth (1/5) of the Members. Each Member shall be represented by up to two (2) duly appointed delegates with voting rights. Each of the twenty (20) elected members of the Athletes Committee shall have one (1) vote at a Congress. The Honorary President is chair with no voting power. Continental Organisations can appoint up to two (2) representatives who may attend the Congress as observers, without any voting power.

The World Aquatics Bureau consists of the President and thirty-nine (39) Bureau Members:

* President: The President is elected by the Congress.   
* Continental Representatives: Twenty-two (22) Bureau Members are elected by the Congress as continental representatives distributed geographically and per gender as follows: Africa: five (5), with no more than three (3) representatives of a single gender; America: five (5), with no more than three (3) representatives of a single gender; Asia: five (5), with no more than three (3) representatives of a single gender; Europe: five (5), with no more than three (3) representatives of a single gender; and Oceania: two (2), with one (1) of each gender. From these roles elected are five (5) Vice Presidents, one from each of the five Continents, including the First Vice President and the Second Vice President; and the Treasurer.

* World-at-Large Bureau Members: Sixteen (16) additional Bureau Members are elected by the Congress as World-at-Large Bureau Members, distributed geographically and per gender as follows: Africa: three (3), with no more than two (2) representatives of a single gender; America: four (4), with no more than three (3) representatives of a single gender; Asia: four (4), with no more than three (3) representatives of a single gender; Europe: four (4), with no more than three (3) representatives of a single gender; and Oceania: one (1), female or male.

* Athletes Committee: The Chair of the Athletes Committee is ex officio a Bureau Member.

Various committees and commissions also help with the oversight of individual disciplines (e.g. the Technical Open Water Swimming Committee helps with open water), or topic-related issues (e.g. the World Aquatics Doping Panel). The organization signed an agreement with the Hungarian government in May 2023, planning to relocate its headquarters from Switzerland to Budapest, Hungary. However, the World Aquatics Congress needs to approve unanimously in order for the relocation to be finalized.

==Current bureau members==
==Presidents==
Each presidential term is four years, beginning and concluding with the year following the Summer Olympics.

==Tournaments ==
===World Aquatics Championships===
World Aquatics&#x27; largest event is the biennial World Aquatics Championships, traditionally held every odd year, where all of the six aquatic disciplines are contested. A 50m length pool is used for swimming races.

The World Open Water Swimming Championships (also known as &#x27;Open Water Worlds&#x27;) is part of the World Aquatics Championships. Additional standalone editions of the Open Water Championships were also held in the even years from 2000 to 2010.

The World Masters Championships (also known as &#x27;Masters Worlds) is open to athletes 25 years and above (30+ years in water polo) in each aquatics discipline excluding high diving and has been held as part of the World Aquatics Championships since 2015. Prior to this, the Masters Championship was held separately, biennially in even years.

Prior to the 9th World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka in 2001, the championships had been staged at various intervals of two to four years. From 2001 to 2019 the championships were held biennially in odd years. Due to interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions, and host venues withdrawing from hosting championships and World Aquatics withdrawing the rights to host championships, from 2022 to 2025 the championships will be staged in every year until resuming to biennial from 2025 onwards.

=== Stand-alone discipline competitions ===
World Aquatics also organizes separate tournaments and series for individual disciplines, including competitions for juniors.

==== Discipline world tournaments ====
*Swimming: World Swimming Championships (25m), (also known as &#x27;Short Course Worlds&#x27;, an even-years biennial event held in 25m length pool)
*Water polo: Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Water Polo World Cup, replacing the former Water Polo World Leagues
*Diving: Diving World Cup (biennial)
*High diving: High Diving World Cup (annual)

==== Discipline world series ====
*Swimming: Swimming World Cup (annual usually in 25m pool, but held in 50m pool in pre-Olympic years)
*Diving: Diving World Series (annual)
*Artistic swimming: Artistic Swimming World Cup (annual - called World Series 2017–2022)
*Open water swimming: Marathon Swim World Series (annual)

==== Junior championships ====
World-level championships restricted to a younger age, with the age limit varying by discipline and gender:
*Swimming: World Junior Swimming Championships (biennial)
*Water polo: Junior, Youth and Cadet Water Polo World Championships (biennial)
*Diving: World Junior Diving Championships (biennial)
*Artistic swimming: World Junior Artistic Swimming Championships (biennial)
*Open water swimming: World Junior Open Water Swimming Championships (biennial)

==Sport name changes==
In 2017, FINA officially renamed the sport of synchronised swimming as Artistic Swimming for its competitions to reflect the expansion in evaluation criteria in the sport to include not only synchronization but other elements such as choreography and artistic expression.

==Bans==
===Retired athletes===
In relation to anti-doping rule violations, World Aquatics does enact suspensions on athletes who are retired from their respective sport at the time of ban implementation, with examples including Lithuanian Rūta Meilutytė (2019–2021) and Russians Artem Lobuzov (2021–2025), Alexandra Sokolova (2021–2025), and Artem Podyakov (2021–2025).

===Russia and Belarus bans===
Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials were banned from every FINA (World Aquatics) event through the end of 2022. FINA also cancelled FINA events in Russia, and banned Russian and Belarusian teams through to the 19th FINA World Championships Budapest 2022. In March 2022, after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FINA banned all Russians and Belarusians from competing at the 2022 World Aquatics Championships and withdrew the 2022 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) from being held in Russia. This came after indefinitely banning athletes and officials of both countries from wearing the colours of their country, swimming representing their country with their country&#x27;s name, and the playing of their country&#x27;s national anthem in case an athlete from either country won an event. Additionally, times swum by Russians at non-FINA competitions for the April to December 2022 time frame did not count for world rankings nor world records. On the 4 September 2023, World Aquatics announced the capacity and criteria for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete at competitions as &#x27;Neutral Independent Athletes&#x27;.

==Controversies==
=== Transgender athlete restrictions ===

On 19 June 2022, FINA (World Aquatics) &quot;committed to the separation of Aquatics sports into men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s categories according to sex&quot; by a 71% vote, adopting a new policy on eligibility for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competition categories. This policy effectively bars all transgender women from competing in professional women&#x27;s swimming, with the exception of athletes who &quot;can establish to FINA&#x27;s comfortable satisfaction that they have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2 (of puberty) or before age 12, whichever is later&quot;. Athletes who previously took masculinizing hormone therapy (namely testosterone) may also compete in the women&#x27;s category as long any testosterone use was post-puberty and less than a year in total, and the person&#x27;s testosterone levels are back to pre-treatment levels. Transgender men remained fully eligible to compete in the men&#x27;s category. FINA also announced the development of a separate &quot;open&quot; category for some events, to be determined by a working group over the next six months, so that &quot;everybody has the opportunity to compete at an elite level&quot;. The decision was criticized as &quot;discriminatory, harmful, unscientific and not in line with the 2021 IOC principles&quot; by LGBT advocacy group Athlete Ally.

Though swimmer Lia Thomas formally challenged the new rule that disqualified her from competition, in June 2024, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that she lacked standing to do so and would remain ineligible to compete.

=== Vice President Zhou Jihong ===
In May 2022, New Zealand diving judge Lisa Wright revealed that during the 2020 Summer Olympics, FINA Vice President, Zhou Jihong, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the conclusion of the men&#x27;s 10m platform final. Wright alleged that Zhou verbally abused her for underscoring Chinese divers. Diving New Zealand subsequently complained about the incident to FINA&#x27;s Ethics Panel. As a result, Zhou was ordered by in a FINA Ethics Panel decision to write a letter of apology to Wright. A recommendation was also made by the Ethics Panel to disestablish Zhou&#x27;s position as Diving Bureau Liaison for FINA. The FINA Ethics Panel stated that the incident during the men&#x27;s platform final was &quot;unfortunate&quot; and led to a &quot;misunderstanding mixed with misjudgement&quot; between Wright and Zhou.

In May 2022, former international diver, Olympic judge and previous member of FINA&#x27;s Technical Diving Committee from New Zealand Simon Latimer revealed he had sent a whistleblower complaint to FINA&#x27;s Executive Director Brent Nowicki in December 2021 detailing Zhou&#x27;s alleged &quot;unethical behavior&quot; which also contained allegations that Zhou has routinely coached Chinese divers during major events such as the Olympics and World Championships and she had manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes. Latimer claimed that Zhou&#x27;s behavior was tarnishing the reputation of international diving and that she was acting in the interests of China rather than international diving as a whole.

Subsequent to Latimer&#x27;s complaint, video evidence emerged online showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers during competition sessions at the 2020 Summer Olympics, a behavior considered unethical given her supposedly neutral role as a FINA Vice President and Diving Bureau Liaison.

In July 2022, Latimer was not re-elected to FINA&#x27;s Technical Diving Committee, and Zhou was one of the FINA Bureau Member&#x27;s who had input in the selection process. In 2022 FINA&#x27;s By Laws were updated to state that the Bureau Liaison position that Zhou holds should not interfere on the field of play during competitions and that individuals holding that position shall not act as a Team Leader or coach at international events including the Olympic Games.
===Soul Cap===
In 2021, FINA (World Aquatics) came under criticism for not approving the use at the Olympics of the Soul Cap, a brand of swimming caps designed for natural Black hair. FINA said the caps did not fit &quot;the natural form of the head&quot; and to their &quot;best knowledge the athletes competing at the international events never used, neither require … caps of such size and configuration.&quot; After receiving criticism about racism, FINA announced that they would review their decision. Later in 2022, FINA decided to approve the Soul Caps for future FINA events (effective immediately).

=== Doping ===

In 2024, a member of the World Aquatics&#x27; anti-doping advisory body said that it was &quot;inexplicably and forcibly shut out of the review&quot; concerning positive tests from 23 Chinese swimmers in the lead-up to the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics. As a result of the doping scandal, in June 2024, a former deputy director of the World Anti-Doping Agency said that athletes had &quot;zero confidence&quot; in World Aquatics. In July 2024, World Aquatics confirmed that its executive director was subpoenaed to testify to U.S. authorities as part of a criminal investigation into the Chinese swimmers&#x27; doping tests.

<text>A roommate is a person with whom one shares a living facility such as a room or dormitory &quot;except&quot; when being family or romantically involved. Similar terms include dorm-mate, suite-mate, housemate, or flatmate (&quot;flat&quot;: the usual term in British English for an apartment). Flatmate is the term most commonly used in New Zealand, when referring to the rental of an unshared room within any type of dwelling. Another similar term is sharemate (shared living spaces are often called &quot;sharehouses&quot; in Australia and other Commonwealth countries). A sharehome is a model of household in which a group of usually unrelated people reside together, including lease-by-room arrangements. The term generally applies to people living together in rental properties rather than in properties in which any resident is an owner occupier. In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;roommate&quot; means a person sharing the same &quot;bedroom&quot;; in the United States and Canada, &quot;roommate&quot; and &quot;housemate&quot; are used interchangeably regardless of whether a bedroom is shared, although at US universities having a roommate commonly implies sharing a bedroom. This article uses the term &quot;roommate&quot; in the US sense of a person one shares a &quot;residence&quot; with who is not a relative or significant other. The informal term for roommate is roomie, which is commonly used by university students and members of the younger generation.

The most common reason for sharing housing is to reduce the cost of housing. In many rental markets, the monthly rent for a two- or three-bedroom apartment is proportionately less per bedroom than the rent for a one-bedroom apartment (in other words, a three-bedroom flat costs more than a one-bedroom, but not three times as much). By pooling their monthly housing money, a group of people can achieve a lower housing expense at the cost of less privacy. Other motivations are to gain better amenities than those available in single-person housing, to share the work of maintaining a household, and to have the companionship of other people.

People become roommates when they move into a rental property, with one or more of them having applied to rent the property through a real estate agent, being accepted and having signed a lease.

==Demographics==
Housemates and roommates are typically unmarried young adults, including workers and students. It is not rare for middle-aged and elderly adults who are single, divorced, or widowed to have housemates. Married couples, however, typically discontinue living with roommates, especially when they have children.

Those moving to another city or another country may decide to look for a shared house or apartment to avoid loneliness. Social changes such as the declining affordability of home ownership and decreasing marriage rates are reasons why people may choose to live with roommates. Despite this rise, shared housing is little researched.

Roommates are a fairly common point of reference in Western culture. In the United States, most young adults spend at least a short part of their lives living with roommates after they leave their family&#x27;s home. Very often this involves moving out of the home and to college, where the primary option for living is with a roommate. Therefore, many novels, movies, plays, and television programs employ roommates as a basic principle or a plot device (such as the popular series &quot;Friends&quot; or &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;). Sharing a house or a flat is also very common in European countries such as France (French &quot;colocation&quot;, corenting) or Germany (German &quot;WG&quot; for &quot;Wohngemeinschaft&quot;, living [together] community). Many websites are specialized in finding a flatmate. On the other hand, it is less common for people of any age to live with roommates in some countries, such as Japan, where single-person one-room apartments are plentiful.

There are many different forms of flat shares also, from the more established flat shares where the flatmate will get their own room that is furnished to &quot;couch surfing&quot; where people lend their sofa for a short period.
Sharehome residents are typically unrelated to each other in that they generally come from different families, although they may be composed of some siblings and sometimes single parents and their children. Perhaps because of the social cohesion required for their formation, sharehomes will often be composed of members of the same peer group. For example, university students who have relocated to a new area to commence a course of study often need to form a sharehome. Share housing often occurs in the 18–35 age bracket—during a life stage between leaving home and having children. Sharehome residents may have pre-existing friendships or other interpersonal relationships or they may form new relationships whilst living together.

Many universities in the United States require first-year students to live in on-campus residence halls, sharing a dormitory room with a same-sex roommate.

==Popularity==
According to the American Community Survey, 7.7% of Americans lived with a roommate in 2014. From 2000 to 2014, the proportion of Americans living with roommates increased by 13%, revealing that it is an increasingly common housing situation.

The change in the cost of housing makes the consideration of roommates more attractive. As housing costs rise, so too does the rate of living as roommates. When prices drop, the opposite can be expected. This has been seen extensively in cities such as Washington D.C., Phoenix, and San Diego.

Student exchanges are getting more and more popular with globalization and has influenced a lot in the Roommate Boom. The Erasmus exchange program in Europe has contributed as being the biggest exchange program in Europe. Exchange students can live in university residences but a growing number want to share apartments with other international students in shared apartments.

Roommates and house-sharing are not limited to students and young adults however. American politicians Chuck Schumer, William Delahunt, Richard Durbin, and George Miller famously share a house in Washington, D.C., while Congress is in session.

In Indian universities and colleges it is quite common that students share their rooms with a couple of others. Usually students in the master or doctoral programs are allocated with own rooms.

Sharing an apartment is quite popular with young adults (most of them university students) in countries like Germany, Austria and Switzerland, while sharing a bedroom is more uncommon.

===Cities with most roommates in the United States===
The following table lists the top 25 US cities by proportion of people who live with roommates according to the US Census 2016 and a 2017 Zillow housing trends report.
==Challenges==
One difficulty is finding suitable roommates. Living with a roommate can mean much less privacy than having a residence of one&#x27;s own, and for some people this can cause a lot of stress. Another thing to consider when choosing a roommate is how to divide the cost of living. Who pays for what, or are the shared expenses divided between the two or more roommates. Also, the potential roommate should be trusted to pay their share and trusted to pay it on time. Sleeping patterns can also be disrupted when living with a number of people. Some of the challenges that come with share housing may include advertising for, interviewing and choosing potential housemates; sharing communal household goods, rent (often this may be determined by the size or position of respective bedrooms); sharing household bills and grocery costs; and sharing housework, cleaning, and cooking responsibilities. Conflicts may arise if, for example, residents have different standards of cleanliness, different diets, or different hours of employment or study. Guests and partners may also begin to board frequently, which can raise complications pertaining to utility expenses, additional rent and further possible cleaning duties. Often when these responsibilities go untended, friction may result between co-tenants. For this reason, responsibilities should be delegated and fairly assigned as early as possible in any living arrangement with roommates. A clear and defined list of alternating chores and bill lists are easy to see and enforce.

Roommates matter, as they have a great impression upon the ones whom they live with and therefore surround themselves by. More and more research has been produced in order to properly understand this impact. The areas of impact can vary greatly in both positive and negative ways; most important is that individuals should be aware of the possible behaviour and social changes that may happen when living with a roommate.

===Eating and drinking habits===
Living with an individual who exercises and diets can be beneficial because it very often &quot;rubs off&quot; on the other roommates, while a calorie cutting roommate could be a potential negative influence. College is a time that students often start drinking, specifically binge drinking (more than 4 or 5 drinks in a row). By the end of second semester in college 53% of freshman students had binged. Students explained that having a drinking roommate provided a “buddy” to go through it all and was a big influence in the decision to do so. 

Mood susceptible: &quot;Each happy friend a person has increases that person&#x27;s probability of being happy by 9 percent and each unhappy friend decreases it by 7 percent,&quot; says Nicholas A. Christakis, a co-author of &quot;Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives&quot;. Whether the roommates are friends or not the interactions and behaviors shared and expressed will undoubtedly have an effect on the roommates. Although shown not to be as impressionable as eating habits, our moods can change, specifically more in roommates based on the others emotions.

Effects on studies: Studies showed that having a roommate that plays video games causes the other to most likely participate, which reflected in a half-hour less of studying, also showing GPA&#x27;s .02 lower than others. When dealing with a college roommate the choice to study or sleep should take precedence over the choice to party or play loud music. This understanding allows those to choose to focus differently on school to do so without harm to the roommate relationship or grades.

Addressing an issue:
The best approach to address an issue with a roommate is an upfront and in person conversation, preferably a one on one conversation. While approaching the issues understand and respect each other&#x27;s differences. When discussing the issues allow both sides to express their thoughts and feelings on the issue. And after both listening and speaking to each other present a resolution. and in doing so create a win-win situation this allows for the conflict to be more easily resolved. The resolution may not be the personal idea, but it should help the situation to some degree.

<text>Hobson&#x27;s Choice is a play by Harold Brighouse, the title taken from the popular expression, Hobson&#x27;s choice—meaning no choice at all (from Thomas Hobson 1545–1631, who ran a thriving livery stable in Cambridge).

The first production was at the Princess Theatre in New York on November 2, 1915. It then transferred to London on 24 June 1916 at the Apollo Theatre, before moving to the Prince of Wales Theatre on 20 November 1916 (starring Norman McKinnel, as Henry Hobson, Edyth Goodall as Maggie Hobson and Joe Nightingale as Willie Mossop). It was performed by the National Theatre at the Old Vic, London in 1964 (starring Michael Redgrave, Joan Plowright and Frank Finlay.) The play was adapted for film several times and as a Broadway musical. The Crucible Theatre Sheffield staged a revival in June 2011 directed by Christopher Luscombe and starring Barrie Rutter, Zoe Waites and Philip McGinley.In June 2016, &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; opened at The Vaudeville Theatre, running until 10 September 2016. Martin Shaw played Hobson.

The story is set in Salford in 1880. It bears many resemblances to the stories of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot; including a deceased mother; three daughters, two of whom are pretty and frivolous, the third of whom is clever and hardworking; and a fairy godmother (Mrs. Hepworth).

*Henry Horatio Hobson
*Maggie Hobson (&quot;Hobson&#x27;s oldest daughter&quot;)
*Alice Hobson (&quot;Hobson&#x27;s daughter&quot;)
*Vickey Hobson (&quot;Hobson&#x27;s daughter&quot;)
*Mrs. Hepworth (&quot;a wealthy customer of Hobson&#x27;s&quot;)

==Plot==
A shoemaker, Henry Hobson, has three daughters: Maggie, Alice and Vickey. The daughters work in the shop unpaid. Hobson spends his time drinking with the fellow members of the masons at the Moonrakers pub.

One day, Mrs Hepworth, a rich customer of Hobson, demands to know who made her boots: it is Hobson&#x27;s underpaid bootmaker, Will Mossop. She insists that all her and her daughters&#x27; boots must from now on be made by Will, and tells him to inform her if ever he should leave Hobson&#x27;s. Maggie, who is a talented businesswoman and considered too old and plain to marry, proposes marriage to Will. Will reluctantly agrees. When Hobson comes back, she tells him that she intends to marry Will, but he laughs at her, and threatens to beat Will for courting her. At this, Will leaves the shop, and Maggie goes with him. They borrow £100 from Mrs Hepworth, set up a shop on their own, and marry as soon as the banns of marriage have been called.

A month later, Hobson falls into the warehouse belonging to the father of Fred Beenstock, Vickey&#x27;s love. Maggie comes back to tell her sisters that she is going to marry them off herself. Hobson has refused to settle any money on them, without which they are unlikely to find decent husbands. With the help of lawyer Albert Prosser, Alice&#x27;s love, they issue a writ claiming damages from Hobson for trespass, damage to corn sacks and spying on trade secrets. Hobson eventually agrees to pay, the money is settled on the girls and they can now get married.

Thanks to Will&#x27;s skill as a bootmaker and Maggie&#x27;s business acumen, their shop is very successful and, within a year, they have taken nearly all of Hobson&#x27;s trade. Hobson is almost bankrupt and drinking himself to death. After an attack of delirium tremens, he asks each of his daughters to look after him. They all refuse, but eventually Maggie agrees to do so provided that Will takes over his business, with Hobson remaining as a sleeping partner only.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
The play has been filmed several times, originally as a silent film in 1920, with Joan Ritz as Maggie, Arthur Pitt as her father and Joe Nightingale reprising his stage appearance as Mossop. It was filmed again with sound in 1931, with James Harcourt as Hobson, Frank Pettingell as Mossop, Joan Maude as Alice, and Viola Lyel as Maggie. The best-known film version is that of 1954 directed by David Lean. It starred Charles Laughton as Hobson and Brenda De Banzie as Maggie. John Mills played Will Mossop, and Prunella Scales made her second film appearance as Vicky Hobson.

It was Americanized in the 1983 TV version, set in 1914 New Orleans, starring Jack Warden as Hobson, Sharon Gless as Maggie, and Richard Thomas as Will. It was broadcast on CBS TV on 21 December 1983. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review summarized the story line thus: &quot;Burt Prelutsky&#x27;s script transposes the setting to New Orleans, and the year, for whatever arbitrary reason, is 1914. Henry Horatio Hobson, owner of a successful shoe store, is still a carousing drunk, complaining about how fate has saddled him with three daughters. Maggie, his eldest, can barely conceal her contempt for daddy&#x27;s more outrageous ways, and she is determined to get out from under his domination. As her vehicle toward that end, she chooses Will, a gentle and illiterate master shoemaker working in Hobson&#x27;s basement.&quot; The review goes on: &quot;Much of the problem would seem to be rooted in the casting. Jack Warden is an accomplished actor but he is at his best in the big-city settings of New York, Chicago or Los Angeles. He is not terribly persuasive as a New Orleans gentleman, albeit a drunken one. Sharon Gless is more successful with Maggie, giving the character an admirably unyielding integrity. But her performance doesn&#x27;t quite jibe with that of Richard Thomas as Will.&quot;

===Broadway===
The 1966 Broadway musical &quot;Walking Happy&quot; is based on the play.

===Ballet===
An English ballet adaptation of the same title, with choreography by David Bintley and music by Paul Reade, premiered on 13 February 1989 by Sadler&#x27;s Wells Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, London. A video production of the ballet has been seen on television broadcasts and released on DVD.

<doc id="317047" wikidata="Q2144192" url="?curid=317047" title="Associationism">
<text>Associationism is the idea that mental processes operate by the association of one mental state with its successor states. It holds that all mental processes are made up of discrete psychological elements and their combinations, which are believed to be made up of sensations or simple feelings. In philosophy, this idea is viewed as the outcome of empiricism and sensationism. The concept encompasses a psychological theory as well as comprehensive philosophical foundation and scientific methodology.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The idea is first recorded in Plato and Aristotle, especially with regard to the succession of memories. Particularly, the model is traced back to the Aristotelian notion that human memory encompasses all mental phenomena. The model was discussed in detail in the philosopher&#x27;s work, &quot;Memory and Reminiscence&quot;. This view was then widely embraced until the emergence of British associationism, which began with Thomas Hobbes.
=== Associationist School ===
Members of the Associationist School, including John Locke, David Hume, David Hartley, Joseph Priestley, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, Alexander Bain, and Ivan Pavlov, asserted that the principle applied to all or most mental processes.

==== John Locke ====
The phrase &quot;association of ideas&quot; was first used by John Locke in 1689. In chapter 33 of &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, which is entitled “Of the Association of Ideas″, he describes the ways that ideas can be connected to each other. He writes, Although he believed that some associations were natural and justified, he believed that others were illogical, causing errors in judgment. He also explains that one can associate some ideas together based on their education and culture, saying, &quot;there is another connection of ideas wholly owing to chance or custom&quot;. The term &quot;associationism&quot; later became more prominent in psychology and the psychologists who subscribed to the idea became known as &quot;the associationists&quot;. Locke&#x27;s view that the mind and body are two aspects of the same unified phenomenon can be traced back to Aristotle&#x27;s ideas on the subject.

==== David Hume ====
In his 1740 book &quot;Treatise on Human Nature&quot; David Hume outlines three principles for ideas to be connected to each other: resemblance, continuity in time or place, and cause or effect. He argues that the mind uses these principles, rather than reason, to traverse from idea to idea. He writes “When the mind, therefore, passes from the idea or impression of one object to the idea or belief of another, it is not determined by reason, but by certain principles, which associate together the ideas of these objects, and unite them in the imagination.” These connections are formed in the mind by observation and experience. Hume does not believe that any of these associations are “necessary’ in a sense that ideas or object are truly connected, instead he sees them as mental tools used for creating a useful mental representation of the world.

==== Later members ====
Later members of the school developed very specific principles elaborating how associations worked and even a physiological mechanism bearing no resemblance to modern neurophysiology. For a fuller explanation of the intellectual history of associationism and the &quot;Associationist School&quot;, see &quot;Association of Ideas&quot;.

== Applications ==
Associationism is often concerned with middle-level to higher-level mental processes such as learning. For instance, the thesis, antithesis, and synthesis are linked in one&#x27;s mind through repetition so that they become inextricably associated with one another. Among the earliest experiments that tested the applications of associationism, involve Hermann Ebbinghaus&#x27; work. He was considered the first experimenter to apply the associationist principles systematically, and used himself as subject to study and quantify the relationship between rehearsal and recollection of material.

Some of the ideas of the Associationist School also anticipated the principles of conditioning and its use in behavioral psychology. Both classical conditioning and operant conditioning use positive and negative associations as means of conditioning.

<text>Emma Eckstein (1865–1924) was an Austrian author. She was &quot;one of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s most important patients and, for a short period of time around 1897, became a psychoanalyst herself&quot;. She has been described as &quot;the first woman analyst&quot;, who became &quot;both colleague and patient&quot; for Freud. As analyst, while working mainly in the area of sexual and social hygiene, she also explored how &#x27;daydreams, those &quot;parasitic plants&quot;, invaded the life of young girls&#x27;.

Ernest Jones placed her with such figures as Lou Andreas-Salomé and Joan Riviere as a &quot;type of woman, of a more intellectual and perhaps masculine cast ... [who] played a part in his life, accessory to his male friends though of a finer calibre.&quot;

==Life==

Emma Eckstein was born in Vienna on 28 January 1865 to a well-known bourgeois family with close connections to Freud: one of her brothers was Gustav Eckstein (1875–1916), a social democrat and associate of Karl Kautsky, the leader of the Socialist Party; and a sister, Therese Schlesinger, a socialist, was one of the first women members of parliament. Another brother, Friedrich, appears (anonymously) in Freud&#x27;s &quot;Civilization and its Discontents&quot; as a &#x27;friend of mine, whose insatiable craving for knowledge has led him to make the most unusual experiments&#x27;, including &#x27;the practices of yoga...He sees in them a physiological basis, as it were, for much of the wisdom of mysticism&#x27;.

Eckstein was active in the Viennese women&#x27;s movement, collaborating with &quot;Dokumente der Frauen&quot; and &quot;Neues Frauenleben&quot;.

After an operation in 1910, however, Eckstein took to her couch, and remained a partial invalid until she died on 30 July 1924 of a cerebral hemorrhage.

==Analysis==

When she was 27, she went to Freud, seeking treatment for vague symptoms including stomach ailments and slight depression related to menstruation. Freud diagnosed Eckstein as suffering from hysteria and believed that she masturbated to excess; masturbation in those days was considered dangerous to mental health. Her &#x27;treatment lasted something in the region of three years – one of the most protracted and detailed of Freud&#x27;s early cases&#x27;.

In her analysis, Emma Eckstein &quot;supplied Freud with the material that would allow him to theorize hysteric symptomology...taught Freud about &#x27;the no-man&#x27;s land between fantasy and memory, resonating with sadistic acts and fantasies of a former historical epoch&#x27;.&quot; She told Freud that “On two occasions, when she was a child of eight, she had gone into a shop to buy some sweets and the shopkeeper had grabbed at her genitals through her clothes. In spite of this first experience she had gone to the shop a second time, after which she stopped away. Afterwards she reproached herself for having gone a second time [...] And in fact a ’bad conscience’ by which she was oppressed could be traced back to this experience.” Her &quot;eager collaboration in her analysis gave Freud much precious material...contributed substantial changes and fundamental new elements to his theories: the wish theory of psychosis and dream; the transferential reconstruction of her early pleasures...fantastic scenes from her inner life.&quot; In particular, Freud&#x27;s theory of deferred action owed much to &quot;Emma Eckstein&#x27;s twinned scenes in shops...&#x27;Now this case is typical of repression in hysteria. We invariably find that a memory has been repressed which has only become a trauma through &quot;deferred action&quot;&#x27;.&quot;

==Surgery==

Freud was at the time under the influence of his friend and collaborator Wilhelm Fliess, an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Fliess, whom Freud had called &quot;the Kepler of biology&quot;, had developed theories today considered pseudoscientific, including the belief that sexual problems were linked to the nose by a supposed nasogenital connection. Fliess had been treating &quot;nasal reflex neurosis&quot; by cauterizing the inside of the nose under local anesthesia. Fliess conjectured that if temporary cauterization was useful, surgery would yield more permanent results. He began operating on the noses of patients he diagnosed with the disorder, including Eckstein and Freud.

His surgery proved disastrous, resulting in profuse, recurrent nasal bleeding; Fliess had left a half-metre of gauze in Eckstein&#x27;s nasal cavity, the subsequent removal of which left her permanently disfigured. Though aware of Fliess&#x27;s culpability, Freud fled from the remedial surgery in horror, he could only bring himself to delicately intimate in his correspondence to Fliess the nature of his disastrous role and in subsequent letters maintained a tactful silence on the matter or else returned to the face-saving topic of Eckstein&#x27;s hysteria. Freud ultimately reasserted his full confidence in Fliess&#x27;s competence, making Eckstein responsible for the catastrophe by concluding that her post-operative haemorrhages were &quot;wish-bleedings&quot;, caused by her hysterical longing for the affection of others.

Guilt over the episode has been identified as contributing to the dream of Irma&#x27;s injection in &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;: &quot;Max Schur grasped right away the significance of the episode to the &#x27;Irma&#x27; dream...in his paper on the specimen dream.&quot;

==Seduction theory==

Eckstein is also associated with Freud&#x27;s seduction theory. In 1897, Freud cites her analytic findings to Fliess as support for his &quot;so-called seduction theory, the claim that all neuroses are the consequences of an adult&#x27;s, usually a father&#x27;s, sexual abuse of a child&quot;. Eckstein wrote that &quot;Freud deliberately treated his patient in such a manner as not to give her the slightest hint of what would emerge from the unconscious and in the process obtained from her...the identical scenes with the father&quot;.

Jeffrey Masson in his assault on Freud&#x27;s abandonment of the seduction theory makes much of Eckstein&#x27;s role, linking Freud&#x27;s &quot;abandonment&quot; of her position with respect to the Fliess surgery to his &quot;abandonment&quot; of her evidence for the paternal etiology of neurosis: for &quot;the idea – that...all neurotic patients had been sexually abused&quot;.

Yet while few (since Schur) would dissent that in regard to the failed surgery &quot;Freud&#x27;s evasiveness is blatant...Freud was eager to protect Fliess from the obvious charge of careless, almost fatal malpractice&quot;, there is at the same time much to suggest that &quot;as far as the seduction theory is concerned, Eckstein is a red herring...no more relevant than Freud&#x27;s other patients. The fact that Masson lavishes so much attention on her...[is because] Emma Eckstein is for him a woman whom Freud and Fliess abused. She is thus the prototypical psychoanalytic victim...this symbolic function&quot;.

==Cultural influences==

* In 1904, Eckstein had published a small book on the sexual education of children, although in it she does not mention Freud. A few years later, however, in his open letter on &quot;The Sexual Enlightenment of Children&quot;, Freud refers to her book approvingly, highlighting &quot;the charming letter of explanation which a certain Frau Emma Eckstein quotes as having been written by her to her son when he was about ten years old&quot;.
* Eckstein appears as a character in Joseph Skibell&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;A Curable Romantic&quot;.
* The song &quot;Emma Eckstein&#x27;s Nose Job&quot; was released as a single in 2010 by Danish musician Anders Thode.
