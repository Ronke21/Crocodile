<text>Social theories are analytical frameworks, or paradigms, that are used to study and interpret social phenomena. A tool used by social scientists, social theories relate to historical debates over the validity and reliability of different methodologies (e.g. positivism and antipositivism), the primacy of either structure or agency, as well as the relationship between contingency and necessity. Social theory in an informal nature, or authorship based outside of academic social and political science, may be referred to as &quot;social criticism&quot; or &quot;social commentary&quot;, or &quot;cultural criticism&quot; and may be associated both with formal cultural and literary scholarship, as well as other non-academic or journalistic forms of writing.

== Definitions ==
Social theory by definition is used to make distinctions and generalizations among different types of societies, and to analyze modernity as it has emerged in the past few centuries., Social theory, as it is recognized today, emerged in the 20th century as a distinct discipline, and was largely equated with an attitude of critical thinking and the desire for knowledge through &quot;a posteriori&quot; methods of discovery, rather than &quot;a priori&quot; methods of tradition.

Social thought provides general theories to explain actions and behavior of society as a whole, encompassing sociological, political, and philosophical ideas. Classical social theory has generally been presented from a perspective of Western philosophy, and often regarded as Eurocentric.

Theory construction, according to The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology, is instrumental:
&quot;Their goal is to promote accurate communication, rigorous testing, high accuracy, and broad applicability. They include the following: absence of contradictions, absence of ambivalence, abstractness, generality, precision, parsimony, and conditionality.&quot; Therefore, a social theory consists of well-defined terms, statements, arguments and scope conditions.

==History==

===Ancient===
Confucius (551–479 BCE) envisaged a just society that went beyond his contemporary society of the Warring States. Later on, also in China, Mozi (&quot;circa&quot; 470 – &quot;circa&quot; 390 BCE) recommended a more pragmatic sociology, but ethical at base.

In the West, Saint Augustine (354–430) was concerned exclusively with the idea of the &quot;just society&quot;. St. Augustine describes late Ancient Roman society through a lens of hatred and contempt for what he saw as false Gods, and in reaction theorized City of God. Ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle (384–322 BC) and Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC), did not see a distinction between politics and society. The concept of society did not come until the Enlightenment period. The term, &quot;société&quot;, was probably first used as key concept by Rousseau in discussion of social relations. Prior to the enlightenment, social theory took largely narrative and normative form. It was expressed as stories and fables, and it may be assumed the pre-Socratic philosophers and religious teachers were the precursors to social theory proper.

===Medieval===
There is evidence of early Muslim sociology from the 14th century: in Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; (later translated as &quot;Prolegomena&quot; in Latin), the introduction to a seven volume analysis of universal history, was the first to advance social philosophy and social science in formulating theories of social cohesion and social conflict. Ibn Khaldun is thus considered by many to be the forerunner of sociology. Khaldun&#x27;s treatise described in &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; &quot;(Introduction to History)&quot;, published in 1377, two types of societies: (1) the city or town-dweller and (2) the mobile, nomadic societies.

=== European social thought ===
Modernity arose during the Enlightenment period, with the emergence of the world economy and exchange among diverse societies, bringing sweeping changes and new challenges for society. Many French and Scottish intellectuals and philosophers embraced the idea of progress and ideas of modernity.

The Enlightenment period was marked by the idea that with new discoveries challenging the traditional way of thinking, scientists were required to find new normativity. This process allowed scientific knowledge and society to progress. French thought during this period focused on moral critique and criticisms of the monarchy. These ideas did not draw on ideas of the past from classical thinkers, nor involved following religious teachings and authority of the monarch.

A common factor among the classical theories was the agreement that the history of humanity is pursuing a fixed path. They differed on where that path would lead: social progress, technological progress, decline or even fall. Social cycle theorists were skeptical of the Western achievements and technological progress, but argued that progress is an illusion of the ups and downs of the historical cycles. The classical approach has been criticized by many modern sociologists and theorists; among them Karl Popper, Robert Nisbet, Charles Tilly and Immanuel Wallerstein.

The 19th century brought questions involving social order. The French Revolution freed French society of control by the monarchy, with no effective means of maintaining social order until Napoleon came to power. Three great classical theories of social and historical change emerged: the social evolutionism theory (of which Social Darwinism forms a part), the social cycle theory, and the Marxist historical materialism theory.

19th-century classical social theory has been expanded upon to create newer, contemporary social theories such as multilineal theories of evolution (neoevolutionism, sociobiology, theory of modernization, theory of post-industrial society) and various strains of Neo-Marxism.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social theory became closely related to academic sociology, and other related studies such as anthropology, philosophy, and social work branched out into their own disciplines. Subjects like &quot;philosophy of history&quot; and other multi-disciplinary subject matter became part of social theory as taught under sociology.

A revival of discussion free of disciplines began in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The Frankfurt Institute for Social Research is a historical example. The Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago followed in the 1940s. In the 1970s, programs in Social and Political Thought were established at Sussex and York. Others followed, with emphases and structures, such as Social Theory and History (University of California, Davis). Cultural Studies programs extended the concerns of social theory into the domain of culture and thus anthropology. A chair and undergraduate program in social theory was established at the University of Melbourne. Social theory at present seems to be gaining acceptance as a classical academic discipline.

==== Classical social theory ====

Adam Ferguson, Montesquieu, and John Millar, among others, were the first to study society as distinct from political institutions and processes. In the nineteenth century, the scientific method was introduced into study of society, which was a significant advance leading to development of sociology as a discipline.

In the 18th century, the pre-classical period of social theories developed a new form that provides the basic ideas for social theory, such as evolution, philosophy of history, social life and social contract, public and general will, competition in social space, organismic pattern for social description. Montesquieu, in &quot;The Spirit of Laws&quot;, which established that social elements influence human nature, was possibly the first to suggest a universal explanation for history. Montesquieu included changes in mores and manners as part of his explanation of political and historic events.

Philosophers, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and Denis Diderot, developed new social ideas during the Enlightenment period that were based on reason and methods of scientific inquiry. Jean-Jacques Rousseau in this time played a significant role in social theory. He revealed the origin of inequality, analyzed the social contract (and social compact) that forms social integration and defined the social sphere or civil society. Jean-Jacques Rousseau also emphasized that man has the liberty to change his world, an assertion that made it possible to program and change society.

Adam Smith addressed the question of whether vast inequalities of wealth represented progress. He explained that the wealthy often demand convenience, employing numerous others to carry out labor to meet their demands. Smith argued that this allows wealth to be redistributed among inhabitants, and for all to share in progress of society. Smith explained that social forces could regulate the market economy with social objectivity and without need for government intervention. Smith regarded the division of labor as an important factor for economic progress. John Millar suggested that improved status of women was important for progress of society. Millar also advocated for abolition of slavery, suggesting that personal liberty makes people more industrious, ambitious, and productive.

The first &quot;modern&quot; social theories (known as classical theories) that begin to resemble the analytic social theory of today developed simultaneously with the birth of the science of sociology. Auguste Comte (1798–1857), known as the &quot;father of sociology&quot; and regarded by some as the first philosopher of science, laid the groundwork for positivism – as well as structural functionalism and social evolutionism. Karl Marx rejected Comtean positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a &quot;science of society&quot; based on historical materialism, becoming recognised as a founding figure of sociology posthumously. At the turn of the 20th century, the first of German sociologists, including Max Weber and Georg Simmel, developed sociological antipositivism. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social scientific thought in particular; Durkheimian sociological positivism and structural functionalism, Marxist historical materialism and conflict theory, and Weberian antipositivism and verstehen critique.

Another early modern theorist, Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), coined the term &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) and Pitirim A. Sorokin argued that &quot;history goes in cycles,&quot; and presented the social cycle theory to illustrate their point. Ferdinand Tönnies (1855–1936) made &quot;community&quot; and &quot;society&quot; (&quot;Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft&quot;, 1887) the special topics of the new science of &quot;sociology&quot;, both of them based on different modes of will of social actors.

The 19th century pioneers of social theory and sociology, like Saint-Simon, Comte, Marx, John Stuart Mill or Spencer, never held university posts and they were broadly regarded as philosophers. Emile Durkheim endeavoured to formally established academic sociology, and did so at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, he published &quot;Rules of the Sociological Method&quot;. In 1896, he established the journal &quot;L&#x27;Année Sociologique&quot;. Durkheim&#x27;s seminal monograph, &quot;Suicide&quot; (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst Catholic and Protestant populations, distinguished sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy.

====Post-modern social theory====

The term &quot;postmodernism&quot; was brought into social theory in 1971 by the Arab American Theorist Ihab Hassan in his book: &quot;The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature&quot;. In 1979 Jean-François Lyotard wrote a short but influential work &quot;The Postmodern Condition: A report on knowledge&quot;. Jean Baudrillard, Michel Foucault, and Roland Barthes were influential in the 1970s in developing postmodern theory.

Scholars most commonly hold &quot;postmodernism&quot; to be a movement of ideas arising from, but also critical of elements of modernism. The wide range of uses of this term resulted in different elements of modernity are chosen as being continuous. Each of the different uses is rooted in some argument about the nature of knowledge, known in philosophy as epistemology. Individuals who use the term are arguing that either there is something fundamentally different about the transmission of meaning, or that modernism has fundamental flaws in its system of knowledge. 

The argument for the necessity of the term states that economic and technological conditions of our age have given rise to a decentralized, media-dominated society. These ideas are simulacra, and only inter-referential representations and copies of each other, with no real original, stable or objective source for communication and meaning. Globalization, brought on by innovations in communication, manufacturing and transportation, is cited as one force which has decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society, lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication, or intellectual production. The postmodern view is that inter-subjective knowledge, and not objective knowledge, is the dominant form of discourse. The ubiquity of copies and dissemination alters the relationship between reader and what is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.

Not all people who use the term postmodern or postmodernism see these developments as positive. Users of the term argue that their ideals have arisen as the result of particular economic and social conditions, including &quot;late capitalism&quot;, the growth of broadcast media, and that such conditions have pushed society into a new historical period.

====Today====
In the past few decades, in response to postmodern critiques, social theory has begun to stress free will, individual choice, subjective reasoning, and the importance of unpredictable events in place of deterministic necessity. Rational choice theory, symbolic interactionism, false necessity are examples of more recent developments. A view among contemporary sociologists is that there are no great unifying &#x27;laws of history&#x27;, but rather smaller, more specific, and more complex laws that govern society.

Philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger recently attempted to revise classical social theory by exploring how things fit together, rather than to provide an all encompassing single explanation of a universal reality. He begins by recognizing the key insight of classical social theory of society as an artifact, and then by discarding the law-like characteristics forcibly attached to it. Unger argues that classical social theory was born proclaiming that society is made and imagined, and not the expression of an underlying natural order, but at the same time its capacity was checked by the equally prevalent ambition to create law-like explanations of history and social development. The human sciences that developed claimed to identify a small number of possible types of social organization that coexisted or succeeded one another through inescapable developmental tendencies or deep-seated economic organization or psychological constraints. Marxism is the star example.

Unger, calling his efforts &quot;super-theory&quot;, has thus sought to develop a comprehensive view of history and society. Unger does so without subsuming deep structure analysis under an indivisible and repeatable type of social organization or with recourse to law-like constraints and tendencies. His articulation of such a theory is in &quot;False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy&quot;, where he uses deep-logic practice to theorize human social activity through anti-necessitarian analysis.

Unger begins by formulating the theory of false necessity, which claims that social worlds are the artifact of human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that societies must adhere to, and there is no necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. We are free to choose and to create the forms and the paths that our societies will take. However, this does not give license to absolute contingency. Unger finds that there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring about certain institutional forms—liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, which Unger calls formative context. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and anti-necessitarian social thought, Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and empowerment make change possible. Unger calls this empowerment negative capability. However, Unger adds that these outcomes are always reliant on the forms from which they spring. The new world is built upon the existing one.

==Schools of thought==

===Chicago school===

The Chicago school developed in the 1920s, through the work of Albion Woodbury Small, W. I. Thomas, Ernest W. Burgess, Robert E. Park, Ellsworth Faris, George Herbert Mead, and other sociologists at the University of Chicago. The Chicago school focused on patterns and arrangement of social phenomenon across time and place, and within context of other social variables.

===Critical theory===

Critical theorists focus on reflective assessment and critique of society and culture in order to reveal and challenge power structures and their relations and influences on social groups.

===Marxism===

Karl Marx wrote and theorized about the importance of political economy on society, and focused on the &quot;material conditions&quot; of life. His theories centered around capitalism and its effect on class-struggle between the proletariat and bourgeoisie.

===Postmodernism===

Postmodernism was defined by Jean-François Lyotard as &quot;incredulity towards metanarratives&quot; and contrasted that with modern which he described as &quot;any science that legitimates itself with reference to a metadiscourse... making an explicit appeal to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit the hermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working subject, or the creation of wealth.&quot;

===Other perspectives===
Other theories include:
* Social constructionist theory
* Rational choice theory
* Structural functionalism – influenced by Spencer and Durkheim
* Social action – influenced by Weber and Pareto
* Conflict theory – influenced by Marx, Simmel
* Symbolic interaction – influenced by George Herbert Mead
* False necessity
* Agential realism

==Key thinkers==
===French social thought===
Some known French social thinkers are Claude Henri Saint-Simon, Auguste Comte, Émile Durkheim, and Michel Foucault.

===British social thought===
British social thought, with thinkers such as Herbert Spencer, addressed questions and ideas relating to political economy and social evolution. The political ideals of John Ruskin were a precursor of social economy (&quot;Unto This Last&quot; had a very important impact on Gandhi&#x27;s philosophy).

===German social thought===
Important German philosophers and social thinkers included Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse and Niklas Luhmann.

===Chinese social thought===
Important Chinese philosophers and social thinkers included Shang Yang, Lao Zi, Confucius, Mencius, Wang Chong, Wang Yangming, Li Zhi, Zhu Xi, Gu Yanwu, Gong Zizhen, Wei Yuan, Kang Youwei, Lu Xun, Mao Zedong, Zhu Ming.

===Italian sociology===
Important Italian social scientists include Antonio Gramsci, Gaetano Mosca, Vilfredo Pareto, Franco Ferrarotti.

===Thai social thought===
Important Thai social theorists include Jit Phumisak, Kukrit Pramoj, and Prawase Wasi

==In academic practices==
Social theory seeks to question why humans inhabit the world the way they do, and how that came to be by looking at power relations, social structures, and social norms, while also examining how humans relate to each other and the society they find themselves in, how this has changed over time and in different cultures, and the tools used to measure those things. Social theory looks to interdisciplinarity, combining knowledge from multiple academic disciplines in order to enlighten these complex issues, and can draw on ideas from fields as diverse as anthropology and media studies.

Social theory guides scientific inquiry by promoting scientists to think about which topics are suitable for investigation and how they should measure them. Selecting or creating appropriate theory for use in examining an issue is an important skill for any researcher. Important distinctions: a &quot;theoretical orientation&quot; (or paradigm) is a worldview, the lens through which one organizes experience (i.e. thinking of human interaction in terms of power or exchange). A &quot;theory&quot; is an attempt to explain and predict behavior in particular contexts. A theoretical orientation cannot be proven or disproven; a theory can.

Having a theoretical orientation that sees the world in terms of power and control, one could create a theory about violent human behavior which includes specific causal statements (e.g. being the victim of physical abuse leads to psychological problems). This could lead to a hypothesis (prediction) about what one expects to see in a particular sample, e.g. &quot;a battered child will grow up to be shy or violent&quot;. One can then test the hypothesis by looking to see if it is consistent with data. One might, for instance, review hospital records to find children who were abused, then track them down and administer a personality test to see if they show signs of being violent or shy. The selection of an appropriate (i.e. useful) theoretical orientation within which to develop a potentially helpful theory is the bedrock of social science.

=== Example of questions posed by social theorists ===
Philosophical questions addressed by social thinkers often centered around modernity, including:
* Can human reason make sense of the social world and shape it for the better?
* Did the development of modern societies, with vast inequalities in wealth among citizens, constitute progress?
* How do particular government interventions and regulations impact natural social processes?
* Should the economy/market be regulated or not?
Other issues relating to modernity that were addressed by social thinkers include social atomization, alienation, loneliness, social disorganization, and secularization.

<text>Canton of Obwalden or Obwald ( ; ; ; ) is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of seven municipalities and the seat of the government and parliament is in Sarnen. It is traditionally considered a &quot;half-canton&quot;, the other half being Nidwalden.

Obwalden lies in Central Switzerland and contains the geographical centre of Switzerland. It is bordered by the canton of Lucerne to the north, the canton of Nidwalden and Uri to the east and the canton of Bern to the south. The canton is essentially in the valley of the Sarner Aa south of Lake Lucerne, with an exclave around Engelberg.

It is one of the smallest cantons. The largest town is Sarnen, followed by Kerns and Alpnach.

Together with Nidwalden, Obwalden was part of the forest canton of Unterwalden, one of the three participants in the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy, named in the Pact of Brunnen of 1315 with Uri and Schwyz. The division of Unterwalden into two separate territories, Nidwalden and Obwalden, appears to develop over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries.

==History==

Obwalden is one of the two valleys, along with Nidwalden, that make up Unterwalden. Throughout its history, the political situation and the extent of its independence have varied widely. Between 1291 and 1309, Unterwalden joined the nascent Swiss Confederation. During that time Obwalden was known as &quot;Unterwalden ob dem Kernwald&quot; and Nidwalden was &quot;Unterwalden nit dem Kernwald&quot;. Unterwalden&#x27;s votes in the Tagsatzung were split between the two valleys. Between 1798 and 1803 it became the District of Sarnen in the Canton of Waldstätten. From 1803 until 1999 it was the half-canton of Obwalden. In 1999, the new Federal Constitution eliminated the half-canton designation and made Obwalden a full canton, though they still shared representation in the Council of States and only had half a vote. Due to the complex history of Obwalden there will be some overlap between the histories of Obwalden, Nidwalden, and Unterwalden.

===Prehistory===
The earliest archaeological traces in Obwalden is a stone knife from the 8th millennium BC, which was found in Brand by Lungern. Two Horgen culture sites from the 4th millennium BC have been found in the Canton. An ax and two bone blades were found in Giswil and a hammer-ax was found in Wilen. It appears that the valleys in Obwalden were at least temporarily inhabited during this time, but no evidence of agriculture or permanent settlements have been found.

An Early Bronze Age grave in Foribach in Kerns implies that there was a settlement in the surrounding area between 2000 BC and 1700 BC. There may have also been a settlement along the shores of Lake Sarnen during the same period. Between 1500 and 1100 BC there were several other settlements, including houses in the Rengg Pass and high alpine herding camps above the pass. Many of the place names in the canton have Celtic or Gallo-Roman roots.

In 1914-15 a Roman estate was unearthed in Alpnach. The estate was built in the late 1st century AD and remained in operation until a fire destroyed the main building in 270.

Around 700, the Alamanni began to migrate into Obwalden. They initially settled around the lakes while the Gallo-Romans lived up on the plateau. The Alamanni influence is noticeable around Lake Sarnen and the Kerns plateau where many place name end in -ingen, -wil and -hofen. The Gallo-Romans remained around Mt. Pilatus, the Giswilerstock and in the Melch valley. During the 8th to 11th centuries, the two populations intermarried and eventually all became Germanized. By the 9th century it was part of the Second Kingdom of Burgundy. It became part of the Holy Roman Empire following the winter military campaign of 1032-33 by Emperor Conrad II. Obwalden was given to the Counts of Lenzburg from Aargau. The counts built a castle on Landenberg hill to help them control the land.

===Early middle ages===

During the Early Middle Ages, much of the land in Obwalden was controlled by monasteries (especially Murbach-Lucerne and Beromünster Abbey). The monasteries began to spread their authority and parishes into Obwalden during this time. St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Sarnen was first mentioned in 1036, but was built on top of an 8th-century church. St. Mary&#x27;s Church of Alpnach was probably built in the 8th or 9th century. The churches in Kerns, Sachseln, and Giswil all became parish churches by the 12th century and a church was mentioned in Lungern in 1275. During the 14th century, Engelberg Abbey began to acquire rights over the parishes in Obwalden. By 1415 the Abbey had de facto control over the appointment of parish priests in the entire valley. In 1460, this became de jure authority over all the parishes in the valley.

In the early 12th century the Counts of Lenzburg granted a large part of their lands in Obwalden to their monastery at Beromünster. In 1210 the Lenzburg castle at Landenberg was abandoned. However, in the 13th century, several small castles were built for the minor nobles. The Kellner of Sarnen (Obedientiaries of the main family) lived in the Lower Castle in Sarnen. In Giswil the Lords of Hunwil lived in Hunwil Castle while the Meier of Giswil, a Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family, lived in Rosenberg Castle. In Lungern, the Lords of Vittringen had a castle.

The political community of Sarnen (de Sarnon locorum homines) were first mentioned in a Papal bull in 1247, when they and the citizens of Schwyz were excommunicated for supporting Frederick II against their ruler, Rudolf of Habsburg-Laufenburg. In 1257, the Habsburgs had to grant their landlord rights in Obwalden to several of their vassals, all minor nobles. During the 13th century, Obwalden was home to a unified local political organization with enough autonomy to act against the best interests of their nominal rulers. The nobility in the canton were all minor nobles with limited power. This changed on 16 April 1291 when Rudolph I of Habsburg bought the Unterwalden (containing both Obwalden and Nidwalden) from Murbach Abbey. This made him the chief landowner, the count, and the emperor over the valley. Fearing a loss of their freedoms, on the 1 August 1291 Nidwalden (Obwalden is not named in the text of the document, though it is named on the seal appended to it) formed the Eternal Alliance with Uri and Schwyz. This alliance is considered the beginning of the Swiss Confederation and modern Switzerland.

===The Old Swiss Confederation===
Initially, the Eternal Alliance was a mutual defense pact between the three cantons, each of which was independently ruled. In 1304 the two valleys of Obwalden and Nidwalden were joined together under the same local deputy of the count. In 1309 Emperor Henry VII confirmed to Unterwalden all the liberties granted by his predecessor, though the exact terms are unknown. The Emperor also granted the valleys imperial immediacy which placed Unterwalden on an equal political footing with Uri and Schwyz.

In 1314, Duke Louis IV of Bavaria (who would become Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor) and Frederick the Handsome, a Habsburg prince, each claimed the crown of the Holy Roman Emperor. The Confederates supported Louis IV because they feared the Habsburgs would annex their countries as Habsburg property. War broke out over a dispute between the Confederates of Schwyz and the Habsburg-protected monastery of Einsiedeln regarding some pastures, and eventually, the Confederates of Schwyz conducted a raid on the monastery.

In support of their allies, Unterwalden joined the Confederates in the Battle of Morgarten and drove back an invasion of the Brünig Pass. After the decisive Confederation victory over the Habsburgs, Unterwalden renewed the Eternal Alliance in the Pact of Brunnen. During the 14th century, the communities in Obwalden grew increasingly powerful at the expense of the nobility. The formerly powerful Kellner of Sarnen family retired from politics after 1307. The White Book of Sarnen mentions the conquest of the Lower Castle in Sarnen, the home of the family, which may explain why they left politics. The Strättligen and Ringgenberg families married into the Lords of Hunwil and used the power of the dynastic marriages to reduce Habsburg power to a vague suzerainty in the 1330s and 40s, though the Habsburg still owned some land in Obwalden. During the early 14th century, an organization of livestock farmers developed in the Hunwil lands. Throughout the century, their political power grew as they acquired more land and grew wealthy. The organization eventually became an alternative political structure and following conflicts between the organization and the Hunwil nobles, in 1382 the Landsgemeinde excluded the Hunwils from holding political or court offices. During the 13th and 14th century Obwalden established its own local governance, despite having had a joint assembly with Nidwalden up to around 1330.

During the 14th century, Obwalden participated in several other wars with the Swiss Confederation, including the Battle of Sempach in 1386 and the Gugler war in 1375. It peacefully acquired Alpnach in 1368 and Hergiswil in 1378. In 1403 Obwalden joined Uri to invade the Leventina area (today located in the canton of Ticino) to establish new markets for cheese and cattle. They conquered the Val d&#x27; Ossola in 1410. In 1419 the Confederation bought Bellinzona. Milan attacked the city three years later in 1422 after an offer to buy Bellinzona was rejected by the Swiss Confederation. The troops from Uri and Obwalden were quickly driven from the city and later defeated at the Battle of Arbedo on 30 June 1422. This defeat drove the Confederates out of Bellinzona and the Val d&#x27; Ossola and Leventina. An attempt to pull the Entlebuch region away from Lucerne ended with the Obwalden supported Entlebuch leader Peter Amstalden arrested, tried and executed in 1478. In 1500, Nidwalden, Schwyz, and Uri conquered Ticino again and ruled until 1798. While Obwalden participated in the conquests of Aargau (1415), Thurgau (1460), and Locarno, (1512), and in the temporary occupation of the Val d&#x27; Ossola (1410–14, 1416–22, 1425–26, 1512–15) it was never able to incorporate any captured territory or grow.

During the Burgundian Wars (1474–77) Unterwalden, like the other Forest cantons, hung back through jealousy of Bern, but came to the rescue in time of need. Following the Swiss victories in the Burgundian Wars the Old Swiss Confederation was nearly torn apart by internal conflict when the city cantons insisted on having the lion&#x27;s share of the proceeds since they had supplied the most troops. The country cantons resented this and the &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; or leadership of each of the cantons met in Stans in Nidwalden in 1481 to resolve the issues. However, they were unable to resolve the issues and war seemed inevitable. A local hermit, Niklaus von der Flüe from Obwalden, was consulted on the situation. According to legend he requested that a message be passed on to the members of the &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; on his behalf. The details of the message have remained unknown to this day, however, it did calm the tempers and led to the drawing up of the &quot;Stanser Verkommnis&quot;. As part of the &quot;Verkommnis&quot; Fribourg and Solothurn were admitted into the confederation.

===The Reformation===
The Landsgemeinde of Obwalden stood firmly against the Protestant Reformation. When attempts to resolve the conflicts between the Protestant and Catholic cantons in the Tagsatzung and during the disputation of Baden (1526) were unsuccessful, Obwalden adopted an aggressively pro-Catholic stance. In 1528, they sent troops over the Brünig Pass to try to force the Bernese Oberhasli region to hold the old faith. The Obwalden invasion and the Bernese response, which drove them out of Bern, were part of the general unrest leading to the First War of Kappel in 1529. While the First War of Kappel ended in a peace treaty without loss of life, two years later the Second War of Kappel ended in the death of reformer Huldrych Zwingli and a victory for the Catholic side. However, since about half of the Confederation remained Protestant, the Catholic cantons began to make alliances with neighboring Catholic leaders including France and Spain. Most of the leading political families in Obwalden became pro-French.

===Under the Helvetic Republic===

During the 1798 French invasion, Obwalden still had a strongly pro-French government. The von Flüe had grown wealthy and politically powerful in mercenary service in France. The clergy saw France still as supporters of the Catholic Church . On 1 April 1798, Obwalden became the first of the original Swiss cantons to accept the Helvetic Republic. However, it was then forced by its neighbors to reject the new Republic and resist the French. When the French armies crushed the rebellion, the old Forest Cantons were merged into the single Canton of Waldstätten. Obwalden became the district of Sarnen in this new Canton. The leadership of the new district were supporters of Helvetic Republic and the French army.

After the collapse of the Helvetic Republic, the Act of Mediation of 1803 dissolved Waldstätten and in the 15th section specifically divided Unterwalden into the half-cantons &quot;ob dem Wald&quot; and &quot;nid dem Wald&quot;. The leading &quot;Helvetiker&quot; or supporters of the Republic lost the favor of their fellow citizens. However, a large portion of the councilors before 1798 were also civil servants under the Republic and were re-elected by the Landsgemeinde in 1803. While the politicians remained the same, there were several important changes in the half-canton. The major change was that every resident of the canton gained equal rights, where before there had been citizens and resident aliens each with different rights. Other changes included raising the voting age from 14 to 20 and requiring military service at age 20.

===From the Helvetic Republic to the founding of the Federal State===
In 1815 the monastery of Engelberg and the municipality of the same name joined Obwalden. The cantonal constitution documents of 19 and 24 November 1815 partially guaranteed the traditional rights of the Abbey and its surrounding community. Then, in 1816, the constitution was altered to include Engelberg as a municipality in the canton. During the Restoration period the government began to roll back many of the reforms of the Helvetic Republic. In the 1830s and 40s, Landammann Nikodem Spichtig began to expand the power of his office. In 1840, a coalition of liberals and radicals gained the majority in the Federal Diet. They introduced a number of reforms and proposed a new constitution that included many radical reforms. In response to this radical government, the Catholic and conservative cantons, including Obwalden, formed the &quot;Sonderbund&quot; or separate alliance in 1843. When the radicals attempted to dissolve this separate alliance in 1847, they started the Sonderbund War. Though Obwalden participated in the War, the Sonderbund council surrendered before the Federal army reached the Canton.

After the Sonderbund War, the old government was replaced with a liberal government. In response to the wide-ranging powers that Landammann Spichtig had held, the new government eliminated some levels of government and replaced lifetime appointments to Landammann with term limits. Spichtig was seen as having pulled Obwalden into the Sonderbund, and he was driven out of office and politics.

===Modern Obwalden===

In 1850, the Catholic Church was recognized as the only cantonal religion. However, in 1867 the cantonal constitution was completely rewritten. It changed the organization of the government and allowed the Reformed churches some rights, including the right to run their own schools. The 1867 constitution also weakened many of the special privileges that the Landmann held. In 1902 the constitution was rewritten again and it allowed citizens to demand a referendum on any law. In the following years a number of initiatives and referendums were submitted, some of which succeeded. In 1909, an initiative was approved which allowed 1,200 citizens to demand a secret vote on constitutional revisions. In 1922, the power of the Landsgemeinde was weakened further with the introduction of secret ballots on constitutional, legal and tax laws.

The last complete revision of the cantonal constitution was in 1968. This revision addressed a number of small issues and clarified a number of laws, but there were no major changes. In 1972, women were first allowed to vote in cantonal elections and in 1983 the voting age dropped to eighteen. The Landsgemeinde was finally abolished in 1998.

==Municipalities==


There are seven municipalities: Sarnen, Kerns, Sachseln, Alpnach, Giswil, Lungern and Engelberg. The capital Sarnen is subdivided into &quot;Sarnen-Dorfschaft&quot;, &quot;Kägiswil&quot;, &quot;Schwendi/Wilen&quot; and &quot;Ramersberg&quot;. The autonomy of the municipalities in Obwalden is significant. Two thirds of the tax revenue flows to the municipalities, which for example pay for education without grants from the canton.

==Economy==
Small and middle-sized businesses dominate the economy of Obwalden. Many of them are specialists in areas such as miniature engines, synthetics, medical equipment, or nanotechnology.

<doc id="317638" wikidata="Q2576201" url="?curid=317638" title="Texas Hill Country">
<text>The Texas Hill Country is a geographic region of Central and South Texas, forming the southeast part of the Edwards Plateau. Given its location, climate, terrain, and vegetation, the Hill Country can be considered the border between the American South and Southwest. The region represents the very remote rural countryside of Central Texas, but also is home to growing suburban neighborhoods and affluent retirement communities.

The region is notable for its karst topography and tall rugged hills of limestone or granite. Many of the hills rise to a height of above the surrounding plains and valleys, with Packsaddle Mountain rising to a height of above the Llano River in Kingsland. The Hill Country also includes the Llano Uplift and the second-largest granite dome in the United States, Enchanted Rock. The terrain throughout the region is characterized by a thin layer of topsoil and many exposed rocks and boulders, making the region very dry and prone to flash flooding. Native vegetation in the region includes various yucca, prickly pear cactus, desert spoon, and wildflowers in the Llano Uplift. The predominant trees in the region are Ashe juniper and Texas live oak.

Bound on the east by the Balcones Escarpment, the Hill Country reaches into the far northern portions of San Antonio and western portions of Travis County including the cities of Austin and Lago Vista. As a result of springs discharging water stored in the Edwards Aquifer, several cities such as Austin, San Marcos, and New Braunfels were settled at the base of the Balcones Escarpment. , the region&#x27;s economy was one of the fastest growing in the United States.

==Counties==
According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, these 26 counties are included in the Hill Country Wildlife District: 

* Bandera
* Bell
* Blanco
* Burnet
* Comal
* Coryell
* Crockett
* Edwards
* Gillespie
* Hamilton
* Hays
* Kendall
* Kerr
* Kimble
* Lampasas
* Llano
* Mason
* McCulloch
* Menard
* Real
* San Saba
* Schleicher
* Sutton
* Travis
* Val Verde
* Williamson
==History and politics==
During the American Civil War, due to its large, pro-Union, German immigrant population, the Texas Hill Country was opposed to Texas seceding from the Union. Subsequently, in the three quarters of a century following Reconstruction, the core of the Hill Country generally provided the solitary support base for the Republican Party in what became a one-party Democratic state.

Even when no Republicans were in the Texas Legislature during the 1930s and 1940s, Gillespie and Kendall Counties backed every Republican presidential nominee barring Herbert Hoover’s failed 1932 re-election campaign, and Republicans continued to control local government. Guadalupe and Comal Counties were less Republican, but still did not vote for Democratic nominees outside the 1912, 1932, 1936, and 1964 landslides. The region was also the only one in antebellum slave states to back the insurgent candidacy of Robert La Follette in 1924; in fact, Comal was La Follette’s top county in the nation with 73.96% of the vote, and Gillespie and Comal were the only counties south of the Mason–Dixon line to give a plurality to his “Progressive” ticket.

==Geography==
Because of its karst topography, the area also features a number of caverns, such as Inner Space Caverns, Natural Bridge Caverns, Bracken Cave, Longhorn Cavern State Park, Cascade Caverns, Caverns of Sonora and Cave Without a Name. The deeper caverns of the area form several aquifers, which serve as a source of drinking water for its residents. Wonder Cave in San Marcos was formed by an earthquake along the Balcones Fault. From east to west, Texas Hill Country is where the Southern United States ends and the Southwestern United States begins.

Several tributaries of the Colorado River in Texas—including the Llano and Pedernales Rivers, which cross the region west to east and join the Colorado as it cuts across the region to the southeast—drain a large portion of the Hill Country. The Guadalupe, San Antonio, Frio, Medina, and Nueces Rivers originate in the Hill Country.

This region is a dividing line for certain species occurrence. For example, the California fan palm (&quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;) is the only species of palm tree that is native to the continental United States west of the Hill Country&#x27;s Balcones Fault.

==Culture==
The area experiences a fusion of English, Spanish, and German influences in food, beer, architecture, and music that form a distinctively Texan culture separate from the state&#x27;s Southern and Southwestern influences. For example, the accordion was popularized in Tejano music in the 19th century due to cultural exposure to German settlers.

Devil&#x27;s Backbone is an elevated, winding stretch of Ranch to Market Road 12 between San Marcos and Wimberley, then Ranch to Market Road 32 continuing through to Blanco. It has long been the subject of ghost stories. Folklore about it appeared in a 1996 episode of NBC&#x27;s Robert Stack anthology series &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, featuring apparitional Spanish monks, Comanche, and Lipan Apache tribes, Confederate soldiers on their horses, and a spirit of a wolf.

The region has emerged as the center of the Texas wine industry. Three American Viticultural Areas are located in the areas: Texas Hill Country AVA, Fredericksburg in the Texas Hill Country AVA, and Bell Mountain AVA.

<doc id="317645" wikidata="Q3406090" url="?curid=317645" title="State-sponsored terrorism">
<text>State-sponsored terrorism is terrorist violence carried out with the active support of national governments provided to violent non-state actors. States can sponsor terrorist groups in several ways, including but not limited to funding terrorist organizations, providing training, supplying weapons, providing other logistical and intelligence assistance, and hosting groups within their borders. Because of the pejorative nature of the word, the identification of particular examples are often subject to political dispute and different definitions of terrorism.

A wide variety of states in both developed and developing areas of the world have engaged in sponsoring terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, state sponsorship of terrorism was a frequent feature of international conflict. From that time to the 2010s there was a steady pattern of decline in the prevalence and magnitude of state support. Nevertheless, because of the increasing consequent level of violence that it could potentially facilitate, it remains an issue of highly salient international concern.

==Definition==
There are at least 250 definitions of &quot;terrorism&quot; available in academic literature and government and intergovernmental sources, several of which include mention of state sponsorship. In a review of primary documents on international law governing armed conflict, Reisman and Antoniou identify that: The Gilmore Commission of the U.S. Congress gave the following definition of state-sponsored terrorism: 

The U.S. Government, which has repeatedly engaged in sponsorship of terrorism as a feature of its foreign policy, provides its own definition in the U.S. State Department&#x27;s list of state sponsors of terrorism. Authorities and scholars of terrorism and conflict, such as Alex P. Schmid (former Officer-in-Charge of Terrorism Prevention at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), Daniel Byman, Richard Chasdi, and Frank Shanty, have pointed to problems in the U.S.&#x27; definition, including that it is politicized, analytically unclear, and inherently self-serving.

==Background==
The use of terrorist organizations as proxies in armed conflicts between state actors became more attractive in the mid-20th century as a result of post World War II developments like the increasing costs of traditional warfare and the risk of nuclear war. Speaking about the effect of nuclear capability on traditional military conflict KGB agent Alexander Sakharovsky said that &quot;In today&#x27;s world, when nuclear arms have made military force obsolete, terrorism should become our main weapon.&quot; Though state-sponsored terrorism persists in the post-9/11 era, some scholars have argued that it has become less significant in the age of global jihadism. On the other hand, Daniel Byman believes its importance has increased. Organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are heavily dependent on state support. According to the US Counter-Terrorism Coordinator&#x27;s Office this support can include &quot;funds, weapons, materials and the secure areas&quot; that organizations use for &quot;planning and conducting operations&quot;.

The &quot;Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law&quot; notes that international legal institutions currently lack a mechanism to prosecute terrorist leaders who &quot;instruct, support or succour&quot; terrorism. At the conclusion of the Lockerbie trial, some commentators continued to harbor doubts about the legitimacy of the only conviction secured during the trial, and thus also about Libya″s involvement. The domestic trial proved to be insufficient to identify those who had given the instructions.

==By country==
===Afghanistan===

The United States and Pakistan have accused Afghanistan&#x27;s KhAD agency of being responsible for numerous terrorist attacks on Pakistani soil in the 1980s and early 1990s.

According to a report by the US Defense Department, approximately 90% of the estimated 777 acts of international terrorism committed worldwide in 1987 took place in Pakistan. By 1988, KhAD and KGB agents were able to penetrate deep inside Pakistan and carry out attacks on mujahideen sanctuaries and guerrilla bases. There was strong circumstantial evidence implicating Moscow-Kabul in the August 1988 assassination of Zia ul-Haq, as the Soviets perceived that Zia wanted to adversely affect the Geneva process. WAD/KhAD has also been suspected behind the assassination of Palestinian jihadist Abdullah Yusuf Azzam alongside his son in 1989.

Afghanistan&#x27;s KHAD was one of four secret service agencies accused of perpetrating terrorist bombings in multiple Pakistani cities including Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi during the early 1980s resulting in hundreds of civilian casualties. By the late 1980s, the US State Department blamed WAD for the perpetration of terrorist bombings in Pakistani cities. Between the late 1970s and the early 1990s, Afghanistan security agencies supported the terrorist organization called al-Zulfiqar, the group that hijacked a Pakistan International Airlines plane from Karachi to Kabul in 1981. Notable attacks include the Karachi Car bombing and an attempted car bombing on the US Consulate in Peshawar which ended up killing over 30 people in 1987. KhAD has also been accused of being behind the Hathora Murders which terrorized Karachi for 2 years in the mid 1980s.

On 24 June 2017, Pakistani army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa chaired a high-level meeting in Rawalpindi and called on Afghanistan to &quot;do more&quot; in the fight against terrorism. According to the ISPR, the attacks in Quetta and Parachinar were linked to terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan which enjoyed the &quot;patronage of Afghanistan&#x27;s National Directorate of Security (NDS)&quot;

===China===

India has accused China of supporting the Naxalites in the Naxalite–Maoist insurgency. In 2011, Indian police accused the Chinese government of providing sanctuary to the movement&#x27;s leaders, and accused Pakistani ISI of providing financial support. India has also reported of China supporting rebel groups in its Northeast states of Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram.

The Chinese government has blocked UN Security Council Sanctions Committee listing of Masood Azhar, the founder and leader of the Pakistan based terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammed as a terrorist, thwarting international efforts to disrupt the activities of his group.
Starting 2009, there have been 4 attempts to put Masood Azhar in the UN Security Council&#x27;s counter-terrorism sanctions list. All the attempts were vetoed by China, citing &#x27;lack of evidence&#x27;. China moved to protect Azhar again in October 2016 when it blocked India&#x27;s appeal to the United Nations to label him as a terrorist.
China also blocked a US move to get Azhar banned by the UN in February 2017. The most recent attempt was on 13 March 2019. However, China pulled the blockade in May 2019, finally resulting listing of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.

In mid-2020, Myanmar accused China of arming the Arakan Army, which was legally considered a terrorist organisation by the Myanmar government from 2019 to 2021. China has allegedly given the Arakan Army assault rifles, machine guns and FN-6 Chinese Manpads capable of shooting down helicopters, drones and combat aircraft.

===India===
India&#x27;s Research and Analysis Wing trained and armed the Sri Lankan Tamil group LTTE which want an independent country for Tamils of Sri Lanka, due to the continuous discrimination and violent persecution against Sri Lankan Tamils by the Sinhalese dominated Sri Lankan Government during the 1970s, but it later withdrew its support in the late 1980s when the terrorist activities of LTTE became serious and it formed alliances with separatist groups in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. From August 1983 to May 1987, India, through its intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), provided arms, training and monetary support to six Sri Lankan Tamil insurgent groups including the LTTE. During that period, 32 terror training camps were set up in India to train these 495 LTTE insurgents, including 90 women who were trained in 10 batches. The first batch of Tigers were trained in Establishment 22 based in Chakrata, Uttarakhand. The second batch, including LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman, trained in Himachal Pradesh. Prabakaran visited the first and the second batch of Tamil Tigers to see them training. Eight other batches of LTTE were trained in Tamil Nadu. Thenmozhi Rajaratnam &quot;alias&quot; Dhanu, who carried out the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and Sivarasan—the key conspirator were among the militants trained by R&amp;AW, in Nainital, India. In April 1984, the LTTE formally joined a common militant front, the Eelam National Liberation Front (ENLF), a union between LTTE, the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS), the People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) and the Eelam People&#x27;s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF). On 4 June 1987, when the Tamil Tiger-held Jaffna Peninsula was under siege by the Sri Lankan army, India provided airdrop of relief supplies to LTTE.

India has been accused by Pakistan of supporting terrorism and carrying out &quot;economic sabotage&quot;. 

In 2017, Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian naval officer arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan and charged with espionage and sabotage was sentenced to death. He was accused of operating a covert terror network within Balochistan. Jadhav had confessed that he was tasked by India’s intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), “to plan and organise espionage and sabotage activities” in Balochistan and Karachi.

In November 2020, the Foreign Office of Pakistan made public a dossier containing &#x27;irrefutable proofs&#x27; of the alleged Indian sponsorship of terrorism in Pakistan. It contained proof of India&#x27;s alleged financial and material sponsorship of multiple terrorist organisations, including UN-designated terrorist organisations Balochistan Liberation Army, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, and Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. The dossier was shared with the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres.

Pakistan has also accused Indian consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad, Afghanistan, of providing arms, training and financial aid to the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) in an attempt to destabilize Pakistan. Brahamdagh Bugti stated in a 2008 interview that he would accept help from India. Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of supporting Baloch rebels, and David Wright-Neville writes that outside Pakistan, some Western observers also believe that India secretly funds the BLA. In August 2013, US Special Representative James Dobbins said Pakistan&#x27;s fears over India&#x27;s role in Afghanistan were “not groundless&quot;. A leaked diplomatic cable sent on December 31, 2009, from the U.S. consulate in Karachi said it was &quot;plausible&quot; that Indian intelligence was helping the Baluch insurgents. An earlier 2008 cable, discussing the Mumbai attacks reported fears by British officials that &quot;intense domestic pressure would force Delhi to respond, at the minimum, by ramping up covert support to nationalist insurgents fighting the Pakistani army in Baluchistan.&quot; Another cable dating back to 2009 showed that UAE officials believed India was secretly supporting Tehrik-e-Taliban insurgents and separatists in northwest Pakistan.

===Iran===
Former United States President George W. Bush accused the Iranian government of being the &quot;world&#x27;s primary state sponsor of terror.&quot;

Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was instrumental in founding, training, and supplying Hezbollah, a group designated a &quot;Foreign Terrorist Organization&quot; by the United States Department of State, and likewise labeled a terrorist organization by Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Gulf Cooperation Council. This view is not universal, however; for example, the European Union differentiates between the political, social, and military wings of Hezbollah, designating only its military wing as a terrorist organization, while various other countries maintain relations with Hezbollah.

===Iraq===
Iraq was added to the list on December 29, 1979, but was removed in February 1982 to allow US aid to Iraq while it was fighting Iran in the Iran–Iraq War. It was re-added on September 13, 1990, following its Invasion of Kuwait.

===Israel===
The State of Israel has been accused of being a state-sponsor of terrorism, and also committing acts of state terrorism.

Several sovereign countries have at some point officially alleged that Israel is a proponent of state-sponsored terrorism, including Iran, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, and Yemen.

An early example of Israeli state-sponsored was the 1954 Lavon Affair, a botched bomb plot in Egypt that led to the resignation of the Israeli defense minister at the time. In the 1970s and 1980s, Israel was also a major supplier of arms to dictatorial regimes in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. In the 21st-century, it has been accused of sponsoring and supporting several terrorist groups as part of its proxy conflict with Iran.

===Kuwait===

Kuwait has been frequently accused of supporting terrorism financing within its borders. Kuwait has been described as the world&#x27;s biggest source of terrorism funding, particularly for ISIS and Al-Qaeda.

===Lebanon===
Lebanon was accused by United States and Israel for supporting Hezbollah.

===Libya===

After the military overthrow of King Idris in 1969 the Libyan Arab Republic (later the Great Socialist People&#x27;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), the new government supported (with weapon supplies, training camps located within Libya and monetary finances) an array of armed paramilitary groups largely left as well as some right-wing. Leftist and socialist groups included the Provisional Irish Republican Army, the Basque Fatherland and Liberty, the Umkhonto We Sizwe, the Polisario Front, the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party, the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, the Palestine Liberation Organization, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Free Aceh Movement, Free Papua Movement, Fretilin, Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front, Republic of South Maluku and the Moro National Liberation Front of the Philippines.

In 2006, Libya was removed from the United States list of terrorist supporting nations after it had ended all of its support for armed groups and the development of weapons of mass destruction.

===Malaysia===
Citing Operation Merdeka, an alleged Philippine plot to incite unrest in Sabah and reclaim the disputed territory, Malaysia funded and trained secessionists groups such as the Moro National Liberation Front in retaliation.

===North Korea===
===Pakistan===

Pakistan has been accused by India, Afghanistan, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States of involvement in Jammu and Kashmir as well as Afghanistan. Poland has also alleged that terrorists have &quot;friends in Pakistani government structures&quot;. In July 2009, the then President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari admitted that the Pakistani government had &quot;created and nurtured&quot; terrorist groups to achieve its short-term foreign policy goals in the 80’s under Zia. According to an analysis published by the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings Institution in 2008, Pakistan was the worlds &#x27;most active&#x27; state sponsor of terrorism including aiding groups which were considered a direct threat to the United States.

The Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) has stated that it was training more than 3,000 militants from various nationalities. According to some reports published by the Council of Foreign Relations, the Pakistan military and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) have provided covert support to terrorist groups active in Kashmir, including the al-Qaeda affiliate Jaish-e-Mohammed&quot;. Pakistan has denied any involvement in terrorist activities in Kashmir, arguing that it only provides political and moral support to the secessionist groups who wish to escape Indian rule. Many Kashmiri militant groups also maintain their headquarters in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is cited as further proof by the Indian government. Many of the terrorist organisations are banned by the UN, but continue to operate under different names.

The United Nations organization has publicly increased pressure on Pakistan on its inability to control its Afghanistan border and not restricting the activities of Taliban leaders who have been designated by the UN as terrorists. Many consider that Pakistan has been playing both sides in the US &quot;War on Terror&quot;.

Ahmed Rashid, a noted Pakistani journalist, has accused Pakistan&#x27;s ISI of providing help to the Taliban. Author Ted Galen Carpenter echoed that statement, stating that Pakistan &quot;... assisted rebel forces in Kashmir even though those groups have committed terrorist acts against civilians&quot; Author Gordon Thomas stated that whilst aiding in the capture of al-Qaeda members, Pakistan &quot;still sponsored terrorist groups in the disputed state of Kashmir, funding, training and arming them in their war on attrition against India.&quot; Journalist Stephen Schwartz notes that several militant and criminal groups are &quot;backed by senior officers in the Pakistani army, the country&#x27;s ISI intelligence establishment and other armed bodies of the state.&quot; According to one author, Daniel Byman, &quot;Pakistan is probably today&#x27;s most active sponsor of terrorism.&quot;

The Inter-Services Intelligence has often been accused of playing a role in major terrorist attacks across the world including the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, terrorism in Kashmir, Mumbai Train Bombings, Indian Parliament Attack, Varanasi bombings, Hyderabad bombings and 2008 Mumbai attacks. The ISI is also accused of supporting Taliban forces and recruiting and training mujahideen to fight in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Based on communication intercepts US intelligence agencies concluded Pakistan&#x27;s ISI was behind the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul on July 7, 2008, a charge that the governments of India and Afghanistan had laid previously. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has constantly reiterated allegations that militants operating training camps in Pakistan have used it as a launch platform to attack targets in Afghanistan, urged western military allies to target extremist hideouts in neighbouring Pakistan. When the United States, during the Clinton administration, targeted al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan with cruise missiles, &quot;Slate&quot; reported that two officers of the ISI were killed.

Pakistan is accused of sheltering and training the Taliban as strategic asset in operations &quot;which include soliciting funding for the Taliban, bankrolling Taliban operations, providing diplomatic support as the Taliban&#x27;s virtual emissaries abroad, arranging training for Taliban fighters, recruiting skilled and unskilled manpower to serve in Taliban armies, planning and directing offensives, providing and facilitating shipments of ammunition and fuel, and on several occasions apparently directly providing combat support,&quot; as reported by Human Rights Watch.

Pakistan was also responsible for the evacuation of about 5,000 of the top leadership of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda who were encircled by NATO forces in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. This event, known as the Kunduz airlift, which is also popularly called the &quot;Airlift of Evil&quot;, involved several Pakistani Air Force transport planes flying multiple sorties over a number of days.

On May 1, 2011 Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan, he was living in a safe house less than a mile away from, what is called the West Point of Pakistan, the Pakistan Military Academy. This has given rise to numerous allegations of an extensive support system for Osama Bin Laden was in place by the Government and Military of Pakistan.

Former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai accused Pakistan for supporting ISIS during interview with ANI that Afghanistan has evidence of Pakistan&#x27;s support to ISIS.He added that there is no to the above statement.

Pervez Musharraf, former Pakistan President, had admitted in 2016 that Pakistan supported and trained terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba in 1990s to carry out militancy in Kashmir and Pakistan was in favour of religious militancy in 1979. He said that Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed were seen as heroes in Pakistan during the 1990s. He added that later on this religious militancy turned into terrorism and they started killing their own people. He also stated that Pakistan trained the Taliban to fight against Russia, saying that the Taliban, Osama bin Laden, Jalaluddin Haqqani and Ayman al-Zawahiri were heroes for Pakistan however later they became villains.

===Philippines===
Operation Merdeka was a destabilization plot planned with the objective of establishing Philippine control over Sabah. The operation failed to carry out, which resulted in the Jabidah massacre.

===Qatar===
In 2011 the &quot;Washington Times&quot; reported that Qatar was providing weapons and funding to Abdelhakim Belhadj, leader of the formerly U.S. designated terrorist group, Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and then leader of the conservative Islamist Al-Watan Party.

In December 2012 the &quot;New York Times&quot; published an editorial accusing the Qatari regime of funding the Al-Nusra Front, a U.S. government designated terrorist organization. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; noted Emir Hamad&#x27;s visit to Gaza and meeting with Hamas, another internationally designated terrorist organization. Spanish football club FC Barcelona were coming under increasing pressure to tear up their £125m shirt sponsorship contract with the Qatar Foundation after claims the so-called charitable trust finances Hamas. The fresh controversy follows claims made by the Spanish newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; that the Qatar Foundation had given money to cleric Yusuf al Qaradawi who is alleged to be an advocate of terrorism, wife beating and antisemitism.

In January 2013 French politicians again accused the Qatari Government of giving material support to Islamist groups in Mali and the French newspaper &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; quoted an unnamed source in French military intelligence saying that &quot;The MNLA [secular Tuareg separatists], al Qaeda-linked Ansar Dine and Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa have all received cash from Doha.&quot;

In March 2014, the then Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has accused the Qatari government of sponsoring Sunni insurgents fighting against Iraqi soldiers in western Anbar province.

In October 2014, it was revealed that a former Qatari Interior Ministry official, Salim Hasan Khalifa Rashid al-Kuwari, had been named by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as an al Qaeda financier, with allegations that he gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the terrorist group. Kuwari worked for the civil defense department of the Interior Ministry in 2009, two years before he was designated for his support of al Qaeda.

A number of wealthy Qataris are accused of sponsoring the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In response to public criticism over Qatari connections to ISIL, the government has pushed back and denied supporting the group.

===Russia and the Soviet Union ===
The Soviet (and later Russian) secret services worked to establish a network of terrorist front organizations and had been described as the primary promoters of terrorism worldwide. According to defector Ion Mihai Pacepa, General Aleksandr Sakharovsky from the First Chief Directorate of the KGB once said: &quot;In today’s world, when nuclear arms have made military force obsolete, terrorism should become our main weapon.&quot; Pacepa further claims Sakharovsky stated that &quot;Airplane hijacking is my own invention&quot; and that George Habash, who worked under the KGB&#x27;s guidance, explained: &quot;Killing one Jew far away from the field of battle is more effective than killing a hundred Jews on the field of battle, because it attracts more attention.&quot;

Pacepa described an alleged operation &quot;SIG&quot; (&quot;Zionist Governments&quot;) that was devised in 1972, to turn the whole Islamic world against Israel and the United States. KGB chairman Yury Andropov allegedly explained to Pacepa that &quot;a billion adversaries could inflict far greater damage on America than could a few millions. We needed to instill a Nazi-style hatred for the Jews throughout the Islamic world, and to turn this weapon of the emotions into a terrorist bloodbath against Israel and its main supporter, the United States.&quot;

The following organizations have been allegedly established with assistance from Eastern Bloc security services:
* the PLO,
* the National Liberation Army of Bolivia (created in 1964 with help from Ernesto Che Guevara),
* the National Liberation Army of Colombia (created in 1965 with help from Cuba),
* the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) in 1969, and the Armenian Secret Army for Liberation of Armenia in 1975.

The leader of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, established close collaboration with the Romanian Securitate service and the Soviet KGB in the beginning of the 1970s. The secret training of PLO guerrillas was provided by the KGB. However, the main KGB activities and arms shipments were channeled through Wadie Haddad of the DFLP organization, who usually stayed in a KGB dacha BARVIKHA-1 during his visits to Russia. Led by Carlos the Jackal, a group of PFLP fighters accomplished a spectacular raid on OPEC headquarters in Vienna in 1975. Advance notice of this operation &quot;was almost certainly&quot; given to the KGB.

A number of notable operations have been conducted by the KGB to support international terrorists with weapons on the orders from the Soviet Communist Party, including:
* Transfer of machine-guns, automatic rifles, Walther pistols, and cartridges to the Official Irish Republican Army by the Soviet intelligence vessel &quot;Reduktor&quot; (operation SPLASH) in 1972 to fulfill a personal request of arms from Michael O&#x27;Riordan.
* Transfer of anti-tank grenade RPG-7 launchers, radio-controlled SNOP mines, pistols with silencers, machine guns, and other weaponry to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine through Wadi Haddad who was recruited as a KGB agent in 1970 (operation VOSTOK, &quot;East&quot;).
* Support of the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party, in order to destabilize Turkey, a key NATO member during the Cold War.

Large-scale terrorist operations have been prepared by the KGB and GRU against the United States, Canada and Europe, according to the Mitrokhin Archive, GRU defectors Victor Suvorov and Stanislav Lunev, and former SVR officer Kouzminov. Among the planned operations were the following:
* Large arms caches were allegedly hidden in many countries for the planned terrorism acts. They were booby-trapped with &quot;Lightning&quot; explosive devices. One of such cache, which was identified by Mitrokhin, exploded when Swiss authorities tried to remove it from woods near Bern. Several others caches (probably not equipped with the &quot;Lightnings&quot;) were removed successfully.
* Preparations for nuclear sabotage. Some of the allegedly hidden caches could contain portable tactical nuclear weapons known as RA-115 &quot;suitcase bombs&quot; prepared to assassinate US leaders in the event of war, according to GRU defector Stanislav Lunev. Lunev states that he had personally looked for hiding places for weapons caches in the Shenandoah Valley area and that &quot;it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US&quot; either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip undetected when launched from a Russian airplane.
* Extensive sabotage plans in London, Washington, Paris, Bonn, Rome, and other Western capitals have been revealed by KGB defector Oleg Lyalin in 1971, including plan to flood the London underground and deliver poison capsules to Whitehall. This disclosure triggered mass expulsion of Russian spies from London.
* Disruption of the power supply in the entire New York State by KGB sabotage teams, which would be based along the Delaware River, in the Big Spring Park.
* An &quot;immensely detailed&quot; plan to destroy &quot;oil refineries and oil and gas pipelines across Canada from British Columbia to Montreal&quot; (operation &quot;Cedar&quot;) has been prepared, which took twelve years to complete.
* A plan for sabotage of Hungry Horse Dam in Montana.
* A detailed plan to destroy the port of New York (target GRANIT); most vulnerable points of the port were marked at maps.

==== Russia (1990 onwards)====
Alexander J. Motyl, professor of political science at Rutgers University argues that Russia&#x27;s direct and indirect involvement in the violence in eastern Ukraine qualifies as a state-sponsored terrorism, and that those involved qualify as &quot;terrorist groups.&quot; Russia&#x27;s behaviour towards its neighbours was alleged by Dalia Grybauskaitė, the President of Lithuania to be evidence of state terrorism. Grybauskaitė stated that &quot;Russia demonstrates the qualities of a terrorist state.&quot;
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov defined Russian forces as &quot;not military – they are terrorists, representatives of the terrorist state and this mark will be with them for a long time.&quot;

US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Lindsey Graham announced the introduction of a resolution calling on US president Joe Biden to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism by the United States for its war on Ukraine and conduct elsewhere under Vladimir Putin. In the introduction, Senator Graham said, &quot;Putin is a terrorist, and one of the most disruptive forces on the planet is Putin&#x27;s Russia.&quot;

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the following countries and international organisations have recognised Russia as a &quot;terrorist state&quot; or a &quot;state sponsor of terrorism&quot;:
*Czech Republic
*Estonia
*Latvia
*Lithuania

*Netherlands
*Poland
*Slovakia
*Ukraine

*The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe
*The European Parliament
In 2023 Poland security services detained a network of agents recruited by GRU initially for surveillance of military transports, and later tasked with arson, assassinations, terrorist attacks and derailing of weapons transports headed to Ukraine.

===Saudi Arabia===

While Saudi Arabia is often a secondary source of funds and support for terror movements who can find more motivated and ideologically invested benefactors, Saudi Arabia arguably remains the most prolific sponsor of international Islamist terrorism, allegedly supporting groups as disparate as the Afghanistan Taliban, Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Al-Nusra Front.

Saudi Arabia is said to be the world&#x27;s largest source of funds and promoter of Salafist jihadism, which forms the ideological basis of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, Taliban, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and others. In a December 2009 diplomatic cable to U.S. State Department staff (made public in the diplomatic cable leaks the following year), U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged U.S. diplomats to increase efforts to block money from Gulf Arab states from going to terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan, writing that &quot;Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide&quot; and that &quot;More needs to be done since Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaeda, the Taliban, LeT and other terrorist groups.&quot; An August 2009 State Department cable also said that the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, which carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks, used a Saudi-based front company to fund its activities in 2005.

The violence in Afghanistan and Pakistan is partly bankrolled by wealthy, conservative donors across the Arabian Sea whose governments do little to stop them. Three other Arab countries which are listed as sources of militant money are Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, all neighbors of Saudi Arabia.

According to two studies published in 2007 (one by Mohammed Hafez of the University of Missouri in Kansas City and the other by Robert Pape of the University of Chicago), most of the suicide bombers in Iraq are Saudis.

Fifteen of the 19 hijackers of the four airliners who were responsible for 9/11 originated from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, one from Egypt, and one from Lebanon. Osama bin Laden was born and educated in Saudi Arabia.

Starting in the mid-1970s the Islamic resurgence was funded by an abundance of money from Saudi Arabian oil exports. The tens of billions of dollars in &quot;petro-Islam&quot; largess obtained from the recently heightened price of oil funded an estimated &quot;90% of the expenses of the entire faith.&quot;

Throughout the Sunni Muslim world, religious institutions for people both young and old, from children&#x27;s madrassas to high-level scholarships received Saudi funding,
&quot;books, scholarships, fellowships, and mosques&quot; (for example, &quot;more than 1500 mosques were built and paid for with money obtained from public Saudi funds over the last 50 years&quot;), along with training in the Kingdom for the preachers and teachers who went on to teach and work at these universities, schools, mosques, etc.
The funding was also used to reward journalists and academics who followed the Saudis&#x27; strict interpretation of Islam; and satellite campuses were built around Egypt for Al Azhar, the world&#x27;s oldest and most influential Islamic university.

The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism. In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only &quot;always oppose&quot; infidels &quot;in every way&quot;, but &quot;hate them for their religion ... for Allah&#x27;s sake&quot;, that democracy &quot;is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century&quot;, that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were &quot;infidels&quot;, etc. According to former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, while this effort has by no means converted all, or even most, Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations of Islam in Southeast Asia, and to pitch the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the &quot;gold standard&quot; of religion in minds of Muslims across the globe.

Patrick Cockburn accused Saudi Arabia of supporting extremist groups in the Syrian Civil War, writing: &quot;In Syria, in early 2015, it supported the creation of the Army of Conquest, primarily made up of the al-Qaeda affiliate the al-Nusra Front and the ideologically similar Ahrar al-Sham, which won a series of victories against the Syrian Army in Idlib province.&quot;

While the Saudi government denies claims that it exports religious or cultural extremism, it is argued that by its nature, Wahhabism encourages intolerance and promotes terrorism. Former CIA director James Woolsey described it as &quot;the soil in which Al-Qaeda and its sister terrorist organizations are flourishing.&quot; In 2015, Sigmar Gabriel, Vice-Chancellor of Germany, accused Saudi Arabia of supporting intolerance and extremism, saying: &quot;Wahhabi mosques are financed all over the world by Saudi Arabia. In Germany, many dangerous Islamists come from these communities.&quot; In May 2016, The New York Times editorialised that the kingdom allied to the U.S. had &quot;spent untold millions promoting Wahhabism, the radical form of Sunni Islam that inspired the 9/11 hijackers and that now inflames the Islamic State&quot;. Iranian Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst with ties to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said, “ISIS ideologically, financially and logistically is fully supported and sponsored by Saudi Arabia...They are one and the same”.

In 2014, former Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki stated that Saudi Arabia and Qatar started the civil wars in Iraq and Syria, and incited and encouraged terrorist movements, like ISIL and al-Qaeda, supporting them politically and in the media, with money and by buying weapons for them. Saudi Arabia denied the accusations which were criticised by the country, the Carnegie Middle East Center and the Royal United Services Institute.

One of the leaked Podesta emails from August 2014, addressed to John Podesta, identifies Saudi Arabia and Qatar as providing clandestine financial and logistic aid to ISIL and other &quot;radical Sunni groups.&quot; The email outlines a plan of action against ISIL, and urges putting pressure on Saudi Arabia and Qatar to end their alleged support for the group. Whether the email was originally written by Hillary Clinton, her advisor Sidney Blumenthal, or another person is unclear.

Following the 2017 Tehran attacks, Iranian authorities such as members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif, have accused Saudi Arabia of being behind the attacks. In a Twitter post, Zarif wrote, &quot;Terror-sponsoring despots threaten to bring the fight to our homeland. Proxies attack what their masters despise most: the seat of democracy&quot;. His statements referred to the Saudi deputy crown prince Mohammad bin Salman&#x27;s threats against the country about a month earlier, in which bin Salman revealed their policy to drag the regional conflict into Iranian borders. Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s foreign minister, denied his country&#x27;s involvement in the attacks and said Riyadh had no knowledge of who was responsible for them. He condemned terrorist attacks and killing of the innocent &quot;anywhere it occurs&quot;.

In 2017 Bob Corker, then-chairman of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, stated that the Saudi support for terrorism &quot;dwarfs what Qatar is doing&quot;; the statement was made after Saudi Arabia cut ties with Qatar, citing alleged support of terrorism by the latter.

According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, the United Kingdom government may decide to keep secret the results of an official inquiry into the supporters of the Islamist militant groups in the country. The findings are believed to have references to Saudi Arabia.

Following various accusations relating to sponsoring terrorism, Saudi Arabia became eager to join the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF). However, a review conducted by the FATF on Saudi’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing system, pointed that the kingdom has not been able to tackle the risk of terrorism financing by third-party and facilitators, as well as individuals financing international terrorist organizations.

In 2019, Saudi Arabia has been granted a full membership of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) becoming the first Arab country awarded this full membership. This was following the group’s Annual General Meeting in Orlando. The group is responsible for designing and issuing standards and policies that face money laundering and terrorist financing.

Attorneys who defended Saudi Arabia in the 9/11 lawsuits, are reported to be representing crown prince Mohammed bin Salman in the alleged targeting and assassination of an ex-intelligence official from Saudi Arabia. The cases filed in August accused the prince of committing human rights violations, murder, and torture.

===Sudan===
Sudan was considered a state sponsor of terrorism by the US government from 1993 to 2020, and was targeted by United Nations sanctions in 1996 for its role in sheltering suspects of an attempted assassination of Hosni Mubarak, president of Egypt. Sudan has been suspected of harboring members of the terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Abu Nidal Organization, Jamaat al-Islamiyya, and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, as well as supporting insurgencies in Uganda, Tunisia, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Voice of America News reported that Sudan is suspected by US officials of allowing the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army to operate within its borders.

In December 1994, Eritrea broke diplomatic relations with Sudan after a long period of increasing tension between the two countries due to a series of cross-border incidents involving the Eritrean Islamic Jihad (EIJ). Although the attacks did not pose a threat to the stability of the Government of Eritrea (the infiltrators have generally been killed or captured by government forces), the Eritreans believe the National Islamic Front (NIF) in Khartoum supported, trained, and armed the insurgents. After many months of negotiations with the Sudanese to try to end the incursions, the Government of Eritrea concluded that the NIF did not intend to change its policy and broke relations. Subsequently, the Government of Eritrea hosted a conference of Sudanese opposition leaders in June 1995 in an effort to help the opposition unite and to provide a credible alternative to the present government in Khartoum. Eritrea resumed diplomatic relations with Sudan on December 10, 2005. Since then, Sudan has accused Eritrea, along with Chad, of supporting rebels. The undemarcated border with Sudan previously posed a problem for Eritrean external relations.

Sudan was accused of allowing members of Hamas to travel to and live in the country, as well as raise funds, though the presence of terrorists in Sudan has largely been a secondary concern in terms of Sudanese sponsorship of terror to the facilitation of material supplies to terrorist groups and the use of Sudan by Palestine-based terrorist organizations has declined in recent years. The Allied Democratic Forces, designated as a terrorist organization by Uganda, is said to be supported by Sudan and suspected of affiliation with widely designated terrorist group Al-Shabaab

Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are said to have been formerly based in Sudan during the early 1990s. The US and Israel have conducted operations against Sudanese targets affiliated with terrorist groups as recently as 2012.

Following the fall of Omar Al Bashir as the president of Sudan and the visit of the newly appointed Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok to Washington, the United States agreed to exchange ambassadors and said it would consider dropping Sudan from its list of countries of state sponsored terrorism.

On December 14, 2020, the United States officially removed Sudan from the list after it agreed to establish relations with Israel and pay $335m to US victims of terror attacks.

===Syria===

After his seizure of power in 1970, Hafez al-Assad allied Ba&#x27;athist Syria closely to the Eastern Bloc and adopted an anti-Zionist, anti-American strategy in the region by militarizing the Syrian state. The Ba&#x27;athist Syrian government itself was accused of engaging in state sponsored terrorism by U.S. President George W. Bush and by the U.S. State Department since 1979. Syria was designated as a &quot;State Sponsor of Terrorism&quot; by the United States in 1979 for Hafez&#x27;s occupation policy in Lebanon and financing of numerous militant groups like PKK, Hezbollah, and several Iranian-backed terrorist groups. 

After the fall of Soviet Union, the Syrian government lost its primary military supplier and geo-political ally; and became a pariah state, isolated in the international arena for its destabilizing policies and severe domestic repression. The 30-year rule of Hafez al-Assad was widely viewed as a force of destabilization in the region due to Syrian military&#x27;s occupation of Lebanon and Assad government&#x27;s policies of facilitating Iran-aligned terrorist groups. The European Community met on 10 November 1986 to discuss the Hindawi affair, an attempt to bomb an El Al flight out of London, and the subsequent arrest and trial in the UK of Nizar Hindawi, who allegedly received Syrian government support after the bombing, and possibly beforehand. The European response was to impose sanctions against Syria and state that these measures were intended &quot;to send Syria the clearest possible message that what has happened is absolutely unacceptable.&quot;

After his succession in 2000, Bashar maintained core aspects of his father&#x27;s foreign policy. On 14 February 2005, Rafic Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon, was assassinated in a massive truck-bomb explosion in Beirut, killing 22 people and injuring 220 more. Syrian government was widely blamed for perpetrating the terrorist attack. Bashar al-Assad is widely regarded to have ordered the launch of the terrorist operation that targeted Rafic Hariri. International investigations revealed direct participation of members in the highest echelons of the Syrian government. A UN investigation commission&#x27;s report, published on 20 October 2005, revealed that high-ranking members of Syrian intelligence and the ruling Assad family had directly supervised the killing.

After the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Bashar supported the Iraqi insurgency against the United States and the Iraqi interim government. Syrian government allowed numerous fighters to pass through Syrian borders to fight the American occupation forces. Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, Secretary-General of the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath party, had close relations with Ba&#x27;athist Syria. After the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, al-Douri reportedly fled to Damascus, from where he co-ordinated with several anti-American militant groups during the Iraqi insurgency. Throughout the years of the anti-American insurgency in Iraq, thousands of al-Qaeda fighters entered Iraq through Syria. According to several sources, Assef Shawkat, then-chief of Syrian military intelligence and Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s nephew, was reportedly a key Syrian facilitator of the logistic networks of Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Leaked cables of U.S. State Department contained remarks by American general David Petraeus which stated that &quot;Bashar al-Asad was well aware that his brother-in-law &#x27;Asif Shawqat, Director of Syrian Military Intelligence, had detailed knowledge of the activities of AQI facilitator Abu Ghadiya, who was using Syrian territory to bring foreign fighters and suicide bombers into Iraq&quot;.

In 2016, the US district court of Columbia declared that the financial and logistical support of the Syrian government was crucial for establishing a well-structured pathway for the fighters of Al-Qaeda in Iraq in carrying out anti-American combat operations throughout the Iraqi insurgency. The court further stated that Syria &quot;became a crucial base for AQI&quot;, by hosting several associates of Abu Mus&#x27;ab al-Zarqawi and leading commanders of the insurgency, and stated that Syria&#x27;s policies &quot;led to the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq&quot;. The district court also found evidence of Syrian military intelligence assisting Al-Qaeda in Iraq and giving &quot;crucial material support&quot; to AQI militants who carried out the 2005 Amman bombings.

===Turkey===
Francis Ricciardone, United States Ambassador to Turkey from 2011 to 2014, claims that Turkey had directly supported and worked with al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham in the Syrian conflict for a period of time. Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Iran and Egypt have designated Ahrar al-Sham a terrorist organization but the U.S. has not. The United Nations Security Council and many countries including the US class al-Nusra as a terrorist organisation; it was the official Syrian branch of al-Qaeda until July 2016, when it ostensibly split.

Al-Monitor claimed in 2013 that Turkey was reconsidering its support for Nusra, and Turkey&#x27;s designation of the Nusra Front as a terrorist group since June 2014 was seen as an indication of it giving up on the group.

Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia supported the Army of Conquest, a coalition of Salafist and Islamist Syrian rebel groups formed in March 2015 that included the al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham, but that also included non-al-Qaeda-linked Islamist factions, such as the Sham Legion, that have received covert arms support from the United States. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, some Turkish officials admitted giving logistical and intelligence support to the command center of the coalition, but denied giving direct help to al-Nusra, while acknowledging that the group would be beneficiaries. It also reported that some rebels and officials claim that material support in the form of money and weapons was given to the coalition by Saudis with Turkey facilitating its passage.

The 2014 National Intelligence Organisation scandal caused a major controversy in Turkey. The critiques of the government claimed that the Turkish government has been providing arms to ISIL, while the Turkish government has maintained that the trucks were bound for the Bayırbucak Turkmens, who are opposed to the Syrian government. According to later academic study the arms were bound for the Free Syrian Army and rebel Syrian Turkmen.

In 2014, Sky News reported that the Turkish government had stamped passports of foreigners seeking to cross the border and join ISIL. However, it was also reported by Sky News that ISIL members use fake passports in order to get to Syria and Turkish officials can not easily identify the authenticity of these documents.

YPG commander Meysa Abdo in an op-ed written for NY Times on October 28 claimed there is evidence that Turkish forces have allowed the Islamic State’s men and equipment to move back and forth across the border. On November 29, Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria’s Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), reportedly said that ISIL started to attack them from all four sides for the first time. Turkey&#x27;s hesitation to help YPG and PYD in the fight against ISIL was reportedly caused by their affiliation with the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the UN, EU and many countries including US, but Turkey later gave support to the Kurdish Peshmerga from northern Iraq instead of the YPG, allowing 155 peshmerga to pass through Turkey with their arms who, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told, would initially be about 2000 but PYD was reluctant to accept. Ahmet Gerdi, a Peshmerga general, told the Turkish press that they appreciate Turkey&#x27;s help in their fight against ISIL.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and President Vladimir Putin accused Turkish officials of helping the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the aftermath of shootdown of a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 on 25 November. These accusations were rejected by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In October 2015, the office of the Turkish Prime Minister had stated that while smuggling of oil between Turkey and Syria had taken place, the nation had been successful in effectively stopping it. In December 2015, the Russian ministry of defence claimed it had evidence regarding the Turkish president and his relatives being involved in oil trade with Islamic State. It also published pictures purporting to show trucks carrying oil travelling from oil installations under ISIL control into Turkey. Mark Toner, the deputy spokesperson for the United States Department of State, rejected these claims stating there was no proof to back up the claims of Turkish government being involved in oil trade with ISIL who was selling oil in Turkey through middlemen. Russia also accused Turkey of allowing weapons trade with ISIL. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest meanwhile stated they had intelligence that most of the terror group&#x27;s oil was being sold to the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.

Several analysts meanwhile, have also claimed Russia&#x27;s accusations of Turkey&#x27;s cooperation as baseless, while also stating that a small amount of oil might end up in Turkey with cooperation from some middlemen and corrupt officials but much of it is actually sold in Syria. American officials meanwhile stated that the smuggling of oil by ISIL into Turkey was low. Adam Szubin, the acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, also stated that most of the oil was being sold in areas under Syrian government&#x27;s control, with only some going towards Turkey. Israel&#x27;s Minister of Defence Moshe Ya&#x27;alon also accused Turkey of purchasing oil from the terror group in January 2016. In December, WikiLeaks released 57,000 emails of Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak stolen by RedHack, a hacktivist group. 32 of them included him directing business affairs of Powertrans, which has been accused by Turkish media of transporting ISIL oil in past and whom Albayrak had denied having links with. &quot;The Independent&quot; however had stated in past that the reports of Powertrans smuggling ISIL oil had no concrete proof.

Some Arab and Syrian media agencies claimed that the village of Az-Zanbaqi (الزنبقي) in Jisr al-Shughur&#x27;s countryside has become a base for a massive amount of Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party militants and their families in Syria, estimated at around 3,500. They further accused the Turkish intelligence of being involved in transporting these Uyghurs via Turkey to Syria, with the aim of using them first in Syria to help Jabhat Al-Nusra and gain combat experience fighting against the Syrian Army before sending them back to Xinjiang to fight against China if they manage to survive.

In 2016, Jordan&#x27;s king accused Turkey of helping Islamist militias in Libya and Somalia.

In 2019, the Libyan National Army accused the Turkish authorities of supporting terrorist groups in Libya for many years. They added that the Turkish support has evolved from just logistic support to a direct interference using military aircraft to transport mercenaries, as well as ships carrying weapons, armored vehicles and ammunition to support terrorism in Libya.

=== Ukraine ===
In 2024, Mali and Niger severed relations with Ukraine after declaring it a sponsor of terrorism, claiming it supported terrorist organizations in Ukraine&#x27;s acknowledged involvement in an act of aggression against Mali.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
No official connection to state sponsored terrorism was found between the United Arab Emirates government to terrorists, however the UAE has been listed as a place used by investors to raise funds to support militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Taliban and their militant partners the Haqqani network has been reported to raise funds through UAE-based businesses.

The United States Library of Congress Research Division in its 2007 report reported the UAE to be a major transit point for terrorists, stating that more than half of the 9/11 hijackers directly flew out of Dubai International Airport to the United States. The report also indicated that UAE based banks were utilized by the hijackers.

The United Arab Emirates has been fighting alongside General Khalifa Haftar’s army in the Libya war. As mentioned in a December, 2019 International Peace Institute report, the army led by Haftar comprises militias. Meanwhile, according to another report, UAE has been accused by the United Nations of breaching its 1970 arms embargo imposed on Libya, in a 376-page report. Weapons obtained by the Haftar army, were Pantsir S-1 surface-to-air missile system, which is “a configuration only the United Arab Emirates uses”. In the airstrikes led by the United Arab Emirates, more than 100 civilians have been reportedly killed and injured, while 100,000 have been reported to be displaced.

On 30 April 2020, Financial Action Task Force said that the UAE’s actions to combat terrorist financing and money laundering were not enough. The watchdog acclaimed that it will now put region’s financial centre Dubai under a year-long observation and monitor 10 of 11 missing pointers required to improve laundering along with the financing of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.

OFAC sanctioned 16 entities and individuals, in businesses spreading across the Horn of Africa, the UAE and Cyprus. This business network was alleged of raising and laundering millions of dollars for Al-Shabaab. The US Treasury Department stated that al-Shabaab’s key financial facilitator is Dubai-based Haleel Commodities L.L.C., along with its subsidiaries and branches in Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, and Cyprus. The influential businesspersons serving al-Shabaab’s financial facilitators included, UAE-based Qemat Al Najah General Trading and Mohamed Artan Robel; Kenya-based Faysal Yusuf Dini and Mohamed Jumale Ali Awale; Finland-based Somali citizen Hassan Abdirahman Mahamed; and Somalia-based Abdikarin Farah Mohamed and Farhan Hussein Hayder.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom supported Ulster loyalist paramilitaries during The Troubles in Northern Ireland. During the 1970s, a group of loyalists known as the &quot;Glenanne gang&quot; carried out numerous shootings and bombings against Irish Catholics and Irish nationalists in an area of Northern Ireland known as the &quot;murder triangle&quot;. It also carried out some cross-border attacks in the Republic of Ireland. The group included members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paramilitary group as well as Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) police officers. It was allegedly commanded by the Intelligence Corps and RUC Special Branch. Evidence suggests that the group was responsible for the deaths of about 120 civilians. The &quot;Cassel Report&quot; investigated 76 killings attributed to the group and found evidence that UDR soldiers and RUC policemen were involved in 74 of those. One former member, RUC officer John Weir, claimed his superiors knew of the group&#x27;s activities but allowed it to continue. Attacks attributed to the group include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings (which killed 34 civilians), the Miami Showband killings and the Reavey and O&#x27;Dowd killings. The UK has also been accused of providing intelligence material, training, firearms, explosives and lists of people that members of the security forces wanted to have killed to Loyalist paramilitaries.

The Stevens Inquiries concluded that the Force Research Unit (FRU), a covert unit of the Intelligence Corps, helped loyalists to kill people, including civilians. FRU commanders say their plan was to make loyalist groups &quot;more professional&quot; by helping them target IRA activists and prevent them killing civilians. The Stevens Inquiries found evidence only two lives were saved and that FRU was involved with at least 30 loyalist killings and many other attacks – many of the victims uninvolved civilians. One of the most prominent killings was that of the Republican solicitor Pat Finucane. A FRU double-agent also helped ship weapons to loyalists from South Africa. Stevens would later claim that members of the security forces attempted to obstruct his team&#x27;s investigation.

Starting in 1979, the UK worked alongside the US and Saudi Arabia to fund and arm the Mujahedeen under Operation Cyclone, which arguably contributed to the creation of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda (more information here on United Kingdom in the Soviet–Afghan War).

The UK has also been accused by Iran of supporting Arab separatist terrorism in the southern city of Ahvaz in 2006.

===United States===

Starting in 1959, under the Eisenhower administration, the US government had the Central Intelligence Agency recruit operatives in Cuba to carry out terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage. Following the failed invasion at the Bay of Pigs, the US massively escalated its sponsorship of terrorism against Cuba. In late 1961, using the military and the Central Intelligence Agency, the US government engaged in an extensive campaign of state-sponsored terrorism against civilian and military targets in Cuba. The terrorist attacks killed significant numbers of civilians. The US armed, trained, funded and directed the terrorists, most of whom were Cuban expatriates. Terrorist attacks were planned at the direction and with the participation of US government employees and launched from US territory. The terrorist attacks directed by the CIA continued through at least 1965, and the CIA was ordered to intensify the campaign in 1969. Andrew Bacevich, Professor of International Relations and History at Boston University, wrote of the campaign: 

The United States had trained militant Cuban exiles Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch as part of this state-sponsored terrorism campaign. They are widely understood to be responsible for the Cubana 455 bombing, the deadliest instance of airline terrorism in the western hemisphere prior to the attacks of September 2001 in New York and Washington. The US Justice Department recorded Bosch as having participated in at least thirty terrorist attacks, and sought to deport him when he entered the US illegally. Bosch was released by the US Government without charges at the instruction of George H. W. Bush, and Bosch was granted residency in the country.

Starting in 1979, the US worked alongside the UK and Saudi Arabia to fund and arm the Mujahedeen under Operation Cyclone as part of the Reagan Doctrine, which arguably contributed to the creation of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. However, scholars such as Jason Burke, Steve Coll, Peter Bergen, Christopher Andrew, and Vasily Mitrokhin have argued that Osama bin Laden was &quot;outside of CIA eyesight&quot; and that support from reliable sources are lacking for &quot;the claim that the CIA funded bin Laden or any of the other Arab volunteers who came to support the mujahideen.&quot; 

The US has been accused of arming and training a political and fighting force of some Kurds in Syria, the People&#x27;s Protection Units (YPG), which is a sister organization of Turkey&#x27;s Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The PKK is listed in the US Department of State&#x27;s Foreign Terrorist Organizations list, and described as &quot;a US-designated terrorist organization&quot; in the CIA&#x27;s World Factbook, but the YPG is not.

===Venezuela===

In 2019, the National Assembly of Venezuela designated the colectivos (irregular, leftist Venezuelan community organizations that support Nicolás Maduro, the Bolivarian government and the Great Patriotic Pole) as terrorist groups due to their &quot;violence, paramilitary actions, intimidation, murders and other crimes&quot;, declaring their acts as state-sponsored terrorism.

<text>Tomorrow Never Dies is a 1997 spy film, the eighteenth in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode from a screenplay by Bruce Feirstein, it follows Bond as he attempts to prevent Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), a power-mad media mogul, from engineering world events to initiate World War III.

The film was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. It was the first Bond film made after the death of producer Albert R. Broccoli (to whom it pays tribute in the end credits) and the last released under the United Artists label. Filming locations included France, Thailand, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; performed well at the box office, grossing over $339 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1997 and earning a Golden Globe nomination despite mixed reviews. While its performance at the U.S. box office surpassed that of its predecessor &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, it was the only one of Brosnan&#x27;s Bond films not to open at No. 1 at the box office, as it opened the same day as &quot;Titanic&quot;, and finished at No. 2 that week.

==Plot==
MI6 sends James Bond into the field to reconnoiter a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite M&#x27;s insistence on letting 007 finish his reconnaissance mission, Royal Navy Rear Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS &quot;Chester&quot; to fire a Harpoon missile at the bazaar. Bond discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros trainer jet; with the missile out of range to be aborted, Bond is forced to pilot the L-39 away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.

Media baron Elliot Carver starts his plans to use an encoder obtained at the bazaar by his associate, cyberterrorist Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the UK. Meaconing (faking) the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the frigate HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot; off course into Chinese-occupied waters in the South China Sea, where Carver&#x27;s stealth ship, commanded by Carver&#x27;s chief enforcer Stamper, ambushes and sinks it with a &quot;sea drill&quot; torpedo. Carver&#x27;s henchmen steal one of &quot;Devonshire&quot;&#x27;s missiles and shoot down a Chinese MiG fighter jet investigating the scene. Stamper kills the &quot;Devonshire&quot;&#x27;s survivors with weaponry loaded with Chinese ammunition. The British Minister of Defence orders Roebuck to deploy the fleet to investigate the sinking of the frigate, and demands retaliation, leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war.

M sends Bond to investigate Carver and his company, CMGN, after Carver released news articles about the crisis hours before MI6 had become aware of it. Bond travels to Hamburg to seduce Carver&#x27;s wife, Paris (an ex-girlfriend of Bond&#x27;s), to get information that would help him enter CMGN headquarters. He defeats Stamper&#x27;s men and cuts Carver off the air during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. Carver discovers the truth about Paris and Bond and orders both of them killed. Bond and Paris reconcile in Bond&#x27;s hotel room, and she provides him with information to infiltrate Carver&#x27;s newspaper facility. Bond steals the GPS encoder from Gupta&#x27;s office at the facility; meanwhile, Carver&#x27;s assassin and Stamper&#x27;s mentor Dr. Kaufman kills Paris. After Bond returns to find Paris&#x27;s body, Kaufman holds him at gunpoint. Bond is able to kill Kaufman and escape his henchmen through a multistory car park in his Q-branch vehicle, a BMW 750iL with remote control.

At a U.S. Air Force base in Okinawa, Bond teams with his CIA contact Jack Wade and meets GPS technician Dr. Dave Greenwalt. Bond understands that the encoder had been tampered with, and goes to the South China Sea to investigate the wreck. He and Wai Lin, a Chinese Ministry of State Security agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but after reaching the surface they are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in Saigon. They soon escape and contact the Royal Navy and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force to explain Carver&#x27;s scheme. Carver plans to destroy most of the Chinese government with the stolen missile, allowing a corrupt Chinese general named Chang to assume power and negotiate a truce between Britain and China, both of which will have begun a naval war. Once the conflict is over, Carver will be given exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next century, which would then allow his broadcasting network to be completely global.

Bond and Wai Lin board Carver&#x27;s stealth ship to prevent him from firing the missile at Beijing; Wai Lin is captured, forcing Bond to devise a second plan. Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage, but Carver kills Gupta, claiming he has &quot;outlived his contract&quot;. Bond detonates a grenade in the hull, damaging the ship, thus rendering it visible to radar and vulnerable to a subsequent Royal Navy attack. While Wai Lin disables the engines, she is recaptured by Stamper. Bond kills Carver with his own drilling machine and attempts to destroy the warhead with detonators, but Stamper attacks him, sending a chained Wai Lin into the water. Bond traps Stamper in the missile firing mechanism and saves Wai Lin as the missile explodes, destroying the ship and killing Stamper. Bond and Wai Lin kiss amidst the wreckage as HMS &quot;Bedford&quot; searches for them.

==Production==
&quot;Bond 18&quot; was greenlit after the positive public reception to the teaser trailer for &quot;GoldenEye&quot; in May 1995. Following &quot;GoldenEye&quot;&#x27;s success in reviving the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the next production. This pressure came from MGM which, along with its new owner, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, wanted the film&#x27;s release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer Michael G. Wilson commented: &quot;You realize that there&#x27;s a huge audience and I guess you don&#x27;t want to come out with a film that&#x27;s going to somehow disappoint them.&quot;

It was the first Bond film made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, who was involved with the series&#x27; production since its inception; the film is dedicated to his memory. The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $110 million. The producers were unable to persuade &quot;GoldenEye&quot; director Martin Campbell to return, as he had chosen to direct &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; instead; his agent said, &quot;Martin just didn&#x27;t want to do two Bond films in a row.&quot; Roger Spottiswoode was chosen to direct in September 1996; he had offered to direct &quot;GoldenEye&quot; when Timothy Dalton was still cast as Bond.

===Writing===
Initial writers included John Cork, Richard Smith, and novelist Donald E. Westlake. In 1995, Westlake wrote two story treatments in collaboration with Wilson, both of which featured a villain who planned to destroy Hong Kong with explosives on the eve of the city&#x27;s July 1997 transfer of sovereignty to China. Westlake used some of his ideas for a novel he completed the next year, though it was not published until 2017 under the title &quot;Forever and a Death&quot;. Director Spottiswoode said that, in January 1997, MGM had a script also focused on the Hong Kong handover; however, it could not be used for a film opening at the end of the year, so they had to start &quot;almost from scratch at T-minus zero!&quot;

Bruce Feirstein, who worked on &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, wrote the initial script. He claimed that his inspiration was his own experience working with journalism and viewing both Sky News and CNN&#x27;s 24-hour news coverage of the Gulf War, stating that he aimed to &quot;write something that was grounded in a nightmare of reality.&quot; The script was handed to Spottiswoode, who then gathered seven Hollywood screenwriters in London to brainstorm, eventually choosing Nicholas Meyer to do rewrites. The script was also worked on by Dan Petrie Jr. and David Campbell Wilson before Feirstein was brought back for a final polish. Although Feirstein retained sole writing credit in the film and publicity materials, Meyer, Petrie and Wilson were given credit with Feirstein on the title page of the film&#x27;s novelization by Raymond Benson. While many reviewers compared Elliot Carver to Rupert Murdoch, Feirstein based the character on Robert Maxwell, with Carver&#x27;s reported death bearing similarities to that of Maxwell&#x27;s; that is, &quot;Missing, presumed drowned, while on a cruise aboard his luxury yacht,&quot; as stated by M at the end of the film. However, Spottiswoode himself said in a 2004 interview that &quot;Carver is Rupert Murdoch&quot;.

In the original script when Bond is set to parachute into Vietnam he is told by a CIA agent that “You know what will happen. It will be war. And maybe this time, maybe we’ll win”. The Pentagon was embarrassed by this line and it was subsequently removed.

Wilson said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t have a script that was ready to shoot on the first day of filming&quot;, while Pierce Brosnan said, &quot;We had a script that was not functioning in certain areas.&quot;

The title was inspired by the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. The eventual title came about by accident. One of the potential titles was &quot;Tomorrow Never Lies&quot; (referring to the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; newspaper in the plot), and this was faxed to MGM. However, due to a misunderstanding by the fax recipient, it became &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, a title MGM found so attractive that they insisted on using it. The title was the first not to have any relation to Fleming&#x27;s life or work.

===Casting===
Teri Hatcher was three months pregnant when shooting started, although her publicist stated the pregnancy did not affect the production schedule. Hatcher later regretted playing Paris Carver, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s such an artificial kind of character to be playing that you don&#x27;t get any special satisfaction from it.&quot; Actress Sela Ward auditioned for the role; the producers reportedly said they wanted her &quot;but ten years younger&quot;. Hatcher, at 32, was seven years Ward&#x27;s junior, and playing Lois Lane on the television show &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,&quot; where she was voted the &quot;Sexiest Woman on Television&quot; by readers of &quot;TV Guide&quot; the previous year. Brosnan also screen-tested with Italian Monica Bellucci, but the studio maintained that the role could be given only to an American actress. Brosnan remarked: &quot;The fools said no.&quot; Daphne Deckers, who portrays the PR woman, also confirms that she saw Bellucci the same day she herself auditioned. Bellucci subsequently had a role in the 24th Bond film, &quot;Spectre&quot;.

The role of Elliot Carver was initially offered to Anthony Hopkins (who was also offered a role in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;), but he declined in favor of &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;.

Natasha Henstridge was rumoured as cast in the lead Bond Girl role, but eventually, Yeoh was confirmed. Brosnan was impressed, describing her as a &quot;wonderful actress&quot; who was &quot;serious and committed about her work&quot;. She reportedly wanted to perform her own stunts, but was prevented because director Spottiswoode ruled it too dangerous and prohibited by insurance restrictions.

When Götz Otto was called in for casting, his hair had been cropped short for a television role. He was given 20 seconds to introduce himself, but did it in five: &quot;I&#x27;m big, I&#x27;m bad, and I&#x27;m German.&quot; 

===Filming===
With Vic Armstrong directing the second unit, filming of the $11 million 4-minute pre-title sequence began on 18 January 1997 at , Peyragudes in the French Pyrenees. The plane Bond is seen to purloin in the movie was a Czech-built Aero Vodochody L-39ZO Albatros weapons jet trainer, supplied by a British company and flown by stunt pilots Tony &quot;Taff&quot; Smith and Mark (son of Ray) Hanna. After completing work in France, the second unit moved on to Portsmouth to film the scenes where the Royal Navy prepares to engage the Chinese, with standing in for the various fictional Type 23 Frigates in the story. The main unit began filming on 1 April. They were unable to use Leavesden Studios, which they had constructed from an abandoned Rolls-Royce factory for &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, as George Lucas was using it for &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, so instead they constructed sound stages in another derelict industrial site nearby. They also used the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios, the usual site for the Bond films since its inception, making it the first Bond film since &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; that was filmed there, as well as Elstree Studios. The scene at the &quot;U.S. Air Base in the South China Sea&quot; where Bond hands over the GPS encoder was actually filmed in the area known as Blue Section at RAF Lakenheath. The sea landing used the vast tank built for &quot;Titanic&quot; in Rosarito, Baja California. The MH-53J in the film was from the US Air Force&#x27;s 352d Special Operations Group at RAF Mildenhall.

Some scenes were planned to be filmed on location in Ho Chi Minh City, and the production had been granted a visa. It would have been the first major film to be shot in Vietnam since the Vietnam War. However, the visa was later rescinded by Vietnamese Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt two months after planning had begun, forcing filming to move to Bangkok. Bond spokesman Gordon Arnell claimed the Vietnamese were unhappy with crew and equipment needed for pyrotechnics, with a Vietnamese official saying it was due to &quot;many complicated reasons&quot;. Anthony Waye says he believed the decision was caused after Vietnam&#x27;s Communist government had viewed the opening credits of &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, which featured &quot;semi-naked ladies smashing up hammer-and-sickle emblems with sledgehammers, illustrating the fall of communism.&quot; Two locations from previous Bond films were used: Brosnan and Hatcher&#x27;s love scene was filmed at Stoke Park, which had been featured in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, and the bay where they search for Carver&#x27;s stealth boat is Phang Nga Bay, previously used for &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;.

The exterior of Elliot Carver&#x27;s CMGN Hamburg HQ was filmed at the IBM Building in Bedfont Lakes, Feltham, whilst Harmsworth Quays Printers Ltd in Surrey Quays, Rotherhithe, doubled for the interior of the Hamburg print facility.

Spottiswoode tried to innovate in the action scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in &quot;GoldenEye&quot; he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the steering wheel on the back seat. The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg, although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing a member of the public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.

Spottiswoode did not return to direct the next film; he said the producers asked him, but he was too tired. Brosnan and Hatcher were reported to have feuded briefly during filming due to her arriving late onto the set one day. The matter was quickly resolved, though, and Brosnan apologised to Hatcher after realising she was pregnant and was late for that reason.

&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; marked the first appearance of the Walther P99 as Bond&#x27;s pistol. It replaced the Walther PPK that the character had carried in every Eon Bond film since &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962, with the exception of &quot;Moonraker&quot; in which Bond was not seen with a pistol. Walther wanted to debut its new firearm in a Bond film, which had been one of its most visible endorsers. Previously, the P5 was introduced in &quot;Octopussy&quot;. Bond would use the P99 until Daniel Craig reverted to the PPK as 007 in &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; in 2008.

===Music===
Prolific composer John Barry was in talks to return to the James Bond films for the first time in a decade but could not reach an agreement over his salary, according to his then-agent Richard Kraft. Barbara Broccoli subsequently chose David Arnold to score &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; on a recommendation from Barry. Arnold had come to Barry&#x27;s attention through his successful cover interpretations in &quot;Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project&quot;, which featured major artists performing the former James Bond title songs in new arrangements. Arnold said that his score aimed for &quot;a classic sound but [with] a modern approach&quot;, combining techno music with a recognisably Barry-inspired &quot;classic Bond&quot; sound—notably Arnold borrowed from Barry&#x27;s score for &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. The score was done across a period of six months, with Arnold writing music and revising previous pieces as he received edited footage of the film. The music for the indoor car chase sequence was co-written with the band Propellerheads, who had worked with Arnold on &quot;Shaken and Stirred&quot;. The soundtrack was well received by critics with Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks describing it as &quot;an excellent tribute to the entire series of Bond score&quot;.

At first, the theme song was to be written by Arnold himself, with the help of lyricist Don Black and singer-songwriter David McAlmont, who recorded the demo. However, MGM wanted a more popular artist, and invited various singers to write songs before one was picked through a competitive process. There were around twelve submissions, including songs from Swan Lee, Pulp, Saint Etienne, Marc Almond, and Sheryl Crow. Crow&#x27;s song was chosen for the main titles. Arnold&#x27;s composition, &quot;Surrender&quot;, performed by k.d. lang, was still used for the end titles, and features the same prominent melodic motif as the film&#x27;s score. This was the fourth Bond film to have different opening and closing songs. Pulp&#x27;s effort was re-titled as &quot;Tomorrow Never Lies&quot; and appeared as a b-side on their 1997 single &quot;Help The Aged&quot;. The original &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; rough mix of the song was eventually released on the bonus disc of the &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot; deluxe edition in 2006. Moby created a remake of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; to be used for the movie. Two different versions of the soundtrack album were released, the first featuring only music from the first half of the film, and the second rectifying this but cutting several tracks, including the songs, to make room for the missing score tracks. In 2022 La La Land Records releases a two-disc expanded and limited edition of the complete score by Arnold.

==Release==
The film had a World Charity Premiere at The Odeon Leicester Square, on 9 December 1997; this was followed by an after premiere party at Bedford Square, home of original Ian Fleming publisher, Jonathan Cape. The film went into general release in the UK and Ireland on 12 December and in most other countries during the following week. It opened in second place in the United States and Canada, grossing $25.1 million behind &quot;Titanic&quot;, which would become the highest-grossing film of all time up to that point. &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; ultimately grossed $339.5 million worldwide, although it did not surpass its predecessor &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, which had earned over $356 million.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 57% rating based on 93 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A competent, if sometimes by-the-numbers entry to the 007 franchise, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; may not boast the most original plot but its action sequences are genuinely thrilling.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 based on 38 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, writing: &quot;&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; gets the job done, sometimes excitingly, often with style&quot; with the villain &quot;slightly more contemporary and plausible than usual&quot;, bringing &quot;some subtler-than-usual satire into the film&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote it was the &quot;first James Bond film I&#x27;ve liked in many a year&quot;, most notably favoring the character Elliot Carver, which he felt added &quot;contemporary writing to the Bond series, and that is most welcome.&quot; On his website &quot;ReelViews&quot;, James Berardinelli described it as &quot;the best Bond film in many years&quot; and said Brosnan &quot;inhabits his character with a suave confidence that is very like Connery&#x27;s.&quot; Kenneth Turan, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, thought that a lot of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; had a &quot;stodgy, been-there feeling&quot;, with little change from previous films. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized the film as &quot;a generic action event that it could be any old summer blockbuster, except that its hero is chronically overdressed.&quot; Charles Taylor wrote for &quot;Salon&quot; that the film was &quot;a flat, impersonal affair&quot;.

The title song sung by Sheryl Crow was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. The film received four nominations for Saturn Awards, with Brosnan winning for Best Actor. It also won a MPSE Golden Reel Award for &quot;Best Sound Editing – Foreign Feature&quot; and a BMI Film Music Award.
The original UK release received various cuts in scenes of violence and martial arts weaponry, to reduce the impact of sound effects and to receive a more box-office-friendly 12 certificate. Further cuts were made to the video/DVD release to retain this rating. These edits were restored for the Ultimate Edition DVD release in the UK, which was consequently upgraded to a 15 certificate. However, upon the release of the Blu-ray in 2012, it was rated back down to a 12 uncut.

===Retrospective reviews===
In the wake of its original release, critics and audiences have praised &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; for its prescience. The website &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, on the film&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, observed of the film&#x27;s plot: &quot;It&#x27;s an improbable set-up which was likely intended as a satire of Murdoch&#x27;s unaccountable media empire, but the risks of such technological manipulation have since proved to be frighteningly plausible.&quot; &quot;Den of Geek&quot; also highlights that &quot;technology wasn&#x27;t the only modern danger to be pre-empted by &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;—it also offers a revealing peek into the confused state of the British national psyche, which might help to explain the country&#x27;s ongoing Brexit debates.&quot;

Similarly, &quot;HeadStuff&quot; highlighted its relevance in 2020, noting that &quot;some modern critics argue that Carver&#x27;s emphasis on traditional journalism date the film and that if the Internet existed to such an extent as it does twenty years later, his plan would be instantly foiled... not really sure those people have been following current events over the past two years.&quot;

The American Film Institute nominated the film in 2001 for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Thrills and David Arnold&#x27;s score in 2005 for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores.

Andrew Heritage mentions &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; in his book &quot;Great Movies: 100 Years of Cinema&quot; alongside &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;.

==Appearances in other media==
&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; was the first of three Bond films to be adapted into books by then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson. Benson&#x27;s version is expanded from the screenplay including additional scenes with Wai Lin and other supporting characters not in the film. The novel traces Carver&#x27;s background as the son of media mogul Lord Roverman, whom Carver blackmails into suicide, later taking over his business. The novel also attempts to merge Benson&#x27;s series with the films, particularly by continuing a middle-of-the-road approach to John Gardner&#x27;s continuity. Notably it includes a reference to the film version of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; where he states that Bond was lying to Miss Moneypenny when he said he had taken a course in Asian languages. &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; also mentions Felix Leiter, although it states that Leiter had worked for Pinkertons Detective Agency, which is thus exclusive to the literary series. Subsequent Bond novels by Benson were affected by &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, specifically Bond&#x27;s weapon of choice being changed from the Walther PPK to the Walther P99. Benson said in an interview that he felt &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; was the best of the three novelisations he wrote.

The film was also adapted into a third-person shooter PlayStation video game, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. The game was developed by Black Ops and published by Electronic Arts on 16 November 1999. Game Revolution described it as &quot;really just an empty and shallow game&quot;, and IGN said it was &quot;mediocre&quot;.

<doc id="317658" wikidata="Q1624307" url="?curid=317658" title="Balcones Fault">
<text>The Balcones Fault or Balcones Fault Zone is an area of largely normal faulting in the U.S. state of Texas that runs roughly from the southwest part of the state near Del Rio to the north-central region near Dallas along Interstate 35. The Balcones Fault zone is made up of many smaller features, including normal faults, grabens, and horsts. One of the obvious features is the Mount Bonnell Fault.

The location of the fault zone may be related to the Ouachita Mountains, formed 300 million years ago during a continental collision. Although long since worn away in Texas, the roots of these ancient mountains still exist, buried beneath thousands of feet of sediment. These buried Ouachita Mountains may still be an area of weakness that becomes a preferred site for faulting when stress exists in the Earth&#x27;s crust.

The Balcones Fault has remained inactive for nearly 15 million years, with the last activity being during the Neogene period. This activity was related to subsidence of the Texas Coastal Plain, most likely from the large amount of sediment deposited on it by Texas rivers. The Balcones Fault is in one of the lowest-risk zones for earthquakes in the United States.

The surface expression of the fault is the Balcones Escarpment, which forms the eastern boundary of the Texas Hill Country and the western boundary of the Texas Coastal Plain, and consists of cliffs and cliff-like structures. Subterranean features such as Wonder Cave and numerous other smaller caves are found along the fault zone.

Many cities are located along this fault zone. Springs such as San Pedro Springs, Comal Springs, San Marcos Springs, Barton Springs, and Salado Springs are found in the fault zone and provide a source of fresh water and a place for human settlement.

The Balcones Fault Zone is a demarcation line for certain ecological systems and for species distributions, e.g., the California fan palm (&quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;) is the only species of palm tree native to the continental United States west of the Balcones Fault.

<text>Lungern is a municipality in the canton of Obwalden in Switzerland. It encompasses Lake Lungern and, besides the village of Lungern, the settlements of Bürglen, Kaiserstuhl and Obsee.

==Geography==

The village of Lungern lies above sea level in the highest part of the canton of Obwalden, on the eastern shore of the Lake of Lungern and at the foot of the Brünig Pass. It is the highest village of the Sarneraa-Valley, in a basin open only to the north and surrounded on all other sides by steep and woody inclinations and rocks.

To the south-west the municipality extends to the Brünig Pass. On its north-western side, the municipal boundary is set by the Wilerhorn and Höch Gumme mountains, and includes the whole of the Lake of Lungern. To the east, the boundary reaches as far as the Hochstollen and Chingstuel mountains, and includes the Güpfi mountain and part of the Kleine Melchtal valley.

Besides the village of Lungern, the municipality includes the settlements of Kaiserstuhl and Bürglen that lie at the northern end of the lake, and Obsee on the south-western end of the lake.

The municipal district of Lungern has an area of , of which are meadow and tilled land, are pastureland, are wooded and the remaining are unproductive.

==History==

The first legal proof of Lungern&#x27;s existence is contained in a tax register for the diocese of the bishop of Konstanz in Germany dating from the year 1275. It is mentioned as &quot;Lutigern&quot; and also as &quot;de Lungern&quot;.



In 1861 it became easier to reach the village with the construction of the old road over the Brünig pass. A quarter century later, in 1886, the first mail carriages came over the pass. However, this only lasted two years, in 1888 the railroad from Brienz to Alpnachstad (now part of Alpnach) opened. In 1887 the Eibach river flooded causing damage to the old village church. Six years later, in 1893, was the consecration of the neo-gothic style church. At the end of the 18th century the population of Lungern lowered the level of the lake, with great effort and over many years, in order to improve living conditions. The works created new land for agriculture, housing, and a sawmill. Within 80 years the hard-won land was lost to a new dam: in 1922 a company named CKW built and started running a power station located at the lake. Nowadays the local power station (EWO) produces electricity from the power of the water of the Lungerersee. In 1942 the railroad line over the Brünig pass was electrified.

==Population and economy==
Nowadays the village of Lungern has about 2120 inhabitants. The population is stable, so there is a rise in the ratio of elderly to total population.

<text>Johann Reichsgraf von Aldringen (sometimes spelled Altringer or Aldringer; 10 December 158822 June 1634) was a Luxemburger who served in the armies of the Spanish Habsburgs and later the Austrian Habsburgs, especially during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Biography==
He was born in Luxembourg in the Duchy of Luxembourg, and after travelling as a nobleman&#x27;s page in France, Italy and the Netherlands, he went to the University of Paris.

In 1606 he entered the service of Spain, in which he remained until 1618, when he joined the imperial army. Here he distinguished himself in the field and in the cabinet. Made a colonel in 1622, two years later he was employed on the Council of War and on diplomatic missions. At the bridge of Dessau in 1626 he performed very distinguished service against Ernst von Mansfeld. He and his constant comrade Matthias Gallas were ennobled on the same day, and in the course of the Italian campaign of 1630 the two officers married the two daughters of Count d&#x27;Arco.

Aldringer served as Count Rambold Collalto&#x27;s major-general in this campaign and was present at the taking of Mantua on 18 July 1630 during the War of Mantuan Succession. The plunder of the duke of Mantua&#x27;s treasures made Gallas and Aldringer wealthy men. Back in Germany in 1631, he served after Breitenfeld as Tilly&#x27;s artillery commander, and, elevated to the dignity of count of the Empire, he was present at the battle of the Lech, where he was wounded.

When Tilly died of his wounds Aldringer succeeded to the command. Made field-marshal after the assault of the Alte Veste near Nuremberg, at which he had been second in command under the Herzog von Friedland (with whom he was a great favourite), he was next placed at the head of the corps formed by Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria to support Wallenstein. In this post his tact and diplomatic ability were put to a severe test in the preservation of harmony between the two dukes. Finally Count Aldringer was won over by the court party which sought to displace the too successful duke of Friedland. After Wallenstein&#x27;s death Aldringer commanded against the Swedes on the Danube, until being killed during the battle of Landshut (22 July 1634). His great possessions descended to his sister, and thence to the family of Clary and Aldringen.

<text>The Texas panhandle is a region of the U.S. state of Texas consisting of the northernmost 26 counties in the state. The panhandle is a square-shaped area bordered by New Mexico to the west and Oklahoma to the north and east. It is adjacent to the Oklahoma Panhandle, land which Texas previously claimed. The 1820 Missouri Compromise declared no slavery would be allowed in states admitted from the Louisiana Purchase above 36°30′ north latitude. Texas was annexed in 1845 from still more westerly land. The Compromise of 1850 removed territory north of this line from Texas, and set the border between the Texas Panhandle and the New Mexico Territory at the 103rd meridian west. The eastern border at the 100th meridian west was inherited from the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, which defined the border between the United States and New Spain. &quot;The Handbook of Texas&quot; defines the southern border of Swisher County as the southern boundary of the Texas Panhandle region.

Its land area is , or nearly 10% of the state&#x27;s total. The Texas Panhandle is slightly larger in size than the US state of West Virginia. An additional is covered by water. Its population as of the 2010 census was 427,927 residents, or 1.7% of the state&#x27;s total population. As of the 2010 census, the population density for the region was . However, more than 72% of the Panhandle&#x27;s residents live in the Amarillo Metropolitan Area, which is the largest and fastest-growing urban area in the region. Despite being geographically the northernmost part of Texas, the Panhandle is distinct from the region commonly called &quot;North Texas&quot;, which is to the south and east.

West of the Caprock Escarpment and North and South of the Canadian River breaks, the surface of the Llano Estacado is rather flat. South of the city of Amarillo, the level terrain gives way to Palo Duro Canyon, the second-largest canyon in the United States. This colorful canyon was carved by the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, a tributary of the Red River. North of Amarillo lies Lake Meredith, a reservoir created by Sanford Dam constructed on the main stem of the Canadian River. Lake Meredith and the Ogallala Aquifer are the primary sources of freshwater in this semi-arid region of the High Plains.

Interstate Highway 40 passes through the Panhandle, and also passes through Amarillo. The freeway passes through Deaf Smith, Oldham, Potter, Carson, Gray, Donley, and Wheeler Counties.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2020, about 434,358 people lived in the Panhandle. Of these, 53.6% were non-Hispanic White, 35.2% were Hispanic, 4.8% were African American, 2.8% were Asian. Only 4.1% were of some other ethnicity. About 92.3% of inhabitants claimed native birth, and 8.9% were veterans of the United States armed forces; 49.9% of the population was male, and 50.1% was female. Around 13.2% of the population was 65 years of age or older, whereas 27.8% of the population was under 18 years of age.

<doc id="317674" wikidata="Q769657" url="?curid=317674" title="Conseil d'État">
<text>In France, the  (; Council of State) is a governmental body that acts both as legal adviser to the executive branch and as the supreme court for administrative justice, which is one of the two branches of the French judiciary system. Established in 1799 by Napoleon as a successor to the King&#x27;s Council (), it is located in the Palais-Royal in Paris and is primarily made up of top-level legal officers. The Vice President of the Council of State ranks as the ninth most important civil servant in France.

Members of the Council of State are part of a Grand Corps of the French State (&quot;Grand corps de l&#x27;État&quot;). The Council of State mainly recruits from among the top-ranking students graduating from the &quot;École nationale d&#x27;administration&quot;.

==Composition==

A General Session of the Council of State is presided over by the Prime Minister or, in their absence, the Minister of Justice. However, since the real presidency of the Council is held by the Vice-President, the Vice President of the Council of State usually presides at all but the most ceremonial assemblies. This is also done for obvious reasons pertaining to the separation of powers.

Other members of the Council include, in decreasing order of importance:
* Department heads (&quot;Présidents de section&quot;)
* Councillors ordinary (&quot;Conseillers d&#x27;État ordinaires&quot;)
* Councillors extraordinary (&quot;Conseillers d&#x27;État en service extraordinaire&quot;)
* Masters of Requests (&quot;Maîtres des requêtes&quot;)
* Master of requests extraordinary (&quot;Maîtres des requêtes en service extraordinaire&quot;)
* Senior masters (&quot;Auditeurs de première classe&quot;)
* Masters (&quot;Auditeurs de deuxième classe&quot;)

The Vice-President of Council of State is appointed by Order-in-Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and is selected from among the Council&#x27;s department heads or councillors ordinary. Division heads are similarly appointed and selected from among the councillors ordinary.

Councillors ordinary, masters of requests, and senior masters are appointed based on seniority from the preceding rank. Appointees from outside the Council may include administrative law judges or may come from outside the justice system.
Masters are recruited from among the graduates of France&#x27;s National Administration Academy. The Council sits in the Palais Royal located in Paris.

The Council is divided into 7 divisions:
* Administrative Claims (&quot;section du contentieux&quot;) — see below.
* Report and Studies (&quot;section du rapport et des études&quot;): writes the annual report, conducts studies and helps to oversee judgments and verdicts are carried out.
* Finances (&quot;section des finances&quot;), the Interior (&quot;section de l&#x27;intérieur&quot;), Welfare and Social Security (&quot;section sociale&quot;), Public Works (&quot;section des travaux publics&quot;) and Administrative Issues (&quot;section de l&#x27;administration&quot;, created by a March 2008 order) review any and all Cabinet-issued orders and statutory instruments and examine and sign off on all Orders of Council (&quot;décrets en Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;). These reviews, though mandatory, are not binding. The Council of State also studies legal issues and problems brought before the Cabinet. In addition, it is responsible for carrying out administrative court inspections.

==History==

The Council of State originates from the 13th century, by which time the King&#x27;s Court (&quot;Curia regis&quot;) had split into three sections, one of which was the King&#x27;s Council (&quot;Curia in consilium&quot;, later &quot;Conseil du roi&quot;), which too broke up into three distinct parts: the &quot;Conseil secret&quot; &#x27;Privy Council&#x27;, the &quot;Conseil privé&quot; &#x27;Private Council&#x27;, and &quot;Conseil des finances&quot; &#x27;Council of Finances&#x27;. Reorganized under Louis XIV into two major groupings, the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État privé, finances et direction&quot; that was the direct ancestor of the Council of State. It brought together legal advisors and experts to advise the King on claims against the Crown. Officially established in 1557, this was the largest of the King&#x27;s Councils made up of France&#x27;s High Chancellor, lords of peerage, Ministers and Secretaries of State, the Comptroller-General, 30 Councillors of State, 80 masters of requests, and the Intendants of Finance. The judicial portion of the Council was known as the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État privé&quot; or &quot;Conseil des parties&quot;.

French kings had the power to dispense justice and hand down judgments as the court of last resort and delegated this judicial power to royal courts and parlements. But the French king still retained the power to override them at will. Specifically, French kings maintained their privilege to decide major issues and hand down judgment when administrative acts were in dispute. The judgments of the King&#x27;s Council of State were regarded as being issued under the King&#x27;s residual proper jurisdiction (&quot;justice retenue&quot;), that is, the sovereign&#x27;s reserved power to dispense justice in certain matters. Legal advisors also assisted the King in developing new laws and, by delegated jurisdiction, directly exercised sovereign rights (&quot;jura regalia&quot;).

&quot;For more on French government administration during the Old Regime, see Ancien Régime in France.&quot;

The French Consulate government established the current Council of State in 1799 as a judicial body to adjudicate claims against the State and assist in the drafting of important laws. The First Consul (later Emperor) presided over Council sessions, and the Council performed many of the functions of a Cabinet. After the Bourbon Restoration, the Council was retained as an administrative court but without its former prominence. Its role was more precisely defined by an 1872 Act of Parliament.

The Council of State was originally a court of first instance and last instance, but since the creation of the in 1953 and the in 1987, it has increasingly become a supervisory court, with a role as an appeal court in a small number of areas. The Council of State hears appeals on questions of law from lower courts and gives advisory opinions on the law on reference from lower courts. Below it are 42 administrative courts of first instance (&quot;tribunaux administratifs&quot;) and 8 administrative courts of appeal (&quot;cours administratives d&#x27;appel&quot;).

==Advisory role==
Certain types of statutory instruments must be examined by the Council and receive its advisory approval, including:
* All draft legislation proposed by non-parliamentary members and prior to being introduced before Parliament.
* Orders-in-council, signed by the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers; any such order is a form of delegated legislation outlining how a statute or act of Parliament is to be carried out or put into effect. Typically, a statutory law will authorize, prescribe, or prohibit an action defined in broad terms and require a government order to define its scope and application.

The Council&#x27;s advisory workload is divided between its administrative sections with respect to the ministry or department affected by the government order.

==Administrative justice==
The Council acts as the supreme court of appeal for administrative law courts. It hears both claims against national-level administrative decisions (notably orders, rules, regulations and decisions of the executive branch) and appeals from lower administrative courts. The Council&#x27;s decisions are final and unappealable.

While strictly speaking the Council of State is not a court, it functions as a judicial body by adjudicating suits and claims against administrative authorities. Plaintiffs are represented by barristers drawn from the Senior Court bar whose members are licensed to argue cases before the Council and Court of Cassation; any such barrister bears the title of Counsel at Senior Court (&quot;Avocat aux Conseils&quot;).

===Original jurisdiction===
The Council hears cases against decisions of the national government, notably government orders, ministerial rules and regulations, judgments handed down by committees, commissions, and boards with nationwide jurisdiction, as well as suits concerning regional and EU electoral matters.

The Council has judged that such acts are restricted to:
* relationships between the executive branch and the legislative branch, e.g., whether a bill should be submitted to Parliament;
* acts that are part and parcel of France&#x27;s foreign policy.
In this role, the Council provides a powerful check on the actions of the executive.

===Appellate jurisdiction===
The Council of State has appellate jurisdiction over local election judgments from any of the 37 administrative courts.

It acts as a final court of cassation for decisions originating from any of the eight appellate administrative courts, meaning that it hears cases in which the plaintiff argues that the appellate court ignored or misinterpreted the law. Should it decide that the original appellate court took the wrong decision, the Council of State will in most situations transfer the case to a different administrative court of appeal, to be re-judged. However, in the interest of swifter decision-making and correct interpretation of the law (&quot;bonne administration de la justice&quot;), it also has the right to rule on the case without transferring it, thus acting as an appellate court of last resort (&quot;jugement en dernier ressort&quot;).

===Court procedure===
Like nearly all French courts, the Council&#x27;s court system is inquisitorial, and proceedings are initiated by a statement of claim detailing the factual background of the case and why the appellant should be granted relief. The Council then begins a formal investigation, asking the appellee, i.e., the government or a government agency or office, to satisfy the Council with a detailed statement of defense. Burden of proof does not lie with the plaintiff; instead, the Council decides whether or not the appellant has cause to bring suit and whether the government was in error if information provided by the appellant is sufficient to locate previously undisclosed evidence. Of course, both parties may submit additional pleadings and information until the case is ready for final judgment.

The formation of judgement depends on the importance of the case, for the jurisprudence and the interest of the law. All of the formations belong to the Administrative Claims department.

The smaller cases (without new legal issues) are treated by one chamber (known as under-departments, i.e. &quot;sous-section&quot;, prior to their reorganization in 2016). There are 10 chambers. The bigger cases are attributed to united chambers (&quot;chambres réunies&quot;), a configuration made up of two chambers, although, for some important fiscal cases, three or four chambers can be concerned, coalescing into an &quot;ad hoc&quot; formation, the &quot;full fiscal&quot; (&quot;plénière fiscale&quot;) chamber. 
The more important cases are for the &quot;administrative claims department&quot; judgement formation (&quot;Section&quot;). Only the very important cases, with hard, new and/or important legal issues are concerned. There are about between 20 and 40 cases per year into this specific formation, which includes the president of the ten chambers, the three assistant-presidents of the administrative claims department and the president of the department, which, in addition to the magistrate responsible of the investigation about the case, reaches 15 members.

The major cases are resolved by the &quot;administrative claims assembly&quot; (&quot;Assemblée du contentieux&quot;). All the presidents of departments are there, under the presidency of the Vice-President of the Council of State. Less than 10 cases per year are concerned.

All the cases, even the ones eventually resolved by the &quot;Assemblée du contentieux&quot;, are first studied by a chamber.

Although, as is the general rule in French administrative law, the procedure is written, one of its highlights are the oral &quot;conclusion&quot; of the &quot;rapporteur public&quot; (public magistrate), giving his personal vision of the case, totally impartial and free, on a pure legal point of view. Reading the conclusions from past cases is often useful to understand the mindset of the judges and the reason of the solution given to the case. Nonetheless, and unlike in common law jurisdictions operating under stare decisis, those former judgements do not constitute a binding precedent for French judges, who remain free to adapt or overturn them (in a so-called &quot;renversement de jurisprudence&quot;).

Since an order of 2009 (n° 2009–14, 7 January 2009), there is a possibility for the parties to speak after the &quot;rapporteur public&quot;&#x27;s conclusions. Lawyers use this possibility only for major cases, when it can make a significant difference (e.g. for the &quot;Hoffmann-Gleman&quot; case – 16 February 2009 – concerning the compensation of the daughter of a deported Jew during the World War II, involving the French state&#x27;s responsibility).

In some cases, there may be some confusion as to whether a case should be heard before an administrative law court or judicial court, in which case the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes, or &quot;tribunal des conflits&quot;, made up of an even number of State councillors and Supreme Judicial Court justices, is convened to decide to whom the matter shall be vested. Until 2015, this Court was chaired by the Minister of Justice, whose vote would break any potential tie. As of 2015, court members elect a president amongst themselves for 3 years, and, in case of a tie, the court&#x27;s composition can be modified to include several more judges.

===Major rulings of the Council of State===

Exercising judicial review over almost all acts of the executive branch, the Council of State&#x27;s judgments may be of considerable importance, often not for the actual case judged, but for their importance in shaping legal interpretation. While France is a civil law country and there is no formal rule of precedent (stare decisis), lower courts follow the &quot;jurisprudence constante&quot; doctrine with regard to the Council of State. The Council&#x27;s major rulings are collected into law reports and commented on by scholars; the Council&#x27;s official website carries a list of comments on important decisions. The Council has shaped its own legal doctrine which consists mostly of principles deduced from cases but incorporates considerable jurisprudence derived from statutes.

Rulings are named for the moving parties (appellants) in the cases and under highly formal courtesy titles. Men&#x27;s names used to be preceded by &quot;Sieur&quot;, women&#x27;s names by &quot;Dame&quot; or &quot;Demoiselle&quot;, and widows were referred to as &quot;Dame veuve&quot;.

About 10,000 rulings per year are given by the Council of State.

The most important rulings are collected in a publication called &quot;G.A.J.A&quot; (i.e. &quot;Les Grands Arrêts de la Jurisprudence Administrative&quot; – The major rulings of the administrative jurisprudence -), published by Dalloz editions and written by some of the most influential authors or judges of the time in France (e.g. Bruno Genevois or Prosper Weil). The GAJA explains about 120 rulings, from 1873 to now, and quotes several hundreds of other important rulings.

Important rulings include:

* February 19, 1875 – Prince Napoléon&lt;br&gt;The fact that a decision has been taken with political considerations does not make it an &quot;act of government&quot; that cannot be adjudicated by the Council ( a previous doctrine). A prince had been removed from the Army for political reasons. The Council stated that his case had to be heard, but then decided that it was unfounded because the law said that his commission could be revoked.
* May 28, 1954 – Barel. &quot;Freedom of opinion of civil servants.&quot;&lt;br&gt; After a number of Communists had been refused admission to the École nationale d&#x27;administration it was decided that the Government cannot exclude people from applying for civil service positions solely on the basis of their political convictions.
* October 19, 1962 – Canal, Robin &amp; Godot&lt;br&gt;The executive branch may make decisions by ordinance only within a narrowly defined scope authorised by the enabling law. The executive cannot mandate the creation of courts whose procedures and lack of recourse fall outside the general principles of criminal law.&lt;br&gt;This decision was the source of tensions between the Council and then President Charles De Gaulle.
* February 3, 1989 – Alitalia corporation&lt;br&gt;The executive branch is responsible for voiding its own unlawful rules and regulations, even if they were initially lawful. Regulatory law must comply with European Union directives in force.
* October 27, 1995 – Commune of Morsang-sur-Orge, also known commonly as the &quot;dwarf tossing case&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Respect for human dignity is to be included as part of the &quot;ordre public&quot; (the principles governing the public realm in France). In this case a mayor had prohibited a dwarf-tossing event on the grounds was against the &quot;public interest&quot; because it did not respect human dignity. This decision stops short of including morality as part of the &quot;ordre public&quot;.
* October 30, 1998 - Sarran, Levacher et autres&lt;br&gt;The French Constitution prevails on international treaties, including European treaties. The Constitution is the supreme norm, above all other law rules. 
* March 3, 2004 – The asbestos case.&lt;br&gt;The State may be held responsible for not taking appropriate measures, in accordance with current scientific knowledge, to safeguard workers&#x27; health (against asbestos), even if workers are employed by private employers.
* October 3, 2008 - Commune d&#x27;Annecy&lt;br&gt;As the Charter for the Environment is cited in the preamble of the French Constitution, all the rights and duties it defines have constitutional value.

==French Institute of Administrative Sciences==

The Council of State is linked to the French Institute of Administrative Sciences (IFSA). The vice-president of the Council of State is the president of the IFSA and its main members are state counselors.
In 2009, the Council of State hosted IFSA&#x27;s annual conference which was organized on the theme: &quot;public security: partnership between public power and private sector.&quot;

<text>Engelberg (lit.: &quot;mountain of angel(s)&quot;) is a village resort and a municipality in the canton of Obwalden in Switzerland. Alongside the central village of Engelberg, the municipality encompasses additional settlements, including Grafenort, Oberberg and Schwand.

The municipality of Engelberg is an exclave, entirely encircled by the neighboring cantons of Bern, Nidwalden and Uri.

Engelberg is a mountain resort in Central Switzerland. In the Middle Ages, the area garnered recognition for its Benedictine monastery, known as Engelberg Abbey. As time progressed, particularly from the 19th century onwards, Engelberg became a well-known mountain resort. The city of Lucerne serves as the nearest major urban center.

While the official language of Engelberg is Swiss German, the predominant spoken language is the local variation of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

==History==
Engelberg&#x27;s earliest mention dates to 1122, denoted as Engilperc, concurrent with the founding of the Abbey. Prior to this, the Alpine pasture of Trüebsee was already collectively utilized by the locals.

In August 1815, as Nidwalden hesitated in accepting the Federal Treaty, Engelberg promptly expressed its support. Federal troops entered Nidwalden, ultimately prompting their acceptance of the treaty on 18 August 1815. Consequently, Engelberg was incorporated into the canton of Obwalden.

The mid-19th century ushered in Engelberg&#x27;s emergence as a vacation destination, known for its therapeutic mineral water, milk serum and fresh air. The efforts of families such as Cattani, Hess, and Odermatt led to the establishment of a number of hotels, cementing the region&#x27;s status as a tourist destination. Related developments included the construction of a broader road between 1872 and 1874, as well as the inauguration of the Stansstad-Engelberg electric railway in 1898.

Engelberg&#x27;s reputation as a hub for hiking and other mountain activities grew toward the end of the 19th century. The winter season made its debut in 1903-1904. The Gerschnialpbahn, a funicular railway (unveiled in 1913), connected Engelberg to Gerschni with a subsequent cable car (inaugurated in 1927) extending the journey to Ober Trüebsee. The pre-World War I era was characterized by robust growth, as indicated by a substantial influx of visitors (165,922 visitor-nights in 1911). The expansion of roadways and the extension of the railway to Lucerne (achieved in 1964) enhanced the accessibility of Engelberg. Further advancements were marked by the opening of the higher segment of the Titlis cable car in 1967. Over time, Engelberg&#x27;s appeal extended beyond tourism, hosting regular conferences. By the turn of the millennium, the tertiary sector, particularly tourism, contributed significantly to employment in Engelberg.

== Geography ==

Engelberg is situated within the Uri Alps mountain range.

Engelberg is surrounded by several mountain summits, such as Titlis in the south () above sea level), the Walenstöcke () and Ruchstock () to the north, Hahnen () and Wissberg () to the east, the Engelberger Rotstock () and the Wissigstock () to the northeast, and the upper valley of the Engelberger Aa leading to the Surenen Pass () leading to the Urner Reusstal.

Engelberg has an area (as of the 2004/09 survey) of . Of this area, about 27.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 25.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 3.7% is settled (buildings or roads) and 43.5% is unproductive land. In the 2013/18 survey a total of or about 1.9% of the total area was covered with buildings, an increase of over the 1980/81 amount. Over the same time period, the amount of recreational space in the municipality increased by and is now about 0.61% of the total area. Of the agricultural land, is fields and grasslands and consists of alpine grazing areas. Since 1980/81 the amount of agricultural land has decreased by . Over the same time period the amount of forested land has increased by . Rivers and lakes cover in the municipality.

The average altitude of Engelberg is . However the village is surrounded by the Alps, creating very steep terrain. The highest point in the borders of the municipality is the Titlis. The Engelberg Valley () is drained by the Engelberger Aa, a tributary of Lake Lucerne. The valley is located southwards from the lake.

== Transport ==
The municipality of Engelberg is served by two stations on the Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line. Engelberg railway station is located in the village and is the terminus of the line. Grafenort station is to the north, one station away. Both stations are served by hourly InterRegio trains from the city of Lucerne.

A free bus system provides daytime transport within the village, with a network of seven routes during the winter season (from December through to April) and a single route during the summer season (from April until October).

Drahtseilbahn Engelberg–Hotel Terrasse, a funicular from the village to Hotel Terrace operated from 1905 to 2008, with some interruptions. Gerschnialpbahn opened in 1913.

== Tourism ==
The tourist activities in the village and surrounding area include skiing and other snow sports in the winter season, and hiking and mountain activities during the summer.

In the village itself the main sights are the Benedictine monastery Engelberg Abbey which incorporates a cheese factory and demonstration shop, the Talmuseum showing the history of the area and Swiss rural life, and a number of old chapels.

The winter sports season generally lasts from December until April, although the high altitude glacier areas on the Titlis can sometimes be used (by advanced skiers) from October until May. Snow coverage is generally reliable, although in recent years artificial snow machines have been installed on some of the lower altitude runs in order to improve snow cover.
Engelberg hosts a round of the ski jumping World Cup at the Gross-Titlis-Schanze jump.
In common with the rest of Switzerland, there is a village celebration for Swiss National Day on 1 August, with parades and events throughout the day.
On the last Saturday in September the &quot;Alpabzug&quot; takes place, when the cattle are brought from the mountain pastures back to their winter barns in the village and valley.

There are three main mountain areas, accessible from the village, offering various activities in winter and summer. The cable cars generally run all year round, providing access for hikers and mountain bikers as well as skiers.

=== Titlis ===
The Titlis in the south of Engelberg at above sea level is the highest summit of the range north of the Susten Pass, between the Bernese Oberland and Central Switzerland.

The Titlis mountain massif is accessible by cable cars of the Titlis Bergbahnen. The cable car bottom station is also the central terminus of the village bus services. A funicular railway (dating from 1913) runs up to station &quot;Gerschnialp&quot; () and a wide Alpine pasture called Gerschni, with easy snow areas suitable for beginners and cross country ski trails, and a toboggan run leading back down to the valley station. In the summer there are two cheese dairies, with walking trails leading up to Ober Trüebsee and back down to the village, or level trails leading to Unter Trüebsee to the west.

The &quot;Titlis Xpress&quot; gondola lift, opened in 2015 to replace an older one dating from the 1970s, runs from the valley station () up to the middle station &quot;Trübsee&quot; () and on to &quot;Stand&quot; (). This area provides more challenging skiing, on the lower slopes of the Titlis and via further chair lifts to the Jochpass () and below the Jochstock at . A continuous ski piste leads down to Unter Trüebsee and back to the cable car valley station. In summer the lake is a destination for walkers, with rowing boats available on the lake and picnic places around it. Walking routes lead over the Jochpass to Engstlenalp and Melchsee-Frutt, or directly from Engleberg over the Juchli Pass () or Storegg Pass ()) into the Melchtal.

The &quot;Rotair&quot; cable car (&quot;the world&#x27;s first rotating cable car&quot;) runs up to the &quot;Kleintitlis&quot; mountain station () where there is a restaurant and shops, an observation terrace and access to the glacier and summit. The high altitude glacier runs down from the peak are suitable for advanced skiers, with off-piste routes leading down to &quot;Trüebsee&quot; and the &quot;Laubersgrat&quot; ridge.

=== Brunni ===
The Brunni mountain area, to the north of the village, is accessible from the cable car station which runs up to &quot;Ristis&quot; (), with a further chair lift up to &quot;Brunnihütte&quot; (). The ski runs here are of a beginner to medium standard, although sometimes not having so much snow cover as the Titlis side due to the south facing aspect. There is another toboggan run from &quot;Brunnihütte&quot; back down to &quot;Ristis&quot;. In summer there are a number of walking trails starting from here, including the &quot;Walenpfad&quot; leading to Bannalp and the &quot;Rot Grätli&quot; ridge across the mountains to the north and northeast. There are also a number of prepared rock climbing routes ().

=== Fürenalp ===
At the eastern end of the Engelberg valley, there is a cable car up to Fürenalp (), passing over the &quot;Fürenwand&quot; rock climbing area. From the top station or from the valley, summer walking routes with views of the Chli Spannort () and Gross Spannort () mountain peaks lead to the Surenenpass () in the east.

===Heritage sites===
Engelberg is home to three sites that are Swiss heritage sites of national significance; Engelberg Abbey with its library, archives and music collection, the mansion (Herrenhaus) in Grafenort and the Holy Cross chapel in Grafenort.

<text>The UCPH Department of Mathematical Sciences () is a department under the Faculty of Science at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). The department is based at the university&#x27;s North Campus in Copenhagen.

==Location==
The department is located in the E building of the Hans Christian Ørsted Institute, on Universitetsparken 5 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

From the founding of the University of Copenhagen in 1479, mathematics had been part of the Faculty of Philosophy. In 1850 it was moved to the new faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The Institute for Mathematical Sciences was first created in 1934 next to the Niels Bohr Institute building, when Carlsberg Foundation donated money for a building in celebration of the 450th anniversary of the University of Copenhagen in 1929. In 1963 the institute moved to its current location.

==Mathematical research==
Many different branches of mathematics are being covered by the fields of interest of different researchers at the institute.

Harald Bohr, the brother of physicist Niels Bohr, is one famous alumnus of the department; his research in harmonic analysis and almost periodic functions in the 1930s laid the foundation for a huge drive in analysis. Most notably, since the 1980s the department has been a globally recognized frontrunner in functional analysis, particularly the study of operator algebras and C*-algebras.
Faculty from the department who have contributed to this research include the following:
* Bent Fuglede
* Søren Eilers
* George Elliott
* Gert Kjærgaard Pedersen
* Ryszard Nest
* Richard V. Kadison

Contributing to these efforts, the department houses a center for non-commutative geometry.

Of other major research frontiers are homological algebra, and more recently - grounds have been laid for a boost in the research of algebraic topology.

<doc id="317677" wikidata="Q553849" url="?curid=317677" title="Matthias Gallas">
<text>Matthias Gallas, Graf von Campo und Herzog von Lucera (Count of Campo, Duke of Lucera) (Matteo Gallasso; 17 October 1588 in Trento – 25 April 1647 in Vienna) was an Italian professional soldier during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He distinguished himself in the first half of the war in service of the Catholic League, in the War of the Mantuan Succession, and as one of Albrecht von Wallenstein&#x27;s Generals. After carrying out the dismissal and elimination of Wallenstein, Gallas became acting supreme commander of the Imperial Army three times between 1634 and 1647 but he never held the function or authority of a Generalissimo.

He was a principal architect of the victory of Nördlingen 1634 but his following campaigns were less successful. After leading ineffective offensives against France, he managed to end Swedish attacks on Saxony and to drive them back to the Baltic coast in 1637. Unable to eliminate them or sustain his own forces in the devastated Pomerania, Gallas retreated with his shrunken army in 1638. Because he was unable to stop the following Swedish advance, he lost his command for the first time.

Called back in 1643 to stop Lennart Torstensson who soon retreated to attack Denmark, Gallas was ordered to follow him and to support the Danes. This ended in Gallas&#x27; most disastrous campaign in which he was outmaneuvered and encircled by the Swedes, who cut him off from his supplies in late 1644. Having lost almost his entire army, he was again relieved from command, only to return to advise and support Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in defending the Erblande against Sweden. Once again, he replaced the Archduke as supreme commander in 1647 but died soon afterwards after suffering many years from ill health.

==Biography==
=== Early career ===
Gallas started his career first as page and then as cavalryman in service of Ferdinando Madruzzo, a brother of the Prince-Bishop of Trento Carlo Gaudenzio Madruzzo. He most likely fought as Spanish mercenary in Flanders. Thereafter, he fought as Fähnrich and Lieutenant under the Tyrolean &quot;Obristfeldhauptmann&quot; Giannangelo Madruzzo for Spain against Savoy. In 1616, Gallas participated at the Spanish siege of Vercelli in Piedmont. Following Giannangelo&#x27;s death in December 1618, Gallas was designated to succeed him as commander of the fortress Riva. He became Captain and commanded the fortress until January 1621. In this year, Gallas joined the forces of the Catholic League and entered the Thirty Years&#x27; War as &quot;Obristwachtmeister&quot; and commander of an infantry regiment. He was second officer to Count Anholt and distinguished himself, especially at the battle of Stadtlohn (1623). After being promoted to colonel in 1625 and made Reichsfreiherr in 1627, the League president and Bavarian Elector Maximilian denied him further promotion, leading to Gallas&#x27; change into Imperial service in early 1629.
Since 1629, he was serving as Generalfeldwachtmeister under Count Collalto in the War of Mantuan succession. When Collalto fell sick, command of the Imperial army devolved to his deputies, Gallas and Johann von Aldringen. 

On 29 May 1630, Gallas successfully defeated a 17,000 strong Franco-Venetian relief army led by the French general Duc de Candale and the Venetian provveditore Zaccaria Sagredo at the battle of Villabuona. His complete victory at Villabuona ensured the fall of Mantua, and on 18 July Imperial troops under his command captured and then brutally sacked the city. Only the churches and the ghetto were spared, but the latter solely to expel the Jewish population and to plunder it nine days later. The expulsion was later rescinded by the Imperial court, and on 18 October the surviving Jewish population of Mantua was allowed to return. Gallas stayed in Italy to negotiate the Treaty of Cherasco in which he managed to prevent the demilitarisation of the Valtellina that remained under Imperial control.

Made Imperial Count for the capture of Mantua and the negotiations at Cherasco, he returned to Germany for the campaign against the invading swedish king Gustavus Adolphus and his Saxon allies in late 1631. Gallas was appointed to Feldzeugmeister and assumed command over a corps of Wallenstein&#x27;s army. Over the winter, he recovered parts of Bohemia from Saxon occupation. Wallenstein&#x27;s army recaptured Prague and subsequently turned to Bavaria to face the Swedish army in 1632. Gallas&#x27; corps served at the Battle of the Alte Veste near Nuremberg against the Swedish King. After the battle, Gallas was promoted to Field Marshal. Wallenstein sent him to Silesia prior to the Battle of Lützen and called him back too late, so that he did not arrive in time to participate. On a proposal from Wallenstein, Emperor Ferdinand II appointed Gallas to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot;, second-in-command to the Generalissimo. Over the year 1633, he commanded in Silesia.

When Wallenstein&#x27;s repeated disobedience and unauthorized negotiations with Saxony strengthened the court&#x27;s mistrust of him, the Imperial counselor Wolkenstein contacted Gallas to check his loyalty and to introduce him to plans to depose Wallenstein. Initially skeptical of the plans, he unsuccessfully tried to change Wallenstein&#x27;s mind. He was made provisional supreme commander until the Emperor&#x27;s son Ferdinand of Hungary took command. 

After he was informed of the Emperor&#x27;s decision to arrest or kill Wallenstein, Gallas left the army&#x27;s headquarters in Pilsen on 12 February 1634 to plan the execution. He declared the orders of Wallenstein, Adam Erdmann Trčka von Lípa and Christian von Ilow invalid and secured the loyalty of the troops while Wallenstein fled to Eger where he was assassinated. Gallas was rewarded with the vast majority of the former Duchy of Friedland.

=== Generalleutnant and Imperial commander ===

In the next campaign, Gallas was the actual commander as chief advisor to the inexperienced Ferdinand of Hungary. Their plan was to regain Regensburg and to link up with a Spanish army under the Cardinal-Infante. The Imperials captured Regensburg on 26 July, followed by Donauwörth on 16 August. They proceeded to besiege Nördlingen where the Spanish army joined their forces. A numerically inferior Swedish force under Gustav Horn and Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar tried to lift the siege and attacked them on 5 September but Gallas directed the united Habsburg army to a resounding victory in the Battle of Nördlingen. The Swedes lost two armies and the control over southern Germany while the Imperials chased them up to the Main before moving into winter quarters in Württemberg.

The attention of the Imperials turned to the Rhine in 1635. After the open outbreak of hostilities with France, Gallas and his troops crossed the river at the recently captured Philippsburg in May. He captured most of the Palatinate with Kaiserslautern as well as Worms and started to besiege Mainz in summer. At the approach of a French-Weimar relief force under Bernhard and Cardinal La Valette, Gallas retreated to harass them with light cavalry and to cut off their supplies. This proved successful, most of the French army perished because of sickness or hunger, or it dissolved on its retreat to Metz. The siege of Mainz was renewed and successfully concluded in December while Gallas advanced via Saarbrücken into Lorraine. He joined forces at Dieuze with the exiled Duke of Lorraine who urged to recapture his capital Nancy. Yet Gallas preferred to entrench his army at the Seille to give his troops some rest. An outbreak of the plague and shortage of supplies forced him to retreat into Alsace where he set up winter quarters at Saverne.
For 1636, Ferdinand of Hungary had convinced the Cardinal-Infante to invade France from the north in an attempt to end the war. Gallas was ordered to lead a separate southern invasion into Burgundy to support Spain. Despite Gallas&#x27; reluctance to initiate offensive campaigns, he collected his troops in Breisach and marched via the Belfort Gap into the Franche-Comté. French troops had invaded this Habsburg territory in May and were besieging the capital Dole. Gallas sent his vanguard under Guillaume de Lamboy and the Duke of Lorraine ahead; they relieved Dole in August. His main force encamped at Champlitte where it was confronted by a French army under Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and La Valette in September. Unwilling to attack the French head-on, Gallas broke up his camp after several weeks and marched on Dijon. After capturing the castle of Mirebeau-sur-Bèze on 24 October, he was again hesitant to advance further and decided to lay siege to Saint-Jean-de-Losne to secure its strategic bridge for supplies or a possible retreat. However, the small town resisted all Imperial attacks until French reinforcements and heavy rain forced Gallas to abandon the siege and the overall invasion in early November.

After being sent to northern Germany with his army in 1637, Gallas was more successful at stopping the advance of the Swedish general Johan Banér. He almost encircled the Swedes at Torgau with superior numbers in June but Banér escaped by sacrificing parts of his baggage. In a pursuit up to Pomerania, Gallas was faster than Banér and blocked his way at Landsberg. Banér barely rescued his army by deceiving the Imperials into thinking that he would violate Polish neutrality and evacuate his army over their territory. However, he only sent his remaining baggage over the Polish border, while his troops moved westwards across the Oder. Gallas trapped him at the coastline and raised a cordon along the Peene river, taking all strongholds except the most heavily fortified, such as Stralsund or Stettin. The Swedes apparently showed readiness for peace, as their main army was locked in a few fortresses on the Baltic Sea. The new Emperor Ferdinand III was willing to compromise but the Swedish Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna eventually used his offers just to improve the French contributions in the Treaty of Hamburg in March 1638.

During 1638, Gallas&#x27; situation strongly deteriorated; while Banér received fresh reinforcements from Sweden, Gallas gained only insignificant support from his allies Brandenburg-Prussia and Saxony. In October 1638, Banér broke through Gallas&#x27; cordon and reconquered Mecklenburg. The Imperials were unable to sustain their army in the devastated area any longer and first retreated across the Elbe, then to Silesia, plundering and partially dissolving in the progress. After Gallas&#x27; retreat, Banér pushed into Saxony, defeating the Saxon army at Chemnitz in April 1639. The Swedes advanced even further entering Bohemia in May as the first enemy since 1634. At first left in command, Gallas focused on defending Prague against Swedish siege attempts. Unable to expel the Swedes from Bohemia and confronted with declining army morale and discipline, Gallas was replaced by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in September. The emperor wanted Gallas to stay as counselor in Vienna, but he chose to return to Trento and to administer his various possessions for the next few years.

=== Return as commander ===
In March 1643, Gallas returned to succeed the Archduke and the interim commander Piccolomini who both resigned following their defeat at Breitenfeld. Gallas anticipated the march of the Swedes under Lennart Torstensson from Saxony to Moravia and tried to block his way with a defensive position at Hradec Králové as well as denying the Swedes any crossing of the Elbe. However, Torstensson feinted an attack at Brandeis while gaining a crossing at Mělník. This allowed Torstensson to reach Moravia and resupply the occupied Olomouc. Gallas followed him over Brno and again took a strong defensive position in front of Torstensson. Instead of seeking battle, Gallas harassed him in skirmishes with the superior Imperial light cavalry and sent a diversion under Krockow to Pomerania. At the end of the year, the Swedes surprisingly left to attack Denmark in what became the Torstenson War.
In the next year, Gallas was ordered to march to Holstein to Denmark&#x27;s aid. Being himself very skeptical about the prospects of this campaign, he delayed his departure until May and slowly moved up to Kiel that he recaptured from Sweden in August. The Swedish fleet had been trapped in the Bay of Kiel after the Battle of Colberger Heide but Gallas arrived a few days too late to bombard it from land. Torstensson was already in control of Jutland and bypassed Gallas&#x27; army after a short confrontation at the Eider to threaten their supply lines. Gallas was forced to retreat back to Bernburg where Torstensson&#x27;s superior cavalry supported by Hans Christoff von Königsmarck fully encircled the Imperials and denied them any supplies. By deceiving Torstensson to attack a small decoy force, Gallas was able to escape to Magdeburg in November where the pattern repeated itself. His army been shrunken by hunger, sickness and desertion, and himself fallen ill, Gallas ordered his troops to break out. The cavalry under Adrian von Enkevort and Raimondo Montecuccoli was caught by the Swedes at Jüterbog and only partly escaped, the small remaining portion of infantry under Johann Wilhelm von Hunolstein safely reached Bohemia in early February 1645.

Gallas himself stayed with the diseased soldiers in Magdeburg and only returned to Prague in late February. His command was given to Melchior von Hatzfeldt who lost and was captured at Jankau in March. The slightly recovered Gallas was again recalled to assist the new Generalissimo Leopold Wilhelm as his deputy. He collected the dispersed Imperial troops in Bohemia and organised the defence of the kingdom whereas Archduke Leopold Wilhelm held the Danube. The Bavarian defeat by France at Second Nördlingen in August made an Imperial diversion necessary to help them out. Both Gallas and the Archduke moved to Bavaria and repulsed the French army back to the Rhine while the defence of the Danube was left to three army corps under Puchheim, Hunolstein and Annibale Gonzaga. When Gallas&#x27; health and his relationship to the Archduke strongly declined at the end of the year, he left his office again.

Feeling somewhat more in health, Gallas was asked to replace the Archduke as supreme commander in December 1646. Despite arguing for Piccolomini instead of him, Gallas agreed. Soon, he was again afflicted by gout and fever. Too ill to lead another campaign, he restricted his efforts to conserve the Imperial army through the winter. The war-weary Gallas could not prevent the Bavarian Elector Maximilian from signing the Truce of Ulm with France and Sweden in March 1647; he even admitted that Maximilian was doing the right thing. The emperor recalled Gallas to Vienna in late March, his command was transferred to Count Holzappel on 17 April. Gallas died eight days later due to a failed surgery.

==Assessment==
The successes of Gallas&#x27; early career were not matched by his achievements after 1634. He was a general that never lost a major battle because he did not lead his army into any after Nördlingen. Unwilling to risk his army in pitched battle, Gallas still could not prevent the ruin of his armies in various campaigns because of lack of supplies. He often complained about the unsustainable conditions but still obediently followed the orders of the emperor. After his disastrous campaigns of 1638 and 1644, he became even known as the “destroyer of armies” - originating from French and Swedish war propaganda, it evolved into a lasting nickname.

According to his biographer Rebitsch, Gallas was an able and wily tactician who most excelled in the defence but often lacked the determination and risk appetite in the offensive. He was competent in the operative planning of his campaigns but more and more overstrained in their execution under the increasingly difficult external conditions of the later Thirty Years&#x27; War. Gallas was in contrast to for example Torstensson or Piccolomini not among the commanders that could adequately adapt to these altered conditions.

==Family==
Gallas first married Countess Isabella of Arco in 1630 in a double marriage with his colleague Johann von Aldringen who married Isabella&#x27;s sister Livia. After the death of his first wife in 1632, Gallas remarried two years later to Countess Dorothea Anna Maria von Lodron-Laterano (1619-1666), daughter of Count Philipp von Lodron-Laterano (1596-1671) and a relative to Salzburg&#x27;s Prince-Bishop Paris von Lodron. Together, they had at least seven children, of which Franz Ferdinand (1635–1697), Theresia Annunziata Francesca († 1667), Anton Pankraz (1638–1695) and Maria Viktoria (1639–1687) survived their childhood. After the death of her husband, Dorothea married Prince Ferdinand Johann von und zu Liechtenstein (1622-1666). The most remarkable descendant of Gallas was his grandson Johann Wenzel von Gallas (1669–1719), a diplomat and Austrian Viceroy of Naples.

After the death of the last male Gallas in 1757, Johann Wenzel&#x27;s son Philipp Josef, the heir Christian Philipp von Clam took the name Clam-Gallas, a family which provided many reputable soldiers to the Imperial army.

==Possessions==

Despite holding the title &quot;Count of Campo&quot;, Gallas never possessed the eponymous Castle Campo near Fiavé that his family had lost many generations before. From his pay as soldier and officer, he purchased the first pieces of land prior to 1621, followed by a house in Trento in 1623 and a mansion in Mattarello in 1628. In 1632 or 1642, he bought the Palazzo Fugger in Trento, afterwards known as Palazzo Galasso.

His loyalty to the Habsburgs during Wallenstein&#x27;s dismissal in early 1634 brought Gallas as highest-ranking executor the majority of the Generalissimo&#x27;s property in the Bohemian Duchy of Friedland with Frýdlant and Liberec but without the capital Jičín. From Adam Trčka&#x27;s possessions, the dominion of Smiřice was given to Gallas. In northern Italy, he purchased Castle Freyenthurn () in Mattarello and most of the surrounding village from 1634 to 1636.

On 22 August 1635, Gallas was made Duke of Lucera by King Philip IV of Spain. The title was linked to a territory in the Kingdom of Naples. Gallas himself did not use the title in documents or correspondence.

<text>Anton Ludwig Friedrich August Mackensen (ennobled as von Mackensen in 1899; 6 December 1849 – 8 November 1945), was a German field marshal. He commanded Army Group Mackensen during World War I (1914–1918) and became one of the German Empire&#x27;s most prominent and competent military leaders. After the armistice of 11 November 1918, the victorious Allies interned Mackensen in Serbia for a year. In 1920, he retired from the army. In 1933 Hermann Göring made him a Prussian state councillor. During the Nazi era (1933–1945), Mackensen remained a committed monarchist and sometimes appeared at official functions in his World War I uniform. Senior Nazi Party members suspected him of disloyalty, but nothing was proven against him.

==Early life and career==

Mackensen was born in Haus Leipnitz, near the village of Dahlenberg (today part of Trossin) in the Prussian Province of Saxony, to Ludwig and Marie Louise Mackensen. His father, an administrator of agricultural enterprises, sent him to a &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; in Halle in 1865, seemingly in the hope that his eldest son would follow him in his profession.

Mackensen began his military service in 1869 as a volunteer with the Prussian 2nd Life Hussars Regiment (&quot;Leib-Husaren-Regiment Nr. 2&quot;). During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, he was promoted to second lieutenant and won the Iron Cross Second Class for leading a charge on a reconnaissance patrol north of Orléans. After the war, he left the service and studied at Halle University but returned to the German Army in 1873 with his old regiment.

He married Doris (Dorothea) von Horn, the sister of a slain comrade, in 1879. Her father, , was the influential &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; of East Prussia. They had two daughters and three sons. He found a mentor from the War Minister Julius von Verdy du Vernois. In 1891, Mackensen was appointed to the General Staff in Berlin and bypassed the usual three-year preparation in the War Academy. His chief, Helmuth von Moltke, found him a &quot;lovable character&quot;.

Mackensen was recalled from the regiment to serve as an adjutant to the next chief, Alfred von Schlieffen (in office 1891–1906), whom he regarded as a great instructor on how to lead armies of millions.
Mackensen impressed Kaiser Wilhelm II, who ordered that Mackensen be given command from 17 June 1893 of the 1st Life Hussars Regiment (&quot;Leib-Husaren-Regiment Nr. 1&quot;) to which he became &quot;à la suite&quot; when he left its command on 27 January 1898 and so he often wore the distinctive death&#x27;s head uniform thereafter. Mackensen was surprised by his next posting, as adjutant to Wilhelm II because he was the first commoner to hold that position. For the next three-and-a-half years, he shadowed the Kaiser and met the high and mighty of Germany, the rest of Europe and the Middle East. His sons were schooled with the Kaiser&#x27;s. Mackensen was ennobled on the Kaiser&#x27;s 40th birthday, 27 January 1899, and became &quot;August von Mackensen&quot;.

Next, he received the command of the newly created Life Hussar Brigade (&quot;Leib-Husaren-Brigade&quot;) from 1901 to 1903, and from 1903 to 1908, he commanded the 36th Division in Danzig.

His wife died in 1905, and two years later, he married Leonie von der Osten, who was 22 years old. When Schlieffen retired in 1906, Mackensen was considered as a possible successor, but the position went to Helmuth von Moltke the Younger. In 1908, Mackensen was given command of the XVII Army Corps, headquartered in Danzig. The Crown Prince was placed under his command, and the Kaiser asked Mackensen to keep an eye on the young man and to teach him to ride properly.

==First World War==
=== Eastern Front ===
At the outbreak of war in 1914, Mackensen, aged 65, commanded the XVII Army Corps, which became part of the German Eighth Army in East Prussia, under General Maximilian von Prittwitz, and then, 21 days later, under General Paul von Hindenburg. Mackensen had his corps moving out on a 25 km march to the Rominte River within fifty minutes of receiving his orders on the afternoon of 19 August 1914, after the Imperial Russian Army had invaded East Prussia. He led the XVII Corps in the battles of Gumbinnen (20 August 1914), Tannenberg (23 to 30 August 1914) and the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes (2 to 16 September 1914), which drove the invading Russians out of most of East Prussia.

On 2 November 1914, Mackensen took over command of the Ninth Army from Hindenburg, who became Supreme Commander East (&quot;Oberbefehlshaber Ost&quot;). On 27 November 1914, Mackensen was awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, Prussia&#x27;s highest military order, for successful battles around Warsaw and Łódź.

By April 1915, the Russians had conquered much of western Galicia and were pushing toward Hungary. In response to the desperate pleas from Vienna, German Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn agreed to an offensive against the Russian flank by an Austro-German army under a German commander. The reluctant Austro-Hungarian supreme command agreed that the tactful Mackensen was the best choice for commanding the coalition army. Army Group Mackensen (&quot;Heeresgruppe Mackensen&quot;) was established, containing a new German Eleventh Army, also under his command, and the Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army. As chief of staff, he was assigned Hans von Seeckt, who described Mackensen as an amiable, &quot;hands-on commander with the instincts of a hunter&quot;. His army group, which had an overwhelming advantage in artillery, smashed through the Russian lines between Gorlice and Tarnow and then continued eastward. Never giving the Russians time to establish an effective defence, it retook most of eastern Galicia, recapturing Przemyśl and Lemberg. The joint operation was a great victory for the Central Powers, which advanced 310 km (186 mi), and the Russians pulled out of all of Poland soon afterward.
Mackensen was awarded oak leaves to his &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; on 3 June 1915 and was promoted to field marshal on 22 June. He also received the Order of the Black Eagle, Prussia&#x27;s highest-ranking order of knighthood, as well as numerous honours from other German states – including the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph, the highest military honor of the Kingdom of Bavaria, on 4 June 1915 – and from Germany&#x27;s allies.

===Serbian campaign===
In October 1915, a new Army Group Mackensen (&quot;Heeresgruppe Mackensen&quot;, which included the German Eleventh Army, the Austro-Hungarian Third Army and the Bulgarian First Army), launched a renewed campaign against Serbia. The campaign crushed effective military resistance in Serbia but failed to destroy the Royal Serbian Army, half of which managed to retreat to Entente-held ports in Albania and, after recuperation and rearmament by the French and the Italians, re-entered fighting on the Macedonian front. When Mackensen returned to Vienna, he was honoured by a dinner and a personal audience with Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and was decorated with the magnificently jeweled Military Merit Cross 1st Class with Diamonds, a unique award for a foreigner.

Mackensen appears to have had great respect for the Serbian Army and Serbs generally. Before departing to the Serbian front in 1915, he had spoken to his men:

===Romanian campaign===
After Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary on 15 August 1916, Mackensen was given command of a multinational army, with General Emil von Hell as chief of staff, of Bulgarians, Ottomans, Austro-Hungarians and Germans. It assembled in northern Bulgaria and then advanced into Dobruja. By 8 September, it had taken the two major forts on the right bank of the Danube, the first in a single day by a force that was outnumbered by the besieged, who were overwhelmed by Mackensen&#x27;s artillery. Then, a German and Austro-Hungarian army group that was commanded by Falkenhayn broke into Wallachia through the Vulkan Pass in the Transylvanian Carpathian Mountains while Mackensen crossed the Danube by seizing bridgeheads on the left bank to shield the Austro-Hungarian engineers who built the long pontoon bridge. The Romanian Army and its Russian allies were forced back between those pincers. After three months of war, two thirds of Romania was occupied by the Central Powers. The capital of Romania, Bucharest, was captured by the Central Powers on 6 December 1916, on his 67th birthday. He rode in on a white horse and moved into the Romanian royal palace. 
For that performance, on 9 January 1917, Mackensen was awarded the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross and became one of only five recipients of that honour in the First World War. Since he now wore every Prussian medal, the Kaiser decided to name a battle cruiser after him, which became the first in a new class. Mackensen became the military governor of the large part of Romania (mainly Wallachia) that was occupied by the Central Powers. He proposed making a German prince the King of Romania, but the initiative fell through. His last campaign was an attempt to destroy the Romanian Army, which had been reorganised.

During the Battle of Mărăşeşti, both sides took heavy losses, but the Romanian Army emerged victorious. Mackensen maintained that he had never been defeated in battle, and he surely was the most consistently successful senior general on either side in World War I. By December 1917, the Russian Army had collapsed, and the Romanian Armed Forces were forced to sign the Armistice of Focșani, followed by the Treaty of Bucharest.

On 11 November 1918, Germany signed an armistice with the Allies under which it had to immediately withdraw all German troops in Romania, the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire back to German territory and Allies to have access to those countries.

==Postwar==
After the armistice, he and the 200,000 men he led back home were rounded up. He was arrested by the agents of the pro-Entente Hungarian leader Mihály Károlyi in Budapest. Mackensen was held in a guarded villa at the edge of Budapest. Later, he was handed over to the representatives of General Louis Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey&#x27;s Allied army. He was a military prisoner in Futog, Serbia, until November 1919. He was one of the 896 Germans on the Allied list of accused war criminals, which was eventually allowed to lapse.

By 1920, Mackensen had retired from the army. Although standing in opposition to the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles and the newly established parliamentary system of the Weimar Republic, he initially avoided public campaigns. Around 1924, he changed his mind and began to use his image as a war hero to support monarchist and nationalist groups. He routinely appeared in his old Life Hussars uniform. He became very active in pro-military Conservative Revolutionary movement organisations, particularly &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and the Schlieffen Society, which advocated the stab-in-the-back myth and openly endorsed the murder of Minister Matthias Erzberger in 1921.
During the German presidential election of 1932, Mackensen supported Paul von Hindenburg against Adolf Hitler, whose political skills he nevertheless admired.

After Hitler gained power in January 1933, Mackensen became a visible, if largely symbolic, supporter of the Nazi regime. A striking visual icon of the Prussian traditions adopted by Hitler&#x27;s regime, he appeared in his black uniform and death&#x27;s-head busby at public events organized by the German government or the Nazi Party such as the Day of Potsdam on 21 March 1933. On 26 August 1933, Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring appointed Mackensen to the recently reconstituted Prussian State Council. In 1935, he stood by Hitler&#x27;s side for the ceremonies of the March 16 &quot;Heldengedenktag&quot;, or Heroes&#x27; Memorial Day, celebrating Hitler&#x27;s public announcement that Germany would cease to comply with the Treaty of Versailles, and would openly re-arm. One of Mackensen&#x27;s ceremonial visits brought him to Passau, where he received a hero&#x27;s welcome.
Von Mackensen was, however, appalled by the murder of his friend General Kurt von Schleicher and General Ferdinand von Bredow in the Night of the Long Knives at the end of June 1934 and said so. He (with others) signed a letter to President von Hindenburg on 18 July detailing the brutal murder of von Schleicher and his wife, and noting that von Hindenburg&#x27;s friend Franz von Papen had barely escaped with his life. His letter demanded that von Hindenburg punish the responsible parties and create a directorate to rule Germany. He started a campaign to have von Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler and, when this gathered strength and succeeded, spoke about the murders at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935.

Von Mackensen did not, however, blame Hitler personally but rather some his more radical subordinates, probably wished Hitler to be retained as Chancellor under the suggested Directorate, and continued to stand by the regime. 

Occasionally mocked as the &quot;Reich Centrepiece&quot;, Mackensen&#x27;s ferocious soldier&#x27;s visage and distinctive public profile in his black Life Hussars uniform was even recognised by the Hausser-Elastolin company, which produced a 7 cm figure of him in its line of Elastolin composition soldiers. His fame and familiar uniform gave rise to two separate Third Reich units adopting black dress with &quot;Totenkopf&quot; badges: the &quot;Panzerwaffe&quot;, which claimed the tradition of the Imperial Cavalry, and the Schutzstaffel. In October 1935, the government vested Mackensen with the demesne of Brüssow in Brandenburg in recognition of his merits.
In spite of the implicit endorsement provided by his public appearances with high-ranking Nazi officials, Mackensen&#x27;s relationship to the Nazis was not fully approving: besides the killing of von Bredow and von Schleicher, he also objected to the Nazi &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot; measures against the Confessing Church and to the atrocities that were committed during the invasion of Poland in September 1939.

On 4 February 1940, Mackensen wrote to then Generaloberst Walther von Brauchitsch:

By the early 1940s, Hitler and Joseph Goebbels suspected Mackensen of disloyalty but refrained from taking action. Mackensen remained a committed monarchist and in June 1941 appeared in full imperial uniform at Kaiser Wilhelm funeral at Doorn, in the Netherlands.

Hitler personally congratulated Mackensen on his 95th birthday in December 1944 and awarded the 5th cavalry regiment with the armband &quot;Field marshal von Mackensen&quot;.

According to a radio news report dated 15 April 1945 that was filed by the CBS News correspondent Larry LeSueur for World News Today, Mackensen was briefly captured by the British Second Army at his home during the closing weeks of the Second World War. Upon the arrival of the British, not commenting on the general rout, the 95-year-old Mackensen merely asked the new powers-that-be that &quot;freed foreign workers&quot; be prevented &quot;from stealing his chickens&quot;.

Mackensen died on 8 November 1945 at the age of 95, his life having spanned the Kingdom of Prussia, the North German Confederation, the German Empire, the Weimar Republic, the Nazi regime and the postwar Allied occupation of Germany. He was buried in the Celle cemetery.

== Family ==
In November 1879, Mackensen married Dorothea von Horn (1854–1905), and they had five children:
* Else Mackensen (1881/2–1888)
* Hans Georg von Mackensen (1883–1947), diplomat
* Manfred von Mackensen (1886–1947)
* Eberhard von Mackensen (1889–1969), &quot;Generaloberst,&quot; German Army
* Ruth von Mackensen (1897–1945)

In 1908, after the death of his first wife, Mackensen married Leonie von der Osten (1878–1963).

Mackensen and his family were Lutheran Protestants in the Evangelical Church of Prussia.

The , named after Mackensen, was the last class of battlecruisers to be built by Germany in the First World War, the lead ship, SMS &quot;Mackensen&quot;, was launched on 21 April 1917.

Mackensen was an Honorary Citizen of many cities, such as Danzig, Heilsberg, Buetow, and Tarnovo. In 1915, the newly built rural village of Mackensen in Pomerania was named after him. In various cities, streets were named after him. In 1998 the &quot;Mackensenstraße&quot; in the Schöneberg district of Berlin was renamed &quot;Else-Lasker-Schüler-Straße&quot;, based on a claim that Mackensen was one of the &quot;pioneers of National Socialism&quot;.

<text>Bernard of Saxe-Weimar (; 16 August 160418 July 1639) was a German prince and general in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.
==Biography==
Born in Weimar in the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar, Bernard was the eleventh son of Johann, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Dorothea Maria of Anhalt.

Bernard received an unusually good education and studied briefly at the University of Jena, but soon went to the court of Duke John Casimir of Saxe-Coburg to engage in knightly exercises. At the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War he took the field on the Protestant side, and served under Mansfeld at Wiesloch (1622), under the Margrave of Baden at Wimpfen (1622), and with his brother William at Stadtlohn (1623). Undismayed by these defeats, he took part in the campaigns of King Christian IV of Denmark. After a severe defeat in Holstein in 1627, Bernhard left Danish service and went to the Dutch Republic. There he was present at the famous Siege of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in 1629.

When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden landed in Germany Bernard quickly joined him, and for a short time he was colonel of the Swedish life horse guard. After the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631), he accompanied Gustavus in his march to the Rhine and, between this event and the Battle of the Alte Veste, Bernard commanded numerous expeditions in almost every district from the Moselle to Tyrol. At the Alte Veste he displayed great courage, and at the Battle of Lützen (1632), when Gustavus was killed, Bernard assumed the command, killed a colonel who refused to lead his men to the charge, and finally by his furious energy won the victory at sundown.
At first as a subordinate to his brother William, who as a Swedish lieutenant-general succeeded to the command, but later as an independent commander, Bernard continued to push his forays over southern Germany; and with the Swedish General Gustav Horn he made in 1633 a successful invasion into Bavaria, which was defended by the imperialist general Count Aldringer. In this year he was granted the former Bishoprics of Würzburg and Bamberg, being granted the title of Duke of Franconia. He installed one of his many brothers as Statthalter, and returned to the wars. A stern Protestant, he exacted heavy contributions from the Catholic cities which he took, and his repeated victories caused him to be regarded by German Protestants as the saviour of their religion. But in 1634 Bernard suffered a great defeat at Nördlingen, losing the best of the Swedish army.

In 1635 Bernard entered the service of France, which had by then intervened in the war. He held a difficult dual position; in the following campaigns, ably and resolutely conducted as they were, Bernard sometimes pursued a purely French policy, whilst at other times he used French mercenaries to forward his own cause. From a military point of view his most notable achievements were on the common ground of the upper Rhine, in the Breisgau.

In his great campaign of 1638, Bernard won the battles of Rheinfelden, Wittenweiher, and Thann, and captured successively Rheinfelden, Freiburg, and Breisach, the last reputed one of the strongest fortresses in Europe. Bernard had in the first instance received definite assurances from France that he should be given Alsace and Haguenau, Würzburg having been lost in the debacle of 1634; he now hoped to make Breisach the capital of his new duchy.

Bernard&#x27;s health, however, was deteriorating. He died at Neuenburg am Rhein at the beginning of the campaign. The governor of Breisach Jean Louis d&#x27;Erlach was bribed to transfer the fortress to France. Bernard was temporarily buried at Breisach, his remains were not carried to Weimar until 16 years later.

<doc id="317686" wikidata="Q728145" url="?curid=317686" title="Departments of Honduras">
<text>Honduras is divided into 18 departments (Spanish: &quot;departamentos&quot;). Each department is headed by a governor, who is appointed by the President of Honduras. The governor represents the executive branch in the region in addition to acting as intermediary between municipalities and various national authorities; resolves issues arising between municipalities; oversees the penitentiaries and prisons in his department; and regularly works with the various Secretaries of State that form the President&#x27;s Cabinet. To be eligible for appointment as a governor, the individual must: a) live for five consecutive years in the department; b) be Honduran; c) be older than 18 years of age and; d) know how to read and write.

==Evolution of Honduras&#x27;s territorial organization==
* 1825: The constitutional congress convened in that year orders that the state be divided into seven departments: Comayagua, Denver, Santa Bárbara, Tegucigalpa, Choluteca, Yoro, Olancho, and Gracias (later renamed Lempira).
* 1834: An extraordinary constitutional assembly reduces the number of departments to four: this attempt fails to prosper, and the 1825 division remains in force.
* 1869: Congress orders the creation of the departments of La Paz (broken away from Comayagua), El Paraíso (from Tegucigalpa and Olancho), Copán (from Gracias), and La Mosquitia (from Yoro).
* 1872: A department called Victoria is ordered to be split from Choluteca, but this never comes into effect. Islas de la Bahía department is founded (the islands were ceded to Honduras by the United Kingdom in 1860).
* 1881: La Mosquitia joined with portions of Yoro to form Colón department.
* 1883: Intibucá department is formed from sections of La Paz and Gracias.
* 1893: Valle department (split from Choluteca) and Cortés department (split from Santa Bárbara) are created.
* 1902: Parts of Yoro and Colón are taken to form the new department of Atlántida.
* 1906: Ocotepeque department is created by dividing the territory of Copán.
* 1957: Colón is divided in two to create Gracias a Dios department.

<doc id="317688" wikidata="Q1139085" url="?curid=317688" title="Craven District">
<text>Craven was a non-metropolitan district in the west of North Yorkshire, centred on the market town of Skipton. The name &quot;Craven&quot; is much older than the modern district and encompassed a larger area. This history is also reflected in the way the term is still commonly used, such as by the Church of England.

In its modern manifestation, from 1974 until 2023, Craven was a separate local government district, formed originally as the merger of Skipton urban district, Settle Rural District and most of Skipton Rural District; all were historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Since 1 April 2023, it has formed part of the new North Yorkshire Council unitary authority. The population of the Local Authority area at the 2011 Census was 55,409; it comprised the upper reaches of Airedale, Wharfedale, Ribblesdale, and includes most of the Aire Gap and Craven Basin.

==History==

&quot;Craven&quot; has been the name of this district throughout recorded history. Its extent in the 11th century can be deduced from The Domesday Book but its boundaries now differ according to whether considering administration, taxation or religion.

=== Toponymy ===

The derivation of the name Craven is uncertain, yet a Celtic origin related to the word for garlic (&quot;craf&quot; in Welsh) has been suggested as has the proto-Celtic &quot;*krab-&quot; suggesting scratched or scraped in some sense and even an alleged pre-Celtic word &quot;cravona&quot;, supposed to mean a stony region.

In civic use the name Craven or Cravenshire had, by 1166, given way to Staincliffe. However, the church archdeaconry retained the name of Craven.

===Prehistory===

The first datable evidence of human life in Craven is ca 9000 BC: a hunter&#x27;s harpoon point carved out of an antler found in Victoria Cave. Most traces of the Mesolithic nomadic hunters are the flint barbs they set into shafts. Extensive finds of these microliths lie around Malham Tarn and Semerwater. Flint does not occur in the Dales, the nearest outcrop is in East Yorkshire. On higher ground microliths are found near springs at the tree line at indicating campsites close to the open hunting grounds. The valley woodlands were inhabited by deer, boar and aurochs, the higher ground was open grassland that fed herds of reindeer, elk and horse. No permanent settlements have been found of that age, hunting here was seasonal, returning to the plains in winter.

After 5000 BC long-distance trade is indicated by the distribution of stone axes. Lithic analysis can identify their quarry source as Langdale in central Cumbria and most finds are in Ribblesdale and Airedale indicating that Craven was their trade route through the Pennines.

Neolithic farmers permanently settled in Craven, bringing domesticated livestock and used those stone axes to clear woodlands, probably by slash-and-burn, to increase areas for grazing and crops.

===Roman occupation===

In the first century the Romans, having trouble controlling the Brigantes in the Yorkshire Dales, built forts at strategic points. In Craven one fort, possibly named Olenacum, is at Elslack . Through this fort passes a Roman road linking two other forts: Bremetennacum at Ribchester Lancashire and another at Ilkley Yorkshire. Archaeologists describe the road as running north-east up Ribblesdale about east of Clitheroe, then bending eastwards near , then about north of Barnoldswick to pass into Airedale through the low pass near Thornton-in-Craven.

===Anglo-Saxon===

 To collect the Danegeld in 991–1016 the Anglo-Saxons divided their territory into tax districts. The Wapentakes of Staincliffe and Ewcross covered the region we call Craven but also areas beyond it such as the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire; and Sedbergh in Cumbria to the North. The Church was still using these areas in the 16th century.

===Norman Conquest===

The farmlands were progressively taken from the Anglo-Scandinavian farmers and given by the King to selected Normans. The previous and subsequent landowners were recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; along with the area of the ploughland.

====The Domesday Book====

 The Great &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 did not use the later Wapentake district names in this part of England, as it usually did, but instead used the name Craven. The Book included lands further west than any later description: Melling, Wennington and Hornby on the River Lune in Lonsdale and even Holker near Grange over Sands in Cumbria.

The historic northwestern boundary of Craven is much disputed. One faction declares that before the Norman Conquest the North of England from coast to coast was administered from York and named The Kingdom of York. By 1086 the Normans had designated only one county in the North of England and that was Yorkshire. One may assume thereby that the Norman Yorkshire of 1086 was much the same as the Kingdom of York of 1065; and the Domesday Book supports this. However the opposing faction proposes that the first Yorkshire was smaller, much as it was up till 1974, and that Amounderness, Cartmel, Furness, Kendale, Copeland and Lonsdale were attached to it in the Domesday Book merely for administrative convenience.

Also the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; does not describe the width of Craven at all, for only arable land was noted. Ploughing is a minor part of Craven agriculture, and cultivators then had been reduced by the Harrying of the North. Most of Craven is uncultivable moorland and the valley bottoms are usually boggy, shady frost-hollows, with soils of glacial boulder clay very heavy to plough. So ploughing was limited to well-drained moderate slopes. The higher slopes are so full of rock debris that grazing cattle still is the primary living in Craven, with some sheep marginal. Because grazing land was not tallied in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; the full areas of the estates of the manors can only be induced

The areas of ploughland were counted in carucates and oxgangs: one carrucate being eight oxgangs and one oxgang varying from fifteen to twenty acres. This vagueness comes from an oxgang signifying the land one ox could plough and that varied with the heaviness of the local soil. A carucate was the area that could be managed with team of eight oxen.

In 1086 Roger of Poitou was Tenant-in-chief of the western side of Craven: Ribblesdale and the Pendle valley. In 1092 he was granted also Lonsdale to defend Morecambe Bay against Scottish raiding parties.

Soon after Henry I of England&#x27;s succession to the crown in 1100 arose a rebellion of men with a variety of grievances. Several Yorkshire lords were involved and suffered confiscation of their estates. In Craven these were Roger the Poitevin, Erneis of Burun and Gilbert Tison. The King conducted a reorganization of Yorkshire by establishing men more skilled in government. Shortly after 1102 the castleries in Cravenshire were divided between the House of Romille and the House of Percy. The King was clearly intent that Cravenshire should retain a compact structure for he added-in estates from his own demesne. The result was two partially interwoven castleries incorporating nearly all the land in Craven. The Percy estates were mainly concentrated in Ribblesdale with their castle at Gisburn while the Romilles dominated upper Wharfedale and upper Airedale with their fortress at Skipton Castle.

====14th century====

Craven was still suffering from Scottish raiders; for example in 1318 they severely damaged churches as far south as Kildwick.

In 1377, in the form of Poll Tax records, the earliest surviving detailed statistics of Craven were collected. From them we can compare the income brackets of various occupations, and the relative worth of villages.
The records list every hamlet and village using the wapentake system. The Wapentakes of Staincliffe and Ewcross cover Craven but also areas beyond such as Sedbergh to the North. Young King Richard II had commanded that poll tax to pay off the debts he had inherited from the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Its first application in 1377 was a flat rate and the second of 1379 was a sliding scale from 1 groat (4p pence) to 4 marks. However, the third tax of 1381 of 4 groats (1 shilling) and up was applied corruptly and led to the Great Rising of 1381.

====16th century====
The Deanery of Craven had similar boundaries to the Wapentake of Staincliffe and so included the following areas which are not in the modern secular district of Craven:
*A large part of what is now the City of Bradford, namely the parishes Keighley, Addingham, and the Silsden and Steeton with Eastburn parts of the parish of Kildwick. However all of Bingley and part of Ilkley, though never part of Staincliffe Wapentake, were within Craven and are also now within Bradford. (They were in the upper division of the Wapentake of Skyrack.)
*The northern section of the modern Lancashire District of Ribble Valley, including Gisburn in Craven, and the Bowland Forest parishes of Bolton by Bowland, Slaidburn and Great Mitton, the latter including Waddington, West Bradford, and Grindleton. (Sawley, while not technically in the old Deanery, is also in this geographical area.)
*The north-eastern section of the modern Lancashire district of Pendle, including Barnoldswick, Bracewell, and the part of the old parish of Thornton in Craven which includes Earby and Kelbrook

====17th century hearth tax====
These valuable records also define the area by wapentakes. This tax was introduced by the government of Charles II at a time of serious fiscal emergency, and collection continued until repealed by William and Mary in 1689. Under its terms each liable householder was to pay one shilling for each hearth within their property, due twice annually at the equinoxes, Michaelmas (29 September) and Lady Day (25 March). The Yorkshire records of all three ridings are now completely transcribed, analyzed and available free online

===History of agriculture===

====Sheep====
The hills and slopes of Craven are greatly involved in the history of sheep particularly in the history of wool.
After 5000 BC the Neolithic farming movement introduced domesticated sheep, but the Roman occupation of Britain introduced advanced sheep husbandry to Britain and made wool into a national industry. Craven was made accessible by major roads from Ribchester up Ribblesdale and from York through Ilkley. The extent of a Roman villa farm excavated at Gargrave implies it practiced grazing on nearby moorland.
By 1000 AD England and Spain were recognized as the pinnacles of European sheep wool production.
About 1200 AD scientific treatises on agricultural estate management began to circulate amongst the Cistercian monasteries in the Yorkshire dales. These indicated the way to greatest profit was to produce wool for export.
Fountains Abbey strongly affected Craven in upper Wharfedale, Airedale and Littondale. In 1200 the Abbey owned 15,000 sheep in various locations and traded directly with Italian merchants. On the limestone fells it held extensive sheep runs managed by granges located at valley heads to access both the moors and the rough pasture of valley sides. Many granges developed into hamlets. The Fountains&#x27; sheep administrative centre was at Outgang Hill, Kilnsey.
By 1320 Bolton Priory&#x27;s flock at Malham was about 2,750 and it built extensive sheep farm buildings there. Accounts show that a quarter of its cheese was sheep&#x27;s cheese, and that most of the Priory&#x27;s came from wool sales. It also developed fulling, sorting and grading into industries.
Feudal Lords began to imitate monastic management methods for their own estates and in 1350 when the Black Death killed off half the rent-paying farmers they had the bailiffs substitute sheep-pasture for tillage. The export of wool to the Flanders looms, and the concurrent growth of cloth manufacture in England, aided by Edward III&#x27;s importation of Flemish weavers to teach his people the higher skill of the craft, made demand for all the wool that English flocks could supply. As the profitability of wool further increased some landowners converted all arable land into sheep pasture by evicting whole villages. Over 370 deserted medieval villages have been unearthed in Yorkshire.
Henry VIII in 1539 suppressed the Monasteries and sold Littondale and the Bolton Priory&#x27;s estates in lower Wharefedale and Airedale to Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland and Lord of Skipton.
By 1600 the wool trade was the primary source of tax revenue for Queen Elizabeth I. Britain&#x27;s success made it a major influence in the development and spread of sheep husbandry worldwide.

In more modern times the Industrial Revolution brought factory production of wool cloth to towns further down Airedale and many Craven families, made redundant by agricultural machinery, moved south to work in the worsted mills.
However, in 1966 the price of wool fell by 40% due to the increased popularity of synthetic fibres. Farmers complain it now costs more to shear a sheep than you can get for its wool and the result is reduced flocks. Although the tough wool of hill sheep is still used for carpet weaving, sheep breeding is now mostly for lambs to sell on for fattening for meat in low pastures.

====Forestry====
The small surviving areas of ancient woodland in the area have high biodiversity value. However, the Pennines are now notably lacking in trees despite archaeological evidence showing 90% was woodlands before human settlement. Palynology indicates the decline in trees coincided with the increase in grasses in Neolithic times caused by direct clearance for pasture and by overgrazing.
Since sheep are grazers, not browsers, they do not affect mature trees, but they devour all their seedlings. With a much narrower face than cattle, they crop plants very close to the ground and with continuous grazing can overgraze land rapidly. Ancient Common Grazing rights made it impossible to grow trees, even for fuel, because coppicing requires enclosure to protect regrowth from sheep, and the rights deny enclosure.

From 2002 to 2008, a Yorkshire Dales National Park programme encouraged sheep farmers to switch uplands livestock from sheep to cattle since they do not graze so intensively. Traditional breeds such as Blue Greys and Belted Galloways can survive the harsh winters and live off the rough grasses just as well a sheep.
Until December 2013, The National Park Farming and Forestry Improvement Scheme is offering grants to help farming, forestry and horticultural businesses become more efficient, more profitable and resilient whilst reducing the impact of farming on the environment.

Since 1968, some moorland has been reforested by the Forestry Commission. Since 2005, the collection of indigenous seeds and propagation produced saplings for planting schemes that began in 2010. Between 2007 and 2013 The Dales Woodland Restoration Programme funded the creation of 450 hectares of new native woodland, almost all on privately owned land.

====Cattle====

In the 16th and 17th centuries Longhorn cattle prevailed in Craven. Good quality bulls were bought communally to improve the livestock on the common land beside each village. In the 18th century they crossbred with Shorthorns; fully grown crossbreeds weighed to .

Some graziers of the Craven highlands also visited Scotland, for example Oban, Lanark and Stirling, to purchase stock to be brought down the drove roads to the cattle-rearing district. In the summer of 1745 the celebrated Mr Birtwhistle had 20,000 head driven from the northernmost parts of Scotland to Great Close near Malham, a distance of ca .

In 1818 the Craven Heifer, bred for meat on the Bolton Abbey estate remains to this day the largest and fattest cow of her age ever shown in England, weighing .

In modern times dairy farming has predominated and after the 1970s Holstein Friesians became the most popular breed weighing ca 1600 pounds (725 kg).

====Crops====
Pollen analysis shows that the peak of arable agriculture in Craven was 320–410 AD, but outbreaks of pestilence in the 6th century and in the 7–8th century resulted in a shift away from ploughing to grazing. However, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records the Danish Viking settlers &quot;were engaged in ploughing and making a living for themselves.&quot;
Cultivation lynchet terraces and ridge-and-furrow fields of the Middle Ages are visible alongside many villages particularly in Wharfedale and Malhamdale and tithe records show they grew crops of oats, barley and wheat and in rotation, beans and peas.
However, the wool boom of the 16th century caused most arable land to be turned into pasture. In the 18th century miller&#x27;s records show they had to import wheat to grind and sell as flour but the farmers still grew oats for it formed the principle article of their subsistence, some made into bread and puddings but mostly cooked as oatcakes.
====Administration====
In the 18th century the national Board of Agriculture commissioned a survey of agriculture in the region, with a view of improving it. It was published in 1793 as &quot;General view of the Agriculture of the West Riding of Yorkshire&quot;, a 140-page book detailing every factor. The wide variety of soil composition resulted in tithes ranging from 6 shillings up to 3 pounds per acre and farms leasing from 50 to 500 pounds per year. It details by parish quantities of cattle and crop produced, their rotation and market value. The report recommended more wheat and turnips; more sheep and of better breed; criticized poor drainage and design of farm buildings and taught principles of farm management.

Average wages then paid to employees were 12 pounds per annum with victuals and drink; and to temporary labourers 2 shillings and sixpence per day with beer. Hours of work in winter were &quot;dawn till dark&quot; and in harvest time &quot;six till six, with one hour for dinner and another for drinking&quot;. The author shows concern for their virtue and welfare.

==Government==

===Parliamentary constituency===
Since 1983 Craven has been in the Parliamentary constituency of Skipton &amp; Ripon. This constituency is considered one of the safest seats in England with a long history of Conservative representation. The Member of Parliament (MP) was: John Watson 1983 to 1987; David Curry 1987 to 2010; Julian Smith since 2010.

=== Previous local authorities ===
In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, the non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire would be reorganised into a unitary authority. Craven District Council, the other district councils and North Yorkshire County Council were abolished on 1 April 2023 and their functions were transferred to a new single authority for the non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire.

===Former County Council===

North Yorkshire County Council administered an area of , the largest county in England. It was a non-metropolitan county that operated a cabinet-style council in Northallerton. The 72 councillors therein elected a council leader who appointed up to 9 councillors to form an executive cabinet.
NYCC Elections – 2017 results

====District divisions====

Craven, for representation on North Yorkshire County Council, was divided into seven divisions and each returned one councillor.
# Airedale 
# Mid-Craven 
# North Craven 
# Ribblesdale 
# Skipton East 
# Skipton West 
# South Craven

===Former District Council===

Elections to Craven District Council were held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 30 seats on the council being elected at each election. Since the first election to the council in 1973 the council had alternated between periods when no party had overall control and times when the Conservatives had a majority, apart from a 2-year period between 1996 and the 1998 election when the Liberal Democrats had a majority. After no party had a majority since 2001, the Conservatives regained overall control at the 2010 election and held it until abolition in 2023.

====District council wards====
There were 76 Civil Parishes in Craven.

They were grouped into 19 wards. The Wards were represented by 30 councillors; eight wards by one councillor and eleven by two councillors..

===Allied organisations===
Craven District Council allied with other organizations:
* &quot;North Yorkshire County&quot; was a two tier local authority area, with NYCC being the top and Craven District Council the bottom tier. Whilst CDC was responsible for providing some services NYCC was responsible for others.
* &quot;The Leeds City Region&quot; is the economic area comprising Craven, Harrogate, York, Bradford, Leeds, Selby, Calderdale, Kirklees, Wakefield and Barnsley. LCR members work together in fields such as transport, housing and spatial planning.
* &quot;North Yorkshire Strategic Partnership&quot; is a partnership of public sector, private sector and voluntary organizations in Craven working together to meet the needs of the communities.
* &quot;North Yorkshire Children&#x27;s Trust&quot;, part of the NYSP, represents all those agencies that working with children and young people across the county. NYCT promotes the five national Every Child Matters outcomes for children.
* &quot;York and North Yorkshire Cultural Partnership&quot; brings together a number of Yorkshire agencies that bring the benefits of culture to quality of life and economic regeneration. This partnership is working together to deliver the York and North Yorkshire Cultural Strategy 2009–2014.
* &quot;Welcome to Yorkshire&quot; works to improves what the region has to offer tourists.

==Other Cravens==

=== West Craven ===
In the 1974 government reorganization of the shire districts, some towns were lost to Lancashire, but because of cultural history some of them, all now part of the borough of Pendle, came to be known as West Craven: Barnoldswick, Earby, Sough, Kelbrook, Salterforth and Bracewell and Brogden. (Other more westerly parts of Craven that became parts of Ribble Valley in modern Lancashire, such as Gisburn, are not normally referred to as part of West Craven.)

=== Archdeaconery of Craven ===

The Anglican Church Archdeanery number 542 is named Craven and has four Deaneries: Ewecross, Bowland, Skipton and South Craven. Ecclesiastic Craven is much larger than the civic District of Craven; in particular northern Ewecross is in Cumbria county, lower South Craven is in West Yorkshire, and south-west Bowland is in Lancashire county. The Church of England has considered changing their boundary of Bowland to match that of civic Lancashire

=== Deanery of South Craven ===

The Deanery of South Craven is much bigger than the council election division of South Craven, as the Deanery of South Craven comprises the following parishes: Cononley, Cowling, Cross Roads cum Lees, Cullingworth, Denholme, East Morton, Harden, Haworth, Ingrow, Keighley (St Andrews), Kildwick, Newsholme, Oakworth, Oxenhope, Riddlesden, Silsden, Steeton with Eastburn, Sutton-in-Craven, Thwaites Brow, Utley and Wilsden. The Civic boundaries also contrast in that only Bradley, Cowling, Kildwick and Sutton-in-Craven are in North Yorkshire; the other 16 are in West Yorkshire.

====South Craven and Wharfedale====

South Craven is in the Archdeaconery of Bradford, and on 1 January 2017 The Church of England put into effect a redrawing of the map of its subdivisions of the Bradford Episcopal Area by geographic re-grouping This geographic departmentalization into four new deaneries is an effective mind map, whereby South Craven is now grouped by regional geography with similar parishes so they can work together more effectively.

Whereas South Craven was previously grouped with &quot;Ilkley and Keighley&quot; it is now adjoined to Wharfedale as South Craven and Wharfedale. The Deanery of South Craven and Wharfedale now includes: Addingham; St John Ben Rhydding; Burley Woodhead; St John the Evangelist, Cononley with Bradley; Cowling; Ilkley All Saints; St Margaret Ilkley; Kildwick; Christ Church Lothersdale; St John the Divine, Menston; St James Silsden; and St Thomas Sutton-in-Craven.

==Towns==
The largest town in Craven is Skipton. Other major population centres in the region include High Bentham, Settle, Grassington. The expanded villages of Sutton-in-Craven, Cross Hills and Glusburn are now considered one urban conglomerate.

==Geography==
Craven comprises the upper reaches of Airedale, Wharfedale, Ribblesdale and the river Wenning of Lonsdale.

===Topography===
Craven is a group of valleys. Through Craven the River Aire and River Wharfe flow east to the North Sea; and the River Ribble and River Wenning flow west to the Irish Sea.

To Craven&#x27;s north stand limestone mountains of up to above mean sea level and to its south lie bleak sandstone moors, that above grow little but bracken.

Transport can find the Pennines a formidable barrier for roads can be blocked by snow for several days. However, Craven makes a sheltered passageway with low passes.

===Natural vegetation===
At the end of the last ice age, ca 11,500 years ago, plants returned to the bare earth and archaeological palynology can identify their species. The first trees to colonize were willow, birch and juniper, followed later by alder and pine. By 6500 BC temperatures were warmer and woodlands covered 90% of the dales with mostly pine, elm, lime and oak. On the limestone soils the oak was slower to colonize and pine and birch predominated. Around 3000 BC a noticeable decline in tree pollen indicates that Neolithic farmers were clearing woodland to increase grazing for domestic livestock, and studies at Linton Mires and Eshton Tarn find an increase in grassland species in Craven.

On poorly drained impermeable areas of millstone grit, shale or clays the topsoil gets waterlogged in Winter and Spring. Here tree suppression combined with the heavier rainfall results in blanket bog up to thick. The erosion of peat ca 2010 still exposes stumps of ancient trees.
Vegetation in the Pennines is adapted to subarctic climates, but altitude and acidity are also factors. For example, on Sutton Moor the millstone grit&#x27;s topsoil below has a soil ph that is almost neutral, ph 6 to 7, and so grows good grazing. However, above it is acidic, ph 2 to 4, and so can grow only bracken, heather, sphagnum, and coarse grasses such as cottongrass, purple moor grass and heath rush. However dressing it with lime produces better quality grass for sheep grazing. Such is named upland grazing. This suggests that early pastoral farming on millstone grit soil flourished in areas where lime was most easily available.

==Demography==
* The population is increasing and growing older. By 2020 Craven&#x27;s population is projected at 63,400, an increase of 14.2% (2006 based sub-national population projections ONS)
* 95.6% of the Districts population is white British, with ethnic minority (BME) groups making up 4.4% (Mid Year 2006 Population Estimates, Experimental Statistics ONS).
* Young people aged 19 and under make up 22% of the population, those aged 20 to 64 make up 56%, and those aged 65 and over 22% (Mid Year 2008 Population Estimates, ONS)
* 17.23% of the population consider themselves to have a long-term limiting illness or disability (2001 Census Statistics ONS).

==Economy==

Economic forecasts for 2010 show that the Craven District&#x27;s diverse economy, measured in Gross Value Added (GVA), is worth £1.14 billion ($1.87 billion) Since 1998 the value of the District&#x27;s economy has grown by 45%. Craven hosts a variety of small businesses – 72% employ less than four people. Businesses that employ above 50 employees (2.2%) are mostly in the south of the District.
* The visitor economy sector has the largest number of businesses.
* The banking, finance and insurance sector has experienced significant growth since 2003 mainly through the Skipton Building Society group.
* Agriculture and land-based industries form a significant part of the District&#x27;s economy, particularly within the remoter areas.
* Manufacturing has declined since 2003 but is still a key sector: Major manufacturers are Systagenix Wound Management.

===Traditional mainstays===

====Agriculture====
The business of agriculture revolves around the market towns of Craven:
AHDB, the national Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, issues regional reports with constant updates on agricultural output:
* CATTLE: For example, at Skipton Auction Mart on one day 108 cattle were sold including 55 prime steers, 53 heifers, 2 young bulls and 21 older heifers (July 2011). In June 2013 the top price by weight was 185.5p/kg for two Aberdeen Angus-cross heifers at £1,075 ($1,681) per head. 
* SHEEP: For example, at Skipton Auction Mart in one day 985 lambs and 278 ewes/rams were sold (July 2011). In June 2013 the top price by weight for lambs was 240.8p/kg at £94 ($147) per head); rams fetched a top price of £79.50 ($124) per head and sheep averaged £47.10 ($73) per head.
* SHEEP DOGS auctions for working dogs are held seasonally at Skipton and Bentham. The world record price was broken in 2011 with £6,300 ($10,270) for &quot;Dewi Fan&quot; and again in May 2016, when &quot;Cap&quot; was sold at Skipton for £16,000.
* DAIRY: Traditionally Craven milk is mostly sold as cheese. North Yorkshire in 2008 had 649 holdings with 71,518 dairy cows aged over 2 years. Average annual milk yield is 7,406 litres/cow. Wholesale production of milk for all of North Yorkshire 2009/10 was 488,894,588 litres.
Two thirds of Craven lie within the Yorkshire Dales National Park where traditional landscape preservation is required.

====Quarrying====
Silurian gritstone is quarried along the North Craven Fault above Ingleton and in Ribblesdale. Lower Carboniferous Great Scar Limestone is quarried in those areas and also near Grassington. Carboniferous reef limestone is quarried around Skipton.

===Employment===

In 2008 there were 26,591 employed; 22% were self-employed. In 2010 each Full Time Equivalent (FTE) employee contributed £40,311 to the District&#x27;s economy, representing an increase in productivity of 21.9% since 1998; an annual increase of 1.8%. The value of output per capita (estimated to be £19,703) has increased by 32% since 1998.

== Transport ==
There are no motorways in the area. It was shown by a national detailed Land Use Survey by the Office for National Statistics in 2005, that Craven has the least proportion of land taken up by roads of any district in England: 0.7%. This compared with a maximum of over 20% in four London boroughs and the City of London.

===Passes===
Transport can find the Pennines a barrier on occasion when some roads are blocked by snow for several days. Craven is of great significance to the North of England for by its topography it provides low-altitude passes through &quot;the backbone of England&quot;. They were especially significant for the railway and canal builders. The lowest passes through the Pennines are:
* The Airedale to Ribblesdale pass near Barnoldswick is at Thornton-in-Craven 
* The Airedale to Ribblesdale pass near Settle is just East of Hellifield a point labelled Aire Gap on some maps.
* The Airedale to Pendle Water pass near Colne is at Foulridge also sometimes called Aire Gap.
* The Ribblesdale to Lonsdale pass near Settle is at Giggleswick Scar 

The nearest alternative pass through the Pennines is Stainmore Gap (Eden-Tees) to the North, but that is not in Craven&#x27;s league for it climbs to and its climate is classed as sub-arctic in places.

The nearest low-level routes across the country are over away: the Tyne Gap to the north, or the A619 road in Derbyshire to the south.

===Main routes===
* A59 road: York, Harrogate, Skipton, Barnoldswick, Clitheroe, Preston, Liverpool
* A65 road: Ilkley, Skipton, Settle, Ingleton, Kendal
* A629 road: Skipton, Keighley, Halifax, Huddersfield, Rotherham
* A56 road: Earby, Colne, M65 motorway, Burnley, Manchester, Chester
* Train: Skipton railway station to Leeds on the Airedale Line
* Train: Skipton railway station to Morecambe on the Leeds–Morecambe line
* Train: Settle railway station to Carlisle or Leeds on Settle–Carlisle line

====A59 York–Liverpool====
The A59 road runs along the southern edge of Airedale to Ribblesdale. It runs about north of a disused Roman road through Craven that took the lowest pass through Thornton-in-Craven.

==== A56 Skipton–Chester ====
The route now known as the A56—-M65 first developed as the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to carry heavy industrial goods like masonry stone, limestone, and coal. The planned route into Ribblesdale was via a lower level pass but the Industrial Revolution in Nelson and Colne made it seem more profitable to change their route to Foulridge near Colne despite it being the highest pass.

====A629 and A65 Keighley–Kendal====
The route of the A65 road is perhaps the oldest for it follows a Neolithic trade route for stone axes from central Cumbria. By the 18th century the principal exports were cattle and most imports came on ninety pack horses from Kendal. The cost of that for heavy goods was prohibitive so the textile industrialist of Settle campaigned that the road from Keighley to Kendal be made passable to wheeled vehicles and in 1753 the Keighley and Kendal Turnpike Trust was founded. By 1840 passenger stagecoaches ran daily but in 1878 Parliament abolished all Turnpikes and set up County Councils; and the management of the main roads was transferred to them.

By 1968 traffic had so increased in volume that it necessitated the rebuilding of the A629 and A65. The Skipton northern bypass of 1981 cost £16.4 million. The Kildwick bypass was completed in 1988.

==Education==

=== Educational attainment ===
The proportion of the working age population with high levels of educational attainment is above the national average, and 40% of the District&#x27;s residents have managerial and professional occupations.
Also Lantra&#x27;s Landskills offers workshops in efficiency and profitability in agriculture, horticulture and forestry with up to 70% funding. Craven is covered in &quot;Farm Business Support and Development&quot; and &quot;Yorkshire Rural Training Network&quot;.
Yet from 2004 to 2009 there was generally a decline in attainment of about 12% and the number of people in the District with no qualifications increased by 1.8%. Such people have reduced employment options, however Craven College in Skipton is one of the largest Further Education Colleges in North Yorkshire and provides an outreach service to rural areas.

=== Museums ===
Craven Museum &amp; Gallery in Skipton is one of three museums in the district. It has obtained funding to deliver various projects:
* The Phoenix Project; delivered in partnership with the three other museums in Craven increased accessibility of collections.
* The Archaeology in the Landscape project, targeting young people, families and the disadvantaged, delivers events, workshops, demonstrations and education programmes to 3,460 young people and over 17,000 adults.
*The Young Archaeologists Club programme delivered museum education to approx 3,000 students 2009–2010.

As part of the projects above Craven Museum &amp; Gallery staff worked with both the Museum of North Craven Life, The Folly in Settle and the Grassington Folk Museum.

=== Arts ===
Craven District supports arts through music, theatre, dance, literature, visual arts and festivals. Funding from the Arts Council England (Yorkshire) alone totalled £435,811 between 2006 and 2009. Grants from other sources including the Gulbenkian Fund and Esme Fairburn Trust totalling well over an additional £160,000. A new exhibition gallery was opened in 2005 at Craven Museum &amp; Gallery, Skipton, which now hosts a programme of exhibitions each year.

== Media ==
In terms of television, the district is covered by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire broadcast from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. However, north western parts of the district including Settle is served by BBC North West and ITV Granada which broadcast from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

BBC Local Radio for the district is served by BBC Radio York on 104.3 FM and BBC Radio Lancashire on 104.5 FM. County-wide commercial station are Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire (formerly Stray FM) on 107.8 FM and community based stations are Drystone Radio on 103.5 FM and Dales Radio (covering Settle and Ingleton) on 104.9 FM.

The district&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer&quot;.

==Sport==
Craven Council opened the &quot;Craven Pool and Fitness Centre&quot; in 2003 and extended it in 2007. The Centre reached the semi-finals in the Best Semi Best Sports Project category of The National Lottery Awards. The &quot;Craven Active Sports Network&quot; develops opportunities for participation in sport and active recreation, sourcing funding for a variety of projects throughout the District, totalling over £14.5 million in 2001–2011. The &quot;National Sport Unlimited Scheme&quot;, delivering a programme of sporting activity to 1,205 young people and teenagers, brought in £45,000 of external funding.

==Notable people==
In 1665 Lady Anne Clifford, 14th Baroness de Clifford, owned and restored Skipton Castle.

In 1548 William Craven of Appletreewick was born to a modest family in Appletreewick near Skipton. At age 14 he was sent to London to apprentice to a Watling Street tailor. He qualified in 1569 and made such a fine impression that in 1600 he was made Alderman of Bishopgate; in 1603 he was knighted by James I and in 1610 he was chosen Lord Mayor of London. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;Aptrick&#x27;s Dick Whittington&quot; suggesting that the story of Dick Whittington is based on his life. William made benefactions to Craven, founding the school in Burnsall.

One of William&#x27;s sons, John Craven, founded the famous Craven Scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge Universities and in 1647 left many large charitable bequests to Craven towns including Burnsall and Skipton.

In 1660 William&#x27;s first son William Craven was made the first Earl of Craven by Charles II. However, that title was eponymous for the estate was in Uffington, Berkshire so he was in no sense a lord of Craven Yorkshire.

The botanist George Caley (1770–1829) was born in Craven.

<doc id="317695" wikidata="Q381084" url="?curid=317695" title="Moulting">
<text>In biology, moulting (British English), or molting (American English), also known as sloughing, shedding, or in many invertebrates, ecdysis, is a process by which an animal casts off parts of its body to serve some beneficial purpose, either at specific times of the year, or at specific points in its life cycle.

In medieval times, it was also known as &quot;mewing&quot; (from the French verb &quot;muer&quot;, to moult), a term that lives on in the name of Britain&#x27;s Royal Mews where the King&#x27;s hawks used to be kept during moulting time before becoming horse stables after Tudor times.

Moulting can involve shedding the epidermis (skin), pelage (hair, feathers, fur, wool), or other external layer. In some groups, other body parts may be shed, for example, the entire exoskeleton in arthropods, including the wings in some insects.

==Examples==
==In birds==

In birds, moulting is the periodic replacement of feathers by shedding old feathers while producing new ones. Feathers are dead structures at maturity which are gradually abraded and need to be replaced. Adult birds moult at least once a year, although many moult twice and a few three times each year. It is generally a slow process: birds rarely shed all their feathers at any one time. The bird must retain sufficient feathers to regulate its body temperature and repel moisture. The number and area of feathers that are shed varies. In some moulting periods, a bird may renew only the feathers on the head and body, shedding the wing and tail feathers during a later moulting period. 

Some species of bird become flightless during an annual &quot;wing moult&quot; and must seek a protected habitat with a reliable food supply during that time. While the plumage may appear thin or uneven during the moult, the bird&#x27;s general shape is maintained despite the loss of apparently many feathers; bald spots are typically signs of unrelated illnesses, such as gross injuries, parasites, feather pecking (especially in commercial poultry), or (in pet birds) feather plucking. Some birds will drop feathers, especially tail feathers, in what is called a &quot;fright moult&quot;. 

The process of moulting in birds is as follows: First, the bird begins to shed some old feathers, then pin feathers grow in to replace the old feathers. As the pin feathers become full feathers, other feathers are shed. This is a cyclical process that occurs in many phases. It is usually symmetrical, with feather loss equal on each side of the body. Because feathers make up 4–12% of a bird&#x27;s body weight, it takes a large amount of energy to replace them.

For this reason, moults often occur immediately after the breeding season, but while food is still abundant. The plumage produced during this time is called postnuptial plumage. Prenuptial moulting occurs in red-collared widowbirds where the males replace their nonbreeding plumage with breeding plumage. It is thought that large birds can advance the moult of severely damaged feathers.

Determining the process birds go through during moult can be useful in understanding breeding, migration and foraging strategies. One non-invasive method of studying moult in birds is through using field photography. The evolutionary and ecological forces driving moult can also be investigated using intrinsic markers such as stable hydrogen isotope (δ2H) analysis. In some tropical birds, such as the common bulbul, breeding seasonality is weak at the population level, instead moult can show high seasonality with individuals probably under strong selection to match moult with peak environmental conditions.

A 2023 paleontological analysis concluded that moulting probably evolved late in the evolutionary lineage of birds.

===Forced moulting===
In some countries, flocks of commercial layer hens are force-moulted to reinvigorate egg-laying. This usually involves complete withdrawal of their food and sometimes water for 7–14 days or up to 28 days under experimental conditions, which presumably reflect standard farming practice in some countries. This causes a body weight loss of 25 to 35%, which stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also reinvigorates egg-production. 

Some flocks may be force-moulted several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were force-moulted in the US. Other methods of inducing a moult include low-density diets (e.g. grape pomace, cotton seed meal, alfalfa meal) or dietary manipulation to create an imbalance of a particular nutrient(s). The most important among these include manipulation of minerals including sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), iodine (I) and zinc (Zn), with full or partially reduced dietary intakes.

==In reptiles and amphibians==

Squamates periodically engage in moulting, as their skin is scaly. The most familiar example of moulting in such reptiles is when snakes &quot;shed their skin&quot;. This is usually achieved by the snake rubbing its head against a hard object, such as a rock (or between two rocks) or piece of wood, causing the already stretched skin to split. 

At this point, the snake continues to rub its skin on objects, causing the end nearest the head to peel back on itself, until the snake is able to crawl out of its skin, effectively turning the moulted skin inside-out. This is similar to how one might remove a sock from one&#x27;s foot by grabbing the open end and pulling it over itself. The snake&#x27;s skin is often left in one piece after the moulting process, including the discarded brille (ocular scale), so that the moult is vital for maintaining the animal&#x27;s quality of vision. The skins of lizards, in contrast, generally fall off in pieces.

Both frogs and salamanders moult regularly and consume the skin, with some species moulting in pieces and others in one piece.

==In arthropods==
In arthropods, such as insects, arachnids and crustaceans, moulting is the shedding of the exoskeleton, which is often called its shell, typically to let the organism grow. This process is called ecdysis. Most &quot;Arthropoda&quot; with soft, flexible skins also undergo ecdysis. Ecdysis permits metamorphosis, the sometimes radical difference between the morphology of successive instars.

A new skin can replace structures, such as by providing new external lenses for eyes. The new exoskeleton is initially soft but hardens after the moulting of the old exoskeleton. The old exoskeleton is called an exuviae. While moulting, insects cannot breathe. In the crustacean &quot;Ovalipes catharus&quot; molting must occur before they mate. 
==In dogs==

Most dogs moult twice each year, in the spring and autumn, depending on the breed, environment and temperature. Dogs shedding much more than usual are known as &quot;blow coats&quot; or &quot;blowing coats&quot;.

==In Guinea Pigs, Hamsters &amp; Rabbits==
Most guinea pigs moult constantly, whereas hamsters shed less frequently, and rabbits experience seasonal moulting in spring and autumn. The moulting process in small mammals is influenced by seasonality, hormones, and overall health. In hamsters, excessive shedding may indicate stress or disease. A balanced diet and regular grooming are essential for maintaining a healthy coat.

<text>Peter Ernst, Graf von Mansfeld (; 158029 November 1626), or simply Ernst von Mansfeld, was a German military commander; despite being a Catholic, he fought for the Protestants during the early years of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He was one of the leading mercenary generals of the early war.

==Biography==
Ernst was an illegitimate son of Count Peter Ernst von Mansfeld (1517–1604) by Anna von Benzerath. His father was a member of the House of Mansfeld and royal Spanish stadtholder, while his mother belonged to a significantly lower nobility. All three children born into this liaison were legitimated when his parents subsequently married on 28 February 1591 in Brussels. He was raised in the Catholic faith at his father&#x27;s palace in Luxembourg.

He gained his earliest military experiences during the Long War in Hungary, where his elder half-brother Charles (1543–1595), also a soldier of renown, held a high command in the imperial army. While his brother succumbed to an epidemic within short time, young Ernst stayed at the theatre of war for several years. In the War of the Jülich Succession he served under Archduke Leopold V of Austria, until that prince&#x27;s ingratitude, real or fancied, drove him into the arms of the enemies of the House of Habsburg. Although he remained a Roman Catholic, from about 1610 he openly allied himself with the Protestant princes, and during the earlier part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War he was one of their foremost champions. In 1615-1617 he took part in the Uskok War.

He was despatched by Charles Emmanuel, Duke of Savoy, at the head of about 2000 men to aid the revolting Bohemians when war broke out in 1618. He took Pilsen, but in the summer of 1619 he was defeated at the Battle of Sablat; after this he offered his services to the Emperor Ferdinand II and remained inactive while the titular king of Bohemia, Frederick V, Elector Palatine of the Rhine, was driven in headlong rout from Prague. Mansfeld, however, was soon appointed by Frederick to command his army in Bohemia, and in 1621 he took up his position in the Upper Palatinate, successfully resisting the efforts made by Tilly to dislodge him.

From the Upper Palatinate, he passed into the Rhenish Palatinate. Here he relieved Frankenthal and took Hagenau; then, joined by his commander, the elector Frederick, he defeated Tilly at Wiesloch (25 April 1622) and plundered Alsace and Hesse. However, Mansfeld&#x27;s ravages were not confined to the lands of his enemies; they were ruinous to the districts he was commissioned to defend. At length, Frederick dismissed Mansfeld&#x27;s troops from his service. With Christian of Brunswick the count then entered the service of the United Provinces and marched to the Republic through the Spanish Netherlands. In August 1622, at Fleurus his army had to fight its way through a Spanish attempt to block him. His army recuperated and reequipped in September and then marched with the Dutch army to relieve the city of Bergen op Zoom, besieged by Spain. After that, he took up his quarters in East Frisia, capturing fortresses and inflicting great hardships upon the inhabitants. A mercenary and a leader of mercenaries, Mansfeld often interrupted his campaigns by journeys made for the purpose of raising money, or in other words of selling his services to the highest bidder, and in these diplomatic matters he showed considerable skill.

About 1624 he paid three visits to London, where he was hailed as a hero by the populace, and at least one to Paris. James I, being the father-in-law of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, was anxious to furnish him with men and money for the recovery of the Palatinate, but it was not until January 1625 that Mansfeld and his army of &quot;raw and poor rascals&quot; sailed from Dover to the Netherlands before failing to relieve the siege of Breda. Later in the year, the Thirty Years&#x27; War having been renewed under the leadership of Christian IV of Denmark, he re-entered Germany to take part therein but on 25 April 1626 Wallenstein inflicted a severe defeat upon him at the bridge of Dessau. Mansfeld, however, quickly raised another army, with which he intended to attack the hereditary lands of the house of Austria, and pursued by Wallenstein he pressed forward towards Hungary, where he hoped to accomplish his purpose by the aid of Bethlen Gábor, prince of Transylvania but when Bethlen changed his policy and made peace with the emperor, Mansfeld was compelled to disband his troops. Already weakened by ill health, he set out for Venice, but when he reached Rakovica near Sarajevo, in Bosnia, he took a turn for the worse and died on 29 November 1626, of natural causes. According to one account, Mansfeld, knowing his end was near, donned his armour and propped by two of his soldiers he gave a farewell speech to his remaining followers and died at sunrise while standing up. He was buried in Split.

<doc id="317700" wikidata="Q2777879" url="?curid=317700" title="Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room">
<text>Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room is an attraction located in Disneyland at the Disneyland Resort and in Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, and previously in Tokyo Disneyland at Tokyo Disney Resort. First opened on June 23, 1963 at the Disneyland Resort, the attraction is a pseudo-Polynesian musical Audio-Animatronic show drawing from American tiki culture.

The Floridian version of this attraction, which was identical but with a different pre-show, was known as Tropical Serenade until 1998, when it was replaced with an updated version of the attraction called The Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management), featuring &quot;Aladdin&quot;″s Iago and &quot;The Lion King&quot;″s Zazu. That version operated until 2011, when it was damaged by a fire, which led to Disney reintroducing an edited version of the original Walt Disney attraction to replace it. The Japanese version of this attraction operated until 1999, when it was first redeveloped into a nightclub-style version of the show called The Enchanted Tiki Room Presents: Get the Fever!, before it was redeveloped again as The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!, a partially &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;-themed version of the attraction.

==History==
The attraction opened June 23, 1963, and was the first to feature Audio-Animatronics technology, a WED Enterprises patented invention. The attraction was sponsored by United Airlines for its first 12 years; in 1976, sponsorship passed over to Hawaii&#x27;s Dole Food Company, which remains the sponsor to the present day. Dole also provides the unique Dole Whip soft-serve frozen dessert sold at a snack bar near the entrance.

The show was originally going to be a restaurant featuring Audio-Animatronics birds serenading guests as they dined. The &quot;magic fountain&quot; at the room&#x27;s center was originally planned as a coffee station (there is still a storage compartment in its base). The restaurant would have shared its kitchen with the now-defunct Tahitian Terrace in Adventureland and the Plaza Pavilion restaurant at the corner of Main Street, U.S.A., since all three are actually part of the same building. Because ownership of the attraction was separate from the rest of the park, a nominal admission charge of $0.75 was levied. Because computers generate significant heat (particularly in their earliest forms) and played a central role in the attraction, the Tiki Room was also Disneyland&#x27;s first fully air-conditioned building.

It houses a Hawaiian-themed musical show &quot;hosted&quot; by four lifelike macaws whose plumage matches the flags of their implied countries of origin. &quot;José&quot; is red, white, and green and speaks with a Mexican accent voiced by Wally Boag. &quot;Michael&quot; is white and green with an Irish brogue voiced by Fulton Burley. &quot;Pierre&quot; is blue, white, and red and has a French accent voiced by Ernie Newton. Red, black and white &quot;Fritz&quot; has a German accent provided by Thurl Ravenscroft. Controversy over the use of nationalism-associated white rather than gold/yellow has led counter-antisemitic groups to press for a change in Fritz&#x27;s color, a change of the character to a representative of another nation, or a wholesale abandonment of the national-representative theme of flag-based color schemes and stereotyped accents.

The main birds have changed colors over the years. In 1965, the four host birds had almost identical plumage of white, green, yellow and blue. The four macaws and the other birds are plumed with real feathers, with the exception of chest plumage. The chests are covered in custom-woven cashmere which allows the figures to &quot;breathe&quot; in a lifelike manner. The choice came quite by accident; in a planning meeting, Harriet Burns noticed a cashmere sweater that Walt Disney was wearing which moved at the elbows exactly the way the engineers envisioned.

==Description==

The presentation features a &quot;cast&quot; of over 150 talking, singing and dancing birds, flowers, the aforementioned magic fountain, tiki drummers and tiki totem poles that perform the attraction&#x27;s signature tunes, &quot;The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room&quot; by the Sherman Brothers and &quot;Let&#x27;s All Sing Like the Birdies Sing&quot;. The finale has every Audio-Animatronics figure performing a rousing version of &quot;Hawaiian War Chant&quot;. The exit music diverges from the quasi-tropical theme: namely, an arrangement of &quot;Heigh-Ho&quot; from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; with lyrics thanking guests for watching the show and hurrying them to the exit.

So innovative was the technology by 1963 standards that an Audio-Animatronics talking &quot;barker&quot; bird (Juan, cousin of José) once located near the walkway to beckon visitors inside, drew enormous crowds of visitors trying to catch a glimpse of it. While waiting outside in a lanai area for the show to start, visitors are serenaded by Hawaiian music which at one time included that of Martin Denny and Bud Tutmarc.

Polynesian gods are represented as well around the perimeter of the lanai, each with a rhyming legend to tell via Audio-Animatronics. Some of the gods depicted are Hina Kuluua, goddess of rain; Rongo, god of agriculture; Maui, who roped the playful sun; and Tangaroa, father of all gods and goddesses. A brief documentary of the history of the pineapple is presented as well. The story, filmed in the early 1960s and updated at the end with a Macromedia Flash presentation of a parade of Dole products, is shown on a screen on the rear of the roof of the Dole snack bar at the entrance to the lanai. In the main show, one chorus of &quot;Let&#x27;s All Sing Like the Birdies Sing&quot; has José crooning like Bing Crosby, Fritz scat-singing in a gravelly voice like that of Louis Armstrong, and Pierre singing like Maurice Chevalier. After this, the birds cue a sing-along from the audience, and then a whistle-along, set to a wild can-can setting of the tune.

By the mid-1990s, the Enchanted Tiki Room audio system was dramatically enhanced. Subwoofers were placed in the back rows. Modern mid-range speakers and high-range tweeters were placed throughout the room. For the first time, every instrument played in the 1963 recording could be heard clearly. Soon after, the attraction received another alteration: Nearly four minutes of the original 17-minute show were removed: a verse of &quot;The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room&quot;, a whistling verse of &quot;Let&#x27;s All Sing Like The Birdies Sing&quot;, and the &quot;Barcarolle&quot; number from Offenbach&#x27;s opera &quot;Tales of Hoffmann.&quot; Additional minor cuts and trims were made to voice parts to make the edits seamless.

Another renovation came to the show in the following decade: The Enchanted Tiki Room reopened in March 2005 after a seven-month refurbishment, commissioned by new Disneyland management as part of its effort to restore the park for its 50th birthday. Prior to this renovation, feathers regularly fell from the Audio-Animatronics birds, the building&#x27;s thatched roof was breaking away in broad daylight, and the Audio-Animatronic figures&#x27; movements were noisy and slow. Afterward, the original show and storyline remained, but were now enhanced with a digitally remastered audio track, a new sound system indoors and out, and completely new Audio-Animatronics figures that looked the same as the previous ones, but had a completely different internal apparatus. Updates in technology allowed Walt Disney Imagineering, the descendants of WED Enterprises, to create a show to satisfy 21st century expectations while retaining its classic look.
A few changes were made to the show itself after its refurbishment: In the pre-show in the lanai, rhythmic drums are heard near each god indicating who was going to tell their story next, and the order of the gods was changed. In the main show, the untitled instrumental interlude was cut and the four MC birds&#x27; dialogue was abridged.

The original Tiki Room was controlled by a large roomful of floor-to-ceiling computers that operated the birds with data on magnetic tapes, located beneath the floor of the show room. Footage of the original control room is available on the 1965 10th anniversary special featuring Walt Disney and &quot;Miss Disneyland 1965&quot;, &quot;The Tencennial Special&quot;.

== Walt Disney World ==

A virtually identical copy of the show, called Tropical Serenade, was installed at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom when that park opened in 1971. Although accompanied by a new pre-show, the main show was the same. Tropical Serenade was eventually renamed The Enchanted Tiki Birds in 1993 and replaced in 1998 with The Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management), featuring Iago from &quot;Aladdin&quot; and Zazu from &quot;The Lion King&quot;. The attraction was met with mixed reception from guests.

On January 12, 2011, a small fire broke out in the attraction&#x27;s attic, severely damaging the Iago audio-animatronic figure. It was announced at Disney&#x27;s D23 Destination D: Walt Disney World 40th Anniversary Conference that the attraction had been refurbished and returned to the original show format.

The attraction reopened on August 15, 2011 as Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room, a slightly edited version of Disneyland&#x27;s original show.

== Tokyo Disneyland ==
The attraction was once a clone of the original attraction until it closed for refurbishments in June 16, 1999, when it became &quot;The Enchanted Tiki Room: Now Playing &quot;Get the Fever!&quot;&quot;, where the attraction was re-themed as a madcap Las Vegas-style nightclub show in the middle of the jungle. In January 27, 2008, it closed again and reopened on July 25, 2008, as The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents Aloha e Komo Mai!, featuring Stitch from &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. This version is the only Enchanted Tiki Room without the attraction&#x27;s classic theme song.

== Original show soundtrack ==
On the original sound recording of the Enchanted Tiki Room for Disneyland, most of the background birds were created by Purv Pullen (aka Dr. Horatio Q. Birdbath). Pullen was a comedy talent best known for his time with Spike Jones and his City Slickers.

A D23 article published for the 50th Anniversary of the attraction in 2013 also cites contributions to the voices of the background birds from Clarence Nash, Maurice Marcelino, and Marion Darlington. Nash voiced Pierre&#x27;s impression of Donald Duck in the Tokyo version of the attraction, which replaced the character&#x27;s impression of Maurice Chavalier in the American iterations. The chanting of the tikis in the &quot;Hawaiian War Chant&quot; and the voices of Maui, Ngendi, Koro and Rongo in the waiting area were provided by Hawaiian musician Ernest Tavares. Ginny Tyler voiced Pele and Tangaroa-Ru and Anne Essex voiced Hina.

Wally Boag is also credited as providing the voice for José the parrot. Longtime Disney collaborator Thurl Ravenscroft gave a 1996 &quot;Disneyland Inside Out&quot; interview to J. D. Roth, in which he pointed out all of the various voices he performed across Disneyland, including Fritz the bass-voiced German parrot.

== In popular culture ==
* A version of the Enchanted Tiki Room appears in season 1, episode 12 of &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;, titled &quot;The Enchanting Hut.&quot; When Mickey and Minnie are threatened by a tropical storm while vacationing on an island, the sentient flora and fauna assemble a tiki hut to shelter them. By the end of the episode, the interior of the hut closely resembles the park attraction, complete with singing tiki poles, flowers, macaws, and the central fountain.
* The missing &quot;Rosita&quot;, who became the centerpiece of the adjacent Tropical Hideaway eatery at Disneyland, is featured in the &quot;Jungle Cruise&quot; film as Nilo Nemolato&#x27;s pet.
* The &quot;Tales from Adventureland&quot; books by Jason Lethcoe would feature the Tiki Room as a key location in the first volume &quot;The Keymaster&#x27;s Quest&quot;, depicting it as a hidden sanctuary for talking birds known as the Akamai located on the Hawaiian island of Molokai.
* Marvel Comics&#x27;s Disney Kingdoms imprint published a five-part miniseries based on the Enchanted Tiki Room in 2016. It took the form of an ensemble comedy loosely inspired by the television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; with visitors to the island working through their personal issues in a fantastical way, while the friendship between the four macaws starts to strain from José&#x27;s ego begins growing out of control.

<doc id="317703" wikidata="Q3227198" url="?curid=317703" title="Baby the Rain Must Fall">
<text>Baby the Rain Must Fall is a 1965 American drama film directed by Robert Mulligan and starring Lee Remick, Steve McQueen and Don Murray. Dramatist Horton Foote, who wrote the screenplay, based it on his 1954 play &quot;The Traveling Lady.&quot; This is Glen Campbell&#x27;s film debut, in an uncredited role.

==Plot==
Georgette Thomas and her six-year-old daughter, Margaret Rose, travel from the East Texas town of Tyler to (unknown to him) meet her husband Henry Thomas in his small southeastern Texas hometown of Columbus. Henry is a somewhat irresponsible rockabilly singer-guitarist who has recently been released from prison after serving time for stabbing a man during a drunken brawl, and wasn&#x27;t thinking of Georgette at all.

After his reunion with his wife, and his introduction to his daughter, Henry tries to make a home for his family. But Kate Dawson, the aging spinster who raised him after his parents died, remains a formidable presence in his life and tries to sabotage his efforts. She threatens repeatedly to have him returned to prison if he fails to acquiesce to her demands to give up singing, go to night school, and get a real job. He resists this and convinces Georgette he will be a star someday, as he continues playing and working a part-time job with the Tillmans.

When Kate Dawson dies, Henry drunkenly destroys her possessions the evening after the funeral – several shots show the belt she beat him with, untouched, hanging on a door near her bedroom – leaves with the silver willed to Mrs. Tillman, then wrecks his car on the cemetery gate and repeatedly stabs her grave with a knife in hysteria while, unbeknownst to him, his wife is nearby watching in horror.

Henry is destined for prison again, so Georgette and Margaret Rose leave Columbus in a car driven by Henry&#x27;s childhood friend, the local sheriff&#x27;s deputy, Slim. Slim had tried to help straighten Henry out since before the arrival of Georgette and Margaret Rose to Columbus, but failed. Georgette had done her best to love and gently comfort her self-tortured and cold husband Henry, but was also unsuccessful.

In the final scene, after an indeterminate time has passed and they have loaded their vehicle and driven away from the rented house, Georgette sees Henry (as does Slim) in the barred back of a sheriff&#x27;s vehicle at a road crossing stop. She turns Margaret Rose away before she sees him, bound on his way back to &quot;the pen&quot;.

As they drive out of town and enter the open highway, Georgette answers Margaret Rose&#x27;s question of where they are going; that they are driving away to the warm Valley, to begin a new life together. Georgette tells Margaret Rose that they have traveled a long way, from Lovelady to Tyler, from Tyler to Columbus, and now to the distant Valley (Lovelady is Georgette&#x27;s hometown, and where she and Henry met and married), and notes to the child that nobody could say they don&#x27;t get around.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot on location in the Texas cities of Columbus, Bay City, Wharton and Lockhart, and a scene in which Lee Remick works at a hamburger joint was filmed at the Baskin-Robbins ice cream store in Tarzana, California.

Many of the scenes were filmed in Columbus (the movie&#x27;s actual locale), including those of the Colorado County Courthouse, the downtown store and bus shots (to the west of the Courthouse, on Milam St.), the Tillman&#x27;s house (a block away from the Courthouse), and those of the Columbus Cemetery. A significant evening scene, in which late-working Deputy Slim and Judge Ewing walk away from the Courthouse toward the street, shows a notable Columbus building (now a museum) across Spring Street: the historic 1886 Stafford-Miller House. Some of the downtown scenes show another notable Columbus building in the background, the 1886 Stafford Opera House (next to the Stafford-Miller House; both south of the Courthouse), especially the morning scenes in front of the real estate office.

The last part of the &quot;goodbye&quot; scene, in which Henry leaves behind deputy Slim, the sheriff, Georgette and Margaret Rose, and takes off running, trips, then grabs onto the back of a flatbed truck, falls to the road and is captured by Slim, was filmed in Wharton at the southern end of Texas Farm to Market Road 102, (FM-102). The isolated country rental house scenes in which Henry, Georgette and Margaret Rose live together were filmed near Bay City, just inland of the Gulf coast, south of Wharton and Columbus.

The title song, with music composed by Elmer Bernstein and lyrics written by Ernie Sheldon, was performed by McQueen&#x27;s character in the film. A version by Glenn Yarbrough reached #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #2 on the Easy Listening chart. An instrumental version of the title song is used on some versions of film.

In one scene in which McQueen sings at a bar with his rockabilly band, one of his bandmates (to Henry&#x27;s right) is singer-songwriter Glen Campbell, who is extremely visible standing behind McQueen in a close two-shot but is uncredited in the film. The band drummer, also uncredited, is fellow session musician Hal Blaine, both members at that time of the famed Los Angeles-based &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; wrote, &quot;As honest and humble as is the effort to make the viewer sense a woman&#x27;s baffled love for a shifty and mixed-up fellow in &quot;Baby, the Rain Must Fall,&quot; there is a major and totally neglected weakness in this film from a Horton Foote play that troubles one&#x27;s mind throughout the picture and leaves one sadly let-down at the end. It is the failure of the screenwriter--Mr. Foote himself--to clarify why the object of the woman&#x27;s deep affection is as badly mixed-up as he is and why the woman, who seems a sensible person, doesn&#x27;t make a single move to straighten him out...Granting that the wife is astonished and distressingly mystified at the neurotic behavior of her husband, this doesn&#x27;t mean that the viewer is satisfied to be kept in the dark as to the reasons for the stark and macabre goings-on...As it is, we only see that these two people are frustrated and heart-broken by something that&#x27;s bigger than the both of them. But we don&#x27;t know what it is.&quot;

The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s chief assets were &quot;outstanding performances by its stars and an emotional punch that lingers...Other cast members are adequate, but roles suffer from editorial cuts (confirmed by director) that leave sub-plots dangling.&quot;

<doc id="317704" wikidata="Q10856113" url="?curid=317704" title="Natural Bridge Caverns">
<text>The Natural Bridge Caverns are the largest commercial caverns in the US state of Texas. The name is derived from the natural limestone slab bridge that spans the amphitheater setting of the cavern&#x27;s entrance. The span was left suspended when a sinkhole collapsed below it.

The caverns are located near the city of San Antonio, Texas, in the Texas Hill Country next to the Natural Bridge Wildlife Ranch, a drive-through wildlife safari park. The caverns feature several unique speleothems and other geological formations. The temperature inside the cave is year-round and the humidity rate is a constant 99 percent. The deepest part of the public tour is below the surface, although undeveloped areas of the cavern reach depths of .

The caverns are still slowly developing. Due to the porosity of the limestone, rainwater travels downward through the layers of rock, where it dissolves out calcite, a weak mineral that makes up all the speleothems at the Natural Bridge Caverns. After exiting the limestone, water enters the caverns where it flows and drips constantly throughout, causing the formations to retain a waxy luster that can be seen in a few caverns.

==History==
The caverns were discovered on March 27, 1960, by students Orion Knox Jr., Preston Knodell Jr., Al Brandt, and Joe Cantu from St. Mary&#x27;s University in nearby San Antonio. On their fourth trip into the caverns, the men discovered/explored just over of passage. Subsequent explorations revealed associated with what became known as the &quot;North Cavern&quot;.

After discovery, Knox assisted the landowners in obtaining information and suggestions for development. Clara Wuest (the landowner) wanted to show the world the cave under her property. Knox approached both the National Park Service and the Texas Park System. While both entities agreed that the cavern was substantial and merited development, both groups told the landowners that funds did not exist for their respective groups to undergo such an endeavor.

Wuest then decided that she would fund development. Knox dropped out of school to assist. He also approached Jack Burch, who had just finished work on developing the Caverns of Sonora near Sonora, Texas. Burch agreed to help and development began early in 1963. Wuest remarried Harry Heidemann, a retired Texas Highway Patrolman, in the early 1960s. Together, they started work on developing the cavern. The full-time development crew included Wuest (now Wuest-Heidemann), Heidemann, Burch, Knox, and Reggie Wuest (Wuest-Heidemann&#x27;s son). Development on the cavern began in 1963 and work on lights and trails continued until opening day, July 3, 1964. The cavern has been opened ever since and is still owned and operated by family members. The Natural Bridge Caverns became a registered US National Natural Landmark in 1971.

During excavation of the entrance trail, a human tooth, arrowheads, and spearheads dating from 5000 BCE were found. Also, just inside the entrance, a jawbone and femur from an extinct species of black bear were discovered. This leads many to believe that the uppermost areas of the cavern were used as a shelter by early peoples and animals at some point. An archeological dig was recently done under the natural bridge. Archeologists recovered arrowheads and other tools which further indicate the presence of early peoples at some point in history.

==Further exploration==
In 1967, speculation on a southern extent to the North Cavern was confirmed when test drilling indicated the presence of a large void approximately beneath the surface. A camera was sent down the narrow shaft and photographs revealed a large chamber filled with formations. This original shaft was reamed out to and three men were lowered into the ground. They discovered a large breakdown chamber and numerous formations. The first three men to enter this room were Jack Burch, Reggie Wuest, and Myles Kuykendall. By combining the first two letters of each man&#x27;s first name, they arrived at JAREMY, and thus this newly discovered room was called the Jaremy Room.

Further investigation near the bottom of the Jaremy Room revealed a strong likelihood that another passage existed beyond a pile of rocks and boulders. In 1968, the drillers were once again brought out to the property and another exploratory shaft was sunk into the ground. This shaft also penetrated a large void approximately below ground. As before, the initial shaft was enlarged and people dropped down into the unknown. Explorations revealed another half-mile () of cavern extending to the south. This then became known as the South Cavern.

==Recent exploration==
Exploration continues to date. During mid-2005, several hundred feet were added to the current surveyed length of the cave. It is believed that as much as another mile () could be added to the survey by just mapping the known passages which have not yet been surveyed. Additional unexplored leads exist in sections of the Discovery Passages (North Cavern).

Since May 8, 2019, a team of cave explorers have discovered over of new never before seen passages. As explorers move deeper into the cavern, each expedition takes longer, with the latest taking more than 19 hours to complete.

==Passages renamed==
In 2008, the caverns&#x27; owners changed the names for the passages. The &quot;North Cavern&quot; was changed to &quot;Discovery Passages&quot;. and the &quot;South Cavern&quot; was changed to &quot;Hidden Passages&quot;. According to the landowners, the change in names better reflects the discovery and exploration history of the cavern and removes some confusion for guests.

==Wildlife==
There is recent evidence of bats residing in the Natural Bridge Caverns including roosting areas and accumulation of bat guano. Bracken Cave, near the Natural Bridge Caverns, is home to one of two large bat colonies in Texas. The bats that inhabit Bracken Cave are a small species called Mexican free-tailed bats. Bats control the insect population, help to pollinate plants, and are a food source for other animals, making them a valuable part of the ecosystem. The cave was the focus of a 2013 episode of the syndicated anthology television series &quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot;, hosted by Bob Phillips.

==Natural Bridge Caverns Sinkhole==

Located on the property is the Natural Bridge Caverns Sinkhole Site, an archeological site listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The location of the site is not publicly disclosed in order to preserve artifacts in their context for ongoing research.

<doc id="317705" wikidata="Q7194767" url="?curid=317705" title="Pin feather">
<text>A pin feather is a developing feather on a bird. This feather can grow as a new feather during the bird&#x27;s infancy, or grow to replace one from moulting.

The pin feather looks somewhat like a feather shaft. However, unlike a fully developed feather, the pin feather has a blood supply flowing through it; at this stage, it may also be called a blood feather. As such, if the pin feather is damaged, a bird can bleed heavily.

As the pin feather grows longer, the blood supply is concentrated in only the base of the shaft, and the tip of the shaft encases the feather itself in a waxy coating. As moulting birds preen, they remove the waxy coating, and the feather unfurls.

When the blood has receded, the term &quot;blood feather&quot; is no longer synonymous with &quot;pin feather&quot; – it can only be referred to as a pin feather.

==Growth==
Pin feathers begin to develop after the feather bud invaginates a cylinder of epidermal tissue around the base of the dermal papilla, forming the feather follicle. At the base of the feather follicle, epithelial cells proliferate to grow the epidermal collar or cylinder. As the epidermal cylinder extends through dermis, it differentiates into a protective peripheral sheath, longitudinal barb ridges, and growth plates. Over time these barb ridges lengthen helically, branch to create barbs and barbules, and fuse to form the rachis or central shaft. Moreover, the barb plate further differentiate into hooklets and cilia, while the marginal and axial plate die to form the intervening space within the feather structure.

A bird with pin feathers may be said to be &quot;in pin&quot;.

==Pet care==
During moulting, a bird may get careless and begin to chew its feathers and might accidentally damage a blood feather. To prevent this, it is necessary that the bird is given chewing toys so that it does not chew at its own feathers. Pin feathers are sensitive, and some pet birds do not enjoy being handled while moulting for this reason.

To stop bleeding from a pin feather, it is necessary to pluck the feather from its base. Bleeding must be taken care of as soon as possible to prevent too much blood loss. However, this can be difficult for a pet bird owner to do on a larger bird, so it is recommended owners have the necessary tools on hand in a first aid kit. If assistance is needed, the bird should be taken to a veterinarian as soon as possible.

<doc id="317711" wikidata="Q313494" url="?curid=317711" title="Gabriel Bethlen">
<text>Gabriel Bethlen (; 1580 – 15 November 1629) was Prince of Transylvania from 1613 to 1629 and Duke of Opole from 1622 to 1625. He was also King-elect of Hungary from 1620 to 1621, but he never took control of the whole kingdom. Bethlen, supported by the Ottomans, led his Calvinist principality against the Habsburgs and their Catholic allies.

== Early life ==

Gabriel was the elder of the two sons of Farkas Bethlen de Iktár and Druzsiána Lázár de Szárhegy. Gabriel was born in his father&#x27;s estate, Marosillye (now Ilia in Romania), in 1580. Farkas Bethlen was a Hungarian nobleman who lost his ancestral estate, Iktár (now Ictar-Budinț in Romania), due to the Ottoman occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary. Stephen Báthory, Prince of Transylvania, granted Marosillye to him and made him captain-general of the principality. Druzsiána Lázár was descended from a Székely noble family. Both Farkas Bethlen and his wife died in 1591, leaving their two sons, Gabriel and Stephen, orphaned.

The brothers were put under the guardianship of their maternal uncle, András Lázár de Szárhegy. They lived in the Lázár Castle in Szárhegy in Székely Land (now Lăzarea in Romania) for years. Gabriel&#x27;s court historian, Gáspár Bojti Veres, described Lázár as a &quot;grumpy and fierce&quot; soldier who did not care much about their formal education.

According Gabriel&#x27;s first extant letter (from 1593), Sigismund Báthory, Prince of Transylvania, seized the brothers&#x27; estates &quot;at the word of many coaxing people&quot; without paying a compensation to them in 1591 or 1592, but a &quot;few primary kinsmen&quot; convinced the prince to offer restitution or other landed property to them. Gabriel also mentioned in the letter that he decided to visit the prince&#x27;s court in Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania).

== Career ==

=== Beginnings ===

Modern historians try to reconstruct the major events of Gabriel&#x27;s youth based on sources (primarily memoirs and letters) completed decades later, because only two documents written between 1593 and 1602 mentioned him. One of the later sources is Gabriel&#x27;s own letter from 1628, in which he stated that Stephen Bocskai had raised him and &quot;placed great credence&quot; in him. Gabriel also stated that Bocskai was his &quot;kin&quot;. Another important source was written by Gabriel&#x27;s retainer, Pál Háportoni Forró, who stated that Gabriel had held &quot;great and honorable offices&quot; and performed &quot;the greatly laborious duties of emissary&quot; in his youth. Based on these sources, modern historians assume that Bocskai boosted Gabriel&#x27;s career in Sigismund Báthory&#x27;s court, but no contemporaneous document mentioned his presence in the prince&#x27;s retinue.

Sigismund Báthory joined the anti-Ottoman Holy League of Pope Clement VIII and broke into Ottoman territory in the summer of 1595. According to historian József Barcza, Gabriel gained his first direct experience of warfare fighting against the Ottomans in the Battle of Giurgiu in Wallachia in 1595. After a series of Ottoman victories, Báthory abdicated in return for the Silesian duchies of Opole and Racibórz in 1597, enabling the commissioners of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph (who was also king of Royal Hungary) to take possession of Transylvania.

=== Anarchy ===

Sigismund Báthory regretted his abdication and returned to Transylvania in August 1598. He sent Bocskai to Prague to start negotiations with Rudolph in January 1599. According to a scholarly theory, Gabriel Bethlen accompanied Bocskai to Prague. Historian József Barcza also says, Gabriel must have realized around that time that the Habsburg monarchs were unable to defend Transylvania against the Ottomans. Gabriel himself stated that he visited Prague in the retinue of Sigismund Báthory at an unspecified date.

Gabriel supported Andrew Báthory, who mounted the throne with Polish assistance after Sigismund again abdicated in 1599. Michael the Brave, Prince of Wallachia, broke into Transylvania and defeated Andrew in the Battle of Sellenberk (at present-day Șelimbăr in Romania) on 8 October 1599. Gabriel received wounds in the battle and his wounds healed slowly. Michael the Brave was expelled from Transylvania by Rudolph&#x27;s commander, Giorgio Basta. During the following years, Transylvania was regularly pillaged both by Basta&#x27;s unpaid mercenaries, and by Ottoman and Crimean Tatar troops. Gabriel and his brother, Stephen, divided their inherited estates, with Gabriel receiving Marosillye. Their agreement also refers to the anarchic situation, mentioning the possibility that &quot;either pagan or some godless prince or the governor&quot; would seize Gabriel&#x27;s property.

Gabriel joined the Transylvanian noblemen who rose up against Basta. Sigismund Báthory (who had again returned to Transylvania) granted Gabriel and his brother landed property in Arad County in June 1602. The army of the rebellious noblemen was annihilated near Tövis (now Teiuș in Romania) on 2 July 1602. After the battle, he swam over the Maros River and fled to Temesvár in the Ottoman Empire (now Timișoara in Romania). He forged letters which suggested that the leading Transylvanian noblemen supported Moses Székely to persuade the Ottomans to support Székely, according to the contemporaneous Ambrus Somogyi. When Székely broke into Transylvania in March 1603, Gabriel was the commander of his vanguard. Székelys&#x27; troops conquered most fortresses along the Maros and laid siege to Gyulafehérvár. During the siege, the princely palace burned. Székely was installed as prince in May, but Radu Șerban, Prince of Wallachia, annihilated his army near Barcarozsnyó (now Râșnov in Romania) on 17 July. Székely was killed in the battlefield, and his supporters (among them Gabriel) fled to the Ottoman Empire.

The Transylvanian refugees started to regard Gabriel as their leader. They sent a delegation to Constantinople in August, asking the permission of the Ottoman grand vizier to elect Gabriel prince and seeking Ottoman assistance to their return to Transylvania. The grand vizier granted the permission, but one of the refugees, Boldizsár Szilvási, prevented Gabriel&#x27;s election, pointing out that a prince could not be elected by a group of refugees, but by the Diet of Transylvania.

=== Bocskai&#x27;s supporter ===

Gabriel decided to persuade the wealthy Stephen Bocskai to rise up against Rudolph&#x27;s commissioners. After royal troops attacked the refugees&#x27; camp near Temesvár on 13 September 1604, rumours about the capture of a secret correspondence between Bethlen and Bocskai began circulating. Fearing reprisals, Bocskai withdrew to his fortress at Sólyomkő (now Şoimeni in Romania) and make preparations to resist. He hired irregular Hajdú troops and defeated a royal army on 15 October.

Bocskai took possession of Kassa (now Košice in Slovakia) on 11 November. Soon after, Gabriel gave the &quot;ahidnâme&quot; (or charter) in which the Ottoman Sultan, Ahmed I, styled Bocskai as prince of Transylvania. The delegates of the noblemen and the Székelys elected Bocskai prince on 21 February 1605. According to a letter of Bethlen, Bocskai ordered him to capture &quot;certain castles&quot;, for which he had to postpone his marriage in May.

Gabriel finally married his bride, Zsuzsanna Károlyi, in August 1605. Bocskai granted the domain of Vajdahunyad (now Hunedoara in Romania) to him. The prince also made him the perpetual ispán (or head) of Hunyad County.

Bethlen was a Calvinist. He helped György Káldy, a Jesuit, translate and print the Bible. He composed hymns and from 1625, employed Johannes Thesselius as kapellmeister.

=== Prince of Transylvania ===
In 1605, Bethlen supported Stephen Bocskay and his successor Gabriel Báthory (1608–1613). Bethlen later fell out with Báthory and fled to the Ottoman Empire.

In 1613, after Báthory was murdered, the Ottomans installed Bethlen as Prince of Transylvania and this was endorsed on 13 October 1613 by the Transylvanian Diet at Kolozsvár (Cluj-Napoca). In 1615, after the Peace of Tyrnau, Bethlen was recognised by Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor.

Bethlen&#x27;s rule was one of enlightened absolutism. He developed mines and industry and nationalised many branches of Transylvania&#x27;s foreign trade. His agents bought goods at fixed prices and sold them abroad at profit. In his capital, in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), Bethlen built a grand new palace. Bethlen was a patron of the arts and the Calvinist church, giving hereditary nobility to Protestant priests. Bethlen also encouraged learning by founding the Bethlen Gabor College, encouraging the enrollment of Hungarian academics and teachers and sending Transylvanian students to the Protestant universities of England, the Dutch Republic, and the Protestant principalities of Germany. He also ensured the right of serfs&#x27; children to be educated.

=== Anti-Habsburg insurrection ===
Bethlen maintained an efficient standing army of mercenaries. While keeping relations with the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman Empire), he sought to gain lands to the north and west. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, he attacked the Habsburgs of Royal Hungary (1619–1626). Bethlen opposed the autocracy of the Habsburgs; persecution of Protestants in Royal Hungary; the violation of the Peace of Vienna of 1606; and Habsburg alliances with the Ottomans and George Drugeth (1633-1661), the captain of Upper Hungary.

In August 1619, Bethlen invaded Royal Hungary. In September, he took Kassa (Košice) where Protestant supporters declared him the leader of Hungary and protector of Protestants. He gained control of Upper Hungary (present-day Slovakia). In September 1619, after refusing to convert to Calvinism, the Jesuits Marko Križevcanin, Stephen Pongracz and Melchior Grodeczki were martyred under Bethlen&#x27;s authority.&quot; The three were later canonized by the Catholic Church.

In October 1619, Bethlen took Pressburg (Pozsony, today&#x27;s Bratislava), where the Palatine of Hungary ceded the Holy Crown of Hungary. However, Bethlen, together with Jindřich Matyáš of Thurn-Valsassina, count of the Moravian and Czech estates, did not take Vienna and, in November, the forces of George Drugeth and Polish mercenaries (lisowczycy) won the Battle of Humenné and forced Bethlen to leave Austria and Upper Hungary.

Bethlen negotiated for peace at Pressburg, Kassa (now Košice) and Besztercebánya (now Banská Bystrica). In January 1620, without the Czechs, Bethlen received 13 counties in the east of Royal Hungary. On 20 August 1620, he was elected King of Hungary at the Diet of Besztercebánya and in September 1620, war with the Habsburgs resumed.

After defeating the Czechs on 8 November 1620 at the Battle of White Mountain, Ferdinand II persecuted the Protestant nobility of Bohemia. Between May and June 1621, he regained Pressburg and the central mining towns. Bethlen again sued for peace and on 31 December 1621, the Peace of Nikolsburg was made. Bethlen renounced his royal title on the condition that Hungarian Protestants were given religious freedoms and were included in a general diet within six months. Bethlen was given the title of &quot;Imperial Prince&quot; (of Hungarian Transylvania), seven counties around the Upper Tisza River and the fortresses of Tokaj, Munkács (now Mukacheve), and Ecsed (Nagyecsed), and a duchy in Silesia.
In 1623 - 1624 and 1626, Bethlen, allied with the anti-Habsburg Protestants, made campaigns against Ferdinand in Upper Hungary. The first campaign ended with the Peace of Vienna (1624), the second by the Peace of Pressburg (1626). After the second campaign, Bethlen offered as rapprochement to the court of Vienna an alliance against the Ottomans and his marriage to an archduchess of Austria, but Ferdinand rejected his overtures. On his return from Vienna, Bethlen wed Catherine of Brandenburg, the daughter of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg. His brother-in-law was Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.
== Death ==

Bethlen died on 15 November 1629. His second wife, Catherine of Brandenburg, became Princess Regnant of Transylvania.
His first wife, , had died in 1622. 

Bethlen&#x27;s state correspondence survives as a historical document.

<text>Adolf Anton Wilhelm Wohlbrück (19 November 18969 August 1967) was an Austrian actor who settled in the United Kingdom under the name Anton Walbrook. A popular performer in Austria and pre-war Germany, he left Germany in 1936 out of concerns for his own safety and established a career in British cinema. Walbrook is perhaps best known for his roles in the original British film of &quot;Gaslight&quot;, &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; (as Prince Albert).

==Early life==
Walbrook was born in Vienna, Austria, as Adolf Wohlbrück. He was the son of Gisela Rosa (Cohn) and Adolf Ferdinand Bernhard Hermann Wohlbrück. He was descended from ten generations of actors, though his father broke with tradition and was a circus clown. He attended a monastery school and considered becoming a monk, but eventually decided to become an actor.

Wohlbrück moved to Berlin to study at the Deutsches Theater under Austro-German director Max Reinhardt. His career was temporarily interrupted by the First World War, during which he was captured in France and spent time in a POW camp. 

==Career==
After the war, Wohlbrück built up a career in German theatre and cinema, with the support of his friend Hermine Körner. In the 1930s he was one of Germany&#x27;s most popular actors. However, as the Nazis came to power, Wohlbrück realized that he could not stay in Germany for long, as he risked being persecuted by the Nazis due to his Jewish mother and his homosexuality. When Nazi Germany absorbed Austria in the 1938 Anschluss, the Austrian option was taken off the table as well.

In 1936, Wohlbrück went to Hollywood to reshoot dialogue for the 1937 multinational &quot;The Soldier and the Lady&quot;, in which he portrayed the Jules Verne hero &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot;, and changed his name from Adolf Wohlbrück to Anton Walbrook. Ironically, due in part to his popularity in Germany (which persisted through the early parts of the Nazi regime), some German emigres in Hollywood suspected that he was a Nazi spy, and some Jewish-American groups threatened to boycott his films. Although RKO convinced the Jewish organizations to lift the boycott by pointing out Walbrook&#x27;s actual ethnic heritage, the damage was done. He moved to London in 1937, settling down in an area with many German-speaking emigres. One of his neighbours was director Emeric Pressburger, who later cast him in some of his most famous roles. He acquired British citizenship in 1947.

In Britain, Walbrook continued working as an actor, specialising in playing continental Europeans. He &quot;steer[ed] away from the dangerously sexy screen persona of his German career to the image of a passionate spokesman for pan-European liberalism.&quot; He played Otto in the first London production of &quot;Design for Living&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre in January 1939 (later transferring to the Savoy Theatre), and running for 233 performances, opposite Diana Wynyard as Gilda and Rex Harrison as Leo. In 1952 he appeared at the Coliseum as Cosmo Constantine in &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, also participating alongside Billie Worth, Jeff Warren and Shani Wallis on the EMI cast recording. Producer-director Herbert Wilcox cast him as Prince Albert in &quot;Victoria the Great&quot; (1937) and its sequel &quot;Sixty Glorious Years&quot; (1938). In &quot;Dangerous Moonlight&quot; (1941), a romantic melodrama, he was a Polish pianist torn over whether to return home. 

Thorold Dickinson cast Walbrook in &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1940), in the role played by Charles Boyer in the later Hollywood remake. One of Walbrook&#x27;s most unusual films was Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (1949), a Gothic thriller based on the Alexander Pushkin short story, in which he co-starred with Edith Evans.

In 1941 Walbrook began collaborating with Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, for which he is now best remembered. In &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941) he played a leader of a Hutterite community in Canada. In &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943) he played the role of the dashing, intense military officer Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, a sympathetic German refugee from the Nazi regime. He also portrayed the tyrannical ballet impresario Lermontov in &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948). His &quot;Red Shoes&quot; co-star Moira Shearer recalled Walbrook was a loner on set, often wearing dark glasses, as in his character costume in the film, and eating alone.

After the war, he worked in some continental productions, working with Max Ophüls as the ringmaster in &quot;La Ronde&quot; (1950) and Ludwig I, King of Bavaria in &quot;Lola Montès&quot;.

Walbrook retired from feature films in 1958 and moved to Germany, where he worked as a stage and television actor during the 1960s. 

==Death==
In 1967, Walbrook suffered a heart attack on stage while acting in a theatrical production. He survived but later died at the home of actress Hansi Burg in the Garatshausen district of Feldafing, Bavaria, Germany. His ashes were interred in the churchyard of St. John&#x27;s Church, Hampstead, London, as he had wished in his will. He is buried with his partner Eugene Edwards, a London florist, although Edwards&#x27; name is not on the tombstone.

A biography of Walbrook, penned by James Downs, was published in 2020.

== Legacy ==
American director Wes Anderson is a great fan of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, and once boasted that he knew all of Walbrook&#x27;s dialogue in that film by heart. Ralph Fiennes, who played the dandyish hotel concierge Gustave H. in Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot;, said that Anderson asked him to study Walbrook&#x27;s work in &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; to prepare for his performance. In addition, Gustave&#x27;s mustache is based on Walbrook&#x27;s.

<text>The Llano Uplift is a geologically ancient, low geologic dome that is about in diameter and located mostly in Llano, Mason, San Saba, Gillespie, and Blanco counties, Texas. It consists of an island-like exposure of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks surrounded by outcrops of Paleozoic and Cretaceous sedimentary strata. At their widest, the exposed Precambrian rocks extend about westward from the valley of the Colorado River and beneath a broad, gentle topographic basin drained by the Llano River. The subdued topographic basin is underlain by Precambrian rocks and bordered by a discontinuous rim of flat-topped hills. These hills are the dissected edge of the Edwards Plateau, which consist of overlying Cretaceous sedimentary strata. Within this basin and along its margin are down-faulted blocks and erosional remnants of Paleozoic strata which form prominent hills.

The Llano Uplift is well known for its large, granite domes, such as Enchanted Rock. The area includes several major rock quarries like Granite Mountain that mine the distinctive pink granite. Further, the area contains the only known deposits of llanite.

In 1992, the Texas Department of Health identified the area as one of four regions with high potential for the presence of hazardous levels of radon gas.

== Geology ==

The Llano Uplift can be considered an uplift by either its pattern on a geological or structural map of the top of the Precambrian rocks. It qualifies as an uplift because it consists of an extensive Precambrian basement high that is exposed by virtue of its surface lying significantly above in elevation the surface of surrounding Precambrian basement. However, the Llano Uplift may not have been ever uplifted as a distinct entity and at a single time as a basement high. Rather, it formed by the areas surrounding it having subsided around it and the Precambrian rocks underlying it having been elevated by the formation and interaction of multiple geologic structures at multiple times during the Carboniferous and Cretaceous periods.

=== Precambrian rocks ===
Precambrian rocks directly underlie the surface of the central and topographically lowest part of the Llano Uplift within a low-relief basin drained of the Llano River and eastward to the valley of the Colorado River. These rocks consist of about of Middle Proterozoic crystalline basement exposed in an erosional window eroded through overlying Phanerozoic sedimentary strata. The Precambrian basement is cut by numerous normal and oblique-slip faults, the result of the Ouachita Orogeny, that juxtapose Paleozoic strata with the Precambrian rocks.

The Precambrian rocks consist of multiply deformed, metasedimentary, metavolcanic and metaplutonic rocks that range in age from 1.37 to 1.23 Ga. These metamorphic rocks have been intruded by 1.13 to 1.07 Ga, syntectonic to post-tectonic granites. These rocks can be divided into three fault-bounded blocks of strata called &quot;domains&quot;. They are called the &quot;Valley Spring&quot;, &quot;Packsaddle&quot;, and &quot;Coal Creek&quot; domains. Each of these domains contain distinctive rock types and ages and were either erupted, intruded, or deposited in three separate areas and later tectonically juxtaposed during the Grenville Orogeny. The &quot;Valley spring domain&quot; consists mainly of gneiss that is composed of quartz and microcline feldspar with minor biotite and hornblende. Likely, this gneiss consists of highly metamorphosed sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks that include rhyolite lava flows and ash-flow tuffs; igneous intrusions; and arkose interbedded with minor limestone, and shale. The age of these metamorphic rocks range from range from 1.29 to 1.23 Ga. The &quot;Packsaddle domain&quot; consists mainly of schists composed of hornblende, biotite, muscovite, and actinolite; marbles and calc-silicate rocks; quartzites; and quart-feldspar gneiss. These rocks were likely originally marine limestone, shale, and sandstone interbedded with mafic and felsic volcanic rocks and intrusive sills. They date from 1.27 to 1.25 Ga. Granitic sills that intrude these rocks have been dated from 1.255 to 1.250 Ga. The &quot;Coal Creek domain&quot; consists of a -long mass of serpentinite (The Coal Creek Serpentinite) that is surrounded by meta-igneous quartz-plagioclase gneiss of the Big Branch Gneiss. The gneiss has been dated at 1.33 to 1.30 Ga and was metamorphosed about 1.29 Ga, earlier than any other Llano metamorphic rocks. Coal Creek domain also contains diorite plutons, gabbro, amphibolite, mafic schist, minor talc, and smaller serpentinite bodies, all of which were metamorphosed about 1.26 Ga. The Coal Creek domain appears to represent fragments of an island arc with a slice of oceanic mantle faulted into it.

After 1.2 Ga, a global cycle of continental collision and the resulting mountain formation, globally called the Grenville orogeny, and locally called the Llano Orogeny, tectonically shoved and interleaved together these strata. They were also further altered by metamorphism into the rocks that outcrop today in the Llano Uplift. Large granitic plutons that locally form a large percentage of the outcrop in some areas and a llanite dike also intruded them. During the 400-million year interval between the emplacement of llanite and the start of Middle Cambrian sedimentation, erosion removed several kilometers of Precambrian rock.

=== Lower Paleozoic (Cambrian and Ordovician) ===
Within and around the Llano uplift are erosional remnants and down-faulted blocks of Lower Paleozoic sedimentary strata. Within the Llano Uplift, these remnants and fault blocks often form prominent hills. The Lower Paleozoic strata are composed of over of Cambrian sandstones, limestones, and dolomites of the Moore Hollow Group and Lower Ordovician limestone and dolomite of the Ellenburger Group. The Moore Hollow Group which consists of the Hickory sandstone, Cap Mountain limestone, and Lion Mountain sandstone, and the Wilberns Formation, which consists of sandstone, limestone, shale, and an upper mixture of limestone and dolomite. The Ellenburger Group is an incomplete sequence of Lower Ordovician strata, which are divided, from the base up, into the Tanyard, Gorman, and Honeycut formations. These formations contain limestones and dolomites, which are typically nonglauconitic and sparingly fossiliferous. An erosional, pre-Devonian paleosurface with well-developed paleokarst truncates the Ellenberger Group such that it thins from a thickness of in the southeastern corner of the Llano region to only in the northwestern corner of the region.

The Moore Hollow Group records the advancing of a sea from the southeast across eroded Precambrian rocks during Middle to Late Cambrian times and subsequent burial beneath coastal and nearshore marine sediments. The Cambrian sea spread northward across the eroded surface an area of Precambrian rocks that had a local relief as great as . As a result, sediments composed of locally derived residuum, often wind-abraded accumulated as a thin, discontinuous cobble conglomerate overlying Precambrian strata at the base of the Moore Hollow Group. Following the deposition of the uppermost Cambrian limestones and dolomites, the Lower Ordovician Ellenburger Group (composed of the Tanyard, Gorman, and Honeycut Formations) accumulated within shallow-water carbonate platforms. At the end of the Lower Ordovician, the Central Texas region was tilted eastwards and exposed to subaerial erosion and karstification.

Possible reworked Middle Ordovician conodonts (Chirognathus) have been found in younger strata and a pocket of Upper Ordovician limestone, the Burnam Limestone, is preserved in a collapse structure in Burnet County. The reworked conodonts and the Burnam Limestone indicate that the region of the Llano Uplift was likely either partially and briefly submerged during the Middle and Upper Ordovician only to have the sediments deposited during these inundations removed by later erosion.

=== Middle Paleozoic (Silurian and Devonian) ===
Within the Llano Uplift, fossiliferous Silurian and Devonian strata occur preserved as the fills of solution and collapse structures that vary in size from large structural sinks to crack fillings a few inches or less in width. Isolated deposits of fossiliferous Starcke Limestone preserved in ancient sinkholes developed in the Ellenberger Group provide definite evidence of the Llano region having been inundated by marine waters at least once during the Silurian Period. Fossiliferous Devonian limestones of various types that are preserved in cave fills, collapse depressions, and other paleokarst features develop in the Ellenberger Group also demonstrate that the Llano region was also episodically inundated by marine waters during the Devonian period. During periods of subaerial exposure, these deposits were largely stripped from the region of the Llano Uplift. The pockets and remnants of Devonian strata preserved in paleokarst included the Bear Spring Formation, Pillar Bluff Limestone, Stribling Formation, and, in part, the Houy Formation. Breccias found at the base of the base of the pockets of Devonian strata likely represent a mixture of residuum developed by the subaerial, in situ dissolution of underlying limestones and dolomites and residuum eroded and redeposited by an advancing marine shoreline.

=== Late Paleozoic (Carboniferous and Permian) ===
Like the Devonian strata found in the Llano Uplift, early Carboniferous (Mississippian) strata, the youngest black shale of the Houy Formation, the crinoidal limestone of Chappel Limestone and the black shale Barnett Formation consist of at most a few meters of strata preserved within collapse structures and other paleokarst. As in case of the Devonian and Silurian strata found within the Llano uplift, these strata represent brief periods of inundation of the region by shallow epicontinental seas and marine sedimentation alternating with long periods of terrestrial exposure during which these marine sediments were almost completely removed by erosion.

Late Carboniferous ( Lower Pennsylvanian ) strata are in large part exposed in three non-contiguous areas. First, an isolated areal exposure of Smithwick Shale and underling Marble Falls Limestone occurs near Marble Falls, Texas, area in southwestern Burnet County. Second, in southwestern Mason County and northeastern Kimble County, late Carboniferous Marble Falls Limestone overlying relatively thin early Carboniferous strata is exposed within a half dozen, isolated fault blocks on the southwestern periphery of the Llano region. Finally, late Carboniferous are exposed as within a triangular shaped region that is bisected by the Colorado River along the northwest, north, and northeast periphery of the Llano region in McCulloch, San Saba, and Lampasas counties. In this area, Marble Falls Limestone, Smithwick Shale, and lower Strawn Group are well exposed. The strata of the lower Strawn Group are truncated by an erosional unconformity that is overlain by much younger Cretaceous strata.

The succession of Carboniferous strata within and adjacent to the Llano Uplift records the pronounced subsidence and filling of the adjacent Fort Worth Basin by the westward progradation of delta and associated fluvial systems from the uplifted Ouachita Mountains to the east. The Chappell Limestone and Barnett Shale represent episodic early Carboniferous inundations of the Llano region followed its submergence and formation of a carbonate platform within which the Marble Falls Limestone accumulated as a lateral equivalent to deeper water Smithwick Shale. As the Fort Worth Basin deepened and sank in responses to the Ouachita Orogeny, Smithwick Shale was deposited on former sites of Marble Falls sedimentation within the Llano Uplift region. In the deeper part of the Llano region, basin-fill shale and submarine fan deposits that form the lower Strawn Group accumulated. As the basin filled during the remainder of the Carboniferous and Permian, fluvial-deltaic sediments and associated shallow marine continental shelf deposits of the upper Strawn, Canyon, and Cisco group accumulated within the Fort Worth Basin.

=== Mesozoic ===
The only Mesozoic rocks that are known in the Llano region are those of the Cretaceous system. Throughout Triassic and Jurassic periods, the Llano region was eroded. The accumulation of Triassic, terrestrial red beds of the Dockham Group may have reached to the western edge Llano region. However, they were eroded back to its present position and underlying strata eroded during the Triassic and Jurassic in response regional tilting and uplift.

By the time that the regions of the Llano Uplift was slowly covered by Cretaceous sedimentary deposits, it had been reduced by erosion to a low relief erosion surface termed the Wichita paleoplain. What little research has been conducted on the Wichita paleoplain estimates that as much as of relief exists on this surface cut into the underlying strata. During the Cretaceous, this surface was progressively buried by the accumulation of fluvial and coastal sediments of the Trinity Group and later by the Walnut, Comanche Peak, and Edwards formations.

=== Cenozoic ===
Erosion that has occurred since the withdrawal of Cretaceous seas has resulted in a topographic inversion. As a result, the oldest and structurally highest rocks tend to occur at the lowest topographic elevations. Where the Cretaceous rocks rim the Llano uplift, a sharp topographic rise or escarpment is common.

== Central Mineral region ==
The Llano Uplift region is also called the Central Mineral region of Texas because of the occurrence of the great variety of minerals found in and the numerous ore prospecting pits dug into exposed Precambrian rocks and Lower Paleozoic strata. Over the decades, a few small mines have yielded yttrium and other rare-earth minerals, magnetite, feldspar, vermiculite, serpentine, and gem quality topaz. Briefly, galena as lead ore was mined from limestone lying unconformably upon granite knobs that were once hills before being submerged by rising relative sea level in the Cambrian. Minor showings of gold, silver, copper, tin, bismuth, molybdenum, tungsten, and uranium minerals have been found and explored in prospecting pits. Before it closed in 1980, the Southwestern Graphite mine northwest of Burnet, Texas, was the only major producer of high-purity graphite in North America for several decades. In the past large quantities of soapstone were excavated from outcrops south of Llano, Texas, and ground for use as insecticide carrier and inert filler in various products. The principal mineral resources currently produced from Central Mineral region consist of fracturing sand (“Frac sand”), crushed stone, and building stone. Granite has been quarried from almost innumerable localities and the active production of dimension stone continues today from a dome of coarse pink Town Mountain Granite near Marble Falls, Texas.

<text>Canton of Nidwalden or Nidwald ( ; ; ; ) is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of eleven municipalities and the seat of the government and parliament is in Stans. It is traditionally considered a &quot;half-canton&quot;, the other half being Obwalden.

Nidwalden lies in Central Switzerland. It borders the canton of Obwalden to the west, the cantons of Lucerne and Schwyz to the north, the canton of Uri to the east and the canton of Bern to the south. The canton is essentially in the Alps, south of Lake Lucerne.

It is one of the smallest cantons, the population is 40,287 (in 2007). The largest town is Stans, followed by Hergiswil and Buochs.

Together with Obwalden, Nidwalden was part of the forest canton of Unterwalden, one of the three participants in the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy, named in the Pact of Brunnen of 1315 with Uri and Schwyz. The division of Unterwalden into two separate territories, Obwalden and Nidwalden, appears to develop over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries.

==History==
The earliest traces of human settlement date to the Neolithic with sites found near Stansstad that are from 4000 to 3100 BC. The same sites, near Stansstad, also contain Late Bronze Age (1400–1100 BC) artifacts, with additional Bronze Age sites near Hergiswil and Ennetmoos. A La Tène (500–100 BC) grave for a 10-year-old girl has been found in Stans. Based on these finds, it appears that the Nidwalden region has been settled since the 1st millennium BC.

During the Roman Empire Ob and Nidwalden were inhabited by a Gallo-Roman or Celtic population. While there are few artifacts from the population, many names of the towns, rivers and mountains have either Celtic or Gallo-Roman roots. By the 8th century the Alemanni entered the valleys of present-day Nidwalden and intermingled. At this time a Roman Catholic church was built in Stans, most likely founded by an Alemanni noble family. The church in Stans would remain until the 10th century when it was replaced by a church in Buochs.

Initially the land was owned by a number of noble families and abbeys. But by the late 13th century the major powers in Nidwalden had shrunk to three: the Habsburgs, Murbach Abbey and Engelberg Abbey. In 1291 Rudolph of Habsburg bought Obwalden from Murbach Abbey. In response the people of Nidwalden (Obwalden joined shortly before the document was signed, the two-halves forming Unterwalden) joined Uri and Schwyz to form an alliance which is considered the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy.

At the time there was no state, but towards the end of the 14th century early forms of government were established. This included institutionalized assemblies and courts. In the 14th and 15th century the people of Nidwalden joined the people of Obwalden to discuss important matters, but the two cantons were never really one. For example, Obwalden did not participate in the annexation of Bellinzona, Riviera and Blenio areas (today located in the canton of Ticino).

Under the Helvetic Republic imposed in 1798 by French Revolutionary troops, Switzerland became a united country. The ideas of the French Revolution were not popular in some parts of the Swiss nation including Nidwalden. The cantons were accustomed to self-government and many resented the limits on the freedom of worship in particular. When rebel forces threatened the Republic, Nidwalden was attacked by French troops on 9 September 1798. The canton&#x27;s infrastructure was badly damaged and at least 400 people were killed.

After the end of Napoleonic rule in 1814, most of the changes were reverted. Only in 1877 did Nidwalden introduce a new constitution. The open assembly (&quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;) was abolished in 1997.

==Geography==
Nidwalden is located in the centre of Switzerland. To the north it is bounded by the Lake Lucerne (&quot;Vierwaldstättersee&quot;), to all other directions by mountain chains (Urner Alps). The area of the canton is of which about 40% is inhabited or used for farming. Forests occupy about one third of the canton with about one quarter being considered unproductive (mountains or glaciers).

=== Climate and energy policy ===
WWF rating: 1.9 (&quot;blocked&quot;)

The World Wildlife Fund commissioned a study into the energy policies of all Swiss cantons . No canton was given the highest possible rating of 6, and Nidwalden came out with one of the lowest in the country, above only Zug and Schwyz. Six indicators were used for the assessment, namely cantonal goals, energy efficiency requirements, renewable energy regulations, financial subsidies, energy planning of the individual municipalities, and the &quot;Gebäudeenergieausweis&quot;. The highest rating can only be given to cantons which are on their way to meeting the requirements of the Paris Agreement in each area.

==Municipalities==
There are eleven municipalities: Beckenried, Buochs, Dallenwil, Emmetten, Ennetbürgen, Ennetmoos, Hergiswil, Oberdorf, Stans, Stansstad and Wolfenschiessen. The capital is Stans.

== Economy ==
Up to the 20th century Nidwalden was dominated by agriculture. Cattle and cheese were exported mainly to northern Italy. Around 1500, many people in Nidwalden worked as mercenary soldiers.

From the middle of the 19th century onwards, trade, industry and tourism gained momentum. Nevertheless, until the middle of the 20th century, agriculture dominated the canton. Today a great number of small and middle-sized businesses dominate the economy. The largest employer is the airplane constructor Pilatus. The small and middle-sized businesses work in a wide range of areas. Many specialize in machine construction, medical equipment, international trade, optics and electronics.

Traditional areas such as forestry and agriculture are still of importance. Agriculture is specialized in cattle and dairy farming. The farms are still run by individual families.

In recent years, Nidwalden is becoming an increasingly common place to live and work. This is caused by its low taxes, its central location between Zürich and Milan, and its natural environment.

===Tourism===

Because of its mountainous geography, tourism is important in Nidwalden. The lake and the mountains attract many tourists, both during the winter and the summer. Major resorts include Klewenalp, Stanserhorn (mountain), the region around Bannalp, and Bürgenstock.

==Culture==
Traditional culture in Nidwalden has been kept alive by many local organisations. There is traditional music, yodeling, dances, theaters and festivals. There are also a number of modern cultural events, such a concerts and galleries.

<text>Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer (21 February 1801 – 10 February 1888) was a German Orientalist.

==Biography==
He was born at Schandau, Saxony. From 1819 to 1824, he studied theology and Oriental languages at Leipzig, subsequently continuing his studies in Paris, where he continued his studies of the Arabic, Turkish and Persian languages under de Sacy. From 1831 to 1835, he taught at one of the Dresden high schools. In 1836, he was appointed professor of oriental languages at Leipzig University, and retained this post till his death, in spite of invitations to accept similar positions in Saint Petersburg and Berlin.

Fleischer was one of the eight foreign members of the French Academy of Inscriptions and a knight of the German Ordre &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; (1868). He was a member of many German and foreign scientific societies, possessor of honorary degrees from the universities of Königsberg, Prague, Saint Petersburg, Dorpat and Edinburgh, and one of the founders of the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft.

In 1870 he received a combined medal (together with Brockhaus, Pott and Rödiger) in occasion of the 25th anniversary of the DMG.

He died at Leipzig.

==Writings==
His most important works were editions of Abu&#x27;l-Fida&#x27;s &quot;Historia ante-Islamica&quot; (1831—1834), Al-Zamakhshari&#x27;s &quot;Golden Necklaces&quot; (Leipzig, 1835), and of Al-Baydawi&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Koran&quot; (1846–1848). He compiled a catalogue of the Oriental manuscripts in the royal library at Dresden (1831); published an edition and German translation of &quot;Ali&#x27;s Hundred Sayings&quot; (1837); the continuation of Christian Maxmilian Habicht&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Thousand and One Nights&quot; (vols. ix-xii, 1842–1843); and an edition of Mirza Muhammed Ibrahim&#x27;s &quot;Persian Grammar&quot; (1847). He also wrote &quot;Hermes Trismegistus an die Menschliche Seele&quot; (Leipzig, 1870), &quot;Kleinere Schriften&quot; (3 vols., Leipzig, 1885–88), and an account of the Arabic, Turkish and Persian manuscripts at the town library in Leipzig.

==Fleischer on the Nature of Arabic Language==
&quot;Die Frage ist für uns nicht: was ist das reinste, correcteste und schönste, sondern was ist überhaupt Arabisch?&quot; (in: Kleinere Schriften, Leipzig, 1888, Vol. iii, p. 156).

i.e. &quot;The question for us is not: What is the purest, the most beautiful and correct Arabic, but what is Arabic in general?&quot;

<text>A refrain (from Vulgar Latin &quot;refringere&quot;, &quot;to repeat&quot;, and later from Old French &quot;refraindre&quot;) is the line or lines that are repeated in music or in poetry—the &quot;chorus&quot; of a song. Poetic fixed forms that feature refrains include the villanelle, the virelay, and the sestina.

In popular music, the refrain or chorus may contrast with the verse melodically, rhythmically, and harmonically; it may assume a higher level of dynamics and activity, often with added instrumentation. Chorus form, or strophic form, is a sectional and/or additive way of structuring a piece of music based on the repetition of one formal section or block played repeatedly.

==Usage in history==
Although repeats of refrains may use different words, refrains are made recognizable by reusing the same melody (when sung as music) and by preserving any rhymes. For example, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; contains a refrain which is introduced by a different phrase in each verse, but which always ends:

O&#x27;er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.

A similar refrain is found in the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, which affirms in successive verses that &quot;Our God&quot;, or &quot;His Truth&quot;, is &quot;marching on.&quot;

Refrains usually, but not always, come at the end of the verse. Some songs, especially ballads, incorporate refrains (or &quot;burdens&quot;) into each verse. For example, one version of the traditional ballad &quot;The Cruel Sister&quot; includes a refrain mid-verse:

There lived a lady by the North Sea shore,
:&quot;Lay the bent to the bonny broom&quot;
Two daughters were the babes she bore.
:&quot;Fa la la la la la la la la.&quot;
As one grew bright as is the sun,
:&quot;Lay the bent to the bonny broom&quot;
So coal black grew the other one.
:&quot;Fa la la la la la la la.&quot;

(Note: the refrain of &quot;Lay the bent to the bonny broom&quot; is not traditionally associated with the ballad of &quot;The Cruel Sister&quot; (Child #10). This was the work of &#x27;pop-folk&#x27; group Pentangle on their 1970 LP &quot;Cruel Sister&quot; which has subsequently been picked up by many folk singers as being traditional. Both the melody and the refrain come from the ballad known as &quot;Riddles Wisely Expounded&quot; (Child #1).)

Here, the refrain is syntactically independent of the narrative poem in the song, and has no obvious relationship to its subject, and indeed little inherent meaning at all. The device can also convey material which relates to the subject of the poem. Such a refrain is found in Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Troy Town&quot;:

Phrases of apparent nonsense in refrains (&quot;Lay the bent to the bonny broom?&quot;), and syllables such as &quot;fa la la&quot;, familiar from the Christmas carol &quot;Deck the Halls with Boughs of Holly&quot;, have given rise to much speculation. Some believe that the traditional refrain &quot;Hob a derry down O&quot; encountered in some English folksongs is in fact an ancient Celtic phrase meaning &quot;dance around the oak tree.&quot; These suggestions remain controversial.

== In popular music ==
There are two distinct uses of the word &quot;chorus&quot;. In the thirty-two bar song form that was most common in the earlier twentieth-century popular music (especially the Tin Pan Alley tradition), &quot;chorus&quot; referred to the entire main section of the song (which was in a thirty-two bar AABA form). Beginning in the rock music of the 1950s, another form became more common in commercial pop music, which was based in an open-ended cycle of verses instead of a fixed 32-bar form. In this form (which is more common than thirty-two bar form in later-twentieth century pop music), &quot;choruses&quot; with fixed lyrics are alternated with &quot;verses&quot; in which the lyrics are different with each repetition. In this use of the word, chorus contrasts with the verse, which usually has a sense of leading up to the chorus. &quot;Many popular songs, particularly from early in this century, are in a verse and a chorus (&quot;refrain&quot;) form. Most popular songs from the middle of the century consist only of a chorus.&quot;

While the terms &#x27;refrain&#x27; and &#x27;chorus&#x27; often are used synonymously, it has been suggested to use &#x27;refrain&#x27; exclusively for a recurring line of identical text and melody which is part of a formal section—an A section in an AABA form (as in &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;: &quot;...who could ask for anything more?&quot;) or a verse (as in &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;: &quot;...the answer my friend is blowing in the wind&quot;)—whereas &#x27;chorus&#x27; shall refer to a discrete form part (as in &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;: &quot;We all live in a...&quot;). According to the musicologists Ralf von Appen and Markus Frei-Hauenschild

In German, the term, &quot;Refrain,&quot; is used synonymously with &quot;chorus&quot; when referring to a chorus within the verse/chorus form. At least one English-language author, Richard Middleton, uses the term in the same way.
In English usage, however, the term, »refrain« typically refers to what in German is more precisely called the »Refrainzeile« (refrain line): a lyric at the beginning or end of a section that is repeated in every iteration. In this usage, the refrain does not constitute a discrete, independent section within the form. 

== In jazz ==
Many Tin-Pan Alley songs using thirty-two bar form are central to the traditional jazz repertoire. In jazz arrangements the word &quot;chorus&quot; refers to the same unit of music as in the Tin Pan Alley tradition, but unlike the Tin Pan Alley tradition a single song can have more than one chorus. Von Appen and Frei-Hauenschild explain, &quot;The term, &#x27;chorus&#x27; can also refer to a single iteration of the entire 32 bars of the AABA form, especially among jazz musicians, who improvise over multiple repetitions of such choruses.&quot;

=== Arranger&#x27;s chorus ===
In jazz, an arranger&#x27;s chorus is where the arranger uses particularly elaborate techniques to exhibit their skill and to impress the listener. This may include use of counterpoint, reharmonization, tone color, or any other arranging device. The arranger&#x27;s chorus is generally not the first or the last chorus of a jazz performance.

=== Shout chorus ===
In jazz, a shout chorus (occasionally: out chorus) is usually the last chorus of a big band arrangement, and is characterized by being the most energetic, lively, and exciting and by containing the musical climax of the piece. A shout chorus characteristically employs extreme ranges, loud dynamics, and a re-arrangement of melodic motives into short, accented riffs. Shout choruses often feature tutti or concerted writing, but may also use contrapuntal writing or call and response between the brass and saxophones, or between the ensemble and the drummer. Additionally, brass players frequently use extended techniques such as falls, doits, turns, and shakes to add excitement.

<text>Feet of Clay is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the nineteenth book in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series, published in 1996. The story follows the members of the City Watch, as they attempt to solve murders apparently committed by a golem, as well as the unusual poisoning of the Patrician, Lord Vetinari.

The title is a figure of speech from Hebrew scripture (see feet of clay) and the script used in the book to represent Morporkian being written by a golem resembles the Hebrew alphabet, a reference to golems&#x27; origins in Jewish folklore.

==Plot==
Twelve of the city golems, clay creatures forced to obey the written instructions placed inside their heads, decide to create a &quot;king&quot; golem in order to free themselves. They fashion a golem from their own clay and place in his head instructions that would fulfill their hopes: &quot;Bring peace to the world&quot;, &quot;Treat everyone fairly&quot; and so on. They enroll the help of a priest and dwarf bread baker and museum curator to write the sacred instructions and bake the clay, respectively; Meshugah, the &quot;king&quot; golem, is initially sent to work in a candle factory.

Around the same time, a cabal of Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s nobles and guild leaders seeks to gradually depose the Patrician and replace him with a puppet ruler. After Commander Vimes learns that Nobby Nobbs may be the heir to the Earldom of Ankh whilst visiting the Royal College of Arms (where he was told that the Vimes coat of arms was declared extinct due to his ancestor Suffer-Not-Injustice &#x27;Stoneface&#x27; Vimes&#x27; regicidal acts), the cabal decide to declare Nobbs the new king since the Earls of Ankh were cousins of the last king, Lorenzo the Kind.

To implement this, the cabal orders the golems&#x27; newly made king, Meshugah, to make poisoned candles and have them delivered to the palace. Vetinari is successfully poisoned, making him severely ill. Meshugah, however, due to being improperly baked and &quot;overloaded&quot; by all the different instructions his creators gave him, goes &quot;mad&quot;: he starts overworking and, when he exhausts raw materials, he rampages through the city, and goes on to murder the priest and baker who took part in his creation. The golems that made him are horrified as murder violates their most base instructions and Meshugah was baked from some of their parts and is therefore “clay of their clay.”

At this point the City Watch steps in trying to solve the murders and the poisoning of Lord Vetinari. With the assistance of their new forensics expert dwarf Cheery Littlebottom (who gradually comes out as female over the course of the novel), Commander Vimes and Captain Carrot slowly unravel the mystery. The golems send one of their number, Dorfl, to falsely confess to the murders and the remaining eleven commit suicide. The cabal&#x27;s plan fails after Nobbs, already despondent that there is no wealth to his new title, flatly refuses their offer of becoming king, partly on the general principle of never volunteering (as it normally entails onerous duties), and partly out of fear that Vimes would &quot;go spare&quot; and execute him.

Carrot and Dorfl, having been given a receipt for himself and thus owning himself and having no master, fight and defeat the golem king at the candle factory. Despite having his instructions removed, Dorfl is able to reveal that “words in the heart can not be taken” before dying, and is rebaked with a voice. Afterwards, Vimes confronts the city&#x27;s chief heraldry expert, a vampire named Dragon King of Arms, who instigated the whole affair. Whilst Vimes suggests Carrot, the rightful heir to the Ankh-Morpork throne, was too virtuous for the cabal and that the signet ring which &#x27;proves&#x27; Nobbs&#x27; noble ancestry could have been stolen, Dragon suggests that it was to ensure that Carrot would not produce a part-werewolf line with Angua. Dorfl arrests him despite tenuous evidence and Vimes burns down the Royal College of Arms and all of its heraldic records as retribution against the &quot;elite&quot; and &quot;noble&quot; plotters, who had happily and self-righteously sacrificed the lives of several &quot;commoners&quot; in the pursuit of their scheme (namely an elderly woman and a baby from Cockbill Street, Vimes&#x27;s childhood neighbourhood, who died after using poisoned candle stubs taken from the palace).

In the end, Vetinari has recovered completely, Dorfl is sworn in as a Watchman (to the chagrin of Ankh-Morpork&#x27;s theological establishment), Vimes gets a pay raise, the Watch House gets a new dartboard, and Nobbs keeps secret his ownership of other heirlooms which could well prove his claim to the earldom. Vetinari reveals to his assistant, Drumknott, that he had already known of the plot for some time, having feigned his illness. Vimes&#x27; rash actions in the pursuit of truth had considerably scared the city elite, which is precisely why Vetinari had let him continue: so that the plotters would know just how much worse off they&#x27;d be if Vetinari died.

==Reception==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the book as &quot;fantasy served with a twist of Monty Python, parody that works by never taking itself too seriously&quot;, with &quot;sly puns&quot; and &quot;lively, outrageous characters&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, conversely, emphasized the book&#x27;s &quot;intelligent wit and wordplay with a notable lack of punnery&quot;, praised Pratchett for the &quot;complexity&quot; of the politics and the &quot;three-dimensional&quot; nature of the characters, and noted that the &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; plot &quot;doesn&#x27;t insult the reader&#x27;s intelligence&quot; despite involving &quot;the bumbling City Watch&quot; and &quot;a murderous enchanted statue&quot;.

At the &quot;SF Site&quot;, Steven H Silver commended Pratchett for presenting &quot;mysteries which can be solved with the clues provided&quot;, and stated that although the book does not have &quot;quite as many laugh out loud moments as [previous Discworld novels]&quot;, it shows that Pratchett is &quot;a novelist as well as a humorist&quot;.

Gideon Kibblewhite reviewed &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. Kibblewhite comments that &quot;It&#x27;s another gem from a master of comic fantasy.&quot;

<doc id="317735" wikidata="Q1294308" url="?curid=317735" title="Edwards Plateau">
<text>The Edwards Plateau is a geographic region forming the crossroads of Central, South and West Texas, United States. It is named in honor of Haden Edwards. It is bounded by the Balcones Fault to the south and east; the Llano Uplift and the Llano Estacado to the north; and the Pecos River and Chihuahuan Desert to the west. San Angelo, Austin, San Antonio and Del Rio roughly outline the area. The plateau, especially its southeast portion, is also known as the Texas Hill Country.

==Natural history==

The bedrock consists primarily of limestone, with elevations ranging between 100 and 3000 ft. Caves are numerous.

The landscape of the plateau is mostly savanna scattered with trees. It mostly lacks deep soil suitable for farming, though the soil type is fertile mollisol, so some cotton, grain sorghum, and oats are grown. For the most part, though, the thin soil and rough terrain areas are primarily grazing regions, with cattle, sheep, and goats (Angora and meat types) predominant. Several rivers cross the region, which generally flow to the south and east through the Texas Hill Country toward the Gulf of Mexico; springs occur (in wet years), but permanent surface water supplies are sparse throughout the area, except for man-made reservoirs. The area is well drained; rainwater flows into the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone at the south of the plateau to feed rivers to the south. Rainfall varies from 15 to 33 inches per year, typically, from northwest to southeast, and the area has a moderate temperature and a reasonably long growing season.

=== Flora ===
Trees of the savanna include Ashe junipers (locally called mountain cedar) and oak species, especially plateau live oak and Texas red oak, scattered over grasses such as little bluestem and sideoats grama, a vegetation type historically shaped by droughts and regular fires. Other abundant woody species include Texas mountain-laurel, Texas persimmon, cedar elm and agarito. Pecan trees are native in floodplains along springs and rivers, which are often lined with stands of baldcypress. The Balcones Fault zone which runs along the southern and eastern edge of the plateau is an ecological demarcation for the ranges of a number of species.

=== Fauna ===
Caves of the Edwards Plateau are important habitats for wildlife and for many endemic species. The area is home to some of the largest colonies of bats in the world, including millions of Mexican free-tailed bats. The largest colony of these inhabits Bracken Cave near San Antonio, while the Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin is the summer home for over half a million (they winter in Mexico) and is the largest bat colony anywhere in an urban area. The Edwards Plateau is home to at least 14 endemic freshwater fishes, including two subterranean species of catfish and 13 fish species considered to be spring-associated. Mechanisms for spring association of fishes is not fully understood, but thought to mediated by water temperature. The large numbers of reptiles and birds also include breeding populations of the Texan endemic golden-cheeked warbler (&quot;Setophaga&quot; &quot;chrysoparia&quot;).

Much of the natural habitat of the plateau has been converted to residential development, especially around Austin and San Antonio in the eastern part of the plateau. Further alteration to the savanna has incurred though the encroachment of shrubs now that grassland fires are carefully controlled. Small areas of intact habitat remain in protected areas such as the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge and Lost Maples State Natural Area. Another important area for wildlife is Fort Cavazos military base.

==Human history==

Earliest human settlement of this area was by Native Americans.
First it was used and wandered about by Jumano and Coahuiltecan groups, then the Apacheria extended into the Southern Plains by the forerunners of the Lipan and Mescalero Apaches. After the expulsion of the Apachean groups from the Plains by the Comanche, this area was dominated by the Penateka band of the Southern Comanche.

==Counties in the Edwards Plateau==
According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, all or portions of these 41 counties comprise the Edwards Plateau geographic region:
The Texas Water Development Board, a state government agency, includes additional counties all or partly in the Edwards Plateau area:
A map showing the counties is provided by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for the Edwards Plateau Ecoregion. The ecoregion is somewhat larger than the geographic region, as the map from Texas Parks And Wildlife includes additional counties that are listed by the Texas Water Development Board, notably the isolated area of Edwards Plateau in Taylor, Runnels, and Nolan Counties that is separated from the main region.

<doc id="317736" wikidata="Q986572" url="?curid=317736" title="Simancas">
<text>Simancas is a town and municipality of central Spain, located in the province of Valladolid, part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is situated approximately 10 km southwest of the provincial capital Valladolid, on the road to Zamora and the right bank of the river Pisuerga.

Simancas originated as the Roman &quot;Septimanca&quot;.

==Main sights==
Sights include a citadel dating from the Al-Andalus period in the 9th century, a bridge of seventeen arches, and many remains of old walls. In 939 it was the scene of a battle between the Christian troops under Ramiro II of León and the Moors of Abd-al-Rahman III.

The citadel is now the Archivo General de Simancas, sometimes called the Archivo General del Reino, to which the national archives of Spain were removed by order of Philip II in 1563. Their transference thither was first suggested to Charles V by Cardinal Ximenes de Cisneros. The extensive alterations were made by three 16th century architects, Juan de Herrera, Alonso Berruguete and Juan Gómez de Mora; the arrangement of the papers was entrusted to Diego de Ayala.

They occupy forty-six rooms, and are arranged in upwards of 80,000 bundles (33,000,000 documents), including important private as well as state papers. The archives of the Indies were transferred in 1784 to the Lonja of Seville. Permission to consult the documents at Simancas can be readily obtained.

==History==
On the outskirts of Simancas lies the megalithic tomb of Los Zumacales, a cromlech-type funerary monument of the Neolithic period. In the Roman era the city was known as Septimanca in the territory of the Vaccaei.

A medieval bridge sits over the Pisuerga river, constructed after the previous Roman one. Until the 12th century Simancas was, together with Cabezón, the most important town of Valladolid province. It was occupied by the army of Alfonso I in 753 and definitively conquered by Alfonso III in 883. 

The legend of the Tribute of the Seven Maidens holds that in the time of Abd al-Rahman II there existed a tribute named for the seven Simancan maidens who were handed over each year to Arab chieftains. However, on one occasion when the women were to be turned in, each one cut off one hand in an act of rebellion. The king Ramiro then uttered the phrase that would later give its name to the town: “Si mancas me las dais, mancas no las quiero” (“If maimed you give them to me, maimed I want them not”).

In the year 939 the Battle of Simancas was fought before the walls of the city between the Christian troops of Ramiro II and the Muslim caliph Abd al-Rahman III.

Around the middle of the 18th century the place was described as follows:

In 1812 there was a new Battle of Simancas between the Coalition troops (Spanish, English and Portuguese) commanded by the Duke of Wellington, against the army of Napoleon, which had retreated after the Battle of Salamanca.

====History of the “Tribute of the Seven Maidens”====
In the year 783, Mauregatus (the bastard son of Alfonso I of Asturias) took the Asturian throne with the help of Abd al-Rahman I, to whom he pledged the tribute payment of one hundred maidens for his assistance. In the year 788, the counts Don Arias and Don Oveco rebelled against Mauregatus and slew him as vengeance for enacting this tribute to the Moors. King Bermudo I, his successor, wished to cease the tribute, substituting for it a monetary payment. Bermudo was succeeded by Alfonso II the Chaste who, rejecting the tribute in gold as well, fought the Moors victoriously in the Battle of Lutos, killing the Moorish captain and ceasing the practice.

Later Abd al-Rahman II, during the reign of King Ramiro I, attempted to restart the tradition of the hundred maidens. Ramiro found himself in a weak position and agreed to pay the tribute once more. With the tribute in force again, there arose the legend that the people of Simancas sent in their required seven maidens; however, their hands had been cut off. It is said that the young women, in an act of great courage, decided to cut off one hand each to avoid their fate, and according to legend proceeded to do so. As a consequence the Christians then went to battle the Moors, which resulted in the Battle of Clavijo. The Moors were then defeated and the tribute of the hundred maidens ended, and the Christians established the Voto of Santiago in gratitude.

The patron festival of the Savior is celebrated on 6 August, which commemorates the history of the maidens of Simancas.

Each year in the middle of July, since the establishment of the tradition in 1994, forty-one people have reenacted the Oath of King Ramiro II de León. It commemorates the historical Battle of Simancas where the Christian troops destroyed the army of Abd al-Rahman III, and the subsequent pledge of the king to never again use the young women of Simancas as currency in the face of Moorish demands.

The Oath is the end of the legendary cycle for these brave maidens, seven young women who in the ceremony abandon the role they assumed a year before to make way, on August 6, for the women after them. Seven new girls will wear rainbow-colored medieval dresses for the &quot;Requerimiento&quot; (“Summoning”)-- the town mayor summons each girl at her home, in an act of tradition that brings the people out into the streets, thus enabling the cycle to begin anew. In this way Simancas revitalizes itself, year after year, in “a beautiful tradition whose base is in Astur-leonese legend, with a historical background, but which the town enriches in its own way,” said Teresa Salvador, the director of the Asociación El Zancón and organizer of the festival. 

While the “Summoning” of the seven young women has been celebrated since 1988, according to a project presented to the local government by Salvador, the Oath which marks the end of the story is only twelve years old.

====Danza de los Lazos====

In Simancas a traditional dance exists related to the Pascua de Resurrección, celebrated to its greatest extent at the beginning of the 20th century. Called the &quot;danza de los Lazos&quot; (“dance of the bows”), it features twelve young men from the area. They dress in a special outfit consisting of a white shirt, a woman’s underskirt, white shoes and stockings with a bow tied at the knee, a purple sash across the chest, and a striking, high-topped hat adorned with flowers. A character known as the &quot;Zárraga&quot; carrying a whip with a ball at the end accompanies the dancers. The dance starts in the town square where the &quot;Zárraga&quot; announces the following: “Se va a echar un lazo a la salud del señor alcalde” (“The mayor’s health is going to be tied up”). The participants then walk the streets, stopping in front of the houses of the richest and most generous citizens, dancing the &quot;lazo&quot; in front of them and subsequently receiving a prize of money.

<text>A raincoat is a waterproof or water-resistant garment worn on the upper body to shield the wearer from rain. The term rain jacket is sometimes used to refer to raincoats with long sleeves that are waist-length. A rain jacket may be combined with a pair of rain pants to make a rainsuit. Rain clothing may also be in one piece, like a boilersuit. Raincoats, like rain ponchos, offer the wearer hands-free protection from the rain and elements; unlike the umbrella.

Modern raincoats are often constructed from waterproof fabrics that are breathable, such as Gore-Tex or Tyvek and DWR-coated nylon. These fabrics and membranes allow water vapor to pass through, allowing the garment to &#x27;breathe&#x27; so that the sweat of the wearer can escape. The amount of pouring rain a raincoat can handle is sometimes measured in the unit millimeters, water gauge.

==Early history==

One of oldest examples of rainwear recorded is likely the woven grass cape/mat of Ötzi, around 3230 BCE.

The Olmec Native Americans first invented rubber sometime before 1600 BCE. They developed methods to extract natural latex resin from the rubber tree (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;), and cure the latex resin into stabilized rubber using the sulfuric compounds of the morning glory in order to create some of the world&#x27;s first waterproof textile fabrics using cotton and other plant fibers. These rubberized fabrics were crafted into waterproof cloaks, direct precursors to the modern raincoat, as well as other waterproof clothing like shoes.

The indigenous peoples of the Northwest Pacific Coast wore raincoats and other clothing made of woven cedar fiber which, depending on the tightness of the weave, could be dense and watertight, or soft and comfortable.

Throughout much of Eastern and Midwestern regions of North America, many Native American nations used treated leather from a variety of animals to create waterproof clothes, sometimes covered in fringe, to stay warm and dry. In addition to the decorative function, fringe would pull water off the main portion of their clothes so that the garment dried quicker.

The particularities of the Arctic climate gave rise to a distinctive culture of waterproof clothing. The Inuit, Aleuts, and many other peoples in the Arctic region have traditionally worn shirts, coats, and parkas made from the skins of seal, sea otter, fish, and birds. Birdskin shirts, with the feathers on the outside, provide excellent protection from rain as they repel moisture. In Aleut culture, a kamleika is worn as the outermost garment on top of the parka when necessary.
In East Asian cultures such as Vietnam, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan, the use of naturally water-repellent plant fibers, such as rice straw, to create waterproof raincoats and cloaks has been known since ancient times. This raincoat style often consisted of both an upper rainjacket and a lower apron. Materials varied, and were usually locally sourced. Each set took two to three days to craft and was typically paired with a matching straw hat. Raindrops that fell on such garments would run along the fibers and not penetrate into the interior, keeping the wearer dry. They were a common sight among farmers and fishermen on rainy and snowy days, as well as travelers during the rainy season. The raincoat being an absolutely indispensable asset, famed writer Xu Guangqi recorded a popular proverb during the Ming: &quot;No raincoat, no going out.&quot; When hunting or traveling at night, the coat could be used as a sleeping pad, and the smell of the leaves would drive away insects and snakes. When worn in wetlands or forests, these cloaks often blended in with the surrounding landscape, making the wearer more difficult to see. As garments made with pre-modern technology, they were extremely waterproof and breathable, but also bulky, and vulnerable to fire. While no longer used as raingear in modern times, traditional straw raincoats are still being made for special purposes such as religious events, tourist souvenirs, and interior decorations.

During the Zhou dynasty in China, the main materials for making raincoats and capes was rice straw, sedge, burlap, and coir. In southern China, hydrangeas were also used. Since at least 200 BCE, lightweight silk hanfu were rubbed with vegetable oils such as Tung oil to repel the rain. During the Ming dynasty, wealthy men and women could wear a “jade needle cape” made of Chinese silvergrass, considered soft and waterproof. 
During the Qing dynasty, emperors and officials wore raincoats made out of the pipal tree. Yellow garments were for the exclusive use of the emperor, red ones for princes and the highest court officials, and cyan ones for the second-ranking officials. Raincoats were made out of felt for winter use, with sateen and camlet for spring through autumn.

Rain capes made of straw have many indigenous names in modern Mexico, but they are most well known as &quot;capotes de plumas&quot; (also &quot;chereque&quot;, &quot;cherépara&quot;, or &quot;chiripe&quot;) as they are known in Michoacan and the &quot;capisallo&quot; from Tlaxcala, so named for the palm leaves&#x27; resemblance to bird feathers. In some regions, such as Colima, these rain capes are called &quot;china de palma trenzada&quot; because of their presumed Filipino origins. These capes can still be found today, in the most traditional indigenous corners of the country.

In New Zealand, the pākē or hieke are made from New Zealand Flax. In Polynesian Hawaii, Kui la’i or Ahu La`i are made from the leaves of the Ti plant, used not only to protect people from the rain, but also from the sun in hotter parts of the islands. Fishermen would wear them for protection from foul weather and ocean spray, similar in purpose to oilskins.

Furs were popular rainwear in Europe for much of its history, although the modest means of peasants and poor laborers limited the fur to cheaper varieties of goat or cat. Eventually, wool rainwear replaced fur as popular attitudes changed in the later Medieval period. Wool was known for its ability to keep the wearer warm even when soaked, especially wool that had been fulled during the manufacturing process. If wool was made without stringent cleaning, it would retain some of the sheep&#x27;s lanolin and be naturally somewhat water-resistant although not fully waterproof. Waxing of garments was known in England, but seldom done elsewhere due to the scarcity and expense of wax.

In the 15th and 16th century CE, Europeans arriving to the Americas recorded for themselves that the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica and the Amazon basin had created waterproof rubber-impregnated fabrics, although the Native American procedure of curing rubber was not well conveyed to them, and the tropical rubber tree did not grow well in the colder climates of Europe. As a result, rubber remained an impractical curiosity to Europeans until their redevelopment of the vulcanization process about 300 years later.

==Modern developments==
One of the first modern waterproof raincoats was created following the patent by Scottish chemist Charles Macintosh in 1824 of new tarpaulin fabric, described by him as &quot;India rubber cloth,&quot; and made by sandwiching a core of rubber softened by naphtha between two pieces of fabric.
The Mackintosh raincoat was made out of a fabric impregnated with impermeable rubber, although lacking the better curing methods of earlier Mesoamerican rainwear, the early coats suffered from odor, stiffness, and a tendency to deteriorate from natural body oils and hot weather. Many tailors were reluctant to use his new fabric, and had no interest in it. Charles set up his own company and eventually added vulcanized rubber to the coat in 1843, solving many of the problems.

In 1853, Aquascutum introduced a woolen fabric that was chemically treated to shed water. From then on into the early 20th century, the treated wool trench coat was popular fashion rainwear in Europe and the colder regions of the United States, especially among their military circles.
In the 1910s and 1920s, gas and vapor fabric rubberization techniques were patented at textile finishing mills such as the Jenckes Spinning Company, creating rubberized, waterproof fabrics that were softer, more pliable and more comfortable. Stiff raincoats made completely of rubber called &quot;slickers&quot; were also available, as well as raincoats made of heavy oilcloth. These raincoats and &quot;slickers&quot; mimicked the coat fashion of the time; long length, loose belt, high roll/convertible collar, large pockets, and were often sewn with a non-rubberized cotton or wool lining to improve comfort. Popular 1920s raincoat colors were tan, navy blue, and grey. Some of these coats were hooded, but often were not and instead accompanied by a matching rain hat.

In the 1930s, cellophane and PVC rainwear was preferred by many due to the poor economy during the Depression. They were economical, since only one covering had to be purchased instead of buying multiple fashion raincoats. They came in a variety of styles, including clear translucent.

In the 1940s and 1950s, DuPont Nylon emerged in the US as a durable synthetic material that was both lightweight and water-resistant; well-suited to rainwear. New coat styles using tightly woven cotton or rayon gabardine, and a treated shiny “paratroop” twill rayon for extra water resistance were also popular. Raincoats were offered in larger variety of colors like varying shades of blue, gray, bright greens, brown, or natural and could be purchased with taffeta and other synthetic blend linings. 
Between the 1950s and 1960s, PVC rainwear experienced a resurgence in popularity for the plastic&#x27;s bright and diverse colors and futuristic look. In the early 1960s, raincoats were introduced in high visibility colors for outdoor workwear and later were offered with retroreflective accents.
==Use as PPE==
Raincoats can also be used as a personal protective equipment, particularly in areas where PPEs are in short supply. However, the effectiveness depends on the style and materials used.

<doc id="317740" wikidata="Q769424" url="?curid=317740" title="Pictures at an Exhibition (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer album)">
<text>Pictures at an Exhibition is a live album by English progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, released in November 1971 on Island Records. It features the group&#x27;s rock adaptation of &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, the piano suite by Modest Mussorgsky, performed at Newcastle City Hall on 26 March 1971.

The band had performed the Mussorgsky piece since their live debut in August 1970, after keyboardist Keith Emerson had attended an orchestral performance of the piece several years before and pitched the idea to guitarist and frontman Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer, who agreed to adapt it while contributing sections to the arrangement. The album concludes with the concert&#x27;s encore, &quot;Nut Rocker&quot;, a rock adaptation of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; originally arranged by Kim Fowley and recorded by B. Bumble and the Stingers in 1962.

&quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; went to number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2001, it was reissued as a remastered edition that included a studio version of the piece recorded in 1993.

==Background==
In February 1971, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer finished recording their second studio album &quot;Tarkus&quot;. They resumed touring in the following month, which began with a UK leg that included a show at Newcastle City Hall, Newcastle on 26 March. The tour&#x27;s setlist included their rock arrangement of the classical suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; by Modest Mussorgsky, which had been performed since their live debut in August 1970. Keyboardist Keith Emerson had attended an orchestral performance of the suite several years before, and bought a copy of the score. He pitched the idea of performing the suite to singer/bassist/guitarist Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer, who agreed to adapt it. Both members contributed their own arrangements and additions to the suite.

The band had already recorded and filmed a live performance of the Mussorgsky suite at the Lyceum Theatre in London, on 9 December 1970, and planned a live album release around August 1971. However, their dissatisfaction with the picture, editing, and audio led to the decision to record another show. Palmer deemed the film &quot;shocking&quot; which lacked any contemporary filming technique, and said the absence of engineer Eddy Offord to control the sound contributed to its substandard quality. The date at Newcastle City Hall was chosen for the new recording, and Palmer recalled the &quot;amazing atmosphere&quot; of the concert. Emerson said the venue was chosen as the band were popular there, and hoped to use its pipe organ. He was granted permission, but had to promise the Musician&#x27;s Union he would not stick knives on the console, which he had done since he was in The Nice. The band paid for the recording costs themselves, with the aim of producing the best quality version. They arrived at Newcastle at 10am and underwent rehearsals and checks for several hours. The Lyceum concert film had a limited theatrical release, which Palmer said was only due to the fact that a group friend was in charge and let them release it.

The album was recorded using the mobile recording unit from Pye Records. The opening section, &quot;Promenade&quot;, features Emerson playing a Harrison &amp; Harrison pipe organ which was installed at the venue in 1928. The organ console is some way above stage level, at the top of a stepped terrace typically used for choral performances. Palmer&#x27;s drum roll connecting &quot;Promenade&quot; to the following section was added to give Emerson time to return to his keyboards.

==Arrangement==
The band&#x27;s arrangement of the suite uses only four of the ten parts in Mussorgsky&#x27;s suite, along with the linking &quot;Promenade&quot; sections. The suite was performed live as one continuous piece, with new, group-written sections linking Mussorgsky&#x27;s original themes.

Note that Mussorgsky&#x27;s original compositions are listed in bold:

# Promenade: Pipe organ solo by Emerson at the Harrison &amp; Harrison pipe organ of the auditorium; followed by a drum roll
# The Gnome: Group instrumental adaptation featuring fuzz bass, Hammond and Moog
# Promenade: Hammond organ and soft vocal, followed by a short synthesizer solo
# The Sage: A new picture drawn by Lake solely on acoustic guitar in the mood of a medieval minnesang, it works as sort of romantic prelude to &quot;The Old Castle&quot; 
# The Old Castle: Begins with Emerson squeezing out whoops and whistles from the Moog&#x27;s ribbon controller, followed by an accelerated adaptation of the original theme played by the full band
# Blues Variation: a Hammond-driven twelve-bar blues credited to the group, borrowing themes from &quot;The Old Castle&quot; and those that Emerson had previously performed with The Nice on their version of &quot;My Back Pages&quot;
# Promenade: Full group instrumental version of the primary theme
# The Hut of Baba Yaga: Full group instrumental adaptation
# The Curse of Baba Yaga: Lake adapts a section of Mussorgsky&#x27;s music on fuzz/wah-wah bass, followed by a group-penned section with lyrics/vocal climaxing on a siren-like Moog solo 
# The Hut of Baba Yaga: Full group reprise of the earlier &quot;Hut&quot; theme 
# The Great Gates of Kiev: with lyrics/vocal added by the group and an extended climax featuring Emerson dragging his Hammond organ across the stage to produce feedback

==Cover==
The cover was designed and painted by William Neal, who produced every canvas. Palmer bought one of them after he had completed it. The album was packaged in a gatefold sleeve, the outside of which depicts blank picture frames labelled with the titles of the pictures: &quot;The Old Castle&quot;, &quot;The Gnome&quot;, etc. The paintings were large oil paintings containing various images related to the band, like the &quot;Tarkus&quot; background in &quot;The Hut&quot; and the white dove embossed into the titanium white oil paint in &quot;Promenade&quot; (visible only on the original painting), resembling the cover of the band&#x27;s debut album. On the inner gatefold all of the paintings were revealed, but &quot;Promenade&quot; remains blank; this section of the suite is not about a picture, but represents a walk through the exhibition. Some later pressings on CD use only the &quot;revealed&quot; version.

Neal&#x27;s paintings were later hung at Hammersmith Town Hall, and photographed by Keith Morris and Nigel Marlow, both former graduates from Guildford School of Art.

==Release and reception==

After the album was recorded Lake was wary that its classical content would make the public compare Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer to The Nice, and argued against its release before &quot;Tarkus&quot;. As a compromise &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; was to be released at a budget price, but upon learning this Atlantic Records vetoed the idea. The label could not decide whether to promote it as a rock or classical record and at one point, considered putting it out on an associated label, Nonesuch Records, that handled classical releases. Fearing that this would lead to poor sales, the band decided to shelve the work. Palmer said the group received letters from fans expressing their anger at the delay. After the album was broadcast in its entirety on WNEW-FM in New York City, the public&#x27;s demand for the album convinced Atlantic to release it at full price. The band had hoped to release it in the UK for 99p, but it was released at £1.49. Originally, the group had thought of releasing &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; as a double album, with the suite on disc one and the material they had recorded for &quot;Trilogy&quot; (1972) on disc two, but they thought the public had waited long enough for &quot;Pictures&quot; to be released and wanted to put it out sooner.

The album was released in November 1971 and reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart. Budget-priced albums were eligible for inclusion at the time of release, but a change in chart regulations in early 1972 excluded them, which meant that the album disappeared from the chart after just five weeks. In the US, the album peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

Critical reception to the album was generally favorable in the UK (where ELP won the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; poll for best group that year) but quite harsh in America, where a new contingent of rock critics was beginning to rail against the excesses of progressive rock. Robert Christgau gave the album a D+ and Lester Bangs, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, brutally mocked the attempt at recording a classical suite. The album was a great success with fans, however, and a shortened version of &quot;Pictures&quot; continued to be used as a live encore through the remainder of the band&#x27;s career. The album continues to evoke a highly divided reaction among critics, with some hailing it as a peak of the progressive rock genre while others continue to bewail it as its nadir. 

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

===Reissues===
The album was reissued in 2001 with a new master and a bonus studio version of the suite recorded in 1993 that was released &quot;The Return of the Manticore&quot; (1993) box set and some pressings of &quot;In the Hot Seat&quot; (1994). A new remaster was issued in a 2005 Deluxe Edition included the live performance of the suite from the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. The album was remastered once more in 2016, containing live bonus tracks from the 1972 Mar y Sol Festival (actually only the track &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition (Medley)&quot;) and the December 9, 1970 Lyceum Theatre concert (almost the complete show).

==History==
The first settlers in what would become Beckried were from Alamanni tribes that moved into the area over 2000 years ago. During the Middle Ages the region was part of extensive estates that were shared between Engelberg Abbey, Murbach-Lucerne and Steinen, Switzerland. The two tower houses in the village (named: &quot;Retschrieden&quot; and &quot;Isenringen&quot;) were built in the 13th century for two local, influential families.

<doc id="317744" wikidata="Q320704" url="?curid=317744" title="Benin City">
<text>Benin City serves as the capital and largest 
metropolitan centre of Edo State, situated in southern Nigeria. It ranks as the fourth-most populous city in Nigeria, according to the 2006 national census, preceded by Lagos, Kano, and Ibadan.

== Geography ==
Benin City is located in close proximity to the Benin River, situated approximately to the north, whilst its eastern perimeter lies from Lagos via the arterial road network. The city&#x27;s municipal boundaries converge with those of several prominent neighbouring towns in southern Nigeria, notably Agbor, Oghara, and Ekpoma.

== Agriculture ==
Benin City boasts an exceptionally fertile agricultural landscape and serves as the epicentre of Nigeria&#x27;s thriving rubber industry. Additionally, the production of palm oil constitutes a substantial sector, further underscoring the city&#x27;s prominence in Nigeria&#x27;s agricultural economy.

== Trade ==
The city of Benin served as the paramount settlement of the Edo Kingdom of Benin, a pre-colonial polity that flourished from the 13th to the 19th centuries. During its final centuries, the kingdom maintained significant trade relations with Portugal, prior to being captured, sacked, and razed in 1897 by a British punitive expedition. This expedition resulted in the looting of numerous bronze sculptures from the Benin City palace, collectively referred to as the Benin Bronzes. Subsequent to their punitive victory, the British gradually colonized the area, eventually incorporating the region into Colonial Nigeria.

The indigenous inhabitants of Benin City are the Edo people, also referred to as the Benin people, who communicate in the Edo language, also known as the Bini language. The city&#x27;s populace boasts one of the richest dress cultures on the African continent, renowned for their elaborate adornments, including beads symbolizing royalty, body marks, bangles, anklets, and intricate raffia work. Additionally, the people of Benin City engage in subsistence farming, primarily cultivating yams, plantains, and cassava.

==History==

=== Edo people ===
Origins of the Ẹdo Empire

According to tradition, the original inhabitants and founders of the Ẹdo Empire and the Edo people were ruled by the kings known as the Ogiso dynasty, who referred to the land as Igodomigodo. The first Ogiso, Igodo, wielded significant influence and gained popularity as a benevolent ruler. He died after a protracted reign and was succeeded by Ere, his eldest son.

Succession crisis and the rise of Oduduwa

A battle for power soon erupted between the wife of the last Ogiso and Prince Ekaladerhan, son of the last Ogiso. Prince Ekaladerhan was falsely accused by his father&#x27;s wife and sentenced to death. However, the men sent to execute him released him at Ughoton. The exiled prince made his way to Ile-Ife, where he changed his name to Izoduwa, meaning &quot;I have found prosperity&quot;.

Search for Prince Ekaladerhan and the founding of the Oba Dynasty

During this period of confusion in Benin, the elders, led by Chief Oliha, mounted a search for the banished Prince Ekaladerhan – whom the Ife people now called Oduduwa. The exiled Ekaladerhan, now Oduduwa, refused to return to Benin due to the circumstances of his departure. Instead, he sent his son, Ọranmiyan, to become king in his place.

Prince Ọranmiyan took up residence in the palace built for him at Uzama by the elders, now a coronation shrine. Soon after, he married a beautiful lady, Ẹrinmwide, daughter of Osa-nego, the ninth &quot;Enogie&quot; of Egor. He and Erinmwide had a son. After some years, he called a meeting of the people and renounced his office, remarking that the country was a land of vexation, &quot;Ile-Ibinu&quot;, and that only a child born, trained, and educated in the arts and mysteries of the land could reign over the people.

The legacy of Oduduwa and the Oba Dynasty

The country was afterward known by this name. He caused his son, born to him by Ẹrinmwide, to be made King in his place and returned to Ife land. After some years in Ife, he left for Benin. Ọranmiyan himself was reigning as Ọọni of Ifẹ. Therefore, Ọranmiyan of Ife, is the father of Eweka I, the first Oba of Benin, and father of Ajaka, Alaafin of Ọyọ. 

Around 1470, Ẹwuare changed the name of the state to Ẹdo. This was about the time the people of Ọkpẹkpẹ migrated from Benin City. Alternatively, the Yoruba nation has a different conception of Oduduwa. According to Yoruba tradition, because of his power and military might, he was able to defeat the enemies invading Benin and that is why the people of Benin made him the King or Ọba of Benin. In any case, it is agreed upon by both the Yoruba and the Edo that Oduduwa sent his son Prince Oranmiyan of Ife to rule Benin City and founded the Oba dynasty in Benin City. Benin imperialism was started in the last decade of the 13th century by Oba Ewedo. Oba Ewedo later changed the name of the city of Ile-Binu, the capital of the Benin kingdom, to &quot;Ubini.&quot; This name would be reinterpreted by the Portuguese as &quot;Benin&quot; in their own language.

=== European contact and colonization ===
The Portuguese encounter and the rise of Benin

In approximately 1485, Portuguese explorers visited Benin City, marking the beginning of European contact with the kingdom. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin flourished economically due to its strategic position in the transatlantic trade network, exchanging goods such as pepper and ivory with European nations.

Diplomatic relations with Portugal

In the early 16th century, the Ọba of Benin sent an ambassador to Lisbon, while the King of Portugal reciprocated by dispatching Christian missionaries to Benin. This exchange facilitated the introduction of European culture, technology, and ideas to the kingdom. Interestingly, some residents of Benin City could still converse in a pidgin Portuguese dialect in the late 19th century, and many Portuguese loan words continue to be used in the local languages.

A Portuguese captain&#x27;s Account of Benin City

In 1691, a Portuguese captain provided a vivid description of Benin City, highlighting its impressive architecture, wealth, and governance:

&quot;Great Benin, where the king resides, is larger than Lisbon; all the streets run straight and as far as the eye can see. The houses are large, especially that of the king, which is richly decorated and has fine columns. The city is wealthy and industrious. It is so well governed that theft is unknown and the people live in such security that they have no doors to their houses.&quot;

The British conquest and its aftermath

On 17 February 1897, Benin City fell to the British during the &quot;Punitive Expedition&quot;, a military campaign led by Admiral Sir Harry Rawson. The British force captured, sacked, and burnt the city, following the ambush and killing of a British delegation led by Acting Consul General James Robert Phillips.
Alan Boisragon, one of the survivors of the Benin Massacre, included references to the practice of human sacrifice in the city in a firsthand account written in 1898 (one year after the Punitive Expedition). Historian James D. Graham notes that although &quot;there is little doubt that human sacrifices were an integral part of the Benin state religion from very early days,&quot; first-hand accounts regarding such acts often varied significantly, with some reporting them and others making no mention of them. The expedition resulted in the looting of the Benin Bronzes, a collection of intricate brass plaques and sculptures that adorned the palace walls.

The Benin Bronzes and the legacy of colonialism
The Benin Bronzes were subsequently auctioned off to compensate for the expenses incurred during the capture and occupation of the city. Today, these artifacts are scattered throughout Western museums, with many calling for their repatriation to Nigeria. The most iconic of these artifacts is the Queen Idia mask, which was used as a mascot during the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC &#x27;77) held in Nigeria in 1977.

The British colonization of Benin paved the way for the merging of regional British incorporations of African kingdoms into the Niger Coast Protectorate, the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, and finally, into the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Although the British permitted the restoration of the Benin monarchy in 1914, true political power remained with the colonial administration of Nigeria.

=== Nigerian independence ===
Post-Colonial Era and Administrative Reforms

Following Nigeria&#x27;s attainment of independence from British colonial rule in 1960, Benin City emerged as the capital of the Mid-Western Region, subsequent to the region&#x27;s separation from the Western Region in June 1963. This administrative reconfiguration aimed to promote regional autonomy and more effective governance.

Renaming and Restructuring of Administrative Regions

In 1976, the Mid-Western Region underwent a nomenclatural transformation, being renamed Bendel State, Benin City retained its status as the regional capital, serving as the administrative epicentre of the state. This designation persisted until 1991, when Bendel State was bifurcated into two distinct entities: Delta State and Edo State. Consequently, Benin City became the state capital of Edo State, assuming a pivotal role in the governance and development of the newly formed state.

=== Climate change ===

Scientists have already demonstrated the effects of climate change, with increases in temperature, humidity and precipitation trends between 1981 and 2015.

==== Flood management ====
Benin city experiences regular flooding. Studies have consistently highlighted the problem since at least 1993. Experts have recommended a number of ways to improve flood management, including better controls on land use, construction and development, improved Community-based programs designed to improve city adaptation and disaster management, and improvements in individual preparedness.

In June 2020, a significant number of communities and individuals were left homeless because of city flooding. At the time, residents and the city blamed poor storm drains and a failure to continue flood adaptation programs.

==== Urban heating ====
The city is on average warmer than the surrounding rural areas, and these temperature differences are greater during the working weeks.

==== Waste management ====
A 2021 study published in &quot;Nature&quot;, highlighted that the city has not met the standards for waste management set by the Edo State Waste Management Board. After surveying 2,720 inhabitants of the city, the authors found that most people in the city did not understand proper waste management practices. Moreover, the study found that survey participants did not understand how waste management was connected to other issues like greenhouse gas emissions. An additional study found that most residents did not understand the health impacts of bad waste management.

<text>Francisco Morazán (, abbreviated FMO) is one of the departments of Honduras.

It is located in the central part of the nation. The departmental capital is Tegucigalpa, which is also Honduras&#x27;s national capital.

The department is very mountainous, with rugged ranges covered in pine forests; which are rocky and mostly clay. Valleys, like those of Guaimaca, Talanga, and Amarateca, are interspersed among the ranges. Many of the high mountain peaks house cloud forests, like La Tigra National park or Cerro Uyuca. The extreme southeastern portion of the department has a Pacific dry forest environment, while the northern portion contains the &quot;Montaña de la Flor&quot;, home to the Jicaque people.

Francisco Morazán department covers a total surface area of and, in 2005, had an estimated population of 1,680,700 people.

The coat-of-arms and departmental flag of Francisco Morazán Department are the same as its capital, Tegucigalpa.

== History ==

=== Precolumbian Times ===
In pre-Columbian times the department was inhabited mainly by Lenca Indians in the center and south and Tolupan in the north. Archaeological sites demonstrate that they were inhabited by an organized society since approximately the pre-Classic Mesoamerican period. Las Terrazas Ruins as well as the Ayasta caves are examples of organized human presence before European colonization. 

=== Colonial era and independence ===
The territory began to be colonized by the Spanish in the 16th century and the towns of San Miguel de Tegucigalpa, Santa Lucia, and Ojojona were founded as mining hubs. Over time, the territory of what is now Francisco Morazán was part of the Province of Tegucigalpa. The name of the department honors Francisco Morazán, one of the most important heroes in the history of Central America, who was a political and military leader during the time of the Central American Federation in the 19th century

=== 20th century ===
Until April 16th of 1943 it was known as Tegucigalpa department. It was renamed after national hero Francisco Morazán.
