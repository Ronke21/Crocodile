<text>John Franklin Broyles (December 26, 1924 – August 14, 2017) was an American college football player and coach, college athletics administrator, and broadcaster. He served as the head football coach for one season at the University of Missouri in 1957 and at the University of Arkansas from 1958 to 1976, compiling a career coaching record of 149–62–6. Broyles was also the athletic director at Arkansas from 1974 to 2007. His mark of 144–58–5 in 19 seasons at the helm of the Arkansas Razorbacks football gives him the most wins and the most coached games of any head coach in program history. With Arkansas, Broyles won seven Southwest Conference titles and his 1964 team was named a national champion by a number of selectors including the Football Writers Association of America.

Broyles attended Georgia Tech, where he was the starting quarterback for the Yellow Jackets and also lettered in baseball and basketball. Following his playing career, he was an assistant football coach at Baylor University, the University of Florida, and his alma mater, Georgia Tech. Broyles was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1983.

==Playing career==
After his graduation from Decatur Boys High School, Broyles studied at Georgia Tech, where he was a quarterback from 1944 to 1946. He graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in Industrial Management. Broyles started all of Tech&#x27;s games as quarterback during his senior season, and led the Yellow Jackets to the 1945 Orange Bowl. Tech lost the bowl game, but in defeat Broyles set an Orange Bowl record for passing yards with 304. The record stood for 55 years until eclipsed by Michigan quarterback Tom Brady in the 2000 Orange Bowl. Broyles is a member of the Orange Bowl (1991), Gator Bowl (1995), and Cotton Bowl Classic (1999) halls of fame, and the Georgia Tech Hall of Fame. Broyles was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the third round of the 1946 NFL draft when he still had a year of college eligibility. When his college career was over he moved straight into coaching.

While at Georgia Tech he also played basketball.

==Coaching career==

Broyles entered coaching in 1947 as the backfield coach under head coach Bob Woodruff at Baylor University. In 1950, Broyles followed Woodruff when the latter took the head coach position at the University of Florida. In 1951, he left Florida and returned to Georgia Tech as the backfield coach under coach Bobby Dodd. Broyles sought the head coaching position at Northwestern University in 1954, and ultimately left Georgia Tech in 1957 when he was offered the position of head coach at the University of Missouri. Broyles stayed at Missouri only one season when he was offered the head coaching job at Arkansas. During his nineteen years as head coach there, he was offered other major coaching and leadership positions, but remained at Arkansas.

During his tenure at Arkansas, Broyles coached the Razorbacks to seven Southwest Conference championships, and two Cotton Bowl Classic wins. His 1964 team was proclaimed national champions by the Football Writers Association of America, as well as the Helms Foundation, and to date is the last Razorback team to go undefeated and untied in a season. If the wire service polls had not given out their national championships prior to the bowl games during that era of college football, Arkansas positively would have won both the AP and the UPI national titles as well, since Alabama (winner of both) lost to Texas (a team Arkansas beat in Austin in 1964) in the Orange Bowl. He still holds the record for most wins by a head coach in the history of Arkansas football, with 144. During the 1960s and 1970s, one of college football&#x27;s most intense rivalries was between Broyles&#x27; Razorbacks and the University of Texas Longhorns under legendary coach Darrell Royal.

Among Broyles&#x27; most memorable victories while coaching the Razorbacks was the 14–13 win over No. 1 Texas in 1964 in Austin, the 1965 Cotton Bowl victory over Nebraska to complete an undefeated season, the 1969 Sugar Bowl victory over Georgia, beating No. 2 Texas A&amp;M in the 1975 season finale to win a share of the SWC championship, and then beating Georgia in the 1976 Cotton Bowl.

The two most painful losses in his tenure at Arkansas, included the 1966 Cotton Bowl loss to LSU that snapped Arkansas&#x27; 22 game winning streak, and, most famously, the 1969 Game of the Century that saw No. 1 Texas come from behind to beat No. 2 Arkansas, 15–14.

==Broadcasting career==
After his retirement from coaching, but concurrent with the early part of his tenure as men&#x27;s athletic director at Arkansas, Broyles served as the primary color commentator for ABC Sports television coverage of college football, normally alongside top play-by-play man Keith Jackson. Broyles&#x27; time as a broadcaster at ABC lasted from 1977 to 1985. Broyles was often assigned games involving Southeastern Conference or Southwest Conference teams, but if the primary game of a particular week involved the Razorbacks, Broyles was paired with another play-by-play man, many times Al Michaels or Chris Schenkel, while Jackson called the game with another color commentator, many times Ara Parseghian. Broyles&#x27; commentary was normally focused on play calling and coaching strategy, and while paired with Jackson, resulted in an all-Georgian booth (Jackson was a native of Roopville).

As a member of Augusta National Golf Club, Broyles from 1972 to 1977 co-hosted (with tournament chairmen Clifford Roberts and William Lane) the green jacket presentation ceremony at the end of the Masters Tournament from Butler Cabin televised on CBS.

==Athletic director==
In 1974 Broyles was appointed Men&#x27;s Athletic Director of the University of Arkansas. (Arkansas had a completely separate women&#x27;s athletics department from 1971 until the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programs were merged in 2008.) Broyles continued as head football coach for three years. Since stepping down as head coach, the University of Arkansas men&#x27;s athletic programs under his leadership as athletic director won 43 national championships. The Razorbacks won 57 Southwest Conference championships and 47 Southeastern Conference championships during his tenure. Broyles disbanded the men&#x27;s swimming and diving program to satisfy new regulations from the SEC of having two more women&#x27;s sports than men&#x27;s sports.

On February 17, 2007, Broyles announced his plans to retire as Men&#x27;s Athletic Director, effective December 31, 2007, ending his half-century association with Arkansas.

==Criticism==

As athletic director, Broyles was known for being very hands-on with the football program. Indeed, at least one head coach, Ken Hatfield, left the school because he couldn&#x27;t abide Broyles&#x27; meddling. After Hatfield left, at least one booster doubted whether the Razorbacks would ever attract a top-tier head coach as long as Broyles was athletic director.

In 2000, following an expansion of Razorback Stadium, Broyles announced that one home game would move from War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock to Fayetteville, and that, in the near future, all home games might be played on campus. In the end, a long-term agreement was reached to keep 2–3 games in Little Rock, while the rest would be played in Fayetteville.
As of the Fall 2022 season, all home games (7 for 2022) will be played in Fayetteville.

==Legacy==

Over thirty of his former players have also become college or professional football coaches. Broyles is known for producing high quality coaches and the prestigious &quot;Broyles Award&quot;, the annual award for best assistant coach, is named after him. Barry Switzer, Johnny Majors, Joe Gibbs, Hayden Fry, and Jimmy Johnson all served under Broyles and have combined to win five collegiate national championships and six Super Bowls. Broyles&#x27; assistants have won more than 40 conference titles. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones played on Broyles&#x27; 1964 Championship team.

Broyles&#x27; tenure as men&#x27;s athletic director has seen the construction of world-class facilities for basketball, football, track and field (indoor and outdoor), golf, and baseball at Arkansas. Broyles was selected as the 20th century&#x27;s most influential Arkansas sports figure. Broyles will be remembered as the only SEC athletic director that had to drop a men&#x27;s sport, bringing into questions the health of the athletic department under his leadership.

Broyles was known as a fierce competitor both as a head coach and athletic director. Broyles led Arkansas out of the Southwest Conference and into the Southeastern Conference.

In 1983 Broyles was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, and in 1996, the Broyles Award was established to recognize the top assistant coaches in college football. He was a member of the Augusta National Golf Club.

In 2005, after his wife Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Broyles became an outspoken advocate for Alzheimer&#x27;s awareness and established the Frank and Barbara Broyles Foundation to support caregivers of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients. With the assistance of the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, he published and distributed 100,000 free copies of a book titled &quot;Coach Broyles&#x27; Playbook for Alzheimer&#x27;s Caregivers&quot; to pharmacies throughout the state of Arkansas. In 2007 and again in 2009, Broyles successfully raised funds to distribute 500,000 copies of the book nationally, plus 100,000 copies in Spanish. Since then, the book has been translated into 11 different languages and distributed digitally worldwide. Broyles himself would eventually succumb to complications of the same disease on August 14, 2017.

<doc id="310454" wikidata="Q2532967" url="?curid=310454" title="Sweetnighter">
<text>Sweetnighter is the third studio album by American jazz fusion band Weather Report, released by Columbia Records in 1973.

== Writing and recording ==
The group had recorded the songs in a five-day stretch during February of the same year. It was to be the last album to feature founding member Miroslav Vitouš as the primary bassist.

Zawinul began to assert greater control of the band, steering it away from the collective improvisation that marked its live performances toward more structured compositions emphasizing funk and groove. This was exemplified by the album&#x27;s two dominant tracks, &quot;Boogie Woogie Waltz&quot; and &quot;125th Street Congress,&quot; as well as the closer, &quot;Non-Stop Home.&quot; Other tracks were reminiscent of Weather Report&#x27;s previous albums. Sweetnighter is considered to be the most stylistically transitional release by the band as it bridged the gap between the more open, improvisational earlier style to a more compositionally structured format. Also, the more prominent use of electric bass is evident here. Zawinul had taken the decision to add some funky beats in the band&#x27;s sounds, so he recruited drummer Herschel Dwellingham and percussionist Muruga Booker to play on the album. Andrew White was hired to play the English horn, but also handled the bass for three tracks here.

&quot;Sweetnighter&quot; was recorded at a Connecticut recording studio in less than a week, and was released in April 1973.

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Ask yourself: What kind of a jazz (or rock) (or jazz-rock) group would conceive its sonar identity around electric keyboards and soprano sax? A pretty dinky (not dunky) one, right? So while I&#x27;m pleased that they&#x27;re going for a drum groove a little solider than anything Dom Um Romao can move and shake, I&#x27;m not surprised that they get it only—just barely, in fact—on &#x27;125th Street congress.&#x27; And that &#x27;Boogie Woogie Waltz&#x27; is fatally cute, ace improvisations and all.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Boogie Woogie Waltz&quot; was frequently in the band&#x27;s live sets through the 1970s, and a live version from 1978 appeared on the album &quot;8:30.&quot; Also in 1978, Vitouš recorded a new version of &quot;Will&quot; with Terje Rypdal and Jack DeJohnette on their collective album for ECM.

<text>Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is a public research university in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The university is based on two sites; the City Campus is located in the city centre near Sheffield railway station, while the Collegiate Crescent Campus is about two miles away in the Broomhall Estate off Ecclesall Road in south-west Sheffield. A third campus at Brent Cross Town in the London Borough of Barnet is expected to open for the 2025–26 academic year.

The university is the largest university in the UK (out of ) with students (of whom 4,400 are international students), 4,494 staff and 708 courses.

==History==
===Foundation and growth===
In 1843, as the industrial revolution gathered pace and Sheffield was on the verge of becoming the steel, tool and cutlery making capital of the world, the Sheffield School of Design was founded following lobbying by artist Benjamin Haydon. The day-to-day running was controlled by the local council, whilst the Board of Trade in London appointed the head. Tuition began in a 60x40ft rented room off Glossop Road. In 1850, the School of Design was renamed Sheffield School of Art.

In 1905, the City of Sheffield Training College (later renamed Sheffield City College of Education) on Collegiate Crescent admitted its first 90 students. During the First World War, the Collegiate Hall was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 3rd Northern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties.

A new city centre campus was constructed during the 1960s. During construction, in February 1962, a tower crane on site collapsed during the Great Sheffield Gale. It crashed into the side of what would become the Owen Building, causing serious damage and setting back construction. In 1967, the Owen Building was completed. Built in a functional 1960s design, it has since been modernised and comprehensively renovated with an atrium linking it to four adjacent buildings. In 1969 the Sheffield School of Design merged with the city&#x27;s College of Technology to form Sheffield Polytechnic. In 1976, Sheffield Polytechnic merged with the city&#x27;s two teacher training colleges (Sheffield City College and Totley Hall College) and was renamed Sheffield City Polytechnic.
From 1979 to 1988 students from Sheffield City Polytechnic were based at Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham. Two departments, Physical Education and Geography and Environmental Studies, were based on site. In 1987 Sheffield City Polytechnic became a founding member of the Northern Consortium.

===University status to present day===
In 1992, Sheffield City Polytechnic became Sheffield Hallam University (SHU), with the right to award its own degrees.

In 2005, SHU was reorganised into four faculties. The new Faculty of Development and Society, with an emphasis on &#x27;people, places and spaces&#x27;, brought together education, geography, humanities, law, and social sciences. At the same time, with the intention of further developing research and teaching in the new Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, a new Clinical Academic Group was launched. The building that had been designed and constructed to house the National Centre for Popular Music became the university&#x27;s students&#x27; union building (the HUBS). The Nelson Mandela Building, the former students&#x27; union building (when opened in 1978 was known as the Phoenix building), was sold and has since been demolished.

In 2007, SHU took over the teaching of nursing and midwifery from the University of Sheffield. These activities are now based at the Collegiate Crescent Campus. The following year the Psalter Lane campus (formerly the Sheffield College of Art) was closed, and the activities transferred to the City Campus. The £26 million energy-efficient Furnival Building opened in September (renamed Cantor Building in 2011 in recognition of a major donor to the university). The building, which includes teaching spaces and an art gallery has been described as &quot;the impressive new entry point to the campus&quot;. For the 2025–26 academic year, the University expects to open its London campus at the Brent Cross Town development in the London Borough of Barnet. The campus will accommodate up to 5,000 students by 2030.

<doc id="310460" wikidata="Q16154326" url="?curid=310460" title="Arti (Hinduism)">
<text>Arti () or Aarati () is a Hindu ritual employed in worship, part of a &quot;puja&quot;, in which light from a flame (fuelled by camphor, ghee, or oil) is ritually waved to venerate deities. &quot;Arti&quot; also refers to the hymns sung in praise of the deity, when the light is being offered. Sikhs have &quot;Arti&quot; &quot;kirtan&quot; which involves only devotional singing; the Nihang order of Sikhs also use light for &quot;arti&quot;.

&quot;Aarti&quot; is thought to have descended from &quot;Vedic&quot; &quot;fire rituals or yajna&quot;. &quot;Aarati&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word () which means something that removes , “darkness”. A Marathi language reference says it is also known as (). According to Steven Rosen, &quot;arti&quot; means &quot;before night&quot; or symbolic end of the night to the worshipper&#x27;s &quot;material sojourn - he or she is now situated in the light of God&#x27;s devotion.&quot;

==Practice==
&quot;Aarti&quot; ranges from simple acts of worship to extravagant rituals, but almost always includes a &quot;jyoti&quot; (flame or light). It is performed up to eight times daily, depending on the many Hindu traditions and temples. It is performed during most Hindu liturgies and occasions, and often involves circling a &quot;diya&quot; (lamp) clockwise before a murti or icon of a deity, accompanied by hymns. After waving the lamp before the deity, it is brought to the devotee, who then briefly places the palmar surface of both hands above the sanctified flame to receive its warmth. The devotee may then raise their hands in supination, bringing both palms toward to their forehead in a gesture of self-purification, and connection with the Divine. 

The &quot;diya&quot; (lamp) used for &quot;aarti&quot; is most often made of brass, or other materials, and holds a cotton wick soaked in camphor, ghee, or oil. The &quot;aarti&quot; plate may contain other offerings like flowers, incense, and &quot;akshata&quot; (rice). 

The purpose of &quot;aarti&quot; is waving light in a spirit of humility and gratitude, wherein the faithful become immersed in a God&#x27;s divine form. All accoutrements used for &quot;aarti&quot; symbolize the five elements: 
# Space () - yak-tail fan
# Wind () - peacock fan
# Fire () - lamp or candle
# Water () 
# Earth () - flowers 

&quot;Aarti&quot; may also be performed at shrines within a business or home.

==Significance==
&quot;Arti&quot; is an expression of many aspects including love, benevolence, gratitude, prayers, or desires depending on the object it is done for. For example, it can be a form of respect when performed to elders, prayers when performed to deities, or hope when performed for homes or vehicles. Emotions and prayers are often silent while doing &quot;arti&quot;, but this is determined by the person carrying out the ritual or the holiday involved. It&#x27;s also believed that goodwill and luck can be taken through symbolic hand movements over the flame.

When &quot;arti&quot; is performed, the performer faces the deity of god (or divine element, e.g. Ganges river) and concentrates on the form of god by looking into the eyes of the deity to get immersed. The flame of the &quot;arti&quot; illuminates the various parts of the deity so that the performer and onlookers may better see and concentrate on the form. &quot;Arti&quot; is waved in circular fashion, in clockwise manner around the deity. After every circle (or second or third circle), when &quot;arti&quot; has reached the bottom (6–8 o&#x27;clock position), the performer waves it backwards while remaining in the bottom (4–6 o&#x27;clock position) and then continues waving it in clockwise fashion. The idea here is that &quot;arti&quot; represents our daily activities, which revolves around god, a center of our life. Looking at god while performing &quot;arti&quot; reminds the performer (and the attendees of the &quot;arti&quot;) to keep god at the center of all activities and reinforces the understanding that routine worldly activities are secondary in importance. This understanding gives the believers strength to withstand the unexpected grief and keeps them humble and remindful of god during happy moments. 

Apart from worldly activities &quot;arti&quot; also represents one&#x27;s self - thus, &quot;arti&quot; signifies that one is peripheral to godhead or divinity. This would keep one&#x27;s ego down and help one remain humble in spite of high social and economic rank. A third commonly held understanding of the ritual is that &quot;arti&quot; serves as a reminder to stay vigilant so that the forces of material pleasures and desires cannot overcome the individual. Just as the lighted wick provides light and chases away darkness, the vigilance of an individual can keep away the influence of the material world.

&quot;Arti&quot; is not only limited to god. &quot;Arti&quot; can performed not only to all forms of life, but also inanimate objects which help in progress of the culture. This is exemplified by performer of the &quot;arti&quot; waving &quot;arti&quot; to all the devotees as the &quot;arti&quot; comes to the end – signifying that everyone has a part of god within that the performer respects and bows down to. It is also a common practice to perform &quot;arti&quot; to inanimate objects like vehicles, electronics etc. at least when a Hindu starts using it, just as a gesture of showing respect and praying that this object would help one excel in the work one would use it for. It is similar to the ritual of doing auspicious red mark(s) using &quot;kanku&quot; (&quot;kumkum&quot;) and rice.

==Songs==

Hinduism has a long tradition of songs sung as an accompaniment to the ritual of &quot;arti&quot;. It primarily extols the virtues of the deity that the ritual is being offered to, and several sects have their own versions of the common &quot;arti&quot; songs that are often sung on chorus at various temples, during evening and morning artis. Sometimes they also contain snippets of information on the life of the deity.

The most commonly sung &quot;arti&quot; is that which is dedicated to all deities called Om Jai Jagdish Hare, known as &quot;the universal &quot;arti&quot;&quot;. Other arti&#x27;s are used for other deities as well such as Om Jai Shiv omkara, Om Jai Lakshmi mata, Om Jai Ambe gauri, Om Jai Adya Shakti, Om Jai Saraswati Mata, Om Jai Gange Mata, Om Jai Tulsi Mata and Om Jai Surya Bhagvaan. In Ganesha worship, the &quot;arti&quot; &quot;Sukhakarta Dukhaharta&quot; is popular in Maharashtra.

In Swaminarayan Mandirs, Jay Sadguru Swami is the &quot;arti&quot; that is sung. In most temples in India, &quot;arti&quot; is performed at least twice a day, after the ceremonial &quot;puja&quot;, which is the time when the largest number of devotees congregates.

In Pushtimarg Havelis, &quot;arti&quot; is performed by a sole &quot;mukhiyaji&quot; (priest) while &quot;Haveli Sangit&quot; (&quot;kirtan&quot;) is being sung. Devotees only watch the &quot;arti&quot; being done and do not get to take a major part in it. During bhajan or utsavs (festivals) celebrated at home, &quot;Jai Jai Shree Yamuna&quot; is sung while devotees perform &quot;arti&quot;. It is said that Sandhya &quot;arti&quot; is done to see if Lord Shrinathji had gotten hurt while playing outside because it is performed after sundown.

==Durga Puja==

During the Bengali festival Durga &quot;puja&quot; ritual drummers – &quot;dhakis,&quot; carrying large leather-strung &quot;dhak&#x27;s&quot;, show off their skills during ritual dance worships called &quot;arti&quot; or &quot;Dhunuchi dance&quot;.

==Sikhism==
In Sikhism, &quot;Gagan mai thaal&quot; is a type of &quot;arti&quot; recited by first guru, Guru Nanak in either 1506 or 1508 at Jagannath Temple, Puri, during his &quot;Udaasi&quot; (journey) to the east of the Indian subcontinent. Amritsar Sikhs sing &quot;Arti kirtan&quot;, which comprise a few &quot;shabads&quot; from Guru Nanak, Ravidas and other Bhagats and Gurus. According to them, it is the &quot;arti&quot; of divine wisdom in the form of the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; – Sikhism’s eternal Guru and chief scripture. It is considered the equivalent of bowing on one’s knees before the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;. This &quot;arti&quot; does not employ ritual items, but is instead sung after the daily recitation of the &quot;Rehraas Sahib&quot; and Ardās at Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar, and most Gurdwaras worldwide. 

An exception is the Nihang order, whose members first recite &quot;Aarta&quot; (prayers derived from &quot;banis&quot; in the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; and &quot;Sarbloh Granth&quot; – scriptures of secondary and tertiary importance in the faith), and as in Hindu practise, employ &quot;diya&quot;, flowers, conch shells, bells, incense during the ritual. This form of Sikh &quot;arti&quot; is also recited at Patna Sahib and Hazur Sahib.

<doc id="310463" wikidata="Q5116821" url="?curid=310463" title="Church of All Worlds">
<text>The Church of All Worlds (CAW) is an American Neopagan group whose stated mission is to evolve a network of information, mythology, and experience that provides a context and stimulus for reawakening Gaia and reuniting her children through tribal community dedicated to responsible stewardship and evolving consciousness. It is based in Cotati, California.
The key founder of CAW is Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, who serves the Church as &quot;primate&quot;, later along with his wife, Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart (d. 2014), designated high priestess. CAW was formed in 1962, evolving from a group of friends and lovers who were in part inspired by a fictional religion of the same name in the science fiction novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961) by Robert A. Heinlein; the church&#x27;s mythology includes science fiction to this day. 
CAW&#x27;s members, called &quot;Waterkin&quot;, espouse Paganism, but the Church is not a belief-based religion. Members experience Divinity and honor these experiences while also respecting the views of others. They recognize &quot;Gaea,&quot; the Earth Mother Goddess and the Father God, as well as the realm of Faeries and the deities of many other pantheons. Many of their ritual celebrations are centered on the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece.

==Formation==
CAW began in 1961 with a group of high school friends. One of these was Richard Lance Christie from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Christie was fascinated by the &quot;self-actualization&quot; concepts of Abraham Maslow, a renowned American psychologist, and after meeting then-Timothy Zell at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, he began experiments in extrasensory perception. It was during this time that the group read Heinlein&#x27;s science fiction novel, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961), which became the inspiration for CAW.
Heinlein&#x27;s book, combined with Maslow&#x27;s self-actualization concepts, led to the formation of a &quot;waterbrotherhood&quot; that Zell and Christie called Atl, the Aztec word for &quot;water&quot;, and also meaning &quot;home of our ancestors&quot;. Atl became dedicated to political and social change and the group grew to about 100 members.
Zell formed CAW from Atl, and filed for incorporation as a church in 1967. It was formally chartered on March 4, 1968, making it the third Pagan Church to incorporate; they followed the Church of Aphrodite, which incorporated in New York in 1939, followed by the Goddess and wilderness-based group, Feraferia, Inc. which received their incorporation on August 1, 1967. 

==Early organization and beliefs==

CAW modeled its organization after the group in Heinlein&#x27;s novel, as a series of 9 nests in circles of advancement that were each named after a planet. The basic dogma of the CAW was that there was no dogma – the basic &quot;belief&quot; was a stated &quot;lack of belief&quot;. Within their religion, the only sin was hypocrisy and the only crime in the eyes of the church was interfering with another person.

==Evolution==

Moving toward an emphasis on nature eventually led to a breaking of the relationship between CAW and Atl. By 1974, CAW had nests in more than a dozen states around the United States. That year, Zell married Morning Glory (&quot;née&quot; Diana Moore) and in 1976 he and Morning Glory settled in Eugene, Oregon and then at the Coeden Brith land in northern California. 
When Zell stepped away from central leadership, the Church of All Worlds suffered internal strife that led to most of the church dissolving. By 1978 the focus and headquarters shifted to California with the Zells and the nine-circle nest structure was revamped. CAW then served for several years as an umbrella organization for its subsidiaries.

==Subsidiaries==
Morning Glory Zell founded the Ecosophical Research Association (ERA) in 1977 to research arcane lore and legends. Its first project of note was the creation of living unicorns in 1980, after noting that early art depicts the creatures as being more goat-like than horse-like. The Zells reconstructed what they claimed was an ancient unicorning procedure, a process involving surgically manipulating the horn buds of kids during their first week of life, and created several unicorns, some of which toured with the Ringling Brothers Circus for a time. The ERA sponsored a Mermaid expedition to Papua, New Guinea, in 1985 and a later ERA project involved the May 1996 worldwide ritual to draw upon and re-activate the Oracle at Delphi. This rite involved a relatively early attempt at utilizing online community and internet-facilitated virtual community rituals conducted simultaneously across different time zones, led by Maerian Morris, another former high priestess of CAW, working from Delphi. The reactivation of Delphi was the subject of a series of six editorials in &quot;Green Egg&quot; (issues 125 through 130) from November/December 1998 through September/October 1999.
In 1978 CAW merged with Nemeton, a Pagan organization founded by Gwydion Pendderwen and Alison Harlow. In 1987 CAW also absorbed Forever Forests, another one of Pendderwen&#x27;s organizations. An outgrowth of Forever Forests was founded in 1983 by Anodea Judith, past president and high priestess of CAW, called Lifeways. 
The Holy Order of Mother Earth (HOME), founded in 1978 by the Zells, is another subsidiary, dedicated to magical living and working with the land.

Oberon and Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart have appeared at over 20 Starwood Festivals (and a few WinterStar Symposiums) over the past 25 years; because of this, there has been a Church of All Worlds presence at Starwood, called the CAWmunity, for over a decade.

==First Renaissance==

By the mid-1980s, CAW had practically ceased operation outside of Ukiah, California, where the Zells relocated in 1985. Anodea Judith assumed presidency until 1991, and the structure of the organization was revamped with plans for more nest meetings, training courses, new rituals, and publications. By the late 1980s CAW had increased membership internationally, becoming particularly strong in Australia, where it was legally incorporated in 1992.
In 1998 Oberon Zell-Ravenheart took a year-and-a-day sabbatical from his role as primate, and the church headquarters were moved to Toledo, Ohio.

==Attempted termination &amp; Second Renaissance==
In August 2004, the board of directors decided to terminate CAW due to financial and legal struggles. In January, 2006, due to the effort of Jack Crispin Cain to help save the organization, CAW was reestablished with Zells again assuming a leadership role. In 2007, &quot;Green Egg&quot;, CAW&#x27;s influential journal, returned to publication in an online format. The &quot;3rd Phoenix Resurrection of the Church&quot; continues to the present.

<text>In special and general relativity, a light cone (or &quot;null cone&quot;) is the path that a flash of light, emanating from a single event (localized to a single point in space and a single moment in time) and traveling in all directions, would take through spacetime.

==Details==
If one imagines the light confined to a two-dimensional plane, the light from the flash spreads out in a circle after the event E occurs, and if we graph the growing circle with the vertical axis of the graph representing time, the result is a cone, known as the future light cone. The past light cone behaves like the future light cone in reverse, a circle which contracts in radius at the speed of light until it converges to a point at the exact position and time of the event E. In reality, there are three space dimensions, so the light would actually form an expanding or contracting sphere in three-dimensional (3D) space rather than a circle in 2D, and the light cone would actually be a four-dimensional version of a cone whose cross-sections form 3D spheres (analogous to a normal three-dimensional cone whose cross-sections form 2D circles), but the concept is easier to visualize with the number of spatial dimensions reduced from three to two.

This view of special relativity was first proposed by Albert Einstein&#x27;s former professor Hermann Minkowski and is known as Minkowski space. The purpose was to create an invariant spacetime for all observers. To uphold causality, Minkowski restricted spacetime to non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry.

Because signals and other causal influences cannot travel faster than light (see special relativity), the light cone plays an essential role in defining the concept of causality: for a given event E, the set of events that lie on or inside the past light cone of E would also be the set of all events that could send a signal that would have time to reach E and influence it in some way. For example, at a time ten years before E, if we consider the set of all events in the past light cone of E which occur at that time, the result would be a sphere (2D: disk) with a radius of ten light-years centered on the position where E will occur. So, any point on or inside the sphere could send a signal moving at the speed of light or slower that would have time to influence the event E, while points outside the sphere at that moment would not be able to have any causal influence on E. Likewise, the set of events that lie on or inside the &quot;future&quot; light cone of E would also be the set of events that could receive a signal sent out from the position and time of E, so the future light cone contains all the events that could potentially be causally influenced by E. Events which lie neither in the past or future light cone of E cannot influence or be influenced by E in relativity.

==Mathematical construction==

In special relativity, a light cone (or null cone) is the surface describing the temporal evolution of a flash of light in Minkowski spacetime. This can be visualized in 3-space if the two horizontal axes are chosen to be spatial dimensions, while the vertical axis is time.

The light cone is constructed as follows. Taking as event &quot;p&quot; a flash of light (light pulse) at time &quot;t&quot;0, all events that can be reached by this pulse from &quot;p&quot; form the future light cone of &quot;p&quot;, while those events that can send a light pulse to &quot;p&quot; form the past light cone of &quot;p&quot;.

Given an event &quot;E&quot;, the light cone classifies all events in spacetime into 5 distinct categories:
* Events on the future light cone of &quot;E&quot;.
* Events on the past light cone of &quot;E&quot;.
* Events inside the future light cone of &quot;E&quot; are those affected by a material particle emitted at &quot;E&quot;.
* Events inside the past light cone of &quot;E&quot; are those that can emit a material particle and affect what is happening at &quot;E&quot;.
* All other events are in the (absolute) elsewhere of &quot;E&quot; and are those that cannot affect or be affected by &quot;E&quot;.

The above classifications hold true in any frame of reference; that is, an event judged to be in the light cone by one observer, will also be judged to be in the same light cone by all other observers, no matter their frame of reference.

The above refers to an event occurring at a specific location and at a specific time. To say that one event cannot affect another means that light cannot get from the location of one to the other &quot;in a given amount of time&quot;. Light from each event will ultimately make it to the &quot;former&quot; location of the other, but &quot;after&quot; those events have occurred.

As time progresses, the future light cone of a given event will eventually grow to encompass more and more locations (in other words, the 3D sphere that represents the cross-section of the 4D light cone at a particular moment in time becomes larger at later times). However, if we imagine running time backwards from a given event, the event&#x27;s past light cone would likewise encompass more and more locations at earlier and earlier times. The farther locations will be at later times: for example, if we are considering the past light cone of an event which takes place on Earth today, a star 10,000 light years away would only be inside the past light cone at times 10,000 years or more in the past. The past light cone of an event on present-day Earth, at its very edges, includes very distant objects (every object in the observable universe), but only as they looked long ago, when the known universe was young.

Two events at different locations, at the same time (according to a specific frame of reference), are always outside each other&#x27;s past and future light cones; light cannot travel instantaneously. Other observers might see the events happening at different times and at different locations, but one way or another, the two events will likewise be seen to be outside each other&#x27;s cones.

If using a system of units where the speed of light in vacuum is defined as exactly 1, for example if space is measured in light-seconds and time is measured in seconds, then, provided the time axis is drawn orthogonally to the spatial axes, as the cone bisects the time and space axes, it will show a slope of 45°, because light travels a distance of one light-second in vacuum during one second. Since special relativity requires the speed of light to be equal in every inertial frame, all observers must arrive at the same angle of 45° for their light cones. Commonly a Minkowski diagram is used to illustrate this property of Lorentz transformations. 
Elsewhere, an integral part of light cones is the region of spacetime outside the light cone at a given event (a point in spacetime). Events that are elsewhere from each other are mutually unobservable, and cannot be causally connected.

(The 45° figure really only has meaning in space-space, as we try to understand space-time by making space-space drawings. Space-space tilt is measured by angles, and calculated with trig functions. Space-time tilt is measured by rapidity, and calculated with hyperbolic functions.)

==In general relativity==

In flat spacetime, the future light cone of an event is the boundary of its causal future and its past light cone is the boundary of its causal past.

In a curved spacetime, assuming spacetime is globally hyperbolic, it is still true that the future light cone of an event includes the boundary of its causal future (and similarly for the past). However gravitational lensing can cause part of the light cone to fold in on itself, in such a way that part of the cone is strictly inside the causal future (or past), and not on the boundary.

Light cones also cannot all be tilted so that they are &#x27;parallel&#x27;; this reflects the fact that the spacetime is curved and is essentially different from Minkowski space. In vacuum regions (those points of spacetime free of matter), this inability to tilt all the light cones so that they are all parallel is reflected in the non-vanishing of the Weyl tensor.

<doc id="310477" wikidata="Q2745298" url="?curid=310477" title="Iran–United States relations">
<text>Iran and the United States have had no formal diplomatic relations since 7 April 1980. Instead, Pakistan serves as Iran&#x27;s protecting power in the United States, while Switzerland serves as the United States&#x27; protecting power in Iran. Contacts are carried out through the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C., and the US Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran. In August 2018, Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei banned direct talks with the United States. According to the US Department of Justice, Iran has since attempted to assassinate US officials and dissidents, including US President Donald Trump.

Relations between the two nations began in the mid-to-late 19th century, when Iran was known to the west as Qajar Persia. Persia was very wary of British and Russian colonial interests during the Great Game. By contrast, the United States was seen as a more trustworthy foreign power, and the Americans Arthur Millspaugh and Morgan Shuster were even appointed treasurers-general by the Shahs of the time. During World War II, Persia was invaded by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, both US allies, but relations continued to be positive after the war until the later years of the government of Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was overthrown by a coup organized by the Central Intelligence Agency and aided by MI6. This was followed by an era of close alliance between Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi&#x27;s authoritarian regime and the US government, Persia being one of the US&#x27;s closest allies during the Cold War, which was in turn followed by a dramatic reversal and disagreement between the two countries after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

Iranian explanations for the animosity with the United States include “the natural and unavoidable conflict between the Islamic system” and “such an oppressive power as the United States, which is trying to establish a global dictatorship and further its own interests by dominating other nations and trampling on their rights”, as well as the United States support for Israel (&quot;the Zionist entity&quot;). In the West, however, different explanations have been considered, including the Iranian government&#x27;s need for an external bogeyman to furnish a pretext for domestic repression against pro-democratic forces and to bind the government to its loyal constituency. The United States attributes the worsening of relations to the 1979–81 Iran hostage crisis, Iran&#x27;s repeated human rights abuses since the Islamic Revolution, different restrictions on using spy methods on democratic revolutions by the US, its anti-Western ideology and its nuclear program.

Since 1995, the United States has had an embargo on trade with Iran. In 2015, the United States led successful negotiations for a nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) intended to place substantial limits on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, including IAEA inspections and limitations on enrichment levels. In 2016, most sanctions against Iran were lifted. The Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal and re-imposed sanctions in 2018, initiating what became known as the &quot;maximum pressure campaign&quot; against Iran. In response, Iran gradually reduced its commitments under the nuclear deal and eventually exceeded pre-JCPOA enrichment levels.

According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 5% of Americans view Iranian influence positively, with 87% expressing a negative view, the most unfavorable perception of Iran in the world. On the other hand, research has shown that most Iranians hold a positive attitude about the American people, though not the US government. According to a 2019 survey by IranPoll, 13% of Iranians have a favorable view of the United States, with 86% expressing an unfavourable view, the most unfavorable perception of the United States in the world. According to a 2018 Pew poll, 39% of Americans say that limiting the power and influence of Iran should be a top foreign policy priority. Relations tend to improve when the two countries have overlapping goals, such as repelling Sunni militants during the Iraq War and the intervention against the Islamic State in the region.

== Early relations ==
American newspapers in the 1720s were uniformly pro-Iranian, especially during the revolt of Afghan emir Mahmud Hotak () against the Safavid dynasty.

Political relations between Qajar Persia and the United States began when the Shah of Iran, Nassereddin Shah Qajar, officially dispatched Iran&#x27;s first ambassador, Mirza Abolhasan, to Washington, D.C. in 1856. In 1883, Samuel G. W. Benjamin was appointed by the United States as the first official diplomatic envoy to Iran; however, ambassadorial relations were not established until 1944. The first Iranian Ambassador to the United States of America was Mirza Albohassan Khan Ilchi Kabir. Justin Perkins and Asahel Grant were the first missionaries dispatched to Iran in 1834 via the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.

The US had little interest in Persian affairs, while the US as a trustworthy outsider did not suffer. The Persians again sought the US for help in straightening out its finances after World War I. This mission was opposed by powerful vested interests and eventually was withdrawn with its task incomplete.

Amir Kabir, Prime Minister under Nasereddin Shah, also initiated direct contacts with the American government in Washington. By the end of the 19th century, negotiations were underway for an American company to establish a railway system from the Persian Gulf to Tehran.

Until World War II, relations between Iran and the United States remained cordial. As a result, many Iranians sympathetic to the Persian Constitutional Revolution came to view the US as a &quot;third force&quot; in their struggle to expel British and Russian dominance in Persian affairs. American industrial and business leaders were supportive of Iran&#x27;s drive to modernize its economy and to expel British and Russian influence from the country.
During the Persian Constitutional Revolution in 1909, American Howard Baskerville died in Tabriz while fighting with a militia in a battle against royalist forces. After the Iranian parliament appointed United States financier Morgan Shuster as Treasurer General of Iran in 1911, an American was killed in Tehran by gunmen thought to be affiliated with Russian or British interests. Shuster became even more active in supporting the Constitutional Revolution of Iran financially. When Iran&#x27;s government ordered the Shah&#x27;s brother &quot;Shu&#x27;a al-Saltaneh&quot; (شعاع السلطنه), who was aligned with the goals of Imperial Russia in Iran, to surrender his assets, Shuster moved to execute the seizure. Imperial Russia immediately landed troops in Bandar Anzali, demanding a recourse and apology from the Persian government. Russia&#x27;s General Liakhov subsequently shelled Iran&#x27;s parliament in Tehran as part of actions to protect Russia&#x27;s interests, and Morgan Shuster was forced to resign under British and Russian pressure. Shuster&#x27;s book, &quot;The Strangling of Persia,&quot; is a first-person recounting of these events from his perspective and is critical of British and Russian influence in Persia.

The American Embassy first reported to the Iran desk at the Foreign Office in London about the popular view of Britain&#x27;s involvement in the 1921 coup that brought Reza Shah to power. A British Embassy report from 1932 admitted that the British government put Reza Shah &quot;on the throne&quot;. At that time, Iran did not view the United States as an ally of Britain.

In 1936, Iran withdrew its ambassador in Washington for nearly one year after the publication of an article criticizing Reza Shah in the &quot;New York Daily Herald&quot;.

Morgan Shuster was followed by Arthur Millspaugh, who was appointed Treasurer General by Reza Shah, and Arthur Pope, who was a driving force behind the Persian Empire revivalist policies of Reza Shah. Friendly relations between the United States and Iran lasted until the 1950s.

== Reign of the last Shah of Iran ==
In 1941 the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran deposed Reza Shah because of his lean toward the Axis. The invaders established a supply route of massive shipments of Lend lease war material to the Soviet Union. From 1942 US troops were involved in the operation of this Persian Corridor.

The last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, maintained ties with the United States during most of his reign, which lasted from 1941 until 1979. He pursued a modernizing economic policy and made a number of visits to America.

Iran&#x27;s border with the Soviet Union, and its position as the largest, most powerful country in the oil-rich Persian Gulf, made Iran a &quot;pillar&quot; of US foreign policy in the Middle East. Prior to the Iranian Revolution of 1979, many Iranian citizens, especially students, resided in the United States and had a positive and welcoming attitude toward America and Americans. In the 1970s, approximately 25,000 American technicians were deployed to Iran to maintain military equipment (such as F-14s) that had been sold to the Shah&#x27;s government. From 1950 to 1979, an estimated 800,000 to 850,000 Americans had visited or lived in Iran, and had often expressed their admiration for the Iranian people.

=== Prime Minister Mossadeq and his overthrow ===
In 1953, the government of prime minister Mohammed Mossadeq was overthrown in a coup organized by the CIA and MI6. Many liberal Iranians believe that the coup and the subsequent U.S. support for the shah proved largely responsible for his arbitrary rule, which led to the &quot;deeply anti-American character&quot; of the 1979 revolution.
One result of the 1953 coup was that the U.S. took about 40% of Britain&#x27;s share of Iranian oil, as part of the wider transition from British to American dominance in the region and worldwide.

Until the outbreak of World War II, the United States had no active policy toward Iran. When the Cold War began, the United States was alarmed by the attempt by the Soviet Union to set up separatist states in Iranian Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, as well as its demand for military rights to the Dardanelles in 1946. This fear was enhanced by the loss of China to communism, the uncovering of Soviet spy rings, and the start of the Korean War.

In 1952 and 1953, the Abadan Crisis took place when Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mossadeq began nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). Established by the British in the early 20th century, the company shared profits (85% for Britain, and 15% for Iran), but the company withheld their financial records from the Iranian government. By 1951, Iranians supported nationalization of the AIOC, and Parliament unanimously agreed to nationalize its holding of, what was at the time, the British Empire&#x27;s largest company. The British government retaliated with an embargo on Iranian oil, which was supported by international oil companies. Over the following months, negotiations over control and compensation for the oil were deadlocked, and Iran&#x27;s economy deteriorated.

U.S. President Harry S. Truman pressed Britain to moderate its position in the negotiations and to not invade Iran. American policies created a feeling in Iran that the United States was on Mossadeq&#x27;s side and optimism that the oil dispute would soon be settled with &quot;a series of innovative proposals&quot;, giving Iran &quot;significant amounts of economic aid&quot;. Mossadeq visited Washington, and the American government made &quot;frequent statements expressing support for him.&quot;

At the same time, the United States honored the British embargo and, without Truman&#x27;s knowledge, the Central Intelligence Agency station in Tehran had been &quot;carrying out covert activities&quot; against Mosaddeq and the National Front &quot;at least since the summer of 1952&quot;.

==== 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état ====

As the Cold War intensified, oil negotiations stalled, and Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower replaced Democratic President Harry S. Truman, the United States helped destabilize Mosaddeq on the theory that &quot;rising internal tensions and continued economic deterioration...might lead to a breakdown of government authority and open the way for at least a gradual assumption of control&quot; by Iran&#x27;s well organized Tudeh communist party. In spring and summer 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency and MI6 carried out Operation Ajax, conducted from the American Embassy in Tehran, helping to organize a coup d&#x27;état to overthrow the Mossadeq government. The operation initially failed and the Shah fled to Italy, but a second attempt succeeded and Mosaddeq was imprisoned.

According to a study of the coup headed by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, &quot;it was geostrategic considerations, rather than a desire to destroy Mosaddeq&#x27;s movement, to establish a dictatorship in Iran or to gain control over Iran&#x27;s oil, that persuaded U.S. officials to undertake the coup.&quot; Gasiorowski concludes the study; &quot;Consequently, while the
United States delivered the final blow to Mosaddeq&#x27;s regime, Iranian actors —
together with the British and the major international oil companies — played
crucial roles as well.&quot; The events leading to the coup were directly precipitated by Iran&#x27;s nationalization of oil. Prior to nationalization, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had control over Iran&#x27;s oil. After the coup, in 1954, oil control was 40% AIOC (renamed British Petroleum), 40% US oil companies, 13% Royal Dutch/Shell, and 6% CFP (French).

In an editorial celebrating the coup, the New York Times stated: &quot;Underdeveloped countries with rich resources now have an object lesson in the heavy cost that must be paid by one of their numbers which goes berserk with fanatical nationalism.&quot;

==== Post-coup ====

Following the coup, the United States financed the re-installed Shah. Washington gave Iran $68 million in emergency aid in the first three weeks, and an additional $1.2 billion over the next decade. In this era, until the fall of the Shah in 1979, Iran was one of the United States&#x27; closest allies. The US played a critical role in founding the Shah&#x27;s brutal secret police to keep him in power. A US Army colonel working for the CIA was sent to Persia in September 1953 to guide local personnel in creating the organization. In March 1955, the colonel was &quot;replaced with a more permanent team of five career CIA officers, including specialists in covert operations, intelligence analysis, and counterintelligence, including Major General Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf who &quot;trained virtually all of the first generation of SAVAK personnel.&quot; In 1956 this agency was reorganized and given the name &quot;Sazeman-e Ettela&#x27;at va Amniyat-e Keshvar&quot; (SAVAK). These in turn were replaced by SAVAK&#x27;s own instructors in 1965.

The Shah received significant American support during his reign. He frequently made state visits to the White House, and received praise from numerous American presidents. The Shah&#x27;s close ties to Washington and his Westernization policies soon angered some Iranians, especially Islamists.

In America the coup was originally considered a triumph of covert action, but later came to be considered by many to have left &quot;a haunting and terrible legacy.&quot; In 2000, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, called it a &quot;setback for democratic government&quot; in Iran. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei condemned the admission as &quot;deceitful&quot;, complaining that it &quot;did not even include an apology&quot;.

=== Nuclear support ===
The U.S. helped Iran create its nuclear program in 1957 by providing Iran its first nuclear reactor and nuclear fuel, and after 1967 by providing Iran with weapons grade enriched uranium.

Iran&#x27;s nuclear program was launched as part of the Atoms for Peace program. The participation of the U.S. and Western European governments continued until the 1979 Iranian Revolution. 
After that while the non-aligned nations had actively supported Iran&#x27;s right to enrich uranium for years, the U.S. and E.U. assert that Iran poses the greatest threat to international peace. The United States has reported Arab support for its stance on Iran here.
However, in multiple polls, Arab people have indicated that they do not see it as a serious threat. They consider Israel and America a danger.
The United States reached a deal in 2015 to limit Iran&#x27;s nuclear capabilities. Sanctions relief under the terms of the deal freed over 100 billion dollars in frozen assets overseas for Iran and increased foreign access to the Iranian economy. In return, Iran agreed not to engage in certain activities, including research and development of a nuclear bomb. The United States withdrew from the deal in 2018.

=== Cultural relations ===
Relations in the cultural sphere remained cordial until 1979. Pahlavi University, Sharif University of Technology, and Isfahan University of Technology, three of Iran&#x27;s top academic universities, were directly modeled on private American institutions such as the University of Chicago, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania. The Shah was generous in awarding American universities with financial gifts. For example, the University of Southern California received an endowed chair of petroleum engineering, and a million dollar donation was given to the George Washington University to create an Iranian Studies program.

=== Growth of oil revenues ===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Iran&#x27;s oil revenues grew considerably. Starting in the mid-1960s, this &quot;weakened U.S. influence in Iranian politics&quot; while strengthening the power of the Iranian state vis-a-vis the Iranian public. According to scholar Homa Katouzian, this put the United States &quot;in the contradictory position of being regarded&quot; by the Iranian public &quot;as the chief architect and instructor of the regime,&quot; while &quot;its real influence&quot; in domestic Iranian politics and policies &quot;declined considerably&quot;. With oil revenue growing, the United States and Iran&#x27;s relationship grew stronger and more stable.

James Bill and other historians have said that between 1969 and 1974 U.S. President Richard Nixon actively recruited the Shah as an American puppet and proxy. However, Richard Alvandi argues that it worked the other way around, with the Shah taking the initiative. President Nixon, who had first met the Shah in 1953, regarded him as a westernizing anticommunist statesman who deserved American support now that the British were withdrawing from the region. They met in 1972 and the Shah agreed to buy large quantities of American military hardware, and took responsibility for ensuring political stability and fighting off Soviet subversion throughout the region.

=== 1977–79: Carter administration ===

In the late 1970s, American President Jimmy Carter emphasized human rights in his foreign policy, but went easy in private with the Shah. By 1977, Iran had garnered unfavorable publicity in the international community for its bad human rights record. That year, the Shah responded to Carter&#x27;s &quot;polite reminder&quot; by granting amnesty to some prisoners and allowing the Red Cross to visit prisons. Through 1977, liberal opposition formed organizations and issued open letters denouncing the Shah&#x27;s regime.

Carter angered anti-Shah Iranians with a New Year&#x27;s Eve 1978 toast to the Shah in which he said:
Under the Shah&#x27;s brilliant leadership Iran is an island of stability in one of the most troublesome regions of the world. There is no other state figure whom I could appreciate and like more.

Observers disagree over the nature of United States policy toward Iran under Carter as the Shah&#x27;s regime crumbled. According to historian Nikki Keddie, the Carter administration followed &quot;no clear policy&quot; on Iran. The US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski &quot;repeatedly assured Pahlavi that the U.S. backed him fully&quot;. At the same time, officials in the State Department believed the revolution was unstoppable. After visiting the Shah in 1978, Secretary of the Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal complained of the Shah&#x27;s emotional collapse. Brzezinski and Energy Secretary James Schlesinger were adamant in assurances that the Shah would receive military support.

Sociologist Charles Kurzman argues that the Carter administration was consistently supportive of the Shah and urged the Iranian military to stage a &quot;last-resort coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

== Islamic Revolution ==

The Islamic Revolution (1978–1979) ousted the Shah and replaced him with the anti-American Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The United States government State Department and intelligence services &quot;consistently underestimated the magnitude and long-term implications of this unrest&quot;. Six months before the revolution culminated, the CIA had produced a report stating that &quot;Iran is not in a revolutionary or even a &#x27;prerevolutionary&#x27; situation.&quot;

Revolutionary students feared the power of the United States, particularly the CIA, to overthrow a new Iranian government. One source of this concern was a book by CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt Jr. titled &quot;Countercoup: The Struggle for Control of Iran&quot;. Many students had read excerpts from the book and thought that the CIA would attempt to implement this countercoup strategy.

Khomeini referred to America as the &quot;Great Satan&quot; and instantly got rid of the Shah&#x27;s prime minister, replacing him with politician Mehdi Bazargan. Until this point, the Carter administration was still hoping for normal relationships with Iran, sending its National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.

The Islamic revolutionaries wished to extradite and execute the ousted Shah, and Carter refused to give him any further support or help return him to power. The Shah, suffering from terminal cancer, requested entry into the United States for treatment. The American embassy in Tehran opposed the request, as they were intent on stabilizing relations between the new interim revolutionary government of Iran and the United States. However, President Carter agreed to let the Shah in, after pressure from Henry Kissinger, Nelson Rockefeller and other pro-Shah political figures. Iranians&#x27; suspicion that the Shah was actually trying to conspire against the Iranian Revolution grew; thus, this incident was often used by the Iranian revolutionaries to justify their claims that the former monarch was an American puppet, and this led to the storming of the American embassy by radical students allied with Khomeini.

=== The hostage crisis ===

On 4 November 1979, the revolutionary group Muslim Student Followers of the Imam&#x27;s Line, angered that the Shah had been allowed into the United States, occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took American diplomats hostage with the advance approval of the leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The interim government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, who opposed the hostage taking, resigned soon after. The 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days.

In Iran, the incident was seen by hardliners as a blow against American influence. Some Iranians were concerned that the United States may have been plotting another coup from the American embassy. In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as a violation of a principle of international law that granted diplomats immunity from arrest and diplomatic compounds sovereignty in the territory of the host country they occupy.

Six Americans evaded capture at the start of the crisis and were sheltered by British and Canadian diplomats until a covert operation, Canadian Caper, executed jointly by Canada and the CIA was able to rescue them. A fake film crew was created, using Canadian passports, to extract the diplomats from Iran. On January 27, 1980, the group successfully escaped through Tehran&#x27;s airport. The operation is the basis of the 2012 film, &quot;Argo.&quot;

The United States military attempted a rescue operation, Operation Eagle Claw, on April 24, 1980, which resulted in an aborted mission and the deaths of eight American military men. The crisis ended with the signing of the Algiers Accords in Algeria on January 19, 1981. On January 20, 1981, the hostages were released. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal was established for handling claims of American nationals against Iran and Iranian nationals against the United States. The crisis led to lasting economic and diplomatic damage.

On 7 April 1980, Carter severed diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States and they have been frozen ever since. Since 21 May 1980, Switzerland has been the protecting power for the United States in Iran. Contrary to usual practice, the American Embassy, Tehran was not given into the charge of the Swiss Embassy. Instead, parts of the embassy complex were turned into an anti-American museum, while other parts became offices for student organizations. Iranian interests in the US were initially represented by the Algerian Embassy. However, Algeria refused to continue being Iran&#x27;s protecting power in 1992 resulting in Pakistan representing Iran&#x27;s interests in the United States.

=== Economic consequences of the Iran hostage crisis ===
Before the Revolution, the United States was Iran&#x27;s foremost economic, technical and military partner. This facilitated the modernization of Iran&#x27;s infrastructure and industry, with as many as 30,000 American expatriates residing in the country in a technical, consulting, or teaching capacity. Some analysts argue that the transformation may have been too rapid, fueling unrest and discontent among an important part of the population in the country and leading to the Revolution in 1979.

After the 1979 seizure of the American Embassy, Carter&#x27;s Executive Order 12170 froze about $12 billion in Iranian assets, including bank deposits, gold and other properties. According to American officials, most of those were released in 1981 as part of the Algiers Accords to release the hostages. Some assets remain frozen—Iranian officials say $10 billion, but US officials say much less—pending resolution of legal claims arising from the Revolution.

Commercial relations between Iran and the United States are restricted by American sanctions and consist mainly of Iranian purchases of food, spare parts, and medical products, as well as American purchases of carpets and food. Sanctions imposed in 1995 by President Bill Clinton were renewed by President George W. Bush, who cited the &quot;unusual and extraordinary threat&quot; to American national security posed by Iran. The 1995 executive orders prohibit American companies and their foreign subsidiaries from conducting business with Iran, while banning any &quot;contract for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran&quot;. In addition, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (ILSA) imposed mandatory and discretionary sanctions on non-American companies investing more than $20 million annually in the Iranian oil and natural gas sectors.

The ILSA was renewed for five more years in 2001. Congressional bills in 2006 extended and added provisions to the act; on September 30, 2006, the act was renamed the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) as it no longer applied to Libya. On December 1, 2016, ISA was extended for a further ten years.

== 1981–1989: Reagan administration ==
=== Iran–Iraq War ===

American intelligence and logistical support played a crucial role in arming Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War. However, Bob Woodward states that the United States gave information to both sides, hoping &quot;to engineer a stalemate&quot;. In search for a new set or order in this region, Washington adopted a policy designed to contain both sides economically and militarily. During the second half of the Iran–Iraq War, the Reagan administration pursued several sanction bills against Iran; on the other hand, it established full diplomatic relations with Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist government in Iraq by removing it from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism in 1984. According to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, the administrations of Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous dual-use items, including poisonous chemicals and deadly biological viruses, such as anthrax and bubonic plague. The Iran–Iraq War ended with both agreeing to a ceasefire in 1988.

=== 1983: Hezbollah bombings ===

Hezbollah, a Shi&#x27;ite Islamist organization and client of Iran, has been involved in several anti-American terrorist attacks. These include the April 1983 United States Embassy bombing on the American Embassy in Beirut which killed 63 people including 17 Americans, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing which killed 241 US Marines, and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing.

In 2003, United States District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth declared that the Islamic Republic of Iran was responsible for the 1983 attack in a 2003 case brought by the victims&#x27; families. Lamberth concluded that Hezbollah was formed under the auspices of the Iranian government, was completely reliant on Iran in 1983, and assisted Iranian Ministry of Information and Security agents in carrying out the operation. An American federal court also found that the Khobar Towers bombing was authorized by Ali Khamenei, then ayatollah of Iran.

=== 1983: Anti-communist purge ===
According to the Tower Commission report:
In 1983, the U.S. helped bring to the attention of Tehran the threat inherent in the extensive infiltration of the government by the communist Tudeh Party and Soviet or pro-Soviet cadres in the country. Using this information, the Khomeini government took measures, including mass executions, that virtually eliminated the pro-Soviet infrastructure in Iran.

=== Iran–Contra Affair ===

To evade congressional rules regarding an arms embargo, officials in President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration arranged in the mid-1980s to sell arms to Iran in an attempt to improve relations and obtain their influence in the release of hostages held in Lebanon. Oliver North of the National Security Council diverted proceeds from the arms sale to fund anti-Marxist Contra rebels in Nicaragua. In November 1986, Reagan issued a statement denying the arms sales. One week later, he confirmed that weapons had been transferred to Iran, but denied that they were part of an exchange for hostages. Later investigations by Congress and an independent counsel disclosed details of both operations and noted that documents relating to the affair were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials on national security grounds.

=== United States attack of 1988 ===

In 1988, the United States launched Operation Praying Mantis in retaliation for Iran&#x27;s mining parts of the Persian Gulf during the Iran–Iraq War. The attack followed Operation Nimble Archer. The attack was the largest American naval combat operation since World War II. American action began with coordinated strikes by two surface groups that neutralized the Sassan oil platform and the Sirri oil platform of Iran. Iran lost one major warship and a smaller gunboat. Damage to the oil platforms was eventually repaired. Iran sued for reparations at the International Court of Justice, stating that the United States breached the 1955 Treaty of Amity. The court dismissed the claim. The American attack helped pressure Iran to agree to a ceasefire with Iraq later that summer.

=== 1988: Iran Air Flight 655 ===

On July 3, 1988, near the end of the Iran–Iraq War, the US Navy guided missile cruiser USS &quot;Vincennes&quot;, in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Earnest Will, accidentally shot down an Iranian Airbus A300B2 during a scheduled commercial flight in Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. There were 290 civilian casualties from six nations. The United States initially stated that flight 655 was a warplane, that it was outside the civilian air corridor, and did not respond to radio calls. Despite a formal investigation concluding that the downing was an accident in a combat environment, the Iranian government claimed the attack was intentional. Iran rejected mistaken identification, arguing that this constituted gross negligence and recklessness amounting to an international crime. Iran sued the United States in the International Court of Justice leading to a settlement with the United States paying tens of millions in compensation to the victims&#x27; families. The United States has expressed regret for the loss of innocent life with the military describing it as &quot;a tragic and regrettable accident&quot;.

The men of the &quot;Vincennes&quot; were all awarded Combat Action Ribbons for completion of their tours in a combat zone. The air-warfare coordinator received the Navy Commendation Medal. The medal citation noted his ability to &quot;quickly and precisely complete the firing procedure.&quot; In 1990, Rogers was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service as the Commanding Officer of the &quot;Vincennes&quot;, and the citation made no mention of the downing of Iran Air 655.

== 1989–1993: George H. W. Bush administration ==
Newly elected U.S. president George H. W. Bush announced a &quot;goodwill begets goodwill&quot; gesture in his inaugural speech on 20 January 1989. The Bush administration urged President of Iran Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to use Iran&#x27;s influence in Lebanon to obtain the release of the remaining US hostages held by Hezbollah. Bush indicated there would be a reciprocal gesture toward Iran by the United States. Bush&#x27;s national security advisor Brent Scowcroft said in 1991 it might be possible to take Iran off the terrorist list, reduce economic sanctions, and further compensate Iranians for shooting down an Iranian civilian Airbus. However, the Bush administration did not respond to Iran&#x27;s gesture, even after the last hostage was released in December 1991.

== 1993–2001: Clinton administration ==

In April 1995, a total embargo on dealings with Iran by American companies was imposed by President Bill Clinton. This ended trade, which had been growing following the end of the Iran–Iraq War. The next year, the American Congress passed the Iran-Libya Sanctions act, designed to prevent other countries from making large investments in Iranian energy. The act was denounced by the European CC as invalid, but it blocked some investment for Iran.

=== Khatami and Iranian reformers ===
In January 1998, newly elected Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called for a &quot;dialogue of civilizations&quot; with the United States. In the interview, Khatami invoked Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Democracy in America&quot; to explain similarities between American and Iranian quests for freedom. American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright responded positively. This brought free travel between the countries as well as an end to the American embargo of Iranian carpets and pistachios. Relations then stalled due to opposition from Iranian conservatives and American preconditions for discussions, including changes in Iranian policy on Israel, nuclear energy, and support for terrorism.

==== Inter-Parliamentary (Congress-to-Majlis) informal talks ====
On August 31, 2000, four United States Congress members, Senator Arlen Specter, Representative Bob Ney, Representative Gary Ackerman, and Representative Eliot L. Engel held informal talks in New York City with several Iranian leaders. The Iranians included Mehdi Karroubi, speaker of the Majlis of Iran (Iranian Parliament); Maurice Motamed, a Jewish member of the Majlis; and three other Iranian parliamentarians.

== 2001–2005: George W. Bush administration, first term ==
=== September 11 attacks ===

On September 25, 2001, Iran&#x27;s president Mohammad Khatami meeting British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said: &quot;Iran fully understands the feelings of the Americans about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11.&quot; He said although the American administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in Iran (since 1979), the Iranians instead felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved Americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities. He also stated that &quot;Nations should not be punished in place of terrorists.&quot; According to Radio Farda&#x27;s website, when the attacks&#x27; news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran (US interests protecting office in Iran), to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. This piece of news at Radio Farda&#x27;s website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, the United States Department of State published a post at its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people&#x27;s kindness on those harsh days. The attacks were condemned by both the President and the Supreme Leader of Iran. BBC and &quot;Time&quot; magazine published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by Iranian citizens at their websites. According to &quot;Politico magazine&quot;, following the attacks, Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, &quot;suspended the usual &quot;Death to America&quot; chants at Friday prayers&quot; temporarily. The military forces of the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Iran cooperated with each other to overthrow the Taliban regime which had conflicts with the government of Iran. Iran&#x27;s Quds Force helped US forces and Afghan rebels in 2001 uprising in Herat.

=== &quot;Axis of evil&quot; speech ===

On January 29, 2002—four months after 9/11, US President Bush gave his &quot;Axis of evil&quot; speech, describing Iran, along with North Korea and Iraq, as an axis of evil and warning that the proliferation of long-range missiles developed by these countries constituted terrorism and threatened the United States. The speech caused outrage in Iran and was condemned by reformists and conservatives.

Since 2003, the United States has been flying unmanned aerial vehicles, launched from Iraq, over Iran to obtain intelligence on Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, reportedly providing little new information. The Iranian government has described the surveillance as illegal.

=== Alleged &quot;Grand Bargain&quot; proposal ===

On 4 May 2003, the Swiss government sent the U.S. State Department an unsigned one-page memorandum, which was not on official letterhead, and contained a cover letter by Swiss diplomat Tim Guldimann which laid out a roadmap for discussions between Iran and the U.S. Under the heading of &quot;U.S. aims&quot;, the document stated that Iran was willing to put the following aims on the agenda: Accepting the two-states approach to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, ending material support to Palestinian opposition groups from Iranian territory, pressuring Hezbollah to become an exclusively political and social organization within Lebanon, supporting political stabilization and the establishment of democratic institutions in Iraq, taking decisive action against any terrorists (above all al Qaeda) on Iranian territory, and fully cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure there are no Iranian endeavors to develop or possess WMD.

Under &quot;Iran aims&quot;, the document stated the U.S. accepts a dialogue and agrees that Iran puts the following aims on the agenda: Ending U.S. efforts to change the political system in Iran, abolishing all sanctions, taking action against the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MKO), recognizing Iran&#x27;s legitimate security interests in the region, and granting Iran access to peaceful nuclear, biotechnology, and chemical technologies. In the cover letter, Guldimann claimed that he developed the &quot;Roadmap&quot; with Sadeq Kharrazi, the Iranian ambassador in Paris, and that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei agreed with 85–90% of the paper, although he could not obtain a precise answer on what exactly the Leader explicitly has agreed. The Bush administration did not respond to the proposal, although in March 2004 President Bush sent Mohamed ElBaradei to Tehran with the message that &quot;an Iranian representative with the authority to make a deal should go to the U.S. and Bush himself would personally lead&quot; negotiations to &quot;resolve all the issues between us;&quot; according to Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian leadership decided &quot;we should not negotiate with the U.S.,&quot; even though &quot;the Americans had taken the first step.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Nicholas Kristof and others popularized the notion that hard-liners in the Bush administration killed discussion of an Iranian &quot;Grand Bargain&quot; that &quot;could have saved lives in Iraq, isolated Palestinian terrorists and encouraged civil society groups in Iran,&quot; concluding: &quot;officials from the repressive, duplicitous government of Iran pursued peace more energetically and diplomatically than senior Bush administration officials—which makes me ache for my country.&quot; Kristof claimed Iran sent its own master text of the proposal to the State Department and, through an intermediary, to the White House. However, evidence casts doubt on the genuineness of this proposal, which may have merely been an invention of Guldimann, who sought to promote U.S.–Iran rapprochement. Michael Rubin noted that &quot;Guldimann told different people different things about the document&#x27;s origin,&quot; while the Swiss Foreign Ministry refused to back up Guldimann&#x27;s account. Iranian and U.S. officials were engaged in a series of secret, high-level negotiations during 2003, and Iran&#x27;s UN ambassador Mohammad Javad Zarif had met with U.S. diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad on May 3–one day prior to the State Department receiving the alleged &quot;Grand Bargain.&quot; Glenn Kessler asked &quot;If Iran was serious, why would such an important diplomatic undertaking be transmitted in such a haphazard way through the Swiss ambassador when one of the supposed co-authors was already holding senior-level talks with U.S. officials?&quot; Similarly, Rubin declared: &quot;Guldimann&#x27;s ignorance of these ongoing discussions exposed his fraud.&quot; Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage recounted that U.S. officials &quot;couldn&#x27;t determine what was the Iranians&#x27; and what was the Swiss ambassador&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;nothing that we were seeing in this fax was in consonance with what we were hearing face to face,&quot; former National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley called the &quot;Grand Bargain&quot; the result of freelancing by a Swiss diplomat hoping to be the one to make peace between Iran and the United States, and a State Department spokesman described the document as &quot;a creative exercise on the part of the Swiss ambassador.&quot; In a 30 March 2006 email to Trita Parsi, Zarif confessed: &quot;The claims and counter claims about the source of the proposals and motivations of intermediaries remain a mystery for me. What I think is important is the fact that Iran was prepared.&quot;

=== 2003: Border incursions begin ===
Several claims have been made that the US has violated Iranian territorial sovereignty since 2003, including drones, soldiers, and the Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PEJAK). An American RQ-7 Shadow and a Hermes UAV have crashed in Iran. Seymour Hersh stated that the United States has also been penetrating eastern Iran from Afghanistan in a hunt for underground installations developing nuclear weapons.

== 2005–2009: George W. Bush administration, second term ==
In August 2005, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became Iran&#x27;s president. On 8 May 2006, he sent a personal letter to President Bush to propose &quot;new ways&quot; to end Iran&#x27;s nuclear dispute. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley dismissed it as a negotiating ploy and publicity stunt that did not address American concerns about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. Ahmadinejad later said that &quot;the letter was an invitation to monotheism and justice&quot;.

Bush insisted in August 2006 that there must be consequences for Iran&#x27;s continued enrichment of uranium. He said that &quot;the world now faces a grave threat from the radical regime in Iran.&quot; Ahmadinejad invited Bush to a debate at the UN General Assembly, which was to take place on September 18, 2006. The debate was to be about Iran&#x27;s right to enrich uranium. The invitation was promptly rejected by White House spokesman Tony Snow.

In November 2006, Ahmadinejad wrote an open letter to the American people, stating that dialogue was urgently needed because of American activities in the Middle East and that the United States was concealing the truth about relations.

In September 2007, Ahmadinejad addressed the UN General Assembly. Prior to this, he gave a speech at Columbia University, where university president Lee Bollinger used his introduction to portray the Iranian leader as uneducated about the Holocaust and having the policies of a &quot;cruel and petty dictator&quot;. Ahmadinejad answered a query about the treatment of gays in Iran by saying: &quot;We don&#x27;t have homosexuals like in your country. We don&#x27;t have that in our country. We don&#x27;t have this phenomenon; I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s told you we have it&quot;. An aide later stated that he was misrepresented and was actually saying that &quot;compared to American society, we don&#x27;t have many homosexuals&quot;. Ahmadinejad was not permitted to lay a wreath at the World Trade Center site. He stated, &quot;Many innocent people were killed there. ... We obviously are very much against any terrorist action and any killing. And also we are very much against any plots to sow the seeds of discord among nations. Usually, you go to these sites to pay your respects. And also to perhaps to air your views about the root causes of such incidents.&quot; When told that Americans believed that Iran exported terrorism and would be offended by the photo op, he replied, &quot;How can you speak for the whole of the American nation? ... The American nation is made up of 300 million people. There are different points of view over there&quot;.

In an April 2008 speech, Ahmadinejad described the September 11 attacks as a &quot;suspect event&quot;, saying that all that happened was a building collapsed. He stated that the death toll was never published, the victims&#x27; names were never published, and that the attacks were used subsequently as pretext for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. That October, he expressed happiness about the 2008 global economic crisis. He said the West has been driven to a dead-end and that Iran was proud &quot;to put an end to liberal economy&quot;. The previous month, he had told the UN General Assembly, &quot;The American empire in the world is reaching the end of its road, and its next rulers must limit their interference to their own borders&quot;.

=== Iran&#x27;s nuclear program ===

Since 2003, the United States had alleged that Iran had a program to develop nuclear weapons. Iran maintained that its nuclear program was aimed only at generating electricity. The United States&#x27; position was that &quot;a nuclear-armed Iran is not acceptable&quot;, but officials have denied that the United States is preparing for an imminent strike. The United Kingdom, France and Germany have also attempted to negotiate a cessation of nuclear enrichment activities by Iran.

In June 2005, Condoleezza Rice said that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Mohamed El Baradei should either &quot;toughen his stance on Iran&quot; or not be chosen for a third term as IAEA head.
Both the United States and Iran are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The United States and other countries were alleged during the May 2005 NPT meeting to be in violation of the NPT through Article VI, which requires them to disarm. The IAEA has stated that Iran is in violation of a Safeguards Agreement related to the NPT, due to insufficient reporting of nuclear material, its processing and its use. Under Article IV, the treaty gives non-nuclear states the right to develop civilian nuclear energy programs. From 2003 to early 2006, tensions mounted between the United States and Iran while IAEA inspections of sensitive nuclear industry sites in Iran continued.

In March 2006, American and European representatives noted that Iran had enough unenriched uranium hexafluoride gas to make ten atomic bombs, adding that it was &quot;time for the Security Council to act&quot;. The unenriched uranium cannot be used either in the Bushehr reactor, which is a pressurized water reactor, nor in atomic bombs, unless it becomes enriched.

=== Iran fears of attack by the US ===
In 2006, the United States passed the Iran Freedom and Support Act, which appropriated millions of dollars for human rights non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in Iran. Several politicians in both countries have claimed the Act is a &quot;stepping stone to war&quot;, although the Act prohibits the use of force against Iran.

In May 2007, Iran&#x27;s top diplomat Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki stated that Iran is &quot;ready to talk&quot; to the United States. That month, Iran announced willingness, under certain conditions, to improve its relations with the United States despite having passed up the opportunity for direct talks at the Iraq conference in Sharm El-Sheikh on May 3, 2007. The conference had been seen by the Americans as an opportunity to get closer to the Iranians and exchange gestures in a public forum.

=== US covert operations inside Iran ===

In March 2006, the Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PEJAK), an opposition group closely linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) killed 24 members of the Iranian security forces. The PEJAK is linked to the PKK, which is listed by the US State Department as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Dennis Kucinich stated in an April 18, 2006 letter to Bush that PEJAK was supported and coordinated by the United States, since it is based in Iraq, which is under the de facto control of American military forces. In November 2006, journalist Seymour Hersh in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; supported this claim, stating that the American military and the Israelis are giving the group equipment, training, and targeting information in order to create internal pressures in Iran.

On April 3, 2007, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) stated that the United States had supported Jundullah since 2005. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; has described Jundullah as a militant Islamic organization based in Waziristan, Pakistan, and affiliated with Al-Qaeda that has claimed to kill approximately 400 Iranian soldiers.

The United States has escalated its covert operations against Iran, according to current and former military, intelligence, and congressional sources. They state that Bush sought up to $400 million for these military operations, which were described in a secret presidential finding and are designed to destabilize Iran&#x27;s religious leadership. The covert activities involve support of the minority Ahwazi Arab and Baluchi groups and other dissident organizations. United States Special Operations Forces have been conducting cross-border operations from southern Iraq, with presidential authorization, since 2007. The scale and the scope of the operations in Iran, which involve the CIA and the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), were significantly expanded in 2008.

=== Iraqi insurgency ===
Iran has been accused by the United States of giving weapons and support to the Iraqi insurgency (which includes the terrorist group al-Qaeda). The United States State Department states that weapons are smuggled into Iraq and used to arm Iran&#x27;s allies among the Shiite militias, including those of the anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi army. Evidence for this is that weapons, including mortars, rockets and munitions bear Iranian markings. US commanders report that these bombs inflicted 30 percent of all American military casualties in Iraq excluding Al Anbar Governorate, where these weapons have not been found. Furthermore, US intelligence has obtained satellite photographs of three training camps for Iraqi insurgents near Iran&#x27;s capital where they are allegedly trained guerrilla tactics, kidnapping and assassination.

U.S. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell stated in an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations that there was overwhelming evidence that Iran was arming the insurgency in Iraq. During his address to the United States Congress on September 11, 2007, Commanding officer for the United States forces in Iraq, General David Petraeus noted that the multinational forces in Iraq have found that Iran&#x27;s Quds force has provided training, equipment, funding, and direction to terrorists. &quot;When we captured the leaders of these so-called special groups ... and the deputy commander of a Lebanese Hezbollah department that was created to support their efforts in Iraq, we&#x27;ve learned a great deal about how Iran has, in fact, supported these elements and how those elements have carried out violent acts against our forces, Iraqi forces and innocent civilians.&quot; In a speech on , Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki said that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq.

In 2014, the United States and Iran began unofficial limited cooperation in the fight against the terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

=== 2006 sanctions against Iranian institutions ===

Pushing for international sanctions against Iran because of its nuclear program, the United States accused Iran of providing logistical and financial support to Shi&#x27;a militias in Iraq. Iran denied this claim. The American government imposed sanctions on an Iranian bank on September 8, 2006, barring it from direct or indirect dealings with American financial institutions. The move against Bank Saderat Iran was announced by the undersecretary for treasury, who accused the bank of transferring funds for terrorist groups, including $50,000,000 to Hezbollah. While Iranian financial institutions are barred from directly accessing the American financial system, they are permitted to do so indirectly through banks in other countries. He said the United States government would also persuade European financial institutions not to deal with Iran.

=== 2007: US raids Iran Consulate General ===
In 2007, US forces raided the Iranian Consulate General located in Erbil, Iraq and arrested five staff members. It was said that American forces landed their helicopters around the building, broke through the consulate&#x27;s gate, disarmed the guards, confiscated documents, arrested five staff members, and left for an undisclosed location. People living in the neighborhood were told they could not leave their homes. Three people who left their homes were arrested, and a wife of one of these men confirmed her husband&#x27;s arrest.

Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Kamynin said that the raid was an unacceptable violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The Kurdistan Regional Government also expressed their disapproval.

At a hearing in Iraq on January 11, 2007, United States Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Rice that the Bush administration did not have the authority to send American troops on cross-border raids. Biden said, &quot;I believe the present authorization granted the president to use force in Iraq does not cover that, and he does need congressional authority to do that. I just want to set that marker&quot;. Biden sent a follow-up letter to the White House asking for an explanation on the matter.

The same day, Iran&#x27;s foreign ministry sent a letter to Iraq&#x27;s foreign ministry, asking Iraq to stop the United States from interfering with Iran–Iraq relations. The official said, &quot;We expect the Iraqi government to take immediate measures to set the aforesaid individuals free and to condemn the US troopers for the measure. Following up on the case and releasing the arrestees is a responsibility of primarily the Iraqi government and then the local government and officials of the Iraqi Kurdistan&quot;.

On November 9, American forces released two Iranian diplomats after 305 days, as well as seven other Iranian citizens. The officials were captured in the raid, and the others had been picked up in different parts of the country and held for periods ranging from three months to three years. American officials said, &quot;The release followed a careful review of individual records to determine if they posed a security threat to Iraq, and if their detention was of continued intelligence value&quot;. American forces still hold 11 Iranian diplomats and citizens.

=== 2008 naval dispute ===

In January 2008, American officials accused Iran of harassing and provoking their naval vessels in the Strait of Hormuz, but Iran denied the claim. The United States presented audio and video footage of the incident, which included threats made to the Americans. Iranians have told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the accent in the recording does not sound Iranian. Iran has accused the United States of creating a &quot;media fuss&quot; and has released its own abridged video recording of the incident, which does not contain threats. There has been significant confusion as to the source of the threatening radio transmissions. According to the newspaper &quot;Navy Times&quot;, the incident could have been caused by a locally famous heckler known as the &quot;Filipino Monkey&quot;.

=== Covert action against Iran ===

In 2008, &quot;New Yorker&quot; reporter Seymour Hersh detailed American covert action plans against Iran involving the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and Special Forces. Journalist David Ignatius of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; asserted that American covert action &quot;appears to focus on political action and the collection of intelligence rather than on lethal operations&quot;. Iranian commentator Ali Eftagh stated that the covert actions are being made public by the American government as a form of psychological warfare.

===Other events (2007–08)===
A meeting in Baghdad between Iranian and American diplomats was &quot;the first formal direct contact after decades during which neither country has been willing to talk to the other.&quot; &quot;Asia Times&quot; commentator Kaveh L. Afrasiabi noted that success in Iran–United States nuclear negotiations depends on Iranian perception of American respect.

A former Iranian diplomat, Nosratollah Tajik, was arrested in the UK and accused by the United States of smuggling arms. He initially appeared in court on April 19, 2007, fighting extradition to the US.

In January 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the United States had rejected a 2008 appeal from Israel to attack Iran&#x27;s main nuclear complex.

=== 2008 US veto of Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities ===
In September 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the US vetoed Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert&#x27;s plan to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities the previous May.

== 2009–2017: Obama administration ==

Two days after Barack Obama was elected president in November 2008, Ahmadinejad issued the first congratulatory message to a newly elected American president since 1979: &quot;Iran welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts. I hope you will prefer real public interests and justice to the never-ending demands of a selfish minority and seize the opportunity to serve people so that you will be remembered with high esteem&quot;.

In his inaugural speech, President Obama said:
To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society&#x27;s ills on the West—know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.

Ahmadinejad issued a list of grievances, including the 1953 coup, support for Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq War, and the Iran Air Flight 655 incident. In March 2009, an official delegation of Hollywood actors and filmmakers met with their Iranian counterparts in Tehran as a symbol of United States–Iran relations, but Javad Shamghadri, the Arts Adviser to Ahmadinejad, rejected it and said, &quot;Representatives of Iran&#x27;s film industry should only have an official meeting with representatives of the academy and Hollywood if they apologize for the insults and accusations against the Iranian nation during the past 30 years&quot;.

On 19 March 2009, the beginning of the festival of Nowruz, Obama spoke to the Iranian people in a video saying, &quot;The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right—but it comes with real responsibilities&quot;.
=== Roxana Saberi and detained diplomats ===
In April 2009, Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi was sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted of spying for the United States. She was accused of possessing a classified document but denied the charge. After spending four months in prison, she was released in May, and the charge was dropped.

On July 9, 2009, the United States released five Iranian diplomats (Mohsen Bagheri, Mahmoud Farhadi, Majid Ghaemi, Majid Dagheri and Abbas Jami), who had been held since January 2007. Some analysts believe this was a part of hostage exchange deal between the countries. The US State Department said the release was not part of a deal with Iran but was necessary under an American–Iraqi security pact.

Kaveh Lotfolah Afrasiabi was arrested in early 2021 by the FBI and charged with acting and conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of Iran. Afrasiabi is accused of lobbying and working secretively for the Iranian government.

=== 2009 Iranian presidential election ===

On 12 June 2009, Obama said of the Iranian presidential election: &quot;We are excited to see what appears to be a robust debate taking place in Iran&quot;. Ahmadinejad&#x27;s landslide win, which led to fraud allegations and widespread protests, received little comment from the United States. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs stated, &quot;Like the rest of the world, we were impressed by the vigorous debate and enthusiasm that this election generated, particularly among young Iranians. We continue to monitor the entire situation closely, including reports of irregularities&quot;. Vice President Joe Biden said, &quot;It sure looks like the way they&#x27;re suppressing speech, the way they&#x27;re suppressing crowds, the way in which people are being treated, that there&#x27;s some real doubt&quot;. On 15 June, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly declared that the US was &quot;deeply troubled by the reports of violent arrests and possible voting irregularities&quot;.

===Detention of US hikers over Iraqi border===
Three American hikers were arrested on 31 July 2009 in Iran after they . Reports say the hikers accidentally crossed into Iran while hiking between and Ahmad Awa in the of Iraq.

=== Disappearance of Shahram Amiri ===
Iranian nuclear scientist Shahram Amiri disappeared in May 2009, and Iran accused the United States of abducting him. On 13 July 2010, the BBC reported that Amiri had taken refuge in the Iranian interests section of Pakistani Embassy in Washington, DC, and sought help to reach Iran. However, after his return to Iran, he was sentenced to ten years in prison and in August 2016 was reported to have been executed for treason.

=== Drone incidents ===

On 4 December 2011, an American Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel UAV operated by the CIA was captured by Iranian forces near the city of Kashmar. Iran claimed the drone was not only flying in sovereign airspace, but was commandeered by its cyber warfare unit and safely brought to the ground. The US initially claimed the drone had malfunctioned and crashed in Iranian airspace, only to later admit the drone was intact anonymously when footage was shown on Iranian television.

In November 2012, an Iranian Su-25 fighter jet fired on a similar MQ-1 over international waters. In November 2012, two Iranian Su-25s fired on a US drone over the Persian Gulf. The Su-25s fired at least two bursts of cannon fire, and after the drone began moving away, the Iranian aircraft chased it and did aerial loops around it before breaking off and returning to base. On 12 March 2013, an Iranian F-4 fighter jet began pursuing a US MQ-1 over international waters. The F-4 was warned against coming closer by two US fighter jets, at which point it broke off.

=== Threats to close Persian Gulf ===
In late December 2011, Iranian navy chief Admiral Habibollah Sayyari was reported to have said that it would be &quot;very easy&quot; for Iran to close the Straits of Hormuz.

On 3 January 2012 Iran&#x27;s army chief Ataollah Salehi warned &quot;We recommend to the American warship that passed through the Strait of Hormuz and went to Gulf of Oman not to return to the Persian Gulf&quot;. However, this was later denied by the Defense Minister of Iran. The warship is believed to be the American aircraft carrier which recently vacated the area as Iran conducted a 10-day naval exercise near the Strait of Hormuz. Salehi was also quoted as saying &quot;We have no plan to begin any irrational act but we are ready against any threat.&quot; The US Navy responded that it will continue with its regularly scheduled deployments, in accordance with international maritime conventions.

In 2012, the United States Navy was warned that Iran was preparing suicide attack boats and was building up its naval forces in the Gulf region. At a briefing in Bahrain, Vice Admiral Mark Fox told reporters the US Navy&#x27;s Fifth Fleet could prevent Iran from blocking the Strait of Hormuz.

The actual ability of Iran to close the strait has been questioned by experts, with estimates of the time that Iran would be able to sustain the closure ranging from a few days to over a hundred days.

=== Attempts at rapprochement ===
The visit by Iran&#x27;s President Hassan Rouhani, viewed in the West as a moderate figure, to New York City to address the United Nations General Assembly in September 2013, shortly after he assumed office, was hailed as progress in the countries′ relationship. His television interviews and public addresses while in the U.S. were seen as an effort to convey the message Iran posed no threat and that he was ready to do business with the West; the Obama administration had in turn made a symbolic gesture by making the first official U.S. acknowledgement of the CIA&#x27;s role in the ousting of Iran&#x27;s democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, he rejected US President Barack Obama&#x27;s request for a meeting with him. On 26 September, Iran and the U.S. held their first substantive high-level meeting since the 1979 revolution at multilateral talks that involved the U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the meeting being chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton. The following day, Rouhani and Obama spoke by telephone, the two countries&#x27; highest political exchange since 1979. The call led to protests by Iranian conservatives who chanted &quot;death to America&quot; when Rouhani returned to Tehran. On the 34th anniversary of the embassy siege, tens of thousands of supporters of a more hardline approach to relations gathered at the site of the former US embassy to denounce rapprochement. It was the largest such gathering in recent years. Conversely, a majority of Iranian citizens saw the progression of peace talks with the United States as a sign of hope for a future of an alliance between the two nations.

On 28 September 2015, an unplanned and &quot;accidental&quot; encounter between US President Barack Obama and Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif occurred on the sidelines of a luncheon at the United Nations General Assembly, with the two men reportedly shaking hands. It was the first handshake between a US president and a top Iranian diplomat since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who was present, also introduced Obama to two senior Iranian officials also involved in the JCPOA nuclear negotiations. The exchange was originally reported in Iranian media and was said to have lasted &quot;less than a minute&quot;; it was immediately condemned by conservative Iranian MP Mansour Haghighatpour, a member of the committee on national security and foreign policy, who called for Zarif to publicly apologize.

===Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA)===

On 14 July 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or the Iran deal) was agreed upon between Iran and a group of world powers: the P5+1 (the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France, and China—plus Germany) and the European Union. The Obama administration agreed to lift sanctions on Iran that had devastated their economy for years, in return Iran promised to give up their nuclear capabilities and allow workers from the UN to do facility checks whenever they so please. President Obama urged US Congress to support the nuclear deal reminding politicians that were wary that if the deal fell through, the US would reinstate their sanctions on Iran. Still, the lawmakers had a negative approach towards Iran, viewing it as a security threat to the US, its allies, and the international community, in line with existing stereotypical depictions of the country.

Following the deal, the U.S. supported a UN Security Council resolution that endorsed the JCPOA—the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 of 20 July 2015. The resolution welcomed &quot;Iran&#x27;s reaffirmation in the JCPOA that it will under no circumstances ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; claimed that 2 to 1 Americans supported the United States&#x27; efforts to negotiate with Iran on behalf of their nuclear capabilities. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also stated that 59% of Americans favored the lifting of sanctions on Iran&#x27;s economy in return for the power to regulate Iran&#x27;s nuclear arms. Polling group YouGov did a survey before US President Donald Trump took office and found that approximately 44% of Americans thought that the President should honor international agreements signed by past presidents. The Polling Report has reaffirmed the positive polling numbers from using sources ranging from CNN polls to ABC polls and found that the majority of America was in support of the Iran Nuclear Deal in 2015. By 2016 Gallup News reported that the overall public opinion of the US–Iran nuclear deal was at 30% approval and the disapproval was reported to be at 57%, and 14% had no opinion on the deal. In October 2017, Lobe Log (polling firm) found that about 45% of Americans were opposed to the Iran nuclear deal. The approval polls found that only 30% of Americans supported the Iran nuclear deal, staying consistent within the last year.

In February 2015, former Congressman Jim Slattery claimed to have visited Iran in December 2014 from an invitation by the Iranian government where he attended the World Against Violence and Extremism conference making him the first American lawmaker to visit the country after the Iranian Revolution. He claimed to have met with President Rouhani stating that Rouhani was &quot;deeply committed to improving this relationship with the United States&quot;. The visit came at a time during negotiations leading to the JCPOA.

=== US Supreme Court decision about frozen Iranian assets ===

In April 2016, US Supreme Court ruled Iran must pay almost $2bn to victims of 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. In response, Iranian parliament voted a bill that would obligate the government to claim compensation from the United States for its hostile actions against Iran (including 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état and United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war). Under the rules of combat, US troops have no clear legal right to sue. But the judge ruled that the troops were on a peacekeeping mission under peacetime rules of engagement. Therefore, survivors and family members could sue Iran under a 1996 law that allows US citizens to take legal action against nations that sponsor terrorism.

== 2017–2021: First Trump administration ==
Citizens of Iran and several other countries were temporarily banned from entering the United States by the executive order &quot;Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States&quot; of 27 January 2017. It did not allow Iranian citizens or those suspected of being Iranian citizens entry into the US, including Iranian passport holders, except for transit. All passengers and crew members of any nationality had to ensure they do not have Iranian entry stamps in their passports. There are no direct flights between Iran and the USA so all travel must transit through a third country, and no Iranian aircraft may enter USA airspace.

The Trump administration was seen as having embarked on the path of strengthening an informal coalition with Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and other Sunni Gulf states, with a view to rolling back Iran&#x27;s influence in the region.

While during his campaign Donald Trump had denounced the JCPOA as &quot;the worst deal ever negotiated&quot; and a disaster that could lead to a nuclear holocaust, in April 2017, the Trump administration certified that Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA.

Between January and late July 2017, Twitter had identified and shut down over 7,000 accounts created by Iranian influence operations.

In July 2017, the vast majority of congressional Democrats and Republicans voted in favor of the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea. On 2 August 2017, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi stated that, &quot;In our view the nuclear deal has been violated&quot;. In September 2017, speaking to the UN General Assembly, the countries′ presidents exchanged offensive remarks and expressed opposing views on the JCPOA.

In May 2018, Donald Trump decided to pull out of the JCPOA, announcing he would reimpose economic sanctions on Iran effective from 4 November that year. In response, the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said that if needed he would &quot;begin our industrial enrichment without any limitations&quot;. On 5 July, Iran threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz if U.S. decided to re-impose oil sanctions on Iran following US withdrawal from the JCPOA.

In late July 2018, against the backdrop of a harsh exchange of threats between the presidents of the U.S. and Iran, a large tanker flying a Saudi flag and transporting some 2 million barrels of oil to Egypt was struck in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait near the port of Hodeida by the Houthi rebels in Yemen, believed to be armed and financed by Iran. The incident, which made Saudi Arabia halt oil shipments through the strait, was seen by analysts as greatly escalating tensions. It was reported that the Trump administration was conducting a program to foment various opposition groups in Iran.

On 13 August 2018, Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned direct talks with U.S., referring to the failure of the previous ones. &quot;There will be no war, nor will we negotiate with the US&quot; and &quot;Even if we ever—impossible as it is—negotiated with the US, it would never ever be with the current US administration,&quot; Khamenei said. He added that the United States never budges on the primary goal they pursue in negotiations, which are normally based on give and take, and &quot;reneges on its own end of the bargain&quot; after the negotiation.
In November 2018, all the sanctions removed in 2015 were re-imposed on Iran by the Trump administration.

In October 2018 the International Court of Justice provisionally ordered the United States to cancel its sanctions against Iran, relying on the 1955 Treaty of Amity. In response, the United States withdrew from the treaty.

On 7 March 2019, Acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jonathan Cohen, in a letter to Secretary-General António Guterres, urged the United Nations to put new sanctions on Iran for its new missile activities.

=== IRGC and U.S. Armed Forces terrorist designations ===
The United States has opposed the activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) based on &quot;the group&#x27;s growing involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as its support for extremists throughout the Middle East&quot;. On 8 April 2019, the US Department of State announced its intent to brand the IRGC a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), effective April 15.

The Iranian parliament responded by ratifying a motion designating &quot;all legal and real persons and troops of the United States and its allies operating in the West Asian region&quot; terrorists, calling any aid to them a terrorist act and pressing the government to defuse the threat of IRGC designation through multilateral negotiations with international organizations. The nonbinding resolution cited &quot;the terrorist nature of the United States regime, particularly that part of the American military and security forces and the US Central Command which have been carrying out acts of terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iran in the past quarter-century, and have given overt support to terrorist plans.&quot; Soon after, the Supreme National Security Council cited similar concerns in declaring the IRGC designation dangerous and illegal, the United States a &quot;terrorist government&quot; and CENTCOM its primary &quot;terrorist organization&quot;.

The IRGC was placed on the FTO list for instigating and supporting insurgencies in Iraq resulting in the death of American soldiers. It allegedly operates through its Quds force in other countries in the region and in conjunction with other terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah.

The US State Department Special Briefing also warned against increasing involvement of the IRGC forces in the Syrian conflict:
On 10 April, Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary General of Hezbollah, addressed the designation in a televised speech from Beirut:
Michael Rubin, a senior research fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, said he feared the IRGC designation &quot;might exculpate the rest of the regime when, in reality, the IRGC&#x27;s activities cannot be separated from the state leadership of Supreme Leader Khamenei or President Ahmadinejad&quot;. The Iranian newspaper &quot;Kayhan&quot; quoted the commander of Iran&#x27;s elite Revolutionary Guards as threatening to deal heavier blows against the United States in response to the designation. Mohammad Khatami, former Reforms Front Iranian President hoped to &quot;remind those in the U.S. Congress or elsewhere working for the benefit of the American nation to stand against these measures or the wall between the two countries grow taller and thicker&quot;.

This would be the first time that official armed units of sovereign states are included in a list of banned terrorist groups. Kaveh L. Afrasiabi, a former consultant to the UN&#x27;s program of Dialogue Among Civilizations, stated in &quot;Asia Times Online&quot; that the move has possible legal implications: &quot;Under international law, it could be challenged as illegal, and untenable, by isolating a branch of the Iranian government for selective targeting. This is contrary to the 1981 Algiers Accords&#x27; pledge of non-interference in Iran&#x27;s internal affairs by the US government&quot;. News leaks about the prospective designation worried European governments and private sector firms, which could face prosecution in American courts for working with the IRGC.

In April 2019 the U.S. threatened to sanction countries continuing to buy oil from Iran after an initial six-month waiver announced in November 2018 expired. According to the BBC, U.S. sanctions against Iran &quot;have led to a sharp downturn in Iran&#x27;s economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.&quot; In December 2018, Iran&#x27;s President Hassan Rouhani warned: &quot;If one day they want to prevent the export of Iran&#x27;s oil, then no oil will be exported from the Persian Gulf.&quot;

=== 2019–2020 escalation in tensions ===
Tensions between Iran and the United States escalated in May 2019, with the U.S. deploying more military assets to the Persian Gulf region after receiving intelligence reports of an alleged &quot;campaign&quot; by Iran and its &quot;proxies&quot; to threaten U.S. forces and Strait of Hormuz oil shipping. American officials pointed to threats against commercial shipping and potential attacks by militias with Iranian ties on American troops in Iraq while also citing intelligence reports that included photographs of missiles on dhows and other small boats in the Persian Gulf, supposedly put there by Iranian paramilitary forces. The United States feared they could be fired at its Navy.

On 5 May, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton announced that the U.S. was deploying the Carrier Strike Group and four B-52 bombers to the Middle East to &quot;send a clear and unmistakable message&quot; to Iran following Israeli intelligence reports of an alleged Iranian plot to attack U.S. forces in the region. Bolton said, &quot;The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack.&quot; The deployed USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; is in the Arabian Sea, outside the Persian Gulf.

On 7 May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a surprise midnight visit to Baghdad after canceling a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Pompeo told Iraqi President Barham Salih and Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi that they had a responsibility to protect Americans in Iraq. On 8 May, an advisor to Ayatollah Khamenei stated Iran was confident the U.S. was both unwilling and unable to start a war with Iran. On the same day, Iran announced that it would reduce its commitment to the JCPOA nuclear deal, which the U.S. pulled out of in May 2018. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani set a 60-day deadline for the EU and world powers to rescue the current deal before it resumed higher uranium enrichment. The United States Air Forces Central Command announced that F-15C Eagle fighter jets were repositioned within the region to &quot;defend U.S. forces and interests in the region.&quot; On 10 May, the U.S. deployed the Marine transport ship and a Patriot SAM battery to the Middle East. The Pentagon said the buildup was in response to &quot;heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations.&quot; On September 10, after the resignation of U.S. national security advisor John R. Bolton, Iran stated that his resignation will not lead to talks between Washington and Tehran. On September 16, Iran said that President Hassan Rouhani will not meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the United Nations, unless sanctions on Iran are lifted.

In August 2020, U.S. intelligence officials assessed that Iran had offered bounties to the Taliban-linked Haqqani network to kill foreign servicemembers, including Americans, in Afghanistan in 2019. U.S. intelligence determined that Iran paid bounties to Taliban insurgents for the 2019 attack on Bagram airport.

==== May 2019 Gulf of Oman incident and further rise in tensions ====

On 12 May, four commercial ships, including two Saudi Aramco oil tankers, were damaged near the port of Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman. The United Arab Emirates claimed the incident was a &quot;sabotage attack&quot;, while a United States assessment reportedly blamed Iran or Iranian &quot;proxy&quot; elements for the attack. On 13 May, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad said that U.S. citizens should not travel to Iraq and for those who were already there to keep a low profile. On the same day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented a military plan to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East if Iran attacks American forces or makes steps toward developing nuclear weapons. U.S. President Donald Trump later discredited this, saying that he would instead &quot;send a hell of a lot more&quot; than 120,000 troops if necessary.

On 14 May, both Iranian and U.S. officials said they were not seeking war, even as threats and counter-threats continued. Ayatollah Khamenei downplayed the escalation, saying in comments carried on state television that &quot;no war is going to happen,&quot; while Mike Pompeo said while on a visit to Russia, &quot;We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran.&quot; On the same day, Houthi rebels in Yemen carried out multiple drone attacks on a Saudi oil pipeline deep in Saudi territory. The U.S. stated that it believed Iran sponsored the attack, though it was unclear if the attack was particularly related to the Iran–U.S. tensions or related to the Yemeni Civil War that began in 2015 and the Saudi Arabian-led intervention there. On 15 May, the U.S. State Department announced that all non-emergency staff had been ordered to leave the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

On 19 May, U.S. President Trump warned that in the event of a conflict, it would be &quot;the official end of Iran.&quot; Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded that Trump&#x27;s &quot;genocidal taunts&quot; won&#x27;t &quot;end Iran&quot;. On the same day, a rocket exploded inside the heavily fortified Green Zone sector of Baghdad, landing less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy. On 24 May, the U.S. deployed 1,500 additional troops to the Persian Gulf region as a &quot;protective&quot; measure against Iran. The deployment included reconnaissance aircraft, fighter jets and engineers; 600 of the troops were given extended deployments, meaning 900 would be fresh troops. U.S. Navy vice admiral and Director of the Joint Staff Michael Gilday said the U.S. had a high degree of confidence that Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guard was responsible for the 12 May explosions on four tankers and that it was Iranian proxies in Iraq that fired rockets into Baghdad&#x27;s Green Zone.

On 20 May, President Trump said: &quot;We have no indication that anything&#x27;s happened or will happen&quot; in Iran. On 25 May, Trump, declaring that ongoing tensions with Iran amounted to a national emergency, invoked a rarely used legal loophole to approve the sale of $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Weapons would also reportedly be sold to the UAE and Jordan. On 28 May, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran was abiding by the main terms of the JCPOA, although questions were raised on how many advanced centrifuges Iran was allowed to have, as that was only loosely defined in the deal.

On 1 June, President Hassan Rouhani suggested that Iran would be willing to hold talks but asserted that it would not be pressured by sanctions and American military posturing. On 2 June, Mike Pompeo stated that the U.S. was ready for unconditional discussions with Iran on its nuclear program, but affirmed that it will not relent on pressuring Iran until it starts behaving like a &quot;normal country&quot;. &quot;We are prepared to engage in a conversation with no pre-conditions. We are ready to sit down,&quot; Pompeo said, while also stating that President Trump had always been willing to seek dialogue with Iranian leadership. Iran&#x27;s foreign ministry responded stating, &quot;The Islamic Republic of Iran does not pay attention to word-play and expression of hidden agenda in new forms. What matters is the change of U.S. general approach and actual behavior toward the Iranian nation,&quot; which it said needed &quot;reform&quot;. The softening dialogue came amid U.S. military exercises in the Arabian Sea, which saw various aircraft &quot;simulating strike operations&quot;; Yahya Rahim Safavi, top military aide to Ayatollah Khameini, said that U.S. military vessels in the Persian Gulf were within range of Iranian missiles and warned that any clash between the two countries would push oil prices above $100 a barrel.

On 6 June, U.S. Central Command commander Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. warned that Iran and its &quot;proxy&quot; forces still posed an &quot;imminent&quot; threat to U.S. forces: &quot;I think we&#x27;re still in the period of what I would call tactical warning...The threat is very real.&quot;

==== June 2019 Gulf of Oman incident ====

On 17 June, the U.S. announced the deployment of 1,000 more soldiers to the Middle East after a second incident in the Gulf of Oman that saw two oil tankers catch fire after allegedly being attacked by limpet mines or flying objects. As in the May incident, the U.S. blamed Iranian forces for the attacks.

==== June 2019 Iranian shoot-down of U.S. drone ====

Tensions reached a new high when, on 20 June, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a U.S. RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone, claiming that the drone violated Iranian airspace. IRGC commander Hossein Salami called the shoot-down a &quot;clear message&quot; to the U.S. while also warning that, though they were not seeking war, Iran was &quot;completely ready&quot; for it. U.S. Central Command later confirmed that the drone was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles but denied that it violated Iranian airspace, calling it an &quot;unprovoked attack&quot; and in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran and the United States provided conflicting GPS coordinates for the drone&#x27;s location, making it unclear whether the drone was within Iran&#x27;s 12-mile territorial boundary. President Trump called Iran&#x27;s downing of the drone a &quot;big mistake&quot;. The United States requested a June 24 closed-door United Nations Security Council meeting to address the regional tensions with Iran, according to diplomats.

Media outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and ABC News reported that Trump had ordered a retaliatory military strike on Iran on 20 June, but withdrew his decision minutes before the operation began. Trump said the next day that he had decided to halt the operation after being told that as many as 150 Iranians would be killed, although some administration officials said Trump had been advised of the potential casualties before he ordered the operation to be prepared. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton reportedly objected to the reversal.

On June 22, it was reported that President Trump had approved cyber attacks that disabled IRGC computer systems used to control rocket and missile launches the night of the drone-downing. The cyber strikes were handled by U.S. Cyber Command in conjunction with U.S. Central Command. It represented the first offensive show of force since Cyber Command was elevated to a full combatant command in May 2019. Also on June 22, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to U.S. industries that Iran is stepping up cyber attacks of critical industries—particularly oil, gas and other energy sectors—and government agencies, and has the potential to disrupt or destroy systems.

On June 23, Iranian Major general Gholam Ali Rashid warned the U.S. of &quot;uncontrollable&quot; consequences should a conflict breakout. During a speech in Israel, then-US National Security Advisor John Bolton said Iran should not &quot;mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,&quot; emphasizing that future military options are not ruled out and that Trump had only &quot;stopped the strike from going forward at this time&quot;. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited the Persian Gulf region for talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in a bid to build a coalition to combat perceived Iranian nuclear and &quot;terror&quot; ambitions. Meanwhile, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blamed the United States&#x27; &quot;interventionist military presence&quot; for the high tensions.

On June 24, Trump announced new sanctions against the Iranian and IRGC leadership, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his office. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will block &quot;billions&quot; in assets and that Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif will also be sanctioned within the week.

In classified briefings, Mike Pompeo and other U.S. State Department and Pentagon officials reportedly advised members of the U.S. Congress on what they described as alarming ties between Iran and al-Qaeda—including giving the terrorist organization safe haven in the country. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that lawmakers were leery of assertions of Iranian links to al-Qaeda, notably due to concerns that the administration may be using specious assertions to build a case for military action against Iran based on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists—supposed links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were used as partial justification to invade Iraq in 2003. On June 27, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy flatly denied that Pentagon officials linked al-Qaeda to Iran during congressional meetings. &quot;In these briefings, none of the officials mentioned al-Qa&#x27;ida or the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force,&quot; Mulroy stated, adding that he and the Defense Intelligence Agency instead &quot;described the historical ties between Iran and the Taliban, and I explained that these ties are widely and publicly known and referenced in articles and books&quot;. On June 24, Trump told reporters that he did not need congressional consent for an initial strike on Iran.

On June 25, Iran said that the new U.S. sanctions prompted a &quot;permanent closure&quot; of their diplomatic ties, and the regime refused to negotiate with Washington until the sanctions were lifted. On June 27, Javad Zarif tweeted that sanctions are not an &quot;alternative to war; they ARE war&quot; and argued that Trump&#x27;s usage of the term &quot;obliteration&quot; against Iran is a reference to genocide, a war crime. He also said that negotiations and threats are &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; and called the concept of a short war with Iran an &quot;illusion&quot;.

Following the drone shoot-down, the U.S. continued unabated to deploy military assets to the region. By June 28, the U.S. had deployed nearly a dozen F-22 Raptor fighter jets to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar—the first-ever deployment of F-22s to the base—to &quot;defend American forces and interests&quot;.

==== July 2019 alleged American jamming of Iranian drone ====
On July 18, according to the Pentagon, took defensive action against an Iranian drone that had closed with the ship in the Persian Gulf to approximately and jammed the drone, causing downing of the aircraft. Iran&#x27;s Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi denied any of the country&#x27;s drones had been brought down. Iran showed footage of the USS &quot;Boxer&quot; in a move to disprove Donald Trump&#x27;s claims that the US shot down an Iranian drone in the Gulf.

On 15 September 2019, Iran rejected American accusations of conducting drone attacks on Saudi Arabia&#x27;s oil fields. Iran also warned that it is ready for a &quot;full-fledged&quot; war.

==== November 2019 Iran gasoline price protests ====

On 15 November 2019, Iranian authorities raised gasoline prices for civilians and imposed strict rationing rules. The 50 per cent price rise from 10,000 to 15,000 rials per litre led to an outbreak of violent protests across the country. Protesters demanded that President Hassan Rouhani step down. The gasoline price rises were introduced because of deteriorating economic conditions in Iran, which were partly due to the U.S. sanctions. On 19 November 2019, the United States expressed its support for the protesters and condemned the Iranian government. Multiple officials of the Trump administration, including Mike Pompeo and Stephanie Grisham, made statements in support of the Iranians.

US President Donald Trump said, on 3 December 2019, in an interview, while he was in London for a NATO Summit, they are &quot;killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak&quot;.

==== December 2019 Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah – U.S. attacks in Iraq ====

On 27 December 2019, a rocket attack on the K1 military base in Iraq, which houses U.S. and Iraqi forces, killed a U.S. civilian contractor and wounded several U.S. and Iraqi service members. U.S. officials stated that there was an involvement of Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Iraqi Shi&#x27;ite militia group.

On 29 December 2019, the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for the death of the U.S. contractor. At least 25 Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah fighters were killed and more than 50 wounded.

In response, Iranian-backed militia groups stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad on December 31, 2019. They burned buildings and defaced property. The group of people left the Embassy on January 1, 2020.

==== Assassination of Qasem Soleimani, Iranian retaliation and Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 shoot-down ====
On 3 January 2020, the U.S. assassinated the Iranian General Qasem Soleimani with an airstrike in Iraq. Soleimani was head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards&#x27; Quds Force, and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran behind Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. This killing steeply escalated the decades-old tensions between the two countries.

After the U.S. killed Soleimani, US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft wrote a letter to the UN Security Council in which she said that the act was one of self-defense. At the same time, she wrote in the letter that the US stood &quot;ready to engage without preconditions in serious negotiations with Iran, with the goal of preventing further endangerment of international peace and security or escalation by the Iranian regime.&quot;

Khamenei vowed &quot;severe revenge&quot; against the United States. Declaring three days of public mourning for the general&#x27;s death, Khamenei stated that &quot;harsh retaliation&quot; waited for the U.S. In the aftermath of Soleimani&#x27;s killing, the U.S. announced to move over 3,000 additional troops to the Middle East from the 82nd Airborne Division as a precautionary measure amid rising threats from Iran.

On the same day, Switzerland said it had conveyed a U.S. diplomatic message to Iran. Iran said that in the note, the United States had called for a &quot;proportional response&quot; to the killing of the Quds Force leader. In turn, Iran summoned the Swiss envoy and stated that the Americans &quot;made a wrong move and are now worried about its consequences&quot;.

On January 7, Iran&#x27;s Parliament unanimously passed a bill naming all branches of the US Armed Forces and employees of The Pentagon &quot;terrorists&quot;. The bill states &quot;Any aid to these forces, including military, intelligence, financial, technical, service or logistical, will be considered as cooperation in a terrorist act&quot;.
Later, at approximately 5:30 pm (EST), Iran carried out &quot;Operation Martyr Soleimani&quot; launching 12 to 15 missiles to strike multiple US targets located throughout Iraq, including Al-Assad Airbase where about 1,500 soldiers are housed near Erbil. After an assessment of damages, no casualties were reported. Iran later threatened action against other nations, issuing the statement on Iranian state media &quot;We are warning all American allies, who gave their bases to its terrorist army, that any territory that is the starting point of aggressive acts against Iran will be targeted.&quot;

In response Donald Trump posted via Twitter &quot;All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties &amp; damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.&quot;

Very soon after Trump&#x27;s response, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by the IRGC after being mistaken for a U.S. cruise missile killing all 176 passengers and crew.

Iran issued an arrest warrant for 36 U.S. political and military officials, including President Trump, for their role in the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.

==== March 11 attack and retaliation ====
Washington officials claimed in mid March 2020 that an Iran-backed militia group attacked a US military base in Iraq, which killed two American soldiers and a British soldier. Later, during the same week, the US military launched a missile strike against Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah in Iraq, which led to the killing of militiamen, a civilian present at the base, along with five Iraqi servicemen. In retaliation, rockets again struck near the Green Zone of the US Embassy in Baghdad.

==== New exchange of words after Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Speech ====
On 17 January 2020, after Iran attacked two U.S. military bases in Iraq, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reappeared, after eight years, in Tehran Friday Prayer and defended the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and said &quot;... The day that tens of millions in Iran and hundreds of thousands in Iraq and other countries came to the streets to honor the blood of the Quds Force commander, shaping the biggest farewell of the world,&quot; Ayatollah Khamenei said. &quot;Nothing can do that except of the powerful hand of God.&quot; he added &quot;The IRGC&#x27;s reaction was a military blow, but even beyond, it was a blow to the U.S. image as a superpower.&quot; Donald Trump replied in tweets, Khamenei &quot;should be very careful with his words!&quot;.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

Iran&#x27;s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed that the virus was genetically targeted at Iranians by the US, and this is why it is seriously affecting Iran. He did not offer any evidence.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be willing to provide coronavirus aid, such as ventilators, to Iran to help deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Military satellite ===
The Noor-1 aircraft flew into orbit on a multi-stage rocket and was launched from the Shahroud missile range in northern Iran. While not a present threat to the United States and other Iranian adversaries, the completion of the mission confirms the technical competency of the nascent Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Though lauded by the Tasnim News Agency as a national &quot;milestone,&quot; the Islamic Republic is not inexperienced in space exploration and, particularly, low-earth orbit operations. In both 2009, 2015, and 2017, Iran sent, respectively, the Omid, Fajr, and Simorgh satellites into orbit.

Despite recent setbacks with high-ranking assassinations and pandemic resistance, the 2020 launch sends a clear message to all Middle Eastern and transoceanic powers: Iran continues to make progress in its quest for regional supremacy and advanced domestic and military technology. Mounting pressure in the last decade has U.S. military and political leaders fearful of Iran&#x27;s capability of creating ballistic-carrying spacecraft. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo disapproved of Iran&#x27;s successful launch, stating that it proves that the space program is &quot;neither peaceful nor entirely civilian,&quot; but the Trump administration, supposedly, &quot;never believed this fiction.&quot; During a press conference on 22 April, Pompeo said: &quot;The Iranians have consistently said that these missile programs were disconnected from their military, that these were purely commercial enterprises. I think today&#x27;s launch proves what we&#x27;ve been saying all along here in the United States: The IRGC, a designated terrorist organization, launched a missile today.&quot;

=== Iran aids Venezuela by sending oil tankers amid US threat ===
In May 2020, five Iranian tankers carrying millions of dollars worth of petrol and similar products were sailed to Venezuela, as part of a wider deal between the two US-sanctioned nations amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington. The tankers&#x27; voyage came after Venezuela&#x27;s president Nicolás Maduro had already turned to Iran for help flying in chemicals needed at an aging refinery amid a petrol shortage, a symptom of the wider economic and political chaos gripping Latin America&#x27;s one-time largest oil producer.

The U.S. was seeking to seize Iranian tankers sailing toward Venezuela with oil and gasoline supplied by Iran, the latest attempt to disrupt ever-closer trade ties between the two heavily sanctioned anti-American allies. Reports suggested four US Navy warships were in the Caribbean for a &#x27;possible confrontation with Iran&#x27;s tankers&#x27;.

Following the US threat, in a letter to United Nations chief António Guterres, Mohammad Javad Zarif warned against &quot;America&#x27;s movements in deploying its navy to the Caribbean in order to intervene and create disruption in [the] transfer of Iran&#x27;s fuel to Venezuela&quot;. He said any such action would be &quot;illegal and a form of piracy&quot; adding that the US would be responsible for &quot;the consequences&quot;, according to a foreign ministry statement.

On 25 May 2020, Venezuela celebrated as the first of five Iranian tankers loaded with gasoline docked in the South American country, delivering badly needed fuel to the crisis-stricken nation. Rest of Iranian oil tankers arrived to their destination shortly without any disruption. The gasoline shipments were arriving in defiance of stiff sanctions by the Trump administration against both nations, and they mark a new era in the burgeoning relationship between Venezuela and Iran, which is expanding its footprint in the Western Hemisphere.

=== Iranian bounty program ===
In August 2020, U.S. intelligence officials assessed that Iran offered bounties to the Taliban-linked Haqqani network to kill foreign servicemembers, including Americans, in Afghanistan. U.S. intelligence determined that Iran paid bounties to Taliban insurgents for the 2019 attack on Bagram airport. According to CNN, Donald Trump&#x27;s administration has &quot;never mentioned Iran&#x27;s connection to the bombing, an omission current and former officials said was connected to the broader prioritization of the peace agreement and withdrawal from Afghanistan.&quot;

=== 2020 United States presidential election and US President-elect Joe Biden ===
During the 2020 United States presidential election, Iran, along with China and Russia, was suspected of foreign interference in the election. When asked by moderator Kristen Welker about how intelligence officials recently uncovered evidence of Iranian interference in the election during the 2020 United States presidential debates, Democratic candidate Joe Biden responded that Iran would &quot;pay a price&quot; for interfering in the election.

Following Biden&#x27;s victory against incumbent Donald Trump, Iran&#x27;s President Hassan Rouhani said that Biden&#x27;s administration has a chance to &quot;compensate for previous mistakes&quot;.

=== US-based &#x27;terrorist&#x27; leader arrested by Iran ===
On 1 August 2020 Iranian security forces detained US-based Iranian monarchist Jamshid Sharmahd. He was suspected of masterminding the 2008 Shiraz mosque bombing which killed 14 people and wounded 215. Iran claimed Jamshid Sharmahd, the head of pro-monarchy militant group Tondar, &quot;directed armed and terrorist acts in Iran from America&quot;. Iran views Tondar (Persian for &quot;thunder&quot;) also known as the Kingdom Assembly of Iran, as a terrorist organization. The authorities have asserted links between the group and several people in connection to the 2008 bombing.

====Assassination of Abu Muhammad al-Masri====
On 7 August 2020 Abu Muhammad al-Masri, second-in-command leader of Al-Qaeda, while driving his car in the Pasdaran neighborhood of Tehran, Iran, was shot to death by Israeli agents. On January 12, 2021, Mike Pompeo confirmed his death, although no further proof was given from either side.

== 2021–2025: Biden administration ==

Joe Biden&#x27;s choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told the Senate that he wanted a &quot;longer and stronger&quot; nuclear deal with Iran. Blinken warned that a new nuclear agreement could address Iran&#x27;s &quot;destabilising activities&quot; in the region.

In January 2021, Iran repeatedly urged the Biden administration to lift some sanctions, as the country struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic. Strict financial sanctions imposed by the Trump administration have had a negative effect on regional economies there, as countries such as India are unable to access Iranian goods for their economic survival.

On February 26, 2021, the United States Military carried out a series of airstrikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria, including Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah. The strikes took place after a militia-organized rocket attack in the Iraqi city of Erbil wounded four American contractors and one soldier.

In April 2021, over 220 US Congress leaders endorsed HR 118, a resolution expressing support for &quot;the Iranian people’s desire for a democratic, secular, and non-nuclear republic of Iran&quot; and condemning &quot;violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism&quot;.

In April 2021, JCPOA&#x27;s signatories held talks in the city of Vienna with the goal of bringing the United States and Iran back into compliance with the agreement. U.S. and Iranian officials participated in so-called close meetings in order to exchange views on how to return to the considered deal. Both sides of the talks attempted to downplay hopes for immediate progress, insisting that the other should first resume their commitments. Talks kept on after an explosion at Iran&#x27;s Natanz nuclear facility, blamed on Israel, resulted in Islamic Republic of Iran enriching uranium to a new high purity of 60%. In October 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not rule out a military intervention to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.

In March 2022, The Negev Forum, a regional cooperation framework, was established by the United States, Israel, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with the objective of deterring Iran, along with other goals unrelated to defense. Clandestinely, the United States convened military officers from Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE in the same month to discuss and tackle Iran&#x27;s drone and missile capabilities.

On March 13, 2022, Iran launched a dozen ballistic missiles toward Iraq&#x27;s northern city of Erbil, an unprecedented strike on the capital of the autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region that appeared to be aimed at the US and its allies. General Frank McKenzie, the departing CENTCOM head, told the U.S. Senate Armed Services committee that Iraq is where the United States is most vulnerable in the Middle East and where Tehran is focused in regards to the U.S. presence, but is increasingly concerned about the Iranian ballistic missile capabilities, the long-range drones and a growing Iranian arsenal which threaten the region.

On March 24, 2022, Iran&#x27;s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said that a short-term resurrection of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and international powers is possible if the US shows pragmatism in Vienna negotiations.

On March 25, 2022, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the US is still seeking negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, but that if diplomacy fails, the US will work with partners to intensify pressure on Iran.

On March 27, 2022, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US would work with Israel to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, despite the two close friends&#x27; disagreements over Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.

On March 30, 2022, following missile assaults by alleged Iran-backed proxies against countries in the region, Washington placed sanctions on an Iranian procurement agent and his companies, accusing them of assisting Tehran&#x27;s ballistic missile program.

On March 31, 2022, despite assertions to the contrary, the US continues to violate a United Nations resolution that enshrines a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, stated the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh.

On April 4, 2022, an Iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman declared that the United States is to blame for the halt in talks between Tehran and world powers in Vienna aimed at salvaging their 2015 nuclear accord.

On April 9, 2022, Iran announced penalties on 15 more US officials, including former Army Chief of Staff George Casey and former President Donald Trump&#x27;s attorney Rudy Giuliani, as efforts to resurrect a 2015 nuclear deal have stagnated for months.

On April 9, 2022, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said that Tehran would not relinquish its right to develop its nuclear industry for peaceful purposes and that all countries engaging in talks to resurrect the 2015 nuclear agreement should respect this.

On April 10, 2022, Iran&#x27;s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, said that US President Joe Biden should remove some sanctions against Iran to demonstrate his willingness to restart the international nuclear accord with Tehran.

On April 13, 2022, a senior Iranian Guards commander stated that assassinating all American leaders would not be enough to punish the US death of Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards&#x27; top commander, Qassem Soleimani, two years ago.

On April 21, 2022, the US stated that if Iran wants sanctions relief beyond the 2015 Iran nuclear deal - an apparent reference to removing Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards from a US terrorist list - it must address US concerns beyond the pact.

On April 21, 2022, despite &quot;frequent proposals&quot; from Washington to relax sanctions and grant other concessions in exchange, Iran will not abandon plans to avenge the execution of Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani by the US in 2020, a top Iranian official warned.

On May 4, 2022, the State Department stated that the US is now equally prepared for a situation in which Iran and the US return to mutual compliance on a nuclear deal, as well as a scenario in which there is no agreement.

On June 16, 2022, the US placed sanctions on Chinese and Emirati corporations as well as a network of Iranian firms that assist in the sale of Iran&#x27;s petrochemicals.

On June 29, 2022, the EU&#x27;s ambassador Enrique Mora tweeted that indirect discussions between Tehran and Washington that intended to resolve the standoff over how to save Iran&#x27;s 2015 nuclear agreement ended in Qatar without the advancement &quot;the EU team as coordinator had hoped-for.&quot;

On July 6, 2022, the United States placed sanctions on a network of Chinese, Emirati, and other businesses it accused of assisting in the delivery and sale of Iranian oil and other petrochemical products to East Asia.

On July 9, 2022, the Iranian foreign ministry stated that The United States and Israel&#x27;s preparations for a combined defense pact with Arab nations to confront the threat of Iranian drones and missiles would only exacerbate regional tensions.

On July 14, 2022, Iran stated that the Middle East will not experience stability and peace as long as Washington&#x27;s primary objective was to maintain &quot;the fake state of Israel&#x27;s security,&quot; Iranian state TV cited Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani as saying.

On July 16, 2022, Iran announced that it sanctioned 61 additional Americans, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for supporting an Iranian dissident group.

On March 12, 2023, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian claimed that the agreement for a prisoner swap was made between Iran and the United States for the release of the $7 billion in frozen Iranian oil funds. A White House official said that Amirabdollahian&#x27;s statement is false. According to the Iranian source, both Qatar and Switzerland played a role in the prisoner exchange talks. Siamak Namazi and Emad Sharghi are among the Americans imprisoned in Iran.

In July 2023 the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command stated that it had &quot;stopped Iran from seizing two commercial tankers.&quot;

On 7 August 2023, approximately 3,000 military personnel of the United States entered the Red Sea in response to the seizure of several civilian ships by Iran. Islamic Republic of Iran said it considers this American action a cause of instability in the region.

=== Iran sanctions 52 American officials in relation to the &quot;terrorist act&quot; ===
On January 8, 2022, Iran imposed sanctions on 52 United States officials, many of them from the military, adding to its blacklist of individuals whom it says played a role in the 2020 assassination of Major General Qasem Soleimani. US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, Central Command chief Kenneth McKenzie, Pentagon officials, and commanders in several US bases across the region are among individuals targeted by the sanctions.

A year earlier, Iran had imposed sanctions on former US President Donald Trump, his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and eight others who played a role in the killing of Soleimani near Baghdad airport in Iraq. It had also sought their arrest through Interpol, the international police organisation.

Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi said Trump, Pompeo and others must be tried in a &quot;fair court&quot;.

On May 25, 2022, the US imposed sanctions on Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards&#x27; Quds Force, accusing it of being part of a Russian-backed oil smuggling and money laundering network.

===Robert Malley===
In the spring of 2023, US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was fired after the FBI ran an investigation on mishandling of classified information. Tehran Times published memo of his firing.

=== Trump Iran war plans document tape ===
In June 2023, CNN reported a tape of former President Donald Trump discussing and appearing to show off classified documents pertaining to a hypothetical plan for the U.S. to invade Iran. The comments were made in the presence of two Trump aides and a writer and publisher working on former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows&#x27; memoir. The tape was cited in Trump&#x27;s federal indictment.

===September 2023 prisoner release deal===
In August 2023, a tentative deal was reached between the two countries to release five American-Iranian prisoners held by Iran in exchange for the release by the US of Iranian prisoners and about $6 billion worth of frozen Iranian oil assets in South Korea. &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that through a secret agreement in late August the United States government was already allowing Iranian access to more funds and to sell more oil.

According to documents received by &quot;Reuters&quot; from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in September 2023, for the exchange of 5 Iranian and American prisoners, the United States lifted sanctions and allowed the transfer of $6 billion of Iranian investment from South Korea to Qatar for fund Iran&#x27;s purchases of humanitarian goods. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the cancellation of these sanctions protects America&#x27;s interests. The financial institutions of Germany, Ireland, Qatar, South Korea and Switzerland can transfer these funds to Qatar regardless of sanctions. The U.S. has committed to return 5 Iranians arrested in America to Iran.

In the first week of September 2023, the U.S. State Department officially released the aforementioned $6 billion of frozen assets in South Korea to Qatar and signed the deal to finalize the prisoner exchange of five U.S. prisoners in Iran with five Iranian detainees in U.S. prisons. The prisoner swap in mid-September came after several months of difficult indirect negotiations between the two countries and marks the first real breakthrough in Iran–United States relations since the JCPOA was unilaterally withdrawn by the Trump administration in 2018. The funds will be paid to Qatar through a Swiss-based intermediary and can be used by Iran for any non-sanctioned goods. The White House acknowledged the difficult agreement but stressed the importance of an immediate release of the detainees. Upon release of the seven detainees from Iranian prisons, Secretary Antony Blinken commented in a press statement. &quot;It&#x27;s easy in the work that we do every day sometimes to get lost in the abstractions of foreign policy and relations with other countries, and forgetting the human element that&#x27;s at the heart of everything we do.&quot; He also thanked his political partners during the challenging negotiations, particularly in Oman, Switzerland, Qatar and the United Kingdom.

The prisoners were released and transferred on 18 and 19 September 2023. The five Iranian-Americans with dual nationality released by Iran were Siamak Namazi, Emad Shargi, Morad Tahbaz and two who were not identified. The five released in the U.S. were Mehrdad Moin-Ansari, Kambiz Attar-Kashani, Reza Sarhangpour-Kafrani, Amin Hassanzadeh and Kaveh L. Afrasiabi; two would return to Iran, one would join his family in another country, and two would remain in the U.S. at their request.

=== Events ensuing the start of the Gaza War ===
Following the start of the Gaza war in October 2023, Iran-backed militias began to conduct a series of attacks on US bases in the Middle East in response for the US&#x27;s support of Israel.

In November 2023, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei stated in a speech that the US has failed to accomplish its goal of creating &quot;a New Middle East&quot; and achieve its political objectives in the region. He said &quot;US plans for forming &#x27;a New Middle East&#x27; have failed: They planned to eliminate Hezbollah, but it&#x27;s 10 times stronger now. They failed to devour Iraq and Syria, and they failed to settle the Palestinian dispute for the benefit of the usurper regime [Israel] using a devious &#x27;2-state&#x27; solution.&quot; He also said Operation &quot;Al-Aqsa Flood&quot; led by Hamas was a &quot;historic event&quot; that aimed to achieve &quot;de-Americanization&quot; of the region. He also expressed hope for the &quot;elimination&quot; of US influence in the region.

On 28 January 2024, an Iranian-backed Shia militia group struck a US outpost in Jordan, resulting in the deaths of 3 US soldiers. Iran denied responsibility for the attack. In response, on 2 February 2024, the US launched a series of airstrikes targeting the IRGC and other Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq and Syria.

===2024 United States presidential election===
In August 2024, American presidential candidate Donald Trump attributed the hacking of his election campaign to Iran. His campaign team issued a statement claiming that the &quot;Iranian government has stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents&quot;. The charge followed Microsoft&#x27;s report. The report detailed foreign attempts to interfere in this year&#x27;s presidential election. A spokesman for the National Security Council said it takes any report of foreign interference &quot;extremely seriously&quot; and condemns any attempt to undermine U.S. democratic institutions. Iran&#x27;s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York announced in an email that &quot;the Iranian government has neither the intention nor the motivation to interfere in the American presidential election, nor does it have it in mind.&quot;

In September 2024, U.S. agencies claim Iranian hackers sent stolen Trump campaign material to individuals linked to Biden&#x27;s re-election team, aiming to disrupt the U.S. election. While Iran denies the allegations, officials assert this is part of broader efforts to undermine electoral confidence.

Iran&#x27;s Foreign Ministry rejected a U.S. Homeland Security report from 2 October 2024, that accused Iran of using AI to meddle in U.S. elections, labeling the allegations as unfounded and politically motivated. The U.S. report warned that Iran, China, and Russia might use AI to sow division ahead of the November elections.

In November 2024, the US Justice Department revealed that the Iranian government had hired a man to survey and kill US President, Donald Trump. An Iranian American journalist, Masih Alinejad was also targeted. The Iranian efforts were described by the Justice Department as &quot;ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. government officials, including Trump, on U.S. soil&quot;. The director of the FBI said Iran was targeting leaders and dissidents who criticized the Iranian government. 

In his first meeting president elect Trump, Joe Biden called Iran the most immediate threat. According to The Wall Street Journal, Iranian regime gave the United States written assurance it would not try to assassinate President Donald Trump.

Elon Musk, head of DOGE, reportedly met with Iran&#x27;s Ambassador to the U.N. and &quot;discussed ways to defuse tensions&quot;. This was officially denied by Iran. AP reported that Iranians were seeking the meeting. 

An Iranian Board of Directors of the Islamic Consultative Assembly member called establishing nuclear deterrent against Trump and Israel essential.

Iran dismissed claims of a secret meeting between Elon Musk and its UN envoy.

== 2025–present: Second Trump administration ==

In February 2025 Trump said he is given United States Military and advisors instructions to obliterate Iran if he is assassinated.

He signed return of Maximum pressure campaign against Iranian regime.

Trump called for talks for Nuclear peace agreement. 
In February 7th prayer Iranian Leader Khamenei dismissed negotiations and warned Iranian government not to make a deal with US. February 9th Trump threatened that he rather Iranians would make a deal than be bombed by Israel.

== Economic relations ==

Trade between Iran and the United States reached $623 million in 2008. According to the United States Census Bureau, American exports to Iran reached $93 million in 2007 and $537 million in 2008. American imports from Iran decreased from $148 million in 2007 to $86 million in 2008. This data does not include trade conducted through third countries to circumvent the trade embargo. It has been reported that the United States Treasury Department has granted nearly 10,000 special licenses to American companies over the past decade to conduct business with Iran.

US exports to Iran include cigarettes (US$73 million); corn (US$68 million); chemical wood pulp, soda or sulfate (US$64 million); soybeans (US$43 million); medical equipment (US$27 million); vitamins (US$18 million); and vegetable seeds (US$12 million). In 2010, US exports to Iran dropped by 50% to $281.8 million.

In May 2013, US President Barack Obama lifted a trade embargo of communications equipment and software to non-government Iranians. In June 2013, the Obama administration expanded its sanctions against Iran, targeting its auto industry and, for the first time, its currency.
According to a 2014 study by the National Iranian American Council, sanctions cost the US over $175 billion in lost trade and 279,000 lost job opportunities.

According to &quot;Business Monitor International&quot;:
On 22 April 2019, under the Trump administration, the U.S. demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases or face economic penalties, announcing that the six-month sanction exemptions for China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey instated a year prior would not be renewed and would end by 1 May. The move was seen as an attempt to completely stifle Iran&#x27;s oil exports. Iran insisted the sanctions were illegal and that it had attached &quot;no value or credibility&quot; to the waivers. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Trump&#x27;s decision not to renew the waivers showed his administration was &quot;dramatically accelerating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our national security objectives while maintaining well supplied global oil markets&quot;. On 30 April, Iran stated it would continue to export oil despite U.S. pressure.

On 8 May 2019, exactly one year after the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the U.S. imposed a new layer of duplicate sanctions on Iran, targeting its metal exports, a sector that generates 10 percent of its export revenue. The move came amid escalating tension in the region and just hours after Iran threatened to start enriching more uranium if it did not get relief from U.S. measures that are crippling its economy. The Trump administration has said the sanctions will only be lifted if Iran fundamentally changes its behavior and character.

On 24 June 2019, following continued escalations in the Strait of Hormuz, President Donald Trump announced new targeted sanctions against Iranian and IRGC leadership, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his office. IRGC targets included Naval commander Alireza Tangsiri, Aerospace commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and Ground commander Mohammad Pakpour, and others. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will block &quot;billions&quot; in assets.

On 8 July 2019, Iran claims to have surpassed the nuclear enrichment level set during the 2015 Iran Deal.

The US Treasury Department Financial Crimes Enforcement Network imposed a measure that further prohibits the US banking system from use by an Iranian bank, thereby requiring US banks to step up due diligence on the accounts in their custody.

The US Department of Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklisted four Iranian metal sector organizations along with their foreign subsidiaries, on 23 July 2020. One German subsidiary and three in the United Arab Emirates – owned and controlled by Iran&#x27;s biggest steel manufacturer, Mobarakeh Steel Company – were also blacklisted by Washington for yielding millions of dollars for Iran&#x27;s aluminum, steel, iron, and copper sectors. The sanctions froze all US assets controlled by the companies in question and further prohibited Americans from associating with them.

On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on 18 Iranian banks. Any American connection to these banks is to be blocked and reported to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and, 45 days after the sanctions take effect, anyone transacting with these banks may &quot;be subject to an enforcement action.&quot; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the goal was to pressure Iran to end nuclear activities and terrorist funding.

On 30 October 2020, it was revealed that the US had &quot;seized Iranian missiles shipped to Yemen&quot;, and it had &quot;sold 1.1 million barrels of previously seized Iranian oil that was bound for Venezuela&quot; in two shipments: the Liberia-flagged &quot;Euroforce&quot; and Singapore-flagged &quot;Maersk Progress&quot;, and sanctioned 11 new Iranian entities.

<doc id="310479" wikidata="Q1025401" url="?curid=310479" title="Scarborough, Ontario">
<text>Scarborough (; 2021 Census 629,941) is a district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is situated in the eastern part of the City of Toronto. Its borders are Victoria Park Avenue to the west, Steeles Avenue and the city of Markham to the north, Rouge River and the city of Pickering to the east, and Lake Ontario to the south. Scarborough was named after the English town of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, inspired by its cliffs.

Scarborough, which was settled by Europeans in the 1790s, has grown from a collection of small rural villages and farms to become fully urbanized with a diverse cultural community. Incorporated in 1850 as a township, the district became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. The borough rapidly developed as a suburb of Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, the city and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the present city of Toronto. The Scarborough Civic Centre – the former city&#x27;s last seat of government – is now used by the municipal government of Toronto.

Since the end of the Second World War, the district has been a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. It includes a number of natural landmarks, including the Toronto Zoo, Rouge Park, and the Scarborough Bluffs. The northeast corner of the district is largely rural with some of Toronto&#x27;s last remaining farms, earning Scarborough its reputation of being greener than any other part of Toronto.

==Etymology==
The area is named after the English town of Scarborough, inspired by Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. The bluffs along the Lake Ontario shores reminded her of the limestone cliffs in Scarborough, England. On August 4, 1793, she wrote in her diary, &quot;The shore is extremely bold, and has the appearance of chalk cliffs, but I believe they are only white sand. They appeared so well that we talked of building a summer residence there and calling it Scarborough.&quot; Before that, the area was named Glasgow, after the Scottish city.

The district has acquired several nicknames. A popular one is &quot;Scarberia&quot;, a portmanteau of Scarborough and Siberia, a reference to its seemingly distant eastern location from downtown Toronto and apparent lack of notable attractions. The word originated sometime in the 1960s and has remained a source of contention ever since. In May 1988, Joyce Trimmer, who was campaigning to be mayor of the city of Scarborough, said, &quot;The city of Scarborough needs strong leadership if it is to shed its &#x27;Scarberia&#x27; image&quot;. With the increased popularity of social media, &quot;ScarbTO&quot; has become a popular online signifier of the community. Scarborough has also acquired nicknames related to its diversity. Such nicknames typically use the prefix &quot;Scar&quot; and a suffix derived from the name of a region, nation, or ethnicity; for instance, &quot;Scompton&quot; or &quot;Scarlem&quot;, alluding to Compton and Harlem respectively.

==History==

The first known evidence of people in the district comes from an archaeological site in Fenwood Heights, which has been dated to 8000 BCE. The site contains the remains of a camp of nomadic hunters and foragers, and there is no evidence of permanent settlers.

In the 17th century, the area was inhabited by the Seneca at the village of Ganatsekwyagon. They were later displaced by the Mississaugas, who were themselves displaced by the European settlers who began to arrive in the late 18th century. After the land was surveyed in 1793, it was opened to settlement by British subjects with the first issue of land patents in 1796, although squatters had already been present for a few years. The first settlers were David and Andrew Thomson. They were stonemasons who worked on the first parliament buildings for York. They each built mills. This activity led to the creation of a small village known as the &quot;Thomson Settlement&quot;. The first post office opened in 1832, in Scarborough Village.

During the early part of life in Upper Canada, local administration and justice was administered by the colonial government. From 1792 to 1841, magistrates were appointed by District Councils. There were four districts in the colony of which Scarborough was part of the &quot;Home District&quot;. Partly due to a political reorganization that was a result of the Durham Report, Scarborough gained elected representation on the Home District Council. Scarborough elected two councillors.

In 1850, the district was incorporated as a township. After incorporation, Scarborough government was led by a reeve, a deputy-reeve and three councillors, each elected annually. Initially the council met in the village of Woburn but it was relocated to Birch Cliff in 1922, where most of the population was then located. During the Great Depression, the local government was on the verge of bankruptcy. The Ontario Municipal Board stepped in and appointed an oversight committee which prevented the collapse of local government.

On April 15, 1953, the township was included within Metropolitan Toronto, a new upper level of municipal government with jurisdiction over regional services such as arterial roads and transit, police, and ambulance services. (Fire fighting services remained separate.) Scarborough retained its local council but gained representation on a new Metro Council. The new council had 24 members, 12 from the old city of Toronto and 12 from the suburban municipalities. The council was not directly elected but was made up of members of each of the local councils. Scarborough&#x27;s contribution was its reeve who at the time was Oliver E. Crockford.

In 1967, the district was incorporated as a borough. The reeve was replaced with a mayor. Albert Campbell, who had been reeve since 1957, became Scarborough&#x27;s first mayor. The new borough&#x27;s council consisted of the mayor and four members of the board of control (which functioned as an executive committee). There were also ten aldermen. The mayor and the controllers also sat on Metro Council. In 1973, the borough increased in size when the West Rouge area, formerly within the Township of Pickering, was transferred to it with the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham. The borough&#x27;s status was changed to city in 1983. The number of aldermen was increased to 14 and the term of office extended to three years from two.

As the urban area continued to expand, much of rural Scarborough was converted to suburban housing developments in the last third of the 20th century. At the start of the 21st century, growth occurred along the Highway 401 corridor at the northern end of the Scarborough RT; highrise condominium projects have increased the residential density around Scarborough City Centre.

In 1988, there was a reorganization. The board of control was abolished. Alderman was changed to councillor. Six additional metro council positions were created and these were elected separately for the first time. Scarborough&#x27;s council consisted of a mayor, 14 local councillors and six Metro councillors.

In 1998, the municipality of Scarborough was dissolved and the district amalgamated with East York, Etobicoke, North York, York, and the old city of Toronto into the current city of Toronto.

==Geography==

The district&#x27;s borders, which correspond to the former city&#x27;s borders, are: Victoria Park Avenue (facing the rest of Toronto) to the west, the Rouge River, the Little Rouge Creek and the Scarborough-Pickering Townline (facing Pickering) to the east, Steeles Avenue (facing Markham) to the north, and Lake Ontario to the south.

Topographically, the district is dominated by two watersheds, Highland Creek and the Rouge River. Highland Creek lies almost entirely within Scarborough and occupies approximately 70% of its total area. It occupies the western half of Scarborough, while the Rouge River flows through the eastern portion. Both of these rivers flow into Lake Ontario. Due to the location of the Lakeshore CN railway right-of-way, both river deltas are constricted to narrow channels where they flow into the lake.

Highland Creek is the most urbanized watershed in Toronto with about 85% of its land use devoted to urban uses. Some sections of the river run through parks and remain in a fairly natural state, while other parts run through industrial or residential districts where the flow is often diverted or channelled. Sections of the creek are marked by deep ravines and valleys, which contain little or no urban development. The deep valley the creek cuts in its bottom sections remains primarily parkland, with little or no development taking place within the valley.

Conversely, the Rouge River valley has parts which are still in a natural, wooded state. The valley is home to a great variety of wildlife including deer, foxes, and the occasional coyote, while the river hosts salmon and catfish. The Rouge River Valley forms a part of Rouge National Urban Park, a national urban park situated along the eastern portion of Scarborough, and its neighbouring municipalities.

Along the shore of Lake Ontario is the earthen escarpment formation known as the Scarborough Bluffs. The Bluffs are about long, and reach heights of more than in places. They are part of a much larger formation known as the &quot;Iroquois Shoreline&quot;, most of which is located somewhat further inland. The Iroquois Shoreline marks the extent of a prehistoric lake, Glacial Lake Iroquois, whose level was quite a bit higher than present-day Lake Ontario&#x27;s. It shrank in size at the close of the last ice age.

Erosion has been a problem along the Scarborough Bluffs. Properties located near the brink have been abandoned, and houses condemned, as the brink wears back away from the lake. Since the 1980s, large areas of beach at the base of the Bluffs have been reinforced with limestone breakwaters and construction rubble infilling.

===Climate===
The district&#x27;s climate is moderate for Canada due to its southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot;), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, due in part to the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.

Climate data is from Buttonville Municipal Airport located southeast.
==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the census districts within the former city had a population of 629,941 living in 218,928 of its 228,939 total private dwellings, a change of −0.3% from its 2016 population of 632,098. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The majority of the district&#x27;s population is between 25 and 64 years old. 52% fell into that &quot;working age&quot; during the last major survey, which also found 21% of Scarborough&#x27;s population was 14 years old or younger, 15% were between 15 and 24, while senior citizens aged 65+ made up the remaining 12%. Like the rest of Canada, the population is aging. It is projected that close to 30% of Scarborough residents will be senior citizens by 2041. Scarborough has a large number of retirement communities, which attracts more seniors to the area creating a situation where the two largest age demographics in Scarborough will be over 55 and under 25.

=== Immigration ===
The vast majority of the district&#x27;s population is composed of immigrants who have arrived in the last five decades, and their descendants. In 2016, 56.6% of residents were foreign-born.

The immigrant population has created vibrant multicultural locales in various areas. One of the more notable among these is the heavy concentration of Chinese businesses and restaurants in the Agincourt neighbourhood. Many of Scarborough&#x27;s main arteries, including segments of Kingston Road, Eglinton Avenue East and Lawrence Avenue East, feature Caribbean, Chinese, African, and Indian restaurants and shops, as well as businesses representing the other ethnic groups in the area. 

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the 2021 census, 477,890 residents identified as members of visible minority groups in Scarborough census tracts, comprising 76.6 percent of the total population of the district. According to the prior census conducted in 2016, the visible minority population numbered 457,775, comprising 73.5 percent of the total population of the district.

The district has one of the largest concentration of Sri Lankan Tamils outside Sri Lanka.

==Crime==

Long-term trends show that the district is less prone to violent crime than the rest of Toronto. Between 1997 and 2006, the proportion of violent crime committed in Scarborough averaged 20.4% despite its making up on average 23.6% of the city&#x27;s total population over that period. Murder rates for the district and the rest of Toronto show no particular divergence. Between 1997 and 2006, the ratio of murders in Scarborough as compared to the rest of Toronto ranged from a low of 8.8% to a high of 32.2%. According to former Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair, &quot;[42 Division is] the safest division in the city&quot;; this division includes north Scarborough. In 2008, the safest part of Toronto was north Scarborough from Victoria Park Ave. to the Pickering border, north of Highway 401.

In 2008, Toronto City Councillors Norm Kelly and Michael Thompson protested that the media was distorting how crime was reported in Scarborough. They noted that whenever a shooting occurred in the rest of the city the location was given as the nearest major intersection, while when a shooting happened in Scarborough the location was given as &#x27;Scarborough&#x27;. According to the councillors, this gave people an erroneous impression of Scarborough as &#x27;crime-ridden&#x27;. They proposed that news outlets sign a &#x27;media protocol&#x27; so that all crime locations were given as intersections. However, the city&#x27;s Executive Committee turned down the request citing this as a form of censorship. Mayor David Miller said &quot;It&#x27;s not city council&#x27;s role to tell the media how to do their job&quot;.

==Economy==


Compared to the City of Toronto as a whole, industry in the district is similar in all labour force categories, save for manufacturing which is higher in the district, and professional, scientific and technical services which are lower. Notable companies that have their headquarters in the district include Toyota Canada, Owens Corning (Toronto), Elizabeth Grant International, Enterprise Holdings, Inc., Thomson Carswell, Bell Media, Teva Canada, Cinram, Royal Doulton, SKF, Amphenol, Dart Canada, Mastermind Toys, Alfa Laval, President&#x27;s Choice Financial, Aviva, Yellow Pages Group, Telus, and Lee Kum Kee Canada. The pizza chains 241 Pizza and Pizza Nova have their headquarters in Scarborough. Amazon opened a new fulfillment centre in north Scarborough in 2020. Large companies that have moved out of Scarborough include: General Motors Canada Van Assembly plant (1993) and Eli Lilly Canada (2019).

A high-density business district has been built up in Scarborough City Centre. Points of interest in the area include Scarborough Town Centre, Albert Campbell Square, Street Eats Market, many surrounding stores, and government and business offices. The area has become one of Toronto&#x27;s secondary business districts outside of Downtown Toronto.

==Notable people==
==Culture==

Most of the district&#x27;s news media has been either weekly or monthly publications. The earliest newspaper was the &quot;Scarborough News and Advertiser&quot; which was published weekly starting in September 1921, which lasted until the 1930s. Other short-lived papers and magazines included &quot;The Enterprise&quot; (1945–1966), &quot;Scarborough Mail&quot; (1946–1955) and &quot;The News&quot; (1952–1996) and &quot;54east magazine&quot; (2005–2009). The last remaining English-language local newspaper was the &quot;Scarborough Mirror&quot;, which started publication in 1962 and was later acquired by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;″s community news division, Metroland. In 2023, it became an online-only publication as part of Toronto.com. A Scarborough edition of the Toronto-wide photography publication &quot;SNAP Scarborough&quot; was launched in 2009. &quot;Ming Pao Daily News&quot; is a Chinese-language newspaper whose headquarters is in the district. They started publication in 1993.

In 1961, the CTV Toronto (CFTO) television channel began operating from the 9 Channel Nine Court studios at the intersection of McCowan Road and Highway 401. Today, the studio also is the headquarters of The Sports Network (TSN). Both companies produce programming at the studio. In 1970, Trillium Cable started to provide cable TV service to Scarborough. It was purchased by Shaw Cable in 1995. During the early days of the company, they produced several local shows for their own cable channel. These shows were produced by volunteers and showed a wide variation in quality. These shows were satirized by Mike Myers in his comedy film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;.

Residents of the district have developed their own unique sense of humour, as evidenced by Myers, whose Wayne&#x27;s World character was inspired by growing up in the area. Other Scarborough natives include Lilly Singh, Eric McCormack (&quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;), John Candy (Second City, &quot;SCTV&quot;), musical group Barenaked Ladies and singer Abel Tesfaye known as the Weeknd. Actor Jim Carrey also lived in Scarborough during his teen years. Scarborough has also been the home of prominent hip hop artists and producers, including Maestro Fresh Wes, Choclair, Boi-1da, Nineteen85, Kardinal Offishall, Saukrates, David Strickland and the group BrassMunk.

According to the list of largest shopping malls in Canada, the Scarborough Town Centre is the fifth-largest in the country and the fourth-largest in the GTA. It is located next to the Scarborough Civic Centre, Albert Campbell Square, and Consilium Place. This area was developed as a city centre for the former City of Scarborough government. The &quot;Scarborough Walk of Fame&quot; is also located in the Town Centre, consisting of plaques embedded in the floor to honour notable residents, past and current. The inaugural inductees included National Basketball Association player Jamaal Magloire, Olympic gold medalist Vicky Sunohara, and eight prominent residents who contributed to advances in medicine, arts, and the community.

In 1974, the Toronto Zoo was moved from its original downtown location to its current location in the Rouge River valley. The new location enabled the zoo to increase its overall area from to over . The zoo was transformed at that time from a 19th-century style zoo with a few animals cramped behind iron bars into a zoo where space was provided to animals and the setting attempted to duplicate the animals&#x27; natural environments.

There are a large number of golf courses in the district, with a mix of public and private courses. Dentonia Park is a public course established in 1967 and is situated in the Taylor-Massey Creek ravine beside the Victoria Park subway station. Formerly a private club, the Tam O&#x27;Shanter Golf Course was established in 1973 as a public course and is located alongside Highland Creek. Private clubs include the Toronto Hunt Club which was the first golf course in Scarborough, established in 1895 alongside Lake Ontario. and the Scarboro Golf and Country Club was established in 1912. The Cedarbrae Golf &amp; Country Club was established in 1922 and moved to its current Rouge River Valley location at Steeles Ave East in 1954.

On May 17, 2006, the &quot;Nike Malvern Sports Complex&quot; was opened in the Malvern neighbourhood. Nike Canada donated to build the complex, which includes a basketball court, a practice soccer pitch, and a running track. The track was constructed from 50,000 used running shoes. The complex was built on the grounds of the St. Mother Teresa Catholic Academy and is open to the public. Olympic hurdler Perdita Felicien was on hand at the opening to encourage youth to participate in sports.
==Education==

Both Agincourt Collegiate Institute and R. H. King Academy claim to be the oldest secondary schools in the district. Agincourt Collegiate Institute (the former Agincourt Continuation School) opened in 1915. It became a high school in 1954. R. H. King Academy opened in 1922 as the &quot;Scarborough High School&quot; being the first high school in the Scarborough area at that time, and became a collegiate in 1930.
Four public school boards operate primary and secondary schools in the district: Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). CSV and TDSB operate as secular public school boards, the former operating French first language institutiona, whereas the latter operates English first language institutions. The other two school boards, CSCM and TCDSB, operate as public separate school boards, the former operating French first-language separate schools, the latter operating English first-language separate schools. , there are 28 secondary schools in Scarborough. 

In addition to primary and secondary schools, two post-secondary institutions are located in Scarborough. The University of Toronto expanded in 1964 and built the University of Toronto Scarborough, which has an enrolment of 10,000 students as of 2006. Centennial College was opened in 1966. It was the first vocational college to open in Ontario. Starting from one campus in Warden Woods, it grew to three campuses across Scarborough (and two others located in East York and North York).

==Governance==

From the incorporation of Scarborough as a township in 1850, the head of the local government was a reeve who chaired the town council. In 1953, Scarborough and twelve other townships, towns, and villages in York County federated with the City of Toronto to form Metropolitan Toronto. Scarborough retained its own town council but an added layer of government, the Metropolitan Toronto Council, with the reeve of Scarborough having a seat. In 1967, Scarborough was incorporated as borough at which point the head of the local government was styled as mayor. A Board of Control, consisting of the mayor and four directly elected Controllers, was also created as an executive committee of Scarborough&#x27;s council, whose members also sat on Metro Council. In 1973, Scarborough opened its new city hall, the Scarborough Civic Centre where the borough and later its city council met. In 1983, Scarborough attained city status, but its governing structure remained the same. In 1988, the Board of Control was abolished.

In 1998, the municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were dissolved and amalgamated into a single City of Toronto. Since then, Scarborough has been a community within the city of Toronto, and the head of the local government is the Mayor of Toronto and is governed by Toronto City Council. Community councils were formed to process issues considered local to their communities. Scarborough&#x27;s community council, made up of the district&#x27;s local councillors, meets once a month at the Civic Centre. The council deals with a variety of local issues such as outdoor patio applications, neighbourhood traffic plans, and exemptions from certain by-laws such as retail signs, fences, trees and ravines. Decisions made by community council are approved by Toronto City Council in order to take effect.

Scarborough is represented by six ridings for the provincial government and Federal government. Municipal riding boundaries were harmonized within the City of Toronto to match the provincial boundaries in 1999 through provincial legislation called &quot;The Fewer Municipal Politicians Act of 1999&quot;. This took effect on December 1, 2000. Ridings were represented by two councillors per riding until 2018 when the Government of Ontario reduced this to one councillor per riding. Scarborough now has six councillors.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms of Scarborough was adopted when the borough became a city on June 29, 1983. A grant of arms was issued by the Canadian Heraldic Authority on February 1, 1996. The coat of arms had a shield within a laurel wreath. Upon this shield were the following elements, in quarters:

* The arms of the province of Ontario
* A sheaf of wheat
* Two cog wheels and a factory
* A view of the Scarborough Bluffs

==Infrastructure==

===Public transit===
The expansion of Toronto in the east, in the 19th century, led to the development of housing stock along the Kingston Road and Danforth Road corridors in Scarborough. This led to the creation of a transit line. In 1893, the Toronto and Scarboro&#x27; Electric Railway, Light and Power Company built a single-track radial line along Kingston Road to Blantyre. Over the next 13 years this was extended to West Hill. In 1904, the line became the &quot;Scarboro Division&quot; of the Toronto and York Radial Railway. Service continued along this line until 1936 when it was replaced by bus service.

Since 1921, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) gradually expanded its public transportation network to Scarborough. Today, it operates bus and rapid transit routes in the district. Line 2 Bloor–Danforth has three subway stations in Scarborough: Victoria Park, Warden, and Kennedy, the current eastern terminus. In 1985, the Government of Ontario opened the Scarborough RT, an above-ground light metro line that operated between Kennedy station at its west and McCowan Road at its east. In 2023, the line shut down permanently due to aging Infrastructure which also caused a derailment earlier that year.

Construction of an extension of Line 2 further east into Scarborough started in June 2021 and is expected to be complete around 2030. The line will be extended 7.8 kilometres from Kennedy station with stations at McCowan Road-Lawrence Avenue, Scarborough Centre, and McCowan Road-Sheppard Avenue. Line 5 Eglinton is a light rail line under construction, which will have its eastern terminus at Kennedy station. The City of Toronto is also proposing another light rail line known as the Eglinton East LRT that is planned to operate from Kennedy station to the University of Toronto Scarborough.

Seven rail stations also provide access to two commuter rail lines operated by GO Transit. The Lakeshore East line runs across the south end of the district with Rouge Hill GO Station, Guildwood GO Station, Eglinton GO Station, and Scarborough GO Station running from east to west. The Stouffville line runs north-south in the west end of Scarborough with Milliken GO Station, Agincourt GO Station, Kennedy GO Station. An eight station on the Stouffville line will be constructed between Milliken and Agincourt stations at Finch–Kennedy GO Station. Other connecting public transportation services with connections to TTC bus routes in Scarborough include Durham Region Transit and York Region Transit.

===Roads and highways===

The district&#x27;s arterial roads are laid out on a grid system of north–south and east–west, corresponding to the concession roads of the original township, laid out to facilitate the establishment of farming communities. Kingston Road and Danforth Avenue were laid out prior to surveying the township, and both run diagonally in a southwest–northeast direction across the south end of Scarborough.

From north to south, the major east–west arterial roads are Steeles Avenue, Finch Avenue, Sheppard Avenue, Ellesmere Road, Lawrence Avenue, Eglinton Avenue and St. Clair Avenue. From west to east, the major north-south arterial roads are Victoria Park Avenue, Pharmacy Avenue, Warden Avenue, Birchmount Road, Kennedy Road, Midland Avenue, Brimley Road, McCowan Road, Bellamy Road North, Markham Road, Scarborough Golf Club Road, Neilson Road, Morningside Avenue, Meadowvale Road and Port Union Road.

Kingston Road was formerly Ontario Highway 2, and was the main highway through the district until the building of Highway 401, which runs east–west across the district, with six to eight lanes in each direction. The short, minor freeway Highway 2A runs parallel to Lake Ontario in the eastern part of Scarborough. 

===Water infrastructure===
Scarborough&#x27;s drinking water is supplied by the R.C. Harris Filtration Plant at the foot of Victoria Park Avenue and the F. J. Horgan Filtration Plant. The F. J. Horgan Filtration Plant was built in 1979 and was formerly known as the &#x27;Easterly Plant&#x27;. Upgrades completed in 2011 allow it to process up to 800 megalitres per day and it will also be the first plant to replace chlorine with ozone as its primary cleansing method. Wastewater for Scarborough is treated at the Highland Creek Treatment Plant. This plant was constructed in 1954 and started processing in 1956. It has undergone continual expansion to meet ongoing demand.

<doc id="310480" wikidata="Q936155" url="?curid=310480" title="Lindelöf space">
<text>In mathematics, a Lindelöf space is a topological space in which every open cover has a countable subcover. The Lindelöf property is a weakening of the more commonly used notion of &quot;compactness&quot;, which requires the existence of a &quot;finite&quot; subcover.

A  is a topological space such that every subspace of it is Lindelöf. Such a space is sometimes called strongly Lindelöf, but confusingly that terminology is sometimes used with an altogether different meaning.
The term &quot;hereditarily Lindelöf&quot; is more common and unambiguous.

Lindelöf spaces are named after the Finnish mathematician Ernst Leonard Lindelöf.

==Properties of Lindelöf spaces==

* Every compact space, and more generally every σ-compact space, is Lindelöf. In particular, every countable space is Lindelöf.
* A Lindelöf space is compact if and only if it is countably compact.
* Every second-countable space is Lindelöf, but not conversely. For example, there are many compact spaces that are not second-countable.
* A metric space is Lindelöf if and only if it is separable, and if and only if it is second-countable.
* Every regular Lindelöf space is normal.
* Every regular Lindelöf space is paracompact.
* A countable union of Lindelöf subspaces of a topological space is Lindelöf.
* Every closed subspace of a Lindelöf space is Lindelöf. Consequently, every Fσ set in a Lindelöf space is Lindelöf.
* Arbitrary subspaces of a Lindelöf space need not be Lindelöf.
* The continuous image of a Lindelöf space is Lindelöf.
* The product of a Lindelöf space and a compact space is Lindelöf.
* The product of a Lindelöf space and a σ-compact space is Lindelöf. This is a corollary to the previous property.
* The product of two Lindelöf spaces need not be Lindelöf. For example, the Sorgenfrey line formula_1 is Lindelöf, but the Sorgenfrey plane formula_2 is not Lindelöf.
* In a Lindelöf space, every locally finite family of nonempty subsets is at most countable.

==Properties of hereditarily Lindelöf spaces==

* A space is hereditarily Lindelöf if and only if every open subspace of it is Lindelöf.
* Hereditarily Lindelöf spaces are closed under taking countable unions, subspaces, and continuous images.
* A regular Lindelöf space is hereditarily Lindelöf if and only if it is perfectly normal.
* Every second-countable space is hereditarily Lindelöf.
* Every countable space is hereditarily Lindelöf.
* Every Suslin space is hereditarily Lindelöf.
* Every Radon measure on a hereditarily Lindelöf space is moderated.

==Example: the Sorgenfrey plane is not Lindelöf==

The product of Lindelöf spaces is not necessarily Lindelöf. The usual example of this is the Sorgenfrey plane formula_3 which is the product of the real line formula_4 under the half-open interval topology with itself. Open sets in the Sorgenfrey plane are unions of half-open rectangles that include the south and west edges and omit the north and east edges, including the northwest, northeast, and southeast corners. The antidiagonal of formula_5 is the set of points formula_6 such that formula_7

Consider the open covering of formula_5 which consists of:

# The set of all rectangles formula_9 where formula_6 is on the antidiagonal.
# The set of all rectangles formula_11 where formula_6 is on the antidiagonal.

The thing to notice here is that each point on the antidiagonal is contained in exactly one set of the covering, so all the (uncountably many) sets of item (2) above are needed.

Another way to see that formula_1 is not Lindelöf is to note that the antidiagonal defines a closed and uncountable discrete subspace of formula_14 This subspace is not Lindelöf, and so the whole space cannot be Lindelöf either (as closed subspaces of Lindelöf spaces are also Lindelöf).

==Generalisation==

The following definition generalises the definitions of compact and Lindelöf: a topological space is formula_15&quot;-compact&quot; (or formula_15&quot;-Lindelöf&quot;), where formula_15 is any cardinal, if every open cover has a subcover of cardinality &quot;strictly&quot; less than formula_15. Compact is then formula_19-compact and Lindelöf is then formula_20-compact.

The &#x27;, or &quot;Lindelöf number&quot; formula_21 is the smallest cardinal formula_15 such that every open cover of the space formula_23 has a subcover of size at most formula_24 In this notation, formula_23 is Lindelöf if formula_26 The Lindelöf number as defined above does not distinguish between compact spaces and Lindelöf non-compact spaces. Some authors gave the name &quot;Lindelöf number&quot; to a different notion: the smallest cardinal formula_15 such that every open cover of the space formula_23 has a subcover of size strictly less than formula_24 In this latter (and less used) sense the Lindelöf number is the smallest cardinal formula_15 such that a topological space formula_23 is formula_15-compact. This notion is sometimes also called the &#x27; of the space formula_33

<text>A patent medicine (sometimes called a proprietary medicine) is a non-prescription medicine or medicinal preparation that is typically protected and advertised by a trademark and trade name, and claimed to be effective against minor disorders and symptoms, as opposed to a prescription drug that could be obtained only through a pharmacist, usually with a doctor&#x27;s prescription, and whose composition was openly disclosed. Many over-the-counter medicines were once ethical drugs obtainable only by prescription, and thus are not patent medicines. 

The ingredients of patent medicines are incompletely disclosed. Antiseptics, analgesics, some sedatives, laxatives, antacids, cold and cough medicines, and various skin preparations are included in the group. 

The safety and effectiveness of patent medicines and their sale is controlled and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and corresponding authorities in other countries.

The term is sometimes still used to describe quack remedies of unproven effectiveness and questionable safety sold especially by peddlers in past centuries, who often also called them elixirs, tonics, or liniments. Current examples of quack remedies are sometimes called nostrums or panaceas, but easier-to-understand terms like scam cure-all, or pseudoscience are more common.

Patent medicines were one of the first major product categories that the advertising industry promoted; patent medicine promoters pioneered many advertising and sales techniques that were later used for other products. Patent medicine advertising often marketed products as being medical panaceas (or at least a treatment for many diseases) and emphasized exotic ingredients and endorsements from purported experts or celebrities, which may or may not have been true. Patent medicine sales were increasingly constricted in the United States in the early 20th century as the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission added ever-increasing regulations to prevent fraud, unintentional poisoning and deceptive advertising. Sellers of liniments, claimed to contain snake oil and falsely promoted as a cure-all, made the &quot;snake oil salesman&quot; a lasting symbol for a charlatan.

== Patent medicines and advertising ==
The phrase &quot;patent medicine&quot; comes from the late 17th century marketing of medical elixirs, when those who found favour with royalty were issued &quot;letters patent&quot; authorising the use of the royal endorsement in advertising. Few if any of the nostrums were actually patented; chemical patents did not come into use in the United States until 1925. Furthermore, patenting one of these remedies would have meant publicly disclosing its ingredients, which most promoters sought to avoid.

Advertisement kept these patent medications in the public eye and gave the belief that no disease was beyond the cure of patent medication. &quot;The medicine man’s key task quickly became not production but sales, the job of persuading ailing citizens to buy his particular brand from among the hundreds offered. Whether unscrupulous or self-deluded, nostrum makers set about this task with cleverness and zeal.&quot;

Instead, the compounders of such nostrums used a primitive version of branding to distinguish their products from the crowd of their competitors. Many extant brands from the era live on today in brands such as Luden&#x27;s cough drops, Lydia E. Pinkham&#x27;s vegetable compound for women, Fletcher&#x27;s Castoria and even Angostura bitters, which was once marketed as a stomachic. Though sold at high prices, many of these products were made from cheap ingredients. Their composition was well known within the pharmacy trade, and druggists manufactured and sold (for a slightly lower price) medicines of almost identical composition. To protect profits, the branded medicine advertisements emphasized brand names, and urged the public to &quot;accept no substitutes&quot;.

At least in the earliest days, the history of patent medicines is coextensive with scientific medicine. Empirical medicine, and the beginning of the application of the scientific method to medicine, began to yield a few orthodoxly acceptable herbal and mineral drugs for the physician&#x27;s arsenal. These few remedies, on the other hand, were inadequate to cover the bewildering variety of diseases and symptoms. Beyond these patches of evidence-based application, people used other methods, such as occultism; the &quot;doctrine of signatures&quot; – essentially, the application of sympathetic magic to pharmacology – held that nature had hidden clues to medically effective drugs in their resemblances to the human body and its parts. This led medical men to hope that, say, walnut shells might be good for skull fractures. Homeopathy, the notion that illness is binary and can be treated by ingredients that cause the same symptoms in healthy people, was another outgrowth of this early era of medicine. Given the state of the pharmacopoeia, and patients&#x27; demands for something to take, physicians began making &quot;blunderbuss&quot; concoctions of various drugs, proven and unproven. These concoctions were the ancestors of the several nostrums.

Touting these nostrums was one of the first major projects of the advertising industry. The marketing of nostrums under implausible claims has a long history. In Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1749), allusion is made to the sale of medical compounds claimed to be universal panaceas:As to Squire Western, he was seldom out of the sick-room, unless when he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle. Nay, he would sometimes retire hither to take his beer, and it was not without difficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his beer too: for no quack ever held his nostrum to be a more general panacea than he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in all the physic in an apothecary&#x27;s shop.
Within the English-speaking world, patent medicines are as old as journalism. &quot;Anderson&#x27;s Pills&quot; were first made in England in the 1630s; the recipe was allegedly learned in Venice by a Scot who claimed to be physician to King Charles I. Daffy&#x27;s Elixir was invented about 1647 and remained popular in Britain and the USA until the late 19th century. The use of &quot;letters patent&quot; to obtain exclusive marketing rights to certain labelled formulas and their marketing fueled the circulation of early newspapers. The use of invented names began early. In 1726 a patent was also granted to the makers of Dr Bateman&#x27;s Pectoral Drops; at least on the documents that survive, there was no Dr. Bateman. This was the enterprise of a Benjamin Okell and a group of promoters who owned a warehouse and a print shop to promote the product.
A number of American institutions owe their existence to the patent medicine industry, most notably a number of the older almanacs, which were originally given away as promotional items by patent medicine manufacturers. Perhaps the most successful industry that grew up out of the business of patent medicine advertisements, though, was founded by William H. Gannett in Maine in 1866. There were few circulating newspapers in Maine in that era, so Gannett founded a periodical, &quot;Comfort&quot;, whose chief purpose was to propose the merits of &quot;Oxien&quot;, a nostrum made from the fruit of the baobab tree, to the rural folks of Maine. Gannett&#x27;s newspaper became the first publication of Guy Gannett Communications, which eventually owned four Maine dailies and several television stations. The family-owned firm is unrelated to the Gannett, which publishes &quot;USA Today&quot;. An early pioneer in the use of advertising to promote patent medicine was New York businessman Benjamin Brandreth, whose &quot;Vegetable Universal Pill&quot; eventually became one of the best-selling patent medicines in the United States. &quot;...A congressional committee in 1849 reported that Brandreth was the nation’s largest proprietary advertiser... Between 1862 and 1863 Brandreth’s average annual gross income surpassed $600,000...&quot; For fifty years Brandreth’s name was a household word in the United States. Indeed, the Brandreth pills were so well known they received mention in Herman Melville&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

Another publicity method – undertaken mostly by smaller firms – was the &quot;medicine show,&quot; a traveling circus of sorts that offered vaudeville-style entertainments on a small scale, and climaxed in a pitch for some sort of cure-all nostrum. &quot;Muscle man&quot; acts were especially popular on these tours, for this enabled the salesman to tout the physical vigour the product supposedly offered. The showmen frequently employed shills, who stepped forward from the crowd to offer &quot;unsolicited&quot; testimonials about the benefits of the medicine. Often, the nostrum was manufactured and bottled in the wagon in which the show travelled. The Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company became one of the largest and most successful medicine show operators. Their shows had an American Indian or Wild West theme, and employed many American Indians as spokespeople such as the Modoc War scout Donald McKay. The &quot;medicine show&quot; lived on in American folklore and Western movies long after they vanished from public life.

==Patent medicines in popular culture==
Patent medicines were often praised or parodied in popular culture. An example is &quot;The Great Wahoo Polka&quot; by J.N. Pattison, a speedy dance jig in praise of a family of products known as &quot;Wahoo Bitters&quot;. The remedy&#x27;s active ingredient was the purgative Euonymus atropurpureus, commonly known as Wahoo.

== Ingredients and their uses ==

===Supposed ingredients===

Many promoters desired to lend their preparations a sense of exoticism and mystery. Unlikely ingredients such as the baobab fruit in &quot;Oxien&quot; were a recurring theme. A famous patent medicine of the period was &quot;Dr. Kilmer&#x27;s Swamp Root&quot;; unspecified roots found in swamps had remarkable effects on the kidneys, according to its literature.

Native American themes were also useful: natives, imagined to be noble savages, were thought to be in tune with nature, and heirs to a body of traditional lore about herbal remedies and natural cures. One example of this approach from the period was &quot;Kickapoo Indian Sagwa&quot;, a product of the Kickapoo Indian Medicine Company of Connecticut (completely unrelated to the real Kickapoo Indian tribe of Oklahoma), supposedly based on a Native American recipe. This nostrum was the inspiration for Al Capp&#x27;s &quot;Kickapoo Joy Juice&quot;, featured in the comic strip, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. Another benefit of claiming traditional native origins was that it was nearly impossible to disprove. A good example of this is the story behind Dr. Morse&#x27;s Indian Root Pills, which was the mainstay of the Comstock patent medicine business. According to text on a wrapper on every box of pills, Dr. Morse was a trained medical doctor who enriched his education by travelling extensively throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe. He supposedly lived among the American Indians for three years, during which time he discovered the healing properties of various plants and roots that he eventually combined into Dr. Morse&#x27;s Indian Root Pills. No one knows if Dr. Morse ever actually existed.

Other promoters took an opposite tack from timeless herbal wisdom. Nearly any scientific discovery or exotic locale could inspire a key ingredient or principle in a patent medicine. Consumers were invited to invoke the power of electromagnetism to heal their ailments. In the nineteenth century, electricity and radio were gee-whiz scientific advances that found their way into patent medicine advertising, especially after Luigi Galvani showed that electricity influenced the muscles. Devices meant to electrify the body were sold; nostrums were compounded that purported to attract electrical energy or make the body more conductive. &quot;Violet ray machines&quot; were sold as rejuvenation devices, and balding men could seek solace in an &quot;electric fez&quot; purported to regrow hair. Albert Abrams was a well known practitioner of electrical quackery, claiming the ability to diagnose and treat diseases over long distances by radio. In 1913 the quack John R. Brinkley, calling himself an &quot;Electro Medic Doctor&quot;, began injecting men with colored water as a virility cure, claiming it was &quot;electric medicine from Germany&quot;. (Brinkley would go on to even greater infamy through transplanting goat testicles into men&#x27;s scrotums as a virility treatment.)

Towards the end of the period, a number of radioactive medicines, containing uranium or radium, were marketed. Some of these actually contained the ingredients promised, and there were a number of tragedies among their devotees. Most notoriously, steel heir Eben McBurney Byers was a supporter of the popular radium water Radithor, developed by the medical con artist William J. A. Bailey. Byers contracted fatal radium poisoning and had to have his jaw removed in an unsuccessful attempt to save him from bone cancer after drinking nearly 1400 bottles of Bailey&#x27;s &quot;radium water&quot;. Water irradiators were sold that promised to infuse water placed within them with radon, which was thought to be healthy at the time.

===Actual ingredients===
Contrary to what is often believed, some patent medicines did, in fact, deliver the promised results, albeit with very dangerous ingredients. For example, medicines advertised as &quot;infant soothers&quot; contained opium, then a legal drug. Those advertised as &quot;catarrh snuff&quot; contained cocaine, also legal. While various herbs, touted or alluded to, were talked up in the advertising, their actual effects often came from procaine extracts or grain alcohol. Those containing opiates were at least effective in relieving pain, coughs, and diarrhea, though they could result in addiction. This hazard was sufficiently well known that many were advertised as causing none of the harmful effects of opium (though many of those so advertised actually did contain opium).

Until the twentieth century, alcohol was the most controversial ingredient, for it was widely recognised that the &quot;medicines&quot; could continue to be sold for their alleged curative properties even in prohibition states and counties. Many of the medicines were in fact liqueurs of various sorts, flavoured with herbs said to have medicinal properties. Some examples include:

*&quot;Cannabis indica&quot;, the low growing variants of cannabis with a high level of THC.
*&quot;Peruna&quot; was a famous &quot;Prohibition tonic&quot;, weighing in at around 18% grain alcohol. A nostrum known as &quot;Jamaican ginger&quot; was ordered to change its formula by Prohibition officials. To fool a chemical test some vendors added a toxic chemical, tricresyl phosphate, an organophosphate compound that produced organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy, a chronic nerve damage syndrome similar to that caused by certain nerve agents. Unwary imbibers suffered a form of paralysis that came to be known as &quot;jake-leg&quot;.
*Clark Stanley, the &quot;Rattlesnake King&quot;, produced Stanley&#x27;s snake oil, publicly processing rattlesnakes at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His liniment, when seized and tested by the federal government in 1917, was found to contain mineral oil, 1% fatty oil, red pepper, turpentine and camphor. This is not too unlike modern capsaicin and camphor liniments.
*The original formulation of Coca-Cola used coca leaves, an indirect source of cocaine, and was marketed as an energy rejuvenator. Unlike most patent medicines of its era, it did not contain alcohol.
*Some herbal preparations included laxatives such as senna or diuretics, to give the compounds some obvious physical effects.

When journalists and physicians began focusing on the narcotic contents of the patent medicines, some of their makers began replacing the opium tincture laudanum with acetanilide, a particularly toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic as well as antipyretic properties that had been introduced into medical practice under the name &quot;Antifebrin&quot; by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886. But this ingredient change probably killed more of the nostrum&#x27;s users than the original narcotics did, since acetanilide not only alarmingly caused cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, but was later discovered to cause liver and kidney damage.

The occasional reports of acetanilide-induced cyanosis prompted the search for less toxic aniline derivatives. Phenacetin was one such derivative; it was eventually withdrawn after it was found to be a carcinogen. After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was ultimately established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (known in the United States as USAN: acetaminophen) in the human body, and that it was this metabolite that was responsible for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. Acetanilide is no longer used as a drug in its own right, although the success of its metabolite – paracetamol (acetaminophen) – is well known.

===Supposed uses===
Patent medicines were supposedly able to cure just about everything. Nostrums were openly sold that claimed to cure or prevent venereal diseases, tuberculosis, and cancer. &quot;Bonnore&#x27;s Electro Magnetic Bathing Fluid&quot; claimed to cure cholera, neuralgia, epilepsy, scarlet fever, necrosis, mercurial eruptions, paralysis, hip diseases, chronic abscesses, and &quot;female complaints&quot;. William Radam&#x27;s Microbe Killer, a product sold widely on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1890s and early 1900s, had the bold claim &#x27;Cures All Diseases&#x27; prominently embossed on the front of the bottle. Ebeneezer Sibly (&#x27;Dr Sibly&#x27;) in late 18th and early 19th century Britain went so far as to advertise that his Solar Tincture was able to &quot;restore life in the event of sudden death&quot;, amongst other marvels.

Every manufacturer published long lists of testimonials that described their product curing all sorts of human ailments. Fortunately for both makers and users, the illnesses they claimed were cured were almost invariably self-diagnosed – and the claims of the writers to have been healed of cancer or tuberculosis by the nostrum should be considered in this light.

== The end of the patent medicine era ==

Muckraker journalists and other investigators began to publicize instances of death, drug addiction, and other hazards from the compounds. This took no small courage by the publishing industry that circulated these claims, since the typical newspaper of the period relied heavily on the patent medicines. In 1905, Samuel Hopkins Adams published an exposé entitled &quot;The Great American Fraud&quot; in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; that led to the passage of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. This statute did not ban the alcohol, narcotics, and stimulants in the medicines; it required them to be labeled as such, and curbed some of the more misleading, overstated, or fraudulent claims that appeared on the labels. In 1936 the statute was revised to ban them, and the United States entered a long period of ever more drastic reductions in the medications available unmediated by physicians and prescriptions. Morris Fishbein, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, who was active in the first half of the 20th century, based much of his career on exposing quacks and driving them out of business.

In more recent years, also, various herbal concoctions have been marketed as &quot;nutritional supplements&quot;. While their advertisements are careful not to cross the line into making explicit medical claims, and often bear a disclaimer that asserts that the products have not been tested and are not intended to diagnose or treat any disease, they are nevertheless marketed as remedies of various sorts. Weight loss &quot;while you sleep&quot; and similar claims are frequently found on these compounds (cf., Calorad, Relacore, etc.). Despite the ban on such claims, salesmen still occasionally (and illegally) make such claims; Jim Bakker, a disgraced televangelist, sells a colloidal silver gel that he claims will cure all venereal diseases and SARS-related coronaviruses. One of the most notorious such elixirs, however, calls itself &quot;Enzyte&quot;, widely advertised for &quot;natural male enhancement&quot; – that is, penis enlargement. Despite being a compound of herbs, minerals, and vitamins, Enzyte formerly promoted itself under a fake scientific name &quot;Suffragium asotas&quot;. Enzyte&#x27;s makers translate this phrase as &quot;better sex&quot;, but it is in fact ungrammatical Latin for &quot;refuge for the dissipated&quot;.

==Surviving consumer products from the patent medicine era==
A number of brands of consumer products that date from the patent medicine era are still on the market and available today. Their ingredients may have changed from the original formulas; the claims made for the benefits they offer have typically been seriously revised, but in general at least some of them have genuine medical uses. These brands include:

*Absorbine Jr.
*Anacin/Anadin
*Andrews Liver Salts
*Aspro aspirin tablets
*BC Powder
*Bromo-Seltzer
*Carter&#x27;s Little Liver Pills (currently sold as Carter&#x27;s Little Pills)
*Chlorodyne
*Doan&#x27;s Pills
*Fletcher&#x27;s Castoria
*Geritol
*Goody&#x27;s Powder
*Dr. J.H. McLean&#x27;s Volcanic Oil
*Lobeila Cough Syrup
*Lorman’s Indian Oil
*Luden&#x27;s Throat Drops
*Lydia E. Pinkham&#x27;s Vegetable Compound
*Minard&#x27;s Liniment
*Phillips&#x27; Milk of Magnesia
*Smith Brothers Throat Drops
*Vicks VapoRub

A number of patent medicines are produced in China. Among the best known of these is Shou Wu Chih, a black, alcoholic liquid that the makers claimed turned gray hair black.

===Products no longer sold under medicinal claims===
Some consumer products were once marketed as patent medicines, but have been repurposed and are no longer sold for medicinal purposes. Their original ingredients may have been changed to remove drugs, as was done with Coca-Cola.

<text>America&#x27;s Most Wanted (often abbreviated as AMW) is an American television program whose first run was produced by 20th Television, and second run is under the Fox Alternative Entertainment division of Fox Corporation. At the time of its cancellation by the Fox television network in June 2011, it was the longest-running program in the network&#x27;s history (24 seasons), a mark since surpassed by &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, although the program was revived ten years later. The show started off as a half-hour program on February 7, 1988. In 1990, the show&#x27;s format was changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The show&#x27;s format was reverted to 30 minutes in 1995, and then back to 60 minutes in 1996. A short-lived syndicated spinoff titled &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted: Final Justice&quot; aired during the 1995–96 season.

The September following the initial 2011 cancellation, the show&#x27;s host, John Walsh, announced that it would resume later that year on the cable network Lifetime, where it ran until its March 28, 2013, cancellation. This was reportedly due to low ratings and the level of royalty payments to Fox which holds the trademark and copyright. It was succeeded by &quot;John Walsh Investigates&quot;, a one-off special on Lifetime.

The show featured reenactments of dangerous fugitives that are portrayed by actors, interspersed with on-camera interviews, with Walsh in a voiceover narration. Each episode also featured photographs of dangerous fugitives, as well as a toll-free hotline number where viewers could give information at 1-800-CRIME-TV (1-800-274-6388), and they were allowed to remain anonymous. On May 2, 2008, the program&#x27;s website announced its 1,000th capture. Many of the series&#x27; cases have some connection outside the United States or have not taken place in the United States at all. The series&#x27; first international capture was in Nova Scotia in 1989. With Walsh at the helm, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; began to broaden its scope. In addition to the regular segments narrated by Walsh, the show expanded its segments and correspondents.

The first two-hour quarterly special aired on Saturday, October 29, 2011, on Fox. The second two-hour special aired on Saturday, December 17, 2011, the third two-hour special aired on Saturday, February 11, 2012, and the fourth and final two-hour special aired on Saturday, April 21, 2012.

On July 13, 2014, a successor premiered on CNN called &quot;The Hunt with John Walsh&quot;, which added more international stories to its predecessor. The series ran until the end of its fourth season on November 19, 2017. From 2019 to 2022, Walsh hosted the Investigation Discovery series &quot;In Pursuit with John Walsh&quot;.

In January 2020, Fox announced plans to revive &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. The revival premiered on March 15, 2021, and was hosted by Elizabeth Vargas. In November 2023, Fox announced a second season. The next month, it was announced that Walsh was returning as host, along with his son Callahan. The second season premiered on January 22, 2024.

==History==
===Conception and early airing===

The concept for &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; originally came from a German show, &quot;Aktenzeichen XY… ungelöst&quot; (German for &quot;File Reference XY ... Unsolved&quot;), that first aired in 1967, and the British show &quot;Crimewatch&quot;, first aired in 1984, with the US version conceived by Fox executive Stephen Chao and Executive Producer Michael Linder in the summer of 1987. Even earlier, however, CBS aired a three-month half-hour similar series hosted by Walter McGraw in the 1955–1956 season titled &quot;Wanted&quot;.
While Linder was shooting the pilot episode in Indiana, Chao and Fox attorney Tom Herwitz conducted a hurried search for a host. Chao&#x27;s first choice was former police officer and best-selling author Joseph Wambaugh, but Wambaugh refused, saying he did not believe a national dragnet would work in the United States. Chao also considered asking then-recently resigned U.S. Attorney (and future New York City mayor) Rudolph Giuliani, former Virginia governor Chuck Robb and former Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey before deciding a politician might use the show as a platform for personal political ambitions. Other potential candidates included former Marine Corps Commandant General P. X. Kelly, journalists Linda Ellerbee and Bob Woodward, and victims&#x27; advocate Theresa Saldana. Then, during a marathon telephone conference call, Herwitz suggested John Walsh. Walsh had gained publicity after his six-year-old son, Adam, was kidnapped and murdered in 1981. The crime had been the subject of the 1983 television film &quot;Adam&quot;, and Walsh&#x27;s later advocacy had resulted in new legislation to protect missing children, as well as the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. After lengthy discussions, Walsh agreed to host the pilot episode.

&quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; debuted as a half-hour program on February 7, 1988, on the then-seven Fox owned and operated stations, located in New York; Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Houston; Chicago; Dallas; and Boston. Within four days of the first broadcast, FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive David James Roberts was captured as a direct result. He was a convicted killer who had recently escaped from prison by digging his way out with a small axe. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the show&#x27;s &quot;Watch Television, Catch Criminals&quot; premise to skeptical law enforcement agencies. Ten weeks later, the program premiered nationwide on the Fox network and became the fledgling network&#x27;s first hit series. In 1990, the show&#x27;s format was changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The show was cut back to 30 minutes in 1995, and back to 60 minutes in 1996. In 1994, an international version of the series aired on various international markets under the title &quot;Manhunter&quot;. From 1995 to 1996, a short-lived syndicated spinoff titled &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted: Final Justice&quot; aired.

The announcer heard on the show from 2004 until his death in 2008 was well-known voice-over artist Don LaFontaine. The first new episode aired after his death was dedicated to him. He was replaced by voice actor Wes Johnson, who served in the role until end of the show&#x27;s run.

Notable writers have included Peter Koper and Greg Scott.

===Logos===
The show&#x27;s first logo ran from 1988 to 1990, which consisted of an eagle sitting on a tree branch in a circle, with lines, stars, and zigzags below, and it has &quot;AMERICA&#x27;S MOST WANTED&quot; written on it. The show&#x27;s second and final logo ran from 1990 to 2012, which would be used for the rest of the show&#x27;s run. In 1996, the show was retitled &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted: America Fights Back&quot;, which ran until 2003. The 2021 logo utilizes the popular motif of utilizing the Stars and Stripes of the American flag as the &quot;E&quot; in &quot;America&#x27;s&quot;.

=== 1996 cancellation and revival ===
The program was canceled for a month and a half in the fall of 1996, per a decision made the previous spring in the wake of high production costs. In its place, Fox moved &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (then entering what soon became its final season) to 9/8c, with the new sitcom &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; following it at 9:30. &quot;Cops&quot; remained in its hour-long 8/7c block. However, protests from the public, law enforcement, and government officials, including the governors of 37 states, encouraged Fox to bring the show back, though low ratings for &quot;Married...&quot; and &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; ultimately sealed the return of &quot;AMW&quot;. &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; was canceled, and &quot;Married...&quot; was moved back to Sundays. On November 9, 1996, the show was retitled &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted: America Fights Back&quot;, which ran until 2003. The change was overseen by Fox executive Peter Roth, who promised to bring the show back. For the next 15 years afterward, the &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;/&quot;COPS&quot; combination made Saturday evening Fox&#x27;s most stable night, along with the longest unchanged primetime schedule on U.S. television as of 2011.

On March 6, 2010, Fox aired the 1,000th episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, and Walsh interviewed then President Barack Obama at the White House. In the interview, they discussed the Obama Administration&#x27;s crime-fighting initiatives, as well as the impact the show has had on law enforcement and crime prevention.

===Covering criminals in the War on Terrorism===
The show expanded its focus so it could also cover criminals in the War on Terrorism when, on October 12, 2001, an episode which featured 22 most-wanted al-Qaeda operatives was aired. The show was put together due to a request by White House aides after the same list of men had been released to the nation two days earlier. However, the first show that focused mainly on terrorism aired after the September 11 attacks and was two hours long.

===From Fox to Lifetime===
On May 16, 2011, Fox Entertainment President Kevin Reilly announced that after 23 years, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, in its weekly format, would be canceled. The final weekly episode aired on June 18, 2011, though Reilly said four two-hour specials would air on Fox in the fall 2011 television season. However, Walsh said he was looking to other networks to keep the show going, saying he had &quot;many, many offers&quot; from other networks. Fox News Channel confirmed that its chairman Roger Ailes had been in preliminary discussions with Walsh about bringing the show to Fox News, but said &quot;nothing has been decided.&quot; On the final Fox episode, Walsh promised to continue the show elsewhere and told the &quot;Associated Press&quot;: &quot;I want to catch bad guys and find missing children—and we&#x27;re not done.&quot;

During the 2010–2011 season, the show averaged an audience of five million. Within hours of Fox&#x27;s announcement of the show&#x27;s cancellation, campaigns to save the show were started by fans through Facebook and Twitter, among other social networking sites.

In September 2011, it was announced that Lifetime had picked up &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; from Fox and it began airing on the former on December 2, 2011. On March 13, 2012, Lifetime ordered an additional 20 episodes. However, on March 28, 2013, it was announced that Lifetime had cancelled &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;.

=== 2021 revival ===
In January 2021, Fox announced that it would revive &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, with a new host Elizabeth Vargas, with the full endorsement of John Walsh, who could appear if contractual requirements with Discovery for his series &quot;In Pursuit&quot; are relaxed. The revival premiered on March 15, 2021, and included augmented reality components to show a person&#x27;s profile in full, including a full-body render of suspects or missing children, as they were last seen or artificially aged, along with identifying features such as scars and tattoos. The toll-free number for tips changed to 833-3AMWTIP (833-326-9847) and the website changed to AMWTips.com, as opposed to AMW.com; though the latter domain has remained under Fox&#x27;s control since 1997. Tipsters&#x27; identities were anonymous and, as always, were eligible for a cash reward for information leading to the apprehension of criminal(s) involved. An extension series hosted by Nancy Grace, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted Overtime&quot;, was also carried on the Fox Nation streaming service.

It was announced in December 2023 that John Walsh would return as host of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted,&quot; with his son Callahan Walsh serving as co-host.

The second season premiered on January 22, 2024 to 2.16 million viewers. Elizabeth Smart, whose 2002 kidnapping was broadcast on the original show, appeared as a guest to discuss child abduction.

==&quot;AMW&quot; Dirty Dozen==
The &quot;AMW&quot; Dirty Dozen was John Walsh&#x27;s list of notorious fugitives who had been profiled on the show who were at that time, still at large. It was similar in function, though not identical with, the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list; four of the Dirty Dozen were on the FBI&#x27;s list.

These are the Dirty Dozen, as of January 8, 2013. Currently, there are 8 fugitives still wanted despite the idea of the list being John Walsh&#x27;s 12 personal most wanted. The eleventh, Andre Neverson was arrested in 2018. Paul Jackson was arrested in 2015. Resort killer Beacher Ferrel Hackney was removed after his body was discovered in September 2012. Alleged murderer William Joseph Greer has also been removed from Walsh&#x27;s Dirty Dozen before despite him seemingly still on the run.

* Jason Derek Brown is wanted for the murder of an armored car driver and robbery of $56,000 in front of a movie theater in Phoenix, Arizona, on November 29, 2004. He is charged in Phoenix with first-degree murder and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He is believed to be in either British Columbia, or Mexico. On December 8, 2007, Brown was added to the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted List. On September 7, 2022, he was removed from the Ten Most Wanted list without being captured, but he is still wanted.
* Jose Fernando Corona is wanted out of Lewisville, TX for brutally murdering his wife with a chainsaw on April 26, 2010. The murder has shaken the quiet community to the core, particularly his daughter with whom he was close. Despite no criminal record, the otherwise mild-mannered father of six had a nervous breakdown and carried out this grisly act that was considered atypical of his character. Corona has since been on the run from the law, possibly being hidden by friends.
* Berny Figueroa is wanted for the murder of two-year-old Alexia Lopez in Brenham, Texas. On March 11, 2008, Figueroa punched Lopez in the stomach, separating her large and small intestines at the daycare facility where she worked.
* Robert Fisher is wanted for the murder of his wife, Mary, and his children, Brittany and Bobby Jr. in Scottsdale, Arizona, on April 10, 2001, and then burning down their house to try to cover up the crime. He was also on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted List (until his removal in November 2021) and is considered to be AMW&#x27;s Public Enemy Number 1.
* Alexis Flores is wanted for the kidnapping and murder of five-year-old Iriana DeJesus in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in July 2000. The DNA Match returned in March 2007. Flores was also placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on June 2, 2007.
* Francisco Javier Lopez Gonzalez is wanted for the murder of his step son.
* Elby Hars was wanted for sexually abusing young girls in Columbia, South Carolina. He had previously served time for sexually abusing his own daughter, Terri Hars. When he was released, he found young girls to abuse, leading to him going to prison. 
* Daniel Hiers is wanted for the murder of his wife, Ludimila Hiers, in Goose Creek, South Carolina, in March 2005. He is also wanted for sexually abusing a child in Charleston, South Carolina, shortly before. Hiers, a former police officer, is on the U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted List, and they are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Hiers was arrested in 2018 in Shanghai, China after being on the run for 13 years.
*Paul Erven Jackson and sibling Vance Roberts were believed by police to have lured teenage girls to a homemade sex-torture chamber they built in the residence they once shared in Hillsboro, Oregon. While Roberts turned himself in and was sentenced to 108 years in prison, Jackson escaped in June 1990 and was on the run until September 2015. On September 28, 2015, he was arrested by immigration officials in Guadalajara, Mexico, where Jackson appeared to have been living for years using an alias. He was transported back to the U.S. and is currently awaiting trial on kidnapping charges in Hillsboro.
* Andre Neverson is wanted for the murders of his sister, Patricia Neverson, and his ex-girlfriend, Donna Davis, both in Brooklyn, New York, in July 2002. He is also on the U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted list. Neverson was captured on September 4, 2018.
* Yaser Abdel Said was wanted for shooting his two teenage daughters to death in an &quot;honor killing&quot; on January 1, 2008, in Irving, Texas. He was also wanted for questioning in the girls&#x27; sexual abuse nearly a decade prior. He was added to the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted List on December 4, 2014. On August 26, 2020, Said was captured in Justin, Texas.

==Presumption of innocence==
Given that a significant number of the fugitives on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; had yet to face trial in a criminal court, the show adhered to the presumption of innocence as afforded under the law. For this reason, in the cases where fugitives had not yet been convicted, John Walsh would always precede his narrative of the crime with either the terms &quot;Police say...&quot;, &quot;According to police...&quot;, or other such similar terms followed by a description of the crime to which the person had allegedly committed.

In a handful of rare cases, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; profiled persons who were involved in controversial cases or who had fled to avoid prosecution on what they believed to be unfair or even framed charges. One female fugitive, who had fled to Canada, later had charges against her dismissed even after being profiled on the show. In another case, a judge ordered a change of venue for a suspected child murderer after learning that nearly the entire county had seen the suspect profiled on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and believed him guilty. During its entire run, Walsh refused to ever issue a retraction, and never updated viewers on any fugitives who were later found not guilty of the crimes to which they had been profiled.

==In popular culture==

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 1 finale &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; featured a parody of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; called &quot;America&#x27;s Most Armed and Dangerous&quot;, which featured a profile of Ms. Botz (real name: Lucille Botzcowski), the Simpson&#x27;s babysitter, who is nicknamed the Babysitter Bandit. In season six of &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; John Walsh appeared as the host of &quot;Springfield&#x27;s Most Wanted,&quot; a fictitious version of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; which was designed to serve as a lead-in to the resolution to the &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot; cliffhanger from the end of season six. It was also referenced during the episode Lisa&#x27;s Rival, in which the name of the character Millhouse van Houten is mentioned because he is going to be featured on the show. This event is reinforced by armed men who chase him multiple times in the episode.

In season six of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, the fictitious mobster The Cheese Man boasts that his most recent appearance on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; was the highest-rated episode ever.

In the 2019 science fiction action film &quot;&quot;, Sarah Connor reveals that she was featured in an entire episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and is wanted in fifty American states, due to escaping Pescadero State Hospital, destroying Cyberdyne Systems and allegedly killing Miles Dyson 25 years earlier.

In an episode of the sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot;, Liz Lemon mentions that she once appeared on America&#x27;s Most Wanted, playing a woman who was strangled on the toilet.

== Buildings on campus ==

=== The Flint Center for the Performing Arts ===
The Flint Center is De Anza&#x27;s main theater, seating about 2,400 people, and hosts concerts, Broadway shows, dance and speaking events. Each year, De Anza invites several celebrities and dignitaries for public speaking engagements. Construction began in 1968 and the building was dedicated in 1971 as the Calvin C. Flint Center for the Performing Arts, named after the District Superintendent and first Chancellor, The Flint Center also has classrooms and was home to the Film and TV department in its early years.

Steve Jobs introduced the original Macintosh in a January 1984 press conference in the center (which was recreated in 2015 for the movie &quot;Steve Jobs&quot;) and the iMac in 1998. In January 1985, Jobs came back to Flint Center to introduce the LaserWriter laser printer and its built-in PostScript technology, which launched the desktop publishing revolution of the 1980s. 
The Foothill DeAnza Board has voted to close the Flint Center and tear it down. The last event in the facility was June 22, 2019.

=== Euphrat Museum of Art ===
The mission of the Euphrat Museum of Art is to stimulate creativity and an interest in art among audiences of all ages.

Hank Baum wrote in the &quot;California Art Review&quot;:Rita Felciano noted in her review of the 1987 &quot;The Power of Cloth,&quot;&quot;The Euphrat... puts together exhibits from the outside—events that usually have some bite to them.&quot;

In the 1990 &quot;Art around the Bay: a guide to art galleries and museums in the San Francisco Bay Area&quot;, Paul Monaco and Murwani Davis wrote:


=== California History Center in Le Petit Trianon ===
The college is the home of the California History Center, housed in a mansion called &quot;Le Petit Trianon&quot;.

=== Visual and Performing Arts Center ===
The Visual and Performing Arts Center opened on March 6, 2009 and was built with an art exhibit and also a 400-seat performance and lecture hall that can be rented by De Anza College organizations and outside community groups.

=== Kirsch Center ===
The Kirsch Center opened in 2005 and was the first community college building in the US to receive a LEED platinum rating.

A 17-year effort, the Kirsch Center was conceived and is operated by De Anza faculty, staff and students.

Over 100 environmental classes are taught in the Kirsch Center. In addition to classrooms and labs, students can work in self-paced programs at special open study stations throughout the building.

A few examples of what the building features are:
* Solar panel roof
* Advanced natural ventilation
* Raised floor for gentle air distribution and flexibility
* Natural day lighting
* Orientation and layout for energy efficiency and passive solar benefits
* Water conservation and water runoff control
* Radiant heating and cooling
* Native species landscaping

The building is a favorite location for policy makers, school officials, student groups, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to visit and utilize for conferences and for tours.

The building was a 10 million dollar project that was funded by various groups including the student senate, Morgan Family Foundation, and Steve and Michele Kirsch Foundation.

=== Fujitsu Planetarium ===
The Fujitsu Planetarium, with its 50-foot dome and seating for 139, teaches De Anza students, field trip groups, and the public. It also includes an evening musical laser light show on its Saturday public schedule from September to April. Its optical-mechanical projector was installed in 2007, and the new digital projection system was installed in 2016. The planetarium was built in the early 1970s and was named the Minolta Planetarium until 2008.

=== Outdoor artwork ===
* &quot;La Vita E Una Fontana&quot; or &quot;Life is a Fountain&quot; by Salvatore Pecoraro December 1, 1991
* &quot;Longevity Turtle&quot; by Elwood Martin Reynolds, donated by Dr. and Mrs. Alvin Rutner
* &quot;Time Graffiti&quot; by David Middlebrook, 1997. donated by Mrs. Rena Frabony DeHart in memory of De Anza College Founding President A. Robert DeHart.

=== Cheeseman Environmental Study Area ===
This is a natural garden containing some 400 species of plants representing 12 California natural communities. It is located next to the Kirsch Center on the southeast corner of campus, and it was built by a group of De Anza students and faculty in 1971, after having received a US$12,000 grant.

The 12 plant communities are:

* Freshwater marsh and pond
* Coastal sand dunes
* Coastal redwoods
* Foothill woodland
* Grassland
* Conifers
* Channel islands
* California desert
* Coastal sage scrub
* Chaparral
* Riparian
* Xeric display

Students and visitors can learn about California&#x27;s natural heritage and see plants and animals in person. Students can also conduct environmental research here and deepen their appreciation for California&#x27;s biological richness.

== De Anza Associated Student Body ==
The association is required by law to &quot;encourage students to participate in the governance of the college&quot;. It participates in meetings sponsored by a statewide community college student organization named Student Senate for California Community Colleges. The statewide Student Senate is authorized by law &quot;to advocate before the Legislature and other state and local governmental entities&quot;.

=== De Anza Flea Market ===
The student body association also operates The De Anza Flea Market held on every first Saturday of a month. The flea market began as a small effort by the students of De Anza College to raise money for the student body over 30 years ago and has grown into an established community event attracting vendors and patrons from throughout the state. it is still a student enterprise with the De Anza Associated Student Body paying for all of the expenses and gaining approximately $300,000 annually for a variety of programs, services and events at De Anza College. The De Anza Flea Market contains about 825 vendor stalls and usually sells out very quickly. If the weather is good the flea market will draw approximately 15,000 to 20,000 shoppers.

=== New mascot ===
In 2020, De Anza adopted a new mascot after students voted overwhelmingly the previous year to retire the Don, an outdated symbol that many students had never even seen. The Mountain Lion was chosen in December by the college mascot working group, which included DASB student representatives, student-athletes and coaches, after extensive input and campus-wide participation.

== Police and crime ==
De Anza College has its own district police department with armed officers. The department was not a POST participating agency. In 2001, the campus police departments at De Anza and Foothill College were merged to become the Foothill-De Anza College District Police.

=== Averted shooting ===
On January 29, 2001, Kelly Bennett, 18, an employee at a Longs Drugs store in San Jose, was developing photos for Al DeGuzman, 19, a De Anza College student, when she noticed that many of his photos were of guns and bombs as well as of DeGuzman himself posing with said weapons. She called the police, who arrived at the store and waited for DeGuzman. He was arrested when he returned for his photos.

Shortly after DeGuzman&#x27;s arrest, police executed a search warrant on DeGuzman&#x27;s parents&#x27; home in San Jose, where he lived at the time. Inside DeGuzman&#x27;s bedroom, police found bags filled with homemade explosives including Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, as well as numerous guns, including a semi-automatic rifle and a cut-down 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. In addition, plans were discovered for a noon attack at De Anza the next day.

Over 10,000 students and over 1,000 staff were evacuated from De Anza the next day out of fear that DeGuzman had already possibly planted bombs on campus, although none were found. In the following weeks, Bennett was praised and credited with averting a massacre; she appeared on local news, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;the Today Show&quot;.

DeGuzman was initially sentenced to seven years in prison after most of the charges against him were thrown out. However, appeals by prosecutors resulted in a resentencing of 80 years in prison. Several months after his resentencing, DeGuzman died in prison after hanging himself in his cell.

=== Gang Rape investigation ===

In 2007, the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#x27;s Office investigated an inquiry into allegations of gang rape of a 17-year-old unconscious female student, arising from an off-campus party on March 4, 2007, by eight members of the De Anza College baseball team. Several witnesses had allegedly seen the victim and intervened. On June 4, 2007, Santa Clara County District Attorney Dolores Carr announced that no charges would be filed. This decision was questioned, and the Office of the Attorney General was invited by the prosecutor to perform an independent investigation of the available evidence. On May 2, 2008, the attorney general&#x27;s office announced that no charges would be filed.

<doc id="310492" wikidata="Q7183587" url="?curid=310492" title="Phil Gaglardi">
<text>Philip Arthur Gaglardi (January 13, 1913 – September 23, 1995) was a politician in the Canadian province of British Columbia. He served in the provincial Cabinet from 1952 to 1972.

==Private and family life==
Gaglardi was born in Mission, British Columbia as one of eleven children to poor Italian immigrants. In 1938 he married Jennie Sandin, a Pentecostal minister. He attended Bible school and was ordained a Pentecostal minister. In 1944 he moved to Kamloops and became the leader of Calvary Temple (now St. Andrew&#x27;s). He began the radio program &quot;Chapel in the Sky&quot; and his wife began the &quot;Aunt Jennie&quot; broadcast. He continued his weekly 15-minute broadcasts throughout his political career.

The Gaglardis had two sons: Bob Gaglardi, founder of Northland Properties, whose holdings include hotel chains, restaurants and sports teams; and Bill Gaglardi, a Calgary businessman.

==Political career==
Gaglardi was first elected to the legislature in 1952 as the member for Kamloops, under the banner of the Social Credit Party. The party had enough seats to form a minority government, but had no leader. Gaglardi ran for the post, but lost in a vote of caucus members. It was reported that Gaglardi lost to W.A.C. Bennett by ten votes to nine, but according to Bennett&#x27;s biographer, Bennett received ten of the 19 votes and Gaglardi only one. He served in the Cabinet for the full duration of Bennett&#x27;s premiership.

===Minister of Highways===
Gaglardi was appointed Minister of Public Works in Bennett&#x27;s first cabinet, on August 1, 1952. At the same time Bennett created a new Department of Highways and appointed Gaglardi its first Minister. Gaglardi&#x27;s ministry was marked by the rapid expansion of the province&#x27;s paved road system and the completion of most of the major road bridges in British Columbia. Bennett described the building program as &quot;the greatest highway building program per capita in the entire Western world.&quot;

Gaglardi was also given responsibility for BC Ferries and its rapid expansion soon after it was nationalized in 1960. He claimed he &quot;built the whole system around my own impatience.&quot;
Gaglardi convinced a reluctant Premier Bennett to buy the government a Learjet. Bennett had been traveling in a newly inaugurated government-owned ferry to Prince Rupert. To demonstrate that the ferry was too slow for government business, Gaglardi engaged a pilot friend to fly him to Prince Rupert in a Learjet, and got there before Bennett did. Gaglardi waited on the dock to greet the Premier with a purchase contract for the plane. The plane was quickly purchased.

Gaglardi earned the nickname &quot;Flying Phil&quot; from getting speeding tickets when driving in large-engined cars around the province, checking on the progress of road construction, or in his own words &quot;testing the curves.&quot; When pulled over, he would show his pilot&#x27;s license and say, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t driving too fast, I was flying too low.&quot;

In the 1963 election Davie Fulton, who had retired from federal politics to lead the BC Progressive Conservative Party, ran against Gaglardi in his riding of Kamloops. Gaglardi defeated Fulton by several thousand votes, and Fulton soon returned to federal politics.

In 1968 Gaglardi came under fire in the legislature over recurring allegations of preferred highway access to property owned by his sons, use of departmental facilities to provide sign material and construction to benefit their properties, and departmental work performed on his private property. He announced his resignation in March 1968 after revelations of flying his daughter-in-law and grandson on the government jet. Bennett let it be known that Gaglardi had been fired, which was not the case. He continued in Cabinet as minister without portfolio.

===Minister of Social Welfare/Minister of Rehabilitation and Social Improvement===
In 1969 Gaglardi was appointed to the social welfare portfolio, which he renamed the Department of Rehabilitation and Social Improvement. He spoke publicly about &quot;deadbeats&quot;, vowed to become &quot;the roughest, toughest, most effective welfare minister the world has ever known&quot;, and created an agency to assist the indigent in getting jobs.

During the 1972 election, he predicted that Bennett would resign soon after winning the election, accused the premier of being &quot;an old man who doesn&#x27;t understand what is happening with the young people of this province&quot;, described the cabinet as &quot;filled with square pegs in round holes&quot;, and stated, &quot;I&#x27;m the only real choice for the job.&quot; Gaglardi was defeated in Kamloops and the Socreds lost to the New Democratic Party.

===Mayor of Kamloops===
Gaglardi served as mayor of Kamloops from 1988 to 1990. He led a fledgling municipal political party called Team Action whose candidates won a majority of the city council.

==After politics==
After leaving politics he involved himself in the running of his son&#x27;s Sandman Inns. In 1978, he seriously considered running for the leadership of the Social Credit Party of Canada but later withdrew.

Gaglardi Way, a major thoroughfare in Burnaby connecting the Trans-Canada Highway to Simon Fraser University, is named for him.

A statue of Gaglardi was erected in Kamloops. It stands at five feet, four inches.

<text>Nortec (from the combination of &quot;norteño&quot; and &quot;techno&quot;) is a genre of electronic dance music developed in Tijuana (a border city in Baja California, Mexico) that first gained popularity in 2001. Nortec music is characterized by hard dance beats and samples from traditional forms of Mexican music such as &quot;Banda sinaloense&quot; and &quot;Norteño&quot; - unmistakably Mexican horns are often used.

Different individual projects create Nortec music. There is also a &quot;Colectivo Visual&quot;: a group of designers and VJs who take care of the visual side of Nortec live shows. The term Nortec is a conjunction of norteño (&quot;of&quot; or &quot;from the North&quot;) and techno, but mainly describes the collision between the music, style and culture of electronic music with those of norteño and tambora, two music genres indigenous to the North of Mexico. These styles are characterized by their use of accordions and double bass (norteño); tubas, clarinets, horns and pumping bass drums (tambora) and quirky use of percussion and polyrhythmic snare drum rolls (both). All of these elements are used to create a sound that is very Tijuana-like.

Nortec originated in 1999 when Pepe Mogt started by experimenting with samples of old banda sinaloense and norteño albums and altering them on his computer or filtering them with analog synthesizers. He had picked up on the idea by listening to the percussive and angular grooves of the tambora and norteña music played at a family social event. Through some contacts in recording studios located in Tijuana&#x27;s notorious Zona Norte red light district, Pepe compiled tracks of isolated instruments from multitrack recording of tambora and norteño demo recordings that had been abandoned at the studios by the bands that recorded them. He began to burn these tracks onto CD-Rs, which he would later distribute to friends under the condition that they make a new track using the material.

Those first raw tracks were compiled onto the &quot;Nor-tec Sampler&quot;, the first release from Mil Records followed by the release &quot;The Tijuana Sessions Vol. 1&quot; and then &quot;The Tijuana Sessions Vol. 3&quot;.

<text>Dimitri Tsafendas (; 14 January 1918 – 7 October 1999) was a Greek-Mozambican lifelong political militant and the assassin of Prime Minister of South Africa Hendrik Verwoerd. On 6 September 1966, while working as a parliamentary messenger, Tsafendas stabbed Verwoerd – commonly regarded as the architect of apartheid – to death during a sitting of the House of Assembly in Cape Town.

==Early life==
Tsafendas was born in Lourenço Marques (today&#x27;s Maputo) in Mozambique, then a colony of Portugal. His parents were Michalis Tsafandakis (, also spelled &quot;Miguel Tsafandakis&quot;), a Greek marine engineer with anarchist leanings from Kitharida, a small village near Heraklion, Crete, and Amelia Williams, a Mozambican woman of mixed race. He was sent to Egypt when he was three to live with his grandmother and his aunt. He returned to Mozambique four years later; then, at the age of ten, moved to Transvaal, where he attended Middelburg Primary School from 1928 to 1930. He then returned to Mozambique and attended a church school for the next two years.

Tsafendas was familiar with politics from an early age. Several members of his family were Cretan rebels during the Great Cretan Revolution (1866-1869), while his father was a passionate anarchist. At the age of 16, Tsafendas began to work at various jobs, and was dismissed from one of them &quot;owing to his Communist leanings&quot; and after he was suspected of being &quot;engaged in disseminating Communistic propaganda.&quot; When he was 20, the Portuguese security police, PIDE, opened a file on Tsafendas after discovering that he had twice distributed Communist propaganda. In 1939, Tsafendas entered South Africa illegally and joined the South African Communist Party. He became a seaman in the US merchant marine in 1941 and served aboard American ships during World War II. While in the United States, Tsafendas became a member of a religious sect known as the Two by Twos.

In 1947, the US immigration authorities deported Tsafendas to Greece, then in the throes of the Greek Civil War. Tsafendas joined the Democratic Army, the military wing of the Greek Communist Party, and fought with them against the royalists. Shortly before the war ended in defeat for the Communists, Tsafendas made his way to Portugal. Upon his arrival, he was arrested and interrogated by the police about his political activities in Mozambique in 1938. He was imprisoned for nine months in the two most notorious Portuguese prisons for political offenders, the Barca d&#x27;Alva and the Aljube Prison. In October 1951, Tsafendas travelled by sea to Lourenço Marques, but was refused entry because of his past political activities and for being a known Communist, and was deported back to Portugal. Banned from entering South Africa, where his family had gone to live in the late 1930s, and Mozambique, Tsafendas spent the next 12 years of his life in exile. During these years, he applied at least once a year for permission to enter Mozambique or South Africa, but all his applications were refused because of his Communist status and his political activities in Mozambique in the 1930s. Constantly harassed in Portugal by PIDE and the Portuguese police, Tsafendas roamed across Europe and the Middle East, working and visiting places that interested him. During his wanderings, he picked up eight languages. While in Turkey in 1961, he worked for some six months as a teacher of English at the Limasollu Naci College, a prestigious private language institute in Istanbul, and upon eventually securing his return to South Africa, he worked for a time as a translator at Durban Court. In 1962, during a visit to Crete to see his father&#x27;s and ancestors&#x27; birthplace, he met some former World War II Greek partisans who had participated in the kidnapping of German general Heinrich Kreipe. They trained him in bomb-making.

In 1963, Tsafendas was granted amnesty by Portugal after he convinced them that he was a reformed man and no longer a Communist, and he was eventually allowed to return to Mozambique. A year later, Tsafendas was arrested while addressing local people in favour of independence for the colonial territory. In a suitcase containing anti-colonialist and Communist literature, Tsafendas also had several Bibles. He told the police he was not advocating independence but preaching Christianity. The Portuguese were not convinced, and he was charged with &quot;pretending to be a missionary spreading the word about religion&quot; while actually preaching &quot;under the guise of religion in favour of Mozambique&#x27;s independence&quot;. According to PIDE&#x27;s interrogation transcript, &quot;When asked to describe all of the subversive activities that he has been developing against the Country and in favour of Mozambique&#x27;s independence, he answered: That, he hasn&#x27;t been developing any kind of such subversive activities against the Country, neither in favour of Mozambique&#x27;s independence. However, wishes to clarify that he supports, as a Mozambican, the idea of Mozambique&#x27;s independence, governed by the natives of that Province, whether they are black or white.&quot;

The Portuguese were not convinced that Tsafendas was telling the truth, and he was imprisoned. After three months in custody, Tsafendas claimed that he was in fact an apostle, Saint Peter. He was taken to a hospital, where he convinced the Portuguese doctors that he really believed he was Christ&#x27;s foremost apostle and was therefore considered to be insane. He was released from prison custody and soon afterwards released from the hospital.

In 1965, Tsafendas returned to South Africa. Shortly before the assassination, he applied for reclassification from &quot;White&quot; to &quot;Coloured&quot; but his application was turned down.

==The assassination==
In July 1966, at the age of 48, Tsafendas obtained a temporary position as a parliamentary messenger in the House of Assembly in Cape Town. When he first decided to take action against Verwoerd, Tsafendas planned to kidnap the prime minister. However, he soon realised that it would be impossible to do this on his own since his former comrades from the SACP were not keen on participating in anything risky or violent. With the access his new job permitted him, he decided instead to assassinate Verwoerd. He believed that since he had the opportunity to act he was morally obliged to do so, believing as he did that Verwoerd was &quot;the brains behind apartheid&quot; and that without him a change of policy would sooner or later take place. Years later, he told two priests who visited him in the hospital: &quot;Every day, you see a man you know committing a very serious crime for which millions of people suffer. You cannot take him to court or report him to the police because he is the law in the country. Would you remain silent and let him continue with his crime or would you do something to stop him? You are guilty not only when you commit a crime, but also when you do nothing to prevent it when you have the chance.&quot;

Tsafendas&#x27;s initial plan was to shoot Verwoerd, escape in the confusion, hide in the &quot;Eleni&quot;, a Greek tanker that was docked in Cape Town, and then sail away with it to freedom. Ultimately, his plan was to seek refuge in Communist Cuba. However, he had difficulty getting hold of a gun and with time running out and his temporary employment about to expire, he decided to use a knife to kill Verwoerd.

On 6 September, Prime Minister Verwoerd entered the debating chamber of Parliament and made his way to his seat. Tsafendas approached him, drew a concealed sheath knife from his belt, and stabbed Verwoerd about four times in the torso before he was pulled away by other members of parliament. He had made no plan for escape and was easily apprehended. He was taken into police custody, where he was severely beaten, and then moved to a hospital where he was treated for his injuries and interviewed by a psychiatrist. Later, he was returned to jail pending trial.

==Reaction and police investigation==
After the assassination, some leaders in the anti-apartheid movement distanced themselves from any association with Tsafendas. However, others like Johnny Makhatini leader of the ANC in Algiers, hailed the assassination as &quot;the beginning of the end for apartheid&quot; and said it would &quot;help the morale of guerrilla fighters in South Africa (and) increase confusion among whites&quot;. Also in Algiers, Joshua Nkomo, the representative of the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU), said that &quot;the attack ... proved the vulnerability of this fascist empire&quot; and Uazuvara Ewald Katjivena, representative of SWAPO (South West African People&#x27;s Organization), declared that &quot;the fascist Dr. Verwoerd got what he deserved&quot;. Kenya&#x27;s Minister of Defence, Dr. Njoroge Mungai, said when he first heard about the stabbing, &quot;I hope it is successful. It would be a good thing&quot;, and the ruling Kenya African National Union declared that force would be the ultimate method of overthrowing apartheid and characterised the assassination as &quot;a symbolic and heartening act, from which millions suffering from apartheid would draw hope&quot;. People in Nigeria and Uganda danced in the streets with joy when they heard the news of the assassination.

The majority of the African press applauded the assassination. For example, the Algerian-French magazine &quot;Revolution Africaine&quot; applauded the assassination of &quot;the apostle of hatred&quot;, and said, &quot;The most hated man of Africa is no more&quot;, in Ethiopia, a banner headline in the &quot;New Times&quot; of Addis Ababa said, &quot;The Sharpeville butcher stabbed to death&quot;, while Cairo&#x27;s &quot;Al Akhbar&quot; newspaper said Egypt had &quot;no tears to shed&quot; for Dr. Verwoerd.

In contrast, fearing reprisals, Tsafendas&#x27; family and the Greek community in South Africa turned their backs on him.

Throughout his time in custody Tsafendas was subjected to severe torture from beatings, electric shocks, mock hangings and pretended defenestrations. During his interrogation, Tsafendas gave incontestable political reasons for killing Verwoerd: &quot;I did believe that with the disappearance of the South African prime minister a change of policy would take place. I did set myself the task of destroying the prime minister. It was my own idea to kill him. No one offered me any reward for doing so. I did not care about the consequences, for what would happen to me afterwards. I was so disgusted with the racial policy that I went through with my plans to kill the prime minister. ... I wanted to see a government representing all the South African people. I do not think the Nationalist government is representative of the people and I wanted to see a different government&quot;.

At the same time, the Portuguese security police, embarrassed that Tsafendas, a Portuguese citizen with a long history of political activism in Mozambique who had also fooled them into granting him amnesty by pretending he was no longer a communist and or an anti-colonialist, had assassinated Verwoerd, moved quickly to hide their discomfort. Two days after the assassination, the Chief Inspector of PIDE in Lisbon instructed his counterparts in Mozambique not to give the South African authorities &quot;any information indicating Tsafendas as a partisan for the independence of your province [country]&quot;. The PIDE in Mozambique thus lied and misled the South African police as to Tsafendas&#x27;s past political activities.

Despite PIDE&#x27;s efforts, the South African police investigation, led by the notorious General Hendrik van den Bergh, revealed that Tsafendas was a highly intelligent man, well versed in politics, well read, with deep political convictions and a lifelong history of activism who considered Verwoerd to be a dictator and a tyrant. Tsafendas had characterised Dr. Verwoerd as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s best student&quot;, as he believed the South African Prime Minister had copied some of Hitler&#x27;s Nuremberg Laws and applied them to the blacks in his country. Tsafendas had also been banned from entering South Africa due to his political activities and beliefs; the South African security police held four files on him.

A year before the assassination, two people had reported Tsafendas to the South African police as a dangerous Communist, and one of them had even characterised him as &quot;the biggest communist in the Republic of South Africa&quot;. Edward Furness, a South African who had met Tsafendas in London, told the police that Tsafendas closely associated with prominent members of the anti-apartheid movement in London and that he had admitted to him that he wanted &quot;to create a resistance to the regime of South Africa&quot; and that he was willing to do &quot;anything that would get the South African regime out of power&quot;. Evidence was also submitted to the Commission of Enquiry into Verwoerd&#x27;s death that in London, Tsafendas had attempted to &quot;recruit people to take part in an uprising in South Africa.&quot; None of those documents, along with anything that had to do with Tsafendas&#x27;s political ideas and activism, was allowed to see the light of day.

== Trial ==
At his trial, Judge Andrew Beyers declared Tsafendas not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and it was claimed by police and his defence that he had said that he had a giant tapeworm inside him, which affected his life. The court ordered for him to be detained &quot;at the pleasure of the State President&quot;, which meant that only the State President (later President) had the authority to order his release. He was never discharged.

However, the diagnosis of mental illness has since been dismissed by several forensic psychiatrists. Those who examined Tsafendas during the trial based their diagnoses entirely on what Tsafendas told them and had no access to any other information about him: his medical and criminal records and statements by people who knew him. Thus, they formed their opinions after they had each spent four-and-a-half hours with only Tsafendas, took for granted what he told them and had no way of double-checking it.

During the trial, no mention was made of Tsafendas&#x27;s political activism, real political ideas or his motive for killing Verwoerd, as had clearly been expressed by him to the police. The fact that he had given lucid political reasons for killing Verwoerd in his two statements to the police, with no reference to the tapeworm, was concealed at the trial. The Attorney General lied, withheld and manipulated evidence to portray Tsafendas as an apolitical person with schizophrenia who had killed Verwoerd for no political reason. A subsequent Commission of Enquiry into the assassination also withheld and manipulated evidence, which was clearly to portray Tsafendas as he had been presented in court.

== Imprisonment ==
Tsafendas was initially held on Robben Island, then after four months was transferred to Pretoria Central Prison. There he occupied a cell on death row that was specially built for him next to the execution chamber where men were hanged. Tsafendas was subjected to some form of inhuman and cruel torture for most of his imprisonment. In 1989, he was transferred to Zonderwater Prison near Cullinan. In 1994, after the collapse of apartheid, Tsafendas was visited in prison by two Greek Orthodox priests he knew. Tsafendas told them that he killed Verwoerd for being &quot;a dictator and a tyrant who oppressed his people.&quot; Tsafendas said:

&quot;Every day, you see a man you know committing a very serious crime for which millions of people suffer. You cannot take him to court or report him to the police, because he is the law in the country. Would you remain silent and let him continue with his crime, or would you do something to stop him?&quot;

In 1994, he was transferred again, this time to Sterkfontein psychiatric hospital outside Krugersdorp. In 1999, South African filmmaker Liza Key was allowed to conduct two televised interviews with him, for a documentary called &quot;A Question of Madness&quot; in which she raised the suggestion that Tsafendas&#x27;s act was not mindless but politically motivated.

==Death==
Tsafendas died of pneumonia in October 1999, aged 81, 33 years after the assassination. At the time of his death, he was not regarded as a hero in anti-apartheid circles, which sent no members to attend his funeral. The funeral was held according to Greek Orthodox rites, and he was buried in an unmarked grave outside Sterkfontein Hospital. Fewer than ten people attended the service.

== Report to the Minister of Justice regarding Verwoerd&#x27;s assassination ==
On 23 April 2018, a document titled &quot;Report to the Minister of Justice, advocate Tshilio Michael Masutha, in the Matter of Dr Verwoerd&#x27;s Assassination&quot; was submitted to the Minister of Justice of South Africa Michael Masutha by Judge Jody Kollapen. The report was written by Harris Dousemetzis, a tutor at Durham University, England, and consisted of three hardback volumes totalling 2,192 pages and 861,803 words. It was accompanied by a 16GB USB that contained all the evidence gathered by the author for this research, including about 12,000 pages of documents located in the National Archives of South Africa, Portugal and the United Kingdom, 137 interviews, including 69 with people who knew Tsafendas personally, some of them well and even as a child, as well as thousands of newspaper articles.

Dousemetzis collaborated closely in his research and the evaluation of the evidence with Advocate George Bizos, Professor John Dugard, former KwaZulu-Natal state attorney Krish Govender, Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza and former Judge Zak Yacoob, while he also consulted Professor Alban Burke, Head of the Department of Psychology at the University of Johannesburg; Professor Kirk Heilbrun, forensic psychologist and Professor of Psychology at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Professor Phillip Resnick, forensic psychiatrist and Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Forensic Psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio; Professor Robert L. Sadoff, clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Center for Studies in Social-Legal Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and former president of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, as well as of the American Board of Forensic Psychiatry, and Professor Tuviah Zabow, forensic psychiatrist, former head of the forensic psychiatry unit at Valkenberg Hospital and former professor of psychiatry at the University of Cape Town.

The report and the evidence were supported by a joint letter from Bizos, Dugard, Govender, Ntsebeza and Yacoob. They wrote that the new evidence:

The five jurists concluded in their letter that:

Advocate George Bizos characterised the report as &quot;monumental&quot; and described it as &quot;the most comprehensive study of apartheid and how it operated that I have ever seen&quot;. He expressed his belief that the report is &quot;of major historical importance for South Africa and as to our understanding of Verwoerd&#x27;s assassination&quot;. Advocate Bizos described the evidence gathered and presented by the report, proving that Tsafendas was not insane but politically motivated in killing Dr. Verwoerd, as &quot;overwhelming and unquestionable&quot;.

Professor John Dugard stated of the report that it &quot;confirms that there was a cover-up. It shows convincingly that Tsafendas was a political revolutionary, whose assassination of Dr Verwoerd was motivated by a hatred of Dr Verwoerd and all he stood for. He was not an insane killer but a political assassin determined to rid South Africa of the architect of apartheid. Political assassinations seldom achieve their goal and this was no exception. But at least South African history should know the truth about Tsafendas. Dousemetzis has done South Africa a service by correcting the historical record&quot;.

Justice Zak Yacoob said he agreed &quot;100 per cent&quot; with all of the report&#x27;s findings and added: &quot;The historical record shows that comrade Tsafendas killed Verwoerd, that he pleaded insanity at the trial, his plea was upheld and he was, consequent to his plea, confined at the pleasure of the relevant authority. If he had spoken the truth, he would have been sentenced to death, so the tactic was a very good one in the circumstances. History does not record that he pretended to be insane to save his life. This is well brought out in the research. The research shows conclusively that he did a deliberate courageous anti-apartheid act but pretended insanity at the trial; understandably so. I think the research speaks for itself.&quot;

On 24 April 2018, Solly Mapaila, First Deputy General Secretary of the South African Communist Party, made a similar request to the Minister of Justice on behalf of his Party: &quot;We hereby request that the Minister assesses and considers the new evidence, based on research by Mr Harris Dousemetzis, on the assassination of Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd and that the act be classified as politically motivated&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In 1976, Bill Turner wrote and staged in England and South Africa a play simply titled &quot;Tsafendas&quot;. In 1998, Dutch author Henk van Woerden, who visited Tsafendas in hospital towards the end of Tsafendas&#x27;s life, published the award-winning memoir, &quot;A Mouthful of Glass&quot;. An award-winning play entitled &quot;Living in Strange Lands&quot; by Anton Krueger was presented to South African audiences in 2002. A London production entitled &quot;I.D.&quot; was written by the noted Shakespearean actor Antony Sher, who lived in Cape Town at the time of the incident. &quot;I.D.&quot; premiered at the Almeida Theatre in London in 2003, followed by an American debut in 2005.

Tsafendas&#x27;s life story and his assassination of Hendrik Verwoerd are briefly mentioned in the book &quot;The Girl Who Saved the King of Sweden&quot; by Jonas Jonasson, published in 2012.

In November 2018, &quot;The Man Who Killed Apartheid: The Life of Dimitri Tsafendas&quot; by Harris Dousemetzis and Gerry Loughran was published in South Africa. Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha described the book&#x27;s launch as &quot;a moment to celebrate the truth&quot; about Tsafendas.

<doc id="310501" wikidata="Q1230681" url="?curid=310501" title="George Cornewall Lewis">
<text>Sir George Cornewall Lewis, 2nd Baronet, (21 April 180613 April 1863) was a British statesman and man of letters. He is best known for preserving neutrality in 1862 when the British cabinet debated intervention in the American Civil War.

==Early life==

He was born in London, the son of Thomas Frankland Lewis of Harpton Court, Radnorshire and his wife Harriet Cornewall, daughter of the banker and plantation owner Sir George Cornewall, 2nd Baronet and his wife Catherine Cornewall, daughter of Velters Cornewall.

Lewis was educated at Eton College and matriculated in 1824 at Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1828 he earned a first-class in classics and a second-class in mathematics. He then entered the Middle Temple, studying under Barnes Peacock. He was called to the bar in 1831, and briefly from November 1831 went the Oxford circuit. But he shortly gave up on a career in the law, for health reasons. He assisted Connop Thirlwall and Julius Charles Hare in starting &quot;The Philological Museum&quot;, a journal published from 1831 to 1833. Its successor was &quot;The Classical Museum&quot;, which he also supported.

==Commissioner==

Nassau Senior in 1832 recommended Lewis to Henry Brougham as a candidate for the Poor Law Commission then under consideration. At the time there was no outcome. In 1833 Lewis took on his first public role as one of the commissioners to inquire into the condition of poor Irish across the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1834 Lord Althorp included him in the commission to inquire into the state of church property and church affairs in Ireland. In the short-lived &quot;London Review&quot; of 1835–6 edited by John Stuart Mill, a doctrinaire article on the Church of Ireland by Mill himself, influenced by the line of his father James Mill, was followed in the next number by one from Lewis described by Thomas as &quot;highly factual, tolerant, open-minded and practical.&quot;

In 1836, at the request of Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg, Lewis accompanied John and Sarah Austin to Malta. They spent nearly two years reporting on the condition of the island and framing a new code of laws. One main object of both commissioners was to associate the Maltese in the responsible government of the island. On his return to Britain, Lewis succeeded his father as one of the principal poor-law commissioners.

==Government positions==

The enquiry into the Andover workhouse scandal of 1845 damaged the reputation of Lewis, when Edwin Chadwick laid abuses of the Poor Law system at the door of Lewis, his ally Sir Edmund Head, and the cosy relationship they had with Sir James Graham. In 1847 the Poor Law Commission was effectively closed down, under a cloud.

Lewis was then returned as Member of Parliament for Herefordshire, and Lord John Russell appointed him Secretary to the Board of Control. A few months later he became Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs. There he introduced bills for the abolition of turnpike trusts and the management of highways by a mixed county board, and to define and regulate the parochial assessment.

In 1850 Lewis succeeded William Hayter as Financial Secretary to the Treasury. From 1853 to 1854 he sat on Royal Commission on the City of London.

==Editor==

On the dissolution of parliament which followed the resignation of Lord John Russell&#x27;s ministry in 1852, Lewis sought re-election in the 1852 United Kingdom general election. He was defeated for Herefordshire and then for Peterborough. He accepted the editorship of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, and remained in the post until 1855. During this period he served on the Oxford commission, and on the commission to inquire into the government of London.

==Return to government==

In 1855 Lewis succeeded his father in the baronetcy, and was elected member for the Radnor Boroughs, and Lord Palmerston made him Chancellor of the Exchequer. He became responsible for the financing of the Crimean War.

After the change of ministry in 1859 Lewis became Home Secretary under Lord Palmerston, and in 1861, against his wish, he succeeded Sidney Herbert at the War Office. In that role he successfully argued against Russell&#x27;s call for British mediation in the American Civil War in the autumn of 1862. In Cabinet, William Gladstone, Russell and Palmerston favoured the Confederacy. They worried about race war in the United States, and wanted to restore the supply of cotton for the Lancashire textile industry. Lewis opposed, warning of the risks to British interests. His views finally prevailed and the British remained a neutral throughout the Civil War.

==Death==
Lewis fell ill and shortly died, on 13 April 1863, at Harpton Court. He was buried in Old Radnor church on the 17th. Historian Richard Shannon has argued that, had Lewis lived longer, he and not William Ewart Gladstone might have come to lead the Liberal Party. D. A. Smith, writing in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, does not accept that, though saying he would have had a role to play.

==Works==
A major early work by Lewis was &quot;Remarks on the Use and Abuse of some Political Terms&quot; (London, 1832), written under the influence of John Austin. In &quot;Local Disturbances in Ireland, and the Irish Church Question&quot; (London, 1836), he condemned the existing connection between church and state, proposed a state provision for the Catholic clergy, and maintained the necessity of an efficient workhouse organization. It contains a detailed analysis of rural violence in Ireland. The &quot;Essay on the Government of Dependencies&quot; (1841) was a systematic statement and discussion of the relations in which colonies may stand towards the mother country. About 1850, his &quot;Essay on the Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion&quot; was published.

Before leaving college Lewis published observations on Richard Whately&#x27;s doctrine of the predicables. In 1835 he published an &quot;Essay on the Origin and Formation of the Romance Languages&quot; (re-edited in 1862), criticism of François Juste Marie Raynouard&#x27;s theories on Provençal. He also compiled a glossary of provincial words used in Herefordshire and the adjoining counties.

In the 1850s Lewis produced the &quot;Treatise on the Methods of Observation and Reasoning in Politics&quot;, and the &quot;Enquiry into the Credibility of the Early Roman History&quot;, in which he attacked the theory of epic lays and other theories on which Barthold Georg Niebuhr&#x27;s reconstruction of that history was based. In 1859 Lewis published the &quot;Essay on Foreign Jurisdiction and the Extradition of Criminals&quot;, topical after the Orsini affair and the trial of Simon François Bernard. He advocated the extension of extradition treaties, and condemned the idea of &quot;Weltrechtsordnung&quot; which Robert von Mohl of Heidelberg had proposed.

Lewis&#x27;s final works were the &quot;Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients&quot;, in which he applied sceptical analysis to the Egyptology of Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen; and the &quot;Dialogue on the Best Form of Government&quot;, in which, under the name of &quot;Crito&quot;, the author points out that there is no one abstract government which is the best possible for all times and places.

He translated Philipp August Böckh&#x27;s &quot;Public Economy of Athens&quot; and Muller&#x27;s &quot;History of Greek Literature&quot;, and he assisted Henry Tufnell in the translation of Müller&#x27;s &quot;Dorians&quot;. While his friend Abraham Hayward ran the &quot;Law Magazine&quot;, he wrote in it frequently on subjects including secondary punishments and the penitentiary system.

In 1846 Lewis edited a text of the &quot;Fables&quot; of Babrius. This venture into scholarship soured when he advised the British Museum on a purchase of manuscript copies by Konstantinos Minas (also known as Constantin Minadi, or Minoïde Mynas). When Lewis published in 1859 further fables, there was an outcry across Europe that he had validated what were forgeries. This (?) is no longer the accepted view.

==Associations==
Lewis&#x27;s large circle of friends included Edmund Walker Head, George and Harriet Grote, the Austins, Lord Stanhope, John Stuart Mill, Henry Hart Milman, and the Duff Gordons. In public life he was described by Lord Aberdeen as notable &quot;for candour, moderation, love of truth&quot;. According to Geoffrey Madan, although invited by Queen Victoria each year to stay at Balmoral, he never accepted.

==Legacy==

A marble bust of Lewis, by Henry Weekes, stands in Westminster Abbey. A large monument was built in his memory in the small village of New Radnor, Powys and still stands today, as does a statue in front of the Shirehall, Hereford.

==Family==

In 1844 Lewis married the biographer Lady Maria Theresa Villiers. She was a daughter of George Villiers and Theresa Parker and younger sister of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon; the widow of novelist Thomas Henry Lister, and mother of three children by him. Much of their married life was spent in Kent House, Knightsbridge. They had no children of their own.

<text>Prav (Правь), Yav (Явь) and Nav (Навь) are the three dimensions or qualities of the cosmos as described in the first chapter of the Book of Light and in the &quot;Book of Veles&quot; (probably a fabrication from the 19-20 century) of Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery). Older sources mention only Nav and Yav concepts of ancient slavic cosmology, similar to Yin and Yang in Taoism, and Prav was not part of the concept. The literal meanings of the Prav, Yav, and Nav words, are, respectively, [[Prav-Yav-Nav|&quot;Right&quot;]], [[Prav-Yav-Nav|&quot;actuality&quot;]] and [[Prav-Yav-Nav|&quot;probability&quot;]]. They are also symbolised as a unity by the god Triglav (the &quot;Three-Headed One&quot;). Already Ebbo (c. 775 – 20 March 851, who was archbishop of Reims) documented that the Triglav was seen as embodying the connection and mediation between Heaven, Earth and the underworld / humanity; these three dimensions were also respectively associated to the colours white, green and black as documented by Karel Jaromír Erben.

==History of the concept==

Book of Veles, Tablet No. 1:

In the interpretation of the neopagan ideologue and popularizer of the Book of Veles, Alexander Asov (1992), this means:

The publisher and probable falsifier of the Book of Veles, Yury Mirolyubov, interprets these terms as follows:

According to Slavic neopaganism, death as such does not exist. There is a state of afterlife, in which a person does not lose consciousness and waits for his reincarnation in Nav - parallels are drawn with ancient Hades. After bodily death, a person can remain in Yav as a guardian of a kind - chur or domovoy. They can go to the Veles Meadows in Nav, awaiting their fate, or be attributed to the gods and heroes in Iriy (Prav) and create the fate of other worlds. The world of Yav belongs to people, and they determine its fate.

From Mirolyubov, the idea of &quot;Yav, Prav and Nav&quot; was borrowed by one of the founders of Russian neopaganism, Valery Yemelyanov. In his book &quot;Dezionization&quot; (1979), he wrote that the &quot;Veneti&quot; constituted the &quot;backbone&quot; of the &quot;Aryan&quot; community and were the main guardians of the &quot;general Aryan&quot; ideology. The purity of language and ideology, according to Yemelyanov, was preserved only &quot;in the vastness from Novgorod to the Black Sea&quot;, where the idea of &quot;the trinity of three triune trinities&quot; (&quot;Prav-Yav-Nav&quot;, &quot;Svarog-Perun-Svetovid&quot;) was preserved and reigned a golden age.

The neopagan writer Vladimir Shcherbakov believed that the formula &quot;Yav, Nav, Prav&quot; means the trinity of the world of people, spirits, and gods and was the basis of the Slavic pagan faith, which was the key to the invincibility of ancient ancestors.

Another writer close to neopaganism, Yuri Petukhov, also wrote about the triad of &quot;Prav, Yav, Nav&quot;, borrowed from the Book of Veles.

&quot;Yav-Prav-Nav&quot; appears in the neopagan Concept of Public Security of Russia &quot;Dead Water&quot; (KOB) by Major General Konstantin Petrov (volkhv Meragor).

In the &quot;Slavic-Aryan Vedas&quot;, the sacred scripture of Ynglism, a direction of Slavic neopaganism created by the Omsk esotericist Alexander Khinevich, a fourth component, &quot;Slav&quot; (Glory) is added to the native faith triad &quot;Yav, Prav, Nav&quot;. Like Yemelyanov and Asov, several different &quot;trinities&quot; (&quot;Great Triglavs of the Worlds&quot;) are constructed, the number of which reaches seven.

The neopagan ideologue Dmitry Gavrilov (Yggeld, the Bera Circle community) interprets the triad &quot;Yav, Prav, and Nav&quot; by Gavrilov without reference to the original source (Book of Veles) within the framework of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy as thesis, synthesis, and antithesis. After the publication of &quot;Izvednik&quot;, Gavrilov admitted that the noun &quot;Prav&quot; is not found in reliable sources and is a lexical innovation. However, he expressed confidence that there was a &quot;third component of the triad,&quot; but it had a different name.

==General meaning==

Following the description in the Book of Veles, many modern practitioners of Slavic Native Faith describe Prav (&quot;Right&quot;; cf. Greek &quot;Orthotes&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;Ṛta&quot;) as being the universal order otherwise described as the &quot;Law of Heaven&quot;, which is enacted by the supreme God (Род &quot;Rod&quot;, &quot;Generation&quot; itself in Slavic theology) and permeates and regulates the other two hypostases. It is conceived as being at the same time the plane of gods, who generate entities in accordance with the supreme order; gods and the entities that they beget &quot;make up&quot; the great God. Yav (&quot;actuality&quot;) is believed to be the plane of matter and appearance, the here and now in which things appear in light, coalesce, but also dissolve in contingency; Nav (&quot;probability&quot;) is held to be the world of human ancestors, of spirit, consisting in the memory of the past and the projection of the future, that is to say the continuity of time.

==Descriptions==

===Triglav: soul, flesh and power===
Represented as Triglav the three worlds are traditionally associated, respectively, to the three gods Svarog (&quot;Heaven&quot;), Perun (&quot;Thunder&quot;) and Dažbog (&quot;Sun&quot;) or Svarog, Perun, and Svetovid (&quot;Sacred Lord&quot;) or Veles (&quot;Underworld&quot;). These three gods are also seen, respectively, as representing the qualities of soul, flesh and power. Perun and Svetovid are regarded as manifestations of the same Svarog, and other names for them are Dazhbog (&quot;Giving God&quot;, &quot;Day God&quot;) and Svarozhich (the god of fire, literally meaning &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;). The netherworld (Nav), especially in its dark aspect, is also traditionally embodied by Veles, who in this function is the god of waters but also the one who guides athwart them (cf. Sanskrit &quot;Varuna&quot;).

In his study of Slavic cosmology, Jiří Dynda (2014), identifies Triglav as a conception of the &quot;axis mundi&quot;, and compares it to similar concepts from other Indo-European cultures. He gives weight to the Triglav as a representation of what Georges Dumézil studied as the &quot;Indo-European trifunctional hypothesis&quot; (holy, martial and economic functions reflected by three human types and social classes).

The Triglav may also represents the interweaving of the three dimensions of time, metaphorically represented as a three-threaded rope. By Ebbo&#x27;s words, the Triglav is definable as &quot;summus deus&quot;, the god representing the &quot;sum&quot; of the three dimensions of reality as a mountain or tree (themselves symbols of the &quot;axis mundi&quot;). According to Dynda, this threefold vision originating in Proto-Indo-European religion was also elaborated in early and medieval Christianity giving rise to the theology of God who is at the same time creator (father), creature (son) and creating activity (spirit).

===Heaven, Earth and humanity in &quot;genotheism&quot;===
In her theological commentaries to the &quot;Book of Veles&quot;, the Ukrainian Rodnover leader Halyna Lozko emphasises the cosmological unity of the three planes of Heaven, Earth and humanity between them. She gives a definition of Rodnover theology and cosmology as &quot;genotheism&quot;. God, hierarchically manifesting as different hypostases, a multiplicity of gods emerging from the all-pervading force Svarog, is genetically (&quot;rodovid&quot;) linked to humanity. On the human plane God is incarnated by the progenitors/ancestors and the kin lineage, in the Earth. Ethics and morality ultimately stem from this cosmology, as harmony with nature is possible only in the relationship between an ethnic group and its own land. The same vision of a genetic essence of divinity is called &quot;rodotheism&quot; by the Rodnover denomination of the Ynglists.

The worship of human progenitors, such as the alleged forefather of the Slavs and Aryans &quot;Or&quot; or &quot;Oryi&quot;, or local forefathers such as &quot;Dingling&quot; worshipped by Vladivostok Rodnovers, is common. Divine ancestors are believed to be the spirits who both kin and generators and holders together of kinship. The Russian volkhv and neo-Nazi leader Alexey Dobrovolsky (also known as Dobroslav) emphasised the importance of blood heritage, claiming that the violation of kinship purity brings about the loss of the relationship with the kin&#x27;s divine ancestor.

His father George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer had served in the ministries of Pitt the Younger, Charles James Fox and Lord Grenville, and was First Lord of the Admiralty (1794–1801). George Spencer was married to the eldest daughter of Lord Lucan. Their eldest son, John Charles, was born at Spencer House, London, on 30 May 1782. In 1800, after Harrow, he took up his residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, and for some time applied himself energetically to mathematical studies; but he spent most of his time in hunting and racing. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire on 5 June 1803.

In 1804, he entered parliament as a member for Okehampton in Devon. He vacated his seat in 1806, to contest the University of Cambridge against Lord Henry Petty and Lord Palmerston (when he was hopelessly beaten), but he was elected that same year for St Albans, and appointed a lord of the treasury. At the general election in November 1806, he was elected for Northamptonshire, and he continued to sit for the county until he succeeded to the peerage. For the next few years after this speech, Lord Althorp occasionally spoke in debates and was always on the side of Liberalism, but from 1813 to 1818 he was only rarely in the House of Commons. His absence was partly due to a feeling that it was hopeless to struggle against the will of the Tory ministry, but more particularly because of the death of his wife.

==Leader of the Commons==
In 1819, on his return to political life, he pressed for establishing a more efficient bankruptcy court, and of expediting the recovery of small debts; and he saw both these reforms accomplished before 1825. During the greater part of the reign of George IV, the Whigs lost their influence in the state from their want of cohesion, but this defect was soon remedied in 1830 when Lord Althorp was chosen their leader in the lower house, and his capacity for the position was proved by experience. In Lord Grey&#x27;s government Althorp was both Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was instrumental in the success of the government measures. Along with Lord John Russell, he led the fight to pass the Reform Bill of 1832, making more than twenty speeches, and is generally considered the architect of its victory. It was also under Spencer&#x27;s leadership and consistent lobbying that the House of Commons abolished slavery throughout the British Empire in 1833.

==The Lords==
After the dissolution of 1833, the Whig government had been slowly dying, and was further weakened by Althorp&#x27;s promotion to the House of Lords following the death of his father in 1834. The new Lord Spencer abandoned the cares of office and returned to country life with unalloyed delight. Henceforth agriculture, not politics, was his principal interest. He was a notable cattle breeder and the first president of the Royal Agricultural Society which was founded in 1838, the year he paid homage to Queen Victoria at her Coronation. Though often urged by his political friends to come to their assistance, he rarely quit the peaceful pleasures which he loved. He died without issue at Wiseton on 1 October 1845, and was succeeded by his brother Frederick (died 1857).

==Reputation and legacy==
The Whigs required, to carry the Reform Bill, a leader above party spirit. &quot;Honest Jack Althorp&quot; has been called &quot;the most decent man who ever held high Government office&quot;. Although he was not a particularly good public speaker, his integrity was an invaluable asset to the Government. Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge said that one of John Wilson Croker&#x27;s speeches was demolished by the simple statement of Lord Althorp that he &quot;had collected some figures which entirely refuted it, but had lost them.&quot; To Croker&#x27;s credit, he replied that he would never doubt Althorp&#x27;s word.

Spencer Street in Melbourne, is named in his honour.

==Marriage==
On 13 April 1814, Spencer married Esther Acklom (September 1788 – 11 June 1818) at Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, London. Cokayne quotes from the Farington Diaries, &quot;in marrying He complied with the wishes of Lord and Lady Spencer, it was not of His own seeking&quot; and from the Letter Bag of Lady Elizabeth Spencer-Stanhope, &quot;since Jack Althorp would not propose to her, she proposed to him; and such an unusual proceeding was fraught with happy consequences ... his devotion after marriage amply compensated for his lack of ardour before.&quot; Esther died on 11 June 1818 at the age of 29 at Halkin Street, Belgravia, London, England, in childbirth and she was buried on 18 June 1818 in Brington, Northamptonshire, England. John was said to be deeply upset by his wife&#x27;s death and was devoted to her memory for the rest of his life: he resolved never to remarry, and it is said that he gave up hunting, his favourite pastime, to mark the depth of his loss.

<text>James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope (1673 – 5 February 1721) was a British Army officer and Whig politician who effectively served as Chief Minister between 1717 and 1721. He was also the last Chancellor of the Exchequer to sit in the House of Lords.

Born in Paris as the son of a prominent diplomat, Stanhope pursued a military career. Although he also served in Flanders and Italy, he is best remembered for his service in Portugal and Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was the first British Governor of Minorca, which he captured from the Spanish in 1708.

In 1710 he commanded the British contingent of the Allied Army which occupied Madrid, having won a decisive victory at the Battle of Zaragoza. Having then evacuated the Spanish capital, Stanhope&#x27;s rearguard on the retreat to Barcelona were overwhelmed and forced to surrender at Brihuega.

Paroled, he returned to Britain and pursued a political career as a Whig. A supporter of the Hanoverian Succession he was rewarded with office by George I in 1714. As Southern Secretary he oversaw the negotiation of an Anglo-French Alliance. Emerging as the dominant figure in government after 1717, following the Whig Split, he led Britain to success in a new Spanish War and suppressed a Jacobite Rising in 1719. However, the government was overtaken by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble and he died in office. He is occasionally mentioned as an alternative candidate to Robert Walpole as Britain&#x27;s first Prime Minister.

==Background and education==
Stanhope was born in Paris in 1673, the eldest of the seven children of Alexander Stanhope (1638–1707), and his wife Katherine (died 1718), the daughter and co-heir of Arnold Burghill, of Thinghall Parva, Withington, Herefordshire, by his second wife Grizell, co-heir of John Prise of Ocle Pyrchard, Herefordshire. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he matriculated in May 1688.

Stanhope accompanied his father, then English Ambassador to Madrid, to Spain in 1690, and obtained some knowledge of that country which was very useful to him in later life.

A little later he went to Italy where, as afterwards in Flanders, he served as a volunteer against France, and in 1695 he secured a commission in the English army. In 1701 Stanhope entered the House of Commons, but he continued his career as a soldier and was in Spain and Portugal during the earlier stages of the War of the Spanish Succession.

==Spanish Campaigns==
===Cadiz===

During the opening stages of the war he was in Ireland on recruiting duty. He desperately sought a chance of combat, and was given permission to accompany the Duke of Ormonde&#x27;s expedition to Cadiz. The attempt to capture Cadiz failed, but the expedition enjoyed success on the return journey at the Battle of Vigo Bay.

===Portugal===
In 1703 he served with the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s Army in the Low Countries, having arrived too late to take part in the Siege of Bonn. His regiment was then transferred to Lisbon. Due to Portugal&#x27;s entry into the war on the Allied side, a large British continent was sent to assist them. While Stanhope was in Lisbon recovering from an attack of fever his regiment was part of a Portuguese-commanded garrison which surrendered the town of Portalegre.

===Barcelona===

In 1705 he served in Spain under Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough, notably at the Siege of Barcelona and in 1706 he was appointed English minister in Spain, but his duties were still military as well as diplomatic, and in 1708, after some differences with Peterborough, who favoured defensive measures only, he was made commander-in-chief of the British forces in that country.

===Minorca===

Taking the offensive he captured Port Mahon, Minorca. During the operation his younger brother Philip Stanhope, a naval officer, was killed.

===Madrid campaign===
After a visit to England in which he took part in the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, he returned to Spain for the campaign of 1710, with Allied victories at Almenar and Saragossa in July and August enabling Archduke Charles to enter Madrid in September. On the back of these triumphs, Stanhope was selected as the Whig candidate for the Westminster seat in the 1710 General Election, with his cousin Lt-General Sherington Davenport as proxy in his absence.

===Defeat===
Unlike many constituencies, Westminster had a relatively large electorate of over 10,000 and its proximity to both Court and Parliament meant the result often influenced others. Almenar was used to promote &#x27;brave, virtuous Stanhope&#x27; but his Tory opponent Thomas Crosse easily won the seat aided by the satirist Jonathan Swift who published thinly disguised accusations of Stanhope&#x27;s homosexuality. The Tories won the General election in December by a landslide, by which time Stanhope was a prisoner in Spain but this theme was to form an important part of his future image.

Lack of support from the local population meant the Allies entered an almost deserted Madrid and were effectively isolated when Portuguese forces were prevented from crossing into Spain. In November, the Allies left Madrid for Catalonia in separate detachments, one of 5,000 under Stanhope and the second of 12,000 under the Austrian Starhemberg. Stanhope&#x27;s division was taken by surprise and forced to surrender by a French army led by Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme at Brihuega on 9 December 1710. The next day Vendôme followed this up by defeating Starhemberg at Villaviciosa; these defeats were a devastating setback to Allied ambitions in Spain. Although Allied forces continued to operate out of Catalonia, British commitment to the war was already waning under the new Tory government and Stanhope&#x27;s replacement as British commander in Spain the Duke of Argyll took no offensive action.

Of great significance was the death of Emperor Joseph I in April 1711 which meant Archduke Charles became Emperor Charles VI. This caused Britain to withdraw from the war since a Spanish and Austrian union threatened the European balance of power, and was as unwelcome as a French one. Philip V retained the Spanish throne, although lost many of Spain&#x27;s traditional territories. Later Stanhope would admit to Queen Anne that he believed that the Spanish campaign was flawed in its general strategy, and even with more troops deployed there would struggle given the general preference of the Spanish population for Philip over Charles.

Most of the prisoners taken at Brihuega were quickly exchanged but Stanhope himself remained a prisoner in Spain and only returned to England in August 1712, coming via Paris where he encountered the Tory politician Henry St. John who was there negotiating a peace treaty with France.

==Political career, 1712–1721==
Once back in Britain he now abandoned his military career and moved wholly into politics. He soon sat for another seat, Wendover, and became one of the leaders of the Whig opposition in the House of Commons to Robert Harley&#x27;s Tory administration. In particular he opposed the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht by which Britain unilaterally made peace with France and abandoned its allies. He was a staunch supporter of the House of Hanover. Once George I succeeded to the throne following the death of Queen Anne in 1714, he replaced the Tory government with a largely Whig one. Several senior Tories were either imprisoned or fled into exile due to their perceived support of the Jacobite James Stuart.

===Secretary of State===

In September 1714 he was appointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department. With Walpole he provided the leadership of the House of Commons. In early 1715 the new government&#x27;s position was secured when it won a decisive election victory.

He was mainly responsible for the measures which were instrumental in crushing the Jacobite rising of 1715. He forwarded the passing of the Septennial Act in 1716 that established that general elections should be held every seven years. In July 1716 he accompanied George I on his return to Hanover.

He acted as George I&#x27;s foreign minister, and only just failed to conclude a treaty of alliance with France in 1716. In 1717 there was a dramatic schism in the Whig Party with Stanhope and Sunderland forming one grouping while Walpole and Townshend opposed them. Walpole led his supporters into opposition, coinciding with a similar dispute within the royal family between George I and his son George, Prince of Wales. This Whig Split divided the dominant Whig movement for three years.

===Emergence as First Minister===

In 1717, consequent on changes in the ministry, Stanhope was made First Lord of the Treasury, and was the last Chancellor of the Exchequer to sit in the House of Lords. A year later he returned to his former office of secretary for the southern department. On 3 July 1717, he was created Baron Stanhope of Elvaston and Viscount Stanhope of Mahon and, on 14 April 1718, Earl Stanhope. He was in all but name &quot;Prime Minister&quot; and is sometimes presented as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain, rather than Sir Robert Walpole who is more usually considered as that figure.

Domestically his government suffered a defeat when the Impeachment of Robert Harley, former first minister, ended in his acquittal in July 1717.

===War of the Quadruple Alliance===

He saw Britain&#x27;s principal foreign policy goals as containing the threat of Spanish, Austrian or Russian expansionist tendencies.
His activity was now shown in the conclusion of the Quadruple Alliance between Britain, France, Austria and the United Provinces in 1718, and in obtaining peace for Sweden, when threatened by Russia and Denmark. He entered delicate negotiations with Spain which wished for the return of Gibraltar, which he was only prepared to do in exchange for Cuba and Florida. Ultimately the talks broke down, setting the path to the later Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar.

In the ensuing War of the Quadruple Alliance British forces were involved in a campaign to prevent Spanish expansion in Italy. Spain landed troops in Scotland in support of the Jacobites who they hoped to restore to the throne. The expedition was defeated at the Battle of Glen Shiel and in retaliation the British dispatched a force that briefly captured Vigo in October 1719. In the wake of these setbacks Spain agreed to the Treaty of The Hague the following year.

Domestically, he promoted the Peerage Bill of 1719 to limit the membership of the House of Lords a controversial move as it was seen as an attack directed at his former Whig colleagues led by Walpole. His attempts at pushing for greater religious toleration were defeated by Walpole&#x27;s supporters.

===South Sea Bubble===

Just after the collapse of the South Sea Bubble, for which he was partly responsible but from which he did not profit, the earl was defending his government with customary vigour and panache in House of Lords on 4 February 1721 when he was taken ill with a violent headache. After some apparent recovery the following day, he died of a stroke at eight o&#x27;clock that evening. The king was shocked and distraught at the sudden &quot;loss of so able and faithful a minister, of whose service his Majesty had so great need at this critical juncture&quot;. On the king&#x27;s orders Stanhope was given a full military funeral through London on 17 February to Southwark, and he was afterwards privately buried at Chevening. He was succeeded by his eldest son Philip (1714–1786), a distinguished mathematician and a fellow of the Royal Society.

==Reputation==
Basil Williams said Stanhope, &quot;had no special bent for domestic politics... His impetuosity and want of experience indeed led him into mistakes sometimes in dealing with internal questions.&quot; However, Williams goes on to argue that:
:On the other hand, in foreign politics his comprehensive grasp of European conditions and of England&#x27;s essential interests, his tact and self-control in dealings with foreign allies or opponents, and the blunt honesty of his diplomacy gave him an ascendancy rarely equaled by any of our foreign ministers. This ascendancy was the more remarkable since it had peace alone as its object and its result. The long epoch of comparative security in external relations which enabled Walpole quietly to consolidate the country&#x27;s internal prosperity on a sound basis was mainly due to Stanhope&#x27;s achievement in foreign policy.

==Family==
On 24 February 1713, Stanhope married Lucy Pitt (1692–1723), a younger daughter of Thomas Pitt, the first governor of Madras, and aunt to William Pitt the Elder. Although Stanhope found little time for domesticity, it was a happy union, and the couple had seven children, including two sets of twins:
*Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl Stanhope (1714–1786)
*Lady Lucy Stanhope (15 August 171415 May 1785)
*Lt-Col Hon. George Stanhope (28 December 171724 January 1754)
*Lady Gertrude Stanhope (born 1718), died young
*Lady Jane Stanhope (born 30 October 1719)
*Hon. James Stanhope (19 August 172121 April 1730)
*Lady Catherine Stanhope (born 19 August 1721), died young

His sister Mary, one of Queen Anne&#x27;s six Maids of Honour, 1702–1707, married Charles, 1st Viscount Fane in 1707.

<doc id="310514" wikidata="Q332619" url="?curid=310514" title="Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland">
<text>Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, KG, PC (23 April 167519 April 1722), known as Lord Spencer from 1688 to 1702, was a British statesman from the Spencer family. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1714–1717), Lord Privy Seal (1715–1716), Lord President of the Council (1718–1719) and First Lord of the Treasury (1718–1721).

He is an ancestor of both Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales, and through her, the current heir to the Monarchy of the United Kingdom, William, Prince of Wales.

==Early life==
He was the second son of Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland and Anne Digby, daughter of George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol. On the death of his elder brother Robert in Paris in September 1688, he became heir to the peerage. Called by John Evelyn &quot;a youth of extraordinary hopes,&quot; he completed his education at Utrecht, and in 1695 entered the House of Commons as member for Tiverton. In the same year, he married Arabella, daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle; she died in 1698 and in 1700, he married Anne Churchill, daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. This was an important alliance for Sunderland and for his descendants; through it, he was introduced to political life and later the dukedom of Marlborough came to the Spencers.

In 1698 he plunged his family into scandal when his brother-in-law Donogh MacCarthy, 4th Earl of Clancarty, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London for his support for James II and later escaped, was reconciled with his long-estranged wife, Charles&#x27; sister Elizabeth, and at long last consummated the marriage. Charles, alerted by his father&#x27;s servants, had Clancarty arrested while he was actually in bed with Elizabeth. The result was a public uproar which gravely embarrassed their parents. William III treated the matter as a trifle, wondering why everyone he met teased him about &quot;that little spark Clancarty&quot;, and gave the couple permission to settle in Altona, Hamburg. Elizabeth, who died in Hamburg in 1704, never saw her parents or brother again. His father&#x27;s biographer comments that the affair did not show Charles in a good light either as a man or a brother.

==Career==
Having succeeded to the peerage in 1702, Sunderland was one of the commissioners for the union between England and Scotland, and in 1705, he was sent to Vienna as envoy extraordinary. Although he was tinged with republican ideas and had made himself obnoxious to Queen Anne by opposing the grant to her husband, Prince George, through the influence of Marlborough he was foisted into the ministry as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, taking office in December 1706.

From 1708 to 1710, he was one of the five Whigs collectively called the &quot;Junto&quot;, who dominated the government, but he had many enemies, the Queen still disliked him, and in June 1710, he was dismissed. Anne offered him a pension of £3000 a year, but this he refused, saying &quot;if he could not have the honour to serve his country he would not plunder it.&quot; When Marlborough protested about the dismissal, the Queen inquired sarcastically whether &quot;the Peace of Europe must depend on it?&quot; She added that Sunderland was universally unpopular, which was indeed the case.

Sunderland continued to take part in public life, and was active in communicating with the court of Hanover about the steps to be taken in view of the approaching death of the queen. He made the acquaintance of George I in 1706, but when the elector became king, Sunderland only secured the comparatively unimportant position of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In August 1715, he joined the cabinet as Lord Privy Seal. After a visit to George I in Hanover, he secured, in April 1717, the position of Secretary of State for the Northern Department. This he retained until March 1718, when he became First Lord of the Treasury, holding also the post of Lord President of the Council. He was now effectively the prime minister. Sunderland was especially interested in the proposed Peerage Bill, a measure designed to limit the number of members of the House of Lords, but this was defeated owing partly to the opposition of Sir Robert Walpole. 
In 1719, he succeeded Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset in the court position as Groom of the Stool to King George I, which he held until his death in 1722. He was also made a knight of the Order of the Garter in 1719. He was also a main subscriber in the Royal Academy of Music, a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage.

The bursting of the South Sea Bubble led to his political ruin. He had taken some part in launching the scheme of 1720, therefore public opinion was roused against him and it was only through the efforts of Walpole that he was acquitted by the House of Commons, when the matter was investigated. In April 1721, he resigned his offices, but he retained his influence with George I until his own death on 19 April 1722.

Sunderland inherited his father&#x27;s passion for intrigue, while his manners were repelling, but he stands high among his associates for disinterestedness and had an alert and discerning mind. From his early years, he had a great love of books, and he spent his leisure and his wealth in forming the library at Althorp, which in 1703 was described as &quot;the finest in Europe.&quot; In 1749, part of it was removed to Blenheim Palace.

In 1722 Sunderland was implicated in what became known as the Atterbury Plot, to restore the House of Stuart, and his death was one of the factors which brought the Plot to light.

The town of Sunderland, Massachusetts, was named in his honour in November 1718, just after he became Lord President of the Council.

==Marriages and children==
His first wife was Lady Arabella Cavendish (19 August 16734 June 1698), daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. They had one daughter:
*Lady Frances Spencer (27 July 1742), married Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle.

His second wife was Lady Anne Churchill (27 February 168315 April 1716). She died in April 1716, after a career of considerable influence on the political life of her time. They had six children:
*Hon. Robert Spencer (2 December 170012 September 1701).
*Robert Spencer, 4th Earl of Sunderland (24 October 170127 November 1729).
*Lady Anne Spencer (170219 February 1769), married William Bateman, 1st Viscount Bateman.
*Charles Spencer, 5th Earl of Sunderland (22 November 170620 October 1758), succeeded his aunt, Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, as 3rd Duke of Marlborough.
*Hon. John Spencer (13 May 170819 June 1746), father of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer.
*Lady Diana Spencer (171027 September 1735), married John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford.

In 1717, he married an Irish lady of fortune, Judith Tichborne (17 May 1749), daughter of Sir Benjamin Tichborne of Beaulieu (younger brother of Sir Henry Tichborne, 1st Baron Ferrard, Irish cr. 1715) and Elizabeth Gibbs. They had three children who died in infancy:
*Unnamed child (born and died 1718).
*Lady Margaret Spencer (born and died 1719) - her coffin was removed from St James&#x27; Church London where she had been first been buried and interred at the family vault in Great Brington Church on the same day as her father&#x27;s burial that of 1st May 1722
*Hon. William Spencer (172017 April 1722) - interred in the family vault in Great Brinton Church on the same day as his father that of 1st May 1722

After his death, she married Sir Robert Sutton (1671 – 13 August 1746).

<text>In mathematics, the lower limit topology or right half-open interval topology is a topology defined on formula_1, the set of real numbers; it is different from the standard topology on formula_1 (generated by the open intervals) and has a number of interesting properties. It is the topology generated by the basis of all half-open intervals [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;), where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are real numbers.

The resulting topological space is called the Sorgenfrey line after Robert Sorgenfrey or the arrow and is sometimes written formula_3. Like the Cantor set and the long line, the Sorgenfrey line often serves as a useful counterexample to many otherwise plausible-sounding conjectures in general topology. 
The product of formula_3 with itself is also a useful counterexample, known as the Sorgenfrey plane.

In complete analogy, one can also define the upper limit topology, or left half-open interval topology.

== Properties ==
* The lower limit topology is finer (has more open sets) than the standard topology on the real numbers (which is generated by the open intervals). The reason is that every open interval can be written as a (countably infinite) union of half-open intervals.
* For any real formula_5 and formula_6, the interval formula_7 is clopen in formula_3 (i.e., both open and closed). Furthermore, for all real formula_5, the sets formula_10 and formula_11 are also clopen. This shows that the Sorgenfrey line is totally disconnected.
* Any compact subset of formula_3 must be an at most countable set. To see this, consider a non-empty compact subset formula_13. Fix an formula_14, consider the following open cover of formula_15:
::formula_16
:Since formula_15 is compact, this cover has a finite subcover, and hence there exists a real number formula_18 such that the interval formula_19 contains no point of formula_15 apart from formula_21. This is true for all formula_22. Now choose a rational number formula_23. Since the intervals formula_19, parametrized by formula_14, are pairwise disjoint, the function formula_26 is injective, and so formula_15 is at most countable.

* The name &quot;lower limit topology&quot; comes from the following fact: a sequence (or net) formula_28 in formula_3 converges to the limit formula_30 if and only if it &quot;approaches formula_30 from the right&quot;, meaning for every formula_32 there exists an index formula_33 such that formula_34. The Sorgenfrey line can thus be used to study right-sided limits: if formula_35 is a function, then the ordinary right-sided limit of formula_36 at formula_21 (when the codomain carries the standard topology) is the same as the usual limit of formula_36 at formula_21 when the domain is equipped with the lower limit topology and the codomain carries the standard topology.
* In terms of separation axioms, formula_3 is a perfectly normal Hausdorff space.
* In terms of countability axioms, formula_3 is first-countable and separable, but not second-countable.
* In terms of compactness properties, formula_3 is Lindelöf and paracompact, but not σ-compact nor locally compact.
* formula_3 is not metrizable, since separable metric spaces are second-countable. However, the topology of a Sorgenfrey line is generated by a quasimetric.
* formula_3 is a Baire space.
* formula_3 does not have any connected compactifications.

<doc id="310519" wikidata="Q38308" url="?curid=310519" title="Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath">
<text>Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath (13 September 173419 November 1796), of Longleat in Wiltshire, was a British politician who held office under King George III. He served as Southern Secretary, Northern Secretary and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Between 1751 and 1789, he was known as the 3rd Viscount Weymouth. He is possibly best known for his role in the Falklands Crisis of 1770.

==Early life==
He was born on 13 September 1734, the eldest son and heir of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth (1710–1751) by his wife Louisa Carteret (c. 1712–1736), a daughter of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, 2nd Baron Carteret (1690–1763). On her father&#x27;s side, she was a great-granddaughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701), and her father&#x27;s first-cousin was William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692–1711), on whose death the Earldom of Bath became extinct.

===Family origins===
The Thynnes are descended from Sir John Thynne (c. 1515–1580), the builder of Longleat House, the family seat in Wiltshire, who acquired vast estates after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Sir John owed his wealth and position to the favour of his master, the Lord Protector Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. He was comptroller of the household of the future Queen Elizabeth I of England. Another famous ancestor was Thomas Thynne (1648–1682), called on account of his wealth &quot;Tom of Ten Thousand&quot; and celebrated by Dryden as Issachar in &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;, who was murdered in London in February 1682.

==Career==
He succeeded his father as 3rd Viscount Weymouth in January 1751 and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for a short time during 1765, although he never visited that country. Having become prominent in British politics, he was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department in January 1768 and acted with great promptitude during the unrest caused by John Wilkes and the Middlesex election of 1768. He was then attacked and libeled by Wilkes, who was consequently expelled from the House of Commons.

===Falklands Crisis===
Before the close of 1768, he was transferred from the Northern Department to become Secretary of State for the Southern Department, but he resigned in December 1770 in the midst of the &quot;Falklands Crisis&quot;, a dispute with Spain over the possession of the Falkland Islands.

===American War of Independence===
In November 1775, Weymouth returned to his former office of Secretary of State for the Southern Department, undertaking in addition the duties attached to the northern department for a few months in 1779, but he resigned both positions in the autumn of that year. This period covered the American War of Independence.

==Later life==
He was High Steward of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield from 1781 until his death in November 1796, having been created Marquess of Bath in 1789. The title of Earl of Bath that had been held by his Granville ancestor was then unavailable, as it had been recreated for a member of the Pulteney family.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1759, he married Lady Elizabeth Bentinck, daughter of William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland and the art collector Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, with whom he had three sons and five daughters, including:
* Lady Louisa Thynne (born 25 March 1760)
* Lady Henrietta Thynne (born 16 November 1762)
*Lady Sophia Thynne (born 18 December 1763)
*Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath (25 January 1765 – 27 March 1837), eldest son and heir.
* Lady Maria Thynne (born 1 August 1767, died March 1768)
*Lady Isabella Thynne (born 1 October 1768)
*George Thynne, 2nd Baron Carteret (23 January 1770 – 19 February 1838), who inherited the title Baron Carteret by special remainder from his paternal uncle Henry Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret (1735–1826) (born Henry Thynne), of Haynes Park in Bedfordshire and of Stowe House, Kilkhampton in Cornwall, the seat of his ancestor John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701), which descended via the Carteret family.

==Legacy==
Weymouth Street in Marylebone is named after him. His wife&#x27;s family once owned the land on which the street was later built.

<doc id="310522" wikidata="Q3410599" url="?curid=310522" title="Cory's shearwater">
<text>Cory&#x27;s shearwater (Calonectris borealis) is a large shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. It breeds colonially on the archipelago of the Azores in the eastern Atlantic. Outside the breeding season it ranges widely in the Atlantic. It was formerly considered to be conspecific with Scopoli&#x27;s shearwater.

==Taxonomy==
Cory&#x27;s shearwater was formally described in 1881 by the American ornithologist Charles B. Cory from a specimen collected off Chatham Island, Massachusetts. He coined the binomial name &quot;Puffinus borealis&quot;. Cory&#x27;s shearwater is now placed in the genus &quot;Calonectris&quot; that was introduced in 1915 by the ornithologists Gregory Mathews and Tom Iredale. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;kalos&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot; or &quot;noble&quot; with the genus name &quot;Nectris&quot; that was used for shearwaters by the German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. The name &quot;Nectris&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word &quot;nēktris&quot; meaning &quot;swimmer&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;borealis&quot; is Latin and means &quot;north&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The Cape Verde shearwater &quot;C. edwardsii&quot; (Oustalet, 1883) was once considered a subspecies of Cory&#x27;s shearwater but has been split off as a separate species . It is endemic to the Cape Verde Islands and has an all dark, slim bill, and darker head and upperparts than Cory&#x27;s. The flight has been described as rather more typically shearwater-like than the Cory&#x27;s, with stiffer and more rapid wing beats.

Scopoli&#x27;s shearwater and Cory&#x27;s shearwater were previously considered as conspecific. They formed the Cory&#x27;s shearwater complex (&quot;Calonectris diomedea&quot;). Based on the lack of hybridization and differences in mitochondrial DNA, morphology and vocalization, the complex was split into two separate species. The English name &quot;Cory&#x27;s shearwater&quot; was transferred to &quot;Calonectris borealis&quot; while what was previously the nominate subspecies became Scopoli&#x27;s shearwater (&quot;Calonectris diomedea&quot;).

==Description==
This shearwater is identifiable by its size, at in length and with a wingspan. It has brownish-grey upperparts, white underparts and a yellowish bill. It lacks the brown belly patch, dark shoulder markings and black cap of the great shearwater.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species breeds on Madeira, the Azores and the Berlengas Archipelago in Portugal and the Canary Islands in Spain. 

==Behaviour and ecology==
This bird flies with long glides, and always with wings bowed and angled slightly back, unlike the stiff, straight-winged flight of the similarly sized great shearwater.

===Breeding===
They nest on open ground or among rocks or less often in a burrow where one white egg is laid. The burrow is visited at night to minimise predation from large gulls. In late summer and autumn, most birds migrate into the Atlantic as far north as the south-western coasts of Great Britain and Ireland. They return to the Mediterranean in February. The biggest colony is located in Savage Islands, Madeira.

===Food and feeding===
Cory&#x27;s shearwater feeds on fish, molluscs and offal, and can dive deep ( or more) in search of prey. It readily follows fishing boats, where it indulges in noisy squabbles. This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from ships or appropriate headlands. The Bay of Biscay ferries are particularly good for this species. It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls.

<doc id="310529" wikidata="Q947776" url="?curid=310529" title="Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin">
<text>Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin, (15 June 1645 – 15 September 1712) was a British Tory statesman. He was a Privy Councillor and Secretary of State for the Northern Department before he attained real power as First Lord of the Treasury. He was instrumental in negotiating and passing the Acts of Union 1707 with Scotland, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain. He had many other roles, including that of Governor of Scilly.

==Family and early career==
He came from an ancient Cornish family as the son of Sir Francis Godolphin (1605–1667) and nephew of the poet Sidney Godolphin. At the Restoration, he was introduced into the royal household by King Charles II of England, whose favourite he had become, and he also entered the House of Commons as member for Helston, in Cornwall. Although he spoke few words before the House, they were so to the point that he &quot;gradually acquired a reputation as its chief if not its only financial authority&quot;. In 1668, he was a successful intermediary between the King and his sister Henrietta Anne, the wife of the Duke of Orléans, to secure an agreement with King Louis XIV of France to reject England&#x27;s Dutch allies in return for French money. In 1669, he was awarded a 31-year lease on all tin mines in Rialton and Retraigh in Cornwall. In 1670, Godolphin was appointed Groom of the Bedchamber along with a pension of £500 per annum. He held that post until 1678. The King said that he valued Godolphin because he was &quot;never in the way and never out of the way&quot;.

Charles appointed Godolphin envoy-extraordinary to Louis XIV in 1672 to reassure France of Charles&#x27;s allegiance before Louis attacked the Dutch. Godolphin was with Louis in the field during the Franco-Dutch War but was unimpressed with his capabilities as a military commander.

In March 1679, Godolphin was appointed a member of the Privy Council and in September was promoted, along with Viscount Hyde (afterwards Earl of Rochester) and the Earl of Sunderland, to the chief management of affairs.

==Exclusion and revolution==
Although he voted for the Exclusion Bill in 1680, which, if successfully enacted, would have prevented the Catholic Duke of York from assuming the throne, Godolphin continued in office after the dismissal of Sunderland, and in September 1684, he was created Baron Godolphin of Rialton and succeeded Rochester as First Lord of the Treasury. After the accession of James II, he was made chamberlain to the queen, Mary of Modena, and, along with Rochester and Sunderland, enjoyed the king&#x27;s special confidence. In 1687 he was named commissioner of the treasury. Although Parliament had voted to grant James II £6,000,000, Godolphin was involved in the payment of approximately £125,000 to James II by Louis XIV in return for James&#x27;s support for Louis. The historian David Ogg wrote critically that &quot;James and his two ministers, Rochester and Godolphin, were prepared to barter the independence of England for a sum little more than a sixtieth part of that granted by the national legislature&quot;. However, secret subsidies had also been paid to Charles II in the past, and according to Antonia Fraser, their acceptance was not &quot;the national scandal it would be today&quot;. While the purpose of such funds was clearly to circumvent the control of Parliament over the monarch, &quot;Whig leaders [...] allowed themselves to receive similar payments&quot; from Louis XIV.

Godolphin was present at the birth of the Old Pretender, but during the ensuing controversy over whether or not the birth was genuine, he diplomatically stated that he had no useful information to contribute, as he claimed to have been too far from the bed to see anything. He was one of the council of five appointed by James II to represent him in London when James left the capital to lead his army after William of Orange and his forces invaded England. Afterwards, he was appointed a commissioner to negotiate with the prince, along with Lord Halifax and Lord Nottingham. On the accession of William III, Godolphin obtained only the third seat at the treasury board, but was still in control of affairs. He retired in March 1690, but was recalled in November and appointed First Lord of the Treasury once again.

==Career under William III and Queen Anne==
While holding office under William III, for several years Godolphin continued, in conjunction with John Churchill (the future Duke of Marlborough), a secret correspondence with James II, and is said to have disclosed to James intelligence regarding the intended expedition against Brest during the Nine Years War. Godolphin was a Tory by inheritance, and was thought to have a romantic admiration for the wife of James II. After Fenwick&#x27;s confession in 1696 regarding the attempted assassination of William III, Godolphin, who was compromised, tendered his resignation, but when the Tories came into power in 1700, he was again appointed First Lord of the Treasury. Though not technically a favourite with Queen Anne, he was after her accession appointed Lord Treasurer on the strong recommendation of Marlborough, and he retained the office for eight years. Sarah Churchill later wrote that if Anne came to learn anything about politics and statecraft, it was entirely from Godolphin&#x27;s mentoring, and he eventually became &quot;so integral a part of Anne&#x27;s coterie that she and Sarah dubbed him with an alias of his own, so that in their parlance he went by, and answered to, the name of Mr Montgomery.&quot; In 1704, he was also made a Knight of the Garter, and in December 1706, he was created Viscount Rialton and Earl of Godolphin.

Though a Tory, he had an active share in the intrigues that gradually led to the predominance of the Whigs in alliance with Marlborough: the two were nicknamed &quot;the Duumvirs&quot;. The influence of the Marlboroughs with the queen was, however, gradually supplanted by that of Abigail Masham and Robert Harley (later Earl of Oxford), and with the fortunes of the Marlboroughs, those of Godolphin were indissolubly united. The Queen initially relied heavily on his guidance, but relations became strained. Eventually, when he threatened to resign, she said coldly, &quot;Do as you please... there are many to take your place&quot;. The services of both Marlborough and Godolphin were so appreciated by the nation that for a time, they regarded the loss of the queen&#x27;s favour with indifference and even in 1708 to procure the expulsion of Harley from office. However, after the High Tory reaction to the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, who had abused Godolphin under the name of Volpone, Anne made use of the opportunity to get rid of Marlborough by abruptly dismissing Godolphin from office on 7 August 1710 in tones as cold and ungrateful as those that she later used with Marlborough. Godolphin died two years later and his estate was worth more than £12,000. He is buried in the south aisle of the nave of Westminster Abbey. On the wall is a bust of him by the sculptor Francis Bird.

==Marriage and succession==
On 16 May 1675, Godolphin married Margaret Blagge, daughter of Thomas Blagge, the pious lady whose life was written by John Evelyn in his book &quot;The Life of Mrs Godolphin&quot;. She died in childbirth in 1678 bearing his only son, and Godolphin never remarried. Margaret is buried at Breage, Cornwall, the spot being marked by a small brass floor plaque commissioned by the Duke of Leeds. Progeny:
*Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin (1678–1766)

==Legacy==

The Whig historian Lord Macaulay said of Godolphin in 1848:

He was laborious, clear-headed, and profoundly versed in the details of finance. Every government, therefore, found him an useful servant; and there was nothing in his opinions or in his character which could prevent him from serving any government. &quot;Sidney Godolphin,&quot; said Charles, &quot;is never in the way, and never out of the way.&quot; This pointed remark goes far to explain Godolphin&#x27;s extraordinary success in life. He acted at different times with both the great political parties; but he never shared in the passions of either. Like most men of cautious tempers and prosperous fortunes, he had a strong disposition to support whatever existed. He disliked revolutions, and, for the same reason for which he disliked revolutions, he disliked counter-revolutions. His deportment was remarkably grave and reserved, but his personal tastes were low and frivolous; and most of the time which he could save from public business was spent in racing, cardplaying, and cockfighting.

In the opinion of Julian Hoppit, Godolphin &quot;tirelessly oversaw the dramatic expansion of key areas of the State, providing an element of integrity, continuity, and predictability in a very uncertain environment. He was in a very real sense Marlborough&#x27;s partner and together the duumvirs oversaw the glory days of the War of the Spanish Succession. In a very real sense Marlborough&#x27;s dismissal and Godolphin&#x27;s death the following year marked the end of an era&quot;. Roy Sundstrom asserted that Godolphin is an important figure in the history of England:

[…] first he raised the money required to blunt French hegemony in Europe and thus preserved the British constitution and the protestant monarchy; second he was instrumental in planning the military and diplomatic strategy that ultimately defeated Louis XIV; third, as lord high treasurer, he worked to make the Treasury more efficient and attempted to weed out corruption—the Treasury as he left it served England well for the remainder of the eighteenth century; fourth he was instrumental in negotiating and passing the Act of Union with Scotland which created the united kingdom of Great Britain; and fifth he negotiated the creation of a unified East India Company, which would be instrumental in establishing British rule in India.

<text>Captain Gaspar de Portolá y Rovira (January 1, 1716 – October 10, 1786) was a Spanish Army officer and colonial administrator who served as the first governor of the Californias from 1767 to 1770. Born in Catalonia into an aristocratic family, he is best known for leading the Portolá expedition into California, which laid the foundations of Spanish rule in the region Californian cities like San Diego and Monterey, and bestowed names to geographic features throughout California, many of which are still in use.

==Early life==
Gaspar de Portolá y Rovira was born on January 1, 1716 in Os de Balaguer, Catalonia, into a family of minor Spanish nobility. After he came of age, Portolá joined the Spanish Army, being commissioned as an ensign in 1734 and a lieutenant in 1743. He saw service in Italy during the War of the Austrian Succession and participated in the Spanish invasion of Portugal during the Fantastic War. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Spanish Empire, Portolá was tasked with removing the Jesuits from Spanish missions in Baja California. He then ensured the missions were turned over to the Franciscans and later to the Dominicans.

==Expedition to Las Californias==
Spain was driven to establish missions and other outposts on the Pacific Coast north of the Baja California Peninsula by fears that the territory would be claimed by foreign powers, in addition to its Catholic proselytizing mission and need for additional sources of income. The British, who had established several colonies on the East Coast of North America, had also sent explorers into the Pacific. Russian fur hunters were pressing east from Siberia across the Bering Strait into the Aleutian Islands and beyond. 

Dispatches of January 23, 1768, exchanged between King Carlos and the viceroy, set the wheels in motion to extend Spain&#x27;s control up the Pacific Coast and establish colonies and missions at San Diego Bay and Monterey Bay, which had been discovered and described in reports by earlier explorers Juan Cabrillo and Sebastián Vizcaíno. Vizcaíno had mapped the California coastline as far north as Monterey in 1602, but no significant Spanish settlement or even trading station had followed because those earlier explorations had failed to find a good harbor that the Spanish could have used for their long-standing Pacific maritime trade between Asia and Mexico: Monterey Bay, sighted by both Cabrillo and Vizcaíno, was exposed to rough currents and winds.

In May 1768, the Spanish Visitor General, José de Gálvez, began to organize an expedition, by sea and by land. Portolá was created &quot;Governor of the Californias&quot; and given overall command. Junípero Serra, leader of the expedition&#x27;s Franciscan missionaries, took command of spiritual matters. Sea and land detachments were to meet at San Diego Bay. 

The first ship, the &quot;San Carlos&quot;, sailed from La Paz on January 10, 1769 and a second, the &quot;San Antonio&quot; sailed from Cabo San Lucas on February 15. At the same time, the various elements of the land parties began to move
north from Loreto, Baja California Sur. The land expedition was assembled at Velicatá, where Serra established his first new mission. From there, Portolá&#x27;s plan called for splitting the land expedition in two. The lead group, charged with building a wagon trail and pacifying the natives, was led by Captain Fernando Rivera y Moncada, and departed from Velicatá on March 24. With Rivera was the priest Juan Crespí, diarist for the Franciscans. The expedition led by Portolá, which included Junípero Serra (the President of the Missions), along with a combination of missionaries, settlers, and leather-jacket soldiers, including José Raimundo Carrillo, left Velicatá on May 15. Junípero Serra founded two more missions during the expedition: San Diego de Alcalá on July 16, 1769 and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on June 3, 1770.

Rivera reached the site of present-day San Diego in May, established a camp in the area that is now Old Town and awaited the arrival of the others. Because of an error by Vizcaíno in determining the latitude of the San Diego Harbor, the ships passed by it and landed too far north before finding their way back. The &quot;San Antonio&quot; arrived on April 11 and the &quot;San Carlos&quot;, the first ship to leave La Paz, having met with fierce winds and storms on the journey, arrived on April 29. A third vessel was to follow with supplies, but it was probably lost at sea. The land expedition of Portolá arrived on June 29. After their arduous journeys, most of the men aboard ship were ill, chiefly from scurvy, and many had died. Out of a total of 219 who left Baja California, little more than 100 now survived.

Eager to press on to Monterey Bay, Portolá and his expedition, consisting of Juan Crespí, 63 leather-jacket soldiers and 100 mules loaded down with provisions, headed north on July 14, 1769, marching two to four leagues (1 league = 2.6 miles) a day. The expedition recorded an earthquake on July 28 at the Santa Ana River. On July 29 they reached the site of present-day Fullerton, California at Hillcrest Park. On July 30, the expedition crossed the Puente Hills at a pass in La Habra (North Harbor Boulevard). They moved north-west to the San Gabriel River (near El Monte) where they built a bridge to cross over. This bridge (&#x27;La Puente&#x27; in Crespi&#x27;s diary) is remembered in the name of today&#x27;s nearby city of La Puente. They arrived in what is now Los Angeles on August 2 (where the Los Angeles River and Arroyo Seco river meet). The following day, they marched out the Indian trail that would one day become Wilshire Boulevard to the present site of Santa Monica. Winding around to the area of later Saugus, now part of Santa Clarita, they reached the area to become Santa Barbara on August 19, and the present-day San Simeon area on September 13. Unable to remain on the coast due to the steep, difficult terrain, the party turned inland. They marched through the San Antonio Valley and on October 1, Portolá&#x27;s party emerged from the Santa Lucia Mountains and reached the mouth of the Salinas River.

After a march of some from San Diego and about from Velicatá, they had reached the bay they were seeking. But they failed to discern the coastline&#x27;s semi-circular shape, described by Vizcaíno as round like an &quot;O&quot;, even though members of the party had twice marched along its beach. Having failed to find their goal, they marched on north and reached the area at the north end of the bay, where Crespí named a creek Santa Cruz on October 18. Pushing on, they reached a creek in the present-day town of Pacifica on October 31.

On November 4, having crossed the low coastal mountain range above the creek, the party was stunned to catch a glimpse of the enormous San Francisco Bay from the mountain range, as the bay was previously unknown to the Spanish. This sighting was crucial to the later settlement of California because unlike Monterey Bay, it was surrounded by land on all sides except the Golden Gate, and thus it was not exposed to rough ocean currents as was Monterey Bay, which had been known to the Spanish since Cabrillo&#x27;s exploration in the sixteenth century. Despite the earlier explorations of Cabrillo and Vizcaíno, and despite two centuries of Spanish sailing the Pacific for trade between Asia and Mexico, the San Francisco Bay had been missed because of the fog that frequently shrouded its entrance. If the San Francisco Bay had been discovered earlier, the region surrounding would have been settled by the Spanish earlier since it would have provided a safe, convenient harbor for Spain&#x27;s Pacific maritime trade.

Portolá&#x27;s party then headed back to San Diego, exploring and naming many localities in the region south of what eventually became known as the Golden Gate. Surviving on mule meat for most of the journey, they arrived on January 24, 1770.

On their way past Monterey Bay, they again failed to recognize it as the same bay that Vizcaíno had described in 1602.

==Second expedition==
One of Portolá&#x27;s officers, Captain Vicente Vila, convinced him that he had actually been exactly on the Bay of Monterey when he placed his second cross at what later became Pacific Grove. After replenishing supplies at San Diego, Portolá and Serra decided on a joint expedition by land and sea to again search for the bay and establish a colony if they were successful. The &quot;San Antonio&quot; sailed on April 16, 1770. On board were Serra, Miguel Costansó, military engineer and cartographer, and Doctor Pedro Prat, army surgeon, along with a cargo of supplies for the new mission at Monterey. On April 17, after mustering what forces he could, Portolá&#x27;s land expedition, which included lieutenant Pedro Fages, 12 Spanish volunteers, seven leather-jacket soldiers, five Baja California Indians, two muleteers, and Juan Crespí serving as the expedition&#x27;s chaplain, again marched north.

The expedition followed the same route they had the previous winter while returning to San Diego. After 36 days on the road, with only two days of rest, Portolá arrived at his second cross on May 24, 1770. He then saw that on a clear day and from a certain point of view the round harbor assumed the proportions described by the earlier enthusiastic explorers. Having recognized the bay, a Mass was conducted near the oak tree that the Carmelite missionaries with Vizcaíno had worshiped under in 1603, and possession was officially taken. On June 3, 1770, they laid the beginnings of the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo and founded the Presidio of Monterey.

==Later life==
Governor Portolá&#x27;s task was finished. He then left Captain Pedro Fages in charge, and on June 9 he sailed for San Blas, never to return to Upper California. In 1776, Portolá was appointed the governor of Puebla. After the appointment of his successor in 1784, he was advanced money for expenses and returned to Spain, where he served as commander of the &quot;Numancia&quot; cavalry dragoon regiment. On February 7, 1786 he was appointed King&#x27;s Lieutenant for the strongholds and castles of Lleida. He died that same year, in October.

==Memorials==
A 9 foot (2.7 m) statue in Pacifica, California was sculpted by the Catalan sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs and his associate, Francesc Carulla. It was given to the people of California by the Catalan government in 1988. The statue was taken down on January 18, 2024, after years of complaint that the statue was honoring European colonization in the area. A ten-foot high oil-on-canvas portrait of Portolá by Albert Herter in 1929 hangs in the Los Angeles Central Library&#x27;s History Room.

The city of Portola in Plumas County, the town of Portola Valley in San Mateo County, and the Portola neighborhood of San Francisco were named after Portolà.

A number of schools in California were also named after him, including Portola Hills Elementary School in Portola Hills, Portola Elementary School in San Bruno, Gaspar de Portola Middle School in Tierrasanta, Portola Middle School in Tarzana, Portola Middle School in Orange, &amp; Portola High School in Irvine. The school in Orange is close to the spot where the expedition crossed the Santa Ana River, and the school has a 60-foot mural depicting the Portolà Expedition.

Portola Parkway running through Irvine and Lake Forest (though not connected as of 2018), was also named after Portolà. It is said that Portolà used the same route Portola Parkway now runs across. Portola Drive, which runs parallel to and near the Monterey Bay shoreline, is the main street of the Pleasure Point area of Santa Cruz County. Portola Avenue is also a north-south street located in Palm Desert in the Coachella Valley.

<doc id="310561" wikidata="Q1557627" url="?curid=310561" title="State of Franklin">
<text>The State of Franklin (also the Free Republic of Franklin, Lost State of Franklin, or the State of Frankland) was an unrecognized proposed state located in present-day East Tennessee, in the United States. Franklin was created in 1784 from part of the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains that had been offered by North Carolina as a cession to Congress to help pay off debts related to the American War for Independence. It was founded with the intent of becoming the 14th state of the new United States.

Franklin&#x27;s first capital was Jonesborough. After the summer of 1787, the government of Franklin (which was by then based in Greeneville), ruled as a &quot;parallel government&quot; running alongside (but not harmoniously with) a re-established North Carolina bureaucracy. Franklin was never admitted into the union. The &quot;extra-legal&quot; state existed for only about four and a half years, ostensibly as a republic, after which North Carolina reassumed full control of the area.

The creation of Franklin is novel, in that it resulted from both a cession (an offering from North Carolina to Congress) and a secession (seceding from North Carolina, when its offer to Congress was not acted upon and the original cession was rescinded).

If Franklin had become a state, its boundaries would have included the 12 modern Tennessee counties of Johnson, Carter, Sullivan, Washington, Greene, Hawkins, Unicoi, Cocke, Hamblen, Jefferson, Sevier, and Blount. With an approximate total area of 6,400 square miles, Franklin would rank as the 4th smallest state by area in the Union, ahead of Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island. Its population, estimated at 930,000 based on the current populations of these counties, would place it as the 6th smallest state by population, ahead of South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming.

== Concept ==
The concept of a new western state came from Arthur Campbell of Washington County, Virginia, and John Sevier. They believed the Overmountain towns should be admitted to the United States as a separate state. They differed, however, on the details of such a state, although John Sevier (in a letter written in 1782) acknowledged Campbell&#x27;s leadership on the issue. Campbell&#x27;s proposed state would have included southwestern Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and parts of Kentucky, Georgia, and Alabama. Sevier favored a more limited state, that being the eastern section of the old Washington District, which was then part of North Carolina.

Although many of the frontiersmen supported the idea, Campbell&#x27;s calls for the creation of an independent state carved out of parts of Virginia territory caused Virginia governor and Kentucky land speculator Patrick Henry—who opposed a loss of territory for the state—to pass a law that forbade anyone to attempt to create a new state from Virginia by the cession of state territory. After Virginia Gov. Henry stopped Campbell, Sevier and his followers renamed their proposed state Franklin and sought support for their cause from Benjamin Franklin. The Frankland movement had little success on the Kentucky frontier, as settlers there wanted their own state (which they achieved in 1792).

== Cession and rescission ==

===Franklin&#x27;s support===
The United States Congress was heavily in debt at the close of the American War for Independence. In April 1784, the state of North Carolina voted &quot;to give Congress the lying between the Allegheny Mountains&quot; (as the entire Appalachian range was then called) &quot;and the Mississippi River&quot; to help offset its war debts. This area was a large part of what had been the Washington District (usually referred to simply as the &quot;Western Counties&quot;). These western counties had originally been acquired by lease from the Overhill Cherokee, out of which the Watauga Republic had arisen.

The North Carolina cession to the federal government had a stipulation that Congress would have to accept responsibility for the area within two years, which, for various reasons, it was reluctant to do. The cession effectively left the western settlements of North Carolina alone in dealing with the Cherokee of the area, many of whom had not yet made peace with the new nation. These developments were not welcomed by the frontiersmen, who had pushed even further westward, gaining a foothold on the western Cumberland River at Fort Nashborough (now Nashville), or the Overmountain Men, many of whom had settled in the area during the days of the old Watauga Republic. Inhabitants of the region feared that the cash-starved federal Congress might even be desperate enough to sell the frontier territory to a competing foreign power (such as France or Spain).

=== North Carolina&#x27;s reluctance ===
A few months later, a newly elected North Carolina Legislature re-evaluated the situation. Realizing the land could not at that time be used for its intended purpose of paying the debts of Congress and weighing the perceived economic loss of potential real estate opportunities, it rescinded the offer of cession and reasserted its claim to the remote western district. The North Carolina lawmakers ordered judges to hold court in the western counties and arranged to enroll a brigade of soldiers for defense, appointing John Sevier to form it.

== Secessionist movement ==
Rapidly increasing dissatisfaction with North Carolina&#x27;s governance led to the frontiersmen&#x27;s calls to establish a separate, secure, and independent state. On August 23, 1784, delegates from the North Carolina counties of Washington (which at the time included present-day Carter County), Sullivan, Spencer (now Hawkins County) and Greene—all of which are in present-day Tennessee—convened in the town of Jonesborough. There, they declared the lands to be independent of the State of North Carolina.

Leaders were duly elected. John Sevier reluctantly became governor; Landon Carter, speaker of the Senate; William Cage, first speaker of the House of Representatives; and David Campbell, judge of the Superior Court. Thomas Talbot served as Senate clerk, while Thomas Chapman served as clerk of the House. The delegates were called to a constitutional convention held at Jonesborough in December of that year. There, they drafted a constitution that excluded lawyers, doctors, and preachers as candidates for election to the legislature. The constitution was defeated in referendum. Afterward, the area continued to operate under tenets of the North Carolina state constitution.

== Attempt at statehood ==
On May 16, 1785, a delegation submitted a petition for statehood to Congress. Eventually, seven states voted to admit what would have been the 14th federal state under the proposed name of &quot;Frankland&quot;. This was, however, less than the two-thirds majority required under the Articles of Confederation to add additional states to the confederation. The following month, the Franklin government convened to address their options and to replace the vacancy at speaker of the House, to which position they elected Joseph Hardin. In an attempt to curry favor for their cause, delegation leaders changed the &quot;official&quot; name of the area to &quot;Franklin&quot; (ostensibly after Benjamin Franklin). Sevier even tried to persuade Franklin to support their cause by letter, but he declined, writing:
== Independent republic ==

Franklin, still at odds with North Carolina over taxation, protection, and other issues, began operating as a &quot;de facto&quot; independent republic after the failed statehood attempt. Greeneville was declared the new capital. The government had previously been assembling at Jonesborough, only blocks away from the North Carolina-backed rival seat of government. The first legislature met in Greeneville in December 1785. The delegates adopted a permanent constitution, known as the Holston Constitution, which was modeled closely upon that of North Carolina. John Sevier also proposed to commission a Franklin state flag, but it was never designed.

Franklin opened courts, incorporated and annexed five new counties (see map below), and fixed taxes and officers&#x27; salaries. Barter became the economic system &quot;de jure&quot;, with anything in common use among the people allowed in payment to settle debts, including corn, cotton, tobacco, apple brandy, and skins. (Sevier was often paid in deer hides.) Federal or foreign currencies were accepted. All citizens were granted a two-year reprieve on paying taxes, but the lack of hard currency and economic infrastructure slowed development and often created confusion.
===Relations with Native Americans===
The new legislature made peace treaties with the Native American tribes in the area (with few exceptions, the most notable being the Chickamauga Cherokee). The Cherokee claim to sovereignty over much of the area of southern Franklin, though already occupied by Whites, was maintained at the 1785 Treaty of Hopewell with the federal government. In 1786, Samuel Wear helped negotiate the competing Treaty of Coyatee on behalf of the State of Franklin. Coyatee re-affirmed the 1785 Treaty of Dumplin Creek, which the republic had secured from the Cherokee, and which Dragging Canoe&#x27;s Chickamauga faction had refused to recognize. The new treaty extended the area for White settlement as far south as the Little Tennessee River, along which the main Overhill Cherokee towns were located. The Cherokee did not formally relinquish their claim to this territory to the U.S. until the July 1791 Treaty of Holston and even then, hostilities continued in the area for years afterward.

===Drawn-out end===
The small state began its demise in 1786, with several key residents and supporters of Franklin withdrawing their support in favor of a newly reinterested North Carolina. Until this point, Franklin had not had the benefit of either the federal army or the North Carolina militia. In late 1786, North Carolina offered to waive all back taxes if Franklin would reunite with its government. When this offer was popularly rejected in 1787, North Carolina moved in with troops under the leadership of Col. John Tipton and re-established its own courts, jails, and government at Jonesborough. The two rival administrations now competed side-by-side.

====Battle of Franklin====
In 1787, the &quot;Franklinites&quot; continued to expand their territory westward toward the Cumberland Mountains by forcibly stealing land from the Native American populations. The frontier shifted back and forth often throughout the Cherokee–American wars. The September 1787 meeting of the Franklin legislature, however, was its last.

At the end of 1787, loyalties were divided among the area&#x27;s residents and came to a head in early February 1788. Jonathan Pugh, the North Carolina sheriff of Washington County, was ordered by the county court to seize any property of Sevier&#x27;s to settle tax debts North Carolina contended were owed to them. The property seized included several slaves, who were brought to Tipton&#x27;s home and secured in his underground kitchen. On February 27, Governor Sevier arrived at the Tipton house leading a force numbering more than 100 men. During a heavy snowstorm in the early morning of February 29, Colonel George Maxwell arrived with a force equivalent to Sevier&#x27;s to reinforce Tipton. After 10 minutes of skirmishing, Sevier and his force withdrew to Jonesborough. A number of men were captured or wounded on both sides, and three men were killed.

===Frontier intrigues===
In late March 1788, the Chickamauga, Chickasaw, and other tribes collectively began to attack American frontier settlements in Franklin. A desperate Sevier sought a loan from the Spanish government. With help from James White (who was later found to be a paid agent of Spain), he attempted to place Franklin under Spanish rule. Opposed to any foreign nation gaining a foothold in Franklin, North Carolina officials arrested Sevier in August 1788. Sevier&#x27;s supporters quickly freed him from the local jail and retreated to &quot;Lesser Franklin&quot;. In February 1789, Sevier and the last holdouts of the &quot;Lost State&quot; swore oaths of allegiance to North Carolina after turning themselves in. North Carolina sent their militia to aid in driving out the Cherokee and Chickasaw.

===Lesser Franklin===
After the dissolution of the State of Franklin in February 1789, continued support of the separate state movement was confined largely to Sevier County, specifically in the country south of the French Broad River. The people there realized that the only entity recognizing title to their land holdings had been Franklin. Both North Carolina and the federal (Confederation) government supported the Cherokee claims as set forth in the Treaty of Hopewell, and considered settlers in the area &quot;squatters&quot;. This led to the formation of a &quot;Lesser Franklin&quot; government, with Articles of Association similar to the earlier Watauga Constitution. In 1789, these articles were adopted at Newell&#x27;s Station, which served as the seat of government for the wider area of Lesser Franklin, including all the settled country south of the French Broad.

The Lesser Franklin government finally ended in 1791, when Governor William Blount, of the newly formed Southwest Territory, met the Cherokee chieftains on the site of the future Knoxville, and they made the Treaty of Holston. The Overhill Cherokee now acknowledged the authority of the United States government, and ceded to the federal government all of their lands south of the French Broad, almost as far as the Little Tennessee River.

== Subsequent status ==
By early 1789, the government of the State of Franklin outside of Lesser Franklin had collapsed entirely and the territory was firmly back under the control of North Carolina. Soon thereafter, North Carolina once again ceded the area to the federal government to form the Southwest Territory, the precursor to the State of Tennessee. Sevier was elected in 1790 to the US Congress to represent the territory, and became Tennessee&#x27;s first governor, in 1796. Col. John Tipton signed the Tennessee Constitution as the representative from Washington County.

== Legacy ==
The Washington County farm of Col. John Tipton, where the 1788 Battle of Franklin was fought, has been preserved by the State of Tennessee as the Tipton-Haynes State Historic Site in southeastern Johnson City, Tennessee.

Samuel Tipton, a son of Col. John Tipton, donated land for a town to be located along the east side of the Doe River near its confluence with the Watauga River in what was then known as Wayne County, and the town was named in his honor as Tiptonville (not to be confused with present-day Tiptonville, in West Tennessee). The losers of the Battle of Franklin (1788) later regained political power and renamed Wayne County as Carter County (after the former State of Franklin Senate Speaker Landon Carter), and also renamed Tiptonville as Elizabethton (after the wife of Landon Carter, Elizabeth Carter) when Tennessee was first admitted to the Union in 1796 and John Sevier became the first governor of Tennessee.

The Franklin area also played a role in the Southern Unionist East Tennessee Convention. Throughout the first half of the 19th century, East Tennessee was frequently at odds with Tennessee&#x27;s two other grand divisions, Middle Tennessee and West Tennessee. Many East Tennesseans felt the state legislature showed persistent favoritism toward the other two divisions, especially over funding for internal improvements. In the early 1840s, several East Tennessee leaders, among them Congressman (and future President) Andrew Johnson, led a movement to form a separate state in East Tennessee known as &quot;Frankland&quot;. Though this movement was unsuccessful, the idea that East Tennessee should be a separate state periodically resurfaced over the subsequent two decades.

Many businesses in the State of Franklin use that name to keep the legacy alive, such as the &quot;State of Franklin Bank&quot;, based in Johnson City, Tennessee.

One of the main thoroughfares in Johnson City is named &quot;State of Franklin Road&quot; and passes by East Tennessee State University.

In law-school examinations in the U.S., a fictional &quot;State of Franklin&quot; is used as a placeholder name for a generic state, often the one in which the property of Blackacre is located. This way, variations in existing state law do not complicate the theoretical legal issues arising from the property disputes. By convention, Blackacre is located in Acre County, Franklin.

The combined present-day (as of 2015 census) population of the counties that would have made up the State of Franklin is 540,000, which would have made the state have about 40,000 people fewer than Wyoming, the current least-populous state.

<doc id="310563" wikidata="Q904173" url="?curid=310563" title="Derian Hatcher">
<text>Derian John Hatcher (born June 4, 1972) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Minnesota North Stars, Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings, and Philadelphia Flyers. He is the current owner of the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL).

He is the younger brother of former NHL player Kevin Hatcher, with whom he was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame on October 21, 2010. In 2014, Hatcher and David Legwand, a fellow OHL alumnus, NHL player and Michigan native, purchased and became co-owners of the Sarnia Sting, with Hatcher serving as head coach from 2015 to 2020.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Hatcher played in the 1985 and 1986 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with the Detroit Compuware minor ice hockey team.

Hatcher was known as a physical defenseman and a strong bodychecker and used his intimidating size to good effect. He was drafted in the 1st round as the eighth overall selection by the Minnesota North Stars in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft and scored in his NHL debut game on October 12, 1991. Hatcher played for the North Stars and went with them when they moved to Dallas in 1993.

Hatcher played another ten years for the Dallas Stars, collecting 71 goals, 223 assists, 1,380 penalty minutes, and captained the Stars to the Stanley Cup in 1999. In doing so, he became the first American-born captain to win the Stanley Cup. In July 2003, Hatcher signed with the Detroit Red Wings on a five-year, $30 million contract. A knee injury in just the third game of the season forced Hatcher to miss most of the year, playing in just 15 regular season games with the Red Wings.

In 2004, due to the cancellation of the NHL season, Hatcher, along with fellow Detroit Red Wings teammates Chris Chelios and Kris Draper, decided to play minor league hockey with the Motor City Mechanics based out of Fraser, Michigan.

On August 2, 2005, Hatcher signed with the Philadelphia Flyers after his contract with Detroit was bought out due to the new salary cap.

On January 29, 2006, Hatcher was named interim captain of the Flyers. He served as captain for the rest of the 2005–06 season due to the absence of injured captain Keith Primeau. Hatcher has also served as an alternate captain for the Flyers.

Suffering from a right knee injury, he missed the entire 2008–09 NHL season. Hatcher later returned as a &quot;co-coach&quot; for the playoffs. After having replacement surgery on the same knee on June 1, 2009, Hatcher said that he would most likely not return to playing hockey. On June 15, 2009, Hatcher formally announced his retirement from the NHL, done so with the Dallas Stars. He remained in the Flyers organization as a player development coach, taking a job vacated by another former Flyer defenseman and captain, Éric Desjardins, who resigned to pursue business interests. Hatcher is the second longest-serving captain in the history of the Dallas Stars and their predecessor, the Minnesota North Stars.

==Awards==
*Played in NHL All-Star Game - 1997
*1999 Stanley Cup champion
*NHL Second All-Star Team - 2003
*Inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame - 2010
==Personal life==
Hatcher and his brother Kevin, also a former NHL player, previously owned a bar/restaurant in Utica, Michigan.

In 2015, Hatcher, along with David Legwand, purchased the OHL&#x27;s Sarnia Sting. Hatcher served as head coach of the team, with Legwand as an assistant coach, from 2015 to 2021.

<doc id="310564" wikidata="Q686498" url="?curid=310564" title="Doc (computing)">
<text>.doc (an abbreviation of &quot;document&quot;) is a filename extension used for word processing documents stored on Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary Microsoft Word Binary File Format; it was the primary format for Microsoft Word until the 2007 version replaced it with Office Open XML codice_1 files. Microsoft has used the extension since 1983.

==Overview==

Binary DOC files often contain more text formatting information (as well as scripts and undo information) than some other document file formats like Rich Text Format and Hypertext Markup Language, but are usually less widely compatible.

The DOC files created with Microsoft Word versions differ: Word for Windows 1.0 and 2.0 uses a format that was changed in the following Word 6.0 and 95 (&quot;7.0&quot;) releases. DOC was changed once again into an OLE and CFBF-based format used from Word 97 (&quot;8.0&quot;) to 2003 (&quot;11.0&quot;). Word for MS-DOS used its own specific DOC format.

In order to allow users of Word 6.0 and Word 95 to be able to open and read documents created in the newer (97–2003) format, Microsoft released the downloadable Word 97 Import Converter.

In Microsoft Word 2007 and later, the binary file format was replaced as the default format by the Office Open XML (codice_1) format, though Microsoft Word can still produce and open DOC files. Microsoft released the Office Compatibility Pack allowing users of Word 2003, 2002, 2000 and 97 to open the new format as well as edit and save them. Modern versions of Word can also open documents in the pre-97 DOC formats, but should be manually enabled in the File Block Settings.

== Application support ==

The DOC format is native to Microsoft Word. Other word processors, such as OpenOffice.org Writer, IBM Lotus Symphony, Apple Pages and AbiWord, can also create and read DOC files, although with some limitations. Command line programs for Unix-like operating systems that can convert files from the DOC format to plain text or other standard formats include the wv library, which itself is used directly by AbiWord.

== Specification ==
Because the DOC file format was a closed specification for many years, inconsistent handling of the format persists and may cause some loss of formatting information when handling the same file with multiple word processing programs. Some specifications for Microsoft Office 97 binary file formats were published in 1997 under a restrictive license, but these specifications were removed from online download in 1999. Specifications of later versions of Microsoft Office binary file formats were not publicly available. The DOC format specification was available from Microsoft on request since 2006 under restrictive RAND-Z terms until February 2008. Sun Microsystems and OpenOffice.org reverse engineered the file format. On February 15, 2008, Microsoft released a .DOC format specification under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise. However, this specification does not describe all of the features used by DOC format and reverse engineered work remains necessary. Since 2008 the specification has been updated several times; the latest change was made in May 2022.

The format used in earlier, pre-97 (&quot;1.0&quot; 1989 through &quot;7.0&quot; 1995) versions of Word are less known, but both OpenOffice and LibreOffice contain open-source code for reading these formats. The format is probably related to the &quot;Stream&quot; format found in similar Excel versions. Word 95 also seems to have an OLE-wrapped form.

== Other .doc file formats ==
Some historical documentations may use the DOC filename extension for plain-text files, indicating documentation for software or hardware. The DOC filename extension was also used during the 1980s by WordPerfect for its proprietary format.

&quot;DOC&quot; is sometimes used by users of Palm OS as shorthand for PalmDoc, an unrelated format (commonly using PDB filename extension) used to encode text files such as ebooks.

<doc id="310566" wikidata="Q4894515" url="?curid=310566" title="Bernie Ward">
<text>Bernard Vincent Ward (born April 5, 1951) is an American former radio personality whose career ran from 1985 to 2007. Formerly a radio talk show host with KGO 810 AM in San Francisco, California, Ward, once billed by KGO as &quot;The Lion of the Left&quot; and &quot;unabashedly liberal,&quot; was the host of the daily news talk program, &quot;The Bernie Ward Show,&quot; and the three-hour program, &quot;GodTalk&quot;, on Sunday mornings.

In December 2007, Ward was dismissed from KGO following his federal grand jury child pornography indictment. Subsequently, in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors, Ward admitted to a single felony charge of online distribution of child pornography and signed an admission of distributing between 15 and 150 images via email. He consequently served a six-year prison sentence, and was released in 2014.

==Biography==
Bernie Ward was born in San Francisco, California, where he attended Holy Name Grammar School, St. Ignatius High School, and the University of San Francisco. He taught for one year (1973-1974) at St. Victor Catholic elementary school in San Jose, California. He then studied for three years at the Franciscan School of Theology in Berkeley, obtaining a Theology degree in 1977. He was ordained to the Catholic priesthood with the Missionaries of the Precious Blood the same year, but left the priesthood after two years.

Ward later taught theology at Cardinal Newman High School in Santa Rosa, California and its sister school, Ursuline High School. At Ursuline in 1978, allegations of Ward&#x27;s sexual misconduct first began to surface. Ward also taught at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, California. In 1981, he relocated to Washington, D.C. where he taught marriage and sex education at the Georgetown Preparatory School, a private Jesuit Roman Catholic high school, while his wife attended medical school. Ward later worked for then-Representative Barbara Boxer from 1982 to 1985.

===Radio talk show host===
Ward&#x27;s employment at KGO (AM) began in 1985 where he served as a fill-in talk show host, a general-assignment reporter, and later as a political talk show host starting in 1992. As a reporter, where Jerry Jay Carroll of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted on October 25, 1995, that it had become a ritual for the mayor at that time, Art Agnos, to denounce him for lies at the beginning of every news conference. Ward also went on to host &quot;God Talk,&quot; a show on religion and related topics.

Briefly in 1996, Ward&#x27;s talk show was nationally syndicated until his ratings declined. His show&#x27;s ratings began to improve in 1997 in Ward&#x27;s core demographic group (women ages 25 to 54) as a result of his more lenient views on topics such as child-rearing and ethics. On October 5, 1997, a rumor that KGO was discontinuing Ward&#x27;s contract effective at the end of the month was published by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. In protest, supporters of his show flooded the KGO studios with canned food donations, continuing a seven-year Thanksgiving fundraising drive started by Ward that had netted more than $1 million in donations shared by the St. Anthony Foundation and two other area charities. The protest culminated in a noontime rally staged in front of the KGO studios. KGO management reversed their decision and renewed Ward&#x27;s contract.

On December 31, 2007, Ward was fired from KGO because of his indictment on child pornography charges.

===Child pornography conviction===
On September 20, 2007, Ward was indicted by a grand jury on two federal counts of Attempting to Distribute and one count of Receiving child pornography via the Internet from December 2004 to January 2005. The police investigation of Ward originated with a complaint from a Stanislaus County woman who was posing online as a dominatrix under the screenname &quot;Sexfairy2005&quot; and who had engaged in online chats with Ward. According to the police report, Ward sent pornographic images of children to the chat partner, which caused her to contact police. The police began collecting evidence with her help and continued chat sessions with Ward. In the chat logs, Ward also described sexual activity with his own children. Ward and his children both later told investigators that none of the activities described in the chats ever actually occurred, Ward contending it was just sexual fantasy talk.

In a statement, Ward&#x27;s attorney did not dispute engaging in the chats or transmitting the photos, but instead claimed Ward was role-playing with the dominatrix in part for research on a book about hypocrisy in America. Federal investigators could find no evidence that Ward was working on such a book. Ward&#x27;s attorney claimed that federal authorities found no illegal images on his computer, which they seized in early 2005. However, after police obtained a search warrant for Ward&#x27;s online account, they found about 100 images of child pornography in his AOL email account on AOL&#x27;s servers which had been opened and forwarded, with sexual activity involving children.

On May 8, 2008, Ward announced an agreement to plead guilty to one count of Distribution of Child Pornography in exchange for the dropping of two additional counts of Possession and Distribution. In his plea agreement, Ward admits that he transmitted child pornography &quot;between 15 and 150 times.&quot; Under federal statute, Ward could have been sentenced to between five and 20 years in prison. The Department of Justice requested he be sentenced to nine years in prison.

On August 28, 2008, Judge Vaughn Walker sentenced Ward to seven years and three months in federal prison. Judge Walker agreed to Ward&#x27;s request that he be allowed to serve his time in the Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc, to which the U.S. Attorney raised no objection. Judge Walker commented that Ward&#x27;s alleged sexual misconduct while serving as a priest may go to character, but that the events happened too long ago to be relevant to his sentencing decision. He also said that he was not convinced sending Ward to prison is the best way to deal with an individual with such problems and that &quot;very little good has come out of all this.&quot; Ward told Judge Walker that he took full responsibility for his actions and said, &quot;I regret my actions, the harm they caused my family, my friends, and this community.&quot;

With good behavior, Ward&#x27;s sentence of 87 months was reduced by 15 percent, making him eligible for Supervised Release on December 19, 2014; there is no parole in the Federal system. On release from prison California&#x27;s Megan&#x27;s Law designated Ward a registered sex offender. For the remainder of his life Ward must in-person notify and register with local law enforcement about his residing or staying in its jurisdiction and locale.

Ward served his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc, a low-security federal prison in California. He was released on December 19, 2014.

==Personal beliefs==

===Religion===
On March 16, 1996, Ward discussed the confrontational tactics of the group ACT UP at a mosque, describing the group as a &quot;collection of non-partisan individuals committed to direct action to end AIDS.&quot; He stated that &quot;homosexuals had a good cause to make (against the Catholic Church),&quot; and claimed that the church encouraged homophobia and homophobic actions. The church denied this, stating that they did not encourage homophobia or resistance against homosexuals, but merely taught that homosexual sex, because it is outside a marriage between a man and a woman, was immoral.

On December 9, 1996, Ward stated that Christianity was &quot;morally superior&quot; to Judaism because it was based on unconditional forgiveness. He offered apologies on his radio show on December 17 and again on the following day, the first being dismissed by the Jewish Community Relations Council and the second being accepted. Ward insisted that he did not have a problem with any individual religion, only with fundamentalists. He later compared fundamentalist Orthodox Judaism with Nazism on September 12, 2001, but offered an apology the following day.

===Iraq war===
On September 30, 2002, Ward appeared on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and discussed possible military action against Iraq. He commented about Saddam Hussein: &quot;Hussein has not shown any threat to anyone&quot; and that the &quot;Kurds were prospering very well in the north even as al-Qaeda has used some of their connections with the Kurds.&quot;

===Causes===
He led a pledge drive for &quot;Thanksgiving Charities&quot; every year, which supported four charities in the San Francisco Bay Area: Sacred Heart Community Services in San Jose, St. Anthony&#x27;s Foundation in San Francisco, St. Vincent De Paul dining room in Oakland, and Fresh Start in Walnut Creek. The charity drive began in the late 1980s and raised over $4 million in the following decades. Ward was also a participant in the KGO leukemia cure-a-thon, which has raised over $13 million for research into leukemia and lymphoma causes.

==Recognition==
Ward received the Scripps Howard Award for Excellence in Journalism for his investigative journalism in a 10-part series, &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot;, which explored allegations of financial and sexual misconduct of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco. He has also won numerous national awards, such as an Associated Press award for coverage of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

<text>The Rodrigues giant day gecko (Phelsuma gigas) is an extinct species of day gecko. It lived on the island of Rodrigues and surrounding islands and typically dwelt on trees. The Rodrigues giant day gecko fed on insects and nectar, and, unlike most other day geckos, was apparently nocturnal in habit.

==Description==
&quot;Phelsuma gigas&quot; was one of the largest known geckos. It reached a total length of about . The body colour was grayish or grayish brown. On the back there were irregular black spottings. The tail had some striping and was charcoal- or dark grey-coloured. The tongue had a pink colour and the ventral side of the body was light yellow. The original collected specimens that were used to describe this species have been lost. Today, only a few portions of some skeletons remain.

==Behaviour==
Leguat described the species:
==Distribution==
This species inhabited Rodrigues and surrounding islands. &quot;P. gigas&quot; was last collected in 1842 on the offshore islet of Ile aux Fregates.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. gigas&quot; was an arboreal lizard living on trees within the forests of Rodrigues. &quot;P. gigas&quot; became extinct due to human-induced deforestation and predation by introduced cats and rats.

==Diet==
These day geckos fed on various insects and other invertebrates. As observed in other species of day geckos, it was assumed that &quot;P. gigas&quot; also liked to lick at soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

<doc id="310570" wikidata="Q431862" url="?curid=310570" title="Sabretooth (character)">
<text>Sabretooth is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, he first appeared in &quot;Iron Fist&quot; #14 (August 1977) and was initially depicted as a serial killer known as &quot;the Slasher&quot;, before being developed into a villain associated with the X-Men during the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; crossover in 1986. This portrayal of Sabretooth has endured as the archenemy of the superhero Wolverine.

In his comic book appearances, Sabretooth is the alias of Victor Creed, a psychopathic mutant with enhanced senses, razor-sharp claws, superhuman strength and reflexes, and regenerative healing abilities. There have been various possible accounts of the origin of Sabretooth&#x27;s feud with Wolverine. The most common story involves both of them being participants of the Weapon X super-soldier program. After Wolverine escapes and attempts to suppress his animalistic qualities, Sabretooth becomes obsessed with forcing Wolverine to embrace his feral instincts by tormenting him and ruining his life.

In the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, Sabretooth is depicted as being Wolverine&#x27;s brother, portrayed by Tyler Mane in &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000) and &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024) and by Liev Schreiber in &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; (2009). In May 2008, &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine ranked Sabretooth #193 of the 200 best comic book characters of all time. In 2009, Sabretooth was ranked as &quot;IGN&quot;″s 44th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

==Publication history==

The character first appeared in &quot;Iron Fist&quot; #14 (August 1977) and was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Sabretooth was conceived as a recurring antagonist for Iron Fist, whom he fights several times, including once hidden behind a mask and gloves as &quot;the Slasher&quot;. He works for a time with the Constrictor as a partner-in-crime, and clashes repeatedly with Iron Fist and Power Man. Sabretooth also appeared in comics such as &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;. Chris Claremont introduced him as a minor X-Men villain, a member of the Marauders, during the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; crossover in 1986.

He rose to greater prominence when he was split off from the Marauders and became a recurring antagonist of an individual member of the X-Men, Wolverine. Sabretooth was subsequently featured in limited series and one-shot comics including &quot;Sabretooth and Mystique&quot; and &quot;Sabretooth: In the Red Zone&quot;, and even had his own ongoing reprint series in the mid-1990s, &quot;Sabretooth Classics&quot;.

===Origin===
Chris Claremont had meant for Sabretooth to be Wolverine&#x27;s father, though this was contradicted by subsequent writers. Claremont, when asked what he had intended to be the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, stated:

Father and son. That&#x27;s why Sabretooth always considered Logan &quot;sloppy seconds&quot; to his &quot;original&quot; / &quot;real deal.&quot; The other critical element in my presentation of their relationship was that, in their whole life, Logan has never defeated Sabretooth in a knock-down, drag-out, kill-or-be-killed berserker fight. By the same token, on every one of his birthdays, Sabretooth has always managed to find him, no matter where Logan was or what he was doing, and come within an inch of killing him. For no other reason than to remind him that he could.

Genetic tests performed by S.H.I.E.L.D. confirmed that Sabretooth and Wolverine were not father and son.

An interviewer asked Paul Jenkins if Dog Logan was Sabretooth. Jenkins had not intended the speculation, but said would not have a problem with another writer doing this later. The miniseries &quot;Astonishing Spider-Man &amp; Wolverine&quot; has shown that the two characters are not the same person. A one-shot specialty comic entitled &quot;X-Men Origins: Sabretooth&quot; chronicling some of the character&#x27;s earliest childhood experiences, differing distinctly from Dog&#x27;s life. It is also later shown that Sabretooth and Dog are separate people.

===&quot;X-Men Forever&quot;===
In &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;, Chris Claremont&#x27;s continuation of his run on &quot;X-Men&quot; (non-canonical to the mainstream timeline and taking place in the 161 Marvel Universe), Sabretooth is established as Wolverine&#x27;s father. He attacks the X-Mansion, but is blinded by Storm.

Claremont has stated in an interview that in &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;, the original true Sabretooth makes his reappearance after a long time, and that most of the previous appearances of Sabretooth prior to &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; #2, that follows directly after &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #3, were that of a weaker Sabretooth clone created by Mister Sinister. The original true Sabretooth reappears dressed in the Jim Lee costume in &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;, which would make the weaker clone the one dressed in the John Byrne costume. Claremont claims he always meant for the Sabretooth dressed in the Byrne costume to be later outed as a clone of the original true Sabretooth. Claremont stated: &quot;Speaking specifically of the cast of &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;, one character who&#x27;s becoming more enticing is Sabretooth, in part because (at least as it relates to my conception of him) very little is actually known. They then filled his skeleton with adamantium. At this specific point of his life, readers haven&#x27;t really seen that much of him over the years, since the Sabes that&#x27;s shown up most over the time is a less-endowed copy cloned from spare cells by Mr. Sinister.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Sabretooth&#x27;s real name is believed to be Victor Creed. Sabretooth&#x27;s memories have been tampered with by clandestine organizations such as Weapon X and so much of what appears to be his past is not of credible account. The clearest accounts of Victor&#x27;s childhood begin with him murdering his brother Luther Creed over a piece of pie. His father Zebediah then chains him in the basement like an animal and systematically pulls out Victor&#x27;s elongated canines, which perennially grow back. Victor begs his mother Victoria to let him go, but she does not. Years pass until Victor eventually gnaws off his own hand to escape the basement and apparently murders his parents. It is later revealed that Sabretooth only killed his father, and took care of his mother financially, visiting her frequently until her death.

Victor is revealed to have had a brother named Saul and a sister named Clara who are believed to be the reason for Victor&#x27;s ongoing feud with the X-Men&#x27;s Wolverine. Saul Creed was a tracker and hunter, while Clara Creed was an animal handler. They helped track down the feral James &quot;Logan&quot; Howlett for a circus. They also helped Logan escape after the man was experimented on by Nathaniel Essex, and the three go on the run. Saul perceives Logan to be stealing Clara, leading to Saul tipping Essex off regarding Logan&#x27;s location. In the ensuing chaos, Logan accidentally kills Clara, although her healing factor later revives Clara. Saul, not knowing this, blames Essex for Clara&#x27;s death, and the two men seek Essex out, Saul revealing that Clara was his sister. Logan finds out that Saul betrayed them to Essex, and drowns Saul in a potion of Essex&#x27;s. Horrified by this, Clara asks Wolverine to never look for her again. Victor was then informed about his brother&#x27;s death. After this, Sabretooth captured Logan and brought him back to be experimented on by Essex at the Ravencroft Institute. However, Essex&#x27;s assistant Dr. Claudia Russell (ancestor to Jack Russell), freed Logan. Creed and Essex later killed Russell for this and experimented on her corpse.

In an early tale, Logan lives in a small Blackfoot community. One day, Sabretooth tracks him down in Canada, and seemingly murders his one-time teammate&#x27;s lover Silver Fox on Logan&#x27;s birthday, after Silver Fox rejects him. In this tale, it is indicated that Logan did not have particularly strong feelings for Silver Fox, and that the murder was simply the last straw in a series of grievances he held against Sabretooth. Creed eventually adopts a tradition of tracking Logan down on his foe&#x27;s birthday with the intention of fighting.

===Early history===
Creed is recruited into a top secret CIA covert ops unit known as Team X, with allies John Wraith (Kestrel), Logan (Wolverine), Silver Fox (whose death was a hoax), and David North (Maverick). On one mission, the psychopathic Sabretooth kills a crucial scientist during a battle against Russian supersoldier Omega Red, causing Team X to break up. During this period, he fathers a son, Graydon Creed, with the mutant shapeshifter Mystique, who is undercover in the guise of a spy named Leni Zauber. Graydon grows up to found Friends of Humanity, an anti-mutant organization, and while running for president is assassinated by Mystique from an alternate future.

After the disbanding of Team X, Logan and Victor meet up again, as friends, when Logan learns of anti-mutant forces within the government. Victor and Logan form a team of rebel mutants, and Victor falls in love with a mutant named Holo. Eventually, Creed grows tired of the fighting and wants to leave with Holo, but she has already decided against it. In the final conflict, Holo is mortally wounded. Creed blames Logan for her death.

Next, Sabretooth is recruited by the Weapon X program, but it is unknown what, if any, enhancements he receives. As part of the program, his memories are tampered with by the psychic mutant Aldo Ferro, also known as Psi-Borg.

In 1968, Creed (using the alias Sabretooth) works as a mercenary assassin in Saigon. An individual called the &quot;White Devil&quot;, involved in the disappearance of soldiers and locals, contacts Sabretooth and offers to employ him as one of his own enforcers. Sabretooth accepts.

===Supervillain===

Emerging as a costumed villain, Sabretooth becomes partners with the Constrictor and the two act as enforcers for major criminal interests. Sabretooth battles Iron Fist and is badly beaten. Sabretooth and the Constrictor then fight Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Misty Knight, and Colleen Wing only to be defeated again. With the Constrictor, Creed begins to stalk and kill human beings for pleasure, which earns him the newspaper title of &quot;The Slasher&quot;; he also attacks Misty Knight again. With the Constrictor, he attacks Harmony Young, but they are defeated by Luke Cage. The Constrictor and Sabretooth dissolve their partnership, and Sabretooth nearly kills the Constrictor at one time.
Sabretooth is next reunited with his employer, the Foreigner, who claims to have trained the mercenary at some point. He attacks the Black Cat, nearly biting through her leg until he encounters a crowbar hidden underneath her boot. He is defeated by Spider-Man, and outmaneuvered and humiliated by the Black Cat in combat.

Sabretooth eventually encounters a thief by the name of Gambit and the two fight, but find they are not exactly enemies. Later while recruiting for Mister Sinister, Gambit gathers a group of mutant criminals he has associated with who form the Marauders. Sinister clones several of the Marauders so that he has a loyal group of lackeys after the originals die.

The Marauders are directed to massacre the Morlocks, which sets Sabretooth in another battle against Wolverine. Sabretooth and the Marauders join in an attack on Polaris, and battle Wolverine again during the Marauders&#x27; attempt to kill Madelyne Pryor. Wolverine stabs Sabretooth through the heart and uses Scrambler&#x27;s power to disable his healing factor, killing him. He is replaced by a clone by the time the X-Men attack the Marauders&#x27; headquarters. With the X-Men slaughtering his teammates, Sabretooth flees and is reunited with Mr. Sinister at the X-Mansion. The X-Men and X-Factor attack them there, and apparently kill both Sabretooth and Sinister. However, Sabretooth manages to keep his tradition of stalking Wolverine on his birthday that year.

Sabretooth returns to the sewers to slaughter leftover Morlocks. He kills Chickenwings, hunts Mole, and then battles Archangel. Caliban, a surviving Morlock, hunts Sabretooth down. Sabretooth proves no match for Caliban, who breaks his back and leaves him for dead. It takes weeks for his healing factor to repair his spine, during which he sustains himself on sewer water and passing vermin. He recovers just in time to confront Wolverine, who stumbled upon him while lost in the sewers. He attacks Wolverine again in Times Square, but their conflict is cut short by a vigilante who shoots them both with hallucinogen-laced bullets which trigger memories of their time as partners in the CIA.

Sabretooth then allies with Fenris and Matsu&#x27;o Tsurayaba against the X-Men and Maverick. While attending a wrestling match, Sabretooth is attacked by the Weapon X robot Shiva. He is rescued by John Wraith, who convinces him to team up with the rest of Team X - Wolverine, Maverick, Silver Fox, and John Wraith - to discover why their anti-aging factors are suddenly failing. Their quest leads them to the telepath Aldo Ferro, the Psi-Borg. Ferro overwhelms them all with psychic illusions, concluding with a toothed tree which apparently consumes Creed.

Suffering from severe bloodlust, Sabretooth hires telepathic mutant Birdy to help him keep his urges in check by providing what he calls &quot;the glow&quot;, a psychic blast that satiates his bloodlust and numbs the pain of his suppressed memories as a youth, allowing himself control for short periods.

===Betrayal of the X-Men and brief alliance with X-Factor===

A short time later, Birdy is killed by Sabretooth&#x27;s grown son Graydon, who now has a hatred for mutants, especially his father. Without &quot;the glow&quot;, Sabretooth slips into a murderous killing spree. This culminates in a clash with Maverick, whom Sabretooth defeats. He escapes, claiming only Wolverine can do what needs to be done to the psychotic Creed. Afterward, Maverick approaches the X-Men in Japan, and an ancient telepath, comatose since the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, who mind-links with Creed and the team discovers Creed&#x27;s psychosis was rooted in his time as a CIA operative. On a mission, he slaughtered a target, his wife (a &quot;frail&quot; for Creed), and a little boy. The look in the boy&#x27;s eyes has followed Creed ever since. Ultimately, Sabretooth attacks Charles Xavier, leader of the X-Men. As Xavier infiltrates Creed&#x27;s mind, he discovers that every victim Sabretooth has killed is remembered by the villain. Xavier is confident this means Creed values human life, and there is hope for the mutant. Sabretooth is incarcerated, as a wanted murderer, in a holographic environment because Xavier does not want him to roam on the grounds. Sabretooth is angered, but grudgingly stays with the team. During his incarceration, he assists in battles against the X-Cutioner and the Phalanx. Caliban, free of Apocalypse&#x27;s control, kidnaps the X-Man Jubilee in exchange for Sabretooth. When Sabretooth arrives, he mauls Caliban&#x27;s face, and Caliban flees. Wolverine, who had left the team after his adamantium was removed by Magneto, returns, and the villain escapes for a fight. This leads to Wolverine stabbing one of his claws into Sabretooth&#x27;s brain.

The newer, gentler Sabretooth is frequently nursed by X-Force member Boomer; he eventually reveals that he was feigning helplessness, and attacks Boomer. Psylocke saves the young mutant&#x27;s life, and she uses her psionic knife to disable him. However, this no longer works because his brain injury from Wolverine freed him from the need for &quot;the glow&quot;, furthermore rendering him resistant to telepathic detection and control. Retaliating, Sabretooth nearly kills Psylocke, but he is finally confronted by the X-Men, who incapacitate him.

He is turned over to the custody of Dr. Valerie Cooper, who fits him with an explosive restraining collar and forces him to participate as a member of the government-sponsored X-Factor team. Creed later admits he was a &quot;sleeper&quot; agent with the mission of executing X-Factor members the government could not control. He eventually escapes, and returns once more to mercenary work. Under unknown circumstances he gains adamantium skeleton and claws. Sabretooth is captured, along with Wolverine, by Apocalypse, who forces the two to fight each other for the right to become Apocalypse&#x27;s new Horseman, Death. After Sabretooth&#x27;s defeat, Apocalypse extracts the adamantium from him and bonds it to Wolverine, Wolverine having fought to win as he felt that he might resist the brainwashing and so be easier to defeat than Sabretooth, who might actually enjoy what he had become.

Sabretooth then joins Mystique&#x27;s new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, calling itself the Brotherhood, where he participates in an assassination attempt against Senator Robert Kelly.

===Weapon X and the Brotherhood===

Later, he is forced to become a member of a relaunched Weapon X program, where his skeleton is infused with adamantium once more. In &quot;Wolverine&quot; (vol. 2) #166, Sabretooth reveals that by means of genetic enhancement the Weapon X program has increased his strength and accelerated his healing factor. Eventually he escaped the program again and resumed working solo. However, he sometimes worked on a team, such as when he worked with several other villains to locate the Identity Disc, a record of heroes&#x27; secret identities. This ended up being a ruse, though Nick Fury had the real disc.

Later, in Canada, he encountered Sasquatch and the newest Wendigo. Sasquatch believes Creed may be responsible for some of the human deaths occurring there. Creed is seen setting traps and acting mysteriously. Sasquatch discovers Sabretooth is playing a twisted mind-game with the Wendigo before attempting to kill it. Sabretooth and the Wendigo fall into the Arctic Sea with Sabretooth biting the Wendigo&#x27;s neck, and both are presumed dead by Sasquatch. After a fearsome battle in the arctic waters, Sabretooth emerged victorious with the hide of the Wendigo.

Sabretooth would later attack the Xavier Institute, in a revamped Brotherhood consisting of leader Black Tom Cassidy, Mammomax, Avalanche, Exodus, and undercover heroes Nocturne and Juggernaut. Wolverine claims to have killed Sabretooth, spreading him &quot;all over the grass&quot;, although Black Tom&#x27;s plant abilities probably contributed to Sabretooth&#x27;s survival; he returns in &quot;X-Men: The 198 Files&quot;.

===Reluctant alliance with the X-Men===
In &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #188 (August 2006), Sabretooth was spotted fleeing a mysterious group of superhumans collectively known as The Children. Their reasons for pursuing him remained unknown, but two of them—Sangre and Serafina—were tracking him. Sangre activated a singularity generator that annihilated most of the town and killed all its citizens, except for a little girl whom Serafina deliberately shielded from the destruction so there would be a witness to what had happened. He later encountered two more of the Children—Aguja and Fuego. They attacked him and temporarily neutralized his healing factor, but he managed to escape regardless, only to end up at the Xavier Institute later that night seeking sanctuary.

It is revealed that the Children are after Creed because he has seen them and knows who they are, while the public believed the X-Men destroyed the town. It is only when Rogue, the leader of the team, injected Nano-Sentinels into Sabretooth&#x27;s blood that they take him along with their fight against the Children, a factor that one of the Children exploited. At one point, Cannonball saved his life during the battle. Sabretooth rewards him with some inside information: &quot;The first time you turn your back, you&#x27;re dead.&quot; Following the incident on Providence, Creed escaped the X-Men, but was hurled into the middle of the Pacific Ocean by Cable.

Writer Mike Carey noted he has no plans on redeeming Sabretooth, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to try and show a heroic side to Sabretooth&#x27;s nature; I&#x27;m not going to retcon him so that there are reasons for his actions that make him forgivable. The things he&#x27;s done are not forgivable and he can&#x27;t be redeemed. I&#x27;m not making him into a hero; I&#x27;m making him into a team member and there are reasons within the first storyline as to why he ends up fighting alongside the X-Men against another enemy. And there are reasons why it&#x27;s not so easy to simply shake him off again afterwards. There are things that are going on that will sort of unfold during the first year of my run which explain his being there and explain his being accepted with very, very grave misgivings into the team.&quot;

===Death===

Sabretooth renews his rivalry with Wolverine following the latter&#x27;s return to the X-Mansion. A fight soon breaks out with Wolverine tossing Sabretooth through a window. During the fight, Wolverine thinks back to the time when Sabretooth had, supposedly, killed Silver Fox. He remembers Sabretooth saying, &quot;quod sum eris&quot; and asks what it means. Sabretooth explains that it means &quot;I am what you will be.&quot; Wolverine loses control and calls Sabretooth insane before placing his fist against Sabretooth&#x27;s throat. Creed tells him if he extracts his claws, he will rip his heart out. Wolverine replies, &quot;Let &#x27;er rip&quot;, and pops his claws into Sabretooth&#x27;s throat. Wolverine later regains consciousness and finds himself chained to the roof of the Blackbird. He quickly breaks free of the chains and is surprised to find Sabretooth piloting the jet. Wolverine breaks into the cockpit and begins choking Sabretooth with one of the chains and causes him to crash.

The two emerge from the flaming wreckage and, while healing from the injuries sustained in the crash, begin fighting once again until separated by a lightning bolt, courtesy of Wolverine&#x27;s former teammate and current Queen of Wakanda, Storm. A short time later Sabretooth is chained up in the royal palace of Wakanda and complains to Wolverine, Storm, and the Black Panther. Sabretooth snaps the chains and escapes into the jungle, with the Black Panther quickly giving chase. The Black Panther catches up to him and the two begin to fight, with Sabretooth quickly gaining the upper hand. He holds the Black Panther off the ground by the neck, preparing to strike a killing blow, when Wolverine suddenly appears and slices off Sabretooth&#x27;s left hand.

Once the fight between the Black Panther and Sabretooth is broken up by Wolverine, Sabretooth is brought back to the Wakandan Palace and placed in a vibranium holding cell and guarded around the clock. The battle scene between the Black Panther and Sabretooth then becomes the focus of why Wolverine was brought to the palace in the first place. It seems that amongst the bones from an elephant graveyard, there are also some unidentified skeletal remains of another offshoot of Homo sapiens called &quot;Lupus sapiens&quot;. The Black Panther and Wolverine are discussing that instead of there being one evolutionary path between humans and monkeys, that there may also have been one that developed from lupines. It is believed at this point that Romulus is the first of this race, and it is revealed that he has been the one behind Daken&#x27;s attacks, and the driving force behind the Weapon X program. After the discussion with the Black Panther, Wolverine is awakened by the stench of blood from something that has a scent similar to his and Sabretooth&#x27;s and also something else. It turns out to be an enhanced Wild Child who has now surpassed the abilities of both Wolverine and Sabretooth, thanks to Romulus. Wild Child strikes Wolverine with poison-tipped claws and incapacitates him for two days. When Wolverine awakens, he finds Sasquatch, Wolfsbane, and Feral and her sister Thornn ready to go back with him to the Weapon X complex so that they might get to the bottom of this lupine mystery.

Once they all arrive at the Weapon X facility, Wolverine is plagued by memories that seem to mix past and present together and all of them controlled by Romulus. Wolverine goes in alone telling the others to stay put on the plane, but they do not listen. Feral and Thornn, who were granted their lupine appearance back by Romulus, are separated and Sabretooth, reduced to his animalistic state, has gutted Feral and she is dying. Wolverine gets Feral back to the ship and finds that Thornn and Wolfsbane are in shock from the encounter, along with Sasquatch having been incapacitated by Wild Child. Once they are on their way, Wolverine goes back to the Xavier Institute and asks Cyclops to give him back the Muramasa sword, which he gave to Scott in case he was too out of control and needed to be put down for good. Cyclops only does this after Emma Frost reads Wolverine&#x27;s mind and sees the horrors that Wolverine has been witnessing when he dreams: the horrors committed by Victor Creed throughout the years. Sword in hand, Wolverine then sets out to find and kill Sabretooth once and for all.

After the events in &quot;Evolution&quot;, Wolverine has been waiting for an unspecified length of time at Silver Fox&#x27;s cabin in the Canadian wilderness. Sabretooth finally shows up and immediately attacks him. In the ensuing battle Wolverine cuts off Sabretooth&#x27;s left arm with the Muramasa. Sabretooth, still in his animalistic state tries to re-attach his arm allowing his healing factor to kick in, but it does not work. Wolverine explains to a bewildered Creed that it is because the sword interrupts the healing factor and that he has to finally kill Sabretooth for what he has done. Managing to regain control and speak between grunts, Sabretooth tells him, &quot;Do it&quot;. Wolverine then decapitates Sabretooth, finally putting an end to his long-time enemy. Logan then walks away, leaving both Creed&#x27;s body and head in the snow to rot.

===Hell===
Sabretooth appears to Wolverine, leashed and under the control of the Devil himself, who has claimed to have broken Victor&#x27;s will. Victor shows defiance by striking the face of his defeated master after Wolverine uses his broken bone claws to pin the Devil to a wall. After Wolverine has an interrupted discussion with his father, it is shown that Victor wields the Devil&#x27;s sword, which is being held as a symbol of who is the ruler of Hell. Wolverine fights Victor again, mentioning, as he beheads him once more, that there is no coming back when someone is killed by the sword. Wolverine leaves Victor&#x27;s beheaded soul lying in the pit of Hell.

===Return===

It was later revealed that the Sabretooth beheaded by Logan was in fact one of several clones grown by Romulus. The real Sabretooth comes out of hiding and starts a war between rival gangs in Japan. He is hired to kill Mr. Takenaka, leader of the Yakuza, and tosses him from a jet. Creed is later approached by other Yakuza members to accept an offer at an airport in L.A. Sabretooth says he will miss an important meeting by going, and kills the Yakuza. Creed sets a trap for Logan before heading to his meeting, but it fails causing the two to battle. Their battling ends with them surrounded by Yakuza, the Hand, the new Silver Samurai and Wolverine&#x27;s adopted daughter. Logan goes to save his daughter, while Victor grabs the Silver Samurai. It is later revealed Creed is working with Mystique again as well as the Mind Ninjas. Mystique disables Wolverine while Sabretooth heads on to the next part of his plan. He escapes with the man who hired him, Azuma Goda, to cause a war between the Hand and the Yakuza. As Goda reveals his master plan of becoming a ruler of Japan by proxies, Sabretooth has his own plans. He allows Wolverine to slip in and try to kill Goda while he saves Mystique from Lord Deathstrike and makes him an offer. The three of them arrive at a meeting of the remaining leaders of the fighting factions, who are deciding the fate of Tokyo and kill them all as Sabretooth declares himself the new &quot;invisible&quot; ruler of East Asia. Sabretooth later holds a party with but Wolverine crashes the party and defeats all the guests, he then tells Sabretooth &quot;Happy birthday, from your old pal Wolverine&quot;.

Sabretooth trains Kade Kilgore in combat and tactics, with the purpose of attacking the Jean Grey School. Sabretooth tells Kilgore the best way to destroy them is to hit them in the heart, physical or metaphorical. Kilgore figures that the heart of the school is Beast (Henry McCoy). Sabretooth ambushes the latter managing to physically wound him before taking his fight to Abigail Brand, Hank&#x27;s girlfriend. With help from Beast, Abigail is able to blast Sabretooth away.

Later while investigating the grave of Sabretooth, Wolverine finds that the body still is in it, which indicates that Sabretooth was not resurrected. Wolverine also discovers that it was apparently Romulus behind everything and after being beaten, he is saved by a mysterious woman with long red hair who tells him to go to the Weapon X facility, but she disappears before he gets further answers. Wolverine goes to explore the facility only to find that someone has been experimenting with Sabretooth&#x27;s genetics and has cloned him, one awakens, who Wolverine recognizes by scent to be the real Sabretooth. After fighting the Sabretooth clones, Wolverine encounters the mysterious woman again, claiming that she is Romulus&#x27; twin sister Remus. She reveals that the whole &quot;Lupine Sapiens&quot; story was an elaborate hoax by her brother intended to be a ruse for his real goal of creating a master race of natural mutants artificially enhanced by a new type of adamantium, using Wolverine as a template. After tracking Romulus, Wolverine brutally attacks and incapacitates Sabretooth. While Wolverine fights Romulus, Sabretooth fights with Cloak who has been investigating with Wolverine. While Romulus is ultimately defeated by Wolverine and left in the Raft facility, Sabretooth manages to escape from the battle.

Sabretooth appears as a member of Daken&#x27;s short-lived Brotherhood of Mutants. Then later becomes a headmaster of the Hellfire Academy. While he also works with Mystique to frame the original X-Men for a series of bank thefts.

Sabretooth was among the villains contracted by the Assassins Guild to target Elektra&#x27;s allies.

===Inversion===
During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Sabretooth appears as a member of Magneto&#x27;s unnamed supervillain group during the fight against Red Skull&#x27;s Red Onslaught form. Sabretooth experiences a &#x27;moral inversion&#x27; that turns him into a hero when the attempt to bring out the Xavier elements of Onslaught backfire, prompting Steve Rogers to recruit him and the other inverted villains into a new team of &#x27;Astonishing Avengers&#x27; to defeat the inverted heroes. At the end of the storyline, it is shown that his inversion from evil to good is permanent due to him having been protected by an energy shield generated by the inverted Iron Man- along with Havok- leaving him reflecting on what he has become. Sabretooth turned himself over to the authorities and plans to do good by Wolverine&#x27;s example when he gets out.

Sabretooth later joins the Avengers Unity Division and accompanies them to the High Evolutionary&#x27;s Counter-Earth to look for Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. He also assists the main Avengers team in confronting the latest version of Ultron.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Sabretooth appears as a member of Magneto&#x27;s X-Men branch to protect mutantkind at all costs. As time goes on, his inversion starts to wear down. He notes that he can feel his former self coming back - the part of him that cared about nothing but the kill. He admits not being able to keep living the lie his inverted-self has been, but he does not intend to become the monster he was, so he must become something different. He believes he needs something to fight for to stay grounded, and he remembers the promise he made to Monet, whom he developed feelings for. He promised to keep her curse secret and wanted to help find a cure and beat the darkness within her. When the team disbanded, Sabretooth went off with Monet to continue trying to help her.

===ResurrXion===
After leaving Monet due to her becoming too evil, Creed went to live in a cabin in the woods during the &quot;Weapons of Mutant Destruction&quot; storyline. He is &quot;recruited&quot; by Old Man Logan to battle against a new Weapon X Project. They alongside the captives of the Weapon X Project discover that they are created Hulk/Wolverine hybrids which led to the creation of Weapon H.

During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Sabretooth is seen at Chester&#x27;s Bar where he, Daken, and Lady Deathstrike discuss Wolverine being sighted after returning from the dead. Sabretooth tells Daken that he will kill Wolverine and then kill Daken. The three of them follow his trail to Maybelle, Arizona. Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike continue searching Maybelle for Wolverine when they are attacked by zombies made from those at a birthday party. One of them bites Sabretooth as Lady Deathstrike gets him away from the zombies. Both of them wonder where the zombies came from. As they get to their car, it suddenly explodes. Sabretooth starts running and finds that his zombie bite is not healing. Sabretooth comes across more zombies as he starts killing them with Lady Deathstrike not far behind him. Both of them take refuge in a garage. When Daken catches up to them, Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth are informed of a glowing green device in the power station that has to do with the zombies and they must fight their way past the zombies to destroy it before Maybelle is burned to the ground. While fighting the zombies and soldiers from Soteira Killteam Nine, Sabretooth discovers that one of the soldiers is a zombified version of his dead son Graydon. After getting Daken away from the attackers after he was stabbed by the zombified version of Lord Dark Wind, Sabreooth defends Daken from his zombified son as there is 10 minutes left before Maybelle is burned to the ground. Sabretooth continues his fight with his zombie son trying to get the information on how he was raised as a zombie until Lady Deathstrike stabs Graydon in the neck and states that the adamantium that they tracked was her father&#x27;s adamantium. With six minutes left before Soteira burns Maybelle to the ground, Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike destroy the glowing device. The next day, Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike carjack someone outside a diner as Sabretooth suggests to Lady Deathstrike to have her Reaver friends get her a new hand. Lady Deathstrike tells Sabretooth to shut up and drive. Sabretooth later relayed his discovery to Kitty Pryde as she mentions to Iron Man and Daredevil that he is trying to get some redemption.

===House of X===
In &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad infiltrate the base of Damage Control searching for information in the databases. While they get what they searched for, Sabretooth maims several guards in the chaos and is eventually captured by the Fantastic Four. While the Fantastic Four are about to take away Sabretooth, Cyclops arrives to bring him back to Krakoa due to diplomatic immunity. While tensions arise between him and Mister Fantastic, Cyclops decides to leave Sabretooth to them to avoid a situation. In the superhuman prison known as Project Achilles, a trial is being held for Sabretooth. The trial is interrupted by Emma Frost who presents the judge with a pardon from the U.S. Supreme Court as the U.S. government has agreed to a general amnesty for all mutants on American soil in anticipation of Krakoa becoming a sovereign nation. Despite the protests of the human officials at the court, Emma and Sabretooth are allowed to walk free and return to Krakoa. The Quiet Council finds Sabretooth guilty of violating the second law and sentences him to exile deep within the bowels of Krakoa. Krakoa swallows him up as X laments the business of running a nation.

While in The Pit, Sabretooth was contacted mentally by Cypher on behalf of Krakoa itself, who gave him control of his own mental fantasy world. Sabretooth lived out several fantasy lives to entertain himself, at one point he even imagined himself walking freely through Krakoa. Although he remained in the pit, he was seen on Krakoa. While fantasizing about being king of Hell, he was interrupted by the arrival of the other exiled mutants Nekra, Madison Jeffries, Oya, Melter, and Third-Eye. He welcomed them to his Hell and informed them there is no escape. Sabretooth tried to attack the incomers at first, but after Third-Eye broke the illusion down, he was able to convince him the people he really wanted to hurt were their captors. Victor then began working on a plan for them all to escape The Pit, he taught them how to project their consciousness through the island and had them manifest themselves to gather allies from above. He decided to keep Melter back because he could sense he still had loyalty to Professor X. After brutalizing Melter, Sabretooth explained his plan to exposing the secret and inhumane imprisonments on Krakoa to bring public opinion against the Quiet Council, while he was talking Melter was able to gain enough control of his body to destroy Sabretooth&#x27;s body in the material plane. The destruction of Sabretooth&#x27;s body almost kills everyone in the pit because it was controlled by his mind, but Third-Eye saves the other prisoners by dragging their consciousnesses to the astral plane. Sabretooth&#x27;s mind retreats into his memories while his healing factor fixes his body, he briefly manifests himself on land again to check the progress of his plan and finds rescue attempts are already being discussed. Back in his mental world he recreates his childhood home so he can have dinner with the other prisoners, after doing so they all discuss what they did to get thrown in the pit and whether they deserved to be there. Cypher than reached out to Victor again, angry that he had been misusing their gift but Victor pointed out to them his plan was close to succeeding and convinced him they had no choice but to set him free. Sabretooth escaped from The Pit shortly after a failed attempt by Magma to free them resulted in everyone in the area being knocked unconscious. With no-one to see him and or offer resistance he ran towards Nekra&#x27;s abandoned boat but was stopped unexpectedly by Mystique. Destiny had foreseen his escape attempt but to their shock told Mystique to allow him to sail off to freedom, asking him to &quot;cause chaos&quot;, which he happily accepted. Cypher then sent the other exiles he had abandoned on a mission to find Sabretooth so he can face punishment for his escape.

Sabretooth&#x27;s boat was caught and apprehended by Orchis agents, who took him to Dr. Barrington to be experimented on. After being vivisected by her, she left to deal with the rest of the exiles who had infiltrated her private island. While she was gone Sabretooth smashed through his glass container and went on a rampage throughout her base, killing everyone he could find before they activated the self destruct protocol. Sabretooth tracked down his boat and escaped to the Island where he cockily offered the rest of the Exiles a ride.

After being reunited with his team, Sabretooth was given a savage beatdown by Nekra. Causing him to realize his healing factor, along with the rest of his powers, were not working properly. This was due to a device Dr. Barrington had put inside his body during her experimentation called the Barrington coil. After convincing the team they still need him if they wanted to save Orphan-Maker and hearing from Nanny how dangerous he would be if separated from his armor, Sabretooth and the exiled Mutants tracked down the second Orchis base for Mutant experimentation in a volcano ridden area of the Pacific Ocean called the Ring of Fire. Sabretooth was still deeply in pain due to the loss of his Healing Factor but was forced to pretend everything was fine because he wanted to hide this from the others. They discovered a huge prison filled with Mutants, all of whom expressed fear when Sabretooth arrived, something he took great pride in. When Dr. Barrington&#x27;s creation came in through a wall, Nekra tried to resume their fight but Sabretooth stopped her because he could tell she was running away from something. That something was Orphan-Maker, who had taken off his helmet, apparently killing Dr. Barrington with one look. Sabretooth suggested they throw Orphan-Maker in a volcano before they were all killed by his emerging power, the team disagreed and Third-Eye offered a more humane solution that involved taking them all back to the Astral Plane. While there, the team discovered that Orchis had somehow built their third base inside the Astral Plane. While Nanny and Jeffries built a new armor for Orphan-Maker, Creed explored the base with Toad and Oya, getting into a fight with Toad over whether the failure of the mission that got him put in the pit was his own fault, until Oya interrupted them because she had noticed someone in an organic prison. Assuming the figure to be dangerous, Victor and Toad abandoned her, and rejoined the rest of the group. However Oya met with them later and revealed that the prisoner was in fact another Victor Creed.

The team escapes with the freed Orchis prisoners on their boat which Madison used debris from the destroyed base to turn into a vessel big enough to contain them all. Sabretooth watches his other self die, unsure of how he got there but believing he was about to suffer the same fate due to Dr. Barrington&#x27;s experimentations. He concluded Dr. Barrington could not have done this to him alone and there is only one person who could have been responsible. Struggling to maintain the illusion of strength, he decides to enact one last plan for revenge against the Quiet Council by turning all the young mutant prisoners against Krakoa, he is interrupted when the team arrive at the final, underwater Orchis base and are hit by a tidal wave. During the commotion he is again abducted by Orchis, telling his team to come looking for him before disappearing. When he arrives at the final Orchis base his suspicions for who is responsible for his suffering are confirmed when he is confronted by his son Graydon Creed with a wall full of mounted Sabretooth heads. Graydon revealed to him that he had been hunting versions of his father throughout the Multiverse to practice for this fight. Creed ended up in a fight with his son and three other versions of himself, during which Greydon ran off to get backup. Too weak to move, Sabretooth convinces the others to remove the Barrington coil from his body so he can help them defeat Graydon and get them back to their own Universes. Once fully healed, Sabretooth joins the others in a fight with Graydon and an army of headless cyborgs he made from the Sabretooth clones that he killed. Figuring out he is controlling them from his suit, he throws his son through a portal to another dimension, then he and all his duplicates take over the final Orchis base and pilot it towards Krakoa in order to surprise Wolverine for his birthday.

===Sabretooth War===
After traveling the Multiverse, killing multiversal variants of the X-Men and recruiting &quot;Camo&quot; - a version of Sabretooth from Earth-33441 who can transform himself into others - from his own universe at the start of the &quot;Sabretooth War&quot; storyline, Sabretooth and his other variants - patriotic superhero &quot;Cap&quot; from Earth-203, and Savage Land inhabitant &quot;Savage&quot; from Earth-1912, and bad boy celebrity &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; of Earth-12 - along with their army of headless Sabretooth cyborgs, arrive on Krakoa to his enact revenge on the Quiet Council for Wolverine&#x27;s birthday only to find the mutant nation empty as Sabretooth was unaware of the events that transpired during the &quot;Fall of X&quot; storyline. Their presence is picked up by Black Tom Cassidy from X-Force&#x27;s Arctic base and Kid Omega is sent to investigate. Camo disguises himself as Wolverine to trick Kid Omega. With his guard lowered, Camo stabs Kid Omega in the neck while Sabretooth and the others cannibalize his body. Using the telepathic energy from Kid Omega&#x27;s still alive head, the Sabretooth Army tracks down Wolverine at the arctic base and uses the head&#x27;s telepathic powers to put Black Tom and Sage in a trance. Sabretooth ambushes Daken - now calling himself Fang and had just began repairing his relationship with Wolverine - and kills him after a vicious duel. Sabretooth spells out &quot;HAPPy bIrThDAy&quot; with pieces of Fang&#x27;s corpse to taunt Wolverine. Wolverine flies into a berserk rage and attacks but is defeated by the headless Sabretooth cyborgs while Sabretooth continues to taunt him. Sabretooth restrains Wolverine with adamantium tentacles and wanting to prolong Wolverine&#x27;s suffering, proceeds to massacre many of the inhabitants at the arctic base with his army. Black Tom and Sage are freed from their trace and activate the base&#x27;s defense mechanisms, forcing Sabretooth to flee with Savage, Camo and the remnants of his army while Pretty Boy and most of the headless Sabretooth cyborgs are killed and Cap is left behind. Despite this, the remnant army manage to abduct Wolverine&#x27;s daughter Laura. Back at the station, Sabretooth uses Kid Omega&#x27;s head to read Wolverine&#x27;s thoughts. Satisfied that his actions have sent Wolverine into despair, he also discovers a hidden treasure map in Wolverine&#x27;s memories. Meanwhile, Savage and Camo blame Sabretooth for the deaths of their other counterparts and plot to recover Graydon against him while Kid Omega sends a telepathic message for help to the Exiles. X-Force capture and interrogate Cap for information regarding Sabretooth and his army and manage to uncover some of their history and plans using telepathy until a psionic image of Sabretooth - implanted within Cap&#x27;s mind as a &quot;failsafe&quot; - attacks Phoebe Cuckoo, forcing Domino to kill Cap to save her. Kid Omega sends another telepathic distress signal from Sabretooth&#x27;s base to X-Force, to which Wolverine flies to alone on X-Force&#x27;s &quot;Bluebird&quot; to confront him. Following the map&#x27;s coordinates, Sabretooth flies back to Krakoa and discovers with Omega&#x27;s head that the treasure is buried beneath the island. Meanwhile, the Exiles are driven away by the patrolling Stark Sentinels while Wolverine is able to get past them. Sabretooth and Wolverine pick up on each other&#x27;s scents and Sabretooth immobilizes Wolverine with a telepathic blast from Omega by having him relive memories of their Team X days. Believing that they are doing a mission together, Wolverine leads Sabretooth further into Krakoa&#x27;s depths into Forge&#x27;s workshop. The Exiles catch up to Sabretooth, who forces Wolverine to help him fight them off. Sabretooth kills Toad while Wolverine kills Melter, whose death snaps Wolverine out of his hypnosis. While Wolverine is briefly stunned by his actions, Sabretooth reveals the &quot;treasure&quot; he needed Wolverine to help him acquire: Forge&#x27;s Neutralizer, which he promptly shoots and depowers Wolverine with. Despite losing his healing factor, Wolverine puts up a fight against Sabretooth, who resorts to using Omega to generate a psionic gun which he uses to shoot Wolverine in the head with. While Sabretooth contemplates what to do with the barely alive Wolverine, the surviving Exiles catch up to them. Out of revenge for the atrocities Sabretooth forced him to commit, Kid Omega shoots Sabretooth with a psychic blast while Nekra uses the Killing Seed- a mysterious seed previously given to her by Cypher to use against Sabretooth, which rapidly grows into a gigantic carnivorous plant that ensnares and devours Sabretooth. The Exiles take Wolverine&#x27;s unconscious body with them for medical attention while Kid Omega remains behind to watch Sabretooth&#x27;s suffering while waiting for X-Force to rescue him. While trapped within the Killing Seed, Sabretooth is placed under mental fantasy resembling a therapist&#x27;s office where a projection of Cypher acts as a therapist and forces Sabretooth to mentally experience the deaths of his many victims from their perspectives to help him feel a sense of remorse for his actions. Instead, Sabretooth rejects Cypher&#x27;s attempts to rehabilitate him and becomes emboldened by the memories of his victims, giving him the strength to break free from the Killing Seed. In Sabretooth&#x27;s absence, the Sabretooth Army has been decimated, with Laura killing Savage before sending a distress signal to X-Force while Graydon, who converted himself into a cyborg while trapped in an alternate dimension, betrays and kills Camo and the rest of the army. Before Graydon and Wolverine, donning Forge&#x27;s Adamantium Armor and wielding a Muramasa Blade to compensate for his lost powers, could face off, Sabretooth sneaks up behind Graydon and kills him. With the reunited X-Force and the Exiles converging together on Krakoa&#x27;s beach, Sabretooth lures Wolverine to the Pit and uses his mental connection to the Pit to drag Wolverine within his depths and uses its vines to strip him of his armor and sword. However, Phoebe severs Sabretooth&#x27;s connection to Krakoa, causing the Pit to eject Wolverine. Before X-Force or the Exiles could intervene, Wolverine reveals that the Adamantium Armor restored his powers and challenges Sabretooth to a final showdown. After a bloody and vicious battle, Wolverine kills and hacks Sabretooth to pieces with his claws and the Muramasa Blade, finally avenging his loved ones.

==Personality and themes==
Psychologist Suzana E. Flores notes that while all Marvel villains have antisocial traits, Sabretooth &quot;takes the notion of being antisocial to another level: he IS antisocial personality disorder incarnate.&quot; As such, he is manipulative, sadistic, and violent, and unable to attach emotionally to others. While the exact causes of his disorder are unclear, she concludes that this personality type probably cannot be effectively treated or rehabilitated.

==Powers and abilities==
Sabretooth is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology compared to normal humans. His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing ability that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his body and cellular structure far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. Like Wolverine&#x27;s, his abilities have been depicted with variable degrees of contradiction by various creators. Sabretooth&#x27;s increased attributes stem in part from said healing. This &quot;healing factor&quot; also grants him virtual immunity against most poisons, drugs, toxins, and diseases, and limited immunity to fatigue. The regenerative qualities of his powers cause him to age at an unusually slow rate. While he is of an unknown advanced age, Sabretooth has the appearance and vitality of a tall, very burly, highly muscular man in his late 20s to mid 30s.

The depiction of Sabretooth&#x27;s powers has changed and evolved depending on creative team, with his healing power introduced as a retcon after he became Wolverine&#x27;s rival. In other, earlier appearances, Sabretooth was much more average. In a fight with Spider-Man, he was incapacitated when his face was severely wounded, and did not display any accelerated healing. When Sabretooth returned, his still prominent wounds were reopened when he was hit in the face.

Sabretooth possesses acute senses that are comparable to certain animals. This includes the ability to see objects with greater clarity and at much greater distances than an ordinary human. He is able to see with this same level of clarity in almost complete darkness, just like a nocturnal hunter. It is also said that he can see infrared and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum.

He possesses some degree of notable physical abilities, such as superhuman strength due to his healing factor. The exact limits of his strength are unknown, though he originally could crush an iron barbell with ease. His physical strength has been artificially enhanced at least twice. The first was a strength enhancement from his son, Graydon. It was then further enhanced after joining the latest incarnation of the Weapon X Program. His healing factor also grants him superhuman stamina, so he can push himself at peak capacity for several days before fatigue sets in. On top of this he is depicted as having retractable claws that can rend normal clothing and flesh with ease.

His agility and reflexes were both naturally above human and further artificially-enhanced. With an ability to pounce like a hunting big cat, stalk and move quietly throughout his appearances, most human and some super powered enemies can not react to his leap before being hit.

===Skills===
Sabretooth is an excellent hand-to-hand and armed combatant, having been trained by various organizations such as the CIA, Department H&#x27;s Weapon X program, the Foreigner, and HYDRA. He is also an expert at hunting and tracking, even without the use of his heightened senses. Sabretooth also developed a high resistance to telepathic probing and manipulation, after an incident where his brain was skewered. And even with that damage to his brain, it has been shown that Sabretooth is actually quite intelligent compared to the average person, as shown by his ability to avoid capture and escape the highest levels of incarceration without assistance. He is also highly skilled at psychological manipulation, and has demonstrated the ability to speak fluent German.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Sabretooth 66th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, Comic Book Resources (CBR) ranked Sabretooth 21st in their &quot;Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel&#x27;s Coolest Alternate World&quot; list.

<doc id="310577" wikidata="Q3082980" url="?curid=310577" title="The Abolition of Work">
<text>&quot;The Abolition of Work&quot; is an essay written by Bob Black in 1985. It was part of Black&#x27;s first book, an anthology of essays entitled &quot;The Abolition of Work and Other Essays&quot; published by Loompanics Unlimited. It is an exposition of Black&#x27;s &quot;type 3 anarchism&quot; – a blend of post-Situationist theory and individualist anarchism – focusing on a critique of the work ethic.

== Influence ==

&quot;The Abolition of Work&quot; was a significant influence on futurist and design critic Bruce Sterling, who at the time was a leading cyberpunk science fiction author and called it &quot;one of the seminal underground documents of the 1980s&quot;. The essay&#x27;s critique of work formed the basis for the anti-labor faction in Sterling&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Islands in the Net&quot;.

<doc id="310582" wikidata="Q465182" url="?curid=310582" title="Peter I, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Peter I (; 1187 – 26 May 1250), also known as Peter Mauclerc and Peter of Dreux, reigned as Duke of Brittany alongside his wife Alix from 1213 to 1221, and was regent of the duchy for his minor son John I from 1221 to 1237. As duke he was also 1st Earl of Richmond from 1218 to 1235.

==Origins==
Peter was the second son of Robert II, Count of Dreux and Yolande de Coucy. The former was in turn the son of Robert I, Count of Dreux, a younger brother of Louis VII of France. Peter was thus a Capetian, a second cousin of Louis VIII of France.

Despite being of royal descent, as the younger son of a cadet branch Peter&#x27;s early prospects were that of a minor noble, with a few scattered fiefs in the Île-de-France and Champagne. He was initially destined for a career in the clergy, which he later renounced, earning him the nickname &quot;Mauclerc&quot; (French: &quot;mauvais clerc&quot;, bad-cleric). He broke the convention of ecclesiastical heraldry by placing on the canton of his paternal arms the ermine, then reserved for the clergy.

== Accession ==
In 1212 King Philip II of France needed to find a weak and faithful ruler for Brittany. The duchy lay athwart the sea lanes between England and the English territories in Gascony. Furthermore, it bordered on Anjou and Normandy, which the English had lost ten or twelve years before and were eager to recover. It was being ruled with less than a strong hand by Guy of Thouars, as regent for his young daughter Alix. Also worrisome was that Alix&#x27;s older half-sister Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany, was in an English prison.

King Philip thus broke off the betrothal of Alix and the Breton lord Henry of Penthièvre, and turned to his French cousin Peter, then in his early twenties. Peter married Alix, and on 27 January 1213, paid homage to the king for Brittany.

There is some ambiguity regarding whether Peter should be considered duke or count. The duchy was legally held by his wife. The king of France and the Pope (and their courts) always addressed him as count, but Peter in his own charters called himself duke.

== Relations with the English ==

In 1214 King John of England had assembled a formidable coalition against the French. He landed in Poitou while Otto IV of Germany prepared to invade from the north. John chased off some French forces in the north of Poitou, and then moved to the southern edge of Brittany, opposite Nantes. Peter drove him off after a brief skirmish but did nothing to hinder John&#x27;s subsequent movement up the Loire valley where he took a few Breton fortresses and then besieged La Roche-aux-Moines. John&#x27;s Poitevin vassals, however, refused to fight against a French force led by Prince Louis of France. Meanwhile, Otto&#x27;s army was crushed at Bouvines, and the entire invasion foundered.

It is not clear why John attempted to capture Nantes, even less why he would do so the hardest way, via the very well-defended bridge across the Loire. Nor is it clear why Peter declined to harass his forces from the rear as John marched east. A likely explanation is that the two had come to some sort of agreement whereby John would leave Brittany alone for the moment, and in return the Bretons would not hinder him elsewhere.

John had a prize he could dangle in front of Peter: the Earldom of Richmond. This great English honour had traditionally been held by the dukes of Brittany, and in fact a constant theme in Peter&#x27;s political affairs was the desire to hold and retain the English revenues from Richmond.

Peter did not yield to King John&#x27;s offers to accept the earldom and take up the king&#x27;s side in his conflicts with the English barons, probably because he deemed John&#x27;s prospects too uncertain. Moreover, Louis was again fighting against the English. But when Louis was defeated, Peter was sent as one of the negotiators for a peace treaty. After the negotiations were completed (in 1218), William Marshal, the regent for the young Henry III of England, recognized Peter as Earl of Richmond, in place of Eleanor of Brittany who remained under English imprisonment. The center of the earldom&#x27;s properties in Yorkshire was in the hands of the Earl of Chester, whom the regent could not afford to antagonize, but Peter did receive the properties of the earldom outside of Yorkshire, which in fact generated the bulk of the earldom&#x27;s income. In 1219 he participated in the capture of Marmande and the siege of Toulouse during the Albigensian Crusade.

== Consolidation of power ==

Peter turned his attention to his next goal. The authority of the dukes of Brittany had traditionally been weak, in comparison to the great peers of northern France. For example, the duke could not limit the building of castles by his counts. Nor did he have the right to guardianship of minor heirs of his vassals. Peter aimed to re-establish his relationship with his vassals (or subjects) more along the lines of what he knew from the Capetian royal court. To that end Peter simply declared new rules by fiat, and then faced the inevitable turmoil that resulted from the reaction of his barons. There followed a series of small civil wars and political maneuverings. In 1222 he suppressed a revolt by Breton barons in the Battle of Châteaubriant. By 1223, the barons had all acquiesced to the changes or been dispossessed.

The six Breton bishops were the other threat to the ducal power, for they had substantial landholdings (including control of all or part of the few cities in Brittany), and were recalcitrant in the face of Peter&#x27;s attempts to raise revenues by increasing taxes or simply taking possession of episcopal holdings. For this he was excommunicated for a time in 1219–1221. Peter submitted in the end, but this was not to be the last of his conflict with the bishops.

== Regency ==
Peter&#x27;s wife died on 21 October 1221, leaving behind four young children. She was then only 21, and little is known about her beyond the basic genealogical facts. Her death meant that Peter was no longer duke, although he continued to rule the duchy with undiminished authority, as regent for his son John, then a boy of four or so.

Alix&#x27;s death changed Peter&#x27;s goals in two ways. First, he aimed to acquire some additional territory, not part of the duchy, to augment his retirement after his son came of age. Second, there was a strong tradition in France that a minor heir should, when coming of age, have his property in the state it was in when he inherited it. Thus Peter could not now take some risks without fear of harming the prospects of his son.

Peter helped Philip II&#x27;s successor, Louis VIII, in his fight against Henry III of England (in the sieges of Niort and La Rochelle in 1224). He also accompanied Louis VIII on the Albigensian Crusade. According to Nicholas of Bray, he was present at the siege of Avignon in June–September. After Louis&#x27;s death in November, he participated, with Count Theobald IV of Champagne and Count Hugh X of La Marche, in rebellions against the regent Blanche of Castile, which lasted from 1227 until 1234.

In 1235 Peter renounced his allegiance to the king of England and suffered forfeiture of his English earldom, while Henry III began to give Eleanor better treatments, granting her the manor of Swaffham from the earldom. However, Pope Gregory IX announced that he only recognized descendants of Peter and Alix legitimate heirs to Brittany; whatever the intention of Henry, Eleanor was after all not restored of any titles nor released from confinement until her death in 1241.

== Crusades and death ==

Peter&#x27;s son John reached the age of majority in 1237. Peter Mauclerc then participated in the Barons&#x27; Crusade to the Holy Land in 1239. While there, Peter&#x27;s troops along with some local knights were attacked by heavily armed Mamluk cavalry, firing their bows, but the crusader force managed to outflank and defeat them, taking a few prisoners with them back to Jaffa.

In early November, two days into a march from Acre to Ascalon, Peter and his lieutenant Raoul de Soissons split off from the main force to conduct a raid. They divided their force in half and each waited in ambush along a possible route for the Muslim caravan which was moving up the Jordan to Damascus. Peter&#x27;s half clashed with the Muslims outside of a castle, and after some fighting, he sounded his horn to summon Raoul. The Muslims were routed and fled inside the castle, where Peter&#x27;s men followed them, killed many, took some captives, and seized the booty and edible animals of the caravan. This minor victory would soon be overshadowed by a serious defeat at Gaza.

Back in France, he won some success against the English at sea in 1242 and 1243. In 1249, he participated in the Seventh Crusade to Egypt under King Louis IX. He died at sea before he was able to return home. He was buried in Braine, France.

==Marriages and children==

Peter was married twice:

His first wife was Alix of Thouars, Duchess of Brittany (1201–1221). Alix and Peter had three children:
*John I (to 1217–1286), duke of Brittany;
*Yolande of Brittany (1218 – 10 October 1272), married (January 1236) to Hugh XI of Lusignan, Seigneur de Lusignan, Count of la Marche and Angoulême
*Arthur of Brittany (1220–1224)

His second wife was Marguerite de Montaigu, Lady of Montaigu, Commequiers, La Garnache then Machecoul, and widow of Hugh I de Thouars (died 1230), a brother to Guy of Thouars; this made Marguerite a paternal line aunt of Alix. They married by 1236, and had no issue.

Peter had an illegitimate son by a woman called Nicole:
*Oliver de Braine (1231–1279), who inherited the Lordship of Machecoul.

<text>Marshall David Sahlins ( ; December 27, 1930April 5, 2021) was an American cultural anthropologist best known for his ethnographic work in the Pacific and for his contributions to anthropological theory. He was the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and of Social Sciences at the University of Chicago.

==Biography==
Sahlins was born in Chicago, the son of Bertha (Skud) and Paul A. Sahlins. His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants. His father was a doctor while his mother was a homemaker. He grew up in a secular, non-practicing family. His family claims to be descended from Baal Shem Tov, a mystical rabbi considered to be the founder of Hasidic Judaism. Sahlins&#x27; mother admired Emma Goldman and was a political activist as a child in Russia.

Sahlins received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees at the University of Michigan where he studied with evolutionary anthropologist Leslie White. He earned his PhD at Columbia University in 1954. There his intellectual influences included Eric Wolf, Morton Fried, Sidney Mintz, and the economic historian Karl Polanyi. In 1957, he became assistant professor at the University of Michigan.

In the 1960s he became politically active, and while protesting against the Vietnam War, Sahlins coined the term for the imaginative form of protest now called the &quot;teach-in&quot;, which drew inspiration from the sit-in pioneered during the civil rights movement. In 1968, Sahlins signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. In the late 1960s, he also spent two years in Paris, where he was exposed to French intellectual life (and particularly the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss) and the student protests of May 1968. In 1973, he took a position in the anthropology department at the University of Chicago, where he was the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology Emeritus. His commitment to activism continued throughout his time at Chicago, most recently leading to his protest over the opening of the university&#x27;s Confucius Institute (which later closed in the fall of 2014). On February 23, 2013, Sahlins resigned from the National Academy of Sciences to protest the call for military research for improving the effectiveness of small combat groups and also the election of Napoleon Chagnon. The resignation followed the publication in that month of Chagnon&#x27;s memoir and widespread coverage of the memoir, including a profile of Chagnon in &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;.

Alongside his research and activism, Sahlins trained a host of students who went on to become prominent in the field. One such student, Gayle Rubin, said: &quot;Sahlins is a mesmerizing speaker and a brilliant thinker. By the time he finished the first lecture, I was hooked.&quot;

In 2001, Sahlins became publisher of Prickly Pear Pamphlets, which was started in 1993 by anthropologists Keith Hart and Anna Grimshaw, and was renamed Prickly Paradigm Press. The imprint specializes in small pamphlets on unconventional subjects in anthropology, critical theory, philosophy, and current events. He died on April 5, 2021, at the age of 90 in Chicago.

His brother was the writer and comedian Bernard Sahlins (1922–2013). His son, Peter Sahlins, is a historian.

==Work==
Sahlins is known for theorizing the interaction of structure and agency, his critiques of reductive theories of human nature (economic and biological, in particular), and his demonstrations of the power that culture has to shape people&#x27;s perceptions and actions. Although his focus has been the entire Pacific, Sahlins has done most of his research in Fiji (especially the island of Moala) and Hawaii.

===Early work===
Sahlins&#x27;s training under Leslie White, a proponent of materialist and evolutionary anthropology at the University of Michigan, is reflected in his early work. His 1958 book &quot;Social Stratification in Polynesia&quot; offered a materialist account of Polynesian cultures. In his &quot;Evolution and Culture&quot; (1960), he touched on the areas of cultural evolution and neoevolutionism. He divided the evolution of societies into &quot;general&quot; and &quot;specific&quot;. General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organization and adaptiveness to environment. However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a diffusion of their qualities (like technological inventions). This leads cultures to develop in different ways (specific evolution), as various elements are introduced to them in different combinations and on different stages of evolution. &quot;Moala&quot;, Sahlins&#x27;s first major monograph, exemplifies this approach.

===Contributions to economic anthropology===
&quot;Stone Age Economics&quot; (1972) collects some of Sahlins&#x27;s key essays in substantivist economic anthropology. As opposed to &quot;formalists,&quot; substantivists insist that economic life is produced through cultural rules that govern the production and distribution of goods, and therefore any understanding of economic life has to start from cultural principles, and not from the assumption that the economy is made up of independently acting, &quot;economically rational&quot; individuals. Perhaps Sahlins&#x27;s most famous essay from the collection, &quot;The Original Affluent Society,&quot; elaborates on this theme through an extended meditation on &quot;hunter-gatherer&quot; societies. &quot;Stone Age Economics&quot; inaugurated Sahlins&#x27;s persistent critique of the discipline of economics, particularly in its Neoclassical form.

===Contributions to historical anthropology===
After the publication of &quot;Culture and Practical Reason&quot; in 1976, his focus shifted to the relation between history and anthropology, and the way different cultures understand and make history. Of central concern in this work is the problem of historical transformation, which structuralist approaches could not adequately account for. Sahlins developed the concept of the &quot;structure of the conjuncture&quot; to grapple with the problem of structure and agency, in other words that societies were shaped by the complex conjuncture of a variety of forces, or structures. Earlier evolutionary models, by contrast, claimed that culture arose as an adaptation to the natural environment. Crucially, in Sahlins&#x27;s formulation, individuals have the agency to make history. Sometimes their position gives them power by placing them at the top of a political hierarchy. At other times, the structure of the conjuncture, a potent or fortuitous mixture of forces, enables people to transform history. This element of chance and contingency makes a science of these conjunctures impossible, though comparative study can enable some generalizations. &quot;Historical Metaphors and Mythical Realities&quot; (1981), &quot;Islands of History&quot; (1985), &quot;Anahulu&quot; (1992), and &quot;Apologies to Thucydides&quot; (2004) contain his main contributions to historical anthropology.

&quot;Islands of History&quot; sparked a notable debate with Gananath Obeyesekere over the details of Captain James Cook&#x27;s death in the Hawaiian Islands in 1779. At the heart of the debate was how to understand the rationality of indigenous people. Obeyesekere insisted that indigenous people thought in essentially the same way as Westerners and was concerned that any argument otherwise would paint them as &quot;irrational&quot; and &quot;uncivilized&quot;. In contrast Sahlins argued that each culture may have different types of rationality that make sense of the world by focusing on different patterns and explain them within specific cultural narratives, and that assuming that all cultures lead to a single rational view is a form of eurocentrism.

===Centrality of culture===
Over the years, Sahlins took aim at various forms of economic determinism (mentioned above) and also biological determinism, or the idea that human culture is a by-product of biological processes. His major critique of sociobiology is contained in &quot;The Use and Abuse of Biology&quot;. His 2013 book, &quot;What Kinship Is—And Is Not&quot; picks up some of these threads to show how kinship organizes sexuality and human reproduction rather than the other way around. In other words, biology does not determine kinship. Rather, the experience of &quot;mutuality of being&quot; that we call kinship is a cultural phenomenon.

Sahlins&#x27;s final book was &quot;The New Science of the Enchanted Universe: An Anthropology of Most of Humanity.&quot; The book explores the worldwide phenomenon of &quot;meta-persons.&quot; A reviewer defined metapersons as &quot;supreme gods and minor deities, ancestral spirits, demons, indwelling souls in animals and plants—who act as the intimate, everyday agents of human success or ruin, whether in agriculture, hunting, procreation, or politics.&quot;
