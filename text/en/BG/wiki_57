<text>The 1994 K Foundation award was an award given by the K Foundation (Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty) to the &quot;worst artist of the year&quot;. The shortlist for the £40,000 K Foundation award was identical to the shortlist for the well-established but controversial £20,000 Turner Prize for the best British contemporary artist. On the evening of 23 November 1993, Rachel Whiteread was presented with the 1993 Turner Prize inside London&#x27;s Tate Gallery, and the 1994 K Foundation award on the street outside.

Prior to presenting their award, the K Foundation held a private exhibit of a collection of art works entitled &quot;Money - A Major Body of Cash&quot;. The award, the exhibition and the accompanying extravagant press junket were widely reported by the media.

==Context==
In June 1993 the newly formed K Foundation began taking out full page national press adverts. Initial advertisements were cryptic, referring to &quot;K Time&quot; and advising readers to &quot;Kick out the clocks&quot;. They mentioned five-year journeys which included pop success and deep space travel and that &quot;the sands of time are running in&quot;. There was also an advert for the K Foundation&#x27;s single &quot;K Cera Cera&quot; which was &quot;Available nowhere ... no formats&quot; and which was not planned for release until world peace was established.

 There was a change of direction with the fourth advert which appeared on 14 August 1993, reading: &quot;ABANDON ALL ART NOW. Major rethink in progress. Await further announcements.&quot; The next ad (28 August 1993) read: &quot;It has come to our attention that you did not abandon all art now. Further direct action is thus necessary. The K Foundation announce the &#x27;mutha of all awards&#x27;, the 1994 K Foundation award for the worst artist of the year.&quot; It then went on to detail how a shortlist of four artists had been chosen, and that they would be exhibited in the Tate Gallery.

One of the first newspaper pieces about the K Foundation appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot; the following Monday, correctly pointing out that the shortlist and exhibition were actually for the 1993 Turner Prize, the controversial £20,000 annual award given by the UK art establishment to the best young contemporary artist, but assuming that the K Foundation prize was a hoax. &quot;As for the K Foundation&quot;, the newspaper wrote, &quot;it stands unmasked as the current performing face of those cherished old friends of pop pranksterdom, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty&quot;, formerly known as The KLF. In September, the organisers of the Turner Prize responded publicly that &quot;It proves the validity of our prize that somebody would take so much trouble to set up this award&quot;.

The Foundation&#x27;s next advert invited the general public to vote for the worst artist, either by going to the exhibition and using their critical faculties or by letting their inherent prejudices come to the fore. The final advert summarised the whole campaign, asked some questions back to the people that had written to them, and explained that the winner of the K Foundation award would be announced in a TV advert during the live Turner Prize coverage on Channel 4 television.

On 20 November 1993, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported on the K Foundation prize and placed it in context. &quot;Every autumn for the past ten years, an increasingly bad-tempered squabble has raged between, on the one hand, many of Britain&#x27;s art critics and its popular media, and on the other, its avant-garde &quot;establishment,&quot; the small coterie of art historians, curators, and dealers who control the Turner prize.&quot; Predicting that Rachel Whiteread, creator of the controversial sculpture &quot;House&quot;, would win both awards, the magazine said that, if it were so, &quot;the vast numbers of people who equate contemporary art with rubbish will, yet again, feel vindicated.&quot;
The K Foundation&#x27;s television adverts on the evening of 23 November 1993 explained that the Foundation were currently &quot;amending the history of art&quot; at a secret location. No mention of the alternative award was made in the post-Turner Prize studio discussion. The K Foundation reportedly pre-announced Rachel Whiteread as their winner at some time before the Turner Prize winner was announced; at 9.30pm, live on television, the Turner Prize was awarded to the same artist. Whiteread reluctantly collected her K Foundation winnings at just past 11pm, saying, &quot;sarcastically, &#x27;What an honour.&#x27;&quot;

Drummond claimed the advertising campaign cost £250,000. The television advertisements cost £20,000, an amount which &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; said was &quot;carefully chosen to match the value of the Turner prize&quot;, the newspaper adding that &quot;Copies of the invoices were supplied as evidence.&quot; Each press advert cost between £5,000 and £15,000.

== The Amending of Art History ==

25 witnesses - including art critics, journalists, music industry figures and artists - were invited to participate in the Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Amending of art history&quot;. They were driven in a convoy of white limousines, led by a gold limo, to Heston Service Station where they were handed a press release and £1650 in crisp new £50 notes. The accompanying press release stated that 25 × £1600 collectively made up the £40000 K Foundation prize, and that the extra £50 was for the witness to verify its authenticity by spending it. The witnesses were dressed in fluorescent orange hard hats and safety jackets.

The convoy proceeded to a field patrolled by two orange-painted K Foundation Saracen armoured cars, driven by Drummond and Cauty, broadcasting the K Foundation&#x27;s &quot;K Cera Cera&quot; and ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Money Money Money&quot;. Silver-bearded &quot;Mr Ball&quot;, the K Foundation&#x27;s compere, directed the witnesses to nail their wad of money to a board inside a gilt frame, to assemble the K Foundation&#x27;s prize. Some of the witnesses pocketed all or some of their wad, and the prize money was, according to Danny Kelly, some £9000 short. Mr Ball also directed the witnesses to &quot;view the art&quot;: One million pounds in £50 notes, nailed to a large framed board. This was the K Foundation&#x27;s first art work, &quot;Nailed To The Wall&quot;, &quot;the first of a series of K Foundation art installations that will also include one million pounds in a skip, one million pounds on a table and several variants on the theme of Tremendous Amounts Of Folding&quot;.

Collectively, the K Foundation&#x27;s money-as-art works were titled &quot;Money: A Major Body Of Cash&quot;, &quot;seven pieces, all involving various amounts of cash nailed to, tied to or simply standing on inanimate objects&quot;. &quot;Nailed To The Wall&quot; had a reserve price of £500,000, half the face value of the cash used in its construction, which &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;&#x27;s reporter Robert Dawson Scott was &quot;fairly confident... really was £1 million [in cash]&quot;. The catalogue entry for the artwork stated: &quot;Over the years the face value will be eroded by inflation, while the artistic value will rise and rise. The precise point at which the artistic value will overtake the face value is unknown. Deconstruct the work now and you double your money. Hang it on a wall and watch the face value erode, the market value fluctuate, and the artistic value soar. The choice is yours.&quot;

Rachel Whiteread had already been notified of her &quot;victory&quot; but had refused to accept the prize or allow the K Foundation to use her name. The motorcade left the site of the amending of art-history and headed back to London, for a showdown with Whiteread on the steps of the Tate. When she again refused to accept the money, the K Foundation explained that it would be burnt. With the crowd of now very drunk witnesses looking on, a masked K Foundation operative (Gimpo) fumbled with matches and lighter fluid. At the last moment Rachel Whiteread emerged from the Tate and accepted the money, stating that she would give it as grants to needy artists.

==Media and art-world reaction==
A huge amount of press publicity ensued, with all the major newspapers and press organisations reporting that Whiteread had won both awards. Media reaction to the K Foundation award was mixed. David Mills wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; that The K Foundation&#x27;s campaign was &quot;tiresome&quot;, and he asked &quot;Doesn&#x27;t it strike anyone as odd that a group of people who made their money with such artistic endeavours as a disco-version of the Dr Who theme should be suggesting that contemporary art was somehow more fatuous than that?&quot;
Rachel Whiteread had an advertisement printed in the British magazine, &quot;Art Monthly&quot;, in which she outlined her plan to donate £10,000 to Shelter and distribute the remainder in grants to 10 needy artists. In the advertisement Whiteread stated that she &quot;does not agree with the K Foundation&#x27;s aims or methods&quot;; the advertisement was in a similar style to the K Foundation ads, with stark white text on a black background.

Defending Whiteread, Lord Palumbo told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that: &quot;Talent at the highest level attracts derision. We must let the artist fail.&quot; Scottish sculptor David Mach opined to &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; that &quot;They&#x27;re just a bunch of silly buggers. It&#x27;s good to see money going from a bunch of silly buggers to an artist who is going to make good use of it. What&#x27;s that saying about a fool and his money...?&quot; John Bellany, on the other hand, said that &quot;The emotional, artistic side of [his] nature... admire[d] the audacity and imagination, challenging art and the art manipulators. The rational side of me asks, is this the most expensive art publicity stunt this century, and for whom?&quot;

Whiteread&#x27;s agent Karsten Schubert said, &quot;The whole affair was a non-event. They achieved nothing and they were left looking like real prats.&quot; Peter Chater, a director of Schubert&#x27;s agency concurred; he called Drummond and Cauty &quot;cowards&quot;. &quot;It was obviously a publicity stunt. What sort of statement they were trying to make I don&#x27;t know. If it was anything to do with the relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren&#x27;t in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene.&quot; Former Factory Records boss Tony Wilson applauded the group, however. &quot;The K Foundation is a very peculiar avant garde group whose ideas are as valid as anything the Turner people do,&quot; he told &quot;NME&quot;. &quot;Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, so a lot of people don&#x27;t understand what Bill and Jimmy are trying to say, but how many people know exactly what Rachel Whiteread&#x27;s trying to say with her art?&quot;

&quot;Modern Review&quot; art critic John O&#x27;Reilly, another of the K Foundation&#x27;s witnesses, said: &quot;The whole point of the K Foundation is its anonymity. There&#x27;s no origin, just a Circulation of data and concepts. There is no master plan, no grand narrative.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly also &quot;[enjoyed the] sense of waste and sacrifice involved&quot;.

Miranda Sawyer, who attended the presentation, found special interest in a subsidiary incident during the evening of the prize ceremonies: the theft of money by several of the other invited witnesses: &quot;All the feelings of power and powerlessness that money can bring were fairly summarised with these thefts - it must have turned out better than the K Foundation could have hoped if the examination of cash, art and associated feelings was their point.&quot; Sawyer named &quot;Britart&quot; figure Carl Freedman as one of those who had taken the money, and reported that &quot;He found the event funny, not offensive (you would too if you walked off with £1,600!), but thought the point had been made before.&quot;

Writer and &quot;underground art historian&quot; Stewart Home was viciously supportive of the K Foundation. &quot;The avant-garde wasn&#x27;t to be seen at the Turner Prize gathering, it was to be found among that select band of individuals who&#x27;d organised the K Foundation&#x27;s attack on the smug complacency of the arts establishment... &#x27;dignitaries&#x27; such as Lord Polumbo were revealed as buffoons. While Polumbo ranted about the dunces who attack cultural innovations, his rhetoric showed him to be a complete idiot — several people immediately pointed out that he was unable to correctly name Van Gogh&#x27;s art dealer brother. Likewise, Polumbo claimed that there are no monuments erected to critics and presented himself as a champion of progressive culture, while ignoring the fact that it was critics who picked the winner of the prize he was awarding. It is the K Foundation, rather than Whiteread, who represent a vital and innovative strand within contemporary culture. Their work is simultaneously a critique and a celebration of &#x27;consumer capitalism&#x27;.&quot;

An &quot;NME&quot; piece on 20 November 1993 was also highly supportive of the K Foundation. &quot;The nearest parallel to the K Foundation donation would be The Beatles&#x27; grandiose plans for Apple Corps&quot;, they said. &quot;But where Apple handed out money willy-nilly to little end and failed to achieve anything more than get some hippies stoned and put up some nice posters about war being over if you want it, Drummond and Cauty have found a specific target - the relationship between art, money and the critical establishment- and attacked it. By actually offering £40,000 to the artist who produces the duffest piece of work, they&#x27;ve simultaneously sent up the whole thing and proved their integrity the hard way.&quot;

&quot;The Face&quot; magazine&#x27;s witness, Cliff Jones, wrote that &quot;The accusation that this is a tiresome Situationist gag with a whoopee cushion pay-off belittles the K Foundation&#x27;s distracted message. They are not mocking any of the artists involved in the Turner or their work so much as the whole tired institution of awards themselves... By telling us to &quot;use our critical faculties or our innate prejudice&quot; to vote, the Ks are asking: &quot;Who decides who decides?&quot;&quot;

&quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s witness, David Lister, was less impressed. &quot;Last night&#x27;s highly eccentric mystery tour by the K Foundation probably said more about the wealth that can be accumulated from two number one hit records than it did about any resurgence of Dadaism&quot;, he said.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; said that Jimmy Cauty, &quot;[as the artist] responsible for a best-selling Athena poster of the Hobbit ... can justly say he has adorned more walls than any of the Turner nominees&quot;; and added: &quot;A grand deflation of the pretensions of the wealthy art elite is an aim that has drawn approval from sections of the art world and philistines who find &#x27;installations&#x27; of knotted rope or beds covered in rice curiously unmoving... The joke may yet prove to be at the expense of the Turner.&quot; In a separate piece, the newspaper implied that the K Foundation had hit their perceived target with some success:

Whiteread&#x27;s sculpture, &quot;House&quot;, was demolished, as had been planned from its inception, on 11 January 1994.

==Later analysis==
In a piece published in 2006, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; quoted author James F. English&#x27;s description of The K Foundation&#x27;s Art Award as &quot;hostile philanthropy&quot;. &quot;Sunday Times&quot; writer Bryan Appleyard added that the &quot;K Foundation&#x27;s witty exploitations of artistic greed ... are essential aspects of the prize itself. They promote the prize, reassure the organisers that, culturally speaking, they are in the thick of it and console the artists with evidence that their work provokes strong reactions. More importantly, for English, such conflicts demonstrate the autonomous nature of the event. These prizes should not be seen as any real or lasting judgment about art, but rather as things in themselves.&quot;

Some years after the award, Bill Drummond attempted to explain the K Foundation&#x27;s motives, as he now saw them:
==Burning==
The K Foundation&#x27;s art campaign, &quot;Money: A Major Body Of Cash&quot;, failed to attract major gallery interest so, on 23 August 1994, Drummond and Cauty disposed of their one million pounds in an alternate fashion: they burnt it on the Scottish island of Jura. In an interview with Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo, Gimpo admitted to harbouring guilt about the million pounds burning; that if he&#x27;d burnt Whiteread&#x27;s £40,000 the million pounds burning would never have happened. &quot;I should have burnt it. I had petrol all over the £40,000... We were due to wait until eleven o&#x27;clock until she came out, but we were told to wait another two minutes... [then] Rachel Whiteread came running out. She just grabbed the money and dragged it over the fence.&quot; Carl Freedman also wished they&#x27;d burnt Whiteread&#x27;s money. &quot;It would have been brilliant... It would have been just totally outrageous. People would have been falling out of their-chairs, saying. &#x27;I can&#x27;t believe they just burned £40,000&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Strangford Lough () is a large sea lough or inlet in County Down, in the east of Northern Ireland. It is the largest inlet in Ireland and the wider British Isles, covering . The lough is almost fully enclosed by the Ards Peninsula and is linked to the Irish Sea by a long narrow channel at its southeastern edge. The main body of the lough has at least seventy islands along with many islets (pladdies), bays, coves, headlands and mudflats. It is part of the Strangford and Lecale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Strangford Lough was designated as Northern Ireland&#x27;s first Marine Conservation Zone in 2013, and has been designated a Special Area of Conservation for its important wildlife.

Strangford Lough is a popular tourist destination noted for its fishing and scenery. Towns and villages around the lough include Killyleagh, Comber, Newtownards, Portaferry and Strangford. The latter two straddle either shore of the narrow Strangford channel, and are connected by a car ferry.

==Name==
The name &quot;Strangford&quot; comes from the Old Norse &quot;Strangfjörthr&quot;, meaning &quot;strong fjord&quot; or rather &quot;fjord of the strong current&quot;. Originally it referred to the channel linking the lough to the sea, between the villages of Strangford and Portaferry, but it was extended to the lough as a whole from the 17th century onwards. The lough had previously been known as &quot;Lough Cone&quot; or &quot;Lough Coyne&quot; in English, from the Irish &quot;Loch Cuan&quot; (&quot;lough of the harbours&quot;).

==Geology==
The lough was formed at the end of the last ice age and is generally under deep, but can reach in parts, generally the centre channel.

==Flora==
===Flowering plants===

Common cord-grass (&quot;Spartina anglica&quot;) C.E. Hubbard, introduced in the mid-1940s, is now abundant.

===Algae===
Maerl is a calcareous deposit, in the main, of two species, of calcareous algae &quot;Phymatolithon calcareum&quot; and &quot;Lithothamnion glaciale&quot; which form free-living beds of unattached, branched corallines, living or dead, in Strangford Lough.

The rocky and boulder shores toward the south of the lough are dominated by the seaweed knotted wrack &quot;Ascophyllum nodosum&quot;. The usual zonation of weeds on these shore is, at the top channel wrack (&quot;Pelvetia canaliculata&quot; (L.) Dcne. et Rhur.), followed by spiral wrack (&quot;Fucus spiralis&quot; L.), then knotted wrack (&quot;Ascophyllum nodosum&quot; (L.) Le Jol) with some admixture of bladder wrack (&quot;Fucus vesiculosus&quot;) L. and then serrated wrack (&quot;Fucus serratus&quot; L.) before coming to the low water kelps.

Other algae include:
==Fauna==
Strangford Lough and Islands is an Important Bird Area.
Strangford Lough is an important winter migration destination for many wading and sea birds. Animals commonly found in the lough include common seals, basking sharks and brent geese. Three quarters of the world population of pale bellied brent geese spend winter in the lough area. Often the numbers are up to 15,000. The Castle Espie wetland reserve sits on the banks of the lough near Comber.

The invasive carpet sea squirt, &quot;Didemnum vexillum&quot;, was found in the Lough in 2012.

==Tidal electricity==

In 2007 Strangford Lough became home to the world&#x27;s first commercial tidal stream power station, SeaGen. The 1.2 megawatt underwater tidal electricity generator, part of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Environment and Renewable Energy Fund scheme, took advantage of the fast tidal flow in the lough which can be up to 4 m/s. Although the generator was powerful enough to power up to a thousand homes, the turbine had a minimal environmental impact, as it was almost entirely submerged, and the rotors turned slowly enough that they pose no danger to wildlife.

In 2008 a tidal energy device called Evopod was tested in Strangford Lough near the Portaferry Ferry landing. The device was a 1/10 scale prototype, monitored by Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. The device was a semi-submerged floating tidal turbine, moored to the seabed via a buoy-mounted swivel. The scale device was not grid connected.

==Sports==
In July 2016, the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership, Scottish Coastal Rowing Association, Newry, Mourne and Down District Council and Ards and North Down Borough Council hosted the &quot;Skiffie Worlds 2016&quot; rowing championships. The event was attended by 50 clubs from Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, The United States, Canada and Tasmania. Racing was held over a 2 km course on Strangford Lough at Delamont Country Park.

==Ferry==

The Portaferry–Strangford ferry service has linked Portaferry and Strangford, at the mouth of the Lough, without a break and for almost four centuries. The alternative road journey is and takes about an hour and a half, while the ferry crosses the strait in 8 minutes. The subsidised public service carries both passengers and vehicles, and operates at a loss of more than £1m per year but is viewed as an important transport link to the Ards Peninsula.

<doc id="316022" wikidata="Q593737" url="?curid=316022" title="Sestos">
<text>Sestos (, ) was an ancient city in Thrace. It was located at the Thracian Chersonese peninsula on the European coast of the Hellespont, opposite the ancient city of Abydos, and near the town of Eceabat in Turkey.

In Greek mythology, Sestos is presented in the myth of Hero and Leander as the home of Hero.

==History==
===Classical period===

Sestos is first mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; as a Thracian settlement, and was allied with Troy during the Trojan War. The city was settled by colonists from Lesbos in c. 600 BC. In c. 512, Sestos was occupied by the Achaemenid Empire, and Darius I ferried across from the city to Asia Minor after his Scythian campaign. Alongside Byzantium, Sestos was considered to be one of the foremost Achaemenid ports on the European coast of the Bosphorus and the Hellespont. In 480, at the onset of the Second Persian invasion of Greece, Xerxes I bridged the Hellespont near Sestos.

In 479 BC, after the Greek victory at the Battle of Mycale, Sestos was besieged by Athenian forces led by Xanthippus. The Greek siege was resisted by a joint force of Persian soldiers and the city&#x27;s native inhabitants and endured the whole winter, however, food supplies were inadequate as the siege was unexpected, and the city&#x27;s garrison suffered from famine. The garrison subsequently capitulated and the Persian soldiers were imprisoned. Artayctes, the Persian governor of Sestos, had escaped, but was captured and crucified. However, Athenian influence over Sestos lapsed briefly, according to Plutarch, as Cimon retook the city in a second campaign at some point between 478 and 471.

Sestos became a member of the Athenian-led Delian League, and was part of the Hellespontine district. The city contributed a &quot;phoros&quot; of 500 drachmas annually from 446/445 to 435/434, after which Sestos provided 1000 drachmas until 421/420. At Sestos, a 10 per cent tax was levied on westbound, non-Athenian, merchant grain ships. The city served as a base for the Athenian fleet until it was occupied by Spartan forces led by Lysander in 404, during the Peloponnesian War. Sestos&#x27; population was briefly expelled and replaced by Spartan settlers, but the city&#x27;s native inhabitants were permitted to return to the city soon after.

During the Corinthian War, Sestos was occupied by Athenian forces led by Conon in 393, and the city came under the control of Ariobarzanes, Satrap of Phrygia. In 365, an attack on Sestos by Cotys I, King of Thrace, was repelled with the aid of Timotheus, for which Athens was awarded with Sestos and Krithotai in the same year. A cleruchy was established at Sestos in 364, but the city was conquered by Cotys I after a surprise attack in 360, and a Thracian garrison was established. The Athenian general Chares seized Sestos in 353 and carried out &quot;andrapodismos&quot; whereby the male population was killed and women and children were enslaved; the city was repopulated by Athenian cleruchs.

===Hellenistic period===

Sestos remained under Athenian control until the Peace of 337 and dissolution of the Second Athenian League, after which Sestos joined the Macedonian-led League of Corinth. Alexander the Great, King of Macedonia, crossed over from Sestos to Asia Minor in 334 BC. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323, the city, alongside other Macedonian dependencies in Thrace, was allocated to Lysimachus as a result of the Partition of Babylon. The mint of Sestos was established in c. 300 BC. Lysimachus retained control of the city until his death at the battle of Corupedium in 281.

The city was seized by Philip V, King of Macedonia, in 200 BC, and remained under Macedonian control until the conclusion of the Second Macedonian War in 196 with the Peace of Flamininus, which proclaimed Sestos a free city. In 196 BC, during the Roman–Seleucid War, Sestos surrendered to Antiochus III, &quot;Megas Basileus&quot; of the Seleucid Empire, who refortified the city in 191 in preparation for a Roman attack, only for the city to surrender to Gaius Livius Salinator in 190. At the end of the war, the Treaty of Apamea of 188 awarded Sestos to the Kingdom of Pergamon. By the end of the Hellenistic period, the offices of &quot;gymnasiarch&quot; and of &quot;ephebarch&quot;, with responsibility for the &quot;neoi&quot; (young) and &quot;epheboi&quot; (adolescents), are attested at Sestos.

===Roman period===
Upon the death of Attalus III, King of Pergamon, in 133 BC, Sestos was annexed to the Roman Republic after Aristonicus, a pretender to the throne, had been defeated. The city was mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Canon Urbium Insignium&quot;. The mint of Sestos ceased to function in c. 250 AD. It is believed that Sestos, with Abydos and Lampsacus, is referred to as one of the &quot;three large capital cities&quot; of the Roman Empire in &quot;Weilüe&quot;, a 3rd-century AD Chinese text. Gaius Julius Solinus in &quot;Collectanea rerum memorabilium&quot; also makes reference to the city.

By late antiquity, the harbour of Sestos had silted up. In 447 AD, Sestos was sacked by the Huns. The city was damaged by an earthquake during the reign of Emperor Zeno in 478 AD. In the 6th century, according to Procopius&#x27; &quot;De Aedificiis&quot;, Emperor Justinian I refortified Sestos.

===Medieval period===
It is believed that Sestos is referred to as Ṣāṣah in the &quot;Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eyes&quot;, an 11th-century Arabic treatise. By the 13th century AD, the crossing from Lampsacus to Kallipolis had become more common and largely replaced the crossing from Sestos to Abydos. The fortress on the site of Sestos was later named Choiridokastron (pig castle), and was captured by Ottoman Turks led by Süleyman Pasha in 1355. According to Enveri&#x27;s &quot;Dusturname&quot;, Choiridokastron was the first settlement in Europe to be conquered by the Ottoman Turks, whereas Aşıkpaşazade recorded that the fortress was attacked by Ottoman forces, after the fall of Tzympe.

<doc id="316023" wikidata="Q1319944" url="?curid=316023" title="The White Room (KLF album)">
<text>The White Room is the fourth and final studio album by British electronic music group the KLF, released on 4 March 1991. The album features versions of the band&#x27;s hit singles, including &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot;, &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot;, and &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot;.

Originally scheduled for 1989 as the soundtrack to a film of the same name, the album&#x27;s direction was changed after both the film and the original soundtrack LP were cancelled. Most tracks on the original album version are present in the final 1991 release, though in significantly remixed form. &quot;The White Room&quot; was supposed to be followed by a darker, harder complementary album &quot;The Black Room&quot;, but that plan was abandoned when the KLF retired in 1992.

On 23 April 2021, a re-edited version of the album was officially released on streaming platforms, in a series of digital reissues, as &quot;The White Room (Director&#x27;s Cut)&quot;, featuring new edits of original tracks from 1989 to 1990 sessions.

==Background==
&quot;The White Room&quot; was conceived as the soundtrack to a road movie, also called &quot;The White Room&quot;, about the KLF&#x27;s search for the mystical White Room that would enable them to be released from their contract with Eternity. Parts of the movie were filmed in the Sierra Nevada region of Spain, using the money that Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, under the alias &quot;The Timelords&quot;, had made with their 1988 number-one hit &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot;. The soundtrack album contained pop-house versions of some of the KLF&#x27;s earlier &quot;Pure Trance&quot; singles, as well as new songs.

The film project was fraught with difficulties and setbacks, including dwindling funds. Drummond and Cauty had released &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot;, a single from the original soundtrack, in the hopes that it could &quot;rescue them from the jaws of bankruptcy&quot;; it flopped commercially, however, failing to make even the UK top 100. As a consequence, &quot;The White Room&quot; film project was put on hold, and the KLF abandoned the musical direction of the soundtrack and single. Neither the film nor the soundtrack album were formally released, although bootleg copies of both exist.

Meanwhile, the KLF&#x27;s single &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot;, which had originally been released in 1988 and largely ignored by the public, was generating acclaim within the underground clubs of continental Europe; according to KLF Communications, &quot;The KLF were being feted by all the &#x27;right&#x27; DJs&quot;. This prompted Drummond and Cauty to pursue the acid house tone of their &quot;Pure Trance&quot; series. A further &quot;Pure Trance&quot; release, &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot;, followed.

In October 1990, the KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound they dubbed &quot;Stadium House&quot;. Songs from &quot;The White Room&quot; soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled &quot;Additional Communicators&quot;), a sample-heavy pop-rock production, and crowd noise samples. The &quot;Stadium House&quot; versions of &quot;What Time Is Love?&quot; and &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot; were immediate hits, with &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot; becoming the KLF&#x27;s second, and the only one under the name, number-one release. These &quot;Stadium House&quot; tracks made up a large part of &quot;The White Room&quot; when it was eventually released in March 1991, substantially reworked from the original version. Aside from the singles, &quot;Make It Rain&quot;, &quot;Build a Fire&quot;, &quot;Church of the KLF&quot; and &quot;The White Room&quot; appeared in significantly more minimal, ambient and dub-oriented versions on the final album. &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; was reworked to become &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot;.

From the original record that was planned for release in 1989 as &quot;Tunes from the White Room&quot;, in 1997, a bootleg CD taken from a low-quality cassette rip was released and included some bonus tracks. A higher-quality version, allegedly created by someone who mastered the original album DAT in a professional studio, was hosted on a popular KLF fan site, KLF.de in the early 2000s.

== &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; ==
On 23 April 2021, &quot;The White Room (Director&#x27;s Cut)&quot; was officially released as the fourth part of the series of remastered digital compilations under the collective title &quot;Samplecity thru Trancentral&quot;. The album&#x27;s edition includes tracks from the unreleased 1989 album, plus versions of &quot;Madrugada Eterna&quot; and &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Writing for &quot;Select&quot;, Andrew Harrison praised &quot;The White Room&quot; as &quot;an enthralling album&quot; which &quot;plays a disconcerting game with the listener&#x27;s expectations of the commercial end of house.&quot; In &quot;Q&quot;, Iestyn George called the album &quot;strikingly imaginative&quot; and &quot;a more subtle form of subterfuge&quot; than previous works. Anthony Farthing of &quot;Sounds&quot; viewed it as &quot;a neat summation of Drummond and Cauty&#x27;s colourful history – it embraces their previous JAMs-related guises while still updating the Kopyright Liberation Front&#x27;s corporate identity.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Marisa Fox wrote that the album&#x27;s &quot;diverse music is too rich to be labeled&quot;, while &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau commented that the KLF &quot;like everything I like about house and are canny enough to can the boring parts.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; journalist James Brown, however, found the album &quot;insignificant and unadventurous&quot;, criticising its songs&#x27; lack of &quot;direction&quot; and &quot;hard substance&quot;.

In a retrospective review of the album, John Bush of AllMusic said that &quot;The White Room&quot; &quot;represents the commercial and artistic peak of late-&#x27;80s acid-house.&quot; Franklin Soults stated in the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; that on &quot;The White Room&quot;, &quot;the KLF became what they&#x27;d mocked with this enduring embrace of Euro-trash club culture. They knew their exit cue.&quot; &quot;Splendid&quot; magazine thought some of the tracks to be filler and the album &quot;silly&quot; in places, but were extremely impressed by the &quot;Stadium House&quot; songs. &quot;As providers of perverse, throwaway, three-minute pop-song manna,&quot; they concluded, &quot;the KLF were punk rock, the Renaissance, Andy Warhol and Jesus Christ all rolled into one.&quot;

In 1993, &quot;NME&quot; staff and contributors voted the album the 81st best of all time, and in 2000, &quot;Q&quot; listed it as the 89th best British album of all time. &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; listed &quot;The White Room&quot; in their &quot;Essential 100&quot;, and readers of Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Is this music?&quot; magazine voted the album the 44th best &quot;Scottish&quot; LP of all time. &quot;The White Room&quot; is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="316025" wikidata="Q47958" url="?curid=316025" title="Butters Stotch">
<text>Leopold &quot;Butters&quot; Stotch is a fictional character in the adult animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;. He is loosely based on co-producer Eric Stough and his voice is provided by co-creator Matt Stone. He is a student at South Park Elementary School.

Butters is depicted as more naive, optimistic, and gullible than the show&#x27;s other child characters and can become increasingly anxious, especially when faced with the likelihood of being grounded, of which he is extremely terrified. As a result, he is often sheltered and unknowledgeable of some of the suggestive content his peers understand, and is also frequently the victim of abuse and manipulation by Eric Cartman.

Butters debuted as an unnamed background character when &quot;South Park&quot; first premiered on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997. His role gradually increased, becoming one of the series&#x27;s most frequently present characters beginning with Season 3 and eventually the &quot;de facto&quot; fifth main character. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have stated that he is one of their favorite characters.

==Role in &quot;South Park&quot;==
Butters attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison&#x27;s (later Mrs. Garrison&#x27;s) 4th grade class. Storyboards and scripts for Seasons 1 and 2 had his original names as &quot;Puff Puff&quot; and &quot;Swanson&quot; respectively. In &quot;AWESOM-O&quot;, he says his birthday is on September 11. He learns from his parents in &quot;Going Native&quot; that he was born on the island of Kaua&#x27;i. During the show&#x27;s first 58 episodes (1997 through Season 4 episode &quot;4th Grade&quot; in 2000), Butters and the other main child characters were in the third grade. He lives in South Park as the only child and son of Stephen and Linda Stotch, from whom he perpetually faces the looming prospect of being grounded and abused. When the character of Kenny McCormick was temporarily written off the show near the end of Season 5, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman allow Butters into their group as the &quot;fourth friend&quot;, a role he continued to fill until midway through Season 6, namely, the episode &quot;Professor Chaos&quot;. During this period, the boys would often take advantage of Butters&#x27; mild temperament by making him a stooge in their own personal schemes, especially Cartman&#x27;s. The three eventually ousted him in favor of Tweek Tweak.

As a result, Butters vengefully adopted the alter ego of Professor Chaos. Intending to be a supervillain, Professor Chaos wears a green cape, and a helmet and gauntlets constructed out of cardboard and aluminum foil, a parody of Marvel Comics&#x27; Dr. Doom. Butters as Professor Chaos received much focus during the back-to-back episodes &quot;Professor Chaos&quot; and &quot;Simpsons Already Did It&quot;, where he took on his younger friend Dougie as his sidekick General Disarray and ultimately failed at their several ill-prepared attempts to create &quot;worldwide chaos&quot;. Professor Chaos has occasionally made a few appearances since, appearing to be a known supervillain to South Park&#x27;s police force.

Despite being displaced from both his role as the &quot;fourth friend&quot; and from the eventual return of Kenny, Butters has continued to be a major character in recent seasons and is still a good friend to the group. Formerly a social outcast in earlier episodes, he has nevertheless been seen spending considerable amount of time with the other children, and continues to be a frequent source of help to Cartman, while also being the main victim of Cartman&#x27;s pranks and manipulation: for instance, in the Season 11 episode &quot;Cartman Sucks&quot;, Cartman goes on numerous sleepovers with Butters so he can pull pranks on him in his sleep. Though the act is customarily performed by Stan or Kyle, Butters will occasionally reflect on the lessons he has attained during the course of an episode with a brief speech, and will sometimes muster up enough courage to act as the voice of reason when his parents or other adults in town engage in irrational behavior. However, in “Awesom-O”, Butters finally gets his revenge on Cartman by showing a videotape of him doing a Britney Spears dance routine to a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake to the whole town, humiliating Cartman. He is a main character in the new &#x27;Post Covid: the Return of Covid&#x27; special, living under the alias &#x27;Victor Chaos&#x27;. He has fully taken on the Professor Chaos role and makes a living by convincing people to invest in NFTs. He was Kenny McCormick&#x27;s right-hand man, making all of Kenny&#x27;s money by convincing people to invest in NFTs. He was also locked in a psychiatric hospital for his ability to convince people to invest their life savings into NFTs.

==Character==
===Creation and design===
On August 13, 1997, Butters first appeared as a background character when &quot;South Park&quot; debuted on Comedy Central with the episode &quot;Cartman Gets an Anal Probe&quot;. For the episode, the character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. Since then, like all other characters on the show, Butters has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique. In the tradition of the show&#x27;s animation style, Butters is composed of simple geometrical shapes and colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion. Butters has a large tuft of blond hair on top of his head, and is usually depicted wearing an aquamarine jacket with dark green pants and black shoes. While originally voicing Butters without any computer manipulation, Stone now speaks within his normal vocal range while adding a childlike inflection, a slight stutter, and a Southern accent. The recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.

===Development===
The character is loosely based on &quot;South Park&quot; co-producer Eric Stough, whom Stone and Parker regard as a &quot;goody-goody&quot; because of his reluctance to offend. The inspiration behind the major development of Butters was, in the words of Parker and Stone, Stough&#x27;s geeky behavior during their production of the 1999 &quot;South Park&quot; TV-to-Film adaptation &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;: singling out an instance in which Stough and fellow staff members left work early to view a screening of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, which irritated the aforementioned creators.

Parker and Stone then decided to parody Stough&#x27;s antics in the series by transferring it to the character of Butters and proceeding to write the episode &quot;Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub&quot;, which aired three weeks after &quot;Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; was released. The nickname &quot;Butters&quot; evolved from Parker and Stone calling Stough &quot;little buddy&quot; for about three years.
Prior to making his first major appearance in the Season 3 episode &quot;Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub&quot;, crew members referred to the character as &quot;Puff Puff&quot; and &quot;Swanson&quot;, the latter name which he was identified as in the Season 2 episode &quot;Conjoined Fetus Lady&quot;, and would continue to be addressed by the two names in storyboards and scripts until it was finalized as &quot;Butters&quot; in the aforementioned &quot;Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub&quot;.

Butters gradually became one of Parker and Stone&#x27;s favorite characters, and for the show&#x27;s Season 5 finale they created the episode
&quot;Butters&#x27; Very Own Episode&quot;, which revolves entirely around Butters and his parents. The intention was to give the character a proper introduction to the &quot;South Park&quot; audience and prepare them for the larger role he would come to play in further seasons. Butters eventually took part in more and more scenes in which he is paired with Cartman, and Parker declares that the scenes involving the two together are his favorite of the series. Butters had very little dialogue in the 1999 film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut&quot;, receiving only one line total, though he does utter some grunts and other sounds during some scenes. In a 2009 audio commentary for the Blu-ray edition of the film, Parker and Stone expressed shock at how little the character was used, and agreed that any &quot;South Park&quot; movie made today would demand he play a role in the plot.

===Personality and traits===
Though using profanity on occasion, Butters does not indulge in this language as often as the other children on the show, instead preferring to use minced oaths; &quot;oh hamburgers&quot; is one he uses frequently, as well as &quot;gee whiz&quot; mostly in earlier seasons. Butters speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as &quot;nerdy&quot;, and he obliviously maintains a wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters. He frequently sings songs containing the phrase &quot;loo loo loo&quot;. His happy-go-lucky persona has been described as resembling that of a typical 1950s sitcom child character, and is usually presented in stark contrast to the harsh treatment he receives at the hands of his friends and strict parents, including his mother&#x27;s deranged attempt to murder him after discovering his father&#x27;s bisexuality, as well as when his grandmother happens to be in town and constantly bullies him during her stay. Stone describes him as embodying &quot;permanent innocence&quot;. Butters, however, sees himself as a problem child because his parents tell him so and often expresses remorse at being &quot;out-of-control&quot;. Exceptions to this include the episode &quot;The Ungroundable&quot;, in which Butters makes his parents worry about their ability to ground him when he refuses to be punished. This rebellious behavior begins after he joins the vampire kids at his school, but ends when he helps the Goth kids burn down a Hot Topic store. On the Season 14 episode &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, Butters didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a Batman costume when hearing about David Carradine&#x27;s autoerotic asphyxiation death after testing positive for sex addiction.

Butters is also known for being gullible, quickly believing anything told to him by others and tending to do whatever he is told to do with little protest, no matter how ridiculous these things seem to be. As such, he is always made an unknowing accomplice in Cartman&#x27;s various devious schemes. There are cases, however, where Butters has shown a darker side, such as in episodes like &quot;The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs&quot; and &quot;Butterballs&quot;; in the latter of which he viciously assaulted Dr. Oz and verbally castigated his abusive grandmother.

==In other media==
Butters appears as a nameless background character with only one line in the 1999 film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;.

Butters plays a major role in the three-episode &quot;Imaginationland&quot; story arc, which was reissued straight-to-DVD as a full-length feature in 2008. Butters is the main playable character in &quot;South Park Imaginationland&quot;, a mobile game for the iPhone loosely based on the show&#x27;s &quot;Imaginationland&quot; trilogy of episodes. In the video game &quot;South Park Let&#x27;s Go Tower Defense Play!&quot;, Butters can be selected as a playable character used to establish a tower defense against the game&#x27;s antagonists.

He also appears in a major role as a companion fighter in the video game &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot;, where he plays as a paladin, where his abilities include healing, holy damage, and summoning Professor Chaos who can inflict a variety of status-affecting attacks on enemies or shielding the players. In the superhero-themed sequel &quot;South Park: The Fractured but Whole&quot;, he appears as Professor Chaos and is an antagonist and a playable character.

A DVD box set of 13 Butters-centric episodes, &quot;A Little Box of Butters&quot;, was released in September 2010.

A pinball game with a Butters theme, entitled &quot;Butters Very Own Pinball&quot; (named after the season five finale &quot;Butters&#x27; Very Own Episode&quot;), is playable on the mobile app video game &quot;South Park Pinball&quot;. This was also released by Zen Studios for &quot;Pinball FX2&quot; in October 2014, and later remastered for &quot;Pinball FX&quot; on October 12, 2023.

<doc id="316029" wikidata="Q3631506" url="?curid=316029" title="Habba Khatoon">
<text>Habba Khatoon (; born Zoon Rather () ; sometimes spelt Khatun), also known by the honorary title &quot;The Nightingale of Kashmir&quot;, was a Kashmiri Muslim poet and ascetic in the 16th century. She was the consort of King Yusuf Shah Chak, but attained immortality as the queen of song. 

Habba Khatoon&#x27;s music pushed her poetry gradually into learned circles and those who had fled on the works of immortals like Firdausi, Omar and Hafez were bound to raise their eyebrows at first. This wobbling of Habba Khatoon under her peculiar compulsions and with her own limitations created the symphony of romantic words running side by side with mystic poetry till it over stripped and outshone it.

==Early life==
Habba Khatoon as a figure has been introduced to generations of Kashmiris through folklore and oral traditions. She is said to have been born in the village of Chandur, () in the Pampore town of the Pulwama district in Kashmir. Her birth name was Zoon Rather or Zuni (). According to the oral tradition, she was called Zoon because of her immense beauty. Although a peasant, she learnt how to read and write from the village Alimah. 

Some circles who have disputed this fact associate her birth with the small glen of Gurez to the north of the valley of the Jhelum. Tradition links a spot near &quot;Tsoorawan&quot; in Gurez with the poet and it is known even now as the &#x27;hillock of Habba Khatoon&#x27;. They take their stand on a legend that Habba Khatoon was born to a petty chieftain in Gurez who passed her on to a Kashmiri trader &quot;Hayaband&quot; in lieu of the liquidation of his debts. &quot;Hayaband&quot; married her to his son &quot;Habalal&quot;, hence the name— Habba Khatoon. 

Yet, It is held that the &#x27;hillock&#x27; of Habba Khatoon came to be associated with her because of her later contacts when she visited Gurez as the consort of Yusuf Shah Chak. 

Abdi Rathar of Chandhur, her father, was a well-to-do farmer and was a man gifted with unusual courage and foresight. Notwithstanding the expected back-talk and open criticism, he made arrangements for the education of his daughter at the hands of a village maulvi. Habba Khatoon received instruction in the study of the Holy Quran and, of course, the Persian classics which, owing to the patronage at the court had become the rage of the times. No further details of this period of her life are available. Perhaps she read &quot;Gulistan and Bostan&quot; which was the usual fare of pupils in Persian in Kashmir till recently. However, her name spread well beyond the village boundaries and Abdi Rathar&#x27;s &quot;Zoon&quot; was referred to as an extraordinary child in hamlets other than Chandhur. 

In the course of time, her parents thought of marrying Zoon. Few girls could be better endowed for a happy married life. She came from a well-to-do family and was educated and accomplished. She was highly beautiful and could sing in a sweet, enchanting voice. She could work at home and on the farm to bring prosperity to her family. Her parents selected a peasant boy, Aziz Lone, as her husband. His tastes and interests had nothing in common with Zoon&#x27;s and there is hardly any doubt that he was a dull-witted, matter-of-fact a boorish young peasant. Nature tricked her into song and glory through Aziz Lone who was stolid to her charm and apathetic to her love. Despite this Habba Khatoon was fondly devoted to him in love and fidelity and left no stone unturned in trying to evoke a suitable response from her husband. With all her beauty of form and mellifluous voice she worked like a slave at her husband&#x27;s home and their lands. She would so to the stream to fetch water for the household, go to the uplands in search of firewood and wild edible roots, ply the spinning-wheel and do other chores in the tradition of the old times. But there was no appreciation for all this. Instead, her mother in-law and perhaps her husband too were always on the look out for a slip on her part-of course, innocent and unwitting to give them a handle to taunt her, abuse her and perhaps be labour her. If she broke an earthenware water-pot by accident she was asked to replace it or pay for a new one. 

The situation was pretty bad for her and she realized that life in such an atmosphere was worse than death. She could not make out how her death would profit him. In her song— &quot;&#x27;Tche Kyoho Vaatiyo Myaeni Marnai&quot;&#x27; (What do you stand to gain by my death?) contemplates such an act but concludes on a note of self-introspection but neither the display of emotion in abandon not admonition brought any relief to Zoon in her predicament and Aziz continued to be indifferent to her.
Translation: 

In such circumstances women approach saintly people credited with mystic powers for help. Zoon also must have sought the help of such men, among them one Khwaja Masud. He is said to have given her consolation and predicted a better future for her. He, it is said, also coined for her the name Habba Khatoon which Zoon adopted. But nothing brought even a streak of conjugal delight in the life of Habba Khatoon and she continued to address her laments to her husband.

One of her most famous songs &quot;Wolo Myaeni Poshay Madano&quot; (Come, my flowery Cupid) graphically representing the state of her mind at the time is surcharged with melancholy, bitterness against the wild talk of the people and vexation at the indifference of her husband. Her complaint is:
Translation: 

==Later life==
According to legend, one day Yousuf Shah Chak, the last independent emperor of Kashmir, was out hunting on horseback. He heard Zoon singing under the shade of a chinar tree, and the couple met and fell in love. The oral tradition describes Zoon as Yousuf Shah Chak&#x27;s queen consort, although there is scholarly debate about whether she was in fact a lower status mistress or member of his harem. She entered the palace in about 1570, and at some point changed her name to become Habba Khatoon (). 

Here was the young peasant woman slaving for her loaf, neglected and loathed by her husband, abhorred by his mother and a victim of people&#x27;s gossip, being entreated by the heir-apparent to take her exalted place in his palace. She had sought love from Aziz Lone which he denied her: she was in need of affection from his mother which she did not give; she expected normal regard and courtesy from society which treated her with disdain. And now she was being offered all this and more. Need less to say that she accepted the offer and entered the palace in circa 1570 Habba Khatoon was of an age when Kashmir suffered much political, social and economic distress. The dynasty of the Sultans distinguished by rulers like the mighty Shahab-ud-Din and the illustrious Zain-ul-Abdin had grown feeble and power passed into the hands of feudal barons who keenly competed with one another in the bid to exercise power in the name of a puppet here or a pretender there. 

Habib Shah, the last of the Sultans, was so weak and naive that in 1554 he was deprived of his crown while in full court and nobody raised even a little finger in his support. The throne was next occupied by Ali Khan, a member of the powerful Chak clan. Who are the Chaks? Whatever their origin, in course time, they seem to have settled in the Gilgit Hunza region as conquerors or refugees. Since then the region is known as Dardistan. But these Chaks entered Kashmir as refugees from Dardistan (Gilgit-Hunza region) in the reign of Sahadev (1305-34 A.D.) in the wake of their ruthless chief. Though energetic, Ali Khan Chak was intrepid and was occupied all the time in meeting revolts and confrontations. The Chaks were Shias and the brunt of their proselytising zeal fell on both the Hindus and the Sunni-Muslims. What was worse, the Sunni-Shia rivalry took an ugly turn and distressing form, leading to an extensive cleavage between the two sections of the population, and sympathies of the masses were alienated. A more serious development was the allurement felt by the hawk-eyed Mughal, Akbar, for the beautiful valley of Kashmir. Because of their mutual bickerings and quarrels, disgruntled Kashmiri leaders often sought assistance from the emperor, or his satraps, who encouraged defections and destabilisation. 

Habba Khatoon reached the palace when dark clouds of apathy and disdain were rolling against Kashmiri language and art. Another princess with a less forceful character would have found her sensibility smothered and perhaps fallen in line with the average literati in upholding Persian at the cost of Kashmiri. But Haba Khatoon&#x27;s devotion to her own language and culture proved stronger.

Yousuf Shah Chak had gained an invaluable treasure in Habba Khatoon, a paragon of beauty, and was deeply attached to her. He spent most of his time in her company, absorbed in her music and poetry. He brought about the fulfilment of her frozen love and became the focus of her life, her gratitude and her devotion. Towns and villages were no longer enough to satisfy the craving of the royal couple and they sought the company of nature in its naked beauty, matchless grandeur and unparalleled sublimity. The credit for the discovery of the far-famed queen of the hills, Gulmarg, is given to Yusuf Shah and his consort who spent much of their leisure in its sylvan glades. They patronised such pleasure spots as Aharabal, Achabal and Sonamarg. They sought enjoyment of hature as far away as the Gurais valley where a hillock has been named after Habba Khatoon. Some of these pleasure spots, especially Ahrabal and Achabal of the Pir Panjal region, attained celebrity in the reign of Jehangir subsequently. 

== The fall of Chaks ==
Ghazi Chak, the first Chak Sultan of Kashmir had a fiery temper which made him excessively unbearable and obnoxious to his subjects. The Emperor Akbar despatched Mirza Qara Bahadur, at the head of a large body of troops to invade the country in order to deliver its inhabitants from the yoke of the tyrant. The army of Qara Bahadur was defeated. The fact remains that this defeat demoralised the Mughals to such an extent that for another 25 years Akbar made no serious attempt to capture Kashmir. In spite of annex the valley continued unabated. Ghazi Shah&#x27;s body was leprous and after his campaign in Ladakh it became worse and he abdicated in favour of his brother Hussain Khan Shah whom he found master of the situation. Hussain Shah was a poet and, it was said, a man of liberal and secular views but Akbar was watching the condition in Kashmir and his agents sent reports to him. Many selfish and disgruntled leaders, often at loggerheads with each other, sought help from the Emperor. 

The Mughals were consolidating their hold on the Indian sub-continent during the second half of the sixteenth century and their eyes now turned to Kashmir. Yusuf Shah Chak who ascended the throne in 1579 A.D. did not display the leadership that was the need of the hour and internal feuds took such a serious turn that he lost the throne in 1580 when he had been king for only a year and two months. With his overthrow the wheel of Habba Khatoon&#x27;s fortunes changed. Yusuf made several attempts to regain the throne but could make no progress. Within six months there was another occupant on the throne and Yusuf continued to be confined to the wings. At last, he approached the emperor Akbar for armed assistance. Akbar who was watching the developments with no unconcern gave asylum to the fugitive prince and attached him to the grand army. Thereafter he practically slept over Yusuf&#x27;s plea for assistance to recover his lost kingdom. It was an unexpected trial of Yusuf&#x27;s diplomacy and perseverance. At home Habba Khatoon was forlorn. Yusuf had left Kashmir with high hopes of returning in a few weeks with Mughal troops and funds to fight the enemies and recover his throne. But weeks slipped by, months, and yet Habba Khatoon had no indication that of him coming back. The absence of her husband once a again raised in her mind the spectre of her beloved being snatched from her. Her intense love would not let her rest in peace while Yusuf was away. Then Akbar helped Yusuf Shah Chak who gave his escort Raja Man Singh a slip and recovered the kingdom of Kashmir after a series of manoeuvres at Sopore in 1581 A.D. 

Though later in the year 1586 A.D the Mughals marched into Kashmir and finally annexed it. 

She lived after Yusuf&#x27;s exit from Kashmir for nearly twenty years, or such is the tradition, moving from place to place with no attachments or possessions. Probably, she composed lyrics also but the hankering in her heart has been stilled. There is sorrow in her wail, there is regret and there is bitterness, but there is also resignation. 

In her wailing song for her lost husband— &quot;Harmukh Bartal&quot; she recites:

==Poetic tradition==
Persian influence had started making in-roads upon Kashmiri long before Habba Khatoon but the specimens of her Kashmiri lyrics give hardly any instances of her accepting it with eyes shut. Words of Persian origin have been sparingly used in her lyrics. Most of those we come across, e.g., &quot;shamaa&quot;&#x27; (candle), &quot;ishq&quot; (love), &quot;burqa&quot; (veil), &quot;aab&quot; (water) were already naturalised in the language of the people long before her advent. Use of the language actually spoken by the majority of men and women does not in any way detract from her poetry. On the other hand it gains in the power communication and appeal and impresses the reader/listener as sincere and artless, sweet and musical. It has to be conceded that it creates an impact of verisimilitude on the reader who discovers in her lyrics the strength and variety of his mother tongue unaided by other influences.

Habba Khatoon consciously made use of Persian in reviving Kashmiri music which had suffered neglect for lack of patronage. Yousuf Shah being a patron of art and music, Habba Khatoon was trained by renowned practitioners in rendering ghazals and songs in the Iranian style. Gifted as she was with a remarkable intelligence and a rare, melodious voice, she became in her own right a musician of note even among Persian masters. Kashmiri music cultivated by Harshdev of the 12th century and others had come heavily under the influence of Persian and Central Asian music with a variety of exotic instruments in play. Since Habba Khatoon was an adept in both it was only natural that she made her own contribution and she did so in the form of a new musical composition known as &quot;raasti-kashmiri&quot;, on the model of raasti farsi, which is sung in the last quarter of the night. She also earned renown in displaying her mastery over one Persian raga known as &quot;muqaami-Iraq&quot;. Her poems &quot;Harmukh Bartal&quot;, &quot;Char kar myon maalinyo&quot;, &quot;Vaervain saeth vaar chas no&quot; and many others are wailings known as &quot;Yadhaaq&quot; in Kashmiri.

==Legacy==
The taqleqkar (pioneer) of &quot;loal&quot; poetry has been praised by Kalhana in his book- Rajtarangini:
 The hillock in Gurez Valley, Kashmir is named after Habba Khatoon.

An underpass in Mughalpura, Lahore has been named after Habba Khatoon. The Indian Coast Guard named the ship CGS &quot;Habba Khatoon&quot; after her.

<text>The Black Room is an unfinished studio album recorded by the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty), intended to be the follow-up to their KLF album &quot;The White Room&quot;.

==History==
&quot;The Black Room&quot; was referred to in interviews even before &quot;The White Room&quot; was released. Originally it was planned to be hardcore techno (in the style of and featuring the original version of &quot;It&#x27;s Grim Up North&quot;), then electro-metal (like &quot;America: What Time Is Love?&quot;) and finally it was to be a thrash-metal collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror. It is unknown how much of each incarnation was complete before it was scrapped and recording was restarted.

Jimmy Cauty said of it in December 1990: &quot;The &#x27;Black Room&#x27; album will all be this kind of electro turbo metal. It&#x27;s not really industrial like, say, Throbbing Gristle, because it&#x27;s coming from house and has an uplifting vibe about it. But it&#x27;s so heavy it will just pin you to the floor.&quot; Bill Drummond said of it in 1991: &quot;It&#x27;s the complete yang to the yin of &quot;The White Room&quot;. It&#x27;ll be very very dense, very very hardcore. No sort of &#x27;up&#x27; choruses or anthems. I think it&#x27;s going to be techno-metal, I think that&#x27;s gonna be the sound. Techno-metal. Which&#x27;ll be... a cross between techno and heavy metal. Megadeth with drum machines.&quot;

At some point, grindcore band Extreme Noise Terror (ENT) were employed, and the two bands were still recording in February 1992 when the KLF scrapped the sessions. &quot;What actually happened,&quot; said ENT singer Dean, &quot;was that Bill heard us on [John] Peel when he was in the bath and got in touch. They had wanted to do rock versions of their songs with Motörhead but something fell through, so he rang us... The message said it&#x27;s Bill from The KLF, but I thought they said &#x27;the ALF&#x27; so I didn&#x27;t take much notice... Later, we got another message saying it was definitely Bill from The KLF and I said &#x27;fuck off! What does he want with us?&#x27; But it all got explained eventually.&quot; Asked how they found working with &quot;the pop genius of the age&quot;, the band agreed on a party line: &quot;Just say that he&#x27;s mad, barking bleedin&#x27; mad...&quot;

Mark Stent, the engineer/producer for these sessions, thought the music was pure genius. &quot;The most awesome track for me was one called &#x27;The Black Room and Terminator 10&#x27; which was like a very slow tempo thrash. It was mad. It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant, and it would have shown a lot of people up because it was as ballsy as hell. Guitars screaming all over the place, Bill doing his vocals and Dean (of ENT) doing his. There was such a raw power to it. It was so different from anything anyone else had ever heard. This was really heavy.&quot; 

One track was released from this collaboration, a metal version of &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot;. The two bands also performed together at the 1992 Brit Awards ceremony, a performance which &quot;NME&quot; listed at number 4 in their &quot;top 100 rock moments&quot;. However, the rest of the album was never completed and remains unreleased.

==&quot;Bad Wisdom&quot;==
In &quot;Bad Wisdom&quot;, Drummond writes:
==Bootlegs==
Instrumental outtakes purportedly from the February 1992 &quot;Black Room&quot; sessions circulate. However, they have been impossible to verify since they are guitar parts only and feature none of Drummond&#x27;s vocals. Asked if the sessions would ever be released, Cauty said &quot;There is a bootleg flying around. I haven&#x27;t heard it. I thought I had the only copy, but I guess there might have been another one made.&quot;

<text>A blue moon refers either to the presence of a second full moon in a calendar month, to the third full moon in a season containing four, or to a moon that appears blue due to atmospheric effects.

The calendrical meaning of &quot;blue moon&quot; is unconnected to the other meanings. It is often referred to as “traditional”, but since no occurrences are known prior to 1937 it is better described as an invented tradition or “modern American folklore”. The practice of designating the second full moon in a month as &quot;blue&quot; originated with amateur astronomer James Hugh Pruett in 1946. It does not come from Native American lunar tradition, as is sometimes supposed.

The moon - not necessarily full - can sometimes appear blue due to atmospheric emissions from large forest fires or volcanoes, though the phenomenon is rare and unpredictable (hence the saying “once in a blue moon”). A calendrical blue moon (by Pruett&#x27;s definition) is predictable and relatively common, happening 7 times in every 19 years (i.e. once every 2 or 3 years). Calendrical blue moons occur because the time between successive full moons (approximately 29.5 days) is shorter than the average calendar month. They are of no astronomical or historical significance, and are not a product of actual lunisolar timekeeping or intercalation.

==Phrase origin==

A 1528 satire, &quot;Rede Me and Be Nott Wrothe&quot;, contained the lines, “Yf they saye the mone is belewe / We must beleve that it is true.” The intended sense was of an absurd belief, like the moon being made of cheese. There is nothing to connect it with the later metaphorical or calendrical meanings of “blue moon”. However, a confusion of &quot;belewe&quot; (Middle English, “blue”) with &quot;belǽwan&quot; (Old English “to betray”)) led to a false etymology for the calendrical term that remains widely circulated, despite its originator having acknowledged it as groundless.

Percy Bysshe Shelley’s poem &quot;Alastor&quot; (1816) mentioned an erupting volcano and a “blue moon / Low in the west.” It was written at a time when the eruption of Mount Tambora was causing global climate effects, and not long before the first recorded instances of “blue moon” as a metaphor.

The OED cites Pierce Egan’s &quot;Real Life in London&quot; (1821) as the earliest known occurrence of “blue moon” in the metaphorical sense of a long time. (“How&#x27;s Harry and Ben?—haven&#x27;t seen you this blue moon.”) An 1823 revision of Francis Grose’s ‘’Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue’’, edited by Egan, included the definition: “Blue moon. In allusion to a long time before such a circumstance happens. ‘O yes, in a blue moon.’” An earlier (1811) version of the same dictionary had not included the phrase, so it was likely coined some time in the 1810s. &quot;Once in a blue moon&quot; is recorded from 1833.

The use of blue moon to mean a specific calendrical event dates from 1937, when the &quot;Maine Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; used the term in a slightly different sense from the one now in common use. According to the OED, “Earlier occurrences of the sense given in the &quot;Maine Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; have not been traced, either in editions of the Almanac prior to 1937, or elsewhere; the source of this application of the term (if it is not a coinage by the editor, H. P. Trefethen) is unclear.” The conjecture of editorial invention is further supported by the spurious explanation the almanac gave:

The Moon usually comes full twelve times in a year, three times in each
season... However, occasionally the moon comes full thirteen times in a year.
This was considered a very unfortunate circumstance, especially by the
monks who had charge of the calendar. It became necessary for them
to make a calendar of thirteen months, and it upset the regular arrangement
of church festivals. For this reason thirteen came to be considered an
unlucky number. Also, this extra moon had a way of coming in each of
the seasons so that it could not be given a name appropriate to the time
of year like the other moons. It was usually called the Blue Moon... In olden times the almanac
makers had much difficulty calculating the occurrence of the Blue Moon
and this uncertainty gave rise to the expression &quot;Once in a Blue Moon&quot;.

There is no evidence that an extra moon in a month, season or year was considered unlucky, or that it led to 13 being considered unlucky, or that the extra moon was called &quot;blue&quot;, or that it led to the phrase &quot;once in a blue moon&quot;. There is good reason to suspect that the 1937 article was a hoax, practical joke, or simply misinformed. It is however true that the date of the Christian festival of Easter depended on an accurate computation of full moon dates, and important work was done by the monks Dionysius Exiguus and Bede, explained by the latter in The Reckoning of Time, written c725 CE. According to Bede, “Whenever it was a common year, [the Anglo-Saxons] gave three lunar months to each season. When an embolismic year occurred (that is, one of 13 lunar months) they assigned the extra month to summer, so that three months together bore the name ‘‘Litha’’; hence they called [the embolismic] year ‘‘Thrilithi’’. It had four summer months, with the usual three for the other seasons.” The name Litha is now applied by some Neo-Pagans to midsummer.

The 1937 &quot;Maine Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; article was misinterpreted by James Hugh Pruett in a 1946 &quot;Sky and Telescope article&quot;, leading to the calendrical definition of “blue moon” that is now most commonly used, i.e. the second full moon in a calendar month. “A blue moon in the original &quot;Maine Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; sense can only occur in the months of February, May, August, and November. In the later sense, one can occur in any month except February.&quot; This later sense gained currency from its use in a United States radio programme, &quot;StarDate&quot; on January 31, 1980 and in a question in the &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; game in 1986.

Several songs have been titled &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, seen as a &quot;symbol of sadness and loneliness.&quot;

==Visually blue moon==
The moon (and sun) can appear blue under certain atmospheric conditions – for instance, if volcanic eruptions or large-scale fires release particles into the atmosphere of just the right size to preferentially scatter red light. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, scattering is the cause of “that epitome of rare occurrences, the blue Moon (seen when forest fires produce clouds composed of small droplets of organic compounds).” 

A Royal Society report on the 1883 Krakatoa eruption gave a detailed account of “blue, green, and other coloured appearances of the sun and moon” seen in many places for months afterwards.. The report mentioned that in February 1884 an observer in central America saw the crescent moon as “a magnificent emerald-green” while its ashen part was “pale green”. Venus, bright stars and a comet were also green. The report authors suspected that green moons were a contrast effect, since in those cases the surrounding sky was seen as red.

People saw blue moons in 1983 after the eruption of the El Chichón volcano in Mexico, and there are reports of blue moons caused by Mount St. Helens in 1980 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991.

The moon looked blue after forest fires in Sweden and Canada in 1950 and 1951, On September 23, 1950, several muskeg fires that had been smoldering for several years in Alberta, Canada, suddenly blew up into major—and very smoky—fires. Winds carried the smoke eastward and southward with unusual speed, and the conditions of the fire produced large quantities of oily droplets of just the right size (about 1micrometre in diameter) to scatter red and yellow light. Wherever the smoke cleared enough so that the sun was visible, it was lavender or blue. Ontario, Canada, and much of the east coast of the United States were affected by the following day, and two days later, observers in Britain reported an indigo sun in smoke-dimmed skies, followed by an equally blue moon that evening.

Ice particles might have a similar effect. The Antarctic diary of Robert Falcon Scott for July 11, 1911 mentioned &quot;the air thick with snow, and the moon a vague blue&quot;.

The key to a blue moon is having many particles slightly wider than the wavelength of red light (0.7 micrometer)—and no other sizes present. Ash and dust clouds thrown into the atmosphere by fires and storms usually contain a mixture of particles with a wide range of sizes, with most smaller than 1 micrometer, and they tend to scatter blue light. This kind of cloud makes the moon turn red; thus red moons are far more common than blue moons.

== Calendrical blue moon ==
Blue moon as a calendrical term originated with the 1937 &quot;Maine Farmers’ Almanac&quot;, a provincial U.S. magazine that is not to be confused with the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot;, &quot;Old Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, or other American almanacs. There is no evidence of “blue moon” having been used as a specific calendrical term before 1937, and it was possibly invented by the magazine’s editor, Henry Porter Trefethen (1887-1957). As a term for the second full moon in a calendar month it began to be widely known in the U.S. in the mid-1980s and became internationally known in the late 1990s when calendrical matters were of special interest given the approaching millennium. It created a misapprehension that the calendrical meaning of “blue moon” had preceded the metaphorical one, and inspired various folk etymologies, e.g. the “betrayer” speculation mentioned earlier, or that it came from a printing convention in calendars or a saying in Czech. A 1997 Taiwanese movie, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, had the log line “There is usually only one full moon every month, but occasionally there are two – and that second full moon is called the Blue Moon. It is said that when a person sees a blue moon and makes a wish, he will be granted a second chance in things.”

In 1999 folklorist Philip Hiscock presented a timeline for the calendrical term. First, the August page of the 1937 &quot;Maine Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; ran a sidebar claiming that the term was used “in olden times” for an extra full moon in a season, and gave some examples (21 November 1915, 22 August 1918, 21 May 1921, 20 February 1924, 21 November 1934, 22 August 1937, and 21 May 1940). Six years later, Laurence J. Lafleur (1907-66) quoted the almanac in the U.S. magazine &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; (July 1943, page 17) in answer to a reader’s question about the meaning of “blue moon”. Then James Hugh Pruett (1886-1955) quoted it again in &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; (March 1946, p3), saying “seven times in 19 years there were — and still are — 13 full moons in a year. This gives 11 months with one full moon each and one with two. This second in a month, so I interpret it, was called Blue Moon”. In 1980 the term was used (with Pruett’s definition) in a U.S. radio program, &quot;Star Date&quot;, and in 1985 it appeared in a U.S. children’s book, &quot;The Kids&#x27; World Almanac of Records and Facts&quot; (“What is a blue moon? When there are two full moons in a month, the second one is called a blue moon. It is a rare occurrence.”) In 1986 it was included as a question in Trivial Pursuit (likely taken from the children’s book), and in 1988 a forthcoming blue moon received widespread press coverage.

In 1999 U.S. astronomer Donald W. Olson researched the original articles and published the results in a &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; article co-authored with Richard T Fienberg and Roger W. Sinnott. From the examples given by Trefethen in the 1937 &quot;Maine Farmers’ Almanac&quot; they deduced a “rule” he must effectively have used. “Seasonal Moon names are assigned near the spring equinox in accordance with the ecclesiastical rules for determining the dates of Easter and Lent. The beginnings of summer, fall, and winter are determined by the dynamical mean Sun. When a season contains four full Moons, the third is called a Blue Moon.” They termed this the “Maine rule” for blue moons, as distinct from Pruett’s 1946 definition that was seen to have been a misinterpretation.

In popular astronomy the Maine rule is sometimes called the “seasonal”, “true” or “traditional” rule (though of course no tradition of it exists prior to 1937). Blue moons by Pruett’s definition are sometimes called “calendar blue moons”. The &quot;seasonal&quot; blue moon rule is itself ambiguous since it depends which definition of season is used. The Maine rule used seasons of equal length with the ecclesiastical equinox (March 21). An alternative is to use the astronomical seasons, which are of unequal length.

There is also reference in modern popular astrology to “zodiacal blue moons”.

===Blue moon dates===
The table below has blue moon dates and times (UTC) calculated according to Pruett’s “calendar” rule (second full moon in a calendar month) and two versions of the “seasonal” rule (third full moon in a season with four). The Maine rule uses equal-length seasons defined by the dynamical mean sun, and is presumed to have been the original rule of Trefethen. The “astro-seasonal” rule uses the unequal astronomical seasons defined by the apparent sun. All calculations are by David Harper.

The fourth column shows blue moon dates that were actually printed in the &quot;Maine Farmers’ Almanac&quot;, as found by Olson, Fienberg and Sinnott in 1999. They studied issues published between 1819 and 1962, and found that all mentions occurred between 1937, when H.P. Trefethen introduced the term, and 1956, when Trefethen’s editorship ended (consistent with it being Trefethen’s own invention). Occasional discrepancies between the Maine rule and the almanac’s printed dates can be ascribed to clerical errors or miscalculation. In one case (August 1945) Trefethen appears to have used the apparent rather than mean sun.

The table shows that in 200 years there are 187 full moons that could be called &quot;blue&quot; by some definition - an average of nearly one per year. Two Pruett blue moons can occur in a single year (1915, 1961, 1999, 2018, 2037, 2094). 1915 had four blue moons (two Pruett, one Maine, one astro-seasonal). 1934 and 2048 have three (one of each type).

Despite the 187 blue moons appearing across the 200 years in this table, only 146 years have any of these 3 types of blue moons, leaving 54 years (thus averaging just over 1 year in every 4) which have none of the 3 rules represented in that calendar year.

While not totally unexpected (given the overlapping frequencies of these 3 rules), it so happens there are not any 2 sequential years (at least within these 200) wherein none of the 3 types of blue moon occur.

Conversely, despite the preponderance of years with blue moons (of at least 1 type) occurring in this 200-year range, there are no instances of more than 4 sequential years having a blue moon, of any of these 3 types -- i.e. at least 1 year out of every 5 sequential years has none of the 3 types appearing.

===Remarks===

One lunation (an average lunar cycle) is 29.53 days. There are about 365.24 days in a tropical year. Therefore, about 12.37 lunations (365.24 days divided by 29.53 days) occur in a tropical year. So the date of the full moon falls back by nearly one day every calendar month on average. Each calendar year contains roughly 11 days more than the number of days in 12 lunar cycles, so every two or three years (seven times in the 19 year Metonic cycle), there is an extra full moon in the year. The extra full moon necessarily falls in one of the four seasons (however defined), giving that season four full moons instead of the usual three.

Given that a year is approximately 365.2425 days and a synodic orbit is 29.5309 days, then there are about 12.368 synodic months in a year. For this to add up to another full month would take 1/0.368 years. Thus it would take about 2.716 years, or 2 years, 8 months, and 18 days for another Pruett blue moon to occur. Or approximately once in 32.5 months on an average.

When there are two Pruett blue moons in a single year, the first occurs in January and the second in March or April, and there is no full moon in February. 

The next time New Year&#x27;s Eve falls on a Pruett blue moon (as occurred on December 31, 2009 in time zones west of UTC+05) is after one Metonic cycle, in 2028 in time zones west of UTC+08. At that time there will be a total lunar eclipse.

<text>In combinatorial game theory, a game is partisan (sometimes partizan) if it is not impartial. That is, some moves are available to one player and not to the other, or the payoffs are not symmetric.

Most games are partisan. For example, in chess, only one player can move the white pieces. More strongly, when analyzed using combinatorial game theory, many chess positions have values that cannot be expressed as the value of an impartial game, for instance when one side has a number of extra tempos that can be used to put the other side into zugzwang.

Partisan games are more difficult to analyze than impartial games, as the Sprague–Grundy theorem does not apply. However, the application of combinatorial game theory to partisan games allows the significance of &quot;numbers as games&quot; to be seen, in a way that is not possible with impartial games.

<text>A dog whistle (also known as silent whistle or Galton&#x27;s whistle) is a type of whistle that emits sound in the ultrasonic range, which humans cannot hear but some other animals can, including dogs and domestic cats, and is used in their training. It was invented in 1876 by Francis Galton and is mentioned in his book &quot;Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development&quot;, in which he describes experiments to test the range of frequencies that could be heard by various animals, such as a house cat.

The upper limit of the human hearing range is about 20 kilohertz (kHz) for children, declining to 15–17 kHz for middle-age adults. The top end of a dog&#x27;s hearing range is about 45 kHz, while a cat&#x27;s is 64 kHz. It is thought that the wild ancestors of cats and dogs evolved this higher hearing range in order to hear high-frequency sounds made by their preferred prey, small rodents. The frequency of most dog whistles is within the range of 23 to 54 kHz, so they are above the range of human hearing, although some are adjustable down into the audible range.

To human ears, dog whistles only emit a quiet hissing sound. The principal advantage of dog whistles is that they do not produce a loud, potentially irritating noise for humans that a normal whistle would produce and thus can be used to train or command animals without disturbing nearby people. Some dog whistles have adjustable sliders for active control of the frequency produced. Trainers may use the whistle simply to get a dog&#x27;s attention or to inflict pain for the purpose of behaviour modification.

In addition to lung-powered whistles, there are also electronic dog whistle devices that emit ultrasonic sound via piezoelectric emitters. The electronic variety are sometimes coupled with bark-detection circuits in an effort to curb barking behaviour. This kind of whistle can also be used to determine the hearing range for people and for physics demonstrations requiring ultrasonic sounds.

<doc id="316048" wikidata="Q56412931" url="?curid=316048" title="Cleveland Elementary School shooting (San Diego)">
<text>The Cleveland Elementary School shooting was a school shooting that took place on January 29, 1979, at Grover Cleveland Elementary School in San Diego, California, United States. The principal and a custodian were killed; eight children and police officer Robert Robb were injured. A 16-year-old girl, Brenda Spencer, who lived in a house across the street from the school, was convicted of the shootings. Charged as an adult, she pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and assault with a deadly weapon, resulting in her being sentenced to life in prison with a chance of parole after 25 years. As of 2025, she is still in prison. 

Brenda Spencer is often regarded as the first modern school shooter in the United States. A reporter reached her by phone while she was still in the house after the shooting, and asked her why she committed the crime. She reportedly answered: &quot;I don&#x27;t like Mondays. This livens up the day.&quot;

== Perpetrator ==
Brenda Ann Spencer (born April 3, 1962) was born to Dorothy Nadine (née Hobel) and Wallace Edward Spencer. They married on December 12, 1954, in Chula Vista and had three children. Brenda was the youngest. In January 1972, after Dorothy found out her husband had been cheating on her with multiple women, she filed for divorce.

After her parents separated, Brenda allegedly lived in poverty with her father. Both father and daughter slept on a single mattress on the living room floor, in a house strewn with empty bottles from alcoholic drinks. At later parole hearings, she claimed to have been subject to &quot;total neglect&quot; from her mother and sexual abuse from her father. The accusations have been disputed by the respective parents. At the time, she lived in a house across the street from the school. Aged 16 at the time of the shooting, she was 5&#x27;2&quot; (157 cm) and had bright red hair.

Acquaintances said Spencer expressed hostility toward policemen, had spoken about shooting one, and had talked of doing something big to get on television. Although Spencer showed ability as a photographer, winning first place in a Humane Society competition, she was generally uninterested in school. She attended Patrick Henry High School, where one teacher recalled frequently inquiring if she was awake in class. Later, during tests while she was in custody, it was discovered that Spencer had an injury to one of the temporal lobes of her brain. It was attributed to an accident on her bicycle.

Spencer described herself as a &quot;radical&quot; and referred to policemen as &quot;pigs&quot;, exclaiming &quot;All right!&quot; when seeing news on TV about police officers being killed and often talking about wanting to kill police officers or &quot;blow them away&quot;. Some classmates described her as &quot;crazy&quot; and reported being scared of her.

In early 1978, staff at a facility for problem students, into which Spencer had been referred for truancy, informed her parents that she was suicidal. That summer, Spencer, who was known to hunt birds in the neighborhood, was arrested for shooting out the windows of Grover Cleveland Elementary with a BB gun and for burglary. Police reports and eyewitnesses do not mention the use of a BB gun during the school vandalism.

In December 1978, prior to the shooting, while still on probation for breaking into the school, a psychiatric evaluation arranged by her probation officer recommended that Spencer be admitted to a mental hospital for depression. Her father refused to give permission. For Christmas 1978, he gave her a Ruger 10/22 semi-automatic .22 caliber rifle with a telescopic sight and 500 rounds of ammunition. Spencer later said, &quot;I asked for a radio and got a rifle.&quot; Asked why he had done that, she answered, &quot;He bought the rifle so I would kill myself.&quot;

== Shooting ==
On the morning of Monday, January 29, 1979, Spencer began shooting from her house at children waiting for 53-year-old Principal Burton Wragg to open the gates to Grover Cleveland Elementary. She injured eight children; she began with nine-year-old Cam Miller, since he was wearing Spencer&#x27;s favorite color, blue. Spencer shot and killed Wragg as he and teacher Daryl Barnes tried to help children. She also killed 56-year-old custodian Mike Suchar as he tried to pull a student to safety. A 28-year-old police officer, Robert Robb, had responded to a call for assistance during the incident, where he was wounded in the neck as he arrived.

Further casualties were avoided only because the police obstructed her line of fire by moving a garbage truck in front of the school entrance.

After firing thirty-six times, Spencer barricaded herself inside her home for several hours. While there, she spoke by telephone to a reporter from &quot;The Evening Tribune&quot;, who had been randomly calling telephone numbers in the neighborhood. Spencer told the reporter she had shot at the school children and adults because, &quot;I don&#x27;t like Mondays. This livens up the day.&quot; She also told police negotiators the children and adults whom she had shot were easy targets and that she was going to &quot;come out shooting&quot;. Spencer has been repeatedly reminded of these statements at parole hearings. Ultimately, she surrendered and left the house, reportedly after being promised a Burger King meal by negotiators.

=== Analysis ===
Several accounts identify the Cleveland Elementary School shooting in San Diego as the earliest recorded elementary school shooting in the United States. The perpetrator, Brenda Spencer, is often regarded as the first modern high-profile school shooter. According to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, her actions marked a significant turning point in American history, with some referring to Spencer as “the mother” of subsequent school shootings, including those at Columbine and Newtown. The school shooting trend has increased since 1979.

San Diego County Deputy District Attorney Richard Sachs noted that Spencer “hurt so many people and had so much to do with starting a deadly trend in America.” In a 2001 statement, Spencer acknowledged the potential influence of her actions on later incidents, remarking, “With every school shooting, I feel I’m partially responsible. What if they got the idea from what I did?”

== Imprisonment ==
Spencer was charged as an adult. She pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and assault with a deadly weapon. On April 4, 1980, a day after her 18th birthday, she was sentenced to concurrent terms of 25 years to life in prison. Nine counts of attempted murder were dismissed. In prison, Spencer was diagnosed with epilepsy and received medication to treat epilepsy and depression. While at California Institution for Women in Chino, she worked repairing electronic equipment.

Under the terms of her sentencing, Spencer became eligible for hearings to consider her suitability for parole in 1993.

At her first hearing, in 1993, Spencer said she had hoped police would shoot her, and that she had been a user of alcohol and drugs at the time of the crime, although the results of drug tests done when she was taken into custody were negative. At her 2001 parole hearing, Spencer claimed that her father had been subjecting her to beatings and sexual abuse, but he said the allegations were not true. The parole board chairman said that, as she had not previously told anyone about the allegations, he doubted their veracity. 

In 2005, a San Diego deputy district attorney cited an incident of self-harm from four years earlier, when Spencer&#x27;s girlfriend was released from jail, as showing that Spencer was psychotic and unfit to be released. Early reports indicated that Spencer had scratched the words &quot;courage&quot; and &quot;pride&quot; into her own skin; Spencer corrected this during her parole hearing as reading &quot;unforgiven&quot; and &quot;alone&quot;.

In 2009, the board again refused her application for parole, and ruled it would be ten years before she would be considered again. In August 2022, Spencer and the Board of Parole Hearings agreed that she was not suitable for parole and that she would not be eligible for another hearing for another three years as a result of this parole suitability denial. In February 2025, she was denied parole once more. She remains imprisoned at California Institution for Women in Chino. Her next opportunity for a parole hearing will be in 2028.

== Aftermath ==
A plaque and flagpole were erected at Cleveland Elementary in memory of the shooting victims. The school was closed in 1983, along with a dozen other schools around the city, due to declining enrollment. In the ensuing decades, it was leased to several charter and private schools. From 2005 to 2017, it housed the Magnolia Science Academy, a public charter middle school serving students in grades 6–8. In 2018, the school was demolished to construct a housing development, and the plaque was relocated to the former school&#x27;s southern edge, at the corner of Lake Atlin Avenue and Lake Angela Drive.

In the months following the shooting, one of Brenda Spencer&#x27;s first cellmates, a 17-year-old girl, moved in with Spencer&#x27;s father, eventually marrying him on March 26, 1980, in Yuma, Arizona. They had a daughter together, after which she fled the household and eventually divorced, leaving Wallace Spencer to raise their child alone. Wallace Spencer died in February 2016.

On January 17, 1989, almost ten years after the events at San Diego&#x27;s Grover Cleveland Elementary, there was another shooting at a school coincidentally named Grover Cleveland Elementary, this one in Stockton, California. Five students were killed and thirty were injured. Christy Buell, a survivor of the 1979 shooting, said that she was &quot;shocked, saddened, horrified&quot; by the headlines concerning the 1989 shooting.

== Media ==
=== Song ===
Bob Geldof, then the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, read about the incident when a news story about it came off the telex at WRAS-FM, the campus radio station at Georgia State University in Atlanta. He was particularly struck by Spencer&#x27;s claim that she did it because she did not like Mondays, and began writing a song about it, called &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot;. It was released in July 1979, was number one for four weeks in the United Kingdom, and was the band&#x27;s biggest hit in their native Ireland. 

Although it did not make the Top 40 in the U.S., it still received extensive radio airplay (outside of the San Diego area) despite the Spencer family&#x27;s efforts to prevent it. Geldof later claimed that &quot;[Spencer] wrote to me saying &#x27;she was glad she&#x27;d done it because I&#x27;d made her famous,&#x27; which is not a good thing to live with&quot;, though Spencer denies ever contacting Geldof.

=== Films and television ===
The 1981 Japanese–American documentary film &quot;The Killing of America&quot; depicts the incident. The 2006 British documentary &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot; also revisits the case.

The Investigation Discovery network portrayed Spencer&#x27;s crimes in one of the three cases presented in the premiere episode of season 2 on the crime documentary series &quot;Deadly Women&quot;, titled &quot;Thrill Killers&quot;, which aired in October 2008.

The Lifetime Movies series &quot;Killer Kids&quot; released an episode &quot;Deadly Compulsion&quot; depicting Spencer&#x27;s crimes, which first aired in September 2014.

<doc id="316050" wikidata="Q7750235" url="?curid=316050" title="The Manual">
<text>The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way) is a 1988 book by &quot;The Timelords&quot; (Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond), better known as The KLF. It is a step-by-step guide to achieving a No. 1 single with no money or musical skills, and a case study of the duo&#x27;s UK novelty pop No. 1 &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot;.

==How to have a number one==
The advice dispensed by The Manual includes: &quot;Firstly, you must be and on the dole. Anybody with a proper job or tied up with full time education will not have the time to devote to see it through... Being on the dole gives you a clearer perspective on how much of society is run... having no money sharpens the wits. Forces you never to make the wrong decision. There is no safety net to catch you when you fall.&quot; and &quot;If you are already a musician stop playing your instrument. Even better, sell the junk.&quot; The book also foretells its own imminent irrelevance, The Timelords admitting that they are writing &quot;a book that will be completely redundant within twelve months. An obsolete artefact. Its only use being a bit of a social history that records the aspirations of a certain strata in British society in the late eighties...&quot;

The book was prophetic about recording technology: &quot;It&#x27;s obvious that in a very short space of time the Japanese will have delivered the technology and then brought the price of it down so that you can do the whole thing at home. Then you will be able to sod off all that crap about going into studios.&quot;

Bill Drummond explained his motivations in an interview: &quot;It was an excuse to say a lot of things I wanted to say about how the industry worked. It was an excuse to go out and say to people all they can say to themselves: If you want to do something, go and do it! Don&#x27;t wait to be asked, don&#x27;t wait for a record company to come and want to sign you or a management company. Just go and do it. Also, it was saying: If you wanna have number one...you can have it. It won&#x27;t make you rich, it won&#x27;t make you happy, but you can have it.&quot;

==Influence and reach==
The English-language version of &quot;The Manual&quot; has had at least 3 print runs, being reissued in 1989 and, with a new foreword by Drummond, in 1998. The book has also been translated into German, and was released as an audiobook (read by Bela B., drummer of the punk band Die Ärzte) in Germany in 2003, with Drummond voicing the foreword, a motivational piece about reaching out for one&#x27;s dreams today as ‘tomorrow is always too late’. In 2010, the book was published in Czech.

The Austrian dance music band Edelweiss took the book as a primary influence: they read the book, borrowed ABBA&#x27;s &quot;SOS&quot;, and sold five million copies worldwide with &quot;Bring Me Edelweiss&quot;. It also proved to be an influence on 2000s British girl group The Pipettes who formed after reading the book in order to explore &quot;the idea of being a pop machine.&quot;

Jamie Reynolds of Klaxons admitted in an interview to reading &quot;The Manual&quot; and stated that he &quot;took direct instructions from it... Get yourself a studio, get a groove going, sing some absolute nonsense over the top, put a breakbeat behind it, and you&#x27;re away! That&#x27;s what I did! That&#x27;s genuinely it. I read that, I noted down the golden rules of pop, and applied that to what we&#x27;re doing and made sure that that always applies to everything we do. That way, we always come out with a sort of catchy hit number.&quot;

<text>Dalbergia is a large genus of small to medium-size trees, shrubs and lianas in the pea family, Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae. It was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic &quot;Dalbergia&quot; clade (or tribe): the Dalbergieae. The genus has a wide distribution, native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, Africa, Madagascar and Southern Asia.

==Fossil record==
A fossil †&quot;Dalbergia phleboptera&quot; seed pod has been found in a Chattian deposit, in the municipality of Aix-en-Provence in France. Fossils of †&quot;Dalbergia nostratum&quot; have been found in rhyodacite tuff of Lower Miocene age in Southern Slovakia near the town of Lučenec. Fossil seed pods of †&quot;Dalbergia mecsekense&quot; have been found in a Sarmatian deposit in Hungary. †&quot;Dalbergia lucida&quot; fossils have been described from the Xiaolongtan Formation of late Miocene age in Kaiyuan County, Yunnan Province, China.

==Uses==
Many species of &quot;Dalbergia&quot; are important timber trees, valued for their decorative and often fragrant wood, rich in aromatic oils. The most famous of these are the rosewoods, so-named because of the smell of the timber when cut, but several other valuable woods are yielded by the genus.

Species such as &quot;Dalbergia nigra&quot; known as Rio, Bahia, Brazilian rosewood, palisander de Rio Grande, or jacaranda and &quot;Dalbergia latifolia&quot; known as (East) Indian Rosewood or Sonokeling have been heavily used in furniture and musical instruments, given their colour and grain. Several East Asian species are important materials in traditional Chinese furniture.

The (Brazilian) tulipwood (&quot;D. decipularis&quot;) is cream coloured with red or salmon stripes. It is most often used in crossbanding and other veneers; it should not be confused with the &quot;tulipwood&quot; of the American tulip tree &quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;, used in inexpensive cabinetwork.

The similarly used (but purple with darker stripes), and also Brazilian, kingwood is yielded by &quot;D. cearensis&quot;. Both are smallish to medium-sized trees, to 10 m. Another notable timber is cocobolo, mainly from &quot;D. retusa&quot;, a Central American timber with spectacular decorative orange red figure on freshly cut surfaces which slowly fades in air to more subdued tones and hues.

&quot;Dalbergia sissoo&quot; (Indian rosewood) is primarily used for furniture in northern India. Its export is highly regulated due to recent high rates of tree death due to unknown causes. &quot;Dalbergia sissoo&quot; has historically been the primary rosewood species of northern India. This wood is strong and tough, with color golden to dark brown. It is extremely durable and handsome, and it maintains its shape well. It can be easily seasoned. It is difficult to work, but it takes a fine polish. It is used for high quality furniture, plywoods, bridge piles, sporting goods, and railway sleepers. It is a very good material for decorative work and carvings. Its density is 770 kg/m3.

African blackwood (&quot;D. melanoxylon&quot;) is an intensely black wood in demand for making woodwind musical instruments.

&quot;Dalbergia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Bucculatrix mendax&quot; which feeds exclusively on &quot;Dalbergia sissoo&quot;.

The &quot;Dalbergia&quot; species are notorious for causing allergic reactions due to the presence of sensitizing quinones in the wood.

==Conservation==
All &quot;Dalbergia&quot; species are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). All but &quot;Dalbergia nigra&quot; are listed in Appendix II, with &quot;D.nigra&quot; listed in Appendix I.

<text>The provinces of Italy ( ; sing.  ) are the second-level administrative divisions of the Italian Republic, on an intermediate level between a municipality () and a region (). Since 2015, provinces have been classified as &quot;institutional bodies of second level&quot;.

There are currently 107 institutional bodies of second level in Italy, including 80 ordinary provinces, 2 autonomous provinces, 4 regional decentralization entities, 6 free municipal consortia, and 14 metropolitan cities, as well as the Aosta Valley region (which also exercises the powers of a province).

Italian provinces (with the exception of the current Sardinian provinces) correspond to the NUTS 3 regions.

==Overview==
A province of the Italian Republic is composed of many municipalities (). Usually several provinces together form a region; the region of Aosta Valley is the sole exception—it is not subdivided into provinces, and provincial functions are exercised by the region.

The three main functions devolved to provinces are:
* Local planning and zoning
* Provision of local police and fire services
* Transportation regulation (car registration, maintenance of local roads, etc.)

The number of provinces in Italy has been steadily growing in recent years, as many new ones are carved out of older ones. Usually, the province&#x27;s name is the same as that of its capital city.

According to the 2014 reform, each province is headed by a President (or Commissioner) assisted by a legislative body, the Provincial Council, and an executive body, the Provincial Executive. President (Commissioner) and members of Council are elected together by mayors and city councilors of each municipality of the province. The Executive is chaired by the President (Commissioner) who appoint others members, called . Since 2015, the President (Commissioner) and other members of the council will not receive a salary.

In each province, there is also a Prefect (), a representative of the central government who heads an agency called . The Questor () is the head of State Police () in the province and his office is called . There is also a provincial police force depending from local government, called provincial police ().

The Aosta Valley region is not divided into provinces due to its size, but straight to the level.

South Tyrol and Trentino are autonomous provinces, unlike all other provinces they have the same legislative powers as regions and are not subordinated to Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, the region they are part of.

==Type==
Based on the most recent legislation, contained in the law of 7 April 2014 n. 56, the council and the presidents of the provinces of the regions with ordinary statute are elected by restricted suffrage by the mayors and councilors of the province&#x27;s municipalities, while in the metropolitan cities, the equivalent of the president of the province is the (elective) mayor of the capital, called &quot;metropolitan mayor&quot;.

There are other types of entities similar to the provinces in the regions with special statutes: the free municipal consortia in Sicily and the Sardinian provinces are governed by extraordinary commissioners appointed by the respective regional administrations, the autonomous provinces of Trentino-Alto Adige each elect its own president, and finally, in Aosta Valley, the functions of the province are carried out by the regional administration (whose president is elected by the regional council).
==List of provinces==

===List===
Note: the data is updated as of 1 January 2021.
===Data===
* Sardinia — following the outcome of the regional referendums of 2012 it was decreed that such institutions should be reformed or abolished by March 2013 (thus remaining in office until 28 February 2013). In January 2014 the Sardinian Regional Administrative Court declared &quot;unconstitutional&quot; the abolition of the Sardinian provinces, which occurred in 2013. In 2016, Sardinian provinces were reformed by Sardinia regional executive: Cagliari became a metropolitan city; the provinces Olbia-Tempio, Ogliastra, Medio Campidano, and Carbonia-Iglesias were abolished. In 2017, Regional council of Sardinia approved the institution of a new province, South Sardinia. It was formed by the municipalities of province of Cagliari that did not join to metropolitan city of Cagliari, and those which formed the provinces of Medio Campidano and Carbonia Iglesias.
* Sicily — provinces were replaced by six free municipal consortia in 2013 and three metropolitan cities in 2015.
* Friuli-Venezia Giulia — in 2016, the regional council of Friuli-Venezia Giulia approved a law which abolished the four provinces that formed the region, and replaced them by 18 territorial unions of municipalities. In 2019, the regional council of Friuli-Venezia Giulia rebranded the four provinces as the four regional decentralization entities, with their own competences, powers, and capital.
* Metropolitan cities — in 2015, 14 metropolitan cities replaced the provinces of Bari, Bologna, Cagliari, Catania, Florence, Genoa, Messina, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Reggio Calabria, Rome, Turin, and Venice.

==History==

===National unification===

In 1861, at the birth of the Kingdom of Italy, there were 59 provinces. However, at that time the national territory was smaller than the current one: regions of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, and Lazio were not included in the kingdom.

In 1866, following the Third Independence War, territories of Veneto, Friuli and Mantua were annexed. There were therefore nine more provinces: Belluno, Mantua, Padua, Rovigo, Treviso, Venice, Verona, Vicenza, and Udine, all previously part of the Austrian Empire. Eventually, in 1870, following the union of Rome and its province from the Papal States, the provinces rose in number to 69.

After the World War I, new territories were annexed to Italy. The province of Trento was created in 1923. Provinces of La Spezia and Trieste in 1923, while Ionio in 1924. 
In 1924 the new provinces of Fiume, Pola, and Zara were created, increasing the total number of provinces in Italy to 76.

===Interwar period===

In 1927, after a royal charter, a general province rearrangement took place. 17 new provinces were created: Aosta, Vercelli, Varese, Savona, Bolzano, Gorizia, Pistoia, Pescara, Rieti, Terni, Viterbo, Frosinone, Brindisi, Matera, Ragusa, Castrogiovanni, Nuoro. In the same year, the province of Caserta was dissolved, Girgenti was renamed Agrigento, and the institution of , sub-provincial wards created before the unification, was abolished.

In 1930 Spezia became La Spezia, while in 1931 Bari delle Puglie became Bari. Province of Littoria (Latina) was created in 1934, and the province of Asti in 1935. In 1939 the province of Aquila degli Abruzzi became the province of L&#x27;Aquila, and in 1940 the province of Friuli was renamed the province of Udine.

Following the annexation of a part of Yugoslavia in 1941, during the World War II, the province of Zara was enlarged and joined the Governorate of Dalmatia (comprising the province of Zara, and the new provinces of Spalato, and Cattaro), while in the occupied central part of the present-day Slovenia the new province of Ljubljana was created. This lasted only until 1945, when Yugoslavia regained the lost territories after the end of the World War II.

===After World War II===
In 1945, after the end of the World War II, the province of Aosta changed its name to Aosta Valley and Littoria to Latina; the new province of Caserta was recreated.

With the Paris Peace Treaties, signed on 10 February 1947, Italy lost the provinces of Fiume, Pola, and Zara, and part of the provinces of Trieste and Gorizia. 

Moreover, the province of Trieste was occupied by United States and British forces. The Italian Republic therefore had 91 provinces at its birth. The province of Ionio was renamed as Taranto in 1951, and in 1954 the province of Trieste was returned to Italy.

===Recent history===
The province of Pordenone was created in 1968, the province of Isernia in 1970, and the province of Oristano in 1974. In a reorganization in 1992 eight provinces were created: Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Biella, Lecco, Lodi, Rimini, Prato, Crotone, and Vibo Valentia, while Forlì was renamed as Forlì-Cesena.

Four new provinces were created in Sardinia in 2001, with effect from 2005: Olbia-Tempio, Ogliastra, Medio Campidano, and Carbonia-Iglesias. In 2004 three further provinces were created: Monza and Brianza, Fermo, and Barletta-Andria-Trani, making a total of 110 provinces.
In May 2012, a referendum abolished the eight provinces of Sardinia, and this suppression was to take effect on 1 March 2013. On 6 July 2012, new plans were published to reduce the number of provinces by around half. In January 2014 the Sardinian Regional Administrative Court declared &quot;unconstitutional&quot; the abolition of the Sardinian provinces.

In 2014 the Delrio Law transformed the provinces of Italy in a reduced number of broader administrative entities.

In 2014 the Friuli-Venezia Giulia of Debora Serracchiani was the first Italian region to pass a law for abolishing its provinces, while implementing the national reform in the local administrative level. The Friuli region has multiplied four provinces in 18 unions of the Italian administrative unit called . After rejection of the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum, the provinces of Italy were still kept alive under provisions of the Delrio Constitutional Law to be merged in a smaller number of union of provinces.

==Former provinces==

* Provinces in islands of Greece: ; ; . Planned World War II provinces to be created of the Italian-annexed islands of Greece (Ionian Islands, Cyclades, and Samos).

==Controversies==

Provinces are often deemed useless by their critics, and many proposals were made in the 2010s to eliminate them. The difficulty of changing the Constitution of Italy and the opposition of groups of politicians and citizens halted any proposal of reform.

In 2013, during his speech to the Chamber of Deputies, Enrico Letta, the newly appointed Prime Minister of Italy, announced that a revision of the second part of the constitution was needed, in order to change the bicameral parliamentary system and to abolish the provinces. The proposal, presented during the Renzi government, was rejected in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum held on 4 December.

<text>The subjective theory of value (STV) is an economic theory for explaining how the value of goods and services are not only set but also how they can fluctuate over time. The contrasting system is typically known as the labor theory of value.

STV&#x27;s development helped to better understand human action and decision making in economics. The theory claims that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the cumulative value of components or labor needed to produce it, but instead is determined by the individuals or entities who are buying (and/or selling) that good.

Thus a good&#x27;s value may increase substantially following its creation if the good is perceived as being of greater importance, or as being more desirable than before. There are many variables that can influence this process, including, but not limited to, changes in the age of the good, personal affinity, cultural significance, scarcity, as well as situational circumstances. This is often seen in the case of collectable items such as cars, vinyl records, and comic books.

An additional variable, as Austrian economist Carl Menger pointed out, is the estimation of a good&#x27;s value due to uncertainty and lack of knowledge, in which people &quot;sometimes estimate the importance of various satisfactions in a manner contrary to their real importance&quot;.

It is one of several theories that sprang from the marginal revolution, which was a departure from classical economics, and in particular STV departed from the labor theory of value. The modern version of the subjective theory of value was created independently and nearly simultaneously by William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Carl Menger in the late 19th century. The theory has helped explain why the value of non-essential goods can be higher than essential ones, and how relatively expensive goods can have relatively low production costs.

==Overview==
According to the subjective theory of value, by assuming that all trades between individuals are voluntary, it can be concluded that both parties to the trade subjectively perceive the goods, labour or money they receive, as being of higher value to the goods, labour or money they give away. The theory holds that one can create value simply by trading with someone who values the items higher, without necessarily modifying them. Wealth is understood to refer to individuals&#x27; subjective valuation of their possessions, and voluntary trades may increase the total wealth in society. This is because each participant of the voluntary transaction has gained more value than they originally had.

This suggests that items cannot be objectively valued as any value placed upon the item is only correct if both buyer and seller agree on the price and a transaction takes place. A seller may value an item in their possession higher than any buyer will value it leading to either a price reduction until the item&#x27;s price equals a buyer&#x27;s value of the item, or the seller will continue to value the item higher than any buyer and no transaction will occur.

Individuals will experience more radical improvements to life and satisfaction from acquiring the first unit of a good compared to the marginal utility from acquiring additional units of a good. They will initially prioritise obtaining the goods they most need (of central, not marginal utility), such as essential food, but once their need for it is satisfied up to a certain level, their desire for other luxury or surplus goods will begin to rise, and the satisfaction obtained from the original essential goods will diminish.

Proponents of the theory also believe that in a free market, competition between individuals seeking to trade goods they possess and services they can provide for goods they perceive as being of higher value to them results in a market equilibrium set of prices emerging. This occurs during auctions. Bidders are able to express their belief in the value of each item via bids. As each person raises their bid, the value of the item rises even though the nature and function of the item has not changed. This behaviour can lead to the winner&#x27;s curse.

== Labour theory of value ==

Classical economists such as David Ricardo proposed a labour theory of value that states there is a direct correlation between the value of a good and the labour required to produce the good, concluding &quot;The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not on the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.&quot; Ricardo clarified that this correlation did not effectively connect those with market prices, or &#x27;value in exchange&#x27;, seeing them as separately derived from the quantity of labour input and other production factors. Increasing wages would not necessarily cause price rises, but conversely price rises may not cause wages to increase.

Carl Menger argued that production was simply another case of the theory of marginal utility, and that labourers&#x27; wage-earning potential is set by the value of their work to others rather than subsistence costs, and they work because they value remuneration more highly than inactivity.

A combination of both labour and subjective theories can be seen in the formulations of English economist Alfred Marshall. He argued that prices are determined by both the objective costs of production, the supply, and the subjective utility of consumers, the demand. This approach is in line with the modern conception of how market prices are determined, where both the demand and supply curves intersect. This is in contrast to other 19th century theories which view costs through a type of subjective value lens. Since the subjective value holds that buyers use their own value judgements, the same goes for sellers, and thus the mechanism of production. Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises believes that production costs are determined by a seller&#x27;s evaluations of their opportunity costs, or the sellers &quot;marginal utility lost of having fewer of that good&quot;. Under this, supply curves are also set by subjective preferences.

<doc id="316061" wikidata="Q610559" url="?curid=316061" title="Sluice">
<text>A sluice ( ) is a water channel containing a sluice gate, a type of lock to manage the water flow and water level. It can also be an open channel which processes material, such as a river sluice used in gold prospecting or fossicking. A mill race, leet, flume, penstock or lade is a sluice channeling water toward a water mill. The terms sluice, sluice gate, knife gate, and slide gate are used interchangeably in the water and wastewater control industry. 

==Operation==
&quot;Sluice gate&quot; refers to a movable gate allowing water to flow under it. When a sluice is lowered, water may spill over the top, in which case the gate operates as a weir. Usually, a mechanism drives the sluice up or down. This may be a simple, hand-operated, chain pulled/lowered, worm drive or rack-and-pinion drive, or it may be electrically or hydraulically powered. A flap sluice, however, operates automatically, without external intervention or inputs.

==Types of sluice gates==
; Flap sluice gate: A fully automatic type, controlled by the pressure head across it; operation is similar to that of a check valve. It is a gate hinged at the top. When pressure is from one side, the gate is kept closed; a pressure from the other side opens the sluice when a threshold pressure is surpassed.
; Vertical rising sluice gate: A plate sliding in the vertical direction, which may be controlled by machinery.
; Radial sluice gate: A structure, where a small part of a cylindrical surface serves as the gate, supported by radial constructions going through the cylinder&#x27;s radius. On occasion, a counterweight is provided.
; Rising sector sluice gate: Also a part of a cylindrical surface, which rests at the bottom of the channel and rises by rotating around its centre.
; Needle sluice: A sluice formed by a number of thin needles held against a solid frame through water pressure as in a needle dam.
; Fan gate: () This type of gate was invented by the Dutch hydraulic engineer in 1808. He was Inspector-General for &quot;Waterstaat&quot; (Water resource management) of the Kingdom of Holland at the time. The Fan door has the special property that it can open in the direction of high water solely using water pressure. This gate type was primarily used to purposely inundate certain regions, for instance in the case of the Hollandic Water Line. Nowadays this type of gate can still be found in a few places, for example in Gouda. A fan gate has a separate chamber that can be filled with water and is separated on the high-water-level side of the sluice by a large door. When a tube connecting the separate chamber with the high-water-level side of the sluice is opened, the water level, and with that the water pressure in this chamber, will rise to the same level as that on the high-water-level side. As there is no height difference across the larger gate, it exerts no force. However the smaller gate has a higher level on the upstream side, which exerts a force to close the gate. When the tube to the low water side is opened the water level in the chamber will fall. Due to the difference in the surface areas of the doors there will be a net force opening the gate.
== Designing the sluice gate ==
Sluice gates are one of the most common hydraulic structures used to control or measure the flow in open channels. Vertical rising sluice gates are the most common in open channels and can operate under two flow regimes: free flow and submerged flow. The most important depths in the designing of sluice gates are:
==Logging sluices==

In the mountains of the United States, sluices transported logs from steep hillsides to downslope sawmill ponds or yarding areas. Nineteenth-century logging was traditionally a winter activity for men who spent summers working on farms. Where there were freezing nights, water might be applied to logging sluices every night so a fresh coating of slippery ice would reduce friction of logs placed in the sluice the following morning.
==Placer mining applications==
Sluice boxes are often used in the recovery of black sands, gold, and other minerals from placer deposits during placer mining operations. They may be small-scale, as used in prospecting, or much larger, as in commercial operations, where the material is sometimes screened using a trommel, screening plant or sieve. Traditional sluices have transverse riffles over a carpet or rubber matting, which trap the heavy minerals, gemstones, and other valuable minerals. Since the early 2000s more miners and prospectors are relying on more modern and effective matting systems. The result is a concentrate which requires additional processing.

==Types of material==

;Aluminium: Most sluices are formed with aluminium using a press brake to form a U shape
; Wood: Traditionally wood was the material of choice for sluice gates.
; Cast iron: Cast iron has been popular when constructing sluice gates for years. This material is great at keeping the strength needed when dealing with powerful water levels. 
; Stainless steel: In most cases, stainless steel is lighter than the older cast iron material.
; Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP): In modern times, newer materials such as fibre-reinforced plastic are being used to build sluices. These modern technologies have many of the attributes of the older materials, while introducing advantages such as corrosion resistance and much lighter weights.

==Regional names for sluice gates==
In the Somerset Levels, sluice gates are known as clyse or clyce.

Most of the inhabitants of Guyana refer to sluices as kokers.

The Sinhala people in Sri Lanka, who had an ancient civilization based on harvested rain water, refer to sluices as Horovuwa.

<text>&quot;Kum ba yah&quot; (&quot;Come by here&quot;) is an African-American spiritual of disputed origin, known to have been sung in the Gullah culture of the islands off South Carolina and Georgia, with ties to enslaved Central Africans. Originally an appeal to God to come to the aid of those in need, the song is thought to have spread from the islands to other Southern states and the North, as well as to other places outside the United States.

The first known recording was made by the folklorist Robert Winslow Gordon in 1926. It features an unaccompanied tenor voice identified only as &quot;H. Wylie&quot; singing in the Gullah dialect. The piece became a standard campfire song in Scouting and summer camps and enjoyed broader popularity during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s. In American politics, the song title gave rise to the phrase &quot;&quot;, denoting unrealistic, excessively optimistic attempts at compromise.

==Origins==
According to the Library of Congress editor Stephen Winick, the song almost certainly originated among African Americans in the Southeastern United States. A Gullah version emerged early in its history, even if the song did not originate in that dialect. The two oldest versions whose year of origin is known for certain were both collected in 1926, and both reside in the Library&#x27;s American Folklife Center. No precise month or day was recorded for either version, so either may be the earliest known version of the song. One was submitted as a high-school collecting project by a student named Minnie Lee to her teacher, Julian P. Boyd, later a professor of history at Princeton University and president of the American Historical Association. This version, collected in Alliance, North Carolina, is a manuscript featuring lyrics but no music. The other 1926 version was recorded on a wax cylinder by Robert Winslow Gordon, founder of what began as the Library of Congress Archive of Folk Song, which became the American Folklife Center. The singer&#x27;s name was H. Wylie, and the song was recorded within a few hours&#x27; drive of Darien, Georgia, although Gordon did not note the exact location. Between 1926 and 1928, Gordon recorded three more versions of traditional spirituals with the refrain &quot;come by here&quot; or &quot;come by heah&quot;. One of these is a different song concerning the story of Daniel in the lions&#x27; den. Of the other two, one has been lost, and one cylinder was broken, so it cannot be determined if they are versions of &quot;Kumbaya&quot;.

According to an article in &quot;Kodaly Envoy&quot; by Lum Chee-Hoo, some time between 1922 and 1931, members of the Society for the Preservation of Spirituals collected a version from the South Carolina coast. &quot;Come by Yuh&quot;, as they called it, was sung in Gullah, the creole language spoken by the formerly enslaved Africans and their descendants living on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia, as well as the Bahamas. It is possible this is the earliest version, if it was collected before 1926. Because the individual songs in this society&#x27;s publications are not dated, however, it cannot be dated with certainty to before 1931.

In May 1936, John Lomax, Gordon&#x27;s successor as head of the Archive of Folk Song, discovered a woman named Ethel Best singing &quot;Come by Here&quot; with a group in Raiford, Florida.

These facts contradict the longstanding copyright and authorship attribution to the white Anglo-American songwriter Reverend Marvin V. Frey (1918–1992), who claimed to have written the song circa 1936 under the title &quot;Come By Here&quot;, inspired, he said, by a prayer he heard delivered by &quot;Mother Duffin&quot;, a storefront evangelist in Portland, Oregon. It first appeared in this version in &quot;Revival Choruses of Marvin V. Frey&quot;, a lyric sheet printed in that city in 1939. In an interview at the Library of Congress quoted by Winick, Frey said the change of the title to &quot;Kum Ba Yah&quot; came about in 1946, when a missionary family named Cunningham returned from Africa. where they had sung Frey&#x27;s version. According to Frey, they brought back a partly translated version, and &quot;Kum Ba Yah&quot; was an African phrase from Angola (specifically in Luvale). Frey said the Cunninghams then toured America singing the song with the text &quot;Kum Ba Yah&quot;.

The story of an African origin for the phrase circulated in several versions, spread also by the revival group the Folksmiths, whose liner notes for the song stated that &quot;Kum Ba Yah&quot; was brought to America from Angola. As Winick points out, however:

Although it is often said that the song originated in Gullah, Winick further points out that the Boyd manuscript, which may be the earliest version of the song, was probably not collected from a Gullah speaker.

A 45-rpm recording in a contemporary gospel style was released in 1958 by Little Sugar and the Hightower Brothers as &quot;Come by Here&quot;, on the Savoy label (backed with &quot;At the Golden Gate&quot;).

==Folk music revival and the civil rights movement==
The Folksmiths, including Joe Hickerson, recorded the song in 1957, as did Pete Seeger in 1958. Hickerson credits Tony Saletan, then a songleader at the Shaker Village Work Camp, for introducing him to &quot;Kumbaya&quot;. Saletan had learned it from Lynn Rohrbough, co-proprietor with his wife Katherine of the camp songbook publisher Cooperative Recreation Service, predecessor to World Around Songs. (Hickerson later succeeded Gordon and Lomax at the American Folklife Center, successor to the Archive of Folk Song.) Saletan himself never recorded the song, but he can be heard singing and discussing it in a 2017 podcast interview.
The song enjoyed newfound popularity during the American folk music revival of the early to mid-1960s, largely due to Joan Baez&#x27;s 1962 recording of the song, and became associated with the civil rights movement of that decade. For example, there is a recording of marchers singing the song as &quot;Come By Here&quot; during the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery (Alabama) march for voting rights.

== Political usage ==
The title of the song is often used sarcastically in English-speaking countries, either to make fun of spirituality and interpersonal relationships or to criticize their superficiality.

Beginning in the 1990s and increasing in the following decades, references to &quot;Kumbaya&quot; or &quot;singing &#x27;Kumbaya entered idiomatic usage in the politics of the United States, often to suggest that someone other than the speaker is too conciliatory or eager to compromise. Richard Vatz has characterized these references to the song as sarcastic criticism of consensus &quot;that allegedly does not examine the issues or is revelatory of cockeyed optimism.&quot;

For example, in discussing the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, U.S. President Barack Obama commented that the substantive disagreements between the parties &quot;can&#x27;t be reduced to somehow a matter of let&#x27;s all hold hands and sing &#x27;Kumbaya. Many other high-profile political figures have similarly referred derisively to the singing of the song as a way of expressing doubt or disparagement for potential compromise. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee explained his skepticism that ideologically aligned candidates in the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries would unite around a single individual by saying, &quot;there&#x27;s not going to be some magic moment at which three or four of these people sit around a campfire toasting marshmallows, singing &#x27;Kumbaya&#x27; and giving the nod to one of their competitors.&quot; Businessman and political candidate Herman Cain, speaking to a rally in 2011, said, &quot;Singing ‘Kumbaya’ is not a foreign policy strategy.&quot;

<doc id="316066" wikidata="Q332881" url="?curid=316066" title="Jonathan Aitken">
<text>Jonathan William Patrick Aitken (born 30 August 1942) is a British author, Church of England priest and former Conservative Party politician. Beginning his career in journalism, he was elected to Parliament in 1974 (serving until 1997), and was a member of the cabinet during John Major&#x27;s premiership from 1994 to 1995. That same year, he was accused by &quot;The Guardian&quot; of misdeeds conducted under his official government capacity. He sued the newspaper for libel in response, but the case collapsed, and he was subsequently found to have committed perjury during his trial. In 1999, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, of which he served seven months.

Following his imprisonment, Aitken became a Christian and later became the honorary president of Christian Solidarity Worldwide. He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 2019.

==Family==
Aitken&#x27;s parents were Sir William Traven Aitken, KBE, a former Conservative MP, and The Honourable Penelope, Lady Aitken, MBE, JP, daughter of The 1st Baron Rugby. Aitken is a great-nephew of the newspaper magnate and war-time minister, The 1st Baron Beaverbrook. His sister is the actress Maria Aitken and his nephew is the actor Jack Davenport. He is godfather to James Abbott, the son of Labour left-winger Diane Abbott, who had been his voting pair.

In 1979, Aitken married Serbian Lolica Olivera Azucki, a daughter of O. Azucki, living in Zürich, Switzerland; they divorced in 1998. With his first wife, he had twin daughters and one son, Alexandra and Victoria Aitken, and William Aitken respectively.

Aitken married his second wife, The Hon. Elizabeth Harris, daughter of The 1st Baron Ogmore, TD, PC, and former wife of actors Richard Harris and Sir Rex Harrison, in June 2003.

In 1999, DNA testing confirmed that Petrina Khashoggi, putative daughter of billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, was Aitken&#x27;s biological child, the result of an affair with Khashoggi&#x27;s wife Soraya (&quot;née&quot; Sandra Daly).
The paternity of Aitken himself has similarly been under question. In December 2008, Dutch historian Cees Fasseur said Aitken was the result of a wartime affair between Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and Penelope Aitken.

==Early life==
Aitken was born in Dublin, Ireland. His grandfather, Sir John Maffey (who was created The 1st Baron Rugby in February 1947), was the first official British representative to the newly independent Irish state, being appointed in October 1939, at a time when Anglo-Irish relations were strained but improving. Maffey&#x27;s official title was &quot;United Kingdom Representative to Éire&quot;. Aitken was baptised on 16 October 1942 at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, an Anglican church, and he was named &quot;Jonathan William Patrick Aitken&quot;. The third name, &quot;Patrick&quot;, was included at a late stage owing to the unexpected international importance of the occasion –- one of the Irish papers reported &quot;British envoy&#x27;s grandson is a real Paddy&quot;. The Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, who knew his grandparents, asked to attend the christening and his presence at the baptism was symbolic of improving Anglo-Irish relations. Also attending was Princess Juliana (later to become Queen Juliana of the Netherlands) as his godmother.

Aitken contracted tuberculosis, and at four years of age was admitted to Cappagh Hospital, Dublin, where he was an inpatient on a TB ward for more than three years, being cared for and educated by Catholic nuns. His father was severely injured as an RAF pilot when his Spitfire was shot down during the Second World War.

Aitken recovered and was discharged from the hospital aged seven. He lived with his parents at Halesworth, Suffolk, and learned to walk properly again within a few months.

Aitken was educated at Orwell Park School and then privately educated at Eton College, and then studied law at Christ Church, Oxford. His career initially followed a similar path to the post-war career of his father, who became a journalist and then the Conservative Member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds.

==Journalism and business==
He served as a war correspondent during the 1960s in Vietnam and Biafra, and gained a reputation for risk-taking when he took LSD in 1966 as an experiment for an article in the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and had a bad trip: &quot;this drug needs police, the Home Office and a dictator to stamp it out&quot;.

He was also a journalist at Yorkshire Television from 1968 to 1970, presenting the regional news show &quot;Calendar&quot;. Aitken was the first person to be seen on screen from Yorkshire Television when it began broadcasting.

In 1970, Aitken was acquitted at the Old Bailey of charges of breaching section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, when he photocopied a report about the British government&#x27;s supply of arms to Nigeria, and sent a copy to &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and to Hugh Fraser, a pro-Biafran (Nigerian Civil War) Tory MP. As a result of the case he was dropped as the Conservative candidate for the Thirsk and Malton parliamentary constituency.

Aitken was managing director of the Middle Eastern division of Slater Walker in 1973–75 and chairman of R. Sanbaar Consultants Ltd from 1976 to at least 1982, and a director of arms exporting firm BMARC from 1988 to 1990.

==Parliamentary career==
Aitken initially worked in parliament as private secretary to Conservative MP Selwyn Lloyd in 1964–66.

Defeated at Meriden in the West Midlands in 1966 and dropped as candidate for Thirsk and Malton (above), he was elected as MP for Thanet East in the February 1974 general election; from 1983 he sat for South Thanet. He managed to offend PM Margaret Thatcher by ending a relationship with her daughter, Carol Thatcher, and suggesting that Thatcher &quot;probably thinks Sinai is the plural of Sinus&quot; to an Egyptian newspaper. He stayed on the backbenches throughout Thatcher&#x27;s premiership, as well as participating in the re-launch of TV-AM, when broadcaster Anna Ford threw her wine at him to express her outrage at both his behaviour and the unwelcome consequent transformation of the TV station.

===Hollis affair===
Aitken wrote a highly confidential letter to Thatcher in early 1980, dealing with allegations that the former Director-General of MI5, Sir Roger Hollis, had been a double agent also working for the Soviet Union. This information had come to Aitken from retired CIA spymaster James Angleton. Espionage historian Chapman Pincher obtained a copy of the letter, and used former MI5 officers Peter Wright and Arthur Martin as his main additional secret sources, to write the sensational book &quot;Their Trade is Treachery&quot; in 1981. This matter continued to be highly controversial throughout the 1980s, and led to Wright eventually publishing his own book &quot;Spycatcher&quot; in 1987, despite the government&#x27;s prolonged Australian court attempts to stop him from doing so.

===Minister of State for Defence Procurement===
Aitken became Minister of State for Defence Procurement under prime minister John Major in 1992. He was later accused of violating ministerial rules by allowing an Arab businessman to pay for his stay in the Paris Ritz, perjured himself and was jailed (see below).

Aitken had previously been a director of BMARC, an arms exporter during 1988–1990. In 1995, a Commons motion showed that while a Cabinet minister he had signed a controversial Public Interest Immunity Certificate (PIIC) in September 1992 relating to the Matrix Churchill trial, and that the &quot;gagged&quot; documents included ones relating to the supply of arms to Iran by BMARC for a period when he was a director of the company.

===Chief Secretary to the Treasury===
He became Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 1994, a Cabinet position, but resigned in 1995 following the allegations that he had violated ministerial rules.

He was defeated in the 1997 general election. Within a year he had been appointed as a representative for the defence manufacturer GEC-Marconi (part of BAE Systems since November 1999).

==Libel, arrest and prison==
===Libel action===
On 10 April 1995, &quot;The Guardian&quot; carried a front-page report on Aitken&#x27;s dealings with leading Saudis. The story was the result of a long investigation carried out by journalists from the newspaper and from Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;World in Action&quot; programme. &quot;The Guardian&quot; also alleged Aitken, when Minister for Defence Procurement, procured prostitutes for Arab businessmen. Granada&#x27;s World in Action programme repeated the accusation in a television documentary called &quot;Jonathan of Arabia&quot;.

Aitken had called a press conference at the Conservative Party offices in Smith Square, London, at 5 p.m. that same day denouncing the claims and demanding that the &quot;World in Action&quot; documentary, which was due to be screened three hours later, withdraw them. He said:
The &quot;World in Action&quot; film &quot;Jonathan of Arabia&quot; was transmitted as planned and Aitken carried out his threat to sue. The action collapsed in June 1997 (a month after he had lost his seat in the 1997 general election) when &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Granada produced, via their counsel George Carman, evidence countering his claim that his wife, Lolicia Aitken, paid for the hotel stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. The evidence consisted of airline vouchers and other documents showing that his wife had, in fact, been in Switzerland at the time when she had allegedly been at the Ritz in Paris. The joint &quot;Guardian&quot;/Granada investigation indicated an arms deal scam involving Aitken&#x27;s friend and business partner, the Lebanese businessman Mohammed Said Ayas, a close associate of Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia. It was alleged that Aitken had been prepared to have his teenage daughter lie under oath to support his version of events, had the case continued.

A few days after the libel case collapsed, &quot;World in Action&quot; broadcast a special edition, which echoed Aitken&#x27;s &quot;sword of truth&quot; speech. It was titled &quot;The Dagger of Deceit&quot;.

During this time, it emerged that when Aitken was being encouraged to resign, he was chairman of the secretive right-wing think-tank Le Cercle, alleged by Alan Clark to be funded by the CIA.

===Perjury conviction and imprisonment===
Aitken was charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice and, after pleading guilty on 8 June 1999 to both offences, was sentenced to jail for 18 months of which he served almost seven months as a custodial sentence. While Aitken was sentenced, justice Scott Baker said Aitken had breached trust inexcusably. Baker told Aitken: &quot;For nearly four years you wove a web of deceit in which you entangled yourself and from which there was no way out unless you were prepared to come clean and tell the truth. Unfortunately you were not.&quot;

During the preceding libel trial, his wife Lolicia, who later left him, was called as a witness to sign a supportive affidavit to the effect that she had paid his Paris hotel bill, but did not appear. In the end, with the case already in court, investigative work by &quot;The Guardian&quot; reporters into Swiss hotel and British Airways records showed that neither his daughter nor his wife had been in Paris at the time in question.

===Bankruptcy===
Aitken was unable to cover the legal costs of his libel trial and was declared bankrupt. As part of the bankruptcy, his trustees settled legal actions against the magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, over the claims it had made that Aitken was a &quot;serial liar&quot;. He also became one of the few people to resign from the Privy Council. Aitken&#x27;s wife and three daughters turned up to support him when he was sentenced.

==Christian faith==
Aitken attended the Alpha Course in 1997, which he said stirred his interest in Christianity. He attended the course on further occasions prior to imprisonment. After being imprisoned in 1999, he began to study the Bible, learned Greek, and became a student of Christian theology at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford. This part of his life is covered in two autobiographical works called &quot;Pride and Perjury&quot; and &quot;Porridge and Passion&quot;.

Aitken&#x27;s claim that he had found God was met with some scepticism. Aitken said: &quot;In a different era, I&#x27;d have been one of the cynics myself. If I&#x27;d had a parliamentary colleague who’d got into trouble, gone to jail and come out saying, &#x27;I&#x27;ve found God&#x27;, I&#x27;d have said, &#x27;Oh, how very convenient for him&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; might insist that Aitken demonstrate the sincerity of repentance by repaying the whopping legal bill of one-and-half-million pounds he landed on them by his dishonest libel action. He was allowed to drop the case on promising to pay costs, but then escaped from the liability when he declared himself bankrupt and revealed that most of his apparent assets turn out to be conveniently owned by other people. &quot;The Guardian&quot; still believe he has more resources than he will admit.

In 2000 he said that he would not become a vicar because he considered himself not worthy of the office and &quot;wouldn&#x27;t like to give dog-collars a bad name&quot;.

In 2006 Aitken became honorary president of Christian Solidarity Worldwide.

===Ordained ministry===
On 30 June 2018, Aitken was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon by Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London. Since then he has served as a non-stipendiary minister at St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Westminster and as a chaplain of Pentonville Prison.

Exactly one year after becoming deacon, on 30 June 2019, Aitken was ordained as an Anglican priest in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Stoke Newington, also by the Bishop of London.

==Political comebacks==
In early 2004, some constituency party members in Aitken&#x27;s former seat of South Thanet proposed that he should return as Conservative candidate for the seat in the 2005 general election. This was vetoed by Conservative Party leader Michael Howard.

Aitken later confirmed that he would not attempt a return to Parliament, saying that &quot;the leader has spoken. I accept his judgement with good grace.&quot; He denied rumours he was to stand as an independent candidate insisting that he was not a &quot;spoiler&quot;.

Aitken later declared his support for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) a week before the party&#x27;s equally strong performance as the Liberal Democrats, with both parties winning 12 seats each in the 2004 European elections. On 2 October 2004, Aitken attended the (UKIP) conference and re-iterated his support for the party.

In November 2007, with the approval of senior members of the shadow cabinet, he took charge of a task force on prison reform within Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s Centre for Social Justice to help formulate Conservative Party policy. Aitken said this was not part of a political comeback. Conservative spokesmen pointed out that the task force is independent of the party, even though the organisation was run by Iain Duncan Smith. The report &quot;Locked Up Potential: A Strategy to Reform our Prisons and Rehabilitate our Prisoners&quot; was published in March 2009.

=== Parliamentary access ===
In September 2020, it was revealed that the former Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, awarded Aitken a parliamentary pass despite the House of Commons claiming that former MPs who had been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of one year or more were ineligible. In September 2020 Aitken had held a pass continuously since at least December 2015.

==Works==
===&quot;The Young Meteors&quot;===
In his early book &quot;The Young Meteors&quot; (London: Secker &amp; Warburg, 1967; New York: Atheneum, 1967), Aitken profiled the brightest lights among the younger generation in Britain, and particularly London, with a hint in the title that many of these were likely to burn and crash. Hunter Davies, one of the people profiled, has pointed out that such lists of the promising were then common in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, but unusual as books. Much later, Craig Taylor in 2003 observed that those profiled who were still burning brightly included Michael Caine, David Bailey, Twiggy, David Frost and Don McCullin. Taylor found it humdrum, but:

the book is worth re-examining these many years later for one reason. Aitken, it has been shown over time, is a figure we can always learn something from, a kind of walking, well-groomed Grimm&#x27;s fairy tale. . . . In [this book] he intuits the popularity and importance of unquantifiable lists of who is hot, young and going places.

Aitken himself in 2003 had a low opinion of the book: &quot;In terms of style, it was certainly the worst book I&#x27;ve ever written&quot;. Yet the title was memorable: it was consciously adopted by Martin Harrison for a survey of the British photojournalism (including Bailey and McCullin) of about the same period.

=== &quot;Nazarbayev and the Making of Kazakhstan: From Communism to Capitalism&quot; ===
In 2009 Aitken published a biography of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan, with the subject&#x27;s cooperation. &quot;The Diplomat&quot; observed that the publisher’s note &quot;describes Nazarbayev as a &#x27;widely admired&#x27; leader, which is an interesting descriptor for a political leader who has never won an election deemed free or fair.&quot; Aitken received a Kazakh award for his &quot;huge contribution to making Kazakhstan popular in the world and promoting its global reputation&quot;.

The book sold only 466 copies and was widely panned by critics, &quot;The Guardian&quot; noting that the book &quot;relies, for supporting evidence, on the good opinions of his [Nazarbayev&#x27;s] friends (or of those too cowed to utter a word out of place). It becomes curiously tolerant when oppression, corruption and galloping megalomania are on the menu.&quot; The review also described it as &quot;a fascinating, cleverly orchestrated snow job: quite probably the hagiography of the year.&quot; &quot;The London Review of Books&quot; wrote that the flattery within the biography ranged &quot;from the banal to the cringing.&quot; &quot;Eurasianet&quot; wrote that it was a &quot;hagiography&quot; that was part of Nazarbayev&#x27;s personality cult.

In 2021, documents leaked in the Pandora papers suggested that Aitken was paid £166,000 for writing the book by organisations with links to the Government of Kazakhstan, despite Aitken telling Reuters at the time of the publication &quot;that he had not received any payment from the government.&quot; One invoice from Aitken&#x27;s firm dated April 2009 for £33,333 is marked as &quot;agreed final instalment fee for book project&quot;.

===Other books===
Aitken has written several Christian religious books since his release from prison. He has published two books of prayers, &quot;Prayers for People under Pressure&quot; (2006),
and &quot;Psalms for People Under Pressure&quot; (2004), and wrote a biography of the English slaver, and later Anglican clergyman and abolitionist John Newton, &quot;John Newton: From Disgrace to Amazing Grace&quot;, in 2007.

Aitken has written several biographies of political figures, including the President of the United States Richard Nixon (&quot;Nixon: A Life&quot;, 1993). He also wrote on Nixon&#x27;s co-conspirator in the Watergate scandal, Charles Colson (&quot;Charles W. Colson: A Life Redeemed&quot;, 2005). Colson had assisted Aitken in his biography of Nixon, and had later corresponded with Aitken urging him to repent in the wake of the &quot;Guardian&quot; libel case. Aitken published a book of personal recollections of Margaret Thatcher, &quot;Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality&quot;, after her death in 2013.

<text>Tulagi, less commonly known as Tulaghi, is a small island in Solomon Islands, just off the south coast of Ngella Sule. The town of the same name on the island (pop. 1,750) was the capital of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate from 1896 to 1942 and is today the capital of the Central Province. The capital of what is now the state of Solomon Islands moved to Honiara, Guadalcanal, after World War II.

The island was originally chosen by the United Kingdom as a comparatively isolated and healthier alternative to the disease-ridden larger islands of the Solomon Islands archipelago.

In October 2019, the government of Central Province signed a deal to grant the 75-year lease of the entire island of Tulagi to a Chinese company China Sam Enterprise Group. However, this was declared unconstitutional by the Solomon Islands parliament after a week and, consequently, the deal was cancelled.

== Climate ==

==History==
The first recorded sighting by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of Álvaro de Mendaña on 16 April 1568. More precisely the sighting was due to a local voyage done by a small boat, in the accounts the brigantine &quot;Santiago&quot;, commanded by &quot;Maestre de Campo&quot; Pedro Ortega Valencia and having Hernán Gallego as pilot.

===World War II===
The Japanese occupied Tulagi on May 3, 1942, with the intention of establishing a seaplane base nearby (see Japanese Tulagi landing). The ships in Tulagi harbor were raided by planes from the following day in a prelude to the Battle of the Coral Sea.

Allied forces, primarily the 1st Marine Raiders, landed on August 7 and captured Tulagi as part of Operation Watchtower after a day of hard fighting.

After its capture by United States Navy and Marine Corps forces, the island hosted a squadron of PT boats for a year, which included LTJG John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;PT-109&quot; as well as other ancillary facilities. A small 20-bed dispensary was operated on Tulagi until its closure in 1946. The island also formed part of Purvis Bay, which hosted many US Navy ships during 1942 and 1943.

===Postwar===
The present-day Tulagi has a fishing fleet.

==Scuba diving==
Tulagi offers numerous scuba diving locations. The wrecks of USS &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;, USS &quot;Kanawha&quot;, and HMNZS &quot;Moa&quot; are close by, and the wrecks of Ironbottom Sound are not much further off, to the south and west. These three ships were all sunk in the same Japanese naval air raid, part of the Operation &quot;I&quot; on April 7, 1943. The &quot;Ward&quot; lies upright and intact, its deck replete with artifacts, on a sandy bottom at .

Tulagi is developing a tourism industry based on scuba.

<text>Rómulo Ernesto Betancourt Bello (22 February 1908 – 28 September 1981; ), known as &quot;The Father of Venezuelan Democracy&quot;, was a Venezuelan politician who served as the president of Venezuela, from 1945 to 1948 and again from 1959 to 1964, as well as leader of the Democratic Action, Venezuela&#x27;s dominant political party in the 20th century.

Betancourt, one of Venezuela&#x27;s most important political figures, led a tumultuous career in Latin American politics. Periods of exile brought Betancourt in contact with various Latin American countries as well as the United States, securing his legacy as one of the most prominent international leaders to emerge from 20th-century Latin America. Scholars credit Betancourt as the Founding Father of modern democratic Venezuela.

==Early years==

Betancourt was born in Guatire, a town near Caracas. His parents were Luis Betancourt Bello (of Canary origins) and Virginia Bello Milano. He attended a private school in Guatire, followed by high school at the &quot;Liceo Caracas&quot; in Caracas. He studied law at the Central University of Venezuela.

As a young man he was expelled from Venezuela for agitation and moved to Costa Rica where he founded, and led, a number of Communist student groups. In the early 1930s, while in Costa Rica, he became one of the main militants of that country&#x27;s Communist Party at the young age of 22. In 1937, after resigning from the Communist Party and returning to Venezuela, he founded the Partido Democrático Nacional, which became an official political party in 1941 as Acción Democrática (AD).

Colombian leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán claimed Betancourt had &quot;offered him arms and money to launch a revolution in Colombia&quot; which was part of Betancourt&#x27;s alleged plan to build a solid phalanx of left-wing regimes in the Caribbean. 

==First term as president==

Betancourt became president in 1945 by means of a military coup d&#x27;état and, during his time in office, completed an impressive agenda. His accomplishments included the declaration of universal suffrage, the institution of social reforms, and securing half of the profits generated by foreign oil companies for Venezuela. His government worked closely with the International Refugee Organization to aid European refugees and displaced persons who could not or would not return home after World War II; his government assumed responsibility for the legal protection and resettlement of tens of thousands of refugees inside Venezuela. The refugee initiative was the subject of great controversies within his government with the winning side led by Betancourt&#x27;s secretary of Agriculture, Eduardo Mendoza.

===Reform of the oil industry===
In 1941, before AD&#x27;s entry into policymaking, Venezuela received 85,279,158 bolívars from oil taxes, out
of a total oil value of 691,093,935 bolivars. Before Betancourt&#x27;s changes in the taxing system, the state of Venezuela was making only a fraction of what foreign oil companies were making in profit. President Betancourt had overthrown the Isaías Medina Angarita government which enacted a law to tax oil companies up to 60%, and reserved for the government the right to raise more taxes as needed. Betancourt changed the law to &quot;Fifty to Fifty&quot;. 

One of Betancourt&#x27;s original objectives was the nationalization of the country&#x27;s oil industry. Mexico had nationalized its oil industry in 1938, and because its economy was more diversified than Venezuela&#x27;s, there was little to no backlash. Though oil nationalization became one of AD&#x27;s main objectives, Venezuela&#x27;s economy was not stable enough to handle potential boycotts by foreign oil companies and would have left nation fiscally vulnerable.

Rationalizing the complications of nationalization at the time, Betancourt&#x27;s government raised taxes on oil production instead accomplishing the same goal: Venezuela&#x27;s oil riches to benefit Venezuelans. In the late 1940s Venezuela was producing close to annually and as production climbed, the tax followed. Venezuela was the Allies&#x27; top oil supplier during the wars occurring in the European continent. Betancourt identified this potential to play an important historical role, using the knowledge to his nation&#x27;s advantage transforming Venezuela into a global player. Germany then lacked reliable access to oil limiting troop movements. Some historians identify this vulnerability a deciding factor in Hitler&#x27;s defeat. Venezuelan oil played a key role.

According to Betancourt, a spike in taxes was just as effective as nationalizing the oil industry, &quot;Tax income was increased from then to such a degree that nationalization was unnecessary to obtain maximum economic benefits for the people of the country&quot;. Oil companies were forced to cede to the demands of labor unions and no longer entitled to make larger profits than the Venezuelan government. As a result, Betancourt&#x27;s government generally had full support of the labor unions as the administration openly encouraged workers to organize. In 1946, 500 labor unions were created. Another notable achievement of Betancourt&#x27;s first administration include the termination of the concession policy, the initial development of refineries within Venezuela, and tremendous improvement in worker conditions and pay. Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso served as Minister of Development in Betancourt&#x27;s first term.

=== Government Junta cabinet (1945–1948) ===
==Third exile==

Betancourt presided over the country&#x27;s first free elections, in 1947, which were won by the AD&#x27;s Rómulo Gallegos. However, on 27 November 1948, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Luis Felipe Llovera Páez launched the 1948 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état and overthrew Gallegos after just ten months in office. Betancourt went into exile in New York City. In exile he planned a political return sustained on democratic principles and open elections legitimizing his national leadership role. His forward vision and strategy was successful and Betancourt was elected president by his own people upon returning to Venezuela. He had been determined to expose to the world the political problems and dictatorships that plagued the country through most of its modern history – a risky proposition.

&quot;Betancourt&#x27;s third, and longest, period of exile was a time of enormous frustration. In the prime of his life --for roughly the decade of his forties-- he was forced into relative inactivity and obscurity. He traveled extensively, living in Cuba, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico, and remained a leader of an opposition-in-exile to the Perez Jimenez dictatorship. And of course wrote &#x27;Venezuela: Oil and Politics&#x27;. A beach home outside of San Juan (Puerto Rico) provided a quiet refuge for this work,&quot; wrote Franklin Tugwell in his Introduction to the 1978 English publication of Betancourt&#x27;s book.

&quot;The preparation of this book has been as hectic as the life of the author. I wrote it first between the years 1937–39 while I was underground hiding from the police. It could not be published then because no Venezuelan publisher would dare risk printing a book written by one who was in such compromising position. The only typewritten copy was among my personal papers and it disappeared with them when a military patrol plundered the house I was living in when the constitutional government was overthrown on 24 November 1948. Thus most of the material from the first draft was lost.

&quot;I believe that &#x27;the dead command,&#x27; although not in the sense that reactionaries have traditionally given the phrase. When they die they give the command for an ideal of human excellence, obliging those who survive to finish their work,&quot; wrote Rómulo Betancourt in the Prologue to the first edition of &quot;Venezuela: Oil and Politics&quot;.

The book published in Mexico City by Editorial Fondo de Cultura Económica in 1956 was prohibited from circulating in Venezuela.

==Second term as president==

A decade later, after Pérez Jiménez was ousted, Betancourt was elected president in the general election of 1958, becoming the first leader of the Punto Fijo Pact. Having inherited a well constructed country but with the need to give more education to its people, Betancourt nevertheless managed to return the state to fiscal solvency despite the rock-bottom petroleum prices throughout his presidency.

In 1960 two important institutions were created by Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso, Betancourt&#x27;s minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons: the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation (Corporación Venezolana del Petróleo — CVP), conceived to oversee the national petroleum industry, and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the international oil cartel that Venezuela established in partnership with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran. Considered a radical revolutionary idea at the time by its opponents, but essential to Venezuela&#x27;s independence and fiscal solvency by a visionary nationalistic Betancourt.

At an annual oil convention in Cairo, Venezuela&#x27;s envoy, fluent in Arabic, convinced oil producing Middle Eastern countries to sign a secret agreement that promoted unity and control of their own national oil resources; under the noses of the British and American corporations that dominated the oil industry globally and had funded the event. Planting the seed for OPEC that was founded in September 1960 at Baghdad, Iraq. This movement was triggered by a 1960 law instituted by American President Dwight Eisenhower that forced quotas for Venezuelan oil and favored Canada and Mexico&#x27;s oil industries. Eisenhower cited national security, land access to energy supplies, at times of war. Betancourt reacted seeking an alliance with oil producers of Middle Orient and North Africa as a pre-emptive strategy to protect the continuous autonomy and profitability of Venezuela&#x27;s oil, establishing a strong link between the South American nation and the OPEC countries that survives to this day.

On a scenario of suspended economic guarantees, special situation derived from the Castro-communist armed insurrection, Betancourt adopted the CEPAL model of substitution of imports in order to achieve a fast track to development through industrialization that succeeds in replacing imported goods with locally produced goods. The government strategy include tax exceptions to attract capital investment and terrains at low cost to facilitate foreign suppliers to build plants for the assembly or packaging of finished products, closing the economy to trade through excessive tax to similar imported goods, import quotas to reduce foreign competition or other quantitative restrictions that prohibited imports. In addition, the Central Bank overestimated the Bolivar to cut down prices of imported inputs and promote export-oriented growth. Large road-building, and electrical power programs as the construction of Guri Dam Phase I were carried out, transforming Venezuela into a modernized Latin American nation.

===Agrarian reform===

AD&#x27;s land reform distributed unproductive private properties and public lands to halt the decline in agricultural production. Landowners who had their properties confiscated received compensation.

===FALN guerrilla group===

Betancourt also faced determined opposition from extremists and rebellious army units, yet he continued to push for economic and educational reform. A fraction split from the AD and formed the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). When leftists were involved in unsuccessful revolts at Barcelona (&quot;El Barcelonazo&quot;) in 1961 and in navy bases in 1962 (&quot;El Carupanazo&quot;, Carúpano, and &quot;El Porteñazo&quot;, Puerto Cabello), Betancourt suspended civil liberties. Elements of the left parties then formed the Armed Forces for National Liberation (FALN), a communist guerrilla army to fight him. This drove the leftists underground, where they engaged in rural and urban guerrilla activities, including sabotaging oil pipelines, bombing a Sears Roebuck warehouse, Alfredo Di Stefano kidnapping, and bombing the United States Embassy in Caracas. FALN failed to rally the rural poor and to disrupt the December 1963 elections.

After numerous attacks, he finally arrested the MIR and Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) members of Congress. It became clear that a leftist Fidel Castro had been arming the rebels, so Venezuela protested to the Organization of American States (OAS).

===Assassination attempt===
Betancourt had denounced the dictatorship of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s Rafael Trujillo. In turn, Trujillo had developed an obsessive personal hatred of Betancourt and supported many plots by Venezuelan exiles to overthrow him. The Venezuelan government took its case against Trujillo to the Organization of American States, turning to diplomacy first over armed response to resolve the political conflict. That, in turn, infuriated Trujillo, who ordered his foreign agents to assassinate Betancourt in Caracas. The 24 June 1960 attempt, in which the Venezuelan president was badly burned, inflamed world public opinion against Trujillo, who was himself assassinated within a year.

Photos of a wounded but living Betancourt were distributed around the world as proof he survived the assassination attempt that killed his head of security and severely injured the driver, who later died. An incendiary car bomb, which was in a parked vehicle, was detonated as his presidential car drove by one of the main avenues of Caracas, which shocked the nation. With both burned hands wrapped in bandages, Betancourt walked out of the hospital in front of photographers. The incident elevated him in the eyes of the public opinion.

=== Constitutional government cabinet (1959–1964) ===




===1963 elections===

Perhaps one of the greatest of Betancourt&#x27;s accomplishments was success in the 1963 elections. Despite threats to disrupt the process, nearly 90 percent of the electorate participated on 1 December in what was the most honest election in Venezuela to that date. 11 March 1964 was a day of pride for the people of Venezuela as for the first time the presidential sash passed from one democratically elected chief executive to another. Prior to Betancourt changing the law, all presidents in Venezuela were elected by Congress – in typical republic model.

He was Venezuela&#x27;s first democratically elected president to serve his full term, and was succeeded by Raúl Leoni. It was Romulo Betancourt who established a democratic precedent for the nation that had been ruled by dictatorships for most of its history. It was &#x27;revolution&#x27; by popular vote, without historical reference until then; Betancourt created the political model that had survived in Venezuela for many years afterward.

===Betancourt Doctrine===

The Venezuelan president&#x27;s antipathy for nondemocratic rule was reflected in the so-called Betancourt Doctrine, which denied Venezuelan diplomatic recognition to any regime, right or left, that came to power by military force. Betancourt always defended, and represented, democratic values and principles in Latin America. This put him at odds with the military strongmen who came to dominate and define political perception of the region.
During his first message to Congress as President of Venezuela, on 12 February 1959, Betancourt said:

&quot;... Regimes disrespectful of human rights, violating their citizens´ freedom, tyrannizing them with the backing of totalitarian political police, should be submitted to a rigorous sanitary cordon and eradicated, through collective pacification, from the Inter-American juridical community&quot;
It was during the tense Cuban Missile Crisis, between the United States and Cuba, the relationship between President Kennedy and President Betancourt became closer than ever. Establishing a direct phone link between the White House and Miraflores (Presidential Palace) since the Venezuelan president had ample experience on dealing, defeating and surviving, actions of Caribbean regimes.

These conversations between both presidents were translated by Betancourt&#x27;s only child, Virginia Betancourt Valverde, who served as interpreter and confidant to her father.

Later president Rafael Caldera distanced himself from the doctrine, which he thought had
served to isolate Venezuela in the world. A thesis that continues to be debated among academics and intellectuals who see in Betancourt not an isolationist but a courageous defender of democratic principles in the midst of adversity and ferreous enemies.

==Later life==

In 1964, Betancourt was awarded a lifetime seat in Venezuela&#x27;s senate, due to status as a former president. His last days were dedicated to writing and to his wife Dr. Renee Hartmann. He died on 28 September 1981 in Doctors Hospital in New York City. On his death US President Ronald Reagan made the following statement:

==Personal life==
Betancourt was married Carmen Valverde, who became First Lady of Venezuela from 1945 to 1948, and 1959–1964. Virginia Betancourt Valverde was the Betancourt&#x27;s only child. They divorced and he married Dr. Renee Hartmann.
Rómulo Betancourt was a very close friend of the governor of Puerto Rico, Luis Muñoz Marín, visiting the island often and frequently exchanging political views with him, viewing him as a political advisor on democracy. Although they disagreed on certain issues they remained faithful friends. On one occasion in 1963, he refused to attend the inauguration of Juan Bosch as president of the Dominican Republic if Bosch did not extend an invitation to Muñoz Marín, who had provided a safe haven for Bosch and various members of his political party in Puerto Rico. Betancourt attended the funeral of his friend in 1980.

<text>John Fante (April 8, 1909 – May 8, 1983) was an American novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter. He is best known for his semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; (1939) about the life of Arturo Bandini, a struggling writer in Depression-era Los Angeles. It is widely considered the great Los Angeles novel, and is one in a series of four, published between 1938 and 1985, that are now collectively called &quot;The Bandini Quartet.&quot; &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; was adapted into a 2006 film starring Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek. Fante&#x27;s published works while he lived included five novels, one novella, and a short story collection. Additional works, including two novels, two novellas, and two short story collections, were published posthumously. His screenwriting credits include, most notably, &quot;Full of Life&quot; (1956, based on his 1952 novel by that name), &quot;Jeanne Eagels&quot; (1957), and the 1962 films &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; and &quot;The Reluctant Saint&quot;.

==Early life==
Fante was born in Denver, Colorado, on April 8, 1909, to Nicola Fante from Torricella Peligna (Abruzzo), and Mary Capolungo, a devout Catholic of Lucanian descent who was born in Chicago, Illinois. Nicola Fante was a bricklayer and stonemason, who drank and gambled to excess, leaving the Fante family to experience bouts of poverty. Fante attended various Catholic schools including Regis High School, before briefly enrolling at the University of Colorado. He dropped out of college in 1929 and “hitchhiked to Los Angeles at age 24” to focus on his writing.

Fante and Joyce Smart met on January 30, 1937, and were married on July 31 of that same year in Reno, Nevada.

==Career==
After many unsuccessful attempts at publishing stories in the highly regarded literary magazine &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, his short story &quot;Altar Boy&quot; was accepted conditionally by the magazine&#x27;s editor, H. L. Mencken. With Mencken&#x27;s help, in 1938 Fante published his first novel, &quot;Wait Until Spring, Bandini&quot;. The following year, his best known novel, the semi-autobiographical &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;, appeared. “Much of the book focuses on Main Street and Pershing Square” in downtown Los Angeles, natural habitat of the “poor Los Angeles poet” who was the novel’s protagonist.

Bandini served as his alter ego in a total of four novels, often known as &quot;The Bandini Quartet&quot;: &quot;Wait Until Spring, Bandini&quot; (1938), &quot;The Road to Los Angeles&quot; (chronologically second in the saga, this is the first novel Fante wrote, but it was unpublished until 1985), &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; (1939) and finally &quot;Dreams from Bunker Hill&quot; (1982), which was dictated to his wife, Joyce, “from his hospital bed.”

His short story collection, &quot;Dago Red&quot;, was originally published in 1940, and then republished with a few additional stories in 1985 under the title &quot;The Wine of Youth&quot;.

Starting in the 1950s, Fante made a living primarily as a screenwriter, building a lucrative career writing mostly unproduced screenplays. According to a local historian, “He wrote movie scripts with drinking partner William Faulkner in the 1940s, and was still active in the studios in the 1950s and 1960s.”

Fante&#x27;s screenwriting credits include the comedy-drama &quot;Full of Life&quot; (1957), based on his 1952 novel of the same name, which starred Judy Holliday and Richard Conte, and was nominated for Best Written American Comedy at the 1957 WGA Awards. He also co-wrote &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; (1962), which stars Jane Fonda in her second credited film role, based on the novel by Nelson Algren. His other screenplay credits include &quot;Dinky&quot;, &quot;Jeanne Eagels&quot;, &quot;My Man and I&quot;, &quot;The Reluctant Saint&quot;, &quot;Something for a Lonely Man&quot;, and &quot;Six Loves&quot;. As Fante himself often admitted, most of what he wrote for the screen was simply hackwork intended to bring in a paycheck.

In the late 1970s, at the suggestion of novelist and poet Charles Bukowski, who had accidentally discovered Fante&#x27;s work in the Los Angeles Public Library, Black Sparrow Press began to republish the (then out-of-print) works of Fante, creating a resurgence in his popularity.

==Later life and death==
Fante was diagnosed with diabetes in 1955, which ultimately cost him his eyesight and led to the 1977 amputation of his toes and feet, and later legs. He died on May 8, 1983.

Fante and Joyce raised four children in Malibu, California, including Dan Fante, an author and playwright who died in 2015.

==Legacy and recognition==

He is one of the first to portray the tough times of writers in Los Angeles and has been referred to as &quot;the quintessential L.A. novelist.&quot; He has also been cited as a precursor to Beat writers. Robert Towne has called &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; the greatest novel ever written about Los Angeles. Michael Tolkin said the novel should be &quot;mandatory reading&quot; in the Los Angeles school system. More than 60 years after it was published, &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; appeared for several weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; Best Sellers List.

Fante&#x27;s work and style have influenced Charles Bukowski, who stated in his introduction to &quot;Ask the Dust&quot; that &quot;Fante was my god&quot;. Bukowski dedicated poems to Fante, and in the early part of his career was said to go around shouting, &quot;I am Arturo Bandini!&quot; in reference to Fante&#x27;s alter ego. In his 1978 novel &quot;Women&quot;, Bukowski&#x27;s alter ego Henry Chinaski is asked to name his favorite author; he replies, &quot;Fante.&quot;

Fante wrote about writing, about people he knew, and about places where he lived and worked, which included Wilmington, Long Beach, Manhattan Beach, the Bunker Hill district of downtown Los Angeles Hollywood, Echo Park and Malibu. Recurring themes in Fante&#x27;s work are poverty, Catholicism, family life, Italian-American identity, sports, and racism. Kristopher Cook proposes a concentration on themes of &quot;existentialism; philosophy – finding the meaning of life through free will, choice, and personal concern&quot;. Neil Gordon suggests Fante&#x27;s works exude a &quot;profound urge to realize an artistic talent and an equally profound anxiety about recognition in the literary market&quot;. Fante&#x27;s clear voice, vivid characters, shoot-from-the-hip style, and painful, emotional honesty blended with humor and scrupulous self-criticism give his books wide appreciation. Most of his novels and stories take place in Colorado or California. Some of his novels and short stories feature or focus on fictional incarnations of Fante&#x27;s father, Nicola Fante, as a cantankerous, wine tippling, cigar stub-smoking bricklayer.

In 1987, Fante was posthumously awarded the PEN USA President&#x27;s Award.

On October 13, 2009, Los Angeles City Council member Jan Perry put forward a motion, seconded by Jose Huizar, that the intersection of Fifth Street and Grand Avenue be designated John Fante Square. The site is outside the Los Angeles Central Library frequented by the young Fante, and where Charles Bukowski discovered &quot;Ask The Dust.&quot; On April 8, 2010, the author&#x27;s 101st birthday, the Fante Square sign was unveiled in a noon ceremony attended by Fante&#x27;s family, fans and city officials. Fante Square is located near the old Bunker Hill neighborhood he wrote about, and where he also lived.

==Film and theater adaptations==

Francis Ford Coppola bought the rights to &quot;The Brotherhood of the Grape&quot;, but a film was not produced. Dominique Deruddere directed the movie version of &quot;Wait Until Spring, Bandini&quot;, which was released in 1989. In March 2006, Paramount Pictures released &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;, directed by Robert Towne and starring Colin Farrell, Salma Hayek and Donald Sutherland. In December 2006, a 2001 documentary film about Fante, &quot;A Sad Flower in the Sand&quot; (directed by Jan Louter), aired on the PBS series &quot;Independent Lens&quot;. Yvan Attal directed and starred in the French film &quot;My Dog Stupid&quot; (&quot;Mon chien Stupide&quot;), released in October 2019, based on the story of the same name in &quot;West of Rome&quot;.

On January 18, 2001, the play &quot;1933&quot; by Randal Myler and Brockman Seawell, based on Fante&#x27;s novel &quot;1933 Was a Bad Year&quot;, premiered at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts.

<doc id="316073" wikidata="Q1198531" url="?curid=316073" title="Going Dutch">
<text>&quot;Going Dutch&quot; (sometimes written with lower-case dutch) is a term that indicates that each person participating in a paid activity covers their own expenses, rather than any one person in the group defraying the cost for the entire group. The term stems from restaurant dining etiquette in the Western world, where each person pays for their meal. It is also called Dutch date, Dutch treat (the oldest form, a pejorative), and doing Dutch.

A derivative is &quot;sharing Dutch&quot;, having a joint ownership of luxury goods. For example: four people share the ownership of a plane, boat, car, or any other sharable high-end product. This in order to minimize cost, sharing the same passion for that particular product and to have the maximum usage of this product.

==Etymology==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; connects &quot;go Dutch&quot; / &quot;Dutch treat&quot; to other phrases which have &quot;an opprobrious or derisive application, largely due to the rivalry and enmity between the English and Dutch in the 17th century&quot;, the period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Another example is &quot;Dutch courage&quot;. A term bearing some similarities is Dutch oven.

== Practices ==
=== Africa ===
In Egypt, it is called &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;English-style&#x27;, and traditionally is considered rude.

=== Americas ===
In the United States of America, the practice of &quot;going Dutch&quot; is often related to specific situations or events. During meals such as birthdays, first dates or company business lunches, an expectation develops based on social traditions, personal income, and the strength of relationship between the parties. Moreover, the increase in prevalence for mobile sharing payment platforms such as Venmo or Zelle has resulted in a cultural rethinking of meal payments.

==== Latin America ====

Some Latin American countries use the Spanish phrase &quot;&quot; (literally &#x27;to pay American-style&#x27;) which refers to a trait attributed to people from the United States or Canada.

In Chile and Uruguay, the phrase used is &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to make/build/create a cow&#x27;) which means that each participant pays into a common pool to either pay the bill afterwards, or beforehand, when buying for a meeting or party at a home. In this case, a person is designated as the &quot;bank&quot; (the one who collects the money). This system is used either when planning the things to buy for a party, or when paying the bill in a restaurant or pub. It still is splitting the bill, but one person pays for all of it and is reimbursed by the others. In more formal settings (office party) the participants may require to see the supermarket bill to check that the money was spent as agreed.

In Panama, the phrase &#x27; [or &#x27;] &#x27; (using colloquial contractions of &#x27;, with the stress on the first syllable &quot;mi&quot;); this is literally &#x27;half and half&#x27;, and refers to both &quot;going Dutch&quot; and to splitting the check equally.

In Guatemala, a sing-song phrase is used: &quot;&#x27;&quot;, literally &#x27;By the law of Christ, each one with his own stew&#x27;. &#x27; is a stewed dish similar to ratatouille, and is used in this phrase as a stand-in for food in general.

It is almost the same in Honduras, where the phrase is &quot;&quot;, &#x27;As Christ said, everyone with their own stew.&#x27; However, the word &quot;pisto&quot; is commonly used to denote money, rather than the stew itself.

In El Salvador, a different rhyming phrase is used: &quot;&quot;, which means &#x27;Spartan law: each pays [for] what they eat&#x27;.

A Costa Rican system is known as &#x27;, literally &#x27;to go with Cuyo&#x27; (Cuyo being supposedly a person; this is a stand-in name, like &quot;John Doe&quot; in English). If one of the diners asks &quot;&#x27; (&#x27;Who is Cuyo?&#x27;) another may respond that he or she is (i.e that this person will pay the bill), or may suggest &quot;cada uno con lo suyo&quot;, &#x27;each with his own&#x27;, meaning each person should pay for what they ate.

In Brazil, the slang word “rachar” is used for the same purpose, or when it’s too expensive, the group shares the total so everyone pays the same.

In Mexico, the phrase &quot;&quot;, literally &#x27;A white-tie Event&#x27; is used in the context where all participants are expected to contribute, either monetarily or in kind--derived from the homonyms &#x27;traje,&#x27; first person preterit conjugation of the verb &#x27;traer&#x27; (&#x27;I brought&#x27;), and the generic term for formal male attire, &#x27;traje&#x27; (&#x27;suit&#x27;).

===Asia===

==== East Asia ====
In Japan, it is called &quot;warikan&quot; (), which translates into &#x27;splitting the cost&#x27;.

In North Korea, where rigid social systems are still in place, it is most common for the person of the highest social standing, such as a boss or an elder figure, to pay the bill. This not only applies in a 1 to 1 situation but also in groups. Among the younger generation, it is quite common for friends to alternate when paying the bill, or for one to pay for dinner and another to pay for drinks.

In South Korea, &quot;going Dutch&quot; is called &quot;Dutch pay&quot; (), a Konglish loan phrase. For romantic dates, men usually pay.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, after a group meal, it is expected that the bill be paid by the person who has highest social standing or highest income, or by the person who made the invitation. A group of friends or colleagues who dine together regularly will often take turns paying the bill. Men often pay for the initial romantic dates, however after several dates, it is not uncommon for women to take a turn at paying for dates. It is not uncommon among groups of strangers or sometimes younger generations to split the bill; payment platforms and super-apps WeChat Pay and Alipay have a built-in bill-sharing feature.

==== South Asia ====
In India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan was not the prevailing method due to complex societal pressures. It has become somewhat common amongst the younger generation.

In Afghanistan, they call it &quot;Bandar&quot; which means group food but contribution from all participants. The word &quot;going Dutch&quot; is common amongst the younger generation, especially students. The same practice is considered negative in family meetings. Afghan people consider themselves as the best in hospitality. They take loans for their guests and disallow guests to pay for themselves.

In Pakistan, going Dutch is sometimes referred to as the &quot;American system&quot;. This practice is more prevalent among the younger age group, friends, colleagues and some family members to request separate bills. In Urdu, the practice is called &quot;apna apna&quot;, which means &#x27;each his own&#x27;. In a group, going Dutch generally means splitting the bill equally.

In Bangladesh it is common to use the term &quot;je je, jar jar&quot; () &#x27;his his, whose whose&#x27;.

In Nepal, people would say “aafno aafno” literally means ‘yours, yours’ that equivalents to pay for your own. However, sometimes youngsters use their own made up English phrases such as “going together, paying separate”. 

===== India =====
&quot;Going Dutch&quot; is not a common practice in most of India. Being a country known for hospitality, it is common for someone to pay the whole bill, sometimes even if it is large group. Recently however, the practice of going Dutch has become more common amongst colleagues and couples. 

In India there are many names for the practice, in different languages: it is called TTMM for &quot;tu tera mein mera&quot; in Hindi; &quot;je jaar shey taar&quot; in Bengali; &quot;tujhe tu majhe mi&quot; in Marathi; &quot;neenu nindu koodu, nanu nandu kodthini&quot; in Kannada; EDVD for &quot;evadi dabbulu vaadi dabbule&quot; in Telugu; and &quot;thantrathu, thaan&quot; in Malayalam. These all generally translate to &#x27;you pay yours and I pay mine&#x27;, though in practice it refers to splitting the bill equally. Since the concept of freely dating is comparatively new in India – a culture with a long history of arranged marriage – going Dutch is primarily not applied to dating but to outings among friends and colleagues. When the expression going Dutch is used, it often refers to splitting the bill equally.

==== Southeast Asia ====
In Indonesia, the term is BSS and BMM, as acronym for &quot;bayar sendiri-sendiri&quot; and &quot;bayar masing-masing&quot;, which both mean &#x27;pay for yourself&#x27;. This term is most commonly used in less formal settings, such as among friends. In a more formal setting the commonly accepted convention is person with higher social standing to take the payments. Among equal members of group it is considered polite to offer payments for all the meals and drinks in which the other party have the opportunity to refuse or accept out of respect for the other party.

In the Philippines, it is referred to as KKB, an acronym for &quot;&quot; which means &#x27;pay for your own self&#x27;. KKB would generally be the norm among friends or people of similar financial standing. As in most Asian countries, the person footing the bill is generally dictated by gender roles or their standing in the community or work. It is still general practice to have the male answer the bill especially during courtship or when in romantic relationships.

In Thailand, the practice is referred to as , &#x27;American share&#x27;.

==== West Asia====
In most West Asian cultures, asking to &quot;go Dutch&quot; is seen as rude. Traditions of hospitality play a great part in determining who pays, therefore an invitation will be given only when the host feels that he or she is able to afford the expenses of all. Similarly, gender roles and age play a more important role than they would in Western societies.

In Iraq, the expression is &quot;&quot; (), referring to the people of Mosul who are supposedly stingy.

In the Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, and Jordan, the expression is &#x27; (), referring to the people of Damascus in Syria, who are supposedly stingy. A similar expression is &#x27; (meaning &#x27;sharing the Aleppo way&#x27;), bearing a similar connotation.

In Turkey The corresponding phrase in Turkish is &#x27;, which can be translated into English as &#x27;to pay the bill the German way&#x27;; in short form, it is &#x27;, &#x27;German-style&#x27;.

In Iran, it is called &quot;Dongi&quot; (), which translates into &#x27;sharing equally&#x27; and is used usually among close friends and the young when they are not invited by a specific host. Otherwise, the host will not allow anybody to pay, according to Persian hospitality norms. The practice has become quite common in Iran.

=== Europe ===
In Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Malta, it is rather uncommon for most locals to have separate bills, and is sometimes even regarded as rude, especially when in larger groups. In urban areas or places frequented by tourists, this has changed over the last decades.

In the Nordic countries and the Netherlands, going Dutch is the norm for almost every visit to a restaurant, with larger groups being the exception, especially on more formal occasions. Though the Scandinavian countries are some of the most gender-equal in the world, it is still common and mostly expected for men (in a heterosexual context) to pay for lunch/dinner on romantic dates. One exception to this norm is in the case of a woman asking a man out, where it would be considered polite for the woman to pay the bill. If a date is over fika (in Sweden), the parties usually go Dutch, because of the usually smaller price tag.

In Italy there is specific phrase to describe sharing a bill in equal parts that is &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to pay as the Romans [do]&#x27;, &#x27;to pay Roman-style&#x27;) but there is not an equivalent to &quot;going dutch&quot; since it is very uncommon.
In Greece, the practice is colloquially called &quot;&quot;.

In Catalonia &quot;going Dutch&quot; is the rule among Catalans.

In France, &#x27; (colloquially &#x27;), literally &#x27;make half-[and]-half&#x27;, which means each one pays an equal portion of the bill. For romantic dates, the traditional practice is that the man pays. In a business meeting, the hosting party usually pays for all – it is considered rude not to do so.

In Portugal is called &quot;contas à moda do Porto&quot; meaning Oporto&#x27;s style bills or &quot;a meias&quot; meaning half-half/splitting the cost.

<doc id="316076" wikidata="Q422956" url="?curid=316076" title="Propionic acid">
<text>Propionic acid (, from the Greek words πρῶτος : &quot;prōtos&quot;, meaning &quot;first&quot;, and πίων : &quot;píōn&quot;, meaning &quot;fat&quot;; also known as propanoic acid) is a naturally occurring carboxylic acid with chemical formula . It is a liquid with a pungent and unpleasant smell somewhat resembling body odor. The anion as well as the salts and esters of propionic acid are known as propionates or propanoates.

About half of the world production of propionic acid is consumed as a preservative for both animal feed and food for human consumption. It is also useful as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals, especially polymers.

==History==
Propionic acid was first described in 1844 by Johann Gottlieb, who found it among the degradation products of sugar. Over the next few years, other chemists produced propionic acid by different means, none of them realizing they were producing the same substance. In 1847, French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas established all the acids to be the same compound, which he called propionic acid, from the Greek words πρῶτος (prōtos), meaning &quot;first&quot;, and πίων (piōn), meaning &quot;fat&quot;, because it is the smallest acid that exhibits the properties of the other fatty acids, such as producing an oily layer when salted out of water and having a soapy potassium salt.

==Properties==
Propionic acid has physical properties intermediate between those of the smaller carboxylic acids, formic and acetic acids, and the larger fatty acids. It is miscible with water, but can be removed from water by adding salt. As with acetic and formic acids, it consists of hydrogen bonded pairs of molecules in both the liquid and the vapor.

Propionic acid displays the general properties of carboxylic acids: it can form amide, ester, anhydride, and chloride derivatives. It undergoes the Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky reaction that involves α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid with bromine, catalysed by phosphorus tribromide, in this case to form 2-bromopropanoic acid, . This product has been used to prepare a racemic mixture of alanine by ammonolysis.

==Manufacture==
===Chemical===
In industry, propionic acid is mainly produced by the hydrocarboxylation of ethylene using nickel carbonyl as the catalyst:

It is also produced by the aerobic oxidation of propionaldehyde. In the presence of cobalt or manganese salts (manganese propionate is most commonly used), this reaction proceeds rapidly at temperatures as mild as 40–50 °C:

Large amounts of propionic acid were once produced as a byproduct of acetic acid manufacture. At the current time, the world&#x27;s largest producer of propionic acid is BASF, with approximately 150 kt/a production capacity.

===Biotechnological ===
Biotechnological production of propionic acid mainly uses &quot;Propionibacterium&quot; strains. However, large scale production of propionic acid by &quot;Propionibacteria&quot; faces challenges such as severe inhibition of end-products during cell growth and the formation of by-products (acetic acid and succinic acid). One approach to improve productivity and yield during fermentation is through the use of cell immobilization techniques, which also promotes easy recovery, reuse of the cell biomass and enhances microorganisms&#x27; stress tolerance. In 2018, 3D printing technology was used for the first time to create a matrix for cell immobilization in fermentation. Propionic acid production by &quot;Propionibacterium acidipropionici&quot; immobilized on 3D-printed nylon beads was chosen as a model study. It was shown that those 3D-printed beads were able to promote high density cell attachment and propionic acid production, which could be adapted to other fermentation bioprocesses. Other cell immobilization matrices have been tested, such as recycled-glass Poraver and fibrous-bed bioreactor.

Alternative methods of production have been trialled, by genetically engineering strains of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; to incorporate the necessary pathway, the Wood-Werkman cycle.

==Industrial uses==
Propionic acid inhibits the growth of mold and some bacteria at levels between 0.1 and 1% by weight. As a result, some propionic acid produced is consumed as a preservative for both animal feed and food for human consumption. For animal feed, it is used either directly or as its ammonium salt. This application accounts for about half of the world production of propionic acid. The antibiotic monensin is added to cattle feed to favor propionibacteria over acetic acid producers in the rumen; this produces less carbon dioxide and feed conversion is better. Another major application is as a preservative in baked goods, which use the sodium and calcium salts. As a food additive, it is approved for use in the EU, US, Australia and New Zealand.

Propionic acid is also useful as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals, especially polymers. Cellulose-acetate-propionate is a useful thermoplastic. Vinyl propionate is also used. In more specialized applications, it is also used to make pesticides and pharmaceuticals. The esters of propionic acid have fruit-like odors and are sometimes used as solvents or artificial flavorings.

In biogas plants, propionic acid is a common intermediate product, which is formed by fermentation with propionic acid bacteria. Its degradation in anaerobic environments (e.g. biogas plants) requires the activity of complex microbial communities.

In production of the Jarlsberg cheese, a propionic acid bacteria is used to give both taste and holes.

==Biology==
Propionic acid is produced biologically as its coenzyme A ester, propionyl-CoA, from the metabolic breakdown of fatty acids containing odd numbers of carbon atoms, and also from the breakdown of some amino acids. Bacteria of the genus &quot;Propionibacterium&quot; produce propionic acid as the end-product of their anaerobic metabolism. This class of bacteria is commonly found in the stomachs of ruminants and the sweat glands of humans, and their activity is partially responsible for the odor of Emmental cheese, American &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; and sweat.

The metabolism of propionic acid begins with its conversion to propionyl coenzyme A, the usual first step in the metabolism of carboxylic acids. Since propionic acid has three carbons, propionyl-CoA cannot directly enter either beta oxidation or the citric acid cycles. In most vertebrates, propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to -methylmalonyl-CoA, which is isomerised to -methylmalonyl-CoA. A vitamin B12-dependent enzyme catalyzes rearrangement of -methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle and can be readily incorporated there.

Propionic acid serves as a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis via conversion to succinyl-CoA. Additionally, exogenous propionic acid administration results in more endogenous glucose production than can be accounted for by gluconeogenic conversion alone. Exogenous propionic acid may upregulate endogenous glucose production via increases in norepinephrine and glucagon, suggesting that chronic ingestion of propionic acid may have adverse metabolic consequences.

In propionic acidemia, a rare inherited genetic disorder, propionate acts as a metabolic toxin in liver cells by accumulating in mitochondria as propionyl-CoA and its derivative, methylcitrate, two tricarboxylic acid cycle inhibitors. Propanoate is metabolized oxidatively by glia, which suggests astrocytic vulnerability in propionic acidemia when intramitochondrial propionyl-CoA may accumulate. Propionic acidemia may alter both neuronal and glial gene expression by affecting histone acetylation. When propionic acid is infused directly into rodents&#x27; brains, it produces reversible behavior (e.g., hyperactivity, dystonia, social impairment, perseveration) and brain changes (e.g., innate neuroinflammation, glutathione depletion) that may be used as a means to model autism in rats.

===Human occurrence===
The human skin is host of several species of &quot;Propionibacteria&quot;. The most notable one is the &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Propionibacterium acnes&quot;), which lives mainly in the sebaceous glands of the skin and is one of the principal causes of acne. Propionate is observed to be among the most common short-chain fatty acids produced in the large intestine of humans by gut microbiota in response to indigestible carbohydrates (dietary fiber) in the diet. The role of the gut microbiota and their metabolites, including propionate, in mediating brain function has been reviewed.

A study in mice suggests that propionate is produced by the bacteria of the genus &quot;Bacteroides&quot; in the gut, and that it offers some protection against &quot;Salmonella&quot; there. Another study finds that fatty acid propionate can calm the immune cells that drive up blood pressure, thereby protecting the body from damaging effects of high blood pressure.

=== Bacteriology ===
The Bacteria species &quot;Coprothermobacter platensis&quot; produces propionate when fermenting gelatin. &quot;Prevotella brevis&quot; and &quot;Prevotella ruminicola&quot; also generate propionate when fermenting glucose. 

== Propionate salts and esters ==
The propionate , or propanoate, ion is , the conjugate base of propionic acid. It is the form found in biological systems at physiological pH. A propionic, or propanoic, compound is a carboxylate salt or ester of propionic acid. In these compounds, propionate is often written in shorthand, as or simply .

Propionates should not be confused with propenoates (commonly known as acrylates), the ions/salts/esters of propenoic acid (also known as 2-propenoic acid or acrylic acid).

<doc id="316081" wikidata="Q5986733" url="?curid=316081" title="Icosian calculus">
<text>The icosian calculus is a non-commutative algebraic structure discovered by the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1856.
In modern terms, he gave a group presentation of the icosahedral rotation group by generators and relations.

Hamilton&#x27;s discovery derived from his attempts to find an algebra of &quot;triplets&quot; or 3-tuples that he believed would reflect the three Cartesian axes. The symbols of the icosian calculus correspond to moves between vertices on a dodecahedron. (Hamilton originally thought in terms of moves between the faces of an icosahedron, which is equivalent by duality. This is the origin of the name &quot;icosian&quot;.) Hamilton&#x27;s work in this area resulted indirectly in the terms Hamiltonian circuit and Hamiltonian path in graph theory. He also invented the icosian game as a means of illustrating and popularising his discovery.

== Informal definition ==
The algebra is based on three symbols, formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3, that Hamilton described as &quot;roots of unity&quot;, by which he meant that repeated application of any of them a particular number of times yields the identity, which he denoted by 1. Specifically, they satisfy the relations,

:formula_4

Hamilton gives one additional relation between the symbols,

:formula_5

which is to be understood as application of formula_2 followed by application of formula_1. Hamilton points out that application in the reverse order produces a different result, implying that composition or multiplication of symbols is not generally commutative, although it is associative. The symbols generate a group of order 60, isomorphic to the group of rotations of a regular icosahedron or dodecahedron, and therefore to the alternating group of degree five. This, however, is not how Hamilton described them.

Hamilton drew comparisons between the icosians and his system of quaternions, but noted that, unlike quaternions, which can be added and multiplied, obeying a distributive law, the icosians could only, as far as he knew, be multiplied.

Hamilton understood his symbols by reference to the dodecahedron, which he represented in flattened form as a graph in the plane. The dodecahedron has 30 edges, and if arrows are placed on edges, there are two possible arrow directions for each edge, resulting in 60 directed edges. Each symbol corresponds to a permutation of the set of directed edges. The definitions below refer to the labeled diagram above. The notation formula_8 represents a directed edge from vertex formula_9 to vertex formula_10. Vertex formula_9 is the &quot;tail&quot; of formula_8 and vertex formula_10 is its &quot;head&quot;.

*The icosian symbol formula_1 reverses the arrow on every directed edge, that is, it interchanges the head and tail. Hence formula_15 is transformed into formula_16. Similarly, applying formula_1 to formula_16 produces formula_15, and to formula_20 produces formula_21.
*The icosian symbol formula_2, applied to a directed edge formula_23, produces the directed edge that (1) has the same head as formula_23 and that (2) is encountered first as one moves around the head of formula_23 in the anticlockwise direction. Hence applying formula_2 to formula_15 produces formula_28, to formula_16 produces formula_30, and to formula_20 produces formula_32.
*The icosian symbol formula_3 applied to a directed edge formula_23 produces the directed edge that results from making a right turn at the head of formula_23. Hence applying formula_3 to formula_15 produces formula_38, to formula_16 produces formula_40, and to formula_20 produces formula_42. Comparing the results of applying formula_2 and formula_3 to the same directed edge exhibits the rule formula_45.

It is useful to define the symbol formula_46 for the operation that produces the directed edge that results from making a left turn at the head of the directed edge to which the operation is applied. This symbol satisfies the relations

:formula_47

For example, the directed edge obtained by making a left turn from formula_15 is formula_49. Indeed, formula_2 applied to formula_15 produces formula_28 and formula_3 applied to formula_28 produces formula_49. Also, formula_56 applied to formula_15 produces formula_58 and formula_1 applied to formula_58 produces formula_49.

These permutations are not rotations of the dodecahedron. Nevertheless, the group of permutations generated by these symbols is isomorphic to the rotation group of the dodecahedron, a fact that can be deduced from a specific feature of symmetric cubic graphs, of which the dodecahedron graph is an example. The rotation group of the dodecahedron has the property that for a given directed edge there is a unique rotation that sends that directed edge to any other specified directed edge. Hence by choosing a reference edge, say formula_15, a one-to-one correspondence between directed edges and rotations is established: let formula_63 be the rotation that sends the reference edge formula_64 to directed edge formula_65. (Indeed, there are 60 directed edges and 60 rotations.) The rotations are permutations of the set of directed edges of a different sort. Let formula_66 denote the image of edge formula_65 under the rotation formula_68. The icosian associated to formula_68 sends the reference edge formula_64 to the same directed edge as does formula_68, namely to formula_72. The result of applying that icosian to any other directed edge formula_65 is formula_74.

== Application to Hamiltonian circuits on the edges of the dodecahedron ==
A word consisting of the symbols formula_3 and formula_46 corresponds to a sequence of right and left turns in the graph. Specifying such a word along with an initial directed edge therefore specifies a directed path along the edges of the dodecahedron. If the group element represented by the word equals the identity, then the path returns to the initial directed edge in the final step. If the additional requirement is imposed that every vertex of the graph be visited exactly once—specifically that every vertex occur exactly once as the head of a directed edge in the path—then a Hamiltonian circuit is obtained. Finding such a circuit was one of the challenges posed by Hamilton&#x27;s icosian game. Hamilton exhibited the word formula_77 with the properties described above. Any of the 60 directed edges may serve as initial edge as a consequence of the symmetry of the dodecahedron, but only 30 distinct Hamiltonian circuits are obtained in this way, up to shift in starting point, because the word consists of the same sequence of 10 left and right turns repeated twice. The word with the roles of formula_3 and formula_46 interchanged has the same properties, but these give the same Hamiltonian cycles, up to shift in initial edge and reversal of direction. Hence Hamilton&#x27;s word accounts for all Hamiltonian cycles in the dodecahedron, whose number is known to be 30.

== Legacy ==
The icosian calculus is one of the earliest examples of many mathematical ideas, including:
* presenting and studying a group by generators and relations;
* visualization of a group by a graph, which led to combinatorial group theory and later geometric group theory;
* Hamiltonian circuits and Hamiltonian paths in graph theory;
* dessin d&#x27;enfant – see dessin d&#x27;enfant: history for details.

<text>The Chrysophyceae, usually called chrysophytes, chrysomonads, golden-brown algae or golden algae, are a large group of algae, found mostly in freshwater. Golden algae is also commonly used to refer to a single species, &quot;Prymnesium parvum&quot;, which causes fish kills.

The Chrysophyceae should not be confused with the Chrysophyta, which is a more ambiguous taxon. Although &quot;chrysophytes&quot; is the anglicization of &quot;Chrysophyta&quot;, it generally refers to the Chrysophyceae.

==Members==
Originally they were taken to include all such forms of the diatoms and multicellular brown algae, but since then they have been divided into several different groups (e.g., Haptophyceae, Synurophyceae) based on pigmentation and cell structure. Some heterotrophic flagellates as the bicosoecids and choanoflagellates were sometimes seen as related to golden algae too.

They are now usually restricted to a core group of closely related forms, distinguished primarily by the structure of the flagella in motile cells, also treated as an order Chromulinales. It is possible membership will be revised further as more species are studied in detail. 
The Chrysophyceae have been placed by some in the polyphyletic Chromista. The broader monophyletic group to which the Chrysophyceae belong includes various non-algae including the bicosoecids, not the collar flagellates, opalines, oomycete fungi, proteromonads, actinophryid heliozoa, and other heterotrophic flagellates and is referred to as the Stramenopiles.

==Description==

The &quot;primary&quot; cell of chrysophytes contains two specialized flagella. The active, &quot;feathered&quot; (with mastigonemes) flagellum is oriented toward the moving direction. The smooth passive flagellum, oriented toward the opposite direction, may be present only in rudimentary form in some species.

An important characteristic used to identify members of the class Chrysophyceae is the presence of a siliceous cyst that is formed endogenously. Called statospore, stomatocyst or statocyst, this structure is usually globose and contains a single pore. The surface of mature cysts may be ornamented with different structural elements and are useful to distinguish species.

* Most members are unicellular flagellates, with either two visible flagella, as in &quot;Ochromonas&quot;, or sometimes one, as in &quot;Chromulina&quot;. The Chromulinales as first defined by Pascher in 1910 included only the latter type, with the former treated as the order Ochromonadales. However, structural studies have revealed that a short second flagellum, or at least a second basal body, is always present, so this is no longer considered a valid distinction. Most of these have no cell covering. Some have loricae or shells, such as &quot;Dinobryon&quot;, which grows in branched colonies. Most forms with silicaceous scales are now considered a separate group, the synurids, but a few belong among the Chromulinales proper, such as &quot;Paraphysomonas&quot;.
* Some members are generally amoeboid, with long branching cell extensions, though they pass through flagellate stages as well. &quot;Chrysamoeba&quot; and &quot;Rhizochrysis&quot; are typical of these. There is also one species, &quot;Myxochrysis paradoxa&quot;, which has a complex life cycle involving a multinucleate plasmodial stage, similar to those found in slime molds. These were originally treated as the order Chrysamoebales. The superficially similar &quot;Rhizochromulina&quot; was once included here, but is now given its own order based on differences in the structure of the flagellate stage.
* Other members are non-motile. Cells may be naked and embedded in mucilage, such as &quot;Chrysosaccus&quot;, or coccoid and surrounded by a cell wall, as in &quot;Chrysosphaera&quot;. A few are filamentous or even parenchymatous in organization, such as &quot;Phaeoplaca&quot;. These were included in various older orders, most of the members of which are now included in separate groups. &quot;Hydrurus&quot; and its allies, freshwater genera which form branched gelatinous filaments, are often placed in the separate order Hydrurales, but may belong here.

==Ecology==
Chrysophytes live mostly in freshwater, and are important for studies of food web dynamics in oligotrophic freshwater ecosystems, and for assessment of environmental degradation resulting from eutrophication and acid rain.

==Evolution==

Chrysophytes contain the pigment fucoxanthin. Because of this, they were once considered to be a specialized form of cyanobacteria. Because many of these organisms had a silica capsule, they have a relatively complete fossil record, allowing modern biologists to confirm that they are, in fact, not derived from cyanobacteria, but rather an ancestor that did not possess the capability to photosynthesize. Many of the chrysophyta precursor fossils entirely lacked any type of photosynthesis-capable pigment. The most primitive stramenopiles are regarded as heterotrophic, such as the ancestors of the Chrysophyceae were likely heterotrophic flagellates that obtained their ability to photosynthesize from an endosymbiotic relationship with fucoxanthin-containing cyanobacteria.

<doc id="316084" wikidata="Q1931127" url="?curid=316084" title="Come On Pilgrim">
<text>Come On Pilgrim is the debut mini-album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released on September 28, 1987, on 4AD. Produced by Gary Smith, the release consists of eight tracks from a seventeen-song recording session that the band had recorded at Fort Apache Studios in March 1987.

Signing the band based on the quality of the recordings, 4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell whittled its track-listing down to eight songs, remixing them to become &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;. The remaining nine songs were subsequently released in 2002 as &quot;Pixies&quot;.

== Background ==
In March 1987, Pixies entered Boston&#x27;s Fort Apache Studios with Fort Apache owner/record producer Gary Smith to record a demo tape. The resulting 17-song cassette, later dubbed &quot;The Purple Tape&quot;, eventually found its way to Ivo Watts-Russell, president and co-founder of the influential British record label 4AD. Pixies&#x27; manager Ken Goes was also the manager of Throwing Muses, who had become the first American band to sign to 4AD a year earlier. Goes passed Pixies&#x27; demo tape on to Watts-Russell, who walked the streets of New York listening to it on his Walkman and &quot;absolutely adored it from day one&quot;. Despite initial hesitance to sign the band, seeing as how 4AD had already signed an American band from the same manager, he was convinced to do so by his girlfriend, Deborah Edgeley, a secretary for 4AD.

According to frontman Black Francis, the Purple Tape was recorded &quot;with the intention of releasing it as a record.&quot; However, Watts-Russell felt that &quot;there was too much that was just not that good&quot; and insisted on choosing only eight of the 17 songs for release. &quot;I felt that those eight songs were a bang in the face, left you wanting more, and I thought that the recorded versions of the other songs that were on the Purple Tape were not that great.&quot; Original session producer Gary Smith differed, thinking the songs &quot;should all be served up at once because that&#x27;s how you would get a sense of how colossally important this band was.&quot; Watts-Russell intentionally chose not to include &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot;, feeling it was &quot;too obviously commercial&quot;.

Expressing regret that some other previous 4AD debuts had failed to live up to the power of their demo versions, Watts-Russell decided to slightly remix the eight Purple Tape songs for release, rather than have the band re-record the songs. Pixies re-recorded eight of the nine remaining Purple Tape tracks for later albums and EP releases, the sole exception being &quot;Rock a My Soul&quot;. This, along with the rest of the nine &quot;missing&quot; Purple Tape tracks, were released as &quot;Pixies&quot; in 2002.

==Artwork and packaging==
The title of the album is derived from &quot;Watch What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;, a song by Christian rock singer Larry Norman, that includes the line, &quot;C&#x27;mon pilgrim, you know he loves you&quot;, which the Pixies quote in the song &quot;Levitate Me&quot;. Of Norman, Francis said, &quot;when I was 14 I really dug him. I dressed like him, I looked like him, he was my total idol.&quot;

The artwork was conceived by Vaughan Oliver, with photography from Simon Larbalestier. The man in the &quot;hair shirt&quot; on the cover was a friend of Larbalestier&#x27;s and the photograph was from a series of work Larbalestier was making based on &quot;The Temptation of Saint Anthony&quot; by Gustave Flaubert.

== Composition ==
=== Music ===
&quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; showcased much of Pixies&#x27; variety and set up the beginnings of many trends in their music. It displayed Joey Santiago&#x27;s innovative guitar leads, Kim Deal&#x27;s sunny vocal harmonies, and Black Francis&#x27;s vocal range, which varied from screaming to traditionally-sung melodies. A version of the song &quot;Vamos&quot; would appear on Pixies&#x27; next two releases: re-recorded with Steve Albini for their first full-length album, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;, and as a live B-side on their first single, &quot;Gigantic&quot;.

Reflecting on &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; in 2022, Black Francis noted: &quot;I was listening to &quot;Murmur&quot; by R.E.M. a lot just before &quot;Come on Pilgrim&quot; and that was hugely influential on me as a songwriter. I’m going to be cocky and say: we were even better than &quot;Murmur&quot;.&quot;

=== Lyrics ===
&quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; includes two songs partly sung in Spanish (&quot;Vamos&quot; and &quot;Isla de Encanta&quot;), which drew upon some of Francis&#x27;s experiences in Puerto Rico. (Isla de Encanta is an alteration of the island&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Isla del Encanto&quot;, meaning &quot;isle of enchantment&quot;.) Two songs explicitly mention incest: &quot;Nimrod&#x27;s Son&quot; and &quot;The Holiday Song&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Tired&quot; refers metaphorically to sex and rock &amp; roll culture, and there are four songs with overt religious references or language (&quot;Caribou&quot;, &quot;Nimrod&#x27;s Son&quot;, &quot;The Holiday Song&quot; and &quot;Levitate Me&quot;). &quot;Caribou&quot; is about reincarnation. &quot;Ed Is Dead&quot; is about a brain-damaged girl known to Francis who rode a bicycle with a transistor radio strapped to its handlebars, so she could play music.

== Release ==
The original 1987 UK release of &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; entered the UK indie album chart on , spending 29 weeks on the chart and peaking at number 5. The album received far more attention from the music press in the UK than in the United States, and was reviewed in &quot;Q Magazine&quot;, &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;.

The album failed to secure distribution in the United States when it was first released and was first issued in the U.S. in August 1988, when Rough Trade included it on their CD release of the band&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot;. At the same time, the two releases were issued on separate vinyl records by Rough Trade. That same month, 4AD also released &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; and &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; on CD together in the UK. This has been the standard UK CD release ever since, only being out of print for about six months in 1998. Subsequent U.S. CD releases have split them in two.

In 1992, Elektra Records issued &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; on separate CDs in the U.S. After 4AD re-acquired the band&#x27;s US distribution rights in 2004, they were again released on CD separately; this version of &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot; was the first CD release to carry the 4AD catalogue number (MAD 709).

<text>Carlisle Sessions Floyd (June 11, 1926September 30, 2021) was an American composer primarily known for his operas. These stage works, for which he wrote not only the music but also the librettos, typically engage with themes from the American South, particularly the Post-civil war South, the Great Depression and rural life. His best known opera, &quot;Susannah&quot;, is based on a story from the Biblical Apocrypha, transferred to contemporary rural Tennessee, and written for a Southern dialect. It was premiered at Florida State University in 1955, with Phyllis Curtin in the title role. When it was staged at the New York City Opera the following year, the reception was initially mixed; some considered it a masterpiece, while others degraded it as a &#x27;folk opera&#x27;. Subsequent performances led to an increase in &quot;Susannah&quot;&#x27;s reputation and the opera quickly became among the most performed of American operas.

In 1976, he became M. D. Anderson professor at the University of Houston. He co-founded the Houston Opera Studio for the training of young singers. Floyd is regarded as the &quot;Father of American opera&quot;.
== Life and career==
===Youth and education===
Floyd was born in Latta, South Carolina, on June 11, 1926, to Carlisle and Ida (née Fenegan) Floyd. His father was his namesake and a Methodist minister at the local church; on both sides his family was descended from among the first European immigrants to the Carolinas. He had a sister, Ermine, along with a sizable extended family. Being raised in the Southern United States, Floyd would have been well aquatinted with typical Southern ideals of the time, such as Southern hospitality, extra caution to avoid offending others, Protestantism and a general disliking towards the Northerners. Also prominent in his Southern upbringing were revival meetings, and the &quot;small-town bigotry,&quot; which later influenced his work. Though the family was not familiar with contemporary classical music, Floyd&#x27;s mother enjoyed music and poetry, often hosting family hymn singing events. She also gave Floyd his first piano lessons. Floyd attended North High School in North Carolina.

Though American involvement in World War II had begun in 1941, Floyd&#x27;s asthma prevented his conscription. He attended Converse College of Spartanburg, South Carolina, in 1944, studying piano with composer Ernst Bacon. In 1945 Bacon left Converse to become director of the music school at Syracuse University, New York, a considerably more multicultural institution. Floyd followed Bacon to Syracuse and received a Bachelor of Music in 1946. The following year, Floyd became part of the piano faculty at Florida State University in Tallahassee. He stayed there for thirty years, eventually becoming Professor of Composition. He received a master&#x27;s degree at Syracuse in 1949.

===Emerging composer and &quot;Susannah&quot;===
While at FSU, Floyd gradually became interested in composition. His first opera was &quot;Slow Dusk&quot; to his own libretto, and was produced at Syracuse in 1949. His next opera, &quot;The Fugitives&quot;, was seen at Tallahassee in 1951 but was withdrawn.

Floyd&#x27;s third opera was his greatest success: &quot;Susannah&quot;. It was premiered at Florida State at the Ruby Diamond Auditorium in February 1955, with Phyllis Curtin in the title role and Mack Harrell as the Reverend Olin Blitch. The following year, the opera was given at the New York City Opera, winning him international recognition. Erich Leinsdorf conducted, with Curtin and Norman Treigle as Blitch. The opera received the New York Music Critics&#x27; Circle Award. It was selected to be America&#x27;s official operatic entry at the 1958 World&#x27;s Fair in Brussels, directed by Frank Corsaro, with Curtin, Treigle and Richard Cassilly.

===Further operas===

Later in 1958, Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (after Emily Brontë) premiered at the Santa Fe Opera, with Curtin as the heroine. In 1960, at Syracuse, his solo cantata on biblical texts, &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, was first heard with Treigle as soloist. &quot;The Passion of Jonathan Wade&quot;, commissioned by the Ford Foundation, was Floyd&#x27;s most epic opera, set in South Carolina during the Reconstruction era. It was premiered at the New York City Opera on October 11, 1962. Theodor Uppman, Curtin, Treigle and Harry Theyard performed in a large cast, conducted by Julius Rudel and directed by Allen Fletcher. Floyd revised it in 1989 for performances at four major opera houses in the U.S., beginning at Houston Grand Opera.

Floyd&#x27;s next opera was &quot;The Sojourner and Mollie Sinclair&quot;, which was a comedy around Scottish settlers of the Carolinas. Patricia Neway and Treigle created the title roles with Rudel conducting. The opera &quot;Markheim&quot; (after Robert Louis Stevenson) was first shown at the New Orleans Opera Association in 1966, with Treigle (to whom it was dedicated) and Audrey Schuh heading the cast. Floyd himself served as stage director.

The opera &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (after John Steinbeck) was commissioned by the Ford Foundation. After a long gestation period, it was premiered at the Seattle Opera in 1970, directed by Corsaro. A monodrama on the royal subject of Eleanor of Aquitaine, &quot;Flower and Hawk&quot;, premiered in Jacksonville, Florida, with Curtin directed by Corsaro. The production was also presented at Carnegie Hall.

&quot;Bilby&#x27;s Doll&quot; (after Esther Forbes) was commissioned by the Houston Grand Opera where it was premiered in 1976 with Christopher Keene conducting and David Pountney directing. Floyd composed &quot;Willie Stark&quot; (after Robert Penn Warren) also for Houston, where it was first heard in 1981 in a staging by Harold Prince. After a hiatus of almost twenty years, another Floyd opera premiered in Houston in 2000, &quot;Cold Sassy Tree&quot; (after Olive Ann Burns). Patrick Summers conducted, Bruce Beresford directed, and Patricia Racette led the cast. It was subsequently produced by several American opera houses.

In 1976, he became M. D. Anderson professor at the University of Houston. There, he co-founded the Houston Opera Studio, together with David Gockley, as an institution of the University of Houston and Houston Grand Opera, with students including Michael Ching and Craig Bohmler.

===Retirement and later years===

After retirement from the university in Houston in 1996, Floyd lived in Tallahassee again. He had composed a Piano Sonata in the 1950s (1957, two years after &quot;Susannah&quot;) for Rudolf Firkušný, who played it at a Carnegie Hall recital, but it languished until Daniell Revenaugh recorded it in 2009 at the age of 74. Revenaugh worked with the composer in learning the piece (Floyd himself had never learned it), and their rehearsal sessions and the live recording itself were filmed for posterity. The recording was made on the Alma-Tadema Steinway that graced the White House during the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.

The Houston Grand Opera produced a new opera by Floyd on March 5, 2016, &quot;Prince of Players&quot;, a chamber opera about the 17th-century actor, Edward Kynaston, conducted by Summers. A live recording of the premiere was nominated for a Grammy Award.

Floyd died on September 30, 2021, in Tallahassee, at the age of 95. He had no children, but was survived by four nieces, the daughters of Ermine. His publisher Boosey and Hawkes, announced his death and did not relay the cause.

==Music==
===Legacy and reputation===
Floyd is primarily known for his operas, which make up the bulk of his compositional output. Like Wagner and Menotti, Floyd wrote the librettos to his operas. His best-known opera, &quot;Susannah&quot;, is regarded as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. The National Public Radio&#x27;s Tom Huizenga posits the work as suitable contender to be considered the archetypal &quot;Great American Opera&quot;. Patricia Racette declared that &quot;If it is not the greatest American opera, it&#x27;s certainly among the great American operas&quot;. According to &quot;Opera News&quot;, &quot;Susannah&quot; is the most frequently performed American opera after Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; and Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, however, claimed it is the most &quot;widely performed&quot; American opera, purportedly outnumbering some works by Mozart, Verdi and Puccini. In addition to Gershwin and Menotti, Floyd stands with Adams, Barber, Bernstein, Glass and Rorem in the pantheon of preeminent 20th-century American opera composers.

<text>Dermot Christopher Ahern (born 20 April 1955) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Justice and Law Reform from 2008 to 2011, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2004 to 2008, Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources from 2002 to 2004, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs from 1997 to 2002 and Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence from 1991 to 1992. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Louth constituency from 1987 to 2011.

==Early and private life==
Ahern was born in Dundalk, County Louth, in 1955. He was educated at the Marist College in Dundalk and later attended University College Dublin. Afterwards, he studied at the Law Society of Ireland and was admitted as a solicitor.

Ahern currently lives in Blackrock near Dundalk, with his wife and their two children. His pastimes include playing golf and windsurfing. He is a former Ulster windsurfing champion. Ahern is a former chairman of Rock Celtic soccer club and was also treasurer of Dundalk F.C. Supporter&#x27;s Club.

==Early political career==
Ahern was born into a family that had no association with party politics. He became involved in politics at a young age and became a member of Louth County Council in 1979 as a Fianna Fáil representative. He served on that authority until 1991 when he resigned due to the provisions of the Dual Mandate. Ahern was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1987 general election retaking the Dundalk based Fianna Fáil seat. The following year he was appointed assistant government chief whip by Taoiseach Charles Haughey. His Louth Fianna Fáil constituency colleague was already a Minister of State since 1987. 

Three years later in 1991, the Minister for Finance, Albert Reynolds, failed in his attempt to oust Haughey as leader. Ahern, who supported Haughey, was rewarded with the post of Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence. During this time period Ahern played a role in the germination of the Irish peace process during secret direct talks between members of Sinn Féin, Alec Reid and members of Fianna Fáil led by Martin Mansergh. Ahern also attended as a local Fianna Fáil minister along with Richie Healy in the Redemptorist Church, Dundalk. These were secret talks and would have been denied if disclosed publicly by political opponents or the media. In February 1992, Haughey was forced to resign and Albert Reynolds became party leader and Taoiseach. Ahern then became a backbencher for the entire duration of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party government. During this time Reynolds assumed sole ownership of the Fianna Fáil strategy for the Peace Process.

In late 1994, Bertie Ahern (no relation) succeeded Albert Reynolds as leader of Fianna Fáil. Ahern once again returned to the senior ranks of the party becoming chief whip. In 1997, he was sent to London to check out rumours that another senior party member, Ray Burke, had received a payment from Joseph Murphy. The claim was denied and Burke was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs two days later following the return to power of Fianna Fáil. Burke later served a jail sentence for corruption including the Murphy bribe. Ahern has since taken a stance on the issue of political corruption in Ireland publicly calling for an outright ban of corporate and trade union donations to political parties. This is now Fianna Fáil party policy. In the 1997 Irish presidential election Mary McAleese sought and won the Fianna Fáil nomination at the expense of Albert Reynolds. Ahern was a prominent supporter of her candidacy and in the election she received over 50% of the first preference vote in Louth as she did in each Border constituency.

In 2009 Ahern&#x27;s religious beliefs were questioned, especially in the way that his religious ideology may influence his political standpoint.

==Cabinet career==
===Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (1997–2002)===
Following the 1997 general election, a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats came to power, Ahern was appointed Minister for Community, Social and Family Affairs. As Social Affairs Minister Ahern also introduced the largest social welfare and pension increases in Irish history. He also achieved pension rights for Irish people who had emigrated from Ireland prior to 1953. The Accounts Section of the Department was decentralised to Dundalk from Dublin during his term incorporating the former SWLO in Barrack Street, Dundalk, which were merged into the same building as Dundalk Revenue Commissioners, to centralise service provision and staffing requirements under the one-roof. Ahern personally opened the new offices to the public while Minister.

===Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (2002–2004)===
Following the return of the government at the 2002 general election, Ahern was appointed Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In this post, he was critical of the main telecommunications provider eircom. His Department introduced a system of Policy Directions to the telecoms regulator mandating, amongst other things, Flat Rate Internet Access. It also devised the Ireland&#x27;s Broadband Action Plan which entailed the government building an alternative fibre infrastructure and co-location facilities. He sanctioned a reform package for public service broadcasting in Ireland and introduced a Charter for Ireland&#x27;s national broadcaster RTÉ. His Department introduced a programme to provide free broadband internet access to schools. He secured EU recognition and protection of the Irish Box, an area of Irish territorial waters out of bounds to Spanish and Portuguese fishermen.

===Minister for Foreign Affairs (2004–2008)===
Following a cabinet reshuffle in 2004, Ahern became Minister for Foreign Affairs, the first Louth TD to hold that position since Frank Aiken in the 1960s. Shortly into his tenure in April 2005, Ahern was appointed one of four special envoys for United Nations reform by the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.

Ahern spoke of the &#x27;Third Phase&#x27; in Irish foreign policy which he calls &quot;Active Neutrality&quot;. This is a vision of non-aligned Ireland taking up its international responsibilities by acting as a bridge between the developed and developing world, and by acting as a world leader in conflict and disasters. In this regard he took an extremely outspoken line on the crisis in Darfur, calling on the international community to &#x27;wake up to the reality of rape, murder and destruction in the region. More recently Ahern has announced the establishment of an Irish Volunteer Corps and a Rapid Response Corps which would harness existing expertise amongst the Irish public to assist in the developing world. He has stated that, in foreign policy terms, &#x27;the single greatest, economic, environmental, geopolitical issue now facing us is climate change.&#x27;

As Foreign Minister, Ahern was heavily involved in the Northern Ireland peace process. In 2006, he and several government leaders met regarding peace talks for Northern Ireland. Ahern met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain, US Ambassador to Ireland James C. Kenny, US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Robert H. Tuttle, the leadership of each of the main political parties involved in the process for peace, as well as three United States Congress members, James T. Walsh, Brian Higgins, and Tim Murphy. At the time of the meeting, there was a confirmation announcement of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) weapons decommissioning.

Ahern voiced concern over the 2006 Lebanon War. A shipment of bombs being sent to Israel by the United States was banned using Irish airspace or airfields.

Like many others in his party, therefore, Ahern describes himself as a republican, and made an associated statement regarding his self-identification at the 2006 Seán Moylan commemoration in Cork. At the 2006 Moylan commemoration, Ahern was quoted, stating: &quot;As an Irish Republican, my main personal and political goal is to live to see the unity of Ireland&quot;. In Dundalk he has been a regular attendee at Dundalk &amp; District Old IRA Commemorative events at Easter-time.

As Foreign Minister, he led a campaign to secure a path to permanent residency for the 25,000 to 50,000 undocumented Irish citizens resident in the United States. He also introduced free passports for Irish senior citizens and had called for a comprehensive ban on the use of cluster munitions. Ahern was the first government Minister to call for a constitutional referendum on the issues arising from the Supreme Court decision on statutory rape, five months before it became government policy.

After a call by the Irish Human Rights Commission that the Irish government inspect aircraft supposed to be a part of the US extraordinary rendition program, Ahern rejected these proposals. In a leaked diplomatic cable written by the US Ambassador to Ireland Thomas C. Foley, Foley reported that Ahern thought it &quot;might not be a bad idea to allow the random inspection of a few planes to proceed, which would provide cover if a rendition flight ever surfaced. He seemed quite convinced that at least three flights involving renditions had refuelled at Shannon Airport before or after conducting renditions elsewhere&quot;.

===Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (2008–2011)===
Ahern was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 7 May 2008, by the new Taoiseach Brian Cowen. On 29 April 2009, Ahern proposed a controversial amendment to the Defamation Bill adding the crime of blasphemy to the statute books.

The amendment was passed in the Dáil on 9 July 2009, with only an hour of the debate set aside for the bill, and was then narrowly passed by the Seanad the next day by walk-through vote, after being defeated in the initial electronic vote. This amendment has been criticised by many within the public sphere, free speech campaigners and some ministers of European Union member states. As of 2010, the law is in effect.

Ahern is responsible for the &quot;Civil Partnership Bill 2009&quot; published on 26 June 2009.

He received the Murphy Report into child sexual abuse in the Dublin Diocese in June 2009. Most of the report was published on 26 November 2009 of that year, though parts were not, due to names that were undergoing prosecution.

As part of a reshuffle in March 2010, the Equality affairs section of the department was moved to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.

Ahern said that in March 2010 he would propose to the Cabinet a constitutional amendment deleting the constitutional prohibition on blasphemy when the children&#x27;s rights amendment comes up. Ahern was opposed to a stand-alone referendum that would have cost €3 or €4 million, his spokesman added. At the time, Ahern wrote in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;: &quot;My intention is to remove the possibility of prison sentences and private prosecutions for blasphemy, currently provided for in Irish law. The only credible alternative to this move is a blasphemy referendum, which I consider, in the current circumstances, a costly and unwarranted diversion.&quot;

On 15 November 2010, he described as &#x27;fiction&#x27; the speculation that Ireland was about to seek financial aid from the European Union. He told RTÉ&#x27;s The Week in Politics that &#x27;nothing is going on at the direction of Government in relation to this.&#x27; On 21 November 2010, the Taoiseach Brian Cowen confirmed that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Union&#x27;s European Financial Stability Facility and the International Monetary Fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTE 21/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
On 30 November 2010, he announced he would not contest his Dáil seat at the 2011 general election, as he has rheumatoid arthritis, and said it was a &quot;painful medical condition necessitating heavy medication&quot;. He retired to a combined annual ministerial and TD&#x27;s pension of €128,300. He resigned as Minister for Justice and Law Reform on 19 January 2011.

==Comments during debate on decriminalisation of homosexuality==
During the debate on decriminalisation of homosexuality in the Dáil in 1993, he agreed with a statement by Brendan McGahon which reads: &quot;Homosexuality is a departure from normality and while homosexuals deserve our compassion they do not deserve our tolerance&quot; and who described homosexuals as being &quot;like lefthand drivers driving on the right-hand side of the road&quot;.

Ahern himself added: &quot;Will we eventually see the day in this country when, as has happened in the USA, homosexuals will seek the right to adopt children? We should think seriously about this possibility&quot;. Following his appointment as Minister responsible for equality, Ahern refused to be drawn on the matter and did not give an answer as to whether he still held these opinions.

==Civil partnership==
Ahern was responsible for introducing legislation recognising civil partnerships for same-sex couples. He declared the legislation (Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010), which passed into law in July 2010, as &quot;one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation to be enacted since independence&quot;.

==Controversy over Michael McKevitt==

Dermot Ahern denied claims that he had made representations to former Minister for Justice Michael McDowell on behalf of Michael McKevitt, who has been convicted of directing terrorism. He said that had merely forwarded an email from McKevitts&#x27; wife, Bernadette Sands McKevitt, who was a constituent in 2004.

His brother-in-law, Shane Coleman, is currently a journalist with Newstalk FM.

<doc id="316092" wikidata="Q241941" url="?curid=316092" title="The Score (2001 film)">
<text>The Score is a 2001 American heist film directed by Frank Oz, and starring Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Angela Bassett, and Marlon Brando in his final film role. It was the only time that Brando and De Niro appeared onscreen together. The screenplay was based on a story by Daniel E. Taylor and Kario Salem.

== Plot ==
After nearly being caught during a burglary, master safe-cracker Nick Wells considers retiring to live with his girlfriend Diane and run his Montréal jazz club as a legitimate businessman. He declines another job from his fence Max, and is approached by the job&#x27;s mastermind Jack Teller, an ambitious fellow thief. Nick sends his associate Burt to intimidate Jack into leaving town, but Jack gains the upper hand and arrives at Nick&#x27;s home to change his mind. Nick agrees to join the heist in exchange for total control of the operation, and negotiates a $6 million cut from Max.

Their target is a royal sceptre smuggled into Canada but discovered by customs, now stored in the ultra-secure basement of the Montréal Customs House. Jack has infiltrated the Customs House by posing as a mentally challenged janitor, and Nick finds access to the basement through the sewers beneath. Diane, disappointed that Nick has taken on this final score, reconsiders their future together.

Nick recruits Steven, a hacker associate, who breaks into the Customs House security company&#x27;s system to obtain bypass codes, but is caught by a systems administrator who demands $50,000 for the information. The administrator arranges to meet in a public park, bringing his cousin for protection; tensions arise when the cousin and Jack each reveal they have brought a gun, to Nick&#x27;s displeasure, but the exchange is made.

After seeing a pressurized beer keg burst open in the street, Nick concocts a plan to defeat the Customs House&#x27;s impregnable safe. He frustrates Jack by urging patience and refusing to let him be part of the handoff with Max, despite Jack&#x27;s insistence. Advised by Burt that the job may be too risky, Nick confronts Max, who confesses that he is deeply in debt to a mob boss but is secretly selling the sceptre for $30 million. Max implores him to finish the job, and Nick reluctantly agrees.

The Customs House adds additional closed-circuit television cameras and infrared detectors to the basement after realizing the sceptre&#x27;s true value as a French national treasure, forcing the thieves to move up their timetable. Jack arrives for his graveyard shift — with his gun hidden inside a portable radio — while Nick breaks into the basement through the sewer tunnels. Burt, posing as a garbage truck driver, delivers computer components that Jack uses to bypass the security system. Jack shuts off the cameras as Nick enters the storage room, but a fellow janitor stumbles upon Jack, who locks him in a closet at gunpoint.

Bypassing the infrared sensors, Nick fills the safe with water from the basement sprinkler system and inserts a depth charge, blowing off the door. He packs the sceptre in a carrying case but is held at gunpoint by Jack, who forces him to hand over the case. As rigged by Jack, the cameras and alarms turn back on, alerting security and forcing Nick to escape back through the sewers; Jack returns upstairs, hiding the case inside his uniform and slipping past the police as they arrive.

Arriving at a bus station to flee the city, Jack calls Nick to gloat, but Nick reveals that he anticipated his betrayal: he had already planned a route through the sewers to evade pursuit, and Jack opens the case to discover a scrap metal decoy; Nick still has the real sceptre. Brushing off Jack&#x27;s threats of vengeance, Nick advises him to flee as &quot;every cop in the city&quot; will now be looking for him. Later, Max smiles as he watches a news broadcast reporting a massive manhunt to find Jack, the prime suspect, whose accomplice has &quot;vanished without a trace,&quot; while Nick reunites with Diane at Montréal-Mirabel International Airport.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
During the production, Brando repeatedly argued with Oz and called him &quot;Miss Piggy&quot;, the Muppet whom Oz played from 1976 to 2001. Brando&#x27;s eccentric behavior on set included performing scenes in his underwear and altogether refusing to be directed by Oz at times, having co-star De Niro take over with Oz instructing via an assistant director, an allegation that Oz confirmed. &quot;There was one scene–two days of shooting–when Marlon was too upset with me to act while I was on the set,&quot; Oz stated. &quot;I watched from outside, with a monitor, and Bob was very good and acted as mediator between us.&quot;

Screenwriter Scott Marshall Smith joined the crew late and received a writing credit.

Oz downplayed the conflict after the film&#x27;s release, taking unspoken note of the reported tension between himself and Brando on the movie&#x27;s Montreal set: 

Oz later blamed himself for the tension and cited his tendency to be confrontational rather than nurturing in response to Brando&#x27;s acting style.

== Home media ==
The film was released on VHS and DVD on December 11, 2001.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
In its opening weekend, the film opened at No. 2 in the U.S. box office raking in $19 million, behind &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;. After its July 13, 2001 opening, the $68 million film earned a gross domestic box office take of $71,107,711. Combined with the international box office, the worldwide total is $113,579,918.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 73% based on 127 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though the movie treads familiar ground in the heist/caper genre, De Niro, Norton, and Brando make the movie worth watching.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three and a half out of four, calling it &quot;the best pure heist movie in recent years&quot;.

Peter Travers, film critic for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, pointed out that when &quot;two Don Corleones team up&quot;, he expected &quot;the kind of movie that makes people say, &#x27;I&#x27;d pay to see these guys just read from the phone book&#x27;&quot;. However, he concluded, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t see coming in this flick, including the surprise ending. Quick, somebody get a phone book.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
Angela Bassett won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for her portrayal of Nick&#x27;s girlfriend, Diane.

<text>Séamus Brennan ( ; 16 February 1948 – 9 July 2008) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism from 2007 to 2008, Minister for Social and Family Affairs from 2004 to 2007, Minister for Transport from 1989 to 1992 and 2002 to 2004, Government Chief Whip from 1997 to 2002, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment from 1993 to 1994, Minister for Education from 1992 to 1993 and Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce from 1987 to 1989. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South constituency from 1981 to 2008. He also served as a Senator from 1977 to 1981, after being nominated by the Taoiseach.

==Early life==
Brennan was born in Galway in 1948. He was educated at St. Joseph&#x27;s Patrician College in Galway. He attended University College Galway, graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce in 1968 and a Bachelor of Arts (Economics) the following year. He attended University College Dublin too. He qualified as an accountant. Brennan found an interest in politics during his teens when he canvassed for Fianna Fáil during elections. In 1973, he succeeded Tommy Mullins as General Secretary of Fianna Fáil. He began to revamp the party structure; this included setting up a youth section and a national executive. He studied and was impressed by the 1976 United States presidential election. He applied new techniques such as marketing strategies and opinion polls to the 1977 general election. This resulted in the biggest-ever parliamentary majority for any party; Fianna Fáil and Jack Lynch were back in power with a 20-seat majority. Brennan was appointed to Seanad Éireann as a Senator.

==Political career==
In 1979, Brennan supported George Colley in the Fianna Fáil leadership election caused by the retirement of Jack Lynch. However, Charles Haughey was narrowly elected as leader and a new Secretary General of the party was appointed. At the 1981 general election, Brennan was elected to Dáil Éireann for Dublin South and was returned at every subsequent election until his death in 2008. In the early 1980s, he was a prominent member of the Gang of 22 who tried unsuccessfully to wrest control of the Fianna Fáil party from Haughey. He supported Colley and later Desmond O&#x27;Malley in various leadership heaves during those years. It was widely expected that Brennan would join the Progressive Democrats when they were founded by O&#x27;Malley in 1985, but he remained within Fianna Fáil.

In 1987, Fianna Fáil returned to office and Brennan was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce with responsibility for trade and marketing. In 1989, he was appointed to cabinet minister as Minister for Tourism and Transport. In 1991, his portfolio was widened to Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. In February 1992, Albert Reynolds succeeded Haughey as Taoiseach, with Brennan being one of the few ministers in Haughey&#x27;s cabinet who Reynolds retained in cabinet. He was appointed Minister for Education. In January 1993, a Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition came to office and Brennan was demoted to Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for commerce and technology. He remained in this position until 1994.

From November 1994, Fianna Fáil were again in opposition, and the new party leader Bertie Ahern designated Brennan as Opposition Spokesperson for Transport, Energy and Communications. In 1997, Fianna Fáil returned to power and Brennan was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. He was appointed as Minister for Transport in 2002.

In the cabinet reshuffle of September 2004, Brennan was moved to the post of Minister for Social and Family Affairs. He was bitterly disappointed but he refused to describe it as a demotion. After the 2007 general election, he played a key role in the negotiations with the Green Party which led to the formation of the new Government. He did not seek ministerial office in Brian Cowen&#x27;s cabinet and tendered his resignation on 6 May 2008, for medical reasons.

==Political views==
Brennan’s political views were shaped by a combination of social liberalism and free-market economics. He supported legal reforms such as the legalisation of divorce and the unrestricted availability of contraception, advocating for greater social freedoms. On economic matters, Brennan championed market-driven policies aimed at encouraging enterprise and reducing state intervention in the economy. His focus was on promoting exports, updating company laws, and facilitating the growth of small businesses. Brennan also sought to modernise Ireland&#x27;s infrastructure, playing a key role in transport projects and pushing for reforms in the education and welfare systems. While supportive of the social partnership model, he was also critical of certain aspects, such as the tax policies of previous governments. 

==Death==
Brennan died in the early hours of 9 July 2008 at his home in Churchtown in Dublin. He had been suffering from cancer. He is survived by his wife Ann, their two sons and four daughters. Taoiseach Brian Cowen said Brennan would be remembered as &quot;a brilliant political strategist, a dedicated constituency TD, a reforming minister and a very popular colleague&quot;.

==By-election==
His death brought about a by-election at which his son Shay Brennan was the unsuccessful Fianna Fáil candidate. It was won by George Lee of Fine Gael.

His son Shay Brennan was elected to the Dáil for the Dublin Rathdown constituency at the 2024 general election.

<text>William Lamar Beane III (born March 29, 1962) is an American former professional baseball player and current front office executive. He is currently senior advisor to owner John Fisher and minority owner of the Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB) and formerly the executive vice president of baseball operations. He is also minority owner of soccer clubs Barnsley of the EFL League One in England and AZ Alkmaar of the Eredivisie in the Netherlands. From 1984 to 1989 he played in MLB as an outfielder for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, and Oakland Athletics. He joined the Athletics&#x27; front office as a scout in 1990, was named general manager after the 1997 season, and was promoted to executive vice president after the 2015 season. 

A first-round pick in the MLB draft by the Mets, Beane failed to meet the expectations of scouts, who projected him as a star. In his front-office career, Beane has applied statistical analysis (known as sabermetrics) to baseball, which has led teams to reconsider how they evaluate players. He is the subject of Michael Lewis&#x27;s 2003 book on baseball economics, &quot;&quot;, which was made into a 2011 film starring Brad Pitt as Beane.

==Early life==
Beane grew up in Mayport, Florida, and San Diego, California, the child of a career military family. His father, a naval officer, taught him how to pitch.

Beane attended Mt. Carmel High School in San Diego, where he excelled at baseball, football, and basketball. The high school coach added Beane to the varsity baseball team for the last game of his freshman season. Beane batted .501 during his sophomore and junior years of high school. In his senior season, his batting average dropped to .300.

Despite the decrease in batting average, scouts were enamored with Beane&#x27;s talent. Beane gave up football to avoid an injury that could prematurely end his baseball career. Despite this, Stanford University tried to recruit Beane on a joint baseball–football scholarship as the quarterback who would succeed then-sophomore John Elway for the Stanford Cardinal football team.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
The New York Mets, who had the first overall selection of the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft, liked Beane&#x27;s talent and considered choosing him with the first pick. Because many teams believed he would attend Stanford and not sign with a professional team, Beane fell to the 23rd pick, where he was taken by the Mets, who had two other first-round picks that year, allowing them to risk Beane not signing. After visiting the Mets clubhouse, Beane decided to sign with the Mets for a signing bonus. Beane called his decision to sign with the Mets instead of going to Stanford as the &quot;only decision he would ever make in his life about money.&quot;

Believing Beane to be a more refined player than their top first round pick, Darryl Strawberry, the Mets assigned Strawberry to play rookie ball with other high school draftees while Beane was assigned to the Little Falls Mets of the Class A New York–Penn League, with players drafted out of college. Beane struggled in his first season, batting .210. He was unable to make the adjustments necessary when playing tougher competition. The Mets promoted Beane to the Lynchburg Mets of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in 1981. After a solid season, he was promoted to the Jackson Mets of the Class AA Texas League in 1982. While Strawberry was the league&#x27;s most valuable player, Beane batted .220. Beane began questioning himself, while his new roommate, Lenny Dykstra, succeeded with unwavering confidence and superior mental focus.

===New York Mets (1984–1985)===

Beane remained in Jackson until 1984, when he received his first promotion to MLB, appearing in five games for the 1984 New York Mets. In 1985, Beane spent most of the season with the Tidewater Tides of the Class AAA International League, getting called up to the 1985 Mets for eight games. He batted .284 for the Tides in 1985, leading the team with 19 home runs and 77 runs batted in.

===Minnesota Twins (1986–1987)===
Following the season, the Mets traded Beane with Joe Klink and Bill Latham to the Minnesota Twins for Tim Teufel and Pat Crosby, a minor league player.

The Twins entered spring training prepared to give Beane the job as their starting left fielder over incumbent Mickey Hatcher, but he dealt with injuries and ineffectiveness. Beane appeared in 80 games for the 1986 Minnesota Twins, batting .216. He also appeared in 32 games for the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. The Twins sent Beane to their new Class-AAA affiliate, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), after spring training in 1987. After batting .285 for Portland, Beane received a call-up to the Twins after the September 1 roster expansion. He appeared in 12 games for the 1987 Minnesota Twins.

===Detroit Tigers (1988)===
The Twins traded Beane to the Detroit Tigers for Balvino Gálvez during spring training in 1988. He made the Tigers&#x27; opening-day roster that season as an injury fill-in, and was optioned in late April to Toledo, now serving as Detroit&#x27;s Class-AAA affiliate, where he spent most of the season. During this time, he played in the same outfield as another player with nearly the same name—Billy Bean—and also had a teammate with the name Rice. Beane appeared in six games for the 1988 Tigers.

===Oakland Athletics (1989)===
Granted free agency after the 1988 season, Beane signed with the Oakland Athletics, appearing in 37 games with the 1989 Athletics, batting .241 in 79 at-bats. Beane spent most of the season with the Class-AAA Tacoma Tigers of the PCL. He re-signed with the Athletics for the 1990 season, and was sent down to the minor leagues at the end of spring training.

==Post-playing career==
Weary of the lifestyle of a minor league player, Beane approached Athletics GM Sandy Alderson a day after he was reassigned to minor league camp in April 1990 for a job as an advance scout.

==Executive career==
Beane held the position of advance scout through 1993, when he was promoted to assistant GM of the Athletics, tasked with scouting minor-league players.

Under the ownership of Walter A. Haas Jr., the Athletics appeared in three consecutive World Series from 1988 through 1990, and had the highest payroll in baseball in 1991. Haas died in 1995, and new owners Stephen Schott and Ken Hofmann ordered Alderson to slash payroll. To field a competitive roster on a limited budget, Alderson began focusing on sabermetric principles to obtain undervalued players. He valued on-base percentage among hitters. Alderson taught Beane to find value that other teams did not see using sabermetrics.

===Oakland Athletics (1997–2015)===
Beane succeeded Alderson as GM on October 17, 1997. He continued Alderson&#x27;s crafting of the Athletics into one of the most cost-effective teams in baseball. For example, in the 2006 MLB season, the Athletics ranked 24th of 30 major league teams in player salaries but had the 5th-best regular-season record.
The Athletics reached the playoffs in four consecutive years from 2000 through 2003, losing in the American League Division Series each year. In 2002, the Athletics became the first team in the 100+ years of American League (AL) baseball to win 20 consecutive games. After the 2002 season, the Boston Red Sox made Beane an offer of $12.5 million to become their GM, but he declined. On April 15, 2005, Beane received a contract extension to remain with the Athletics as the team&#x27;s general manager through 2012, and new team owner Lewis Wolff awarded Beane a small portion of the team&#x27;s ownership. They won their first playoff series under Beane in 2006 when they swept the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division Series, but were swept by the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series.

From their 2006 playoff appearance until 2012, the Athletics did not make the playoffs or finish above .500, which triggered criticism of Beane and his approach in some quarters, especially in 2009. Beane largely dismisses criticism of his approach, indicating that his philosophy revolves around research and analysis. Many other general managers have followed Beane&#x27;s strategy and now use similar approaches. In December 2009, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Beane #10 on its list of the Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade in all sports. 

While &quot;Moneyball&quot; had already changed how MLB players were valued, Beane had begun concentrating on high school players, a group he once largely ignored, in the MLB draft, considering them to be heavily undervalued. He and other like-minded GMs also changed their draft strategies to focus more on defensive skills, which became undervalued in the years immediately after the Moneyball revolution. This new emphasis on defense was displayed in the 2010 season; although the Athletics finished at .500 and again missed the playoffs, they led MLB in defensive efficiency, measured as the percentage of balls put into play by opponents that resulted in outs, and allowed the fewest runs in the AL. In February 2012, the Athletics extended Beane&#x27;s contract through 2019. In the 2012 season, the Athletics again made the playoffs under Beane, winning the AL West title on the last day of the regular season. The Athletics returned to the playoffs in 2013 by winning the American League West division title again, the team&#x27;s first back-to-back division championships since the 2002 and 2003 seasons.

On October 5, 2015, the Athletics announced that Beane had been promoted to executive vice president of baseball operations. Assistant GM David Forst assumed the job of general manager. In November 2022, Beane transitioned into a new role as senior advisor to owner John Fisher, and Forst became the new head of baseball operations.

==Activities outside baseball==
===Soccer===
When the Athletics ownership group agreed to purchase the reincarnation of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, Beane, who has expressed a passion for soccer, began developing a system for objectively analyzing soccer players. He has agreed to help the Earthquakes front office develop a method for building a cost-effective team, as the salary cap in MLS is even more restrictive than the Athletics status as a small-market team in Major League Baseball. However, a system has yet to be implemented.

Beane has regarded Arsenal&#x27;s former manager Arsène Wenger as a personal idol. Beane has held discussions with Wenger, former Manchester United F.C. manager Alex Ferguson, and Liverpool F.C. owner John W. Henry. His friendship with ex-Arsenal scout Damien Comolli and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke allowed him to delve deep into the world of English soccer.

In March 2015, the Dutch soccer club AZ Alkmaar, under general director Robert Eenhoorn, a former major leaguer, hired Beane as an advisor. He became a shareholder of the club five years later. acquiring a 5% stake in 2020. On December 19, 2017, Beane became part of a consortium led by Chien Lee to purchase Barnsley Football Club, which plays in the EFL League One, the third tier of the English football league system.

===Software industry===
On January 4, 2007, the software company NetSuite named Beane to its board of directors; NetSuite co-founder Evan Goldberg cited Beane&#x27;s ability to combine facts with instinct. Beane also served as a consultant for, and appears in, the video game &quot;MLB Front Office Manager&quot;.

===&quot;Moneyball&quot;===
Author Michael Lewis&#x27; 2003 best-selling book &quot;,&quot; explores Beane&#x27;s methods as the GM of the Athletics and how he, along with Paul DePodesta, used sabermetric principles to field a winning team despite an exceptionally low payroll. The book and Beane&#x27;s methods influenced the way many teams and players think about the game of baseball.

The book was made into the 2011 film &quot;Moneyball&quot;, in which Beane was portrayed by Brad Pitt, whose performance earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.

==Personal life==
Beane&#x27;s first marriage was to Cathy Sturdivant. The couple has a daughter, Casey Beane.

Beane is married to Tara Beane. The couple have twins, Brayden and Tinsley Beane.

Beane attended the University of California, San Diego during the baseball off-seasons of his playing career.

<doc id="316097" wikidata="Q2347373" url="?curid=316097" title="List of Esperanto-language films">
<text>The following is a list of Esperanto-language films including features and documentaries. Esperanto was created in the late 1870s and early 1880s.

==Feature films==
There are four feature films known to have been shot exclusively in the constructed language Esperanto. Both &quot;Angoroj&quot; (&quot;Agonies&quot;) and &quot;Incubus&quot; were shot in the 1960s, and both were long thought lost until restorations emerged in the 2010s.

&quot;Angoroj&quot; was produced in France in 1964 and directed by Atelier Mahé. It runs approximately one hour and its story involves murder. After a restoration and home video release (in the PAL format) in Switzerland, the film became unavailable until 2019. Little detailed information about &quot;Angoroj&quot; is available, except that the cast included some proficient Esperantists, including Raymond Schwartz, who also directed skits for Parisian Esperanto cabarets.

The second feature was the 1965 American production &quot;Incubus&quot;, a low-budget black-and-white horror film directed by the creator of the television series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and starring William Shatner. Though the film is admired for its stark artistry, many Esperantists find that the actors spoke with poor pronunciation.

The 2006 film &quot;Gerda malaperis!&quot; (&quot;Gerda Disappeared!&quot;) and 2007 film &quot;La patro&quot; (&quot;The Father&quot;) were produced by the Brazilian Esperanto film production company Imagu-filmoj.

==Documentaries==
Earlier examples of Esperanto in film consist mainly of old newsreel and documentary footage, some dating back as early as 1911, when the seventh international Esperanto conference was held in Antwerp, Belgium. The funeral of Esperanto creator L. L. Zamenhof in 1917 was filmed. French cinema sync sound pioneer, Léon Gaumont, made a short film about a Procession of supporters of Esperanto. In 2011, Academy Award-nominated director Sam Green (&quot;The Weather Underground&quot;), released a new documentary in 2011 about Esperanto titled &quot;The Universal Language&quot; (La Universala Lingvo). This 30-minute film traces the history of Esperanto.

==Films of Christopher Mihm==
Starting with &quot;Attack of the Moon Zombies&quot;, Christopher Mihm has dubbed eight of his self-described &quot;new old good bad&quot; films into Esperanto:

* &quot;The Monster of Phantom Lake&quot;
* &quot;Attack of the Moon Zombies&quot;
* &quot;House of Ghosts&quot;
* &quot;The Giant Spider&quot;
* &quot;The Late Night Double Feature&quot;
* &quot;Danny Johnson Saves The World&quot;
* &quot;Demon with the Atomic Brain&quot;
* &quot;Queen of Snakes&quot;

== Use of Esperanto in film and television ==
*1924: The silent film &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;, directed by F.W. Murnau from a screenplay by Carl Mayer, features street signs, posters, and shop signs written in pseudo-Esperanto.
* 1931: The Esperanto novel &quot;Mr. Tot Aĉetas Mil Okulojn&quot;, written by Polish author Jean Forge and published in this year, was adapted by Fritz Lang as &quot;The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse&quot; in 1960. (The film was in German, not Esperanto.) Forge also directed films of his own, at least two of which are known to have been Esperanto productions, &quot;Morgaŭ Ni Komencos la Vivon&quot; (1934) and &quot;Verda Stelo Super Varsovio&quot; (1959). It is unknown if either film survives.
*1939: &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;, starring Norma Shearer and Clark Gable, features &#x27;locals&#x27; of an unidentified European country speaking Esperanto. The language also appears in written form (e.g., a sign reading &quot;Autobuso&quot;).
*1939: &quot;Lady of the Tropics&quot;, starring Robert Taylor and Hedy Lamarr, contains two Esperanto words, &quot;Estas bone&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s all right&quot;), said by a woman after Taylor apologizes to her for mistaking her for Lamarr.
*1940: &quot;Road to Singapore&quot;, starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, features a song with Esperanto lyrics sung by a chorus of natives of Kaigoon, a fictional island in the East Indies.
*1940: &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; starring Charlie Chaplin, who also wrote and directed the film, deliberately decided to have the signs in the shop windows, of the ghettoized Jewish population, written in Esperanto, instead of German, in order to leave the comparison of Nazi Germany to the audience. Another meaning for its usage is Adolf Hitler&#x27;s opinion that for the Jews to dominate the world, they will need a universal language such as Esperanto.
*1966: &quot;Incubus&quot; with William Shatner. The first gothic horror movie filmed entirely in Esperanto, directed by Leslie Stevens.
*1976: &quot;La ciutat cremada&quot; (&quot;The Burnt City&quot;)
*1980s: The British science fiction comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (which began in 1988) is set on a bilingual spaceship where the signs on the walls are written in both English and Esperanto (for example, the corridor on each level is labelled &quot;Level/Nivelo [###]&quot;, and a sign in a movie theatre says &quot;Cinema/Kinejo&quot;) – but this only lasted for the first two series; afterward a redesign of the sets eliminated the Esperanto. Only one episode (Series 2 episode 1, &quot;Kryten&quot;) actually features a significant amount of Esperanto being spoken: in the opening scene, the character of Rimmer is attempting to learn Esperanto from an instructional video and failing miserably (although his underachieving bunkmate Lister can understand it perfectly). In a later episode (Series 5 episode 6, &quot;Back to Reality&quot;), aired in 1992, the crew encounter an &quot;ocean seeding ship&quot; named the &quot;SSS Esperanto&quot;. Later, when their entire lives are revealed, falsely, to have all been a computer game, the Esperanto translation of Esperanto as &quot;One Who Hopes&quot; is said to have been a clue to use that ship&#x27;s functioning lasers to defeat the &quot;Despair Squid&quot;.
*1985: &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot;, a Japanese anime film (based on the novel by Kenji Miyazawa), all the signs are written in Esperanto, to reflect the distinct but unspecific European ambiance of the town and also as a tribute to Miyazawa&#x27;s interest in the language.
*1987: In the film &quot;Već viđeno&quot; (&quot;Déjà Vu&quot;), by Serbian director Goran Marković, one of the main character&#x27;s colleagues is an Esperanto teacher. A few short scenes take place in the Esperanto class. Later the teacher is heckled when he recites from an Esperanto translation of &quot;The Mountain Wreath&quot; at a school performance.
*1994: &quot;Street Fighter&quot; street signs and labels are in Esperanto; also background speech and even the anthem of Shadaloo, sung in the movie, are in Esperanto.
*1997: Esperanto also makes an appearance in Andrew Niccol&#x27;s science fiction drama &quot;Gattaca&quot;, where announcements are read in Esperanto and English.
*2002: &quot;Que Sera, Sera&quot;, a Norwegian short film directed and produced by Geir Greni, tells the story of the new president of a fictionalized version of the country&#x27;s Esperanto association and his attempts to drum up new members for the organization on the eve of its annual convention. Part of the spoken dialogue is in Esperanto.
*2004: The movie &quot;&quot; takes place in a generic city which writer/director David Goyer nevertheless wanted to represent as bilingual (as many cities are worldwide), so the second language spoken in this nameless city, and visible on most of its signage, is Esperanto.
*2004: In the Spanish film &quot;El coche de pedales&quot;, one of the main characters is a teacher of Esperanto. There are some scenes in which he greets people with &quot;Saluton&quot; or &quot;Dankon&quot;, and a scene of one of his lectures, in which he reads a tale in Esperanto.
*2004: In the Korean amateur animation named &quot;Esperanto&quot; directed by Zacho Oh – which received a prize in the Digital Content Grand Prix – the final sentence that can be heard in the film is in Esperanto.
*2004: On the Nickelodeon animated show &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; a limited run character named Wulf was featured who spoke exclusively in Esperanto.
*2005: A short film named &quot;Esperanto&quot; was released, with scenes in French and Esperanto.
*2005: &quot;Casarosa&quot; is a film by the First Channel of Russian television. The three-part film is a detective story, based on the novel by Leonid Yuzefovich, about events taking place in an Esperanto club in the 1920s. In some scenes people speak and sing in Esperanto, or discuss it in Russian.
*2009: A short film &quot;Senmova&quot; in Esperanto directed by Tugce Sen.
*2010: In the movie &quot;Superman/Batman: Apocalypse&quot; a mix of Esperanto and gibberish is used as the Kryptonian language.
*2011: The short animated film &quot;Ĉapeloj&quot; contains no spoken dialogue, and instead employs the use of visual gags that are based on puns found in Esperanto. Animated and produced by Simmon Keith Barney.
*2012: The Japanese animated film &quot;&quot; of the Doraemon series has several characters speaking Esperanto until Doraemon produces a translating device.
*2013: In the Japanese anime film &quot;Patema Inverted&quot;, the ending theme, &quot;Patema Inverse&quot;, is sung in Esperanto.
*2014: In 12th episode (&quot;Diggs&quot;) in season 25 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Principal Skinner says a few phrases in Esperanto.
*2016: In the movie &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; the two daughters speak fluent Esperanto during the bus ride to the city.
*2017: In a season 15 episode of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, it is revealed Simmons learned Esperanto in an effort to communicate with Lopez, who only speaks Spanish. Several of Simmons&#x27;s lines in the episode are in Esperanto.
*2020: In the movie &quot;Rose Island&quot;, it is decided to use Esperanto as the official language of the Republic when looking for a language to sustain the international recognition of the would-be microstate.

<doc id="316101" wikidata="Q7427283" url="?curid=316101" title="Saul Cherniack">
<text>Saul Mark Cherniack, (January 10, 1917 – March 30, 2018) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1962 to 1981, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Edward Schreyer. He was also a member of the Privy Council, the Order of Canada and the Order of Manitoba.

==Early life and career==
Cherniack&#x27;s grandfather, who was a dealer of Judaica, emigrated to Canada from Russia and then brought over Cherniack&#x27;s grandmother, father, and aunt in 1905; Cherniack was politician David Orlikow&#x27;s first cousin.

Cherniack was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His parents, Joseph Alter Cherniack and Fanya Golden, had been revolutionaries in Russia and had been briefly imprisoned before coming to Canada in 1905. Alter Cherniack became a prominent member of Winnipeg&#x27;s Jewish community and leading supporter of the Independent Labour Party and Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the city&#x27;s north end. Alter Cherniack was a watchmaker by training but eventually earned his BA and law degree in Canada and became law partners with Malick Spivak whose son, Sidney Spivak, would go on to be Leader of the Opposition as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in the 1970s while Cherniack was in government.

Cherniack&#x27;s parents helped found the I.L. Peretz School, the first Yiddish day school in North America and were also involved with Yiddish theatre.

Cherniack himself was involved with a left-wing theatre group in the 1930s. He was educated at the University of Manitoba (receiving a law degree in 1939), and was active in the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and in the Jewish community of Winnipeg. He began practising law in 1940. From 1943 to 1946, he served in the Royal Canadian Artillery and then in the Intelligence Corps of the Canadian Army as a Japanese language specialist, reaching the rank of captain.

After World War II, Cherniack resumed his law practice and was one of three lawyers in Canada who worked on behalf of Japanese Canadians who had been interned during the war years in an attempt to have them paid compensation for property seized from them by the government.

He was elected as a trustee on the Winnipeg School Board in 1950, serving until 1954, and then served as a councillor in the town of Winnipeg Beach in 1958-59, a Winnipeg alderman in 1959-60, and a councillor on the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg from 1960 to 1962. In 1938, he married Sybil Claire Zeal.

In the late 1950s, he served as president of both the Jewish Welfare Fund of Winnipeg and the western branch of the Canadian Jewish Congress.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1962 provincial election, in the north-end Winnipeg riding of St. Johns. He was re-elected in the elections of 1966, 1969, 1973 and 1977, each time by a significant margin.

In 1968-69, Cherniack was a key figure in the provincial NDP calling for Edward Schreyer to replace Russell Paulley as party leader. He initially considered challenging Paulley himself, but declined, reportedly on the advice of NDP research adviser Doug Rowland. Those who supported Sidney Green contended that Cherniack did not run because of concerns that a Jewish party leader would not have been acceptable to the general public in the late 1960s; they later attributed his lack of support for Green to the same reason. (Russell Doern once quoted Cherniack as saying &quot;I do not believe that Manitoba is ready for a Jewish Premier&quot; in announcing his decision to others in the party.) Cherniack denied that, saying that his decision not to run himself was based on his lack of ambition for power, and his support of Schreyer was based on Schreyer&#x27;s leadership qualities.

When Sidney Green challenged Paulley for the party leadership in late 1968, Cherniack and seven other MLAs supported Paulley on condition that he stand down the following year in favour of Schreyer. Paulley was confirmed as leader and resigned the following year, at which time Schreyer defeated Green for the party leadership. The NDP under Schreyer formed a minority government following the 1969 election.

==Cabinet minister==
On July 17, 1969, Cherniack was appointed provincial Minister of Finance. He was also given the Urban Affairs portfolio for a brief period in 1970, and was responsible for amalgamating the suburbs and inner city of Winnipeg into one large municipality, the first such unification in North America. He remained one of Schreyer&#x27;s most trusted confidantes throughout the 1970s.

During his time in office, Cherniack was respected for his intellectual rigour and integrity, and was known as one of the most dignified members of the Manitoba Assembly. He resigned the finance portfolio on November 13, 1972, returned to office on May 2, 1973, and resigned a second time in January 1975.

When Edward Schreyer resigned as party leader in 1979, Cherniack offered to serve as interim leader until a party convention could be held. He set a number of conditions to this offer, however; those who supported Green contended that he was trying to secure the leadership for either himself or Wilson Parasiuk. At a caucus vote Green and Howard Pawley contested Cherniack&#x27;s interim leadership, and he received only three votes for the position of interim leader. Howard Pawley, the successful candidate, subsequently named him as the party&#x27;s deputy leader.

Cherniack announced his retirement from political life in October 1980, saying &quot;I am selfish enough to want a little more private life and have for some time [...] There comes a time in a person&#x27;s life when he has a right to say I want to be relieved of the burden&quot;. Cherniack criticized the Manitoba New Democratic Party&#x27;s recent leadership divisions in making his announcement, arguing that personality questions were obscuring substantive issues. He remained a member of the legislature until the 1981 election.

==Post-political career==
After his retirement from politics, Cherniack became chair of Manitoba Hydro, and served as a member of the Security Intelligence Review Committee overseeing the Canadian Security Intelligence Service from 1984 to 1992. Accordingly, he was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on November 30, 1984, to enable him access to information restricted under the &quot;Official Secrets Act&quot;.

Cherniack has also served as national vice-president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. He retired from his legal practice in 2000.

In 1963, his son Howard Cherniack was part of the group that founded the Reformed Druids of North America.

In the 1999 provincial election, his son Lawrie Cherniack ran for the NDP in Fort Garry against Joy Smith, and lost by only 30 votes.

In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

Cherniack was a member of both the Order of Canada and the Order of Manitoba.

He turned 100 in January 2017 and died on March 30, 2018, at the age of 101.

<doc id="316107" wikidata="Q331762" url="?curid=316107" title="Absaroka Range">
<text>The Absaroka Range is a sub-range of the Rocky Mountains in the United States. The range stretches about across the Montana–Wyoming border, and at its widest, forming the eastern boundary of Yellowstone National Park along Paradise Valley, and the western side of the Bighorn Basin. The range borders the Beartooth Mountains to the north and the Wind River Range to the south. The northern edge of the range rests along I-90 and Livingston, Montana. The highest peak in the range is Francs Peak, located in Wyoming at . There are 46 other peaks over .

==Geography==
The range is drained by the Yellowstone River and various tributaries, including the Bighorn River.

Most of the range lies within protected lands including Yellowstone Park, the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, North Absaroka Wilderness, Teton Wilderness, and Washakie Wilderness, spanning the Bridger-Teton National Forest, Custer National Forest, Gallatin National Forest, and Shoshone National Forest.

U.S. Highway 212 from Billings, Montana to Yellowstone climbs over Beartooth Pass in the neighboring Beartooth Mountains before winding through the Absarokas to the northeast gate of Yellowstone National Park. It is only open during the summer. U.S Route 14/16/20 follows the Shoshone River from Cody through the range to the eastern gate of the park.

==Climate==

==History==
The range is named after the Absaroka Native People. The name is derived from the Hidatsa name for the Crow people; it means &quot;children of the large-beaked bird.&quot; (In contrast, the Crow name, &quot;Awaxaawe Báaxxioo&quot;, means &quot;Pointed Mountains [Like Sand Castles].&quot;)

John Colter, who may have been the first white person to visit the area, probably traveled along the foot of the Absarokas in 1807 during his reconnaissance of the Yellowstone region. Early explorers also included Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Nathaniel P. Langford, who climbed the summit of Colter Peak in 1870.

The proposed state of Absaroka shared the same age with the mountain range. The USS &quot;Absaroka&quot; was named after this mountain range.

==Geology==
Geologically, the section of the range in Wyoming consists of volcanic breccia, whereas there is a transition to granite and gneiss bedrock further north of the state line.

===Absaroka Volcanic Province===
Igneous rocks of the Absaroka Volcanic Province cover an area of approximately in southwestern Montana and northwestern Wyoming, including roughly one third of Yellowstone National Park. These extrusive rocks were erupted during the Eocene Epoch of the Paleogene Period. Radiometric dating has shown that eruptive activity lasted from about . The eroded remnants of many large stratovolcanoes are found in the area. The dissection of these long extinct volcanoes by erosion allows geologists to see volcanic structures that are impossible to see in active volcanoes. Many terms now widely used in volcanology originated in nineteenth century field studies of these ancient volcanoes.

<doc id="316108" wikidata="Q1546121" url="?curid=316108" title="Greville Janner">
<text>Greville Ewan Janner, Baron Janner of Braunstone, (11 July 1928 – 19 December 2015) was a British politician, barrister and writer. He became a Labour Party Member of Parliament for Leicester in the 1970 general election as a last-minute candidate, succeeding his father. He was an MP until 1997, and then elevated to the House of Lords. Never a frontbencher, Janner was particularly known for his work on Select Committees; he chaired the Select Committee on Employment for a time. He was associated with a number of Jewish organisations including the Board of Deputies of British Jews, of which he was chairman from 1978 to 1984, and was later prominent in the field of education about the Holocaust.

Beginning in 1991, several allegations of child sexual abuse were made against Janner. Criminal proceedings brought in 2015 were halted by his death in December of that year; claims made against his estate were all dropped by May 2017, with Janner&#x27;s family calling the claimants &quot;false accusers&quot; afraid of cross-examination. Carl Beech, whose accusations had led to the Operation Midland police investigation (and who was himself found to be a child sex offender), was convicted for false accusation of Janner and others and jailed for 18 years; the Janner family subsequently criticized both the Labour politician Tom Watson for his part in the affair, and the system &quot;where people are believed instantly before the evidence is examined&quot;. An enquiry into the handling of the case by officials began in October 2020. In October 2021, the enquiry concluded that the police &quot;appeared reluctant to fully investigate&quot; the allegations against Janner, and that the process had been marred by a &quot;series of failings&quot;.

== Early life ==

Janner was born in Cardiff, Wales, to Lithuanian Jewish (Litvak) parents, the son of Barnett Janner and Elsie Sybil, née Cohen. Janner and Ruth, his sister (later Lady Morris of Kenwood), were evacuated to Canada at the age of 11, because their parents anticipated a Nazi invasion of Britain. While in Canada, living with family friends, he attended Bishop&#x27;s College School, Lennoxville, Quebec. Janner returned to Britain in 1942 and attended St Paul&#x27;s School, London.

At the age of 18, he served in occupied Germany working for the War Crimes Investigation Unit of the British Army of the Rhine for 18 months. Janner investigated cases of British airmen who were shot at Stalag Luft III, the prisoner of war camp. At weekends, he worked with Holocaust survivors at Bergen-Belsen. The army unit was closed in 1948 to Janner&#x27;s dismay.

Later, Janner read Law at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society, in 1952, and chairman of the university Labour Club. He became the international secretary of the National Association of Labour Students and president of Trinity Hall Athletic Club. Janner was able to attend Harvard Law School through both the Fulbright and Smith-Mundt Act awards.

After training, via a Harmsworth Scholarship at Middle Temple, he became a barrister in 1954 and was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) in 1971.

== Public career ==

=== House of Commons and Jewish causes ===
Having unsuccessfully fought Wimbledon in the 1955 General Election, Janner represented Leicester North West from the 1970 general election until February 1974, succeeding his father, Sir Barnett Janner, a former Chairman of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain. His father announced his retirement from the Commons two days before candidate nominations closed in 1970, and his son was quickly chosen in his place. Posters imploring electors to &quot;Vote Janner&quot; had already been printed, and thus did not need to be scrapped.

The younger Janner retained the reformed Leicester West from 1974 until his retirement at the 1997 general election. Janner chaired the Select Committee on Employment from 1994 to 1996. He lost this position because Conservative members of the committee acted against him. A potential conflict of interest existed as he was an advisor to firms the committee might investigate. He was succeeded in Leicester West by Patricia Hewitt.

Janner was president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the main representative body of the British Jewish community, from 1978 to 1984, and was a prominent campaigner in the efforts to gain reparations for victims of the Holocaust. In parliament, and outside, he was involved in campaigning for the War Crimes Act 1991, lobbying the Thatcher government to allow legislation to bring those responsible for Nazi atrocities (and now resident in Britain) to justice. He was also a vice-president of the World Jewish Congress until 2009 and of the Jewish Leadership Council until 2015. He was president of the National Council for Soviet Jewry (1979–85) and the Commonwealth Jewish Council.

In 1988 he co-founded the Holocaust Educational Trust with Merlyn Rees, a body which successfully persuaded the British government to add teaching about the Holocaust to the National Curriculum in 1988. Janner stood down from the role in 2012. The Lord Janner Scholarship provides funding for ten schools to take part in the Trust&#x27;s educational programmes each year.

Janner sought to foster good relations between different faiths and religions and wrote about this issue in his book &quot;One Hand Alone Cannot Clap&quot;. He co-founded (along with Prince Hassan of Jordan) the Coexistence Trust, a charity to combat Islamophobia and antisemitism.

=== House of Lords ===
Janner was created a life peer as Baron Janner of Braunstone, of Leicester in the County of Leicestershire in 1997. He was President and an Officer of the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Anti-Semitism. Janner was associated with the Labour Friends of Israel and in 2002 backed Stephen Byers to be chairman.

In 2006, Janner was struck by Lord Bramall, a former head of the Armed Forces, during a heated row over the Middle East. In the incident, which occurred during the 2006 Lebanon War, the two men had disagreed in the House of Lords chamber after Bramall had made comments Janner considered too critical of Israel. Janner was hit in one of the rooms close to the chamber. Janner later sought the advice of fellow peers about how and whether to make a formal complaint against Lord Bramall, before deciding to accept an apology.

Janner continued to attend the House of Lords until December 2013. He was on leave of absence from the House of Lords from 13 October 2014.

=== Other ===
Janner wrote a number of books on public speaking and business communication, including &quot;On Presentation&quot;. In addition, he wrote extensively under the pen-name Ewan Mitchell. He was a former member of The Magic Circle and the International Brotherhood of Magicians.

== Personal life ==
In 1955, Janner married Myra Louise Sheink, who was originally from Australia and the niece of Sir Israel Brodie, the former Chief Rabbi of Great Britain and the Commonwealth. The couple had three children: two daughters and a son. Myra Sheink died in 1996.

Lord Janner&#x27;s younger daughter is Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, who was appointed Senior Rabbi to Reform Judaism in 2011. She is married to a brother of the Israeli writer Amos Oz. Marion Janner, his other daughter, was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to mental health in 2010. Daniel Janner, his son, is a barrister and KC.

=== Illness and death ===
In 2009, Janner was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Its advancing severity meant that by 2015 he required round-the-clock care for his dementia. At a court hearing in August 2015, a medical specialist acting as a witness for the defence said that Janner was experiencing the early stages of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Janner died on 19 December 2015 from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, aged 87.

== Child sexual abuse allegations ==
Over the years, starting in 1991, specific allegations of sex abuse of children by Janner in the past—dating ultimately from at least 1955—were made to authorities. This did not lead to any official action, beyond Janner being questioned once, from the first allegations until 2015. After it was decided in 2015 that he should have been prosecuted earlier, the accusations were to be investigated in a &quot;trial of the facts&quot; in April 2016—Janner was deemed to be too ill for a criminal trial—but he died before this could happen, though his actions were included in a large inquiry into historical sex abuse.

=== Statements to Parliament in December 1991 ===
In 1991, the director of a children&#x27;s home in Leicestershire, Frank Beck, was convicted of child abuse over 13 years to 1986 and sentenced to five life terms. During the trial, Beck accused Janner of having abused a child, and a witness said that while he was in care Janner had abused him. Janner could not say that Beck was lying until after the trial, because it would have been in contempt of court.

Janner received cross-party support in the House of Commons after Beck&#x27;s conviction. In a Commons statement, delivered on 2 December, he said there was &quot;not a shred of truth&quot; in the claims which had been made against him. In a debate on 3 December on the issue of contempt of court and third-parties being potentially defamed in court cases—essentially, according to another MP, dealing with the accusations against &quot;an honoured colleague in the House&quot;—Janner said he had received a letter from a former cellmate of Beck&#x27;s, who had written that Beck was intent on implicating Janner as being responsible for criminal acts to &quot;take the light off him [Beck]&quot;. Janner said that he had previously refused to provide Beck with references, and that Beck had &quot;enlisted&quot; the witness, Paul Winston, in an attempt to &quot;frame&quot; Janner.

=== Earlier police investigations and CPS decisions ===
Janner was interviewed by the police in 1991, when the prosecution case against Beck was being prepared. In the first of three previous investigations which did not lead to a prosecution, no charges were brought against the MP because of &quot;insufficient evidence&quot;, although the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in 2015 that Janner should have been tried. The 1991 interview was the only time Janner was interviewed by the police. Accompanied by his solicitor, Janner has been reported as having replied &quot;no comment&quot; to the questions put to him. Janner and his solicitor, Sir David Napley, were in contact with the barrister George Carman QC in anticipation of a defence brief needing to be prepared if Janner was put on trial. Carman and Napley were surprised no charges were brought against him because of the weight of evidence, according to Dominic Carman, the barrister&#x27;s son.

Further police investigations took place in 2002 and 2006; documents relating to Janner were not passed to the Crown Prosecution Service after the 2002 investigation. The former Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Lord Macdonald, told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in April 2015 that the penultimate CPS decision not to prosecute Janner in 2007 was actually made by officials in Leicestershire who did not contact head office in London about the case.

In September 2014, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Mike Creedon, currently the Chief Constable of Derbyshire Constabulary, claimed that in 1989, while he was serving as a Detective Sergeant, senior police chiefs severely limited his enquiries into paedophilia allegations against Janner, despite &quot;credible evidence&quot; which warranted further investigation.

=== Fourth investigation and original CPS decision ===
In 2013 and early 2014, Leicestershire Police searched Janner&#x27;s home in north London and his offices in the House of Lords in connection with an enquiry linked to historical child abuse allegations. Janner insisted on his innocence. A file of evidence against Janner was sent to the CPS, but he was not interviewed by the police.

On 16 April 2015, the CPS issued a statement indicating that they would not charge Janner owing to his poor health. During Leicestershire Police&#x27;s Operation Enamel more than 20 men were interviewed who claimed Janner had abused them before they were adults. The CPS stated that the case met their evidential test for prosecution and they would have otherwise have prosecuted on 22 counts of indecent assaults and buggery, against nine persons which are alleged to have occurred between 1969 and 1988.

They decided that it failed the public interest test, as Janner was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2009 and the associated dementia had progressed to a point where he could not engage with the court process, and his evidence could not be relied upon. This meant that a court case could not proceed. Four specialist medical practitioners, two acting for the prosecution and police and two for the defence, had confirmed the severity of Janner&#x27;s dementia. Just over a week later, it emerged that although the four doctors agreed Janner had severe dementia they were not unanimous on the six points listed in the CPS statement. Only one was asked if Janner could be faking the condition, a suggestion which was categorically dismissed.
However, witnesses have testified that Janner was not only lucid in 2013 but was also seen driving his car.
Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, stated that the earlier decisions made by police and the CPS not to prosecute were wrong. A retired High Court judge, Sir Richard Henriques, was appointed to carry out an independent investigation of all matters involving the CPS which related to the case. Henriques&#x27; report was published in January 2016 (see below).

Saunders told the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; a week later: &quot;My job is not to be populist. It&#x27;s not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It&#x27;s about making the right decisions.&quot; On 16 April 2015, a few hours after the CPS decision, the Labour Party suspended Janner from membership of the party.

&quot;Lord Janner is a man of great integrity and high repute with a long and unblemished record of public service&quot;, his family said in a statement issued at the time of the CPS decision in April 2015. &quot;He is entirely innocent of any wrongdoing. As the Crown Prosecution Service indicated today, this decision [not to prosecute] does not mean or imply that any of the allegations that have been made are established or that Lord Janner is guilty of any offence.&quot;

=== Initial responses ===
After the announcement, Leicestershire Police, blamed in the CPS statement for past failures in the investigations into Janner&#x27;s activities, said it was considering a request for a judicial review into the CPS decision. Solicitors representing alleged victims said that actions for damages against the peer were likely.

Lord Macdonald, the former DPP, told the &quot;Today&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4 on 18 April that a decision over whether to prosecute Janner should have been taken in court by a judge, rather than by the CPS, to remove any doubt that the most recent investigation had been carried out properly. The Exaro website revealed on the same day that Janner was being investigated as part of Operation Midland, the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s investigation into the Westminster paedophile ring.

It emerged that during April, Janner had written to the House of Lords clerks indicating that he did not wish to cease being an active peer. John Mann, who was then campaigning to retain his Bassetlaw seat for Labour during the 2015 general election, told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that all the documents relating to the upper chamber&#x27;s contact with Janner should be made public. &quot;I don&#x27;t see how you can sign a document relating to membership of the House of Lords if you have dementia&quot;, he said.

A cross-party letter co-ordinated by Simon Danczuk, a Labour politician, signed by 11 politicians from 7 parties, was published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 22 April. The signatories asserted: &quot;As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.&quot; The legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, accused the politicians of not understanding the legal system. Critical of other decisions Saunders has made as DPP, he nevertheless agreed with her judgement in the Janner case and said she should &quot;be commended for defending her Janner decision in unprecedented detail&quot;.

=== Subsequent developments ===
On 29 April 2015, Dame Lowell Goddard, the New Zealand judge appointed to head the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, announced that she would also investigate the Janner case. Goddard would have access to CPS files and the ability to interview Janner&#x27;s alleged victims. Goddard was to review the medical evidence concerning Janner&#x27;s fitness to stand trial, with the possibility that she might commission her own assessment, and question Janner if he had been declared medically fit.

In the new parliament elected on 7 May 2015, 78 MPs supported a reversal of the DPP (Alison Saunders&#x27;) decision and for the case to go to court in a &quot;trial of the facts&quot;. This was the eventual ruling at the Old Bailey in December 2015, but Janner died soon afterwards, several months before the trial of the facts was scheduled to take place.

It emerged on 15 May 2015 that the CPS decision not to charge Lord Janner was being reviewed under the CPS Victims&#x27; Right to Review scheme by an external senior QC previously uninvolved in the case.

=== Overturning of the CPS decision ===
On 29 June 2015, it was reported the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions not to prosecute Janner had been overturned by David Perry, the QC appointed to make a review of the CPS decision in April. A judge was now to decide if Janner was fit to stand a criminal trial. The case was considered at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court on 7 August; the court ruled that Janner must attend the preliminary hearing, if only briefly. Janner was in court for less than a minute on 14 August to identify himself. The next hearing was at the Old Bailey on 1 September; Janner was not required to appear.

On 7 December 2015, it was ruled at the Old Bailey that Janner was unfit to stand trial. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Openshaw, summarised his decision based on the evidence from four medical experts: &quot;The defendant has advanced and disabling dementia that has deteriorated and is irreversible, and accordingly I find that he is unfit to plead.&quot; A trial of the facts was scheduled to take place in April 2016, at which a jury would have heard the evidence and come to a conclusion about Janner&#x27;s alleged abuse, but would not have been able to decide Janner&#x27;s innocence or guilt.

=== Posthumous developments ===

Janner died on 19 December 2015, and criminal proceedings against him ended with his death. Old Bailey judge Mr Justice Openshaw said in January 2016: &quot;There is nothing more to be said. That&#x27;s the end of the proceedings, that the defendant is dead&quot;. Liz Dux, a solicitor for six of Janner&#x27;s alleged abuse victims, said that claims against the estate would be made in the civil courts. However, in March 2017, three of the claimants dropped their civil suits, followed by six more in May, signalling an end to all civil actions against his estate.

In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, the Janner family declared, &quot;Our father&#x27;s reputation as a man who devoted his life to good has been restored.&quot; His son, Daniel Janner, stated, &quot;These false accusers, having dropped their claim because they risk being cross-examined, can no longer form the basis of this strand. Accordingly, the existence of this strand undermines the integrity of the important work of the inquiry.&quot;

On 15 January 2016, further allegations of abuse were made by twelve former residents of children&#x27;s homes; Janner had regularly visited homes in Leicestershire in the 1970s and 1980s. The BBC had traced and interviewed dozens of men and women who lived at Leicestershire children&#x27;s homes in that period. It had also &quot;spoken to council officials, social workers, police officers and journalists involved&quot; in the Frank Beck investigation. Solicitors were representing at least 20 men and one woman, including the 12 residents of children&#x27;s homes, who say Janner had abused them. Police said they have information from 25 alleged victims.

The report of the retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques concerning the earlier investigations of allegations made against Janner was published in January 2016. The CPS and Leicestershire police were again criticised in his independent report, and he concluded that there had been sufficient evidence to make probable a successful prosecution of Janner in 1991, 2002 and 2007.

In 1991, the police had not checked whether Janner had shared a hotel room with a 14-year-old boy (known as &quot;Complainant 1&quot;), and had made only &quot;extremely limited&quot; checks at the children&#x27;s home where he lived. It was found two decades later that the child had attended a wedding with the Janner family, and that film footage existed of his presence. The 2002 investigation was connected with allegations of historic abuse at a children&#x27;s home, in which a former resident made accusations against Janner: &quot;The failure to forward Complainant 2&#x27;s statement to the CPS for charging advice is remarkable&quot;, Henriques wrote. It was suggested that Leicestershire police should have passed the file about the 2002 investigation on to the CPS (as the CPS had admitted), and Henriques advocated this inaction be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

The Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse announced on 16 November 2016 that it was delaying its hearings into Janner due to a &quot;significant overlap&quot; between its investigation and the criminal proceedings, which could cause prejudice in court.

In 2019, Daniel Janner founded the group Falsely Accused Individuals for Reform, which aims to prevent the names of people accused of sexual offences from being made public until/unless they are charged. That July, Carl Beech, whose accusations had fuelled the Operation Midland police investigation, was convicted of falsely accusing Janner and others of sexual abuse and murder. Daniel Janner appeared in the witness box as Beech was being sentenced and said of his father, &quot;He died an innocent man. He was a force for good and justice.&quot; Beech was jailed for 18 years.
Janner was critical of the role in the affair of Tom Watson, saying &quot;Tom Watson should resign. He appointed himself Britain&#x27;s chief paedo-finder general and created a moral panic. His motive was personal political advancement riding on a bandwagon of public frenzy which he had whipped up. He should hang his head in shame. For him to take the moral high ground in the Labour Party against antisemitism is completely hypocritical.&quot;

Janner&#x27;s daughter, Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, said &quot;We have a system where people are believed instantly before the evidence is examined instead of being listened to compassionately and the allegations properly investigated. People were able to accuse (my father) without a shred of evidence and were believed straight away.&quot; Janner-Klausner was criticised by Migdal Emunah, a charity which supports victims of sexual abuse in the Jewish community, for using her position as a senior rabbi to discredit the allegations against her father.

<text>Seymour Myron Hersh (born April 8, 1937) is an American investigative journalist and political writer. He gained recognition in 1969 for exposing the My Lai massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War, for which he received the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. During the 1970s, Hersh covered the Watergate scandal for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, also reporting on the secret U.S. bombing of Cambodia and the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s (CIA) program of domestic spying. In 2004, he detailed the U.S. military&#x27;s torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Hersh has won five George Polk Awards, and two National Magazine Awards. He is the author of 11 books, including &quot;The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House&quot; (1983), an account of the career of Henry Kissinger which won the National Book Critics Circle Award.

In 2013, Hersh&#x27;s reporting alleged that Syrian rebel forces, rather than the government, had attacked civilians with sarin gas at Ghouta during the Syrian Civil War, and in 2015, he presented an alternative account of the U.S. special forces raid in Pakistan which killed Osama bin Laden, both times attracting controversy and criticism. In 2023, Hersh alleged that the U.S. and Norway had sabotaged the Nord Stream pipelines, again stirring controversy. He is known for his use of anonymous sources, for which his later stories in particular have been criticized.

== Early life and education ==
Hersh was born in Chicago, Illinois, on April 8, 1937, to Isador and Dorothy Hersh (née Margolis), Yiddish-speaking Jews who had immigrated to the U.S. in the 1920s from Lithuania and Poland, respectively. Isador&#x27;s original surname was Hershowitz, which he had changed upon becoming a citizen in 1930. As a teenager, Seymour helped run the family&#x27;s dry cleaning shop on the South Side. Hersh graduated from Hyde Park High School in 1954, then attended the University of Illinois Chicago and later the University of Chicago, where he graduated with a history degree in 1958. He worked as a Xerox salesman before being admitted to the University of Chicago Law School in 1959, but was expelled during his first year due to poor grades.

== Newspaper career ==

After briefly working at a Walgreens drug store, Hersh began his career in 1959 with a seven-month stint at the City News Bureau of Chicago, first as a copyboy and later as a crime reporter. In 1960, he enlisted as an Army reservist, and spent three months in basic training at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. After returning to Chicago, in 1961 Hersh launched the &quot;Evergreen Dispatch&quot;, a short-lived weekly newspaper for the suburb of Evergreen Park. He moved to Pierre, South Dakota, in 1962 to work as a correspondent for United Press International (UPI), reporting on the state legislature and writing a series of articles on the Oglala Sioux.

In 1963, Hersh moved back to Chicago to work for the Associated Press (AP), and in 1965 he was transferred to its Washington, D.C., bureau to report on the Pentagon. While in Washington, he befriended famed investigative journalist I. F. Stone, whose muckraking newsletter &quot;I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot; served as an inspiration. Hersh began to develop his investigative methods, often walking out of regimented press briefings at the Pentagon to interview high-ranking officers in their lunch halls. In 1966, Hersh reported on the intensifying U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, writing series of articles on draft reform, the shortage of qualified pilots, and on the U.S. bombing of civilian targets in North Vietnam, revealed by &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent Harrison Salisbury.

In 1967, Hersh became part of the AP&#x27;s first special investigative unit. After his editors diminished a piece he wrote on the U.S.&#x27;s secretive chemical and biological weapons programs, he quit and became a freelancer. Hersh wrote six articles in national magazines in 1967 (two for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, two for &quot;Ramparts&quot;, and two for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;) in which he detailed the government&#x27;s growing stockpiles of the weapons and its co-operation with universities and corporations, as well as the secret adoption of a first-use policy. The research formed the basis for his first book, &quot;Chemical and Biological Warfare: America&#x27;s Hidden Arsenal&quot; (1968), and the topic was highlighted that year by the Dugway sheep incident, in which an aerial test of VX nerve agent at the U.S. Army&#x27;s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah inadvertently killed more than 6,000 sheep owned by local ranchers. The event and Hersh&#x27;s reporting led to public hearings and international pressure, contributing to the Nixon administration&#x27;s decision to end the U.S. biological weapons program in 1969.

In the first three months of 1968, Hersh served as the press secretary for anti–Vietnam War candidate Senator Eugene McCarthy in his campaign in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries. After resigning before the Wisconsin primary, he returned to journalism as a freelance reporter on Vietnam.

=== My Lai massacre ===
In 1969, Hersh reported on the My Lai massacre, the murder of between 347 and 504 unarmed Vietnamese civilians (almost all women, children, and elderly men) by U.S. soldiers in a village on March 16, 1968. The initial information about the massacre was provided by whistleblower Ronald Ridenhour, who investigated while serving as a soldier in the United States 11th Infantry Brigade in Vietnam.

On October 22, 1969, Hersh received a tip from Geoffrey Cowan, a columnist for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; with a military source, about a soldier being held at Fort Benning in Georgia for a court-martial for allegedly killing 75 civilians in South Vietnam. After speaking with a Pentagon contact and Fort Benning&#x27;s public relations office, Hersh found an AP story from September 7 that identified the soldier as Lieutenant William Calley. He next found Calley&#x27;s lawyer, George W. Latimer, who met with him in Salt Lake City, Utah, and showed him a document which revealed Calley was charged with killing 109 people. Hersh traveled to Fort Benning on November 11, where he quickly gained the confidence of Calley&#x27;s roommates and eventually Calley himself, whom he interviewed that night. Hersh&#x27;s first article on the massacre, a cautious and conservative piece which was approved with Latimer, was initially rejected by &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Look&quot; magazines. Hersh next approached the anti-war Dispatch News Service run by his friend David Obst, which sold the story to 35 national papers. On November 13, the story appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, and &quot;Newsday&quot;, among others. Initial reaction was muted, with the press focusing on a massive anti-war demonstration in Washington on November 15.

Follow-up articles by other reporters revealed that the Army&#x27;s investigation had been prompted by a letter on March 29 from Ronald Ridenhour, a Vietnam veteran who had interviewed soldiers who knew of the killings. After traveling to California and visiting Ridenhour, who gave him their personal information, Hersh traveled across the country to interview the soldiers. This revealed that eyewitnesses had been told not to talk to anyone, and that the actual death count was in the hundreds. On November 20, Dispatch syndicated Hersh&#x27;s second article, which was internationally published. On the same day, photos of the massacre by Army photographer Ronald L. Haeberle were published in the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;, causing outrage among members of Congress and the public. The reporting was now being followed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Post&quot;, and was covered on the CBS and NBC national nightly news. Hersh next interviewed Paul Meadlo, a soldier who admitted that he had killed dozens of civilians on the orders of Calley. Meadlo&#x27;s mother told Hersh that she &quot;sent them a good boy and they made him a murderer&quot;. Hersh&#x27;s third article was syndicated by Dispatch on November 25, and that night an interview with Meadlo by Mike Wallace on the CBS News program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; was broadcast on national television. The White House acknowledged the massacre for the first time the next day, and the Army appointed General William R. Peers to head an official commission investigating it. Hersh proceeded to visit 50 witnesses over the next three months, 35 of whom agreed to talk. His fourth article, syndicated on December 2, revealed random killings of civilians in the days before the massacre; a fifth article was published weeks later. Ten pages of Haeberle&#x27;s photos were printed in &quot;Life&quot; magazine on December 5.

Hersh&#x27;s reporting garnered him national fame, and encouraged the growing opposition to the war in the U.S. However, he was also attacked by some in the press and government, who questioned his work and motivations. An op-ed column in the &quot;Times&quot; by James Reston asked: &quot;Whatever happened in the massacre, should it be reported by press, radio and television, since clearly reporting the murder of civilians by American soldiers helps the enemy, divides the people of this country, and damages the ideal of America in the world?&quot; South Carolina Republican Representative Albert Watson said, &quot;this is no time to cast aspersions on our fighting men, the President and ourselves for that matter, as some members of the national news media and a few demagogues are doing&quot;. The reveal of the massacre changed American media coverage of the war, which was restrained and had limited independence from official sources in its reporting before 1967; after the exposure of the My Lai massacre, major newspapers began reporting on other U.S. atrocities in Vietnam.

For his coverage, Hersh won the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting and numerous other awards, including his first George Polk Award. He later wrote in a note to Robert Loomis, the editor of his 1970 book-length account of the massacre, &quot;My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath&quot;:

On March 14, 1970, the Peers Commission submitted to the Army its secret report on the massacre, containing more than 20,000 pages of testimony from 400 witnesses. One of Hersh&#x27;s sources leaked the testimony to him over the course of a year; it revealed that at least 347 civilians were killed, over twice as many as the Army had publicly conceded. The leak formed the basis for two articles by Hersh for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in 1972, which alleged that officers had destroyed documents on the massacre, as well as his 1972 book &quot;Cover-Up: The Army&#x27;s Secret Investigation of the Massacre at My Lai 4&quot;.

=== &quot;The New York Times&quot; ===

In April 1972, Hersh was hired by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as an investigative journalist at the paper&#x27;s Washington bureau. After the June 17 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington and the emergence of the Watergate scandal, the &quot;Times&quot; sought to catch up with the reporting of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who broke several stories in 1972 linking the break-in to the Nixon campaign. Together with Walter Rugaber, Hersh produced extensive reporting for the &quot;Times&quot; on the unfolding scandal; a key article by him published on January 14, 1973, revealed that hush money payments were still being made to the burglars, which shifted the press&#x27;s focus from the break-in itself to its cover-up. During 1973, Hersh wrote more than 40 articles on Watergate, most printed on page one; his reveals included the FBI&#x27;s failure to investigate political operative Donald Segretti, despite knowing of his activities, and leaks from the grand jury testimonies of former Attorney General John Mitchell and burglar James McCord, the latter of which revealed that the Committee to Re-Elect the President had made the payments. John Dean, Nixon&#x27;s counsel, later said that while it had been the &quot;Post&quot; articles in 1972 that had encouraged prosecutors, &quot;the most devastating pieces that strike awfully close to home&quot; were Hersh&#x27;s in 1973 and 1974.

Hersh contributed to the revelations around Operation Menu, the secret U.S. bombing of neutral Cambodia in 1969–1970. On June 11, 1972, an article by Hersh alleged that General John D. Lavelle, who had recently been relieved as commander of the Air Force in Southeast Asia, was ousted because he had ordered repeated, unauthorized bombings of North Vietnam. The ensuing &quot;Lavelle affair&quot; led to Senate Armed Services Committee hearings in September 1972. After reading Hersh&#x27;s articles on the affair, Major Hal Knight, who had supervised radar crews in Vietnam, realized that the Senate &quot;was unaware of what had taken place while I was out there&quot;, and in early 1973 wrote a letter to the committee that confessed his role in the cover-up of Operation Menu, in which he recorded fake bombing coordinates and burned his orders. Hersh learned of Knight&#x27;s letter after exposing a different scandal on May 17, 1973, in which Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger had authorized wiretaps of employees of the National Security Council after early bombings of Cambodia were exposed in the &quot;Times&quot; in May 1969. Hersh interviewed Knight and detailed the cover-up of Menu in an article on July 15, 1973, one day before the start of Knight&#x27;s public testimony. On July 16, Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger admitted that the Air Force had flown 3,630 raids over Cambodia in 14 months, dropping more than 100,000 tons of bombs. Hersh continued to investigate who had ordered the cover-up; in a rare telephone interview, Kissinger stated Nixon had &quot;neither ordered nor was aware of any falsification&quot;. On July 31, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Earle Wheeler admitted that Nixon had ordered him to falsify records. Nixon&#x27;s impeachment on this basis was proposed that day by Representative Robert Drinan, and it was considered as an article alongside the Watergate cover-up during the House debate on Nixon&#x27;s articles of impeachment in July 1974.

In early 1974, Hersh planned to publish a story on &quot;Project Jennifer&quot; (later revealed to be codenamed Project Azorian), a covert CIA operation that partially recovered the sunken Soviet submarine &quot;K-129&quot; from the floor of the Pacific Ocean with a purpose-built vessel, the &quot;Glomar Explorer.&quot; The ship, which was falsely presented as a underwater mineral mining vessel, was built by a company owned by magnate Howard Hughes. After a discussion with CIA director William Colby, Hersh promised not to publish the story while the operation was still active, in order to avoid triggering a potential international incident. The &quot;Times&quot; eventually published Hersh&#x27;s article on March 19, 1975, with an added five-paragraph explanation of the publishing history and one-year delay.

On September 8, 1974, an article by Hersh revealed that the CIA, with the approval of Kissinger, had spent $8 million to influence unions, political parties, and media in Chile in order to destabilize the government of socialist Salvador Allende, who was overthrown in the September 11, 1973, coup d&#x27;état that brought to power a military dictatorship under General Augusto Pinochet. Hersh followed up the story over the next two months, with 27 articles in total.

On December 22, 1974, Hersh exposed Operation CHAOS, a massive CIA program of domestic wiretapping and infiltration of anti-war groups during the Nixon administration, which was conducted in direct violation of the agency&#x27;s charter. Hersh reported that dossiers had been compiled on at least 10,000 American citizens, including congressmen; the government eventually conceded the figure was closer to 300,000. He wrote 34 more articles on the story over the next months; they prompted the formation of the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee, which investigated covert CIA operations and led to reforms of the agency. Hersh&#x27;s exposure of CHAOS was the earliest reporting to reveal contents of the CIA&#x27;s &quot;Family Jewels&quot; list of its own illegal activities. Hersh soon felt &quot;double-crossed&quot; after learning of a January 16, 1975, meeting between the paper&#x27;s top editors (including executive editor A. M. Rosenthal) and President Gerald Ford, in which the president mentioned CIA political assassinations—a comment which he subsequently asked to be struck from the record; the editors later agreed not to tell Hersh about the disclosure. Hersh thereafter decided to move away from reporting on the CIA.

On May 25, 1975, Hersh revealed that the U.S. Navy was using submarines to collect intelligence inside the three-mile protected coastal zone of the Soviet Union in a spy program codenamed &quot;Holystone&quot;, which had continued for at least 15 years. It was later revealed that Dick Cheney, one of Ford&#x27;s top aides and later George W. Bush&#x27;s vice president, proposed that the FBI search the home of Hersh and his sources in order to halt his reporting on the subject.

In 1976, Hersh moved with his family to New York, where his wife was to attend medical school. He began working on larger projects; the first was a four-part investigation produced with Jeff Gerth, initially appearing on June 27, 1976, into the activities of Sidney Korshak, a lawyer and &quot;fixer&quot; for the Chicago Mafia, union leaders, and Hollywood. On July 24, 1977, the &quot;Times&quot; published the first entry in a three-part investigation by Hersh and Gerth into financial impropriety at Gulf and Western Industries, one of the country&#x27;s largest conglomerates; it was followed by two civil lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The &quot;Times&quot; management was ambivalent about Hersh&#x27;s new focus (he later stated that the paper &quot;wasn&#x27;t nearly as happy when we went after business wrongdoing as when we were kicking around some slob in government&quot;), and he left the job in 1979 to start writing a book on Henry Kissinger.

In 1981, an article by Hersh in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; described how former CIA agents Edwin Wilson and Frank Terpil had worked with Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, to illegally export explosives and train his troops for terrorism. Hersh reported that the CIA had given the pair tacit approval to oversee the sale of American technology. The story was followed up by Gerth at the &quot;Times&quot; through 1982, prompting reforms at the agency.

== Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s==

Hersh&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House&quot;, which involved four years of exhaustive work and more than 1,000 interviews, was a best-seller and won him the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction. The 698-page book contained 41 chapters, including 13 devoted to Kissinger&#x27;s role in Vietnam and the bombing of Cambodia; other topics included his role in the Chilean coup, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, domestic wiretapping, and the White House Plumbers, as well as Hersh&#x27;s criticism of his former &quot;Times&quot; colleagues, such as Max Frankel and James Reston, for their proximity to him. One much-discussed allegation was that Kissinger, originally an advisor to Nelson Rockefeller in the 1968 Republican Party presidential primaries before his defeat to Nixon, had offered Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey damaging material on Nixon before going to the Nixon campaign with secret information he had gathered from the Vietnam War&#x27;s Paris peace negotiations. The book also alleges that Kissinger alerted Nixon to President Johnson&#x27;s October 31, 1968, bombing halt 12 hours in advance, securing his position in the administration. The book is noted for its density of information and prosecutorial tone, and it has been credited with preventing Kissinger from returning to a government position during the Reagan administration.

While writing the book, Hersh revisited his previous reporting on Edward M. Korry, the U.S. ambassador to Chile from 1967 to 1971. In 1974, Hersh had reported in the &quot;Times&quot; that Korry had known of the CIA&#x27;s efforts to foment a coup. Korry, who had reacted to the claim with furious denial, demanded a front-page retraction in exchange for documents Hersh wanted for his book. The retraction, which &quot;Time&quot; called the &quot;longest correction ever published&quot;, appeared on February 9, 1981. Peter Kornbluh, Chile expert at the National Security Archive, later judged based on declassified documents that Korry was unaware of CIA involvement. Also in the book was the claim that former Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai had been paid $20,000 per year by the CIA during the Johnson and Nixon administrations. Desai filed a $50 million libel lawsuit against Hersh; when it went to trial in 1989, Desai, then 93, was too ill to attend, but Kissinger appeared and testified that Desai had not worked in any capacity for the CIA. A Chicago jury ruled in favor of Hersh, finding it had not been proved that Hersh had intended to write falsehoods or that he had shown reckless disregard for the truth, either of which must be proven in a libel suit.

In August 1983, a 17,500-word article by Hersh in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine alleged that former President Gerald Ford, whom he interviewed in the story, had struck a secret deal prior to Nixon&#x27;s resignation, brokered by Nixon&#x27;s chief of staff General Alexander Haig, which gave him the presidency in exchange for his subsequent pardon of Nixon. Hersh worked on and narrated the 1985 PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary &quot;Buying the Bomb&quot;, which reported on a Pakistani businessman who had attempted to smuggle krytron devices which could be used as nuclear bomb triggers out of the U.S. On June 12, 1986, an article by Hersh in the &quot;Times&quot; revealed that U.S.-backed dictator of Panama Manuel Noriega was a key figure in weapons and narcotics trafficking. The article was the first in a &quot;political landslide&quot; of allegations against Noriega; in 1989, the U.S. invaded Panama and captured him, taking him to the U.S. to stand trial.

Hersh spent much of the decade writing two critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful books. In his 1986 title &quot;The Target Is Destroyed&quot;, Hersh examined the 1983 shootdown of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union. He reported that the U.S. Air Force knew almost immediately that the Soviets believed that they had shot down a military plane, and that the U.S. misrepresented the situation to portray the Soviets as deliberate murderers of civilians. In &quot;The Samson Option&quot; (1991), Hersh chronicled the history of Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapon program, arguing that a nuclear capability was sought from the state&#x27;s founding, and that it was achieved under a U.S. policy of feigned ignorance and indirect assistance. Hersh also wrote that Israel received aid from the U.S. in the 1973 Yom Kippur War through &quot;nuclear blackmail&quot; (Israel&#x27;s threat to use the weapons against its Arab enemies). Another major allegation was that the intelligence passed to Israel by convicted American spy Jonathan Pollard had been shared with the Soviet Union by former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who denied the charge. Another allegation was that British media magnate Robert Maxwell was an informant for Mossad, Israel&#x27;s national intelligence agency; Maxwell filed a defamation lawsuit against Hersh, but died in a drowning incident two weeks after the book was published.

Hersh&#x27;s 1997 best-seller &quot;The Dark Side of Camelot&quot;, about the political career of John F. Kennedy, was controversial and heavily criticized. Shortly before publication, it emerged in the press that Hersh had removed claims at the last minute which were based on forged documents provided to him by fraudster Lex Cusack, including a fake hush money contract between Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. An article about the controversy in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said: &quot;The strange and twisted saga of the JFK file is part cautionary tale, part slapstick farce, a story of deception and self-delusion in the service of commerce and journalism&quot;. Hersh and a one-time co-author had received a $800,000 advance for the project. Other aspects of the book also came under criticism, including its prying into Kennedy&#x27;s alleged sexual escapades based on interviews with his Secret Service guards, and its claim that Kennedy used Judith Exner as a courier to deliver cash to mobster Sam Giancana, made by a source who later recanted it before the Assassination Records Review Board.

In 1998, Hersh published &quot;Against All Enemies: Gulf War Syndrome: The War Between America&#x27;s Ailing Veterans and Their Government&quot;, about Gulf War syndrome. He estimated that 15 percent of returning American troops were afflicted with the chronic and multi-symptomatic disorder, and challenged the government claim that they were suffering from war fatigue, as opposed to the effects of a chemical or biological weapon. He suggested the smoke from the destruction of a weapon depot that stored nerve gas at Khamisiyah in Iraq, to which more than 100,000 soldiers were exposed, as a possible cause.

== Later investigations ==

Starting in 1993, Hersh became a regular contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, edited by Tina Brown until 1998 and David Remnick thereafter. A piece by him in 1993 alleged that Pakistan had developed nuclear weapons with the consent of the Reagan and Bush administrations, using restricted, high-tech materials purchased in the U.S. In May 2000, a 25,000-word article by Hersh titled &quot;Overwhelming Force&quot;, the longest piece in the magazine since 1993, detailed the Battle of Rumaila, an alleged massacre of retreating and surrendering Iraqi troops by soldiers under General Barry McCaffrey on the &quot;Highway of Death&quot; in the final days of the 1990–1991 Gulf War. He had received tips on the incident, which had been investigated and dismissed by the U.S. Army, from other officers while investigating McCaffrey&#x27;s role in the Colombian drug war. Hersh performed six months of research for the article, and interviewed 300 people, including soldiers who had witnessed the killings; he alleged that McCaffrey had deceived his superiors and disregarded cease-fire orders. In July 2001, the magazine published Hersh&#x27;s investigation of Mobil&#x27;s illegal multibillion-dollar oil swap deal between Kazakhstan and Iran in the 1990s.

Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Hersh turned his focus to U.S. policy in the Middle East and the Bush administration&#x27;s &quot;war on terror&quot;. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, he reported on U.S. intelligence failures surrounding 9/11; on the corruption of the Saudi royal family and its alleged financial support for Osama bin Laden; and on the potential instability of the Pakistani nuclear arsenal, including an article alleging that the Pentagon was planning a covert operation inside Pakistan to disarm the weapons. President Bush told Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf that Hersh was &quot;a liar&quot;. During the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, Hersh reported that a Predator drone had followed a convoy carrying Taliban leader Mullah Omar, but that delayed approval for a missile strike had allowed him to escape; that a failed Army Delta Force raid on Omar&#x27;s compound in Kandahar had led to an escape in which 12 soldiers were injured; and that a U.S.-backed airlift of Pakistani officers from Kunduz in Afghanistan had inadvertently carried Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters. Hersh later reported on the government&#x27;s flawed prosecution of Zacarias Moussaoui, on the U.S.&#x27;s aggressive assassination efforts against al-Qaeda members, and on business conflicts of interest held by Richard Perle, chairman of the Pentagon&#x27;s advisory Defense Policy Board, which led to his resignation.

=== Iraq and Abu Ghraib===

Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Hersh disputed the Bush administration&#x27;s erroneous claims about Saddam Hussein&#x27;s alleged stockpile of weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorism, which had been used to justify the invasion. He reported that the claim that Iraq had received nuclear materials from Niger was based on forged documents, that the Pentagon&#x27;s Office of Special Plans had provided dubious intelligence to the White House on Iraq&#x27;s weapons capacity, and that the Bush administration had pressured the intelligence community to violate its &quot;stovepiping&quot; rule, which allowed only vetted and confirmed information to rise up the chain of command.

On April 30, 2004, Hersh published the first of three articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; which detailed the U.S. military&#x27;s torture and abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. The story, titled &quot;Torture at Abu Ghraib&quot;, was accompanied by a now-infamous photo of an Iraqi prisoner standing on a box and wearing a black pointed hood, his hands spread out and attached to electrodes. A short piece with the photo and others had appeared two days earlier on the CBS News program &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;, in anticipation of Hersh&#x27;s article. He described these photos:

Hersh had obtained a secret 53-page report from an internal Army investigation headed by General Antonio Taguba, which had been submitted on March 3. It detailed more of the abuses, including pouring cold water and liquid from broken chemical lights on naked detainees, beatings with a broom stick and a chair, threatening males with rape, allowing guards to stitch wounds from a beating, sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and a broom stick, and using military dogs to intimidate. The article also alleged that military intelligence teams, which included CIA officers and &quot;interrogation specialists&quot; from private contractors, had directed the abuse at the prison. In two articles in May 2004, &quot;Chain of Command&quot; and &quot;The Gray Zone&quot;, Hersh alleged that the abuse stemmed from a top-secret special access program (SAP) authorized by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld during the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, which provided blanket approval for killings, kidnappings, and interrogations (at Guantanamo Bay and CIA black sites) of &quot;high-value&quot; targets. He alleged that the SAP was extended to Iraq&#x27;s military prisons in 2003 to gather intelligence on the growing insurgency, with Rumsfeld and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone also extending its methods of physical coercion and sexual humiliation, under the name &quot;Copper Green&quot;.

In a rare statement responding directly to the allegations, Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said that they were &quot;outlandish, conspiratorial, and filled with error and anonymous conjecture&quot;, and that they reflected &quot;the fevered insights of those with little, if any, connection to the activities in the Department of Defense&quot;; he added that: &quot;With these false claims, the Magazine and the reporter have made themselves part of the story.&quot; As the scandal grew and calls for Rumsfeld to resign mounted, he privately offered to step down, which Bush rejected. Later stories by other reporters revealed the Torture Memos, in which the Department of Justice had advised the Pentagon and the CIA on the legality of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;. As after Hersh&#x27;s reporting on the My Lai massacre, he garnered national and international attention and won multiple awards, including his fifth George Polk Award. A book compiling and building upon his post-9/11 reporting for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; titled &quot;Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib&quot;, was published later in 2004.

In July 2005, an article by Hersh alleged that the U.S. had covertly intervened in favor of Ayad Allawi in the January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election, in an &quot;off the books&quot; campaign conducted by retired CIA officers and non-government personnel, and with funds &quot;not necessarily&quot; appropriated by Congress.

=== Iran ===
In a January 2005 article for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; titled &quot;The Coming Wars&quot;, Hersh wrote that the next U.S. target in the Middle East was Iran, and alleged that covert U.S. reconnaissance missions, including a commando task force, had infiltrated the country to gather intelligence on nuclear, chemical, and missile sites since mid-2004. In April 2006, an article by Hersh titled &quot;The Iran Plans&quot; alleged that the Bush administration was accelerating military planning for an attack on Iran, and that the Pentagon had presented the White House the option of using bunker-buster nuclear weapons on the country&#x27;s underground uranium enrichment sites; he further alleged that the Joint Chiefs of Staff later sought to drop this option, which had been resisted by White House officials. The article also alleged that U.S. troops were infiltrating Iran to establish contact with anti-government minority groups, and that carrier-based aircraft were flying simulated nuclear bombing runs. Hersh wrote several more pieces on this alleged plan in the next two years, including a July 2006 article on how senior commanders were challenging Bush&#x27;s plan for a major bombing campaign, articles in November 2006 and March 2007 on the plan&#x27;s re-focusing on targets in Iran aiding Iraqi militants, and an October 2007 article on planned &quot;surgical&quot; strikes on Iranian Quds Force training camps and supply depots.

In an August 2006 article, Hersh alleged that the U.S. was involved in the planning of Israel&#x27;s attacks on Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon War as a &quot;prelude&quot; to the U.S. bombing of Iran. In his March 2007 article, titled &quot;The Redirection&quot;, he alleged that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia were covertly supporting Sunni extremist groups to combat the influence of Shiite Iran and Syria, and that the Lebanese government of Fouad Siniora was using its U.S. backing to supply weapons to Osbat al-Ansar and Fatah al-Islam, militant groups in Palestinian refugee camps, to develop a counter-balance to Shiite-backed Hezbollah. In May 2007, Lebanon launched an attack on Fatah al-Islam, which it accused of having ties to the Syrian government, starting a severe domestic conflict.

In a June 2008 article titled &quot;Preparing the Battlefield&quot;, Hersh alleged that Congress had secretly appropriated $400 million for a major escalation of covert operations against Iran in late 2007, following a request from President Bush. The request allegedly &quot;focused on undermining Iran&#x27;s nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change&quot;, and included new activities such as the funding of opposition groups in the south and east of the country. The article also alleged that Vice President Dick Cheney, after a January 2008 incident in the Strait of Hormuz in which a U.S. warship had nearly fired on Iranian boats, had held a meeting on how to create a casus belli for a war; Hersh later said in an interview that one of the options discussed and rejected was a false flag operation involving Navy SEALs, who would pose as Iranian patrols and start a firefight with U.S. ships. Hersh later began writing a book on Cheney in 2011, on which he spent four years before dropping amid a crackdown on leaks, instead writing his 2018 memoir &quot;Reporter&quot;.

Hersh alleged in a May 2011 article titled &quot;Iran And the Bomb&quot; that the U.S. lacked conclusive evidence that Iran was developing nuclear weapons, citing a still-classified National Intelligence Estimate produced by the National Intelligence Council earlier that year. The summary of the 2007 estimate, which had been released publicly, had found &quot;with high confidence&quot; that Iran had halted its weapons program in late 2003 after the invasion of Iraq; Hersh alleged that the 2011 estimate found that this program had been aimed at Iraq (which Iran had believed to be developing a nuclear weapon), not Israel or the U.S., and that no new evidence had changed the 2007 assessment, despite expanded covert surveillance. In a November 2011 article after the release of a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on possible military dimensions of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, Hersh disputed that the findings were new or transformative, arguing that there remained &quot;no definitive evidence&quot; of a weapons program, and calling the report a &quot;political document&quot; in an interview.

In an April 2012 article, Hersh alleged that the U.S. trained members of the Iranian dissident group Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK), listed as a &quot;foreign terrorist organization&quot; by the State Department, at a site in Nevada from 2005 to 2007, and had provided intelligence for its assassinations of nuclear scientists.

=== Syria and chemical attacks ===
In the early weeks of the Iraq War in 2003, Hersh traveled to Damascus in Syria and interviewed President Bashar al-Assad, whom he interviewed several more times in following years, the latest in early 2010; he also interviewed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. In February 2008, an article by Hersh questioned the Israeli and American claims that a Syrian facility bombed by Israel in September 2007 was an under-construction nuclear reactor; a later report by the IAEA in 2011 found it was &quot;very likely&quot; that it was a secret reactor. An article by Hersh in April 2009, citing his email correspondence with Assad, suggested that Syria was eager for peace with Israel over the Golan Heights, as well as negotiations with the U.S. over its withdrawal from Iraq and Syria&#x27;s support for Hamas and Hezbollah. Hersh concluded that the Obama administration had a chance for diplomacy with Syria and perhaps Iran.

On December 8, 2013, an article by Hersh titled &quot;Whose sarin?&quot;, published in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; (&quot;LRB&quot;), alleged that the Obama administration had &quot;cherry-picked intelligence&quot; on the August 21, 2013, sarin attack at Ghouta during the Syrian Civil War, which had killed hundreds of civilians, in order to attribute the attack to Assad&#x27;s government and justify a military strike. The article, which had been rejected by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, alleged that U.S. intelligence had found by June 2013 that al-Nusra, a branch of al-Qaeda and part of the Syrian opposition, was also capable of producing and deploying sarin gas. The article cited munitions expert Theodore Postol, who judged that the rockets used in the attack were improvised, and that their estimated range of was inconsistent with a proposed flight path from a Syrian Army base away. In a second article published in the &quot;LRB&quot; in April 2014, titled &quot;The Red Line and the Rat Line&quot;, Hersh alleged that the attack was conducted by al-Nusra with the aid of the Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a false flag operation aimed at drawing the U.S. into the war against Assad. It described an alleged supply chain operation, organized by the CIA and the United Kingdom&#x27;s MI6 with funding from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which transported weapons to the Syrian rebels from Libya via southern Turkey between early 2012 and the September 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate and CIA annex at Benghazi. Hersh alleged that Turkey&#x27;s National Intelligence Organization and Gendarmerie had proceeded to instruct al-Nusra on producing and deploying sarin, and that the planned U.S. strike was averted after British intelligence found that samples of sarin from Ghouta did not match batches from Syria&#x27;s arsenal.

A report from an investigation by the United Nations (UN) concluded that sarin had been used at Ghouta, but did not assign responsibility for the attack. Blogger Eliot Higgins and chemical weapons expert Dan Kaszeta disputed some of the claims in the articles with open-source intelligence, writing that the &quot;improvised&quot; rockets had been used by the Syrian Army as early as November 2012, and that the front lines on the day of the attack were just from the impact sites, within Postol&#x27;s estimated range. They also criticized the claim of al-Nusra responsibility, citing the high difficulty and expense of producing sarin, and the presence of hexamine in the Ghouta samples, an additive which Syria later declared part of its chemical weapons program.

In a December 2015 article in the &quot;LRB&quot; titled &quot;Military to Military&quot;, Hersh alleged that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after discovering by mid-2013 that Turkey was aiding al-Nusra and the Islamic State (ISIS) and that the moderate rebels were no longer viable, had sabotaged Obama&#x27;s support for the rebels by sending U.S. intelligence to the militaries of Germany, Russia, and Israel, on the understanding it would be forwarded to Assad. In exchange for this support, aimed at defeating ISIS, Hersh alleged that the Joint Chiefs had required that Assad &quot;restrain&quot; Hezbollah from attacking Israel, restart negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights, agree to accept Russian advisers, and hold elections after the war. This alleged alliance ended in September 2015 upon the retirement of its architect, chairman General Martin Dempsey. Max Fisher of &quot;Vox&quot; criticized the narrative, citing reporting that Syria and Russia were primarily bombing anti-ISIS rebels instead of ISIS, and Dempsey&#x27;s prominent public support for sending more arms to the rebels, over which he had clashed with Obama.

On June 25, 2017, the German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; published Hersh&#x27;s article &quot;Trump&#x27;s Red Line&quot;, which had been rejected by the &quot;LRB&quot;. It alleged that the Syrian Air Force&#x27;s April 4, 2017, attack at Khan Shaykhun was not a sarin attack, but a conventional bombing conducted with Russian intelligence that struck a regional headquarters building with &quot;fertilisers, disinfectants and other goods&quot; in its basement, which created &quot;effects similar to those of sarin&quot;. The article further alleged that the April 7 missile strike on Shayrat Airbase, ordered by President Trump, was conducted despite U.S. intelligence affirming a conventional bombing. Higgins again criticized Hersh&#x27;s claims, writing for Bellingcat that they were inconsistent with Syrian and Russian descriptions of the target and satellite images of the impact sites, as well as findings of sarin and hexamine in samples retrieved by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). A later investigation by a joint UN–OPCW panel found that the attack was a sarin bombing by the Syrian Air Force.

===Killing of Osama bin Laden ===

In a September 2013 interview, Hersh commented that the U.S.&#x27;s account of the May 2, 2011, raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which killed Osama bin Laden was &quot;one big lie, not one word of it is true&quot;. He stated that both the Obama administration and Pakistan had lied about the event, and that American media outlets were reluctant to challenge the administration, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama]&quot;. Hersh later said that his sources told him that the official story was false days after the raid, but that &quot;The New Yorker&quot; had rejected his article pitches.

On May 10, 2015, a 10,000-word article by Hersh detailing an alternative account of the raid, titled &quot;The Killing of Osama bin Laden&quot;, was published in the &quot;London Review of Books.&quot; The official account was that bin Laden had been located through interrogation of detainees and surveillance of his courier, that Pakistan was unaware of the operation, and that he was killed only when he did not surrender; Hersh reported that bin Laden had been captured and held as a prisoner of Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) since 2006, that his location was revealed to the CIA by a former Pakistani intelligence officer in 2010, that top Pakistani military officials knew about the operation, and that bin Laden had been assassinated. The article alleged Pakistan had kept bin Laden, with financial support from Saudi Arabia, as leverage against al-Qaeda, and that it agreed to give him up in exchange for increased U.S. military aid and a &quot;freer hand in Afghanistan&quot;. Further allegations were that bin Laden&#x27;s DNA had been collected by a Pakistani Army doctor, not by Shakil Afridi in a fake vaccination drive by the CIA; that the Navy SEALs met no resistance at the compound, and were escorted by an ISI officer; that bin Laden&#x27;s body was torn apart by rifle fire; and that pieces of his corpse were tossed out over the Hindu Kush mountains on the flight back to Jalalabad, rather than being buried at sea. A book compiling the article and Hersh&#x27;s pieces on Syria for the magazine, &quot;The Killing of Osama bin Laden&quot;, was published in 2016&quot;.&quot;

Hersh&#x27;s article was heavily criticized by other reporters. The narrative was similar to a little-known August 2011 post by national security blogger R.J. Hillhouse, who called Hersh&#x27;s article &quot;either plagiarism or unoriginal&quot;, though she speculated they used different sources; Hersh denied having read her work. Max Fisher of &quot;Vox&quot; accused Hersh&#x27;s story of &quot;internal contradictions&quot; and &quot;troubling inconsistencies&quot; in a long article, questioning among other claims that the U.S. and Pakistan had struck a secret deal, as U.S. military aid had fallen and relations had deteriorated in following years. Peter Bergen of CNN, who visited the compound after the raid, disputed that the only shots fired were those that killed bin Laden, writing that he had seen evidence of an extended firefight. Both journalists, as well as Jack Shafer at &quot;Politico&quot; and James Kirchick at &quot;Slate&quot;, criticized Hersh&#x27;s sources: an unnamed &quot;retired senior [U.S.] intelligence official&quot;, &quot;two longtime consultants to the Special Operations Command&quot;, and retired Pakistani General Asad Durrani, who headed the ISI from 1990 to 1992, with Fisher writing that this was &quot;worryingly little evidence for a story that accuses hundreds of people across three governments of staging a massive international hoax that has gone on for years&quot;. Fisher also questioned that Pakistan had insisted on an elaborate raid over simpler and lower-risk methods, asking why bin Laden was not killed and his body handed over, or killed in a staged U.S. drone strike. Hersh&#x27;s article stated that a drone strike was the raid&#x27;s original cover story before one of the Black Hawk helicopters crashed and was demolished, which was impossible to hide.

Some details in Hersh&#x27;s article were corroborated by Carlotta Gall of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who reported that she had previously been told by a &quot;high-level member&quot; of the ISI that Pakistan had been hiding bin Laden and that an ISI brigadier had informed the CIA of his location; NBC News also corroborated the claim of a retired ISI officer who had tipped off the CIA. Pakistani news outlets alleged the tipster was Brigadier Usman Khalid, who died in 2014. In an article in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, praised an article by Ali Watkins of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; as one of the few that identified the tipster development as discrediting the CIA&#x27;s claim that its torture of detainees had revealed the identity of bin Laden&#x27;s courier, which had previously been challenged by the December 2014 report on torture by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

=== Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine ===
On February 8, 2023, in a newsletter article titled &quot;How America Took Out The Nord Stream Pipeline&quot;, Hersh alleged that the September 26, 2022, sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which had carried natural gas from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea, was carried out by the U.S. in a top-secret CIA operation ordered by President Joe Biden, with collaboration from Norway. The self-published post, which relied on one anonymous source &quot;with direct knowledge of the operational planning&quot;, alleged that U.S. Navy divers operating from a Norwegian ship, using NATO&#x27;s BALTOPS 22 exercise in June 2022 as cover, had planted C-4 mines which were later remotely detonated by a sonar buoy dropped from a Norwegian plane. The alleged motive was reducing Russian economic influence in Europe and cutting off a major source of state revenue; Nord Stream 2 was not yet operational, but would have doubled the gas supply of Nord Stream 1. Hersh cited statements against the pipeline made by Biden and his foreign policy team as support, including Biden&#x27;s warning in February 2022, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that: &quot;If Russia invades... there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it.&quot;

The party responsible for the attack, which rendered three of the four pipelines inoperable, was not widely known at the time of Hersh&#x27;s report. Western countries had not formally accused Russia, though some officials suggested it was responsible; Germany, Denmark, and Sweden had each opened investigations into the attack. Russia had accused the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy and later the U.S., and disputed the idea it would destroy the pipelines, which it owned a large stake in through Gazprom. Kelly Vlahos, a senior advisor at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, described the U.S. mainstream media response to Hersh&#x27;s post as a &quot;total blackout&quot;, and wrote that his reporting &quot;should have opened the floodgates of journalistic inquiry&quot;. The post received widespread attention in independent media and European mainstream media, including in Germany; the Bundestag held its first debate on the bombing on February 10, in which members from Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Die Linke cited Hersh and called on the executive branch to release the results of its investigation, which it had said would be kept secret. In Russia, Hersh&#x27;s report was picked up by the state-owned media agencies RT and TASS. At a UN Security Council meeting on February 21, Russia&#x27;s representative Vasily Nebenzya cited Hersh and called for an independent UN investigation.

Some of the post&#x27;s claims were criticized by writers using open-source intelligence. In a post, blogger Oliver Alexander disputed the claim that the U.S. divers operated from a Norwegian &quot;Alta&quot;-class minesweeper, as no ships of the class had taken part in BALTOPS 22; he noted the participation of the &quot;Hinnøy&quot;, a member of the similar &quot;Oksøy&quot; mine hunter class, but wrote that AIS data from the ship showed that it had passed several kilometers from the sites at its closest, without slowing down. He wrote that ADS-B records did not show the alleged &quot;seemingly routine flight&quot; by a Norwegian P-8 Poseidon in the hours before the explosions, and questioned the claim that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had co-operated with U.S. intelligence since the Vietnam War, as Stoltenberg was 16 years old in 1975. Hersh replied that the open-source location data could have been manipulated by spoofing or disabling transponders. Alexander later wrote that satellite images showed the &quot;Hinnøy&quot; sailing in formation at six locations, matching AIS data. In March 2023, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that new intelligence suggested a &quot;pro-Ukrainian group&quot; was responsible for the attack, and the German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot; reported that German police found it was carried out by six people of unclear nationality diving from a yacht rented from a Ukrainian-owned Polish company. In a second post, Hersh alleged that this account was a false flag fabrication created by the CIA and fed to U.S. and German outlets.

In an April 2023 article, Hersh alleged that figures in the Ukrainian government of Volodymyr Zelensky had embezzled at least $400 million of U.S. aid to the country, intended for the purchase of diesel fuel, by buying discount diesel from Russia, citing an alleged analysis produced by the CIA.

== Other statements ==

=== Speeches ===

In a 2005 interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Hersh made a distinction between the strict standards of accuracy observed in his print reporting and the leeway he allowed himself in speeches, in which he spoke informally about stories still being worked on, or changed information to protect his sources: &quot;Sometimes I change events, dates, and places in a certain way to protect people. ... I can&#x27;t fudge what I write. But I can certainly fudge what I say.&quot;

In a July 2004 speech to the American Civil Liberties Union, at the height of the Abu Ghraib scandal, Hersh alleged that there existed video tapes of young boys being sexually assaulted at the prison, in which their &quot;shrieking&quot; could be heard. In his book &quot;Chain of Command&quot;, however, he clarified that a lawyer in the case had told him about a prisoner witness statement which described the alleged rape of a boy by a foreign contract employee who worked as an interpreter, as a woman was taking pictures. Hersh later stated: &quot;I actually didn&#x27;t quite say what I wanted to say correctly. ... It wasn&#x27;t that inaccurate, but it was misstated. The next thing I know, it was all over the blogs.&quot;

In a March 2009 speech at the University of Minnesota, Hersh alleged that the Bush administration had authorized the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to locate and kill targets in a program which reported only to Vice President Cheney, outside of the chain of command, in what Hersh described as an &quot;executive assassination ring&quot;. In a January 2011 speech in Doha, Qatar, Hersh alleged that General Stanley A. McChrystal, head of the JSOC from 2003 to 2008, and his successor Admiral William H. McRaven were &quot;members, or at least supporters&quot; of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic lay religious order, and that many JSOC officers were members of the Catholic institution Opus Dei; McChrystal denied the allegation. Hersh further alleged that some military leaders viewed the U.S. wars in the Middle East as a &quot;crusade&quot;, in which they were protecting Christians from Muslims &quot;[as] in the 13th century&quot;.

===Murder of Seth Rich===
In a January 2017 phone conversation about the 2016 murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, Hersh told Fox News commentator Ed Butowsky that he had heard about an FBI report which found that Rich had tried to sell emails to WikiLeaks prior to his death. Although cautioned by Hersh that the information may not be true, Butowsky forwarded the taped call to the Rich family, who were encouraged to hire a private investigator quoted in a later-retracted Fox News article on the alleged FBI report. Hersh later said that he had relayed &quot;gossip&quot;, and that he was fishing for information.

=== Pat Nixon abuse ===
In his 2018 autobiography &quot;Reporter,&quot; Hersh wrote that he had heard in 1974 that Pat Nixon, wife of former president Richard Nixon, had been treated in an emergency room in California after her husband had hit her, and that former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman told him of two previous incidents in which Nixon struck her. Hersh chose not to report on the alleged abuse because he considered it part of Nixon&#x27;s private life, a decision which he later regretted.

== Use of anonymous sources ==
Hersh&#x27;s reporting is well-known for its use of anonymous sources, which his biographer Robert Miraldi described as his &quot;trademark&quot;. While working as a Pentagon correspondent for the AP, he developed many anonymous top- and mid-level military sources, leading Pentagon officials to deride the fact that he &quot;broke every rule of bureaucratic journalism&quot;. His AP colleague Richard Pyle later observed that &quot;people were somewhat annoyed that he had no or few names in so many of his stories&quot;. Hersh&#x27;s articles on the Watergate scandal, like those of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, made extensive use of unnamed sources, including deep inside the White House, Justice Department, and Congress. Hersh&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; editor A. M. Rosenthal warned him to halt his practice of &quot;ascribing long, colorful pejorative comments in direct quotes to anonymous officials&quot;. After Hersh&#x27;s articles on CIA involvement in the Chilean coup, largely based on unnamed CIA sources, Rosenthal praised his work but again warned about sources: &quot;It&#x27;s our obligation to be extremely careful, restrained and judicious. Using them puzzles the reader at the best, and raises questions about the credibility of the story at the worst.&quot;

Hersh&#x27;s conservative critics frequently accused him of a left-wing bias in his reporting on the My Lai massacre and later stories. Hersh responded that: &quot;I don&#x27;t go around getting my stories from nice old Lefties or the Weathermen ... I get them from good old-fashioned constitutionalists. I learned a long time ago that you can&#x27;t go around making judgments on the basis of people&#x27;s politics. The essential thing is: Do they have integrity or not?&quot; Henry Kissinger, in response to Hersh&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;The Price of Power&quot;, accused him of including &quot;inference piled on assumption, third-hand hearsay accepted as fact, the self-serving accounts of disgruntled adversaries elevated to gospel, the &#x27;impressions&#x27; of people several times removed from the scene.&quot; Hersh&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;The Target Is Destroyed&quot; was especially noted for its anonymous sources, with Hersh admitting that: &quot;This is a book whose key allegations hinge on unnamed sources ... mysterious &#x27;government officials&#x27; and &#x27;intelligence analysts&#x27;.&quot;, and his 1991 book &quot;The Samson Option&quot; was similar, with journalist Steven Emerson writing in a review that it relied on Hersh&#x27;s mere reputation: &quot;If anyone else wrote this book, it would have never seen the light of day&quot;. Hersh&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;The Dark Side of Camelot&quot; used very few unnamed sources, but its document hoax controversy and dubious claims drew the criticism of many in the media, with Kennedy biographer Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. calling him &quot;the most gullible investigative reporter perhaps in American history&quot;.

Hersh&#x27;s articles for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, like his previous articles at the &quot;Times&quot; under Rosenthal, were reviewed by an active editor (David Remnick) and a team of fact-checkers. In a 2003 interview with the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, Remnick stated that he knew the identity of all of Hersh&#x27;s sources: &quot;I know every single source that is in his pieces ... Every &#x27;retired intelligence officer&#x27;, every general with reason to know, and all those phrases that one has to use, alas, by necessity, I say, &#x27;Who is it? What&#x27;s his interest?&#x27; We talk it through.&quot; Hersh&#x27;s reporting on the Middle East after 9/11 drew renewed criticism of his unnamed sources; journalist Amir Taheri wrote in a review of Hersh&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Chain of Command&quot; that: &quot;Hersh uses the method of medieval scholastics: first choose your belief, then seek proofs. ... By my count Hersh has anonymous sources inside 30 foreign governments and virtually every department of the U.S. government.&quot; Remnick defended Hersh, arguing that unnamed sources were needed in intelligence reporting due to the risk taken by sources, who faced dismissal or prosecution. Hersh said of his reporting of the &quot;war on terror&quot; that: &quot;[T]he only way you measure my stories in any reasonable way is to say that I&#x27;ve been writing an alternative history of the war. And the question is: Is it basically right? And I think overwhelmingly it&#x27;s right.&quot; Journalist William Arkin, who worked with Hersh in the 1990s, responded to critics of Hersh&#x27;s errors that: &quot;He can get every fact wrong but get the story correct.&quot;

Hersh&#x27;s reporting outside of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; has been criticized for allegedly being subjected to less editorial review and fact-checking. Hersh stated that his 2013 article on the Ghouta chemical attack, published in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; (&quot;LRB&quot;), had been rejected because &quot;[Remnick] didn&#x27;t feel it was strong enough&quot;. In 2015, he stated that the &quot;LRB&quot; had used a former fact-checker from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for his article on the killing of Osama bin Laden.&quot;&quot; Journalist James Kirchick criticized Hersh&#x27;s later reporting for uncritically treating information provided to him by &quot;cranks&quot;, which he wrote were attracted to Hersh because he shared a &quot;conspiratorial&quot; view of the world where &quot;dark, shadowy&quot; forces ruled. Hersh replied that: &quot;There&#x27;s zero value in taking just the line of government agencies and official spokespeople ... So that makes you reliant on people who have agendas, as all sources usually do, and it attracts people who believe in conspiracies. A lot of intelligence work is finding connections, a bit of an occupational hazard.&quot; 

Criticism of Hersh and his sources was renewed after his 2017 article on the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, published by &quot;Die Welt&quot; after &quot;LRB&quot; editor Mary-Kay Wilmers told him she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be accused of being too pro-Russian and too pro-Syria&quot;, and Hersh&#x27;s 2023 post on the Nord Stream sabotage, which was self-published on Substack and relied on a single anonymous source. Later in 2023, after Hersh cited an alleged U.S. official describing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a &quot;poor waif in his underwear&quot;, a translation of an idiomatic Russian expression and not otherwise common in English, some commentators speculated that Hersh&#x27;s source had in fact been Russian-speaking.

<doc id="316119" wikidata="Q1858128" url="?curid=316119" title="Swedish bagpipes">
<text>Swedish bagpipes (säckpipa, , or &quot;dråmba&quot;, &quot;koppe&quot;, &quot;posu&quot;, or &quot;bälgpipa&quot;) are a variety of bagpipes from Sweden. The term itself generically translates to &quot;bagpipes&quot; in Swedish, but is used in English to describe the specifically Swedish bagpipe from the Dalarna region.

==History==

Medieval paintings in churches suggest that the instrument was spread all over Sweden. The instrument was practically extinct by the middle of the 20th century; the instrument that today is referred to as Swedish bagpipes is a construction based on instruments from the western parts of the district called Dalarna, the only region of Sweden where the bagpipe tradition survived into the 20th century.

==Revival==

In late 1930s, the ethnologist Mats Rehnberg found some bagpipes in the collections of the museum Nordiska museet, and he wrote a thesis on the subject. Rehnberg managed to find the last carrier of Swedish bagpipe tradition, Gudmunds Nils Larsson in the village Dala-Järna. Rehnberg visited Larsson together with a music teacher, Ture Gudmundsson, who managed to reconstruct an instrument, with which Ture later played and recorded two tunes for the national publicly funded radio broadcaster Sveriges Radio.

During the following decades only a few instruments were made, until 1981 when woodworker Leif Eriksson (pipemaker) started to manufacture a model of bagpipes that he himself had developed, and the folk fiddler Per Gudmundson learned to play it. Eriksson&#x27;s bagpipes was a compromise between the roughly ten different instruments held in museums, and he made some slight modifications to make the instruments better suited for playing with other instruments such as the fiddle.

Today there are several Swedish folk music groups that include the bag pipes in their setting, such as Hedningarna, Svanevit and Dråm (the two latter involving Erik Ask-Upmark and Anna Rynefors). Players of the Swedish pipes are now eligible to compete playing traditional music before a jury to earn the title of &quot;riksspelman&quot;.

==Construction==
The bag is notably smaller than that of many other bagpipes. This, however, is no major problem as the pipes require relatively little air. The chanter has a single cane reed and a cylindrical bore, with a range of one octave. It is essentially diatonic (with a melodic ascending A minor—A major with a flat third—scale starting on E) since cross-fingering has little effect.
===Evolution===

*A double hole for the C hole instead of a single one can be bored, one of which can be covered, for example with beeswax, to produce C, and uncovered to produce C#. This makes the key of A major possible.
*The &#x27;tuning hole&#x27;, a hole traditionally placed on the underside of the chanter and which is used for tuning the bottom note of the chanter (with beeswax to make the hole smaller), can be placed on the top side instead, enabling it to be used as a fingerhole. This adds a low D to the scale.
*A key can be fitted to operate a hole above the usual fingerholes, to give the piper an additional high F#.

The fact that the chanter, with its cylindrical bore and single reed, is extremely unaffected by crossfingering, and that the drone is tuned to the same note and octave as the bottom note of the chanter, makes it possible to play in a closed or semi-closed manner, enabling the player to quickly play the bottom note in between other notes—since this will blend with the sound of the drone, it gives the illusion of silence, and the possibility to play staccato.

The tone of the instrument is quite soft, not too different from that of a harmonica or an accordion.

===Makers===
Today, there are a small number of professional or semi-professional bagpipe designers. Leif Eriksson (pipemaker) represents the traditional one; Alban Faust, Börs Anders Öhman, Max Persson and Seth Hamon drive the development towards modern instruments.

<text>Maringá () is a municipality in southern Brazil founded on 10 May 1947 as a planned urban area. It is the third largest city in the state of Paraná, with 385,753 inhabitants in the city proper, and 764,906 in the metropolitan area (IBGE 2013). Located in northwestern Paraná, and crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn, it is a regional centre for commerce, services, agro-industries, and universities, including the State University of Maringá.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Maringá takes its name from a song by Joubert de Carvalho in honour of his great love, Maria do Ingá, later shortened to Maringá. As a result, the city is nicknamed &quot;Song City&quot;. At the time the settlement was established, the song was very popular in the media.

===Settlement===
In 1925, the Northern Paraná Land Company was established in London, England and was responsible for the management of more than in the northern part of the State, which today contains some of the largest cities in Paraná.

The region&#x27;s fertile land encouraged São Paulo colonists to move in and acquire new areas for production of coffee beans, an important product for exportation.
The northern region of Paraná encloses nearly 100 thousand km2. It is watered by the Rivers Paranapanema, Paraná, Ivaí and Piquiri.
The urban project requested by the British Company Improvements North of the Paraná (Melhoramentos Co.) and elaborated by the city planner Jorge Macedo Vieira, defined the outlines of the new city. Maringá received the status of municipality on 14 November 1951.

The company, worried about deforestation proceeding from the occupation foreseen in the urbanistics projects, reserved three great ecological areas within the urban limits: the Forest Horto, the Park of the Ingá and Forest II and the city was planned as a &quot;garden city&quot; from the beginning.
==Demography==

==Geography==
===Climate===
Maringá experiences a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;, according to Köppen) bordering on a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). It has well distributed rainfall, where the average temperature of the coldest month is around 17.8 °C (64 °F) and average annual temperatures around 21.95 °C (71.51 °F).
Because of its location, situated in southern Brazil and crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn, the region of Maringá is influenced by several macro-climatic factors caused by migration of air masses from the Atlantic Ocean and from the Tropical zone.
In the winter the infiltration of cold air from the polar front is relatively common, and frosts can occur.

The city preserves within its limits large areas of native forest in the Horto Florestal, Parque dos Pioneiros (Bosque II) and Parque do Inga, this being open to the public. It also includes smaller preserved areas as the Parque do Cinquentenário, private areas and so on.

Throughout the year it is possible to observe its tree-lined streets that produce a good air to breathe, but especially in the passage from winter to spring, many trees explode in flowers.

Maringá has one of the highest concentration rates of green area, per inhabitant, 90 bushels of native forest in 17 forests.

===Pollution===
Even with the normal problems of urban centers, Maringá preserves its reputation as a green city, ecologically well cared for. Its origin had planning, urban planning - forest reserves, central construction site, wide avenues, several species of trees that follow a Master Plan

Proportionally, Maringá has one of the largest fleets per capita of vehicles of Paraná State. Because of it, there are some places of the city with pollution levels above the recommended. Two regions in the city are the biggest problems, they are the avenue Duque de Caxias and Colombo. Industries, pesticides, noise pollution and household waste, also contribute very significantly to the pollution of the city. In spite of this, Maringá still preserves a reputation of green city.

<text>Manduessedum or Manduesedum was a Roman fort and later a civilian small town in the Roman Province of Britannia. It was located on and immediately to the east of the site of the modern village of Mancetter, located in the English county of Warwickshire, close to the modern town of Atherstone. The name is of Romano-Celtic origin, and is likely derived from the Gaulish &quot;essedum&quot;, meaning &#x27;chariot&#x27;, whilst the first element &quot;mandu&quot; was common in Gaulish place names, but its meaning is obscure.

The fort was founded in around AD 50 on the Watling Street Roman road, guarding the point where the road crossed the River Anker. The final battle of the rebel queen of the Britons Boudica at the Battle of Watling Street in AD 60/61 may have taken place near Manduessedum. The British forces were defeated by the Roman general Suetonius Paullinus. The fort appears to have been fairly short lived, as there is little sign of military occupation at the site after AD 70.

Manduessedum later developed into an important civilian settlement, and was the centre of an extensive pottery making industry which primarily produced Mortaria (mixing bowls). The remains of up to 70 pottery kilns dating from the Roman period have been found in the area, as well as the remains of a Roman villa. The area has been listed as a scheduled monument.

<text>Mancetter is a village and civil parish in North Warwickshire, England, where Watling Street crosses the River Anker. The population was 2,339 at the 2011 census. It is adjoined with the town of Atherstone, on the B4111 road towards Hartshill and Nuneaton.

==History==
In Roman Britain, a posting station was built along Watling Street close to the river crossing, and a rectangular earthwork of this is still extant. The much larger legionary fortress of the Legio XIV Gemina was built here by about 50 AD, before the legion moved to Wroxeter in about 55. Around the fortress grew the settlement of &quot;Manduessedum&quot;. Mancetter has been suggested as a possible location of the Defeat of Boudica, between an alliance of indigenous British peoples led by Boudica and a Roman army led by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, although the exact location is unknown. 

Mancetter does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086, but in 1196 a Walter de Mancetter granted land to endow the parish church. The chancel walls of the Church of England parish church of Saint Peter still include 12th-century masonry. The chancel and nave were remodelled early in the 13th century and the north aisle was added later in the 13th century. The bell tower, the south aisle and the clerestory of the nave all seem to have been added in the 15th century. The south porch was added early in the 17th century. Restoration work was carried out in 1876, 1911 and 1930, and the Gothic Revival architect C.C. Rolfe may have undertaken restoration work in 1899. 

The tower has a peal of five bells, of which the oldest was cast about 1350, another early in the 16th century and the treble, tenor and third bell in the middle of the 17th century. The advowson of St. Peter&#x27;s was impropriated by the Cistercian Abbey of Merevale in 1449. Mancetter Manor is a timber-framed building dating from about 1330. An intermediate floor was inserted in the great hall in about 1480 and the south wing was added in about 1580. The central chimneystack was probably inserted in the 17th century, and small extensions to the house were made in the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Etymology==
The modern name Mancetter is a reduced form of an old Celtic name &quot;Manduessedum&quot;, first recorded in the Antonine Itinerary in the 4th Century. It is composed of a British element *mandu – ‘horse’ or ‘pony’ and a Gaulish *essedo - ‘horse chariot’. Although the first element is common in Gaulish names, the application of the second element to a place-name is obscure. The second element of the modern name is ultimately from the OE -ceaster – ‘a city, an old (Roman) fortification, Roman site’. By the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066 &quot;ceaster&quot; was probably pronounced roughly like modern &quot;Chester&quot;. The form -cetter reflects the difficulty that some French-speaking Norman clerks had with the English sounds &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;st&quot; (compare also Exeter, Old English &quot;Escanceaster&quot;).

<text>Sabazios (, &quot;Savázios&quot;; alternatively, &quot;Sabadios&quot;) is a deity originating in Asia Minor. He is the horseman and sky father god of the Phrygians and Thracians.

Sabazios gained prominence across the Roman Empire, particularly favored in the Central Balkans due to Thracian influence. Scholarly debate has long debated Sabazios&#x27; origins, with current consensus leaning towards his Phrygian roots.

Though the Greeks interpreted Phrygian Sabazios as both Zeus and Dionysus, representations of him, even into Roman times, show him always on horseback, wielding his characteristic staff of power.

== Epigraphic evidence ==
According to scholars, the deity&#x27;s name is variously written in epigraphy: Σεβάζιος, Σαβάζοις, Sabazius, Sabadius, Σαβασεἷος.

==Thracian/Phrygian Sabazios==
It seems likely that the migrating Phrygians brought Sabazios with them when they settled in Anatolia in the early first millennium BCE, and that the god&#x27;s origins are to be looked for in Macedonia and Thrace. The ancient sanctuary of Perperikon in modern-day Bulgaria, uncovered in 2000, is believed to be that of Sabazios. 

Possible early conflict between Sabazios and his followers and the indigenous mother goddess of Phrygia (Cybele) may be reflected in Homer&#x27;s brief reference to the youthful feats of Priam, who aided the Phrygians in their battles with Amazons. An aspect of the compromise religious settlement, similar to the other such mythic adjustments throughout Aegean culture, can be read in the later Phrygian King Gordias&#x27; adoption &quot;with Cybele&quot; of Midas.

One of the native religion&#x27;s creatures was the Lunar Bull. Sabazios&#x27; relations with the goddess may be surmised in the way that his horse places a hoof on the head of the bull, in a Roman marble relief at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Though Roman in date, the iconic image appears to be much earlier.

==God on horseback==
More &quot;rider god&quot; steles are at the Burdur Museum, in Turkey. Under the Roman Emperor Gordian III the god on horseback appears on coins minted at Tlos, in neighboring Lycia, and at Istrus, in the province of Lower Moesia, between Thrace and the Danube. It is generally thought that the young emperor&#x27;s grandfather came from an Anatolian family, because of his unusual cognomen, Gordianus. The iconic image of the god or hero on horseback battling the chthonic serpent, on which his horse tramples, appears on Celtic votive columns, and with the coming of Christianity it was easily transformed into the image of Saint George and the Dragon, whose earliest known depictions are from tenth- and eleventh-century Cappadocia and eleventh-century Georgia and Armenia.

==Iconography, depictions, and Hellenistic associations==

Among Roman inscriptions from Nicopolis ad Istrum, Sabazios is generally equated with Jove and mentioned alongside Mercury. Similarly in Hellenistic monuments, Sabazios is either explicitly (via inscriptions) or implicitly (via iconography) associated with Zeus. On a marble slab from Philippopolis, Sabazios is depicted as a curly-haired and bearded central deity among several gods and goddesses. Under his left foot is a ram&#x27;s head, and he holds in his left hand a sceptre tipped with a hand in the benedictio latina gesture. Sabazios is accompanied by busts on his right depicting Luna, Pan, and Mercury, and on his left by Sol, Fortuna, and Daphne. According to Macrobius, Liber and Helios were worshipped among the Thracians as Sabazios; this description fits other Classical accounts that identify Sabazios with Dionysos. Sabazios is also associated with a number of archeological finds depicting a bronze, right hand in the benedictio latina gesture. The hand appears to have had ritual significance and may have been affixed to a sceptre (as the one carried by Sabazios on the Philippopolis slab). Although there are many variations, the hand of Sabazios is typically depicted with a pinecone on the thumb and with a serpent or pair of serpents encircling the wrist and surmounting the bent ring and pinky fingers. Additional symbols occasionally included on the hands of Sabazios include a lightning bolt over the index and middle fingers, a turtle and lizard on the back of the hand, an eagle, a ram, a leafless branch, the thyrsos, and the Mounted Heros.

==Sabazios in Athens==
The ecstatic Eastern rites practiced largely by women in Athens were thrown together for rhetorical purposes by Demosthenes in undermining his opponent Aeschines for participating in his mother&#x27;s cultic associations:
On attaining manhood you abetted your mother in her initiations and the other rituals, and read aloud from the cultic writings ... You rubbed the fat-cheeked snakes and swung them above your head, crying &quot;Euoi saboi&quot; and &quot;hues attes, attes hues&quot;.

==Transformation to &quot;Sabazius&quot;==
Transference of Sabazios to the Roman world appears to have been mediated in large part through Pergamum. The naturally syncretic approach of Greek religion blurred distinctions. Later Greek writers, like Strabo in the first century CE, linked Sabazios with Zagreus, among Phrygian ministers and attendants of the sacred rites of Rhea and Dionysos. Strabo&#x27;s Sicilian contemporary, Diodorus Siculus, conflated Sabazios with the secret &#x27;second&#x27; Dionysus, born of Zeus and Persephone, a connection that is not borne out by surviving inscriptions, which are entirely to &quot;Zeus Sabazios&quot;. The Christian Clement of Alexandria had been informed that the secret mysteries of Sabazius, as practiced among the Romans, involved a serpent, a chthonic creature unconnected with the mounted skygod of Phrygia: God in the bosom&#x27; is a countersign of the mysteries of Sabazius to the adepts&quot;. Clement reports: &quot;This is a snake, passed through the bosom of the initiates&quot;.

Much later, the Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, &quot;Suda&quot; (), flatly states Sabazios ... is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry &quot;sabazein&quot;. Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry &quot;sabasmos&quot;; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call &quot;saboi&quot; those places that had been dedicated to him and his Bacchantes ... Demosthenes [in the speech] &quot;On Behalf of Ktesiphon&quot; [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.

In Roman sites, though an inscription built into the wall of the abbey church of San Venanzio at Ceperana suggested to a Renaissance humanist it had been built upon the foundations of a temple to &quot;Jupiter Sabazius&quot;, according to modern scholars not a single temple consecrated to Sabazius, the rider god of the open air, has been located. Small votive hands, typically made of copper or bronze, are often associated with the cult of Sabazios. Many of these hands have a small perforation at the base which suggests they may have been attached to wooden poles and carried in processions. The symbolism of these objects is not well known.

==Jewish connection==
The first Jews who settled in Rome were expelled in 139 BCE, along with Chaldaean astrologers by Cornelius Hispalus under a law which proscribed the propagation of the &quot;corrupting&quot; cult of &quot;Jupiter Sabazius&quot;, according to the epitome of a lost book of Valerius Maximus:
Gnaeus Cornelius Hispalus, praetor peregrinus in the year of the consulate of Marcus Popilius Laenas and Lucius Calpurnius, ordered the astrologers by an edict to leave Rome and Italy within ten days, since by a fallacious interpretation of the stars they perturbed fickle and silly minds, thereby making profit out of their lies. The same praetor compelled the Jews, who attempted to infect the Roman custom with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius, to return to their homes.

By this it is conjectured that the Romans identified the Jewish YHVH Tzevaot (&quot;sa-ba-oth&quot;, &quot;of the Hosts&quot;) as Jove Sabazius.

This possibly mistaken connection of Sabazios and Sabaot was often repeated. In a similar vein, Plutarch maintained that the Jews worshipped Dionysus, and that the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius. Plutarch also discusses the identification of the Jewish God with the &quot;Egyptian&quot; Typhon, an identification which he later rejects, however. The monotheistic Hypsistarians worshipped the Most High under this name, which may have been a form of the Jewish God.

<doc id="316129" wikidata="Q160640" url="?curid=316129" title="Raymond Aron">
<text>Raymond Claude Ferdinand Aron (; ; 14 March 1905 – 17 October 1983) was a French philosopher, sociologist, political scientist, historian and journalist, one of France&#x27;s most prominent thinkers of the 20th century.

Aron is best known for his 1955 book &quot;The Opium of the Intellectuals&quot;, the title of which inverts Karl Marx&#x27;s claim that religion was the opium of the people; he argues that Marxism was the opium of the intellectuals in post-war France. In the book, Aron chastised French intellectuals for what he described as their harsh criticism of capitalism and democracy and their simultaneous defense of the actions of the communist governments of the East. Critic Roger Kimball suggests that &quot;Opium&quot; is &quot;a seminal book of the twentieth century&quot;. Aron is also known for his lifelong friendship, sometimes fractious, with philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. The saying &quot;Better be wrong with Sartre than right with Aron&quot; became popular among French intellectuals.

Considered by many as a voice of moderation in politics, Aron had many disciples on both the political left and right; he remarked that he personally was &quot;more of a left-wing Aronian than a right-wing one&quot;. Aron wrote extensively on a wide range of other topics. Citing the breadth and quality of Aron&#x27;s writings, historian James R. Garland suggests, &quot;Though he may be little known in America, Raymond Aron arguably stood as the preeminent example of French intellectualism for much of the twentieth century.&quot;

==Life and career==
Born in Paris, the son of a secular Jewish lawyer, Aron studied at the École Normale Supérieure, where he met Jean-Paul Sartre, who became his friend and later his lifelong intellectual opponent. He was a rational humanist, and a leader among those who did not embrace existentialism. Aron took first place in the &quot;agrégation&quot; of philosophy in 1928, the year Sartre failed the same exam. In 1930, he received a doctorate in the philosophy of history from the École Normale Supérieure.

He had been teaching social philosophy at the University of Toulouse for only a few weeks when World War II began; he joined the Armée de l&#x27;Air. When France was defeated, he left for London to join the Free French forces, editing the newspaper, &quot;France Libre&quot; (Free France).

When the war ended Aron returned to Paris to teach sociology at the École Nationale d&#x27;Administration and Sciences Po. From 1955 to 1968, he taught at the Sorbonne, and after 1970 at the Collège de France as well as the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS). In 1953, he befriended the young American philosopher Allan Bloom, who was teaching at the Sorbonne.

A lifelong journalist, Aron in 1947 became an influential columnist for &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, a position he held for thirty years until he joined &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, where he wrote a political column up to his death.

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960 and an International member of the American Philosophical Society in 1966.

In 1978 he founded &quot;Commentaire&quot;, a quarterly journal of ideas and debate, together with Jean-Claude Casanova who was the venture&#x27;s founding director.

Aron died of a heart attack in Paris on 17 October 1983.

==Political commitment==
In Berlin, Aron witnessed the rise to power of the Nazi Party and developed an aversion to all totalitarian systems. In 1938, he participated in the Colloque Walter Lippmann in Paris. By the 1950s, he had grown very critical of the Austrian School and described their obsession with private property as an &quot;inverted Marxism&quot;. Aron always promoted an &quot;immoderately moderate&quot; form of liberalism which accepted a mixed economy as the normal economic model of the age.

==Political thought==
Aron is the author of books on Karl Marx and on Carl von Clausewitz. In &quot;Peace and War&quot;, he set out a theory of international relations. He argues that Max Weber&#x27;s claim that the state has a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force does not apply to the relationship between states.

In the field of international relations in the 1950s, Aron hypothesized that despite the advent of nuclear weapons, nations would still require conventional military forces. The usefulness of such forces would be made necessary by what he called a &quot;nuclear taboo.&quot;

<doc id="316130" wikidata="Q313868" url="?curid=316130" title="Fela Kuti">
<text>Fela Aníkúlápó Kútì (born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti; 15 October 1938 – 2 August 1997) was a Nigerian musician and political activist. He is regarded as the principal innovator of Afrobeat, a Nigerian music genre that combines West African music with American funk and jazz. At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa&#x27;s most &quot;challenging and charismatic music performers&quot;. AllMusic described him as &quot;a musical and sociopolitical voice&quot; of international significance.

Kuti was the son of Nigerian women&#x27;s rights activist Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. After early experiences abroad, he and his band Africa &#x27;70 (featuring drummer and musical director Tony Allen) shot to stardom in Nigeria during the 1970s, during which he was an outspoken critic and target of Nigeria&#x27;s military juntas. In 1970, he founded the Kalakuta Republic commune, which declared itself independent from military rule. The commune was destroyed in a 1978 raid that injured Kuti and his mother. He was jailed by the government of Muhammadu Buhari in 1984, but released after 20 months. He continued to record and perform through the 1980s and 1990s. Since his death in 1997, reissues and compilations of his music have been overseen by his son, Femi Kuti.

==Life and career==
=== Early life ===
Kuti was born into the Ransome-Kuti family, an upper-middle-class family, on 15 October 1938, in Abeokuta, Colonial Nigeria. His mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was an anti-colonial feminist, and his father, Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican minister, school principal, and the first president of the Nigeria Union of Teachers. Kuti&#x27;s parents both played active roles in the anti-colonial movement in Nigeria, most notably the Abeokuta Women&#x27;s Riots which was led by his mother in 1946. His brothers Beko Ransome-Kuti and Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, both medical doctors, were well known nationally. Kuti is a cousin to the writer and laureate Wole Soyinka, a Nobel Prize for Literature winner. They are both descendants of Josiah Ransome-Kuti, who is Kuti&#x27;s paternal grandfather and Soyinka&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather.

Kuti attended Abeokuta Grammar School. In 1958, he was sent to London to study medicine but decided to study music instead at the Trinity College of Music, with the trumpet being his preferred instrument. While there, he formed the band Koola Lobitos and played a fusion of jazz and highlife. The ensemble would include members, Bayo Martins on drums and Wole Bucknor on piano. In 1960, Kuti married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor, with whom he had three children (Yeni, Femi, and Sola). In 1963, Kuti moved back to the newly independent Federation of Nigeria, re-formed Koola Lobitos, and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. He played for some time with Victor Olaiya and his All-Stars.

He called his style Afrobeat, a combination of Apala, funk, jazz, highlife, salsa, calypso, and traditional Yoruba music. In 1969, Kuti took the band to the United States and spent ten months in Los Angeles. While there, he discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now known as Sandra Izsadore or Sandra Akanke Isidore), a partisan of the Black Panther Party. This experience heavily influenced his music and political views. He renamed the band Nigeria 70. Soon after, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was tipped off by a promoter that Kuti and his band were in the US without work permits. The band performed a quick recording session in Los Angeles that would later be released as &quot;The &#x27;69 Los Angeles Sessions&quot;.

===1970s===
After Kuti and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed (the) Africa &#x27;70 as lyrical themes changed from love to social issues. He formed the Kalakuta Republic—a commune, recording studio, and home for many people connected to the band—which he later declared independent from the Nigerian state.

Kuti set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel. He first named the Afro-Spot and later the Afrika Shrine, where he performed regularly and officiated at personalised Yoruba traditional ceremonies in honor of his native ancestral faith. He also changed his name to Anikulapo (meaning &quot;He who carries death in his pouch&quot;, with the interpretation: &quot;I will be the master of my own destiny and will decide when it is time for death to take me&quot;). He stopped using the hyphenated surname &quot;Ransome&quot; because he considered it a slave name.

Kuti&#x27;s music was popular among the Nigerian public and Africans in general. He decided to sing in Pidgin English so that individuals all over Africa could enjoy his music, where the local languages they speak are diverse and numerous. As popular as Kuti&#x27;s music had become in Nigeria and elsewhere, it was unpopular with the ruling government, and raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. During 1972, Ginger Baker recorded &quot;Stratavarious,&quot; with Kuti appearing alongside vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench. Around this time, Kuti became even more involved with the Yoruba religion.

In 1977, Kuti and Africa 70 released the album &quot;Zombie&quot;, which heavily criticized Nigerian soldiers, and used the zombie metaphor to describe the Nigerian military&#x27;s methods. The album was a massive success and infuriated the government, who raided the Kalakuta Republic with 1,000 soldiers. During the raid, Kuti was severely beaten, and his elderly mother (the first woman to drive a car in Nigeria) was fatally injured after being thrown from a window. The commune was burnt down, and Kuti&#x27;s studio, instruments, and master tapes were destroyed. Kuti claimed that he would have been killed had it not been for a commanding officer&#x27;s intervention as he was being beaten. Kuti&#x27;s response to the attack was to deliver his mother&#x27;s coffin to the Dodan Barracks in Lagos, General Olusegun Obasanjo&#x27;s residence, and to write two songs, &quot;Coffin for Head of State&quot; and &quot;Unknown Soldier,&quot; referencing the official inquiry that claimed an unknown soldier had destroyed the commune.

Kuti and his band took up residence in Crossroads Hotel after the Shrine had been destroyed along with the commune. In 1978, he married 27 women, many of whom were dancers, composers, and singers with whom he worked. The marriages served not only to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic but also to protect Kuti and his wives from authorities&#x27; false claims that Kuti was kidnapping women. Later, he adopted a rotation system of maintaining 12 simultaneous wives. There were also two concerts in the year: the first was in Accra, in which rioting broke out during the song &quot;Zombie&quot;, which caused Kuti to be banned from entering Ghana; the second was after the Berlin Jazz Festival when most of Kuti&#x27;s musicians deserted him due to rumours that he planned to use all of the proceeds to fund his presidential campaign.

In 1978 Fela performed at the Berliner Jazztage in Berlin with his band Africa 70. Disappointed by their fees, Tony Allen, the band leader and almost all the musicians resigned. Since then, Baryton player Lekan Animashaun became band leader and Fela created a new group named Egypt 80. In 1979, Kuti formed his political party, which he called Movement of the People (MOP), to &quot;clean up society like a mop&quot;, but it quickly became inactive due to his confrontations with the government of the day. MOP preached Nkrumahism and Africanism.

===1980s and beyond===

In 1980 Fela signed an exclusive management with French producer Martin Meissonnier who secured a record deal with Arista records London through A&amp;R Tarquin Gotch. The first album came out in February 1981 under the title of &quot;Black President&quot; with the track &quot;ITT&quot; and on the B-Side &quot;Colonial Mentality&quot; and an edited version of &quot;Sorrow Tears and Blood&quot; (these two tracks recorded with Africa 70 and Tony Allen were unreleased in Europe). 
Following the release, Fela performed his first European tour 
(4 concerts in a week) with a suite of 70 people. The tour starting in Paris on March 15, 1981, with a huge crowd estimated at 10000 people, then Brussels, Wien and Strasbourg. &quot;Black President was followed by another album was recorded in Paris in july 1981: &quot;Original Sufferhead&quot;, with &quot;Power Show&quot; on the B-side. Fela also recorded the track &quot;Perambulator&quot; in Paris. 
Arista gave his back freedom to Fela at the end of 1981.
French Filmmaker Jean Jacques Flori came to Lagos early 1982 to direct the now classic film &quot;Music is a Weapon&quot;. The filmed was broadcast first on Antenne 2 (french TV in 1982). The film producer Stephane Tchalgaldjieff didn&#x27;t like the film and decided to re edit it for an international release. &quot;V.I.P. (Vagabonds in Power)&quot; and &quot;Authority Stealing&quot; were released in 1980, with the former being a live performance done in Berlin, West Germany.

In 1983, Kuti nominated himself for president in Nigeria&#x27;s first elections in decades, but his candidature was refused. At this time, Kuti created a new band, Egypt 80, which reflected the view that Egyptian civilization, knowledge, philosophy, mathematics, and religious systems are African and must be claimed as such. Kuti stated in an interview: &quot;Stressing the point that I have to make Africans aware of the fact that Egyptian civilization belongs to the African. So that was the reason why I changed the name of my band to Egypt 80.&quot; Kuti continued to record albums and tour the country. He further infuriated the political establishment by implicating ITT Corporation&#x27;s vice-president, Moshood Abiola, and Obasanjo in the popular 25-minute political screed entitled &quot;I.T.T. (International Thief-Thief)&quot;.

In 1984, Muhammadu Buhari&#x27;s government, of which Kuti was a vocal opponent, jailed him on a charge of currency smuggling. Amnesty International and others denounced the charges as politically motivated. Amnesty designated him a prisoner of conscience, and other human rights groups also took up his case. After 20 months, General Ibrahim Babangida released him from prison. On his release, Kuti divorced his 12 remaining wives, citing &quot;marriage brings jealousy and selfishness&quot; since his wives would regularly compete for superiority.

Kuti continued to release albums with Egypt 80 and toured in the United States and Europe while continuing to be politically active. In 1986, he performed in Giants Stadium in New Jersey as part of Amnesty International&#x27;s A Conspiracy of Hope concert along with Bono, Carlos Santana, and the Neville Brothers. In 1989, Kuti and Egypt 80 released the anti-apartheid album &quot;Beasts of No Nation&quot; that depicted U.S. President Ronald Reagan, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and South African State President Pieter Willem Botha on its cover. The title of the composition evolved out of a statement by Botha: &quot;This uprising [against the apartheid system] will bring out the beast in us.&quot;

Kuti&#x27;s album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually, he ceased releasing albums altogether. On 21 January 1993, he and four members of Africa 70 were arrested and were later charged on 25 January for the murder of an electrician. Rumours also speculated that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment. However, there had been no confirmed statement from Kuti about this speculation.

=== Death ===
On 3 August 1997, Kuti&#x27;s brother Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, announced that Kuti had died on the previous day from complications related to AIDS. Kuti had been an AIDS denialist, and his widow maintained that he did not die of AIDS. His youngest son Seun took the role of leading Kuti&#x27;s former band Egypt 80. , the band is still active, releasing music under the moniker Seun Kuti &amp; Egypt 80&quot;.&quot;

==Music==
=== Music ===
Kuti&#x27;s musical style is called Afrobeat. It is a style he largely created, and is a complex fusion of jazz, funk, highlife, and traditional Nigerian and African chants and rhythms. It contains elements of psychedelic soul and has similarities to James Brown&#x27;s music. Afrobeat also borrows heavily from the native &quot;tinker pan&quot;. Tony Allen, Kuti&#x27;s drummer of twenty years, was instrumental in the creation of Afrobeat. Kuti once stated that &quot;there would be no Afrobeat without Tony Allen&quot;. Tony Allen&#x27;s drumming notably makes sparing use of 2 &amp; 4 backbeat style playing, instead opting for outlining the time in shuffling hard-bop fashion, while maintaining a strong downbeat. There are clear audible musical similarities between Kuti&#x27;s compositions and the work of electric-era Miles Davis, Sly Stone and Afrofunk pioneer Orlando Julius. 

Kuti&#x27;s band was notable for featuring two baritone saxophones when most groups only used one. This is a common technique in African and African-influenced musical styles and can be seen in funk and hip hop. His bands sometimes performed with two bassists at the same time both playing interlocking melodies and rhythms. There were always two or more guitarists. The electric West African style guitar in Afrobeat bands is a key part of the sound, and is used to give basic structure, playing a repeating chordal/melodic statement, riff, or groove.

Some elements often present in Kuti&#x27;s music are the call-and-response within the chorus and figurative but simple lyrics. His songs were also very long, at least 10–15 minutes in length, and many reached 20 or 30 minutes, while some unreleased tracks would last up to 45 minutes when performed live. Their length was one of many reasons that his music never reached a substantial degree of popularity outside Africa. His LP records frequently had one 30-minute track per side. Typically there is an &quot;instrumental introduction&quot; jam section of the song roughly 10–15 minutes long before Kuti starts singing the &quot;main&quot; part of the song, featuring his lyrics and singing, for another 10–15 minutes. On some recordings, his songs are divided into two parts: Part 1 being the instrumental, and Part 2 adding in vocals.

Kuti&#x27;s songs are mostly sung in Nigerian Pidgin English, although he also performed a few songs in the Yoruba language. His main instruments were the saxophone and the keyboards, but he also played the trumpet, electric guitar, and the occasional drum solo. Kuti refused to perform songs again after he had already recorded them, which hindered his popularity outside Africa.

The subject of Kuti&#x27;s songs tended to be very complex. They regularly challenged common received notions in the manner of political commentary through song. Many of his songs also expressed a form of parody and satire. The main theme he conveyed through his music was the search for justice through exploration of political and social topics that affected the common people.

=== Showmanship ===
Kuti was known for his showmanship, and his concerts were often outlandish and wild. He referred to his stage act as the &quot;Underground Spiritual Game&quot;. Many expected him to perform shows like those in the Western world, but during the 1980s, he was not interested in putting on a &quot;show&quot;. His European performance was a representation of what was relevant at the time and his other inspirations. He attempted to make a movie but lost all the materials to the fire that was set to his house by the military government in power. He thought that art, and thus his own music, should have political meaning.

Kuti&#x27;s concerts also regularly involved female singers and dancers, later dubbed as &quot;Queens.&quot; The Queens were women who helped influence the popularization of his music. They were dressed colorfully and wore makeup all over their bodies that expressed their visual creativity. The singers of the group played a backup role for Kuti, usually echoing his words or humming along, while the dancers would put on a performance of an erotic manner. This began to spark controversy due to the nature of their involvement with Kuti&#x27;s political tone, along with the reality that a lot of the women were young.

Kuti was part of an Afrocentric consciousness movement that was founded on and delivered through his music. In an interview included in Hank Bordowitz&#x27;s &quot;Noise of the World&quot;, Kuti stated:Music is supposed to have an effect. If you&#x27;re playing music and people don&#x27;t feel something, you&#x27;re not doing shit. That&#x27;s what African music is about. When you hear something, you must move. I want to move people to dance, but also to think. Music wants to dictate a better life, against a bad life. When you&#x27;re listening to something that depicts having a better life, and you&#x27;re not having a better life, it must have an effect on you.

==Political views and activism==

=== Activism ===
Kuti was highly engaged in political activism in Africa from the 1970s until his death. He criticized the corruption of Nigerian government officials and the mistreatment of Nigerian citizens. He spoke of colonialism as the root of the socio-economic and political problems that plagued the African people. Corruption was one of the worst political problems facing Africa in the 1970s and Nigeria was among the most corrupt countries. Its government rigged elections and performed coups that ultimately worsened poverty, economic inequality, unemployment, and political instability, further promoting corruption and crime. Kuti&#x27;s protest songs covered themes inspired by the realities of corruption and socio-economic inequality in Africa. Kuti&#x27;s political statements could be heard throughout Africa.

Kuti&#x27;s open vocalization of the violent and oppressive regime controlling Nigeria did not come without consequence. He was arrested on over 200 different occasions and spent time in jail, including his longest stint of 20 months after his arrest in 1984. On top of jail time, the corrupt government sent soldiers to beat Kuti, his family and friends, and destroy wherever he lived and whatever instruments or recordings he had.

In the 1970s, Kuti began to run outspoken political columns in the advertising space of daily and weekly newspapers such as &quot;The Daily Times&quot; and &quot;The Punch&quot;, bypassing editorial censorship in Nigeria&#x27;s predominantly state-controlled media. Published throughout the 1970s and early 1980s under the title &quot;Chief Priest Say&quot;, these columns were extensions of Kuti&#x27;s famous Yabi Sessions—consciousness-raising word-sound rituals, with himself as chief priest, conducted at his Lagos nightclub. Organized around a militantly Afrocentric rendering of history and the essence of black beauty, &quot;Chief Priest Say&quot; focused on the role of cultural hegemony in the continuing subjugation of Africans. Kuti addressed many topics, from fierce denunciations of the Nigerian Government&#x27;s criminal behavior, Islam and Christianity&#x27;s exploitative nature, and evil multinational corporations; to deconstructions of Western medicine, Black Muslims, sex, pollution, and poverty. &quot;Chief Priest Say&quot; was eventually canceled by &quot;The Daily Times&quot; and &quot;The Punch&quot;. Many have speculated that the paper&#x27;s editors were pressured to stop publication, including threats of violence.

=== Political views ===
Kuti&#x27;s lyrics expressed his inner thoughts. His rise in popularity throughout the 1970s signalled a change in the relation between music as an art form and Nigerian socio-political discourse. In 1984, he critiqued and insulted the authoritarian then-president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari. &quot;Beast of No Nation&quot;, one of his most popular songs, refers to Buhari as an &quot;animal in a madman&#x27;s body&quot;; in Nigerian Pidgin: &quot;No be outside Buhari dey ee / na craze man be dat / animal in craze man skini.&quot; Kuti strongly believed in Africa and always preached peace among its people. He thought the most important way for them to fight European cultural imperialism was to support traditional religions and lifestyles in their continent. The American Black Power movement also influenced Kuti&#x27;s political views; he supported Pan-Africanism and socialism and called for a united, democratic African republic. African leaders he supported during his lifetime include Kwame Nkrumah and Thomas Sankara. Kuti was a candid supporter of human rights, and many of his songs are direct attacks against dictatorships, specifically the militaristic governments of Nigeria in the 1970s and 1980s. He also criticized fellow Africans (especially the upper class) for betraying traditional African culture.

In 1978 Kuti became a polygamist when he simultaneously married 27 women. The highly publicized wedding served many purposes: it marked the one-year anniversary of Kuti and his wives surviving the Nigerian government&#x27;s attack on the Kalakuta Republic in 1977, and also formalized Kuti&#x27;s relationships with the women living with him; this legal status prevented the Nigerian government from raiding Kuti&#x27;s compound on the grounds that Kuti had kidnapped the women. Kuti also described polygamy as logical and convenient: &quot;A man goes for many women in the first place. Like in Europe, when a man is married when the wife is sleeping, he goes out and sleeps around. He should bring the women in the house, man, to live with him, and stop running around the streets!&quot; Some characterize his views towards women as misogyny and typically cite songs like &quot;Mattress&quot; as further evidence. In a more complex example, he mocks African women&#x27;s aspiration to European standards of ladyhood while extolling the values of the market woman in &quot;Lady&quot;. However, Kuti also critiqued what he considered aberrant displays of African masculinity. In his songs &quot;J.J.D. (Johnny Just Drop)&quot; and &quot;Gentleman&quot;, Kuti mocks African men&#x27;s culturally and politically inappropriate adoption of European standards and declares himself &quot;African man: Original&quot;.

Kuti was also an outspoken critic of the United States. At a meeting during his 1981 Amsterdam tour, he &quot;complained about the psychological warfare that American organizations like ITT and the CIA waged against developing nations in terms of language&quot;. Because terms such as Third World, undeveloped, or non-aligned countries imply inferiority, Kuti felt they should not be used.

== Legacy ==

Kuti is remembered as an influential icon who voiced his opinions on matters that affected the nation through his music. Since 1998, the Felabration festival, an idea pioneered by his daughter Yeni Kuti, is held each year at the New Afrika Shrine to celebrate the life of this music legend and his birthday. Since Kuti&#x27;s death in 1997, there has been a revival of his influence in music and popular culture, culminating in another re-release of his catalog controlled by UMG, Broadway, and off-Broadway shows, and new bands, such as Antibalas, who carry the Afrobeat banner to a new generation of listeners.

In 1999, Universal Music France, under Francis Kertekian, remastered the 45 albums that it owned and released them on 26 compact discs. These titles were licensed globally, except in Nigeria and Japan, where other companies owned Kuti&#x27;s music. In 2005, the American operations of UMG licensed all of its world-music titles to the UK-based label Wrasse Records, which repackaged the same 26 discs for distribution in the United States (where they replaced the titles issues by MCA) and the UK. In 2009, Universal created a new deal for the US and Europe, with Knitting Factory Records and PIAS respectively, which included the release of the Broadway cast recording of the musical &quot;Fela!&quot; In 2013, FKO Ltd., the entity that owned the rights to all of Kuti&#x27;s compositions, was acquired by BMG Rights Management.

In 2003, the &quot;Black President&quot; exhibition debuted at the New Museum for Contemporary Art, New York, and featured concerts, symposia, films, and 39 international artists&#x27; works.

American singer Bilal recorded a remake of Kuti&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Sorrow Tears and Blood&quot; for his second album, &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, featuring a guest rap by Common. Bilal cited Kuti&#x27;s mix of jazz and folk tastes as an influence on his music.

The 2007 film &quot;The Visitor&quot;, directed by Thomas McCarthy, depicted a disconnected professor (Richard Jenkins) who wanted to play the djembe; he learns from a young Syrian (Haaz Sleiman) who tells the professor he will never truly understand African music unless he listens to Fela. The film features clips of Kuti&#x27;s &quot;Open and Close&quot; and &quot;&quot;Je&#x27;nwi Temi&quot; (Don&#x27;t Gag Me)&quot;.

In 2008, an off-Broadway production about Kuti&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;Fela!&quot; and inspired by the 1982 biography &quot;Fela, Fela! This Bitch of a Life&quot; by Carlos Moore, began with a collaborative workshop between the Afrobeat band Antibalas and Tony award-winner Bill T. Jones. The production was a massive success, and sold-out performances during its run and gained critical acclaim. On 22 November 2009, &quot;Fela!&quot; began a run on Broadway at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre. Jim Lewis helped co-write the script (along with Jones) and obtained producer backing from Jay-Z and Will Smith, among others. On 4 May 2010, &quot;Fela!&quot; was nominated for 11 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical, Best Direction of a Musical for Bill T. Jones, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Sahr Ngaujah, and Best Featured Actress in a Musical for Lillias White. In 2011, the London production of &quot;Fela!&quot; (staged at the Royal National Theatre) was filmed. On 11 June 2012, it was announced that &quot;Fela!&quot; would return to Broadway for 32 performances.

On 18 August 2009, DJ J.Period released a free mixtape to the general public, entitled &quot;The Messengers&quot;. It is a collaboration with Somali-born hip-hop artist K&#x27;naan paying tribute to Kuti, Bob Marley, and Bob Dylan.

Two months later, Knitting Factory Records began re-releasing the 45 titles controlled by UMG, starting with yet another re-release in the US of the compilation &quot;The Best of the Black President&quot;, which was completed and released in 2013.

&quot;Fela Son of Kuti: The Fall of Kalakuta&quot; is a stage play written by Onyekaba Cornel Best in 2010. It has had triumphant acclaim as part of that year&#x27;s Felabration and returned in 2014 at the National Theatre and Freedom Park in Lagos. The play deals with events in a hideout, a day after the fall of Kalakuta.

The full-length documentary film &quot;Finding Fela&quot;, directed by Alex Gibney, premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.
A biographical film by Focus Features, directed by Steve McQueen and written by Biyi Bandele, was rumoured to be in production in 2010, with Chiwetel Ejiofor in the lead role. However, by 2014, the proposal was no longer produced under Focus Features, and while he maintained his role as the main writer, McQueen was replaced by Andrew Dosunmu as the director. McQueen told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that the film was &quot;dead&quot;.

The 2019 documentary film &quot;My Friend Fela&quot; (&quot;Meu amigo Fela&quot;) by Joel Zito Araújo, explores the complexity of Kuti&#x27;s life &quot;through the eyes and conversations&quot; of his biographer Carlos Moore.

The collaborative jazz/afrobeat album &quot;Rejoice&quot; by Tony Allen and Hugh Masekela, released in 2020, includes the track &quot;Never (Lagos Never Gonna Be the Same)&quot;, a tribute to Kuti, through whom Allen and Masekela first met in the 1970s.

Kuti&#x27;s songs &quot;Zombie&quot; &amp; &quot;Sorrow Tears and Blood&quot; has appeared in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: IV&quot;, and he was posthumously nominated to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2021.

In 2021, Hulu released a six-episode documentary miniseries, &quot;McCartney 3,2,1&quot;, in which Paul McCartney is quoted as saying of a visit to see Fela Kuti at the African Shrine, Kuti&#x27;s club outside of Lagos, in the early 1970s: &quot;The music was so incredible that I wept. Hearing that was one of the greatest music moments of my life.&quot;

On 1 November 2021, a blue plaque was unveiled by the Nubian Jak Community Trust at 12 Stanlake Road, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, where Kuti first lived when he came to London in 1958 and was studying music at Trinity College. The event included tributes from Kuti&#x27;s daughter Shalewa Ransome-Kuti, Resonance FM broadcaster Debbie Golt, Kuti&#x27;s former manager Rikki Stein, cover artist Lemi Ghariokwu, and others.

In 2022, Kuti was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Kuti at number 188 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>Charlyn Marie &quot;Chan&quot; Marshall ( ; born January 21, 1972), better known by her stage name Cat Power, is an American singer-songwriter. Cat Power was originally the name of her first band, but has become her stage name as a solo artist.

Born in Atlanta, Marshall was raised throughout the southern United States and began performing in local bands in Atlanta in the early 1990s. After opening for Liz Phair in 1993, she worked with Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth and Tim Foljahn of Two Dollar Guitar, with whom she recorded her first two albums, &quot;Dear Sir&quot; (1995) and &quot;Myra Lee&quot; (1996), on the same day in 1994. In 1996, she signed with Matador Records, and released a third album of new material with Shelley and Foljahn, &quot;What Would the Community Think&quot;. Following this, she released the critically acclaimed &quot;Moon Pix&quot; (1998), recorded with members of Dirty Three, and &quot;The Covers Record&quot; (2000), a collection of sparsely arranged cover songs.

After a brief hiatus she released &quot;You Are Free&quot; (2003), featuring guest musicians Dave Grohl and Eddie Vedder, followed by the soul-influenced &quot;The Greatest&quot; (2006), recorded with numerous Memphis studio musicians. A second album of cover tracks, &quot;Jukebox&quot;, was released in 2008. In 2012 she released the self-produced &quot;Sun&quot;, which debuted at number 10 on the Billboard 200, the highest-charting album of her career to date.

Critics have noted the constant evolution of Cat Power&#x27;s sound, with a mix of punk, folk and blues on her earliest albums, and elements of soul and other genres more prevalent in her later material.

==Early life==
Charlyn Marie Marshall was born January 21, 1972, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second child of Charlie Marshall, a blues musician and pianist, and Myra Lee Marshall ( Russell). She has one older sister, Miranda (&quot;Mandy&quot;). Her maternal grandfather was of Native American ancestry. Her parents divorced in 1979 and remarried shortly thereafter. Her mother remarried and had a son, Lenny, and the family traveled around often because of her stepfather&#x27;s profession.

Marshall attended ten different schools throughout the Southern U.S. in Greensboro; Bartlett and Memphis and throughout Georgia and South Carolina. At times she was left in the care of her grandmother. She was not allowed to buy records when she was growing up, but she listened to her stepfather&#x27;s record collection, which included artists Otis Redding, Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Rolling Stones, as well as her parents&#x27; records, which included Black Flag, Sister Sledge, and Barry White. In sixth grade, she adopted the nickname Chan (pronounced &quot;Shawn&quot;), which she would later use professionally. When she was 13, she listened to the Smiths, the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. She had to save up to buy cassettes and the first one she got was a record by the Misfits. As a high schooler in Atlanta, she saw shows by punk bands including a Cramps show at which the Flat Duo Jets opened. She has referenced multiple times the influence of Dex Romweber from the Flat Duo Jets, and she bought her first guitar because it looked like his black and white Silvertone. At age 16, Marshall dropped out of high school and became estranged from her mother, having no further contact with her until she was 24.

Religion was a large part of Marshall&#x27;s upbringing; her father was a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, though she attended Southern Baptist churches with her grandmother, where she began singing while learning hymns.

==Career==
===1992–1995: Beginnings===
Marshall&#x27;s first instrument was a 1950s Silvertone guitar, which she taught herself to play. While working in a pizzeria, she began playing music in Atlanta in the late-1980s with Glen Thrasher, Marc Moore, Damon Moore and Fletcher Liegerot, who would get together for jam sessions in a basement. The group were booked for a show and had to come up with a name quickly; after seeing a man wearing a Caterpillar trucker cap that read: &quot;Cat Diesel Power&quot;, Marshall chose Cat Power as the name of the band.

While in Atlanta, Marshall played her first live shows as support to her friends&#x27; bands, including Magic Bone and Opal Foxx Quartet. In a 2007 interview, she explained that the music itself was more experimental and that playing shows was often an opportunity for her and her friends &quot;to get drunk and take drugs&quot;. A number of her local peers became entrenched in heroin use. After the death of her boyfriend, and the subsequent loss of her best friend to AIDS, Marshall relocated to New York City in 1992 with Glen Thrasher. A new boyfriend helped her get a job in a restaurant.

Thrasher introduced her to New York&#x27;s free jazz and experimental music scene. After attending a concert by Anthony Braxton, she gave her first New York show of improvisational music at a warehouse in Brooklyn. One of her shows during this period was as the support act to Man or Astro-man? and consisted of her playing a two-string guitar and singing the word &quot;no&quot; for 15 minutes. Around this time, she met the band God Is My Co-Pilot, who assisted with the release of her first single, &quot;Headlights&quot;, in a limited run of 500 copies on their Making of Americans label.

Marshall recorded simultaneously her first two albums &quot;Dear Sir&quot; and &quot;Myra Lee&quot; in December 1994 in a small basement studio near Mott Street in New York City, with guitarist Tim Foljahn and Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley; Marshall and Shelley had initially met after she played a show opening for Liz Phair in 1993. A total of 20 songs were recorded in a single day by the trio, all of which were split into two records, making up &quot;Dear Sir&quot; and &quot;Myra Lee&quot;, released respectively in October 1995 and March 1996. Although &quot;Dear Sir&quot; is considered Marshall&#x27;s debut album, it is more the length of an EP.

===1996–2003: Early Matador releases===
In 1996, Marshall signed to Matador Records and in September released her third album, &quot;What Would the Community Think&quot;, which she recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, in February 1996. The album was produced by Shelley and again featured Shelley and Foljahn as backing musicians, and spawned a single and music video, &quot;Nude as the News&quot; about the abortion she had at the age of 20. Critics cited the album as evidence of her maturation as a singer and songwriter from the &quot;dense and cathartic&quot; material of her first two releases.

After the release of &quot;What Would the Community Think&quot;, Marshall took a trip to South Africa, after which she left New York City and moved to Portland, Oregon, where she found temporary employment as a babysitter. In the spring of 1997, Marshall relocated with her then-boyfriend, musician Bill Callahan, to a rural farmhouse in Prosperity, South Carolina. After experiencing a hypnogogic nightmare while alone in the farmhouse, Marshall wrote six new songs that would go on to make up the bulk of her following album, &quot;Moon Pix&quot; (1998), which she recorded at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne, Australia, with backing musicians Mick Turner and Jim White of the Australian band Dirty Three. &quot;Moon Pix&quot; was well received by critics, and along with an accompanying music video for the song &quot;Cross Bones Style&quot;, helped her gain further recognition. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would later describe it as her &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; record.

In 1999 Marshall performed in a series of shows where she provided musical accompaniment to the silent movie &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot;. The shows combined original material and covers, some of which would be released on Marshall&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Covers Record&quot; in 2000. The songs were recorded during two sessions in the summer of 1998 and fall of 1999. Additionally, she performed eleven covers during a Peel session broadcast on June 18, 2000, that included own interpretations of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Hard Times in New York Town&quot; and Oasis&#x27;s &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. Her contract with Matador for 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Covers Album&quot; reportedly consisted of a Post-it note signed by herself and the company&#x27;s founder.

During the early-2000s, Marshall was embraced by the fashion industry for her &quot;neo grunge&quot; look, and seen as a muse by designers Marc Jacobs and Nicolas Ghesquière. In 2001 she modeled in &quot;New York&quot; magazine″s fall fashion issue and was photographed by her friends Mark Borthwick and Katja Rahlwes, who featured her in &quot;Purple&quot; magazine alongside Catherine Deneuve.

In February 2003, Marshall released &quot;You Are Free&quot;, her first album of original material in five years. The album, which featured guest musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Dave Grohl, and Warren Ellis, became the first charting Cat Power album, reaching 105 on the Billboard 200. A music video directed by Brett Vapnek was released for the song &quot;He War&quot;. Marshall toured extensively through 2003 and 2004, playing shows in Europe, Brazil, the U.S. and Australia. During this period, Marshall&#x27;s live performances had become erratic and unpredictable, and a 2003 &quot;The New Yorker&quot; article suggested: &quot;It is foolhardy to describe a Cat Power event as a concert,&quot; citing &quot;rambling confessions&quot; and &quot;[talking] to a friend&#x27;s baby from the stage.&quot; Marshall later attributed this period to a drinking problem. Around the time of the release of &quot;You Are Free&quot;, Marshall purchased a house in South Beach, Miami.

===2004–2011: Mainstream success===
In October 2004, Matador released the DVD film &quot;Speaking for Trees&quot;, which featured a continuous, nearly two-hour static shot of Marshall performing with her guitar in a woodland. The set was accompanied by an audio CD containing the 18-minute song &quot;Willie Deadwilder&quot;, featuring M. Ward also on guitar.
On January 22, 2006, Marshall released her seventh album, &quot;The Greatest&quot;, a Southern soul-influenced album of new material featuring veteran Memphis studio musicians, including Mabon &quot;Teenie&quot; Hodges, Leroy Hodges, David Smith, and Steve Potts. The album debuted at 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and critics noted its relatively &quot;polished and accessible&quot; sound, predicting it was &quot;going to gain her a lot of new fans.&quot; &quot;The Greatest&quot; met with critical acclaim, and won the 2006 Shortlist Music Prize, making Marshall the first woman to win the honor. It was also named the number 6 best album of 2006 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine.

Simultaneously, Marshall collaborated with several other musicians on different projects, including Mick Collins on a recording of Ludwig Rellstab&#x27;s poem &quot;Auf Dem Strom&quot; for the film &quot;Wayne County Ramblin&quot;″; a duet with singer-model Karen Elson on an English cover of Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot; (2007); lead vocals on the Ensemble track &quot;Disown, Delete&quot;; and a reworked version of &quot;Revelations&quot; with Yoko Ono for Ono&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m a Witch&quot;.

In the fall of 2006, Marshall became a celebrity spokesperson for a line of jewelry from Chanel, after being seen by Karl Lagerfeld smoking a cigarette outside the Mercer Hotel in New York. Lagerfeld chose Cat Power for the soundtrack to his spring 2007 fashion show. He also photographed Marshall for a &quot;Purple&quot; feature.

In 2007, Marshall contributed songs to the soundtrack of Ethan Hawke&#x27;s film &quot;The Hottest State&quot;, recording with Jesse Harris and Terry Manning, and the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Juno&quot;. The same year, she made her feature film debut acting in &quot;My Blueberry Nights&quot; opposite Jude Law, appearing in a small role. She also appeared in the role of a postal worker in Doug Aitken&#x27;s MoMA installation &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;, which followed the nocturnal lives of five city dwellers. Also in 2007, she featured on Faithless&#x27; album track &quot;A Kind of Peace&quot;.
In January 2008, Marshall released her second covers album, &quot;Jukebox&quot;. Recorded with her recently assembled &quot;Dirty Delta Blues Band&quot;, which consisted of Judah Bauer from the Blues Explosion, Gregg Foreman of The Delta 72, Erik Paparazzi of Lizard Music and Jim White of Dirty Three, the album featured the original song &quot;Song to Bobby&quot;, Marshall&#x27;s tribute to Bob Dylan, and a reworking of the &quot;Moon Pix&quot; song &quot;Metal Heart&quot;. She also collaborated with Beck and producer Danger Mouse on the album &quot;Modern Guilt&quot; (2008): She contributed backing vocals to two tracks, &quot;Orphans&quot; and &quot;Walls&quot;. The album was released in July of that year.

In September 2008, Marshall and members of the Dirty Delta Blues (Erik Paparazzi and Gregg Foreman) recorded their version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot; for a Lincoln car commercial. In 2013, Cat Power&#x27;s version of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; was used in Apple&#x27;s Christmas commercial &quot;Misunderstood&quot;. In December 2008, she released &quot;Dark End of the Street&quot;, an EP consisting of songs left over from the &quot;Jukebox&quot; sessions. In 2009, she provided backing vocals on Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s cover of &quot;Hold On, Hold On&quot; by Neko Case on the 2009 album &quot;Easy Come Easy Go.&quot; In 2011, she also featured as guest vocalist on &quot;Tonight You Belong to Me&quot; on Eddie Vedder&#x27;s &quot;Ukulele Songs&quot;.

===2012–present: Recent activity===

In February 2012, Marshall cancelled a scheduled appearance in Tel Aviv, Israel, citing &quot;much confusion&quot; and that she felt &quot;sick in her spirit.&quot; She had faced calls to boycott the country over its conflict with Palestine. Two months later, she cancelled her appearance at the Coachella Music Festival, claiming that she &quot;didn&#x27;t think it was fair to play Coachella while my new album is not yet finished,&quot; also hinting that her forthcoming record is &quot;almost done&quot; and will see release later in 2012. Marshall&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Sun&quot;, was released in September 2012, after releasing the lead single &quot;Ruin&quot; as a free download the previous June. The album features prominent electronica elements and arrangements, which Marshall incorporated into the &quot;really slow guitar-based songs&quot; she had originally written. In a review published on September 4, 2012, on Consequence of Sound, &quot;Sun&quot; was praised as a unique album and received a four-star rating. In summation, reviewer Sarah Grant wrote that Marshall&#x27;s 2012 release is &quot;a passionate pop album of electronic music filtered through a singer-songwriter&#x27;s soul.&quot; The album debuted at a career chart-high of No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling over 23,000 copies on its opening week.

In July 2015, it was announced that Marshall would be providing narration for the documentary &quot;&quot; directed by Amy J. Berg, which revolves around the life of Janis Joplin and premiered at the 2015 Venice Film Festival. On television, Marshall starred on &quot;China, IL&quot;, in the hourlong musical special &quot;Magical Pet&quot;. Marshall performs three original songs written by creator Brad Neely.
On July 28, 2017, Marshall announced on Instagram that her tenth studio album was &quot;ready to go&quot;, although she did not disclose its title or expected release date.
On March 20, 2018, it was announced that Marshall would perform a &quot;Moon Pix&quot; 20th anniversary concert at Sydney Opera House, which occurred from May 25 to June 16 and featured album collaborators Jim White and Mick Turner.

After twenty-two years with Matador, Cat Power left them and signed with Domino records a year later for her 10th studio album, &quot;Wanderer,&quot; which was released in 2018&quot;.&quot; It was her first to not be released on Matador Records since 1996. According to Marshall, Matador were not happy with the recordings for Wanderer, they wanted her to rerecord it and make it sound more commercial. She released two more singles, &quot;Woman&quot; featuring Lana Del Rey on August 15 and a cover of Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Stay&quot; on September 18, before the album was released on October 5, 2018, through Domino Recording Company. She embarked on a world tour in promotion of the album in September.

Power embarked on a US arena tour in August 2021 supporting Alanis Morissette and Garbage. She was a last-minute addition to the lineup, after original opening act Liz Phair canceled her appearances. Power contributed four new songs to the soundtrack of the 2021 film &quot;Flag Day&quot;. Her eleventh studio album, &quot;Covers&quot;, was released on January 14, 2022, and was supported by a US tour.

Marshall released her first live album on November 10, 2023, &quot;Cat Power Sings Dylan: The 1966 Royal Albert Hall Concert&quot;. The album is a recreation of Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1966 concert at Manchester Free Trade Hall, although early bootlegs mislabeled the concert as being recorded at the Royal Albert Hall. In February 2024, Marshall embarked on a tour in support of the album, in which she will recreate Dylan&#x27;s 1966 performance at venues across the United States and Europe.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Marshall entered a relationship with actor Giovanni Ribisi, and resided with Ribisi and his daughter in Los Angeles. They also had a rental house in Malibu where she had a studio. Following the release of &quot;The Greatest&quot;, Marshall canceled her impending spring 2006 tour, and used the hiatus to recover from mental health problems. As part of her recovery, she was admitted to the psychiatric ward at Mount Sinai Medical Center &amp; Miami Heart Institute, leaving after a week. Marshall gave a first person account of her breakdown in an interview for the November 2006 issue of &quot;Spin.&quot;

In June 2012, it was reported that Marshall had ended her relationship with Ribisi, and the completion of her upcoming record had coincided with their breakup: &quot;I cut my hair off three days [after the breakup], got on a plane to France, and finished the shit.&quot; Shortly after the release of &quot;Sun&quot;, Marshall began having trouble breathing and was hospitalized multiple times, though doctors were unable to diagnose her. &quot;I thought I was dying,&quot; she recounted. &quot;They told me they were going to put me in a coma to save my lungs. My friend came to visit and told me I&#x27;d made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 and all I could think was: &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to die.&#x27;&quot; Marshall was subsequently diagnosed with hereditary angioedema, an immune disorder that causes sporadic swelling of the face and throat due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. In September 2012, she stated she had been hospitalized owing to the condition over eight times, which led her to cancel her European tour.

In April 2015, Marshall announced that she had recently given birth to a son, but did not name the child&#x27;s father. Since then, she has named James Concannon, an artist, as the child&#x27;s father on her Instagram account.

On June 5, 2023, she announced her sobriety via her Instagram account with a selfie and the message &quot;41 days sober. Don&#x27;t mess with her, she&#x27;s that girl...&quot;

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Marshall&#x27;s releases as Cat Power have frequently been noted by critics for their somber, blues-influenced instrumentation and melancholy lyrics, leading &quot;LA Weekly&quot; to dub her the &quot;queen of sadcore&quot;. Marshall, however, claims that her music is often misinterpreted, and that many of her songs are &quot;not sad, [but] triumphant&quot;. She has recounted blues, old soul music, British rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, as well as hymns and gospel music as being integral influences on her.

Cat Power&#x27;s early releases have been described as blending elements of punk, folk, and blues, while her later releases (post-2000) began to incorporate more sophisticated arrangements and production. &quot;The Greatest&quot; (2006), Marshall&#x27;s seventh release, was heavily soul-influenced and incorporated R&amp;B elements; the Memphis Rhythm Band provided backing instrumentation on the album. Unlike her previous releases, which featured sparse guitar and piano arrangements, &quot;The Greatest&quot; was described by Marshall biographer Sarah Goodman as her first &quot;full-blown studio record with sophisticated production and senior players backing [Marshall] up&quot;.

===Performances===

Marshall&#x27;s live shows have been known for their unpolished and often erratic nature, with songs beginning and ending abruptly or blending into one another without clear transitions. She has also cut short performances without explanation. On some occasions this has been attributed to stage fright and the influence of alcohol. Marshall spoke openly about suffering from severe bouts of stage fright, specifically in her early career, and admitted that her stage fright stemmed from issues regarding depression, alcoholism, and substance abuse.

By 2006, she had found new collaborators and had stopped drinking. Marshall&#x27;s performance style became more enthusiastic and professional; a review in &quot;Salon&quot; noted that she was &quot;delivering onstage&quot;, and called &quot;The Greatest&quot; &quot;polished and sweetly upbeat&quot;.

==Philanthropy and activism==
A live version of the gospel song &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;—culled from a performance with the Dirty Delta Blues band—was released on the charity compilation &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot;. Released by independent British label 4AD on February 17, 2009, the set benefited the Red Hot Organization, an international charity dedicated to raising funds and awareness for HIV and AIDS. She also appeared in a PETA ad, encouraging people to spay and neuter their pets.

On December 25, 2011, Marshall released a reworking of the &quot;What Would the Community Think&quot; track &quot;King Rides By&quot; for download from her official website, with all proceeds from sales of the track being donated to The Festival of Children Foundation and The Ali Forney Center. A music video directed by Giovanni Ribisi and featuring Filipino boxer and politician Manny Pacquiao was released to promote the song.

In 2014, she played a double benefit show in St. Louis for Ferguson activists, at which shirts by artist James Concannon were sold to also help raise money for jailed activists.

<text>Frumentius (; died c. 383) was a Phoenician Christian missionary and the first bishop of Axum who brought Christianity to the Kingdom of Aksum. He is sometimes known by other names, such as Abuna (&quot;Our Father&quot;) and Aba Salama (&quot;Father of Peace&quot;).

He was a native of Phoenicia, born in Tyre, modern day Lebanon. As a boy, he was captured with his brother on a voyage, and they became slaves to the King of Axum. He freed them shortly before his death, and they were invited to educate his young heir. They also began to teach Christianity in the region. Later, Frumentius traveled to Alexandria, Egypt, where he appealed to have a bishop appointed and missionary priests sent south to Axum. Thereafter, he was appointed bishop and established the Church in Ethiopia, converting many local people, as well as the king. His appointment began a tradition that the Patriarch of Alexandria appoint the bishops of Ethiopia.

==Biography==
According to the fourth-century historian Tyrannius Rufinus (x.9), who cites Frumentius&#x27; brother Edesius as his authority, as children (ca. 316) Frumentius and Edesius accompanied their uncle Meropius from their birthplace of Tyre (now in Lebanon) on a voyage to &#x27;India&#x27;. When their ship stopped at one of the harbors of the Red Sea, local people massacred the whole crew, sparing the two boys, who were taken as slaves to the King of Axum. The two boys soon gained the favor of the king, who raised them to positions of trust. Shortly before his death, the king freed them. The widowed queen, however, prevailed upon them to remain at the court and assist her in the education of the young heir, Ezana, and in the administration of the kingdom during the prince&#x27;s minority. They remained and (especially Frumentius) used their influence to spread Christianity. First they encouraged the Christian merchants present in the country to practice their faith openly, and they helped them find places &quot;where they could come together for prayer according to the Roman Rite&quot;; later they converted some of the natives.

When the prince came of age, Edesius returned to Tyre, where he stayed and was ordained a priest. Frumentius, eager for the conversion of Ethiopia, accompanied his brother as far as Alexandria, where he requested Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria, to send a bishop and some priests as missionaries to Ethiopia. By Athanasius&#x27; own account, he believed Frumentius to be the most suitable person for the job and consecrated him as bishop, traditionally in the year 328, or according to others, between 340 and 346.

Frumentius returned to Ethiopia, where he erected his episcopal see at Axum, then converted and baptized King Ezana, who built many churches and spread Christianity throughout Ethiopia. Frumentius established the first monastery of Ethiopia, called &quot;Dabba Selama&quot; in Dogu&#x27;a Tembien. The people called Frumentius Kesate Birhan (Revealer of Light) and Abba Salama (Father of Peace). He became the first &quot;Abune&quot;, a title given to the head of the Ethiopian Church.

In about 356, the Emperor Constantius II wrote to King Ezana and his brother Saizana, requesting them to replace Frumentius as bishop with Theophilos the Indian, who supported the Arian position, as did the emperor. Frumentius had been appointed by Athanasius, a leading opponent of Arianism. The king refused the request.

Ethiopian traditions credit him with the first Geʽez translation of the New Testament, and being involved in the development of Geʽez script from an abjad (consonantal-only) into an abugida (syllabic).

==Feast date==
The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church celebrate the feast of Abba Salama&#x27;s consecration on Taḫśaś (the 4th month of Ethiopian or Coptic calendar) 18 and departure Hamle (the 11th month of Ethiopian or Coptic calendar) 26.

The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria celebrates the feast of Frumentius on 18 December, the Eastern Orthodox Church on 30 November and the Catholic Church on 20 July.

==Patronage==
Frumentius is regarded as the patron saint of the former Kingdom of Aksum, and its contemporary territories.

He is the patron saint of St Frumentius Theological College, the Tigrayan Seminary in Ethiopia.

<doc id="316136" wikidata="Q325428" url="?curid=316136" title="Miroslav Krleža">
<text>Miroslav Krleža (; 7 July 1893 – 29 December 1981) was a Croatian writer who is widely considered to be the greatest Croatian writer of the 20th century. He wrote notable works in all the literary genres, including poetry (&quot;The Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh&quot;, 1936), theater (&quot;Messrs. Glembay&quot;, 1929), short stories (&quot;The Croatian God Mars&quot;, 1922), novels (&quot;The Return of Philip Latinowicz&quot;, 1932; &quot;On the Edge of Reason&quot;, 1938), and an intimate diary. His works often include themes of bourgeois hypocrisy and conformism in Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Krleža wrote numerous essays on problems of art, history, politics, literature, philosophy, and military strategy, and was known as one of the great polemicists of the century. His style combines visionary poetic language and sarcasm.

Krleža dominated the cultural life of Croatia and Yugoslavia for half a century. A &quot;Communist of his own making&quot;, he was criticized in Communist circles in the 1930s for his refusal to submit to the tenets of socialist realism. After the Second World War, he held various cultural posts in Socialist Yugoslavia, and was most notably the director of the Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute and a constant advisor on cultural affairs to President Tito. After the break with Stalin, his speech at the 1952 Congress of Yugoslav Writers signaled a new era of comparative freedom in Yugoslav literature.

==Biography==
Miroslav Krleža was born in Zagreb, the son of a constable. He enrolled in a preparatory military school in Pécs, modern-day Hungary. At that time, Pécs and Zagreb were within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Subsequently, he attended the Ludoviceum military academy at Budapest. He defected to Serbia, but was dismissed as a suspected spy. Upon his return to Croatia, he was demoted in the Austro-Hungarian army and sent as a common soldier to the Eastern front in World War I. In the post-World War I period, Krleža established himself both as a major Modernist writer and politically controversial figure in Yugoslavia, a newly created country which encompassed South Slavic lands of the former Habsburg Empire and the kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro.

Krleža was the driving force behind leftist literary and political reviews &quot;Plamen&quot; (&quot;The Flame&quot;, 1919), &quot;Književna republika&quot; (&quot;Literary Republic&quot;, 1923–1927), &quot;Danas&quot; (&quot;Today&quot;, 1934) and &quot;Pečat&quot; (&quot;Seal&quot;, 1939–1940). He became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1918, but was expelled in 1939 because of his unorthodox views on art, his opposition to Socialist realism, and his unwillingness to give open support to the Great Purge, after the long polemic now known as &quot;the Conflict on the Literary Left&quot;, pursued by Krleža alongside virtually every important writer in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, in the period between the two World Wars. The Party commissar sent to mediate between Krleža and other leftist and party journals was Josip Broz Tito.

After the establishment of the Nazi puppet Independent State of Croatia under Ante Pavelić, Krleža refused to join the Partisans headed by Tito. Following a brief period of social stigmatization after 1945, he was eventually rehabilitated. In 1947, he became vice-president of the Yugoslav Academy of Science and Arts in Zagreb and, from 1958 to 1961, he was president of the Yugoslav Writers&#x27; Union. During this time, Croatia&#x27;s principal state publishing house, Nakladni zavod Hrvatske, published his collected works. Supported by Tito, in 1950 Krleža founded the Yugoslav Institute for Lexicography, holding the position as its head until his death. The institute would be posthumously named after him and is now called the Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography.

From 1950 on, Krleža enjoyed the life of a high-profile writer and intellectual, often closely connected to Tito. He also held the post of president of the Yugoslav Writers&#x27; Union between 1958 and 1961. In 1962, he received the NIN Award for the novel (&quot;The Banners&quot;), and in 1968 the Herder Prize.

Following the deaths of Tito in May 1980 and Bela Krleža in April 1981, Krleža spent most of his last years in ill health. He was awarded the Laureate Of The International Botev Prize in 1981. He died in his Villa Gvozd in Zagreb on 29 December 1981 and was given a state funeral in Zagreb on 4 January 1982. In 1986, Villa Gvozd was donated to the City of Zagreb. It was opened to the public in 2001, but has been temporarily closed due to the 2020 Zagreb earthquake damage as of 2021.

==Works==

Krleža&#x27;s oeuvre can be divided into the following categories:

===Poetry===
Although Krleža&#x27;s lyric poetry is held in high regard, by common critical consensus his greatest poetic work is &quot;Balade Petrice Kerempuha&quot; (&quot;Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh&quot;), spanning more than five centuries and centred on the figure of plebeian prophet Petrica Kerempuh, a Croatian Till Eulenspiegel.

===Novels===
Krleža&#x27;s novelistic oeuvre consists of four works: &quot;The Return of Philip Latinowicz&quot;, &quot;On the Edge of Reason&quot;, &quot;The Banquet in Blitva&quot;, and &quot;The Banners&quot;. The first one is a novel about an artist. &quot;On the Edge of Reason&quot; and &quot;The Banquet in Blitva&quot; are satires (the latter located in an imaginary Baltic country and called a political poem), saturated with the atmosphere of all-pervasive totalitarianism, while &quot;The Banners&quot; has been dubbed a &quot;Croatian &quot;War and Peace&quot;&quot;. It is a multi-volume panoramic view of Croatian (and Central European) society before, during, and after World War I, revolving around the prototypical theme of fathers and sons in conflict. All Krleža&#x27;s novels except &quot;The Banners&quot;, have been translated into English.

===Short stories and novellas===
The most notable collection of Krleža&#x27;s short stories is the anti-war book &quot;Croatian God Mars&quot;, on the fates of Croatian soldiers sent to the World War I battlefields.

===Plays===
Krleža&#x27;s main artistic interest was centered on drama. He began with experimental expressionist plays like &quot;Adam i Eva&quot; and &quot;Michelangelo Buonarroti&quot;, dealing with defining passions of heroic figures, but eventually opted for more conventional naturalist plays. The best known is &quot;Gospoda Glembajevi&quot; (&quot;The Glembays&quot;), a cycle dealing with the decay of a bourgeois family. &quot;Golgota&quot; is another play, political in nature.

===Diaries and memoirs===
Krleža&#x27;s memoirs and diaries include &quot;Davni dani&quot; (&quot;Olden Days&quot;) and &quot;Djetinjstvo u Agramu&quot; (&quot;Childhood in Zagreb&quot;). Other works include &quot;Dnevnici&quot; (&quot;Diaries&quot;) and the posthumously published &quot;Zapisi iz Tržiča&quot; (&quot;Notes from Tržič&quot;) chronicle multifarious impressions.

<text>Hans Spemann (; 27 June 1869 – 9 September 1941) was a German embryologist who was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1935 for his student Hilde Mangold&#x27;s discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, an influence, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs, one of the first steps towards cloning. Spemann added his name as an author to Hilde Mangold&#x27;s dissertation (although she objected) and won a Nobel Prize for her work.

==Biography==
Hans Spemann was born in Stuttgart, the eldest son of publisher Wilhelm Spemann and his wife Lisinka, née Hoffman. After he left school in 1888 he spent a year in his father&#x27;s business, then, in 1889–1890, he did military service in the Kassel Hussars followed by a short time as a bookseller in Hamburg. In 1891 he entered the University of Heidelberg where he studied medicine, taking his preliminary examination in 1893. There he met the biologist and psychologist Gustav Wolff who had begun experiments on the embryological developments of newts and shown that, if the lens of a developing newt&#x27;s eye is removed, it regenerates.

In 1892 Spemann married Klara Binder with whom he had a daughter (Margaret) and three sons (Fritz, Rudolph, Ulrich). In 1893–1894 he moved to the University of Munich for clinical training but decided, rather than becoming a clinician, to move to the Zoological Institute at the University of Würzburg, where he remained as a lecturer until 1908. His degree in zoology, botany, and physics, awarded in 1895, followed study under Theodor Boveri, Julius von Sachs and Wilhelm Röntgen.

For his Ph.D. thesis under Boveri, Spemann studied cell lineage in the parasitic worm &quot;Strongylus paradoxus&quot;, for his teaching diploma, the development of the middle ear in the frog. Spemann advocated a holistic approach to biology.

==Experiments in ontogeny==

During the winter of 1896, while quarantined in a sanitarium recovering from tuberculosis, Spemann read August Weismann&#x27;s book &quot;The Germ Plasm: A Theory of Heredity&quot;. He wrote in his autobiography: &quot;I found here a theory of heredity and development elaborated with uncommon perspicacity to its ultimate consequences...This stimulated experimental work of my own&quot;.

Results in embryology had been contradictory: in 1888 Wilhelm Roux, who had introduced the experimental manipulation of the embryo to discover the rules of development, performed a series of experiments in which he inserted a hot needle into one of two blastomeres to kill it. He then observed how the remaining blastomere developed, and found that it became a half embryo. In 1892 Hans Driesch performed similar experiments on sea urchin embryos, but instead of killing one of the two blastomeres he put many embryos in a tube and shook it to separate the cells. He reported that, contrary to Roux&#x27;s findings, he ended up with completely formed but smaller embryos. The reason for this discrepancy has been widely attributed to Driesch separating the two blastomeres completely rather than just killing one as Roux had done. Others, including Thomas Hunt Morgan and Oscar Hertwig, attempted to separate the two cells, for the matter was of great importance, particularly to the arguments between proponents of epigenesis and preformation, but satisfactory results could not be achieved.

As a master of micro-surgical technique, beginning with his continuing work on the amphibian eye, Spemann&#x27;s papers in the early years of the 20th century on this vexed question were to be a great contribution to the development of experimental morphogenesis, causing him to be hailed in some quarters as the true founder of micro-surgery. He succeeded in dividing the cells with a noose of baby hair. Spemann found that one half could indeed form a whole embryo, but observed that the plane of division was crucial. This dispatched the theory of preformation and gave some support to the concept of a morphogenetic field, a concept of which Spemann learned from Paul Alfred Weiss.

==Induction and organizers==

Spemann was appointed Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Rostock in 1908 and, in 1914, associate director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biology at Dahlem, Berlin. Here he undertook the experiments that would make him famous. Drawing upon the recent work of Warren H. Lewis and Ethel Browne Harvey, he turned his skills to the gastrula, grafting a &quot;field&quot; of cells (the Primitive knot) from one embryo onto another.

The experiments, performed by Hilde Proescholdt (later Mangold), a Ph.D. candidate in Spemann&#x27;s laboratory in Freiburg, took place over several years and were published in full only in 1924. They described an area in the embryo, the portions of which, upon transplantation into a second embryo, organized or &quot;induced&quot; secondary embryonic primordia regardless of location. Spemann called these areas &quot;organiser centres&quot; or &quot;organisers&quot;. Later he showed that different parts of the organiser centre produce different parts of the embryo.

Despite his modern reputation, Spemann continued to entertain neo-vitalist &quot;field&quot; analyses similar to those of Hans Driesch, Gurwitsch and Harold Saxton Burr. However, the follow-up work of Johannes Holtfreter, Dorothy M. Needham and Joseph Needham, Conrad Waddington and others showed that organizers killed by boiling, fixing or freezing were also capable of causing induction. The conclusion was that the actual controllers were inert molecules, though little headway was made until the end of the 20th century in discovering how signalling took place.

From 1919 Spemann was Professor of Zoology at the University of Freiburg-im-Breisgau, where he continued his line of enquiry until in 1937 he was relieved of his post to be replaced by one of his first students, Otto Mangold. He was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1925. In 1928 he was the first to perform somatic cell nuclear transfer using amphibian embryos – one of the first moves towards cloning. He was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1933. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1935. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1937. His theory of embryonic induction by organisers is described in his book &quot;Embryonic Development and Induction&quot; (1938). He died of heart failure on 12 September 1941. He never lost his love of classical literature and, throughout his life, organized evening gatherings of friends to discuss art, literature, and philosophy.
==Support of Nazism==
The commemoration of the 1923 death of Albert Leo Schlageter in Freiburg attracted particular attention. Hans Spemann suspended classes on June 6 and, with the deans in full regalia, went in a joint funeral procession with representatives of the student body and corporations to the train station, where they met with delegations of officers from Schlageter&#x27;s former regiment and the German Officers&#x27; Association and students from Schlageter&#x27;s former high school. Upon the train&#x27;s arrival, Spemann laid two wreaths, which were stowed in the semi-open baggage car decorated with flowers and emblazoned with swastikas. To the sounds of “I had a comrade”, the crowd swore Schlageter&#x27;s motto &quot;Heil, Sieg und Rache&quot;.

In 1935, at the end of Spemann&#x27;s acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, he gave a Nazi salute.
