<text>Bayard ( ; or just ; ) is a magical bay horse in the legends derived from the medieval . These texts, especially that of &quot;The Four Sons of Aymon&quot;, attribute to him magical qualities and a supernatural origin. He is known for his strength and intelligence, and possesses the supernatural ability to adjust his size to his riders.

Since the Middle Ages, Bayard has been an important figure in northern French and Belgian folklore, particularly in the Ardennes, notably in Bogny-sur-Meuse, Dinant, Namur and Dendermonde. Folk processions stage it among the processional giants, namely the Ducasse d&#x27;Ath and the Ommegang van Dendermonde. The widespread dissemination of his legend and its success have influenced many artists, as well as popular beliefs.

==Legend==
Bayard first appears as the property of Renaud de Montauban (Italian: &quot;Rinaldo&quot;) in the Old French twelfth century &quot;chanson de geste&quot; &quot;The Four Sons of Aymon&quot;. The horse was capable of carrying Rinaldo and his three brothers (&quot;the four sons of Aymon&quot;) all at the same time and of understanding human speech. Near the end of the work, Renaud is forced to cede Bayard to Charlemagne who, as punishment for the horse&#x27;s exploits, has a large stone tied to Bayard&#x27;s neck and has the horse pushed into the river; Bayard however smashes the stone with his hooves and escapes to live forever more in the woods.

In subsequent chansons de geste, Bayard was said to have been initially won by Renaud&#x27;s cousin, the magician Maugris, before being given to Renaud.
In Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology, Rinaldo&#x27;s acquisition of Bayard is described as follows: a disguised Maugris (who had previously acquired Bayard) tells Rinaldo that a wild horse under an enchantment roams the woods, and that this horse belonged initially to Amadis of Gaul and can only be won by a knight of Amadis&#x27; lineage. Rinaldo eventually subdues the horse by throwing it on the ground, breaking the enchantment. 

Bayard also appears in the epic poems on chivalrous subjects by Luigi Pulci, Matteo Maria Boiardo and Ludovico Ariosto.

Bayard, by the late 13th century, also acquired common usage as a name for any bay-coloured horse (reddish-brown coat with black mane and tail) and lost some of his lustre as a magic heroic horse. The name &quot;Bayard&quot; became associated in English literature with a clownish, blind and foolish horse. 

Chaucer first used &quot;Bayard&quot; in a simile in the epic poem &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;. As Troilus has been scorning the power of love before seeing Criseyde and falling in love himself, so Bayard, proudly skipping &quot;out of the wey&quot; while he pranced, had to admit &quot;Yet am I but an hors&quot;. Chaucer also used &quot;Bayard&quot; in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (c. 1387) to denote a randy stud in &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot; and a blind, foolish horse in &quot;The Canon&#x27;s Yeoman&#x27;s Tale&quot;: &quot;Though ye prolle ay, ye shul it nevere fynde. Ye been as boold as is Bayard the blynde. That blondreth forth and peril casteth noon.&quot; (&quot;Though you search afar, you shall never find it; Be you as bold as Bayard the blind, that blunders forth and perceives no peril.&quot;)

==Local==
Outside the Walloon town of Dinant in Belgium stands &quot;Bayard Rock&quot;, a large cleft rock formation that was said to have been split by Bayard&#x27;s mighty hooves. In Namur, the next town downriver along the Meuse, stands a locally famous statue of Bayard and the Four Aymon Brothers. There are plenty of named places in Wallonia linked to the legend of the Four Aymon Brothers and Bayard.
The Bayard legend is also celebrated in other towns in Belgium — most notably in the Flemish city of Dendermonde, where a large ommegang is organized every ten years. In several parts of Dendermonde, located outside of the city walls, namely &quot;Appels&quot;, &quot;Donckstraat&quot;, &quot;Keur&quot; and &quot;Sint-Gillis&quot;, smaller editions of this &quot;ommegang&quot; are organized on an annual basis.

The rivalry between Dendermonde and Aalst, a city close by, has led to the construction of the Steed Balatum by the inhabitants of Aalst, as a parody on Bayard.
Brussels (as part of the Ommegang), Lier, Mechelen and Ath all organize processions that include Bayard.

There are also Bayard statues in Ghent, Geldrop, Namur and Grembergen.

A similar magical horse named &quot;Blind Byard&quot; is part of Lincolnshire folklore at Byard&#x27;s Leap.

In the Catalan town of Riudoms the &quot;Cavall dels Nebot&quot; is carried through the streets every year.

<text>Purānas (Sanskrit: पुराण, lit. Ancients) are a vast genre of Indian literature that include a wide range of topics, especially legends and other traditional lore. The Puranas are known for the intricate layers of symbolism depicted within their stories. Composed originally in Sanskrit and in other Indian languages, several of these texts are named after major Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, and Tridevi. The Puranic genre of literature is found in both Hinduism and Jainism.

The Puranic literature is encyclopedic, and it includes diverse topics such as cosmogony, cosmology, genealogies of gods, goddesses, kings, queens, heroes, heroines, sages, other gods, other goddesses, folk tales, pilgrimages, temples, medicine, astronomy, grammar, mineralogy, humor, love stories, theology, philosophy, etc. The content is highly inconsistent across the Puranas, and each Purana has survived in numerous manuscripts which are themselves inconsistent. The Hindu Maha Puranas are traditionally attributed to Vyasa, but many scholars considered them likely the work of many authors over the centuries; in contrast, most Jaina Puranas can be dated and their authors assigned.

There are 18 &quot;Mukhya Puranas&quot; (Major Puranas) and 18 &quot;Upa Puranas&quot; (Minor Puranas), with over 400,000 verses. The first versions of various Puranas were likely to have been composed between 3rd and 10th century CE. While the Puranas do not enjoy the authority of a scripture in Hinduism and are considered Smritis, they shaped Hinduism more than the Vedas, providing a &quot;culture synthesis&quot; in weaving and integrating the diverse beliefs of a great number of local traditions into the Vedic-Brahmanic fold. While all Puranas praise many gods and goddesses and &quot;their sectarianism is far less clear cut&quot; than assumed, the religious practices included in them are considered &quot;Vaidika&quot; (congruent with Vedic literature). The Puranic literature wove with the Bhakti movement in India, and both Dvaita and Advaita scholars have commented on the underlying Vedantic themes in the &quot;Maha Puranas&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Douglas Harper states that the etymological origins of &quot;Puranas&quot; are from Sanskrit &quot;Puranah&quot;, literally &quot;ancient, former,&quot; from &quot;pura&quot; &quot;formerly, before,&quot; cognate with Greek &quot;paros&quot; &quot;before,&quot; &quot;pro&quot; &quot;before,&quot; Avestan &quot;paro&quot; &quot;before,&quot; Old English fore, from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*pre-&quot;, from &quot;*per-&quot;.&quot;

== Origin ==
Vyasa, the narrator of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, is hagiographically credited as the compiler of the Puranas. The ancient tradition suggests that originally there was but one Purana. Vishnu Purana (3.6.15) mentions that Vyasa entrusted his &quot;Puranasamhita&quot; to his disciple &quot;Lomaharshana&quot;, who in turn imparted it to his disciples, three of whom compiled their own samhitas. These three, together with Lomaharshana&#x27;s, comprise the &quot;Mulasamhita&quot;, from which the later eighteen Puranas were derived.

The term &quot;Purana&quot; appears in the Vedic texts. For example, Atharva Veda mentions &quot;Purana&quot; (in the singular) in XI.7.24 and XV.6.10-11:

Similarly, the Shatapatha Brahmana (XI.5.6.8) mentions &quot;Itihasapuranam&quot; (as one compound word) and recommends that on the 9th day of &quot;Pariplava,&quot; the &quot;hotr&quot; priest should narrate some Purana because &quot;the &quot;Purana&quot; is the Veda, this it is&quot; (XIII.4.3.13). However, states P.V. Kane, it is not certain whether these texts suggested several works or a single work with the term &quot;Purana&quot;. The late Vedic text &quot;Taittiriya Aranyaka&quot; (II.10) uses the term in the plural. Therefore, states Kane, that in the later Vedic period at least, the Puranas referred to three or more texts, and that they were studied and recited. In numerous passages the Mahabharata mentions &quot;&#x27;Purana&quot;&#x27; in both singular and plural forms. Moreover, it is not unlikely that, where the singular &#x27;&quot;Puranam&quot;&#x27; was employed in the texts, a class of works was meant. Further, despite the mention of the term Purana or Puranas in the Vedic texts, there is uncertainty about the contents of them until the composition of the oldest Dharmashastra &quot;Apastamba Dharmasutra&quot; and &quot;Gautama Dharmasutra&quot;, which mention Puranas that resemble the extant Puranas.

Another early mention of the term &#x27;Itihas-purana&#x27; is found in the Chandogya Upanishad (7.1.2), translated by Patrick Olivelle as &quot;the corpus of histories and ancient tales as the fifth Veda&quot;. The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad also refers to purana as the &quot;fifth Veda&quot;.

According to Thomas Coburn, Puranas and early extra-puranic texts attest to two traditions regarding their origin, one proclaiming a divine origin as the breath of the great beings, the other as a human sage named Vyasa as the arranger of already existing material into eighteen Puranas. In the early references, states Coburn, the term Purana occurs in singular unlike the later era which refers to a plural form presumably because they had assumed their &quot;multifarious form&quot;.

According to the Indologists J. A. B. van Buitenen and Cornelia Dimmitt, the Puranas that have survived into the modern era are ancient but represent &quot;an amalgam of two somewhat different but never entirely different separate oral literatures: the Brahmin tradition stemming from the reciters of the Vedas, and the bardic poetry recited by Sutas that was handed down in Kshatriya circles&quot;. The original Puranas comes from the priestly roots while the later genealogies have the warrior and epic roots. These texts were collected for the &quot;second time between the fourth and sixth centuries CE under the rule of the Gupta kings and queens&quot;, a period of Hindu renaissance. However, the editing and expansion of the Puranas did not stop after the Gupta era, and the texts continued to &quot;grow for another five hundred or a thousand years&quot; and these were preserved by priests who maintained Hindu pilgrimage sites and temples. The core of Itihasa-Puranas, states Klaus Klostermaier, may possibly go back to the 7th century BCE or even earlier.

==Dating==
It is not possible to set a specific date for any Purana as a whole, states Ludo Rocher. He points out that even for the better established and more coherent Puranas such as Bhagavata and Vishnu, the dates proposed by scholars continue to vary widely and endlessly. The date of the production of the written texts does not define the date of origin of the Puranas. They existed in an oral form before being written down. In the 19th century, F. E. Pargiter believed the &quot;original Purana&quot; may date to the time of the final redaction of the Vedas. Wendy Doniger, based on her study of indologists, assigns approximate dates to the various Puranas. She dates Markandeya Purana to (with one portion dated to c. 550 CE), Matsya Purana to c. 250–500 CE, Vayu Purana to c. 350 CE, Harivamsa and Vishnu Purana to c. 450 CE, Brahmanda Purana to c. 350–950 CE, Vamana Purana to c. 450–900 CE, Kurma Purana to c. 550–850 CE, and Linga Purana to c. 600–1000 CE.

== Texts ==

=== Mahapuranas ===
Of the many texts designated &#x27;Puranas&#x27; the most important are the &quot;s&quot; or the major Puranas. These are said to be eighteen in number, divided into three groups of six, though they are not always counted in the same way. The list of Mahapuranas is mentioned in the Vishnu Purana, part 3, chapter 6, verses 21–24. The number of verses in each Mahapurana is mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana, part 12, chapter 13, verses 4–9.

The Puranas, according to Flood, have traditionally been classified according to three qualities (&quot;guna&quot;) which are inherent in existence, namely the quality of light or purity (&quot;sattva&quot;), passion (&quot;rajas&quot;), and darkness or inertia (&quot;tamas&quot;), with each quality having six puranas focused, but not exclusively, upon a single deity.

The Puranas have also been classified based on a specific deity, although the texts are mixed and revere all gods and goddesses:
Two puranas have &quot;Bhagavata&quot; in their names, the Bhagavata Purana and Devi Bhagavata Purana, which Srivastava says both are called Mahapuranas in Sanskrit literature, where the Vayu Purana, Matsya Purana, and Aditya Upa Purana admit the Devi Bhagavata Purana as a Mahapurana, whereas the Padma Purana, Garuda Purana and Kurma Purana consider it an Upapurana. There are discussions on whether the Devi Bhagavata Purana is a Mahapurana.

=== Upapurana ===

The difference between Upapuranas and Mahapuranas has been explained by Rajendra Hazra: &quot;a Mahapurana is well known, and that what is less well known becomes an Upapurana&quot;. Rocher states that the distinction between Mahapurana and Upapurana is ahistorical, since there is little corroborating evidence that either were more or less known, and that &quot;the term Mahapurana occurs rarely in Purana literature, and is probably of late origin.&quot;

The &quot;Upapuranas&quot; are eighteen in number, with disagreement as to which canonical titles belong in that list of eighteen.

They include among –

# Sanat-kumara
# Narasimha
# Brihad-naradiya
# Shiva-rahasya
# Durvasa
# Kapila
# Vamana
# Bhargava
# Varuna
# Kalika
# Samba
# Nandi
# Surya
# Parasara
# Vasishtha
# Ganesha
# Mudgala
# Hamsa

Only a few have been critically edited.

The Ganesha and Mudgala Puranas are devoted to Ganesha.

=== Skanda Purana ===
The Skanda Purana is the largest Purana with 81,000 verses, named after the deity Skanda, the son of Shiva and Uma, and the brother of the deity Ganesha. The mythological part of the text weaves together the stories of Shiva and Vishnu, along with those featuring Parvati, Lakshmi, Rama, Krishna, Sita, Rukmini and other major gods and goddesses in the Hindu pantheon. In Chapter 1.8, it declares,

The Skanda Purana has received renewed scholarly interest ever since the late 20th century discovery of a Nepalese Skanda Purana manuscript dated to be from the early 9th century CE. This discovery established that the Skanda Purana existed by the 9th century CE. However, a comparison shows that the 9th century CE document is entirely different from versions of Skanda Purana that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era.

== Content ==

Several Puranas, such as the Matsya Purana, list &quot;five characteristics&quot; or &quot;five signs&quot; of a Purana. These are called the &quot;Pancha Lakshana&quot; ( ), and are topics covered by a Purana:
#&quot;Sarga&quot;: cosmogony or the creation of the world
#&quot;Pratisarga&quot;: cosmogony and cosmology
#&quot;Vamśa&quot;: genealogy of the gods, sages and kings and queens
#&quot;Manvañtara&quot;: cosmic cycles, the history of the world during the time of one patriarch and matriarch 
#&quot;Vamśānucaritam&quot;: Accounts of royal dynasties, including the Suryavamshi and Chandravamshi kings and queens 

A few Puranas, such as the most popular Bhagavata Purana, add five more characteristics to expand this list to ten:
#&quot;Utaya&quot;: karmic links between the deities, sages, kings and the various living beings
#&quot;Ishanukatha&quot;: tales about a god
#&quot;Nirodha&quot;: finale, cessation
#&quot;Mukti&quot;: moksha, spiritual liberation
#&quot;Ashraya&quot;: refuge

These five or ten sections weave in biographies, myths, geography, medicine, astronomy, Hindu temples, pilgrimage to distant real places, rites of passage, charity, ethics, duties, rights, dharma, divine intervention in cosmic and human affairs, love stories, festivals, theosophy and philosophy. The Puranas link gods to men, both generally and in a religious, bhakti (devotional) context. Here the Puranic literature follows a general pattern. It starts with an introduction, where a future devotee is described as ignorant about the deity, yet curious. The devotee learns about the deity, and this begins their spiritual realization. The text then describes instances of this deity&#x27;s grace, which inspires and deepens the devotee&#x27;s devotion towards the deity. The devotee, then, shows devotion, which is rewarded by the deity. The reward is appreciated by the devotee, who, in return, performs further actions to express further devotion.

The Puranas, states Flood, document the rise of the theistic traditions such as those based on Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Tridevi and include respective mythology, pilgrimage to holy places, rituals and genealogies. The bulk of these texts, in Flood&#x27;s view, were established by 500 CE, in the Gupta era, though amendments were made later. Along with inconsistencies, common ideas are found throughout the corpus, but it is not possible to trace the lines of influence of one Purana upon another, so the corpus is best viewed as a synchronous whole. An example of similar stories woven across the Puranas, but in different versions, include the &quot;Lingodbhava&quot; – the apparition of the &quot;Linga&quot;. The is a Shaiva story that features Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, the three major gods of Hinduism, who get together and debate about who is supreme amongst the three of them and after various incidents of the story, the glory of Shiva is established at the end by the apparition of the Linga which is a form of Shiva as Lingodbhava over Vishnu and Brahma, thus it shows that Vishnu and Brahma are secondary gods in the Trideva because he expanded and conquered the entire universe and them being secondary gods with lesser powers, so they cannot find his beginning and end at a single place in the universe. This story, state Bonnefoy and Doniger, appears in Vayu Purana&#x27;s chapter 1.55, Brahmanda Purana&#x27;s chapter 1.26, Shiva Purana&#x27;s Rudra Samhita&#x27;s Sristi Khanda&#x27;s chapter 15, Skanda Purana&#x27;s chapters 1.3, 1.16, 3.1, and other Puranas.

The texts are in Sanskrit as well as regional languages, and almost entirely in narrative metric couplets.

=== Symbolism and layers of meaning ===
The texts use ideas, concepts and even names that are symbolic. The words can interpreted literally, and at an axiological level. The Vishnu Purana, for example, recites a myth where the names of the characters are loaded with symbolism and axiological significance. The myth is as follows,

=== Puranas as a complement to the Vedas ===
The relation of the Puranas with Vedas has been debated by scholars, some holding that there&#x27;s no relationship, others contending that they are identical. The Puranic literature, stated Max Muller, is independent, has changed often over its history, and has little relation to the Vedic age or the Vedic literature. In contrast, Purana literature is evidently intended to serve as a complement to the Vedas, states Vans Kennedy.

Some scholars such as Govinda Das suggest that the Puranas claim a link to the Vedas but in name only, not in substance. The link is purely a mechanical one. Scholars such as Viman Chandra Bhattacharya and PV Kane state that the Puranas are a continuation and development of the Vedas. Sudhakar Malaviya and VG Rahurkar state the connection is closer in that the Puranas are companion texts to help understand and interpret the Vedas. K.S. Ramaswami Sastri and Manilal N. Dvivedi reflect the third view which states that Puranas enable us to know the &quot;true import of the ethos, philosophy, and religion of the Vedas&quot;.

Barbara Holdrege questions the fifth Veda status of &quot;Itihasas&quot; (the Hindu epics) and Puranas. The Puranas, states V.S. Agrawala, intend to &quot;explicate, interpret, adapt&quot; the metaphysical truths in the Vedas. In the general opinion, states Rocher, &quot;the Puranas cannot be divorced from the Vedas&quot; though scholars provide different interpretations of the link between the two. Scholars have given the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; as an example of the links and continuity of the Vedic content, such as its providing an interpretation of the Gayatri mantra.

=== Puranas as encyclopedias ===
The Puranas, states Kees Bolle, are best seen as &quot;vast, often encyclopedic&quot; works from ancient and medieval India. Some of them, such as the Agni Purana and Matsya Purana, cover all sorts of subjects, dealing with – states Rocher – &quot;anything and everything&quot;, from fiction to facts, from practical recipes to abstract philosophy, from geographic &quot;Mahatmyas&quot; (travel guides) to cosmetics, from festivals to astronomy. Like encyclopedias, they were updated to remain current with their times, by a process called &quot;Upabrimhana&quot;. However, some of the 36 major and minor Puranas are more focused handbooks, such as the Skanda Purana, Padma Purana and Bhavishya Purana, which deal primarily with &quot;Tirtha Mahatmyas&quot; (pilgrimage travel guides) while Vayu Purana and Brahmanda Purana focus more on history, mythology and legends.

=== Puranas as religious texts ===
The colonial-era scholars of Puranas studied them primarily as religious texts, with Vans Kennedy declaring in 1837 that any other use of these documents would be disappointing. John Zephaniah Holwell, who from 1732 onwards spent 30 years in India and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767, described the Puranas as &quot;18 books of divine words&quot;. British officials and researchers such as Holwell, states Urs App, were orientalist scholars who introduced a distorted picture of Indian literature and Puranas as &quot;sacred scriptures of India&quot; in 1767. Holwell, states Urs App, &quot;presented it as the opinion of knowledgeable Indians; But it is abundantly clear that no knowledgeable Indian would ever have said anything remotely similar&quot;.

Modern scholarship doubts this 19th-century premise. Ludo Rocher, for example, states,

The study of Puranas as religious texts remains a controversial subject. Some Indologists, in the colonial tradition of scholarship, treat the Puranic texts as scriptures, or as useful sources of religious contents. Other scholars, such as Ronald Inden, consider this approach &quot;essentialist and antihistorical&quot; because the Purana texts changed often over time and over distance, and the underlying presumption of them being religious texts is that those changes are &quot;Hinduism expressed by a religious leader or philosopher&quot;, or the &quot;expressiveness of Hindu mind&quot;, or &quot;society at large&quot;, when the texts and passages are literary works and &quot;individual geniuses of their authors&quot;.

==== Jainism ====

The Jaina Puranas are like Hindu Puranas encyclopedic epics in style, and are considered as &quot;anuyogas&quot; (expositions), but they are not considered Jain Agamas and do not have scripture or quasi-canonical status in Jainism tradition. They are best described, states John Cort, as post-scripture literary corpus based upon themes found in Jain scriptures.

==== Sectarian, pluralistic or monotheistic theme ====
Scholars have debated whether the Puranas should be categorized as sectarian, or non-partisan, or monotheistic religious texts. Different Puranas describe a number of stories where Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva compete for supremacy. In some Puranas, such as Devi Bhagavata Purana, the Goddess Devi joins the competition and ascends for the position of being Supreme. Further, most Puranas emphasize legends around one who is either Shiva, or Vishnu, or Devi. The texts thus appear to be sectarian. However, states Edwin Bryant, while these legends sometimes appear to be partisan, they are merely acknowledging the obvious question of whether one or the other is more important, more powerful. In the final analysis, all Puranas weave their legends to celebrate pluralism, and accept the other two and all gods in Hindu pantheon as personalized form but equivalent essence of the Ultimate Reality called Brahman. The Puranas are not spiritually partisan, states Bryant, but &quot;accept and indeed extol the transcendent and absolute nature of the other, and of the Goddess Devi too&quot;.

Ludo Rocher, in his review of Puranas as sectarian texts, states, &quot;even though the Puranas contain sectarian materials, their sectarianism should not be interpreted as exclusivism in favor of one god to the detriment of all others&quot;.

=== Puranas as historical texts ===
Despite the diversity and wealth of manuscripts from ancient and medieval India that have survived into the modern times, there is a paucity of historical data in them. Neither the author name nor the year of their composition were recorded or preserved, over the centuries, as the documents were copied from one generation to another. This paucity tempted 19th-century scholars to use the Puranas as a source of chronological and historical information about India or Hinduism. This effort was, after some effort, either summarily rejected by some scholars, or become controversial, because the Puranas include fables and fiction, and the information within and across the Puranas was found to be inconsistent.

In early 20th-century, some regional records were found to be more consistent, such as for the Hindu dynasties in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh. Basham, as well as Kosambi, have questioned whether lack of inconsistency is sufficient proof of reliability and historicity. More recent scholarship has attempted to, with limited success, states Ludo Rocher, use the Puranas for historical information in combination with independent corroborating evidence, such as &quot;epigraphy, archaeology, Buddhist literature, Jaina literature, non-Puranic literature, Islamic records, and records preserved outside India by travelers to or from India in medieval times such as in China, Myanmar and Indonesia&quot;.

== Manuscripts ==

The study of Puranas manuscripts has been challenging because they are highly inconsistent. This is true for all Mahapuranas and Upapuranas. Most editions of Puranas, in use particularly by Western scholars, are &quot;based on one manuscript or on a few manuscripts selected at random&quot;, even though divergent manuscripts with the same title exist. Scholars have long acknowledged the existence of Purana manuscripts that &quot;seem to differ much from the printed edition&quot;, and it is unclear which one is accurate, and whether conclusions drawn from the randomly or cherrypicked printed version were universal over geography or time. This problem is most severe with Purana manuscripts of the same title, but in regional languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, and others which have largely been ignored.

=== Chronology ===
Newly discovered Puranas manuscripts from the medieval centuries have attracted scholarly attention and the conclusion that the Puranic literature has gone through slow redaction and text corruption over time, as well as sudden deletion of numerous chapters and its replacement with new content to an extent that the currently circulating Puranas are entirely different from those that existed before 11th century, or 16th century.

For example, a newly discovered palm-leaf manuscript of Skanda Purana in Nepal has been dated to be from 810 CE but is entirely different from versions of Skanda Purana that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era. Further discoveries of four more manuscripts, each different, suggest that document has gone through major redactions twice, first likely before the 12th century, and the second very large change sometime in the 15th-16th century for unknown reasons. The different versions of manuscripts of Skanda Purana suggest that &quot;minor&quot; redactions, interpolations, and corruption of the ideas in the text over time.

Rocher states that the date of the composition of each Purana remains a contested issue. Dimmitt and van Buitenen state that each of the Puranas manuscripts is encyclopedic in style, and it is difficult to ascertain when, where, why and by whom these were written:

=== Forgeries ===
Many of the extant manuscripts were written on palm leaf or copied during the British India colonial era, some in the 19th century. The scholarship on various Puranas, has suffered from frequent forgeries, states Ludo Rocher, where liberties in the transmission of Puranas were normal and those who copied older manuscripts replaced words or added new content to fit the theory that the colonial scholars were keen on publishing.

=== Translations ===
Horace Hayman Wilson published one of the earliest English translations of one version of the Vishnu Purana in 1840. The same manuscript, and Wilson&#x27;s translation, was reinterpreted by Manmatha Nath Dutt and published in 1896. The All India Kashiraj Trust has published editions of the Puranas.

Marinas Poullé (Mariyadas Pillai) published a French translation from a Tamil version of the Bhagavata Purana in 1788, and this was widely distributed in Europe becoming an introduction to the 18th-century Hindu culture and Hinduism to many Europeans during the colonial era. Poullé republished a different translation of the same text as &quot;Le Bhagavata&quot; in 1795, from Pondicherry. A copy of Poullé translation is preserved in Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris.

== Influence ==

The most significant influence of the Puranas genre of Indian literature has been, stated scholars and particularly Indian scholars, in &quot;culture synthesis&quot;, in weaving and integrating the diverse beliefs from ritualistic rites of passage to Vedantic philosophy, from fictional legends to factual history, from individual introspective yoga to social celebratory festivals, from temples to pilgrimage, from one god to another, from goddesses to tantra, from the old to the new. These have been dynamic open texts, composed socially, over time. This, states Greg Bailey, may have allowed the Hindu culture to &quot;preserve the old while constantly coming to terms with the new&quot;, and &quot;if they are anything, they are records of cultural adaptation and transformation&quot; over the last 2,000 years.

The Puranic literature, suggests Khanna, influenced &quot;acculturation and accommodation&quot; of a diversity of people, with different languages and from different economic classes, across different kingdoms and traditions, catalyzing the syncretic &quot;cultural mosaic of Hinduism&quot;. They helped influence cultural pluralism in India and are a literary record thereof.

Om Prakash states the Puranas served as an efficient medium for cultural exchange and popular education in ancient and medieval India. These texts adopted, explained, and integrated regional deities such as Pashupata in Vayu Purana, Sattva in Vishnu Purana, Dattatreya in Markendeya Purana, Bhojakas in Bhavishya Purana. Further, states Prakash, they dedicated chapters to &quot;secular subjects such as poetics, dramaturgy, grammar, lexicography, astronomy, war, politics, architecture, geography and medicine as in Agni Purana, perfumery and lapidary arts in Garuda Purana, painting, sculpture and other arts in Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot;.

; Indian Arts
The cultural influence of the Puranas extended to Indian classical arts, such as songs, dance culture such as Bharata Natyam in south India and Rasa Lila in northeast India, plays and recitations.

; Festivals
The myths, lunar calendar schedule, rituals, and celebrations of major Hindu cultural festivities such as Holi, Diwali and Durga Puja are in the Puranic literature.

<text>Susan Haack (; born 1945) is a distinguished professor in the humanities, Cooper Senior Scholar in Arts and Sciences, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.

Haack has written on logic, the philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics. Her pragmatism follows that of Charles Sanders Peirce.

==Career==
===Education===
Haack is a graduate of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge (B.A., B.Phil., Oxford; Ph.D., Cambridge). She was elected into Phi Beta Kappa as an honorary member. At Oxford, she studied at St. Hilda&#x27;s College, where her first philosophy teacher was Jean Austin, the widow of J. L. Austin. As an undergraduate, she took Politics, Philosophy and Economics and said of her taste for philosophy: &quot;it was, initially, the &#x27;politics&#x27; part that most appealed to me. But somewhere down the line, despite encouragement from my politics tutor to pursue that subject, philosophy took over.&quot;

She studied Plato with Gilbert Ryle and logic with Michael Dummett. David Pears supervised her B.Phil. dissertation on ambiguity. At Cambridge, she wrote her PhD under the supervision of Timothy Smiley. She held the positions of Fellow of New Hall, Cambridge and professor of philosophy at the University of Warwick before taking her current position at the University of Miami.

Haack has said of her career that she is &quot;very independent&quot;:
==Philosophical work==
Haack&#x27;s major contribution to philosophy, in the 1993 book &quot;Evidence and Inquiry&quot; is her epistemological theory called foundherentism, which is her attempt to avoid the logical problems of both pure foundationalism (which is susceptible to infinite regress) and pure coherentism (which is susceptible to circularity). She illustrates this idea with the metaphor of the crossword puzzle. A highly simplified version of this proceeds as follows: Finding an answer using a clue is analogous to a foundational source (grounded in empirical evidence). Making sure that the interlocking words are mutually sensible is analogous to justification through coherence. Both are necessary components in the justification of knowledge.

Haack has been a fierce critic of Richard Rorty. She wrote a play, &quot;We Pragmatists ...: Peirce and Rorty in Conversation&quot;, consisting entirely of quotes from both philosophers. She performed the role of Peirce. Haack published a vigorous essay in the &quot;New Criterion&quot;, taking strong exception to many of Rorty&#x27;s views, especially his claim to be a sort of pragmatist.

In &quot;Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate&quot;, Haack is highly critical of the view that there is a specifically female perspective on logic and scientific truth and is critical of feminist epistemology. She holds that many feminist critiques of science and philosophy are excessively concerned with political correctness.

Haack describes her 2003 book &quot;Defending Science – Within Reason: Between Scientism and Cynicism&quot;, as a defence of scientific inquiry from the moderate viewpoint. During an interview with D.J. Grothe, then of the Center for Inquiry, Haack put forward the proposition that those on the far left consider science to be rhetoric motivated by power or politics, and she then proceeds to show how science can, and often does provide real benefits and gains, regardless of what the left may claim. The book offers a sounder and more solid defence of scientific inquiry in response to the narrow logical models of rationality proposed by some philosophers of science. Haack&#x27;s opinion on the topic of inquiry, whoever may be undertaking it, is that good evidence, sound methods, transparent review and fitting new discovery into the collective sphere of human knowledge are signs of robust inquiry. Haack claims that quality inquiry can be done by many, however the scientific community has numerous tools or helps that have brought many benefits to mankind, and which help foster science&#x27;s credibility. These tools and helps may not be available to those engaged in individual inquiry. When asked about how she responds to paranormal or supernatural claims, Haack indicates supporters of such claims have a heavy burden of proof. Rather than labelling such claims as pseudo-science, she admits these things can be &quot;pretty bad stuff&quot; and if they are to be considered seriously, they would need extraordinary evidence, and that such evidence should fit with the best warranted scientific theory about how things are. In this interview Haack also responds to the question of religion&#x27;s compatibility with science. She agrees there is great tension between the two. While stating her disagreement with British philosopher of religion Richard G. Swinburne and Stephen Jay Gould, she referred to the pertinent chapter of her book for a comprehensive understanding of her views on this matter.

In the related chapter ten of &quot;Defending Science&quot;, Haack disagrees with Gould&#x27;s claim that science and religion have their own distinct domains that do not overlap. (See NOMA). Haack also disagrees with Swinburne. Haack believes that while scientists, historians and detectives play a useful role in scientific inquiry, theologians do not. Haack shows how religion and science make claims about how the world is. She shows how science and religion also make assertions as to what could lead to a better human condition. By these statements, Haack shows that religion and science do not enjoy their own separate space. She points out areas where prior and current religious claims about the natural universe are strongly refuted by the best warranted findings of science. She also stipulates that controversy and unanswered questions abound in modern science. She summarises her defence for scientific inquiry by stating that she makes no apology for reserving her &quot;greatest admiration for those who delight to exercise the mind, no matter which way it takes them...those for whom doing their damnedest with the mind, no holds barred, is a point of honor&quot;.

She has written for &quot;Free Inquiry&quot; magazine and the Council for Secular Humanism. Haack&#x27;s work has been reviewed and cited in the popular press, such as &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; as well as in academic journals.

<text>Vouprasia () is a former municipality in Elis, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Andravida-Kyllini, of which it is a municipal unit. Its seat of administration was Varda. The municipal unit has about 10,600 inhabitants. The area of the municipal unit is 170.859 km2.

==Geography==

Vouprasia is located in northern Elis, on the Ionian coast between Patras and Pyrgos. The Greek National Road 9/E55 and the Patras-Kalamata railway line pass through it. Vouprasia has one disused railway station, in Varda.

The area is mostly flat, and the main land use is agriculture. The lagoon Kotychi, connected with the Ionian Sea, is located in the western part of Vouprasia. There is a health center in Varda.

Vouprasia borders on (clockwise from the west) the Ionian Sea, the municipal units Larissos and Olenia (both Achaea) and the municipal units Pineia, Amaliada and Lechaina (both Elis).

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Vouprasia is subdivided into the following communities:

<doc id="321986" wikidata="Q134688" url="?curid=321986" title="Diapsid">
<text>Diapsids (&quot;two arches&quot;) are a clade of sauropsids, distinguished from more primitive eureptiles by the presence of two holes, known as temporal fenestrae, in each side of their skulls. The earliest traditionally identified diapsids, the araeoscelidians, appeared about three hundred million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. All diapsids other than the most primitive ones in the clade Araeoscelidia are often placed into the clade Neodiapsida. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include birds and all modern reptile groups, including turtles, which were historically thought to lie outside the group. All modern reptiles and birds are placed within the neodiapsid subclade Sauria. Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 17,084 species of diapsid animals are extant: 9,159 birds, and 7,925 snakes, lizards, tuatara, turtles, and crocodiles.

==Characteristics==
The name Diapsida means &quot;two arches&quot;, and diapsids are traditionally classified based on their two ancestral skull openings (temporal fenestrae) posteriorly above and below the eye. This arrangement allows for the attachment of larger, stronger jaw muscles, and enables the jaw to open more widely. A more obscure ancestral characteristic is a relatively long lower arm bone (the radius) compared to the upper arm bone (humerus).

Basal non-saurian neodiaspids were ancestrally lizard-like, but basal non-saurian neodiapsids include aquatic/amphibious taxa (&quot;Claudiosaurus&quot; and some tangasaurids) the gliding lizard-like Weigeltisauridae, as well as the Triassic chameleon-like drepanosaurs.

==Classification==
Diapsids were originally classified as one of four subclasses of the class Reptilia, all of which were based on the number and arrangement of openings in the skull. The other three subclasses were Synapsida (one opening low on the skull, for the &quot;mammal-like reptiles&quot;), Anapsida (no skull opening, including turtles and their relatives), and Euryapsida (one opening high on the skull, including many prehistoric marine reptiles). With the advent of phylogenetic nomenclature, this system of classification was heavily modified. Today, the synapsids are often not considered true reptiles, while Euryapsida were found to be an unnatural assemblage of diapsids that had lost one of their skull openings. Genetic studies and the discovery of the Triassic &quot;Pappochelys&quot; have shown that this is also the case in turtles, which are actually heavily modified diapsids. In phylogenetic systems, birds (descendants of traditional diapsid reptiles) are also considered to be members of this group.

Some modern studies of reptile relationships have preferred to use the name &quot;diapsid&quot; to refer to the crown group of all modern diapsid reptiles but not their extinct relatives. However, many researchers have also favored a more traditional definition that includes the prehistoric araeoscelidians. In 1991, Laurin defined Diapsida as a clade, &quot;the most recent common ancestor of araeoscelidians, lepidosaurs, and archosaurs, and all its descendants&quot;.

The clade Neodiapsida was given a phylogenetic definition by Laurin in 1991. He defined it as the branch-based clade containing all animals more closely related to &quot;Younginiformes&quot; (later, more specifically, emended to &quot;Youngina capensis&quot;) than to &quot;Petrolacosaurus&quot; (representing Araeoscelidia). The earliest known neodiapsids like &quot;Orovenator&quot; are known from the Early Permian, around 290 million years ago.

All genetic studies have supported the hypothesis that turtles are diapsid reptiles; some have placed turtles within archosauromorpha, or, more commonly, as a sister group to extant archosaurs.

Modern reptiles and birds are placed within the neodiapsid subclade Sauria, defined as the last common ancestor of Lepidosauria (which includes lizards, snakes and the tuatara), and Archosauria (which includes crocodilians and dinosaurs, including birds, among others).

A cladistic analysis by Laurin and Piñeiro (2017) recovers Parareptilia as part of Diapsida, with pareiasaurs, turtles, millerettids, and procolophonoids recovered as more derived than the basal diapsid &quot;Younginia&quot;. A 2020 study by David P. Ford and Roger B. J. Benson also recovered Parareptilia as deeply nested within Diapsida as the sister group to Neodiapsida. They united this relationship between Parareptilia and Neodiapsida in the new clade Neoreptilia, defining it as the last common ancestor and all descendants of &quot;Procolophon trigoniceps&quot; and &quot;Youngina capensis&quot;. However, this excludes mesosaurs, who were found to be basal among the sauropsids. Other recent studies have found the more traditional arrangement of parareptiles being outside of Diapsida.

The position of the highly derived Mesozoic marine reptile groups Thalattosauria, Ichthyosauromorpha and Sauropterygia within Neodiapsida is uncertain, and they may lie within Sauria.

<text>The Anunnaki (Sumerian: , also transcribed as Anunaki, Annunaki, Anunna, Ananaki and other variations) are a group of deities of the ancient Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians and Babylonians. In the earliest Sumerian writings about them, which come from the Post-Akkadian period, the Anunnaki are deities in the pantheon, descendants of An (the god of the heavens) and Ki (the goddess of earth), and their primary function was to decree the fates of humanity.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Anunnaki&quot; is derived from An, the Sumerian god of the sky. The name is variously written &quot;&quot;d&quot;a-nuna&quot;, &quot;&quot;d&quot;a-nuna-ke4-ne&quot;, or &quot;&quot;d&quot;a-nun-na&quot;, meaning &quot;princely offspring&quot; or &quot;offspring of An&quot;.

The Anunnaki were believed to be the offspring of An and the earth goddess Ki. Samuel Noah Kramer identifies Ki with the Sumerian mother goddess Ninhursag, stating that they were originally the same figure. The oldest of the Anunnaki was Enlil, the god of air and chief god of the Sumerian pantheon. The Sumerians believed that, until Enlil was born, heaven and earth were inseparable. Then, Enlil split heaven and earth in two and carried away the earth while his father An carried away the sky.

==Worship and iconography==
The Anunnaki are chiefly mentioned in literary texts and very little evidence to support the existence of any cult of them has yet been unearthed. This is likely because each member of the Anunnaki had his or her own individual cult, separate from the others. Similarly, no representations of the Anunnaki as a complete group have yet been discovered, although a few depictions of two or three individual members together have been identified. Deities in ancient Mesopotamia were almost exclusively anthropomorphic. They were thought to possess extraordinary powers and were often envisioned as being of tremendous physical size. The deities typically wore &quot;melam&quot;, an ambiguous substance which &quot;covered them in terrifying splendor&quot;. &quot;Melam&quot; could also be worn by heroes, kings, giants, and even demons. The effect that seeing a deity&#x27;s &quot;melam&quot; has on a human is described as &quot;ni&quot;, a word for the physical tingling of the flesh. Deities were almost always depicted wearing horned caps, consisting of up to seven superimposed pairs of ox-horns. They were also sometimes depicted wearing clothes with elaborate decorative gold and silver ornaments sewn into them.

The ancient Mesopotamians believed that their deities lived in Heaven, after an earlier history of visiting earth in the mythological texts, and that a god&#x27;s statue was a physical embodiment of the god himself. As such, cult statues were given constant care and attention and a set of priests was assigned to tend to them. These priests would clothe the statues and place feasts before them so they could &quot;eat&quot;. A deity&#x27;s temple was believed to be that deity&#x27;s literal place of residence. The gods had boats, full-sized barges which were normally stored inside their temples and were used to transport their cult statues along waterways during various religious festivals. The gods also had chariots, which were used for transporting their cult statues by land. Sometimes a deity&#x27;s cult statue would be transported to the location of a battle so that the deity could watch the battle unfold. The major deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon, which included the Anunnaki, were believed to participate in the &quot;assembly of the gods&quot;, through which the gods made all of their decisions. This assembly was seen as a divine counterpart to the semi-democratic legislative system that existed during the Third Dynasty of Ur ( 2112 BC – 2004 BC).

==Mythology==
===Sumerian===

The earliest known usages of the term &quot;Anunnaki&quot; come from inscriptions written during the reign of Gudea ( 2144–2124 BC) and the Third Dynasty of Ur. In the earliest texts, the term is applied to the most powerful and important deities in the Sumerian pantheon: the descendants of the sky-god An.This group of deities probably included the &quot;seven gods who decree&quot;: An, Enlil, Enki, Ninhursag, Nanna, Utu, and Inanna.

Although certain deities are described as members of the Anunnaki, no complete list of the names of all the Anunnaki has survived and they are usually only referred to as a cohesive group in literary texts. Furthermore, Sumerian texts describe the Anunnaki inconsistently and do not agree on how many Anunnaki there were, or what their divine function was. Originally, the Anunnaki appear to have been heavenly deities with immense powers. In the poem &quot;Enki and the World Order&quot;, the Anunnaki &quot;do homage&quot; to Enki, sing hymns of praise in his honor, and &quot;take up their dwellings&quot; among the people of Sumer. The same composition twice states that the Anunnaki &quot;decree the fates of mankind&quot;.

Virtually every major deity in the Sumerian pantheon was regarded as the patron of a specific city and was expected to protect that city&#x27;s interests. The deity was believed to permanently reside within that city&#x27;s temple. One text mentions as many as fifty Anunnaki associated with the city of Eridu. In &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent into the Netherworld&quot;, there are only seven Anunnaki, who reside within the Underworld and serve as judges. Inanna stands trial before them for her attempt to take over the Underworld; they deem her guilty of hubris and condemn her to death.

Major deities in Sumerian mythology were associated with specific celestial bodies. Inanna was believed to be the planet Venus. Utu was believed to be the sun. Nanna was the moon. An was identified with all the stars of the equatorial sky, Enlil with those of the northern sky, and Enki with those of the southern sky. The path of Enlil&#x27;s celestial orbit was a continuous, symmetrical circle around the north celestial pole, but those of An and Enki were believed to intersect at various points.

===Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian===

Akkadian texts of the second millennium BC follow similar portrayals of the Anunnaki from &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent into the Netherworld&quot;, depicting them as chthonic Underworld deities. In an abbreviated Akkadian version of &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot; written in the early second millennium, Ereshkigal, the queen of the Underworld, comments that she &quot;drink[s] water with the Anunnaki&quot;. Later in the same poem, Ereshkigal orders her servant Namtar to fetch the Anunnaki from Egalgina, to &quot;decorate the threshold steps with coral&quot;, and to &quot;seat them on golden thrones&quot;.

During the Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 BC – c. 1531 BC), a new set of deities known as the Igigi are introduced. The relationship between the Anunnaki and the Igigi is unclear. On some occasions, the categories appear to be used synonymously, but in other writings, such as &quot;The Poem of Erra&quot;, there is a clear distinction between the two. In the late Akkadian &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot; epic, the Igigi are the sixth generation of the gods who are forced to perform labor for the Anunnaki. After forty days, the Igigi rebel and the god Enki, one of the Anunnaki, creates humans to replace them.

From the Middle Babylonian Period ( 1592 – 1155 BC) onward, the name &quot;Anunnaki&quot; was applied generally to the deities of the underworld; whereas the name &quot;Igigi&quot; was applied to the heavenly deities. During this period, the underworld deities Damkina, Nergal, and Madānu are listed as the most powerful among the Anunnaki, alongside Marduk, the national god of ancient Babylon.

In the standard Akkadian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; ( 1200 BC) Utnapishtim, the immortal survivor of the Great Flood, describes the Anunnaki as seven judges of the Underworld, who set the land aflame as the storm approaches. Later, when the flood comes, Ishtar (the East Semitic equivalent to Inanna) and the Anunnaki mourn over the destruction of humanity.

In the Babylonian &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot;, Marduk assigns the Anunnaki their positions. A late Babylonian version of the epic mentions 600 Anunnaki of the underworld, but only 300 Anunnaki of heaven, indicating the existence of a complex underworld cosmology. In gratitude, the Anunnaki, the &quot;Great Gods&quot;, build Esagila, a &quot;splendid&quot; temple dedicated to Marduk, Ea, and Ellil. In the eighth-century BC &quot;Poem of Erra&quot;, the Anunnaki are described as the brothers of the god Nergal and are depicted as antagonistic towards humanity.

A badly damaged text from the Neo-Assyrian Period (911 – 612 BC) describes Marduk leading his army of Anunnaki into the sacred city of Nippur and causing a disturbance. The disturbance causes a flood, which forces the resident gods of Nippur to take shelter in the Eshumesha temple to Ninurta. Enlil is enraged at Marduk&#x27;s transgression and orders the gods of Eshumesha to take Marduk and the other Anunnaki as prisoners. The Anunnaki are captured, but Marduk appoints his front-runner Mushteshirhablim to lead a revolt against the gods of Eshumesha and sends his messenger Neretagmil to alert Nabu, the god of literacy. When the Eshumesha gods hear Nabu speak, they come out of their temple to search for him. Marduk defeats the Eshumesha gods and takes 360 of them as prisoners of war, including Enlil himself. Enlil protests that the Eshumesha gods are innocent, so Marduk puts them on trial before the Anunnaki. The text ends with a warning from Damkianna (another name for Ninhursag) to the gods and to humanity, pleading them not to repeat the war between the Anunnaki and the gods of Eshumesha.

===Hurrian and Hittite===
In the mythologies of the Hurrians and Hittites (which flourished in the mid to late second millennium BC), the oldest generation of gods was believed to have been banished by the younger gods to the Underworld, where they were ruled by the goddess Lelwani. Hittite scribes identified these deities with the Anunnaki. In ancient Hurrian, the Anunnaki are referred to as &quot;karuileš šiuneš&quot;, which means &quot;former ancient gods&quot;, or &quot;kattereš šiuneš&quot;, which means &quot;gods of the earth&quot;. Hittite and Hurrian treaties were often sworn by the old gods in order to ensure that the oaths would be kept. In one myth, the gods are threatened by the stone giant Ullikummi, so Ea (the later name for Enki) commands the Former Gods to find the weapon that was used to separate the heavens from the earth. They find it and use it to cut off Ullikummi&#x27;s feet.

Although the names of the Anunnaki in Hurrian and Hittite texts frequently vary, they are always eight in number. In one Hittite ritual, the names of the old gods are listed as: &quot;Aduntarri the diviner, Zulki the dream interpretess, Irpitia Lord of the Earth, Narā, Namšarā, Minki, Amunki, and Āpi.&quot; The old gods had no identifiable cult in the Hurrio-Hittite religion; instead, the Hurrians and Hittites sought to communicate with the old gods through the ritual sacrifice of a piglet in a pit dug in the ground. The old gods were often invoked to perform ritual purifications.

The Hittite account of the old gods&#x27; banishment to the Underworld is closely related with the Greek poet Hesiod&#x27;s narrative of the overthrow of the Titans by the Olympians in his &quot;Theogony&quot;. The Greek sky-god Ouranos (whose name means &quot;Heaven&quot;) is the father of the Titans and is derived from the Hittite version of Anu. In Hesiod&#x27;s account, Ouranos is castrated by his son Cronus, just as Anu was castrated by his son Kumarbi in the Hittite story.

==Pseudoarchaeology and conspiracy theories==


Over a series of published books (starting with &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; in 1968), pseudoarchaeologist Erich von Däniken claimed that extraterrestrial &quot;ancient astronauts&quot; had visited a prehistoric Earth. Däniken explains the origins of religions as reactions to contact with an alien race, and offers interpretations of Sumerian texts and the Old Testament as evidence.

In his 1976 book &quot;The Twelfth Planet&quot;, author Zecharia Sitchin claimed that the Anunnaki were actually an advanced humanoid extraterrestrial species from the undiscovered planet Nibiru, who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago and constructed a base of operations in order to mine gold after discovering that the planet was rich in the precious metal. According to Sitchin, the Anunnaki hybridized their species and &quot;Homo erectus&quot; via in vitro fertilization in order to create humans as a slave species of miners. Sitchin claimed that the Anunnaki were forced to temporarily leave Earth&#x27;s surface and orbit the planet when Antarctic glaciers melted, causing the Great Flood, which also destroyed the Anunnaki&#x27;s bases on Earth. These had to be rebuilt, and the Anunnaki, needing more humans to help in this massive effort, taught mankind agriculture.

Ronald H. Fritze writes that, according to Sitchin, &quot;the Annunaki built the pyramids and all the other monumental structures from around the ancient world that ancient astronaut theorists consider so impossible to build without highly advanced technologies.&quot; Sitchin expanded on this mythology in later works, including &quot;The Stairway to Heaven&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Wars of Gods and Men&quot; (1985). In &quot;The End of Days: Armageddon and the Prophecy of the Return&quot; (2007), Sitchin predicted that the Anunnaki would return to earth, possibly as soon as 2012, corresponding to the end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Sitchin&#x27;s writings have been universally rejected by mainstream historians, who have labelled his books as pseudoarchaeology, asserting that Sitchin seems to deliberately misrepresent Sumerian texts by quoting them out of context, truncating quotations, and mistranslating Sumerian words to give them radically different meanings from their accepted definitions.

David Icke, the British conspiracy theorist who popularised the reptilian conspiracy theory, has claimed that the reptilian overlords of his theory are in fact the Anunnaki. Clearly influenced by Sitchin&#x27;s writings, Icke adapts them &quot;in favor of his own New Age and conspiratorial agenda&quot;. Icke&#x27;s speculation on the Anunnaki incorporates far-right views on history, positing an Aryan master race descended by blood from the Anunnaki. It also incorporates dragons, Dracula, and draconian laws, these three elements apparently linked only by superficial linguistic similarity. He formulated his views on the Anunnaki in the 1990s and has written several books about his theory.

<text>Tantras in Hinduism are esoteric scriptures.

==Classes==
The word &quot;tantra&quot; is made up by the joining (&quot;sandhi&quot; in Sanskrit) of two Sanskrit words: &quot;tanoti&quot; (expansion) and &quot;trayati&quot; (liberation). Tantra means liberation of energy and expansion of consciousness from its gross form. It is a method to expand the mind and liberate the dormant potential energy, and its principles form the basis of all yogic practices. Hence, the Hindu tantric scriptures refer to techniques for achieving a result.

The Hindu tantras total 92 scriptures; of these, 64 are purely &quot;Abheda&quot; (literally &quot;without differentiation&quot;, or monistic), known as the Bhairava Tantras or Kashmir Śaivite Tantras, 18 are &quot;Bhedābheda&quot; (literally &quot;with differentiation and without differentiation&quot; monistic or dualistic), known as the Rudra Tantras), and 10 are completely &quot;Bheda&quot; (literally &quot;differentiated&quot; or dualistic), known as the Tantras. The latter two (&quot;Rudra&quot; Tantras and &quot;&quot; Tantras) are used by the Śaiva Siddhāntins, and thus are sometimes referred to as Shaiva Siddhanta Tantras, or Śaiva Siddhānta &quot;Āgamas&quot;.

Tantra are mainly two types: Agama and Nigama. Agamas are those texts in which Goddess asked questions and the God replied. In Nigama texts, God asked questions and Goddess replied. This dialogue between God and Goddess is special feature of Hindu Tantra.

==Origin==
In the Nāth Tradition, legend ascribes the origin of tantra to Dattatreya, a semi-mythological yogi and the assumed author of the Jivanmukta Gita (&quot;Song of the liberated soul&quot;). Matsyendranath is credited with authorship of the Kaulajñāna-nirnāya, a voluminous ninth-century tantra dealing with a host of mystical and magical subjects. This work occupies an important position in the Hindu tantric lineage, as well as in Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism.

==Function==
In distinction to Vedic ritual, which is traditionally performed out-of-doors without idols or emblems, the Tantric ritual is largely a matter of temples and idols. The tantras are largely descriptions and specifications for the construction and maintenance of temple structures with their resident idols and lingas, for example is the &quot;Ajita Māhātantra&quot;.

Another function was the conservation of esoteric texts for the exclusive use of rulers in rituals directed to deities controlling political affairs, for example the &quot;Śārada-tilaka Tantra&quot;.

==Texts==
Tantric texts are usually associated with a particular tradition and deity. The different types of Tantric literature are tantra, Āgama, saṃhitā, sūtra, upaniṣad, purāṇa, tīkā (commentaries), prakaraṇa, paddhati texts, stotram, kavaca, nighaṇṭu, koṣa and hagiographical literature.

===Translations===
Most Hindu Tantras remain untranslated. One widely translated exception is the Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra, which according to Christopher Wallis, is atypical of most Tantric scriptures.

Sir John Woodroffe translated the &quot;Tantra of the Great Liberation (Mahānirvāna Tantra)&quot; (1913) into English along with other Tantric texts. Other tantras which have been translated into a Western language include the Malini-vijayottara tantra, the Kirana tantra, and the Parakhya Tantra.

<doc id="321991" wikidata="Q285714" url="?curid=321991" title="Northern Ireland Assembly">
<text>The Northern Ireland Assembly (; ), often referred to by the metonym &quot;Stormont&quot;, is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast.

The Assembly is a unicameral, democratically elected body comprising 90 members known as members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Members are elected under the single transferable vote form of proportional representation (STV-PR). In turn, the Assembly selects most of the ministers of the Northern Ireland Executive using the principle of power-sharing under the D&#x27;Hondt method to ensure that Northern Ireland&#x27;s largest voting blocs, British unionists and Irish nationalists, both participate in governing the region. The Assembly&#x27;s standing orders allow for certain contentious motions to require a cross-community vote; in addition to requiring the support of an overall majority of members, such votes must also be supported by a majority within both blocs in order to pass.

The Assembly is one of two &quot;mutually inter-dependent&quot; institutions created under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the other being the North/South Ministerial Council with the Republic of Ireland. The Agreement aimed to end Northern Ireland&#x27;s violent 30-year Troubles. The first Assembly election was held in June 1998.

==History==

===Previous legislatures===
From June 1921 until March 1972, the devolved legislature for Northern Ireland was the Parliament of Northern Ireland, established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and meeting from 1932 at Stormont, outside Belfast. Due to gerrymandering practices, the Parliament always had an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) majority and always elected a UUP administration. For its first two elections it used proportional representation (Single transferable voting) but switched to First-past-the-post voting in 1929.

It was suspended by the UK Government on 30 March 1972 and formally abolished in 1973 under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.

Northern Ireland was subsequently administered by direct rule until 1999, with a brief exception in 1974. Attempts began to restore on a new basis that would see power shared between nationalists and unionists. To this end a new legislature, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established in 1973 with a power-sharing Executive taking office in January 1974. However, this body was brought down by the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike in May 1974. Political discussions continued against the continued backdrop of the Troubles. In 1982, another Northern Ireland Assembly was established, initially as a body to scrutinise the actions of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Secretary of State, the UK Government minister with responsibility for Northern Ireland. It was not supported by Irish nationalists and was officially dissolved in 1986.

===1998–2002===
The Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998 formally established the Assembly in law under the name New Northern Ireland Assembly, in accordance with the Good Friday (or Belfast) Agreement. The first election of members of the New Northern Ireland Assembly was on 25 June 1998 and it first met on 1 July 1998. However, it only existed in &quot;shadow&quot; form until 2 December 1999 when full powers were devolved to the Assembly. Since then the Assembly has operated with several interruptions and has been suspended on six occasions:
* 11 February – 30 May 2000
* 10 August 2001 (24-hour suspension)
* 22 September 2001 (24-hour suspension)
* 14 October 2002 – 7 May 2007
* 9 January 2017 – 11 January 2020
* 2022 - 3 February 2024

Attempts to secure its operation on a permanent basis were initially frustrated by disagreements between the two main unionist parties (the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Ulster Unionist Party) and Sinn Féin. Unionist representatives refused to participate in the Good Friday Agreement&#x27;s institutions alongside Sinn Féin until they were assured that the IRA had discontinued its activities, decommissioned its weapons, and disbanded.

===2002–2007 (suspension)===
The Assembly&#x27;s suspension from October 2002 to May 2007 occurred when unionist parties withdrew from the Northern Ireland Executive after Sinn Féin&#x27;s offices at Stormont were raided by police, who were investigating allegations of intelligence gathering on behalf of the IRA by members of the party&#x27;s support staff. The Assembly, already suspended, was dissolved on 28 April 2003 as scheduled, but the elections due the following month were postponed by the UK Government and were not held until November that year.

Although the Assembly remained suspended from 2002 until 2007, the members elected at the 2003 Assembly election were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006 to meet in an Assembly to be technically known as &quot;the Assembly established under the Northern Ireland Act 2006&quot; for the purpose of electing a First Minister and deputy First Minister and choosing the members of an Executive before 25 November 2006 as a preliminary to the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive.

Multi-party talks in October 2006 resulted in the St Andrews Agreement, wherein Sinn Féin committed to support the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the mechanism for nominating First and deputy First Ministers was changed. In May 2006, Ian Paisley, leader of the DUP, had refused Sinn Féin&#x27;s nomination to be First Minister alongside Sinn Féin&#x27;s chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, as deputy First Minister; after the St Andrews Agreement, these positions were now chosen by larger parties only, while the holders of other positions were elected by sitting MLAs. Eileen Bell was appointed by the Secretary of State, Peter Hain, to be the interim speaker of the Assembly, with Francie Molloy and Jim Wells acting as deputy speakers. The Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006 repealed the Northern Ireland Act 2006 and disbanded &quot;the Assembly&quot;.

The St Andrews Agreement Act provided for a &quot;Transitional Assembly established under the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006&quot; – to continue to contribute to preparations for the restoration of devolved government. A person who was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly was also a member of the Transitional Assembly, with the same speaker and deputy speaker as elected for &quot;the Assembly&quot;. The Transitional Assembly first met on 24 November 2006 but proceedings were suspended due to a bomb threat by loyalist paramilitary Michael Stone. It was dissolved on 30 January 2007 when the election campaign for the next Northern Ireland Assembly started.

Subsequently, a new election to the suspended Northern Ireland Assembly was held on 7 March 2007. The DUP and Sinn Féin consolidated their positions as the two largest parties in the election and agreed to enter government together. Peter Hain signed a restoration order on 25 March 2007 allowing for the restoration of devolution at midnight on the following day. An administration was eventually established on 10 May with Ian Paisley as First Minister and Martin McGuinness as deputy First Minister.

=== 2007–2017 ===
This third Assembly was the first legislature in Northern Ireland to complete a full term since the Northern Ireland Parliament which convened between 1965 and 1969 and saw powers in relation to policing and justice transferred from Westminster on 12 April 2010. Peter Robinson succeeded Ian Paisley as First Minister and DUP leader in 2008.

A five-year term came into effect with the fourth Assembly elected in 2011. The subsequent period was dominated by issues of culture and dealing with the past which culminated in the Fresh Start Agreement in 2014. The first Official Opposition in the Assembly was formed by the UUP in the closing months of the fourth term. Following the election of the fifth Assembly in 2016, the DUP and Sinn Féin formed the fourth Executive, with Arlene Foster as First Minister and Martin McGuinness continuing deputy First Minister.

=== 2017–2020 (suspension) ===
In the wake of the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, McGuinness resigned from his post in January 2017, bringing an end to almost a decade of unbroken devolution. Sinn Féin withdrew from the Assembly, and a fresh election was held on 2 March 2017. Negotiations mediated by then Secretary of State James Brokenshire missed the three-week deadline provided in law for the formation of an Executive. The passing of an extended legal deadline of 29 June left decisions on funding allocations in the hands of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and a budget for the ongoing 2017–18 financial year was passed by the UK Parliament. Over time, further legislation was passed for Northern Ireland at Westminster, repeatedly extending the deadline for Executive formation although no direct rule ministers were appointed during this suspension. In 2019, the UK Parliament enacted one such Bill to legalise same-sex marriage and liberalise abortion, in line with Great Britain (the rest of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland.

===2020–2022 ===
Talks eventually succeeded under a third Secretary of State Julian Smith. The sixth Assembly resumed on 11 January 2020, shortly before the UK&#x27;s exit from the European Union.

In February 2021, DUP MLAs threatened to bring down the Assembly and force an early election in protest at Boris Johnson&#x27;s Brexit deal, which would put a border in the Irish Sea.

On 3 February 2022, First Minister Paul Givan of the DUP resigned. Due to the power-sharing arrangements, this also caused the deputy First Minister to lose her position.

=== 2022–2024 (suspension) ===
Elections were held for a seventh assembly in May 2022. Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party, followed by the Democratic Unionist Party. The newly elected assembly met for the first time on 13 May 2022 and again on 30 May. However, at both these meetings, the DUP refused to assent to the election of a speaker as part of a protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol, which meant that the assembly could not continue other business, including the appointment of a new Executive. The incumbent speaker and incumbent ministers continued in office in caretaker roles.

After the deadline set by Westminster for restoring devolved government was missed, the Northern Ireland secretary was legally required to schedule the election in the following 12 weeks. However, the secretary extended the deadline for the formation of the executive by six weeks, with an option for a further six week extension, so that any Northern Ireland Assembly election that would occur due to a failure to form an executive would happen at some point in 2023. Further extension of the deadline to 8 February 2024 was brought about by legislation in the Westminster Parliament as a result of continued refusal by the DUP to form an executive.

=== Since 2024 ===

On 30 January 2024, leader of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson announced that the DUP would restore an executive government on the condition that new legislation was passed by the UK House of Commons. A sitting of the assembly was called for 3 February 2024 at which Edwin Poots was elected as Speaker and a new executive led by Michelle O&#x27;Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly was formed, restoring devolved government in Northern Ireland.

==Powers and functions==
The Assembly has both legislative powers and responsibility for electing the Northern Ireland Executive. The First and deputy First Ministers were initially elected on a cross-community vote, although this was changed in 2006 and they are now appointed as leaders of the largest parties of the largest and second largest Assembly &#x27;block&#x27; (understood to mean &#x27;Unionist&#x27;, &#x27;Nationalist&#x27; and &#x27;Other&#x27;). The Minister of Justice is appointed by cross-community agreement. The seven other ministerial positions are distributed among willing parties roughly proportionate to their share of seats in the Assembly by the D&#x27;Hondt method, with ministers chosen by the nominating officers of each party.

The Assembly has authority to legislate in a field of competences known as &quot;transferred matters&quot;. These matters are not explicitly given in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Rather they include any competence not explicitly retained by the Parliament at Westminster. Powers reserved by Westminster are divided into &quot;excepted matters&quot;, which it retains indefinitely, and &quot;reserved matters&quot;, which may be transferred to the competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly at a future date. A list of transferred, reserved and excepted matters is given below.

While the Assembly was in suspension, its legislative powers were exercised by the UK Government, which governs through procedures at Westminster. Laws that would have normally been within the competence of the Assembly were passed by the UK Parliament in the form of Orders-in-Council rather than Acts of the Assembly.

Further, when the Assembly is suspended, certain devolved matters revert to the remit of the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC). The BIIGC guarantees the Government of Ireland a say in areas of bilateral co-operation and on those matters not yet devolved to the Assembly or the North/South Ministerial Council.

Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly as with other subordinate legislatures are subject to judicial review. A law can be struck down if it is found to:
* exceed the competences of the Assembly;
* violate retained European Union law;
* are incompatible with human rights as codified in the European Convention on Human Rights; or
* discriminate against individuals on the grounds of political opinion or religious belief.

===Transferred matters===
A transferred matter is defined as &quot;any matter which is not an excepted or reserved matter&quot;. There is therefore no full listing of transferred matters but they have been grouped into the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Executive ministers:
* Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs
* Communities
* Economy
* Education
* Finance
* Health
* Infrastructure
* Justice
* First and deputy First Minister
===Reserved matters===
Reserved matters are outlined in Schedule 3 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998:
* Navigation (including merchant shipping)
* Civil aviation
* The foreshore, sea bed and subsoil and their natural resources
* Postal services
* Import and export controls, external trade
* National minimum wage
* Financial services
* Financial markets
* Intellectual property
* Units of measurement
* Telecommunications, Broadcasting, Internet services
* The National Lottery
* Xenotransplantation
* Surrogacy
* Human fertilisation and embryology
* Human genetics
* Consumer safety in relation to goods

===Excepted matters===
Excepted matters are outlined in Schedule 2 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998:
* The Crown
* Parliament
* International relations
* Defence
* Immigration and Nationality
* Taxation
* National insurance
* Elections
* Currency
* National security
* Nuclear energy
* Outer space
* Activities in Antarctica

==Procedure==
The Assembly has three primary mechanisms to ensure effective power-sharing:
* in appointing ministers to the Executive (except for the Minister of Justice), the D&#x27;Hondt method is followed so that ministerial portfolios are divided among the parties in proportion to their strength in the Assembly. This means that all parties with a significant number of seats are entitled to at least one minister;
* certain resolutions must receive &quot;cross community support&quot;, or the support of a minimum number of MLAs from both communities, to be passed by the Assembly. Every MLA is officially designated as either nationalist, unionist or other. The election of the speaker, appointment of the Minister of Justice, any changes to the standing orders and the adoption of certain money bills must all occur with cross-community support. The election of the First and deputy First Ministers previously occurred by parallel consent but the positions are now filled by appointment; and
* Most votes taken by the Assembly can be made dependent on cross-community support if a petition of concern is presented to the speaker. A petition of concern may be brought by 30 or more MLAs, with at least two parties or independent members who were elected to the Assembly as independents in the most recent election being represented among the petitioners. Petitions may not be brought on resolutions relating to sanctions of members, on votes relating to the general principles of a bill rather than specific provisions or passage, and matters relating to the full implementation of paragraph 2.2.4 of Annex B of Part 2 of The New Decade, New Approach Deal as specified in the standing orders of the Assembly. In cases where a petition is properly filed, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a given community agree, that community (or a sufficiently large party in that community) can exercise a veto over the Assembly&#x27;s decisions. The purpose is to protect each community from legislation that would favour the other community.

The Assembly has the power to call for witnesses and documents, if the relevant responsibility has been transferred to its remit. Proceedings are covered by privilege in defamation law.
==Composition==
The Assembly&#x27;s composition is laid down in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. It initially had 108 members (MLAs) elected from 18 six-member constituencies on the basis of universal adult suffrage and the single transferable vote.

Under the Assembly Members (Reduction of Numbers) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 the number of MLAs per constituency was reduced from 6 to 5, leaving a total of 90 seats. This took effect at the March 2017 election. The constituencies used are the same as those used for elections to the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster.

The Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that, unless the Assembly is dissolved early, elections should occur once every four years on the first Thursday in May. The Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 was passed to bring the Northern Ireland Assembly into line with the other devolved legislatures and to extend each Assembly term to five years instead of four. The second election to the Assembly was delayed by the UK government until 26 November 2003. The Assembly is dissolved shortly before the holding of elections on a day chosen by the Secretary of State. After each election the Assembly must meet within eight days. The Assembly can vote to dissolve itself early by a two-thirds majority of the total number of its members. It is also automatically dissolved if it is unable to elect a First Minister and deputy First Minister (effectively joint first ministers, the only distinction being in the titles) within six weeks of its first meeting or of those positions becoming vacant. There have been six elections to the Assembly since 1998.

=== Designations ===
The Assembly uses a consociational system. Each MLA is free to designate themselves as &quot;Nationalist&quot;, &quot;Unionist&quot;, or &quot;other&quot;, as they see fit, the only requirement being that no member may change their designation more than once during an Assembly session.

The system has been criticised by some, in particular the cross-community Alliance Party, as entrenching sectarian divisions. Alliance supports ending the official designation of identity requirement and the taking of important votes on the basis of an ordinary super-majority, as does the largest unionist party, the DUP.

===Executive and Opposition===
Which parties can appoint ministers to the Northern Ireland Executive is determined by a combination of mandatory coalition, the D&#x27;Hondt method and cross-community support, depending on the role, as explained above. Coalitions of between three and five parties have governed over the Assembly&#x27;s history. The Executive of the Sixth Assembly was formed on 11 January 2020.
Unlike the United Kingdom Parliament and the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament), the Assembly had no provision for an official opposition to hold governing parties to account until legislation was passed in 2016. A party may now form or join an Assembly Opposition, granting it additional speaking, scrutiny and funding rights, if it was entitled to Ministerial roles under the D&#x27;Hondt method and declined them, or if it wins 8% or more of the seats. This opportunity was qualified for and taken by the UUP and SDLP following the 2016 election. Even within the Executive, however, the parties (which have collectively held large majorities in the Assembly) have frequently voted against each other due to political and/or policy differences.

===Historical participation===
Alongside independents, a total of 15 parties have held seats in the Assembly since 1998:

Unionist:
* Ulster Unionist Party
* Democratic Unionist Party
* Progressive Unionist Party
* UK Independence Party
* Traditional Unionist Voice
* NI21
* United Unionist Coalition
* UK Unionist Party
* Northern Ireland Unionist Party
Nationalist:
* Social Democratic and Labour Party
* Sinn Féin
Other:
* Alliance Party of Northern Ireland
* Green Party Northern Ireland
* People Before Profit
* Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition

===Election results and changes===

The course of the Assembly saw a marked shift in party allegiance among voters. At the 2003 election, the DUP and Sinn Féin displaced the more moderate UUP and SDLP as the largest parties in the unionist and nationalist blocks. The parties only agreed to share power after four years of negotiations and a new election.

The DUP, Sinn Féin, SDLP and UUP have remained the largest parties in the Assembly and so far the only ones entitled to ministerial roles in the Executive under the D&#x27;Hondt method. However, there has been growing support for parties designated &quot;Other&quot;. The centrist Alliance party secured the roles of Speaker from 1998 to 2007 and Minister of Justice from 2010 to 2016 (and again from 11 January 2020) thanks to cross-community support, and has seen an increase in its seat wins from 6 to 8. While the NI Women&#x27;s Coalition disbanded in 2003, two leftist parties, the Green Party in Northern Ireland and People Before Profit, won their first seats, in 2007 and 2016, respectively.

A rapidly shifting landscape of smaller unionist parties has also been a feature of the Assembly. In 1999 the UK Unionist Party lost four of its five MLAs, disagreeing over a protest against Sinn Féin. The four formed the NI Unionist Party, which again suffered a split and won no seats in the 2003 election. That election also saw the electoral demise of a loose trio of independently elected unionists who had united as the United Unionist Coalition. Minor unionist parties flourished again after the 2011 election, which saw the disappearance of the PUP from the Assembly and the election of the TUV, a splinter group from the DUP opposed to the St Andrews Agreement. In 2012, a suspended UUP member became UKIP&#x27;s first MLA, and in 2013, two UUP MLAs resigned to form the progressive NI21, which later split. Of these only the TUV survived the 2016 and 2017 elections.

Disagreements within the Executive precipitated the resignation of the UUP in 2015, and following the 2016 election they and the SDLP formed the first Assembly Opposition. The row also saw Alliance relinquish its Justice role, joining the Greens, PBPA and TUV in unofficial opposition. Independent unionist Claire Sugden gained the cross-community support needed to take over the Ministry of Justice.

A 5th Executive was formed on 11 January 2020 following the 2017 election results, which saw the unionist block lose its Assembly majority for the first time. The usual four largest parties had won enough seats to win ministerial roles under D&#x27;Hondt (the DUP three, Sinn Féin two and the SDLP and UUP one each provided neither of them choose to enter opposition). With the reduction in the number of Assembly seats, the 8% threshold now amounts to eight rather than nine seats, qualifying Alliance to enter official opposition had they chosen to so, which they did not. The Greens retained their two seats and the TUV and Claire Sugden their single seats, while People Before Profit now held only one seat.

The 6th Executive, formed on 3 February 2024, is notable in several respects: Sinn Féin became the largest party in the 2022 election and took the role of First Minister as well as both economic portfolios, and the SDLP for the first time did not qualify for any seats in the Executive, instead forming the Official Opposition.

The table below details changes in members&#x27; allegiances and parties&#x27; seat possessions.

=== Election results by constituency ===
Some parties, which rarely or never won seats in the same constituency, are grouped together for ease of reading. For further clarity, see footnotes on headers.

===Co-options===
Vacancies between Assembly elections are filled by co-option. A by-election is still available as an option if the nominated person cannot take his or her seat but none have been held.

The possibility of by-elections or co-options was established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998. In 2001, the Northern Ireland Office introduced a system of substitutes as the preferred option. Under a further change made in 2009, a political party leader directly nominates a new MLA if his or her party won that seat at the previous election. Independent MLAs can continue to use substitutes. 

When Sinn Féin MLA Michael Ferguson died in September 2006, no substitutes were available. Sinn Féin was allowed to use his vote in the Assembly (despite his death) and no by-election was held. His seat remained vacant until the 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election.

Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament), uses the same single transferable vote system for elections as the Assembly but does allow by-elections to fill vacancies. This method is also used for the seats chosen by election in the upper house, Seanad Éireann.

==Organisation==
The Assembly is chaired by the speaker and three deputy speakers, of whom one is appointed Principal Deputy Speaker. Lord Alderdice served as the first speaker of the Assembly from July 1998, but retired in March 2004 to serve as a member of the Independent Monitoring Commission that supervised paramilitary ceasefires. The position is currently held by the Democratic Unionist Party MLA Edwin Poots. In the Assembly, the speaker and ten other members constitute a quorum.

The Assembly Commission is the body corporate of the Assembly with all that that entails. It looks after the pay and pensions of members directly and through tax-payer funded appointees, and the interests of political parties. The very first bill of the Assembly was to do with members&#x27; pensions and was taken through with minimum ado by a member of the commission.

The Assembly has 9 statutory committees, each of which is charged with scrutinising the activities of a single ministerial department. It also has 6 permanent standing committees and can establish temporary ad hoc committees. The chairmen and deputy chairmen of the committees are chosen by party nominating officers under the d&#x27;Hondt system procedure, used to appoint most ministers. Ordinary committee members are not appointed under this procedure but the Standing Orders require that the share of members of each party on a committee should be roughly proportionate to its share of seats in the Assembly. Committees of the Assembly take decisions by a simple majority vote. The following are the current statutory and standing committees of the Assembly:

===Statutory (departmental) committees===
* Executive Office Committee
* Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Committee
* Communities Committee
* Economy Committee
* Education Committee
* Finance Committee
* Health Committee
* Infrastructure Committee
* Justice Committee

===Standing committees===
* Assembly and Executive Review Committee
* Audit Committee
* Business Committee
* Procedures Committee
* Public Accounts Committee
* Standards and Privileges Committee

<text>James Benson Irwin (March 17, 1930 – August 8, 1991) was an American astronaut, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, and a United States Air Force pilot. He served as Lunar Module pilot for Apollo 15, the fourth human lunar landing. He was the 8th person to walk on the Moon.

==Early life and education==
Irwin was born March 17, 1930, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, of Scottish, German (maternal side) and Irish descent, to parents James William Irwin (1896–1978), a U.S. Army World War I veteran, and Elsa Mathilda Irwin (; 1898–1993) who had German ancestry. Irwin&#x27;s paternal grandparents emigrated to the U.S. from Altmore Parish at Pomeroy in County Tyrone, Ireland (now Northern Ireland) around 1859. 

At about the age of 12, he informed his mother about his desire to go to the Moon, letting her know that he might be the first person to do so (he ended up being the eighth). He graduated from East High School in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1947. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in naval science from the United States Naval Academy in 1951, and Master of Science degrees in aeronautical engineering and instrumentation engineering from the University of Michigan in 1957.

He received initial flight training at Hondo Air Base and follow-up training at Reese Air Force Base, Texas. He graduated from the Air Force Experimental Flight Test Pilot School (Class 60C) in 1961, and the Aerospace Research Pilot School in 1963 (Class IV). Prior to joining NASA, he was chief of the Advanced Requirements Branch at Headquarters Air Defense Command. During his time in the United States Air Force he received the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal and two Air Force Commendation Medals. He also received an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award while with the 4750th Training Wing.

Irwin was also a developmental test pilot for the Lockheed YF-12, the Mach 3 fighter-interceptor variant which preceded the SR-71 Blackbird. His first flight of that aircraft was on the day that one of his five children was born.

In 1961, a student pilot that Irwin was training crashed the plane they were flying on a training mission. They both survived, but Irwin suffered compound fractures, amnesia, and nearly lost a leg. John Forrest, a U.S. Air Force orthopedic surgeon, was instrumental in preventing the amputation of Irwin&#x27;s leg.

During his military service, he accumulated more than 7,015 hours flying time, of which 5,300 hours were in jet aircraft.

== Personal life ==
Irwin was raised in a Christian household but stopped actively practicing the religion at age 10. He became a devout born-again Christian after returning from space. He was a Young Earth Creationist.

In 1952, Irwin married his first wife, who was a Catholic. The two had an unhappy marriage made worse by his devotion to his work. By his own account, the marriage failed after two years due to his poor, borderline cruel treatment of her, and he later stated that finding religion again made familial relationships much easier.

In 1959, Irwin married his second wife, the former Mary Ellen Monroe (born 1938). They were married until his death.

Irwin had five children.

==NASA career==

Irwin was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He was chosen as commander, with John S. Bull as lunar module pilot, for LTA-8, an environmental qualification test of the Apollo Lunar Module in a vacuum chamber at the Houston Space Environment Simulation Laboratory. He then served as a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 10, the first mission to carry the full Apollo stack to the Moon and the dry run for the first crewed Moon landing. Following that assignment, Irwin served as backup lunar module pilot for the second Moon landing mission, Apollo 12.

===Apollo 15===

Between July 26 and August 7, 1971 – as the Apollo 15 lunar module pilot (LMP) – Irwin logged 295 hours and 11 minutes in space. His extravehicular activity (EVA) on the Moon&#x27;s surface amounted to 18 hours and 35 minutes of the mission time, an additional 33 minutes was used for Commander David R. Scott to do a stand-up EVA by opening the LM&#x27;s docking hatch to survey the surroundings and take photographs. Irwin and David Scott&#x27;s mission was more science-based than previous missions, which meant that they received intensive geological training to meet the demanding nature of the J-Mission profile. This extra training is credited with allowing them to make one of the most important discoveries of the Apollo era, the Genesis Rock.

Apollo 15 landed in the Moon&#x27;s Hadley-Apennine region, noted for its mountains and rilles. As a J-Mission, they would spend more time on the Moon than previous missions, to allow for three EVAs. As well, Irwin was the first automobile passenger on the Moon as Scott drove the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) carried along for this mission in the lunar module (LM) Falcon&#x27;s Descent Stage. Scott and Irwin&#x27;s stay on the Moon was just under three days at 66 hours and 54 minutes.

Once the rendezvous procedure was completed between &quot;Falcon&quot; and the &quot;Endeavour&quot; CSM, Irwin and Scott were busy moving items like rock samples into the CSM and preparing the lunar module for final separation. During this intense period of work the earliest symptoms of a heart condition appeared. Both Scott and Irwin had been working with no sleep for 23 hours, during which they conducted a final moonwalk, performed the ascent from the lunar surface, rendezvoused with &quot;Endeavour&quot;, and encountered the problems that delayed the lunar module jettison maneuver. The astronauts&#x27; physiological vital signs were being monitored back on Earth, and the flight surgeons noticed some irregularities in Irwin&#x27;s heart rhythms. Irwin&#x27;s heart had developed bigeminy. Charles Berry stated to Chris Kraft, deputy director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) at the time: &quot;It&#x27;s serious, [i]f he were on Earth. I&#x27;d have him in ICU being treated for a heart attack.&quot; However, Berry concluded that since &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s cabin atmosphere was 100% oxygen when in space, Irwin was in the best of circumstances. Specifically, &quot;In truth, ... he&#x27;s in an ICU. He&#x27;s getting one hundred percent oxygen, he&#x27;s being continuously monitored, and best of all, he&#x27;s in zero &quot;g&quot;. Whatever strain his heart is under, well, we can&#x27;t do better than zero &quot;g&quot;.&quot;

During the post-trans-Earth injection (TEI) phase of the mission there wasn&#x27;t much more for Irwin to do other than provide help with Al Worden&#x27;s EVA to retrieve film magazines from the CSM&#x27;s SIM bay, by donning a pressure suit and monitoring him. He was able to rest and apparently recover during the rest of the mission. The flight surgeons continued to monitor his EKG until splashdown, but his heart rhythm was normal. This incident was not discussed during the mission debriefing sessions, and the condition did not appear when he returned to Earth.

==Post-NASA career==
After the return of Apollo 15 to Earth, it was discovered that without authority the crew had taken 398 commemorative first day covers to the Moon of which a hundred were then sold to a German stamp dealer. The profits of the sale were intended to be used to establish trust funds for the children of Apollo 15&#x27;s crew. NASA had turned a blind eye to similar activities on earlier flights, but on this occasion the administration reprimanded the astronauts, and they never received any funds from the sales. Irwin had announced his intent to retire from the Air Force and resign from NASA prior to the reprimand. During a subsequent investigations by NASA, the Attorney General, and Congress, the astronauts surrendered the covers still in their possession; they were returned in 1983. &quot;Slate&quot; magazine opined that the action effectively exonerated the astronauts.

By his own admission, Irwin was not a committed Christian during his years at NASA. After his retirement as a colonel in 1972, Irwin founded the High Flight Foundation. He spent the next 20 years as a &quot;Goodwill Ambassador for the Prince of Peace&quot;, stating that &quot;Jesus walking on the earth is more important than man walking on the moon&quot;. He said that his experiences in space had made God more real to him than before. Irwin and his wife stated that his Christian rebirth, which happened while he was in space, saved their marriage and made their lives much happier.

Beginning in 1973, Irwin led several expeditions to Mount Ararat, Turkey, in search of the remains of Noah&#x27;s Ark. In 1982, he was injured during the descent and had to be transported down the mountain on horseback. In &quot;More Than Earthlings&quot;, Irwin wrote expressing his view that the Genesis creation narrative was real, literal history.

==Death==

Irwin suffered three major heart attacks. One occurred less than two years after Apollo 15, when Irwin was 43, while he was playing handball; he underwent an emergency triple bypass operation. Two months later he suffered a subsequent heart attack while skiing in Colorado. Irwin suffered another heart attack on June 6, 1986, when he collapsed during a run and was found pulseless on a curb. Doctors from NASA doubted the incidents were related to space travel, and noted that pre-flight testing indicated him having a tendency for cardiac arrhythmias during strenuous exercise.

On August 8, 1991, Irwin suffered another heart attack after a bicycle ride. Attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful, and Irwin died later that day. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He and his wife, Mary Ellen, to whom he was married for three decades, had five children.

Of the 12 men who have walked on the Moon, Irwin was the first to die. The James Irwin Charter Schools were founded in Colorado in his honor.

A patch cut by Irwin from a backpack abandoned on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission was auctioned at Christie&#x27;s in 2001 for $310,500 in a consignment of material from Irwin&#x27;s estate that garnered &quot;a combined $500,000&quot;.

==Organizations==
Irwin was a member of the Air Force Association and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He was also a Freemason, initiated in Tejon Lodge No. 104 in Colorado Springs. He was the third Freemason to set foot on the Moon, after Buzz Aldrin and Edgar Mitchell.

Irwin was a member of Civitan International, a nonprofit organization promoting community service, scientific research, and service to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

<text>&quot;Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī&quot; (&quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Own&quot;) is the anthem of the U.S. state of Hawaii. It previously served as the national anthem of the independent Hawaiian Kingdom during the late 19th century, as well as the short Republic of Hawaii, and has continued to be Hawaii&#x27;s official anthem ever since annexation by the United States in 1898.

==History==

The words were written in 1874 by King David Kalākaua with music composed by Captain Henri Berger, then the king&#x27;s royal bandmaster. &quot;Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī&quot; is one of the national anthems of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi and also was the national anthem of the Republic of Hawaiʻi.

It was adopted as the national anthem in 1876, replacing Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s composition &quot;He Mele Lāhui Hawaiʻi&quot;. It was the adopted song of the Territory of Hawaiʻi before becoming the state symbol by an act of the Hawaiʻi State Legislature in 1967. The melody is reminiscent of &quot;God Save the King&quot; and the Prussian anthem &quot;Heil dir im Siegerkranz&quot;. &quot;Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī&quot; is commonly sung at sporting events in Hawaii, immediately after the U.S. national anthem. It is sung at many local schools and Local Service Organization Meetings and Events.

In the Hawaiian language, &quot;Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī&quot; means &quot;Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Own&quot;.

<text>Errett Albert Bishop (July 14, 1928 – April 14, 1983) was an American mathematician known for his work on analysis. He is best known for developing constructive analysis in his 1967 &quot;Foundations of Constructive Analysis&quot;, where he proved most of the important theorems in real analysis using &quot;constructivist&quot; methods.

==Life==
Errett Bishop&#x27;s father, Albert T. Bishop, graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, ending his career as professor of mathematics at Wichita State University in Kansas. Although he died when Errett was less than 4 years old, he influenced Errett&#x27;s eventual career by the math texts he left behind, which is how Errett discovered mathematics. Errett grew up in Newton, Kansas. 
Errett and his sister were apparent math prodigies.

Bishop entered the University of Chicago in 1944, obtaining both the BS and MS in 1947. The doctoral studies he began in that year were interrupted by two years in the US Army, 1950–52, doing mathematical research at the National Bureau of Standards. He completed his Ph.D. in 1954 under Paul Halmos; his thesis was titled &quot;Spectral Theory for Operations on Banach Spaces&quot;.

Bishop taught at the University of California, 1954–65. He spent the 1964–65 academic year at the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Berkeley. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1961–62. From 1965 until his death, he was professor at the University of California at San Diego.

==Work==

Bishop&#x27;s work falls into five categories:
# Polynomial and rational approximation. Examples are extensions of Mergelyan&#x27;s approximation theorem and the theorem of Frigyes Riesz and Marcel Riesz concerning measures on the unit circle orthogonal to polynomials.
# The general theory of function algebras. Here Bishop worked on uniform algebras (commutative Banach algebras with unit whose norms are the spectral norms) proving results such as antisymmetric decomposition of a uniform algebra, the Bishop–DeLeeuw theorem, and the proof of existence of Jensen measures. Bishop wrote a 1965 survey &quot;Uniform algebras,&quot; examining the interaction between the theory of uniform algebras and that of several complex variables. 
# Banach spaces and operator theory, the subject of his thesis. He introduced what is now called the Bishop condition, useful in the theory of decomposable operators. 
# The theory of functions of several complex variables. An example is his 1962 &quot;Analyticity in certain Banach spaces.&quot; He proved important results in this area such as the biholomorphic embedding theorem for a Stein manifold as a closed submanifold in formula_1, and a new proof of Remmert&#x27;s proper mapping theorem. 
# Constructive mathematics. Bishop became interested in foundational issues while at the Miller Institute. His now-famous &quot;Foundations of Constructive Analysis&quot; (1967) aimed to show that a constructive treatment of analysis is feasible, something about which Weyl had been pessimistic. A 1985 revision, called &quot;Constructive Analysis&quot;, was completed with the assistance of Douglas Bridges.

In 1972, Bishop (with Henry Cheng) published &quot;Constructive Measure Theory&quot;. 

In the later part of his life, Bishop was seen as the leading mathematician in the area of constructivist mathematics. In 1966, he was invited to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians on that theme. His talk was titled &quot;The Constructivisation of Abstract Mathematical Analysis.&quot; The American Mathematical Society invited him to give four hour-long lectures as part of the Colloquium Lectures series. The title of his lectures was &quot;Schizophrenia of Contemporary Mathematics.&quot; Abraham Robinson wrote of Bishop&#x27;s work in constructivist mathematics: &quot;Even those who are not willing to accept Bishop&#x27;s basic philosophy must be impressed with the great analytical power displayed in his work.&quot; Robinson, however, wrote in his review of Bishop&#x27;s book that Bishop&#x27;s historical commentary is &quot;more vigorous than accurate&quot;.

==Quotes==
*(A) &quot;Mathematics is common sense&quot;; 
*(B) &quot;Do not ask whether a statement is true until you know what it means&quot;; 
*(C) &quot;A proof is any completely convincing argument&quot;;
*(D) &quot;Meaningful distinctions deserve to be preserved&quot;.
:(Items A through D are principles of constructivism from his (Reprinted in Rosenblatt 1985.)
*&quot;The primary concern of mathematics is number, and this means the positive integers. . . . In the words of Kronecker, the positive integers were created by God. Kronecker would have expressed it even better if he had said that the positive integers were created by God for the benefit of man (and other finite beings). Mathematics belongs to man, not to God. We are not interested in properties of the positive integers that have no descriptive meaning for finite man. When a man proves a positive integer to exist, he should show how to find it. If God has mathematics of his own that needs to be done, let him do it himself.&quot; (Bishop 1967, Chapter 1, A Constructivist Manifesto, page 2)
*&quot;We are not contending that idealistic mathematics is worthless from the constructive point of view. This would be as silly as contending that unrigorous mathematics is worthless from the classical point of view. Every theorem proved with idealistic methods presents a challenge: to find a constructive version, and to give it a constructive proof.&quot; (Bishop 1967, Preface, page x)
*&quot;Theorem 1 is the famous theorem of Cantor, that the real numbers are uncountable. The proof is essentially Cantor&#x27;s &#x27;diagonal&#x27; proof. Both Cantor&#x27;s theorem and his method of proof are of great importance.&quot; (Bishop 1967, Chapter 2, Calculus and the Real Numbers, page 25)
*&quot;The real numbers, for certain purposes, are too thin. Many beautiful phenomena become fully visible only when the complex numbers are brought to the fore.&quot; (Bishop 1967, Chapter 5, Complex Analysis, page 113)
*&quot;It is clear that many of the results in this book could be programmed for a computer, by some such procedure as that indicated above. In particular, it is likely that most of the results of Chaps. 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11 could be presented as computer programs. As an example, a complete separable metric space &quot;X&quot; can be described by a sequence of real numbers, and therefore by a sequence of integers, simply by listing the distances between each pair of elements of a given countable dense set. . . . As written, this book is person-oriented rather than computer-oriented. It would be of great interest to have a computer-oriented version.&quot; (Bishop 1967, Appendix B, Aspects of Constructive Truth, pages 356 and 357)
*&quot;Very possibly classical mathematics will cease to exist as an independent discipline&quot; (Bishop, 1970, p. 54)
*&quot;Brouwer&#x27;s criticisms of classical mathematics were concerned with what I shall refer to as &#x27;the debasement of meaning (Bishop in Rosenblatt, 1985, page 1)

<text>Sir Michael Victor Berry (born 14 March 1941 in Frimley) is a British theoretical physicist. He is the Melville Wills Professor of Physics (Emeritus) at the University of Bristol.

He is known for the Berry phase, a phenomenon observed in both quantum mechanics and classical optics, as well as Berry connection and curvature. He specializes in semiclassical physics (asymptotic physics, quantum chaos), applied to wave phenomena in quantum mechanics and other areas such as optics.

==Early life and education==
Berry was brought up in a Jewish family and was the son of a London taxi driver and a dressmaker. Berry earned a BSc in physics from the University of Exeter in 1962 where he met his first wife (a sociology student with whom he had his first child) and a PhD from the University of St. Andrews in 1965. His thesis is titled &quot;The diffraction of light by ultrasound&quot;.

==Career and research==
He has spent his whole career at the University of Bristol. He was a research fellow, 1965–67; lecturer, 1967–74; reader, 1974–78; Professor of Physics, 1978–88; and Royal Society Research Professor 1988–2006. Since 2006, he has been Melville Wills Professor of Physics (Emeritus) at Bristol University.

==Awards and honours==
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1982 and knighted in 1996. From 2006 to 2012 he was editor of&quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society A&quot;.

<doc id="322003" wikidata="Q741846" url="?curid=322003" title="Perpetuity">
<text>In finance, a perpetuity is an annuity that has no end, or a stream of cash payments that continues forever. There are few actual perpetuities in existence. For example, the United Kingdom (UK) government issued them in the past; these were known as consols and were all finally redeemed in 2015. 

Real estate and preferred stock are among some types of investments that effect the results of a perpetuity, and prices can be established using techniques for valuing a perpetuity. Perpetuities are but one of the time value of money methods for valuing financial assets. 

Perpetuities can be structured as a perpetual bond and are a form of ordinary annuities. The concept is closely linked to terminal value and terminal growth rate in valuation.

==Detailed description==
A perpetuity is an annuity in which the periodic payments begin on a fixed date and continue indefinitely. It is sometimes referred to as a perpetual annuity. Fixed coupon payments on permanently invested (irredeemable) sums of money are prime examples of perpetuities. Scholarships paid perpetually from an endowment fit the definition of perpetuity.

The value of the perpetuity is finite because receipts that are anticipated far in the future have extremely low present value (present value of the future cash flows). Unlike a typical bond, because the principal is never repaid, there is no present value for the principal. Assuming that payments begin at the &quot;end&quot; of the current period, the price of a perpetuity is simply the coupon amount over the appropriate discount rate or yield; that is,

:formula_1

where PV = present value of the perpetuity, A = the amount of the periodic payment, and r = yield, discount rate or interest rate.

To give a numerical example, a 3% UK government war loan will trade at 50 pence per pound in a yield environment of 6%, while at 3% yield it is trading at par. That is, if the face value of the loan is £100 and the annual payment £3, the value of the loan is £50 when market interest rates are 6%, and £100 when they are 3%.

The duration, or the price-sensitivity to a small change in the interest rate r, of a perpetuity is given by the following formula:

: formula_2

This of course follows the fact that for bigger changes the new price must be calculated with the present-value formula given that for changes greater than a few basis-points the calculated duration is not reflective of the true-change in price.

==Real-life examples==
Valuing real estate with a capitalization rate or cap rate (the convention used in real estate finance) is a more current example. Using a cap rate, the value of a particular real estate asset is either the net income or the net cash flow of the property, divided by the cap rate. Effectively, the use of a cap rate to value a piece of real estate assumes that the current income from the property continues in perpetuity. Underlying this valuation is the assumption that rents will rise at the same rate as inflation. Although the property may be sold in future (or even the very near future), the assumption is that other investors will apply the same valuation approach to the property.

UK government perpetuities (called consols) were undated as well as irredeemable except by act of Parliament. As with war bonds, they paid fixed coupons (interest payments), and traded actively in the bond market until the government redeemed them in 2015. Very long dated bonds have financial characteristics that can appeal to some investors and in some circumstances: &quot;e.g.&quot; long-dated bonds have prices that change rapidly (either up or down) when yields change (fall or rise) in the financial markets.

The constant growth dividend discount model for the valuation of the common stock of a corporation is another example. This model assumes that the market price per share is equal to the discounted stream of all future dividends, which is assumed to be perpetual. If the discount rate for stocks (shares) with this level of systematic risk is 12.50%, then a constant perpetuity of dividend income per dollar is eight dollars. However, if the future dividends represent a perpetuity increasing at 5.00% per year, then the dividend discount model, in effect, subtracts 5.00% off the discount rate of 12.50% for 7.50% implying that the price per dollar of income is $13.33.

<text>In mathematics, an almost perfect number (sometimes also called slightly defective or least deficient number) is a natural number &quot;n&quot; such that the sum of all divisors of &quot;n&quot; (the sum-of-divisors function &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is equal to 2&quot;n&quot; − 1, the sum of all proper divisors of &quot;n&quot;, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) − &quot;n&quot;, then being equal to &quot;n&quot; − 1. The only known almost perfect numbers are powers of 2 with non-negative exponents . Therefore the only known odd almost perfect number is 20 = 1, and the only known even almost perfect numbers are those of the form 2&quot;k&quot; for some positive integer &quot;k&quot;; however, it has not been shown that all almost perfect numbers are of this form. It is known that an odd almost perfect number greater than 1 would have at least six prime factors.

If &quot;m&quot; is an odd almost perfect number then is a Descartes number. Moreover if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are positive odd integers such that formula_1 and such that and are both primes, then would be an odd weird number.

<text>The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, commonly known as Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (; abbreviated Queen&#x27;s or QUB), is a public research university in Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. The university received its charter in 1845 as part of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland and opened four years later, together with University of Galway (as &quot;Queen&#x27;s College, Galway&quot;) and University College Cork (as &quot;Queen&#x27;s College, Cork&quot;).

Queen&#x27;s offers approximately 300 academic degree programmes at various levels. The current president and vice-chancellor is Ian Greer. The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £474.2 million, of which £105.2 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £345.9 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;QUB Financial Statement 23/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen&#x27;s is a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the European University Association, Universities UK and Universities Ireland. The university is associated with two Nobel laureates and one Turing Award laureate.

==History==

Queen&#x27;s University Belfast has roots in the Belfast Academical Institution, which was founded in 1810 and which remains as the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. The present university was first chartered as &quot;Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast&quot; in 1845, when it was associated with the simultaneously founded Queen&#x27;s College, Cork, and Queen&#x27;s College, Galway, as part of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland – founded to encourage higher education for Catholics and Presbyterians, as a counterpart to Trinity College, Dublin, then an almost exclusively Anglican institution. Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast, opened in 1849. Its main building, the Lanyon Building, was designed by the English-born architect, Sir Charles Lanyon.
At its opening, it had 23 professors and 195 students. Some early students at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast took University of London examinations.
The Irish Universities Act 1908 dissolved the Royal University of Ireland, which had replaced the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland in 1879, and created two separate universities: the current National University of Ireland and Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast.

===Parliamentary representation===

The university was one of only eight United Kingdom universities to hold a parliamentary seat in the House of Commons at Westminster until such representation was abolished in 1950. The university was also represented in the Parliament of Northern Ireland from 1920 to 1968, when graduates elected four members.

==Contemporary university life==

On 20 June 2006, the university announced a £259 million investment programme focusing on facilities, recruitment and research. One of the outcomes of this investment has been a new university library; the McClay library was designed by Boston-based architects Shepley Bulfinch, working in association with Belfast architects, Robinson Patterson Partnership, and opened in July 2009. The building has been named in honour of Sir Allen McClay, a major benefactor of Queen&#x27;s University and of the Library.

In June 2010, the university announced the launch of a £7.5 million Ansin international research hub with Seagate Technology.

Also in that year, Queen&#x27;s was one of the largest employers in Northern Ireland, with a total workforce of 3,903, of whom 2,414 were members of academic, academic-related and research staff and 1,489 were administrative employees.

==Campus==


In addition to the main campus on the southern fringes of Belfast city centre, the university has two associated university colleges, St Mary&#x27;s and Stranmillis, located in the west and south-west of the city respectively. These colleges offer teacher training for those who wish to pursue teaching careers and a range of degree courses, all of which are centred around a liberal arts core.

Although the university refers to its main site as a campus, the university&#x27;s buildings are spread over a number of public streets in South Belfast; primarily, University Road, University Square, University Street, Malone Road and Stranmillis Road, with other departments located further afield such as in Titanic Quarter and Portaferry.

==Organisation and governance==

At year end, Queen&#x27;s had endowments of £70.9 million (2023 – £65.6 million) and total net assets of £658 million (2023 – £505.4 million). It holds the twentieth-largest endowment of any university in the UK.

==Academic profile==

=== Research ===
Queen&#x27;s University Belfast was admitted as a member of the self-appointed Russell Group of UK research-intensive universities in November 2006. In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), which assesses the quality of research in UK higher education institutions, the university is ranked 37th by GPA and 24th for research power (the grade point average score of a university, multiplied by the full-time equivalent number of researchers submitted).

=== Rankings and reputation ===
The &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; rankings 2018 placed Queen&#x27;s 32nd out of 93 in the UK. In the 2024 QS World University Rankings, Queen&#x27;s was ranked 204. It ranked 258th among the universities around the world by &quot;SCImago Institutions Rankings&quot;.

In the National Student Survey 2013, Queen&#x27;s was ranked 12th in the UK for student satisfaction.

Queen&#x27;s is ranked 204 in the world according to the 2023 QS World University Rankings. Research at the university includes investigations of cancer, sustainability, radiocarbon dating, wireless technology, creative writing, pharmaceuticals and sonic arts. In 2016, the university ranked 36th in the UK according to the &quot;Complete University Guide&quot;.

The university has been awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for Further and Higher Education on several occasions, including for work in comprehensive cancer services and improving survival rates for patients in Northern Ireland. In 2015, Queen&#x27;s was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for work in the field of engineering and technology

The university also holds a university-wide Athena SWAN Gold Award in recognition of work to support and transform gender equality in Higher Education and Research, thereby becoming the first university on the island of Ireland and only the second in the UK to achieve such an award.

=== Admissions ===

Entrants to Queen&#x27;s have, on average, 148 A/AS-level points and there are currently 6 applications per place, with about two-thirds of applicants coming from Northern Ireland and most apply for multiple courses. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; has described the Queen&#x27;s admissions policy as &quot;among the most socially inclusive in Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;. 99.5% of first degree entrants are from state schools, although this is mainly due to the lack of private schools in Northern Ireland. The university gives offers of admission to 86.1% of its applicants, the 3rd highest amongst the Russell Group.

In the academic year, the total student population was , of whom were undergraduates and postgraduates. In the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 87:4:9 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 56:44. There was also a total student population of 2,250 at its St Mary&#x27;s and Stranmillis university colleges as of 2013/2014.

The university was established with the aim of attracting both Protestant and Catholic students. While the university does not publish data on the religion affiliation of its students, Rupert Taylor, who conducted his PhD research on the university during The Troubles, argued in an article published in 1988 that &quot;Whilst in the past, especially before the Second World War, Catholics were under-represented this is not currently the case&quot;. Taylor cites data showing that Catholic representation among undergraduates rose from 21.9 per cent in 1958/59 to 27.4 per cent in 1968/69 and 42.5 per cent in 1978/79. By the late 1990s, 54 per cent of Queen&#x27;s students were Catholics, compared to a 48 per cent share of the Northern Ireland population aged 18–25. The growing share of Catholics in the student population is partially due to the tendency of middle-class Protestants to attend university in Great Britain rather than in Northern Ireland.

In 2009, Queen&#x27;s signed a joint venture partnership with INTO University Partnerships, creating INTO Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. The INTO centre is based on campus and provides a foundation year for international students who want to study at the university.

==Student life==

===Students&#x27; Union===
The Students&#x27; Union at Queen&#x27;s (QUBSU) is located opposite the Lanyon Building on University Road, and is provided for under the university&#x27;s statutes. All students at the university are automatic members of the union, making it one of the largest unions on a single campus in Ireland and the UK. It is administered by the Students&#x27; Representative Council (SRC) (elected every October, on a faculty basis) and an executive (elected in March), who manage the operations of the union in conjunction with several full-time staff.

The old union building closed at the end of August 2018 to make way for construction of the new Students&#x27; Union building. Interim facilities were provided in other university buildings on Elmwood Avenue and, for the Speakeasy bar, an acquired space on the Lisburn Road (opposite the Medical Biology Centre).

The new Students&#x27; Union building, officially named One Elmwood opened to students on 5 September 2022 and houses the Students&#x27; Union, Student Guidance Services, the Union bar, and Mandela Hall. It also houses a café called Social and a SPAR retail outlet under the name Union Shop.

====Union services====
The students&#x27; union provides services including an advice centre with full-time staff to help with issues such as money problems, accommodation and welfare. Commercial services including a shop, kitchen lounge area and coffee franchise are also provided by the union. The Mandela Hall hosts numerous concerts each year as well as the majority the students&#x27; union&#x27;s club nights. Student Disability, Student Wellbeing, Student Finance, Careers, Learning Development service and other services are also provided.
====Clubs and societies====
More than fifty sporting clubs and over one hundred non-sporting societies are recognised by the Students&#x27; Union Council and are therefore eligible to apply for an annual grant from the university. The oldest society in Queen&#x27;s University is the Literary and Scientific Society which focuses on debating political, cultural and social issues within Northern Ireland. Established in 1850 by Edwin Lawrence Godkin, the society has been very successful and produced some of the finest orators within Northern Ireland. The Dragonslayers Gaming Society hosts one of Ireland&#x27;s largest games conventions, Q-Con, in June of each year, and cultural groups such as An Cumann Gaelach and the Ulster-Scots Society are also present. There are a number of international societies at Queen&#x27;s, including the International Students Society and the Malaysian Students Society.

The Queen&#x27;s University Mountaineering Club is notable for producing three Everest summiteers including Ireland&#x27;s first, Dawson Stelfox. Roger McMorrow and Nigel Hart also summited in May 2007, and were subsequently jointly announced Queen&#x27;s University Graduates of the year for 2006/07 for their role in rescuing a young Nepalese climber left for dead near the summit.

QUB is one of only 20 universities in the United Kingdom to have an AIESEC local chapter, developing leadership, business and soft skills in highly motivated students, as well as providing international opportunities through their work abroad program.

===Housing===
Queen&#x27;s provides housing for both undergraduates and postgraduates, although many students live at home and commute. In 2005/06, 36% of Queen&#x27;s students lived in private accommodation within Belfast, 29% lived with parents or guardians, 20% in private accommodation outside of Belfast, and 10% lived in university maintained accommodation.
The university provides accommodation on a purpose-built student village called Elms Village, which has its own bar and shop, located on the Malone Road, south of the main campus, as well as in a number of houses in the South Belfast area, including at College Gardens and on Mount Charles.

===Cultural life===
The university had hosted the annual Belfast Festival at Queen&#x27;s since 1961 but announced in March 2015 that it would not continue to fund the festival.

It runs the hugely successful Queen&#x27;s Film Theatre, described as Northern Ireland&#x27;s leading independent cinema, the Brian Friel Theatre and an art gallery, the Naughton Gallery at Queen&#x27;s, which is a registered museum. In 2008 the Naughton Gallery was awarded the Times Higher Award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts. Housed in the Lanyon building since 2001 is a marble statue by Pio Fedi of the great physicist Galileo, portrayed deep in thought.

The International Students Society holds the annual Culture Shock event at Whitla Hall. By holding performances from the diverse student community, Queen&#x27;s provides one of the largest showcases of international culture in Northern Ireland.

===Sport===

Queen&#x27;s Physical Education Centre (abbreviated to and known widely as the PEC) is one of the largest sports centres in Ireland or the UK. This building houses many squash courts, several climbing walls and is home to QUB&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams.

The University Playing Fields, also known as Malone Playing Fields, is located just over from the main campus, comprising 17 pitches for rugby, association football, Gaelic football, hockey, hurling, camogie, and cricket. In addition, there are three netball courts, nine tennis courts, and an athletics arena where the Mary Peters Track is situated. The area and its surrounding forest of Barnetts Demesne are mapped for orienteering.

Queens Gaelic football team compete in the Sigerson Cup and have won the trophy on 8 occasions, with the last victory coming in the 1999/2000 academic year. 

The university&#x27;s association football team, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast A.F.C., play in the Irish Second Division. Queen&#x27;s snooker team have won the British intervarsity title on a record nine occasions and are the current champions.

Queen&#x27;s University Belfast Boat Club is one of the most successful clubs in the university. The QUB boathouse, home of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast Boat Club (QUBBC) and Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast Ladies Boat Club (QUBLBC), is located on the River Lagan near Stranmillis. In 2010 they were reigning Irish Champions in men&#x27;s Intermediate and Senior 8&#x27;s. They are also reigning Irish University Champions in Men&#x27;s Senior 8&#x27;s, Women&#x27;s Novice 8&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Novice 4&#x27;s. They are the only rowing club in Ireland to have a full-time rowing coach.

==Visual identity==
The graphic identity, which includes the logotype, was originally created in 2000 by Lloyd Northover, the British design consultancy founded by John Lloyd and Jim Northover. This identity was updated in 2011 by Belfast-based brand consultancy, Mammoth. Queen&#x27;s visual identity was redesigned again in October 2017, also by Mammoth, replacing the &quot;Q&quot; identity with an updated version of the university&#x27;s crest.

<doc id="322019" wikidata="Q7818173" url="?curid=322019" title="Tom the Dancing Bug">
<text>Tom the Dancing Bug is a weekly satirical comic strip by cartoonist and political commentator Ruben Bolling that covers mostly US current events from a liberal point of view. Tom the Dancing Bug won the 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, and 2009 Association of Alternative Newsweeklies Awards for Best Cartoon. The strip was awarded the 2010 Sigma Delta Chi Award for editorial cartooning by the Society of Professional Journalists and best cartoon in the 2018 Robert F. Kennedy Book &amp; Journalism Awards. His work on the strip won Bolling the 2017 Herblock Prize and the 2021 Berryman Award for Editorial Cartoons, and he was a finalist in the Editorial Cartooning category for the 2019 and 2021 Pulitzer Prize.

== Publication history ==
As Bolling recounted in an interview:

The strip appears in mainstream and alternative weekly newspapers, as well as on the Boing Boing website. At its peak, it was syndicated in print in over 100 newspapers. It ran on Salon.com from 1995 until March 18, 2010.

In 2012, Bolling launched a subscription service, the Inner Hive, which he credits with keeping the comic going amid declines in print newspapers.

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, and especially with the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016, &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot;&#x27;s focus became more overtly political. When accepting the Clifford K. and James T. Berryman Award for Editorial Cartoons on May 4, 2022, Bolling said, &quot;When it started, it was just about apolitical. It was usually about a prehistoric ape-man, or an idiotic time traveler, or something even sillier. The comic strip got more political, more often, as it went along, certainly taking a turn after 9/11. But it was at the rise of Trump in 2016 that I just about handed the comic strip to what I saw as the most important political phenomenon of my lifetime.&quot;

Bolling also explained his approach to satire, pre- and post-Trump, at the same dinner: 

== Recurring characters and segments ==
&quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot; has no real narrative continuity. The title itself is a dadaist non-sequitur, as there is no character called &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot; ever seen or referred to in the strip.

Some individual strips are one-shot &quot;stand-alone&quot; presentations, but certain recurring features within the strip are seen regularly on a rotating basis. One of the most popular recurring segments, &quot;Super-Fun-Pak Comix&quot;, appears roughly once every month or two, and is dealt with in a separate entry, below. Other features currently seen on a fairly frequent basis include:

*God-Man: The Superhero With Omnipotent Powers!: Placed in normal superhero situations, God-Man fights villains like Nietzsche-lad, Dr. Moral Relativism and Blasphemy Boy. God-Man&#x27;s &quot;mundane identity&quot; (when he does not want to attract suspicion) is Milton Baxter. God-Man occasionally solves problems by re-creating the universe and organizing the atoms so that the problem is prevented in the first place. Bolling, speaking in an interview about readers who take offense to the God-Man strips, said &quot;God-Man isn&#x27;t actually God. He is a straw man that I&#x27;m using to make fun of some people&#x27;s very simplistic views about religion and philosophy.&quot; Billy Billings is &quot;God-Man&#x27;s Pal&quot;, a parody of Jimmy Olsen.
*Lucky Ducky: The Poor Little Duck Who&#x27;s Rich In Luck, is a recurring segment purportedly presented by Wall Street Journal Comix. Lucky Ducky first appeared in 2002, after &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorialized against progressive tax policies, calling poor workers &quot;lucky duckies&quot; because they have a smaller federal income tax burden. In his appearances in Bolling&#x27;s strip, Lucky Ducky is an anthropomorphic duck who despite being homeless, destitute, and working in a crummy job always manages to enrage his nemesis, the very wealthy Hollingsworth Hound. Hollingsworth (who usually has a much more prominent role in this segment than the title character) views any source of joy, comfort or financial support in Lucky&#x27;s life to be coming at the expense of the very rich, like himself. As an example, when Lucky is severely injured, and the emergency room accepts him as an indigent patient, Hollingsworth is apoplectic with rage at the &quot;lucky&quot; break the nearly comatose Lucky has received. Typically, the strip will end with an exploited, jailed, and/or near-death and hospitalized Lucky saying &quot;Gotcha!&quot; to an enraged Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth Hound has also occasionally been seen in solo adventures.
*Donald and John: A Boy President and his Imaginary Publicist features six year old president Donald Trump, who is seen conferring with his imaginary publicist John Barron (an imaginary character Trump created and used in real life). The drawing style, lettering, and general tone of the piece is a clear tribute to &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;.
*Q-Nuts casts some of the characters from the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip as QAnon adherents.
*Louis Maltby is an introverted kid with a major guilt complex. He&#x27;s featured in segments &quot;Games Louis Plays&quot;, which describe how Louis looks at the world, and &quot;The Education of Louis&quot;, which show his confusion at the world around him. Louis is used to make social commentary by displaying how school and society treats him, and may be semi-autobiographical. He also sometimes appears in other segments when a kid is needed, and has on at least one occasion appeared in a superhero parody in the guise of his alter-ego, &#x27;The Passive-Aggressor&#x27;.
*News of the Times parodies current events, in a fashion somewhat reminiscent of &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreels.
*Judge Scalia was an extremist version of the U.S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, used to criticize Justice Scalia&#x27;s Supreme Court opinions and overall judicial philosophy.
*Did You Know? points out &quot;Fun Facts&quot; in all sorts of things, poking fun at statistic-and-tidbit-obsessed society. The cult of celebrity is also a frequent target, with subversive trivia such as &quot;Nicole Kidman had to work as a waitress before she became famous, and not a single person asked her for her autograph&quot; and claiming that the Universe has never been nominated for an Oscar.
*Chagrin Falls is a recurring feature about the Smythes, a typical Middle American family.
*Bob is the extremely average male. He sits at home drinking beer and watching scrambled porn on TV on the weekends, and tries to avoid doing chores and other household duties. During the week, he works (or more often daydreams) in the cubicle by the elevator.
*Harvey Richards Esq., Lawyer for Children is about a lawyer who works for children by using the standard children&#x27;s tricks for getting out of things or getting people to do things (&quot;My fingers were crossed!&quot; &quot;I called no crossies!&quot;). The point is that lawyers act an awful lot like young children. The character has been optioned for a feature film by New Line Cinema, to be co-produced by Universal Press Syndicate&#x27;s AMUSE division, but was never realized.
*Brain in a Beaker is a disembodied brain that believes it is in a real body.
*Charley is an australopithecine—a less-developed hominid from the pliocene epoch. He does not have some of the more advanced emotions of humans. He has a taste for grape soft drinks. He appears to be a satire of Curious George.
*Billy Dare, Boy Adventurer parodies the clichés used in boy adventurer stories. Billy is very similar in appearance to Tintin, the famous Belgian comics adventurer.
*Sam Roland, the Detective Who Dies is a Sam Spade-esque noirish private detective, except that &quot;he&quot; always dies.
*James K. Poult, a Mallard Fillmore parody, is an &quot;unbiased media chicken&quot; with multiple conservative media outlets. He was seen briefly as a supporting character in a Hollingsworth Hound story in 2013, but has not had a &quot;starring&quot; role in any strip for several years.
*The Outer Reaches of Plot Twists parodies &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Outer Limits&quot;, showing stories that use multiple plot twists to the point that suspension of disbelief is difficult to achieve.
*Larry Dodson is an &quot;average joe&quot; type character whom the art world has called &quot;the most important artist of the 21st century.&quot;
*Nate the Neoconservative is a neoconservative who refuses to admit his mistakes.
*The Impossible Squad is a military squad of stereotypical &#x27;tough guys&#x27;, all sergeants that list &#x27;explosives&#x27; as their expertise except for one member (whose specialty is usually extremely different from his squadmates). They consider explosives to be the only way to complete any mission. However, the &#x27;different&#x27; member will always suggest another solution based on his skills but his idea is usually shot down by the rest of the team (probably because it doesn&#x27;t involve the direct use of explosives).
*Hollywood Tales are stories that depict Hollywood celebrities, featuring realistic (but static) likeness of their faces, in humorous situations.
*The Ghost of James Caan is a character introduced in a Hollywood Tales story concerning actor Zac Efron. He is supposed to be the disembodied spirit of actor James Caan, despite the fact that Caan is (as of the time of his ghost&#x27;s introduction) still very much alive. This is also true within the comic, causing confusion to the other characters that appear alongside him. The Ghost of James Caan now makes occasional appearances in &quot;Super-Fun-Pak Comix&quot;, below.

=== Super-Fun-Pak Comix ===
A recurring feature, Super Fun-Pak Comix consists of four to six smaller strips, grouped together. These collections of smaller comic strips poke fun at the typical conventions and clichés of modern comic strips. For example, they commonly make fun of stereotypical &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoon settings, such as two people sitting across a desk or a husband and wife at home reading the paper. Individual comics can also be based around peculiar or bizarre concepts, like &#x27;Funny Only to Six-year-olds&#x27; or &#x27;Comic Designed to Fit Vertical Spaces&#x27;. Many Fun-Pak strips are one-offs, but there are also numerous recurring strips, and occasionally, some Fun-Pak space is taken up by a fake ad for unlikely products. As well, some recurring long-form Tom The Dancing Bug comics occasionally make Fun-Pak appearances in a shorter format, and a few recurring Fun-Pak characters (Percival Dunwoody, Dinkle) have made appearances in a long-form strip.

Super-Fun-Pak Comix also appears as a daily strip on gocomix.com.

Currently recurring mini-strips (not always seen in every Fun-Pak) include:

*Percival Dunwoody, Idiot Time Traveller from 1909 is in awe of the modern age, although he is also amazed by things that existed well before 1909, including lightbulbs, dogs and hands. However, he is aware of his own idiocy. Later strips have revealed him to be unfamiliar with the mechanics of time travel and causality (for example, believing that accidentally interfering with someone in the future could prevent his own birth).
*Dinkle, The Unlovable Loser is a parody of such characters as Ziggy or The Born Loser, with the catch being that his status as a loser is completely justified because he is truly un-lovable; he is narcissistic and typically exhibits obnoxious attitudes, such as anti-Semitism, and sociopathic behaviour, ruthlessly exploiting everyone he encounters.
*Marital Mirth is a parody of &quot;The Lockhorns&quot;. The strip concerns a middle-aged married couple in an extremely unhappy relationship, and is supposedly drawn by bitter (fictional) cartoonist Rex Feinstein.
*Doug is an anthropomorphic cartoon creature who is too generically drawn to be any particular type of animal. He is not of high intelligence and has few real talents. The &quot;How to Draw Doug&quot; scripts make fun of Doug&#x27;s rather pathetic life.
*Darthfield reimagines the cartoon character of Garfield the cat as Darth Vader, such as with the ability to use the Force to strangle people.
*Phil Collins is a comic strip about, unsurprisingly, Phil Collins. In recent Fun-Pak strips, he has been teamed with The Ghost of James Caan.
*Science Facts for the Immature presents a scientific fact which is either a double entendre or is followed by a punchline based on bodily humor. Variations of this mini-strip have included Science Facts for the Depressed and Science Facts for the Internet-Addled.
*Various Superhero comics, featuring superheroes with names and traits that parody superheroes in general. Examples include &#x27;Talk-Up-His-Secret-Identity Man&#x27; and &#x27;Garish-Skintight-Lycra-Outfit Man&#x27;.
*Hillbilly Bill, of The Hills is a parody of &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;.
*Classix Comix/Comix Playhouse is an extremely shortened comic form of famous plays and novels. This is apparently a reference to &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot;, a series that provided classic books in shortened comic form.
*Comics for the Elderly (formerly &quot;Hey, Old People! Comics!&quot;) shows old people giving ornery advice to young people and the young people quickly accepting it.
*Uncle Cap&#x27;n is an old lazy pirate who swears and makes you do his work for him through supposed &#x27;puzzles&#x27; and &#x27;fun&#x27; (but usually illegal) activities. He is a parody of Cappy Dick.
*Selfish Gene is about a boy named Gene who only acts in ways that are beneficial to him under the framework of sociobiology. This is a reference to Richard Dawkins&#x27; &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;.
*Chaos Butterfly parodies the butterfly effect. Each strip features a butterfly in Brazil flapping its wings and indirectly causing something unpleasant to happen to a man in Chicago some time later.
*Killjoy was Here features Killjoy, a man who ruins any attempt at a funny dialogue by spouting out depressing facts on global issues such as poverty.
*The Epic/Brutal Report is a two-panel comic based on the good news/bad news gag. The first panel has a teenager relaying the &#x27;good news&#x27; to his friends, who then exclaim &#x27;Epic!&#x27;. In the second panel, he will tell them the &#x27;bad news&#x27;, to which his friends exclaim &#x27;Brutal!&#x27;. The &#x27;bad news&#x27; is always extremely disproportional and/or outlandish relative to the &#x27;good news&#x27;.
*Comics Appropriating and Abusing Intellectual Property Newly Lapsed Into the Public Domain is a vertical strip that has run in the first Super Fun Pak Comix installment of each year since 2019, when works resumed lapsing into the public domain in the United States. Each parodies one of more of the works that entered the public domain of January 1 of that year, initially through fart jokes. 2022&#x27;s installment was instead a complete Billy Dare strip, featuring the Hardy Boys.

Following the September 11 attacks, Bolling used the Super Fun Pak Comix format to acknowledge the events; the punchline to each one of the comics was, &quot;Terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center, killing thousands&quot;.

<doc id="322020" wikidata="Q1968967" url="?curid=322020" title="Leading">
<text>In typography, leading ( ) is the space between adjacent lines of type; the exact definition varies.

In hand typesetting, leading is the thin strips of lead (or aluminium) that were inserted between lines of type in the composing stick to increase the vertical distance between them. The thickness of the strip is called leading and is equal to the difference between the size of the type and the distance from one baseline to the next. For instance, given a type size of 10 points and a distance between baselines of 12 points, the leading would be 2 points.

The term is still used in modern page-layout software such as QuarkXPress, the Affinity Suite, and Adobe InDesign. Consumer-oriented word-processing software often talks of line spacing or, more accurately, interline spacing.

== Origins ==

The word comes from lead strips that were put between set lines of lead type, hence the pronunciation &quot;ledding&quot; and not &quot;leeding&quot;. The practice became popular in the eighteenth century.

== Practices ==

Leading can be used to enhance the legibility of a page or block of text. In &quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot;, Robert Bringhurst recommends more leading for longer measures, and for typefaces with darker weight, larger x-height, a vertical axis, or no serifs. The typographer Matthew Butterick recommends leading between 20% and 45% of the font size.

Double spacing is an entrenched practice due to the era of typewriters and, in academic settings, to allow the addition of handwritten comments and proofreading. Typewriters had a limited number of options for leading, and double spacing was chosen as a default. Double spacing increases the amount of unused white space on a page and reduces the number of lines on a page. Too much leading can cause continuity problems, as the eyes of the reader are required to travel a greater distance between lines of text.

Text set &quot;solid&quot; (no leading) appears cramped, with ascenders almost touching descenders from the previous line. The lack of white space between lines makes it difficult for the eye to track from one line to the next, makes rivers more obvious, and hampers readability.

== Issues ==

Leading can be affected by a series of issues, all of which can be rectified or used to the printer&#x27;s advantage. Negative leading applies only to digital type. An example of negative leading is (12/10) where 2 points are removed from the default leading. A negative leading could be viewed as a hindrance to readability. It would cause the text to be harder to read, as lines would be forced together, lessening room between lines and hindering readability. However, for short bursts of text a negative leading can enhance the message of the text and can create a more effective text. Negative leading can be affected by ascenders and descenders on certain letters. Letters with high ascenders and low descenders can interfere with one another between lines, if the leading is small enough to allow them to touch one another.

Written texts with several portions that demand separate leading can lead to issue of text continuity. Written texts should have a standard leading that does not deviate from page to page. There are instances that call for a change in leading, such as when a block quote is placed within a written text. The lines on the front of a page and the verso (back) should line up vertically, line for line. If there are several leadings contained on one page, this convention can be completely negated. Fonts can also affect the need for leading. No two fonts are exactly alike, and for that reason many have characteristics that demand a certain leading. Fonts that are darker require a wider leading than those that are lighter. As well, fonts that are serif should be leaded wider than those that are sans serif. Languages can decide the leading that a printer uses as well. Leading is an important issue to consider when printing, as it can enhance readability, but it can also affect the number of pages, as larger leadings decrease the number of lines per page. In this way the leading of a page can have a profound effect on the written text.

== Examples ==

This block of text has default leading:
&quot;Typography&quot; (Greek: &quot;typos&quot; &quot;form&quot;, &quot;graphein&quot; &quot;to write&quot;) is the art and technique of setting written subject matter in type using a combination of typeface styles, point sizes, line lengths, line leading, character spacing, and word spacing to produce typeset artwork in physical or digital form.

The same block of text set with 50% leading:
&quot;Typography&quot; (Greek: &quot;typos&quot; &quot;form&quot;, &quot;graphein&quot; &quot;to write&quot;) is the art and technique of setting written subject matter in type using a combination of typeface styles, point sizes, line lengths, line leading, character spacing, and word spacing to produce typeset artwork in physical or digital form.

The same block of text at 100% leading:
&quot;Typography&quot; (Greek: &quot;typos&quot; &quot;form&quot;, &quot;graphein&quot; &quot;to write&quot;) is the art and technique of setting written subject matter in type using a combination of typeface styles, point sizes, line lengths, line leading, character spacing, and word spacing to produce typeset artwork in physical or digital form.

== On the World Wide Web ==
In CSS, leading refers to the difference between the content height and the value of the codice_1 property. Half the leading is called the half-leading. User agents center glyphs vertically in an inline box, which adds half-leading on the top and bottom. For example, if a piece of text is &quot;12pt&quot; high and the line-height value is &quot;14pt&quot;, 2pt of extra space should be added: 1pt above and 1pt below the text (this applies to empty boxes as well, as if the empty box contained zero-height text).

== Feathering ==
The leading may be increased to align the bottom line of text on a page in a process known as feathering, carding, or vertical justification.

== Bastard fonts ==

In metal typesetting some fonts have default increased or decreased leading. To achieve this, a smaller font face is cast on the body of a larger font or vice versa. Such fonts are usually called &quot;bastard&quot; fonts or types. The usual way of indicating such a font is to write the face size first, then a slash and the body size: 10/12 means a 10-point face on a 12-point body, and 12/10 means a 12-point face on a 10-point body.

<doc id="322024" wikidata="Q7375943" url="?curid=322024" title="Ruben Bolling">
<text>Ruben Bolling (born c. 1963 in New Jersey) is a pseudonym for Ken Fisher, an American cartoonist, the author of &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot;. His work started out apolitical, instead featuring absurdist humor, parodying comic strip conventions, or critiquing celebrity culture. He came to increasingly satirize conservative politics after the September 11 attacks and Iraq war in the early 2000s. This trend strengthened with the Donald Trump presidency and right-wing populism from 2017-2020, his critiques of which earned him several cartooning awards.

==Career ==
Fisher, who has no formal art training, read many comics when he was a child (his biggest influence being Garry Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;Doonesbury&quot;), and sometimes features their styles in his work. However, he didn&#x27;t aspire to be a full-time cartoonist; instead he studied economics as an undergraduate at Tufts University and later attended Harvard Law School (graduating in 1987). It was at Harvard in the mid-1980s that Fisher came up with the idea for &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot; and his pseudonym, Ruben Bolling (which is a melding of the names of two favorite old-time baseball players, Ruben Amaro and Frank Bolling). Tom the Dancing Bug originally ran in the &quot;Harvard Law School Record&quot;.

After graduation, Fisher practiced law for several years before resigning to pursue comics full-time. When that didn&#x27;t work out, comic writing became a side interest and Fisher became a full-time employee at a financial services company. &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot; was picked up for weekly syndication in 1997 by Universal Press Syndicate.

Fisher was working on building a full-time comics career, driven in part by a project, thus far never realized, with New Line Cinema to produce a movie about his character Harvey Richards, Esq., a &quot;Lawyer for Children.&quot;

Newspapers that have published &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot; include &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. At its peak, &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot; was syndicated in print in over 100 newspapers, but is now published almost entirely online. In 2012, Fisher launched a subscription service, the Inner Hive, which he credits with keeping the comic going amid declines in print newspapers.

A &quot;Super Fun-Pak Comix&quot; installment from 2014, entitled &quot;The Comic Strip That Has A Finale Every Day&quot;, parodied farewell installments from long-running comic strips. This then became an ongoing feature on the gocomics.com site under the pseudonym John &quot;Scully&quot; Scully, releasing the same comic every day.

In 2015, Fisher published the first in a series of children&#x27;s books, &quot;The EMU Club Adventures&quot;.

== Awards ==

Fisher is a five-time winner of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies Award for Best Cartoon, for 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, and 2009. In 2010, he received the Society of Professional Journalists award for Editorial Cartooning for a non-daily publication.

Fisher won numerous awards for his satirical criticism of the Donald Trump presidency. He was the winner of the 2017 Herblock Prize for editorial cartooning based on a selection of 15 Trump-themed &quot;Tom the Dancing Bug&quot; cartoons. In 2017, he won a 2017 Silver Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society for &quot;Donald and John,&quot; a series in the style of Calvin and Hobbes that cast Donald Trump as a childish Calvin-like figure and Trump alter-ego John Barron as Trump&#x27;s &quot;imaginary publicist&quot; in place of Hobbes.

He was awarded a prize for best cartoon in the 2018 Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award and in 2019 and 2021 he was a finalist in the Editorial Cartooning category for the Pulitzer Prize. His &quot;mordant wit, superior artwork and inventive delivery&quot; won him the 2021 Berryman Award for Editorial Cartoons from the National Press Foundation.

Bolling won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Reuben Award for Editorial Cartoons in 2022 and was nominated again in 2023.

== Personal life ==
Fisher is married to a lawyer; they have three children.

<text>Not a Pretty Girl is the sixth studio album released by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco on her own record label, Righteous Babe Records. It was released July 18, 1995. The album extended the folk singer&#x27;s early formula of acoustic guitar and drums. On subsequent records, DiFranco would add electric guitar, horns, band members and guest musicians, but on &quot;Not a Pretty Girl&quot; she was accompanied by Andy Stochansky&#x27;s percussion alone.

According to AllMusic, &quot;Light of Some Kind&quot; is a &quot;deeply felt portrait...in which the singer seems to be confessing to a man that she has been unfaithful to him with a woman&quot;. Released on &quot;Living in Clip&quot;, the track &quot;Shy&quot; earned DiFranco a 1997 Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.

&quot;Shy&quot; off the album is notable for being quoted by Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio during live performances of the song &quot;Ninety-Seven&quot;.

<text>Acta Sanctorum (&quot;Acts of the Saints&quot;) is an encyclopedic text in 68 folio volumes of documents examining the lives of Christian saints, in essence a critical hagiography, organised by the saints&#x27; feast days. The project was conceived and begun by the Jesuit Heribert Rosweyde. After his death in 1629, the Jesuit scholar Jean Bolland (&#x27;Bollandus&#x27;, 1596–1665) continued the work, which was gradually finished over the centuries by the Bollandists, who continue to edit and publish the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;.

The Bollandists oversaw the project, first in Antwerp and then in Brussels. The &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; began with two January volumes (for saints whose feast days were in January), published in 1643. From 1643 to 1794, 53 folio volumes of &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; were published, covering the saints from 1 January to 14 October. When the Jesuits were suppressed by the Habsburg governor of the Low Countries in 1788, the work continued at Tongerlo Abbey. After the creation of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Bollandists were permitted to reassemble, working from the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels. The main work ended with the &quot;Propylaeum&quot; to December published in 1940. 

In addition to the extraordinary amount of biographical material, extensively researched, the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; broke new ground in its use of historical criticism.

<text>Vlorë ( , ; ) is the third most populous city of Albania and seat of Vlorë County and Vlorë Municipality. Located in southwestern Albania, Vlorë sprawls on the Bay of Vlorë and is surrounded by the foothills of the Ceraunian Mountains along the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea Coasts. It experiences a Mediterranean climate, which is affected by the Ceraunian Mountains and the proximity to the Mediterranean Sea.

The coastal area of Vlorë was one of those Illyrian sites that had experienced pre-urban activity beginning from the 11th–10th centuries BCE. The area was colonized by Ancient Greeks. A large fortified port-town that was inhabited from the 6th century BCE to the 2nd century AD is placed, now partially submerged, in Triport, northwest of present-day Vlorë. Substantial port activity in this site occurred from at least the archaic period to the medieval period. It has been suggested that a transfer of the ancient city from the site of Triport to the site of modern Vlorë occurred. The center of the modern city features archaeological remains dating from late antiquity. &quot;Aulon&quot;, from which the modern city took its name, appears in historical sources starting form the 2nd century CE. It was conquered at different periods throughout history by Romans, Byzantines, Normans, Venetians and Ottomans.

Between the 18th and 19th centuries, the Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength for national consciousness, which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance. Vlorë played an instrumental role in Albanian Independence as an epicenter for the founders of modern Albania, who signed the Declaration of Independence on 28 November 1912 at the Assembly of Vlorë.

Vlorë is one of the most significant cities of southern Albania and the region of Labëria which is traditionally noted for its culture, traditions and folklore. Vlorë is served by the Port of Vlorë, the SH8 highway, and the A2 motorway, collectively representing part of the Adriatic–Ionian Corridor and the Pan-European Corridor VIII.

== Name ==

The city took its name from , meaning &quot;channel, glen&quot; that resembles an aulos instrument. It is a typical toponym in the Greek world. The name of the city was first recorded in the 2nd century AD, by two Ancient Greek authors, Lucian and Ptolemy, the latter calling it &quot;town and sea-port&quot;, which confirms that it was founded much earlier. However, Aulon has not been mentioned by earlier Ancient Greek and Roman authors, who on the other hand recorded the nearby town and seaport of Oricum. But in later sources Oricum is less encountered, while the toponym Aulon is more frequently mentioned.

&quot;Vlorë&quot; developed from the ancient &quot;Aulon-a&quot; through the evolution of the phonetic system of the Albanian language with the rhotacism &quot;Vlonë&quot; &gt; &quot;Vlorë&quot;, which is a pre-Slavic phenomenon in Albanian. The intervocalic has regularly evolved to in Tosk Albanian, while the initial has evolved from unstressed after the disappearance of the initial unstressed . The evolution &gt; should be relatively ancient, preventing the evolution of the following intervocalic to . In Geg Albanian the toponym is pronounced &quot;Vlonë&quot;, indicating that it has been in use among northern Albanians before the appearance of rhotacism in Tosk Albanian. Also the accent pattern of the name observes Albanian accent rules. The name itself of the inhabitants (sing. &quot;vlonjat&quot;, pl. &quot;vlonjatë&quot;) has not undergone the rhotacism affecting the toponym (if it had, it would look something like &quot;vlorat&quot; or &quot;vlorjat&quot;).

The medieval and modern Greek name is &quot;Avlónas&quot; ( &quot;Aulṓnas&quot; , accusative &quot;Aulṓna&quot; ), and is the source of the Latin &quot;Aulona&quot;, the Italian &quot;Valona&quot; (also used in other languages) and of the obsolete English &quot;Avlona&quot;. During the Ottoman era the city of Vlorë was known in Turkish as &quot;Avlonya&quot;. In Medieval Latin sources and in Old Italian records it is mentioned with the forms &quot;Avalona&quot;, &quot;Avelona&quot;, &quot;Lavalona&quot;, &quot;Lavellona&quot;; and in Old Serbian sources as &quot;Avlona&quot; or &quot;Vavlona&quot;, the latter containing the Slavic preposition &quot;v&quot; &quot;in&quot;. In Aromanian, the city is known as .

== History ==

=== Early history ===












The coastal area of Vlorë was one of those Illyrian sites that had experienced pre-urban activity beginning from the 11th–10th centuries BCE. During the period of Euboean colonization of the area (early 8th century BC) the bay of Vlorë was associated with several Heroic traditions and the foundation of several settlements there, as the toponym Aulon suggest which is also known in local Eubean toponimity.

Due to its strategic position on the Adriatic Sea, especially the Bay of Vlorë, which forms a natural harbor, Vlorë occupied a significant place in classical antiquity as a base for trade by many peoples. Vlorë is considered one of the oldest cities in Albania and the region. In the Archaic era, the area was colonized by Ancient Greeks, who are traditionally believed to have founded Orikos, Thronion and Aulon on these shores. A large fortified port-town that was inhabited from the 6th century BCE to the 2nd century AD is placed, now partially submerged, in Triport, northwest of present-day Vlorë. It was delimited by three walls, the first of which dating back to the late 6th century BCE. The port activity in this site lasted from at least the archaic period to the medieval period. It has been suggested that a transfer of the ancient city from the site of Triport to the site of modern Vlorë occurred. The center of the modern city features walls dating from the 4th to the 10th centuries CE, as well as a wall, a quadrangular tower and ruins of a huse with ceramics dating back to the 3rd–4th centuries and to the 6th-7th centuries CE.

The archaeological site of Triport has been identified with ancient &quot;Thronion&quot; or &quot;Aulon&quot;. &quot;Thronion&quot; was attested by Pausanias (2nd century CE) as a Locrian–Euboean colony, but also by a dedication on a monument erected in Olympia, both accounts reporting that Apollonia conquered the city around 450 BCE. &quot;Aulon&quot;, from which Vlorë took its name, was mentioned for the first time by Ptolemy (2nd century CE) among the towns of the Illyrian Taulantii. Carl Patsch proposed the first location of &quot;Aulon&quot; in Triport being then transferred to the current location of Vlora, and Pierre Cabanes proposed the location of &quot;Thronion&quot; in Triport; those identifications are not in contradiction with each other. Other geographical documents, such as the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot; and Hierocles&#x27; &quot;Synecdemus&quot;, also mention Aulon. The city served as an important port of the Roman Empire, when it was part of Epirus Nova.

Aulon (&quot;Avlona&quot;) became an episcopal see in the 5th century. Among the known bishops are &quot;Nazarius&quot; in 458 and &quot;Soter&quot; in 553 (Daniele Farlati, &quot;Illyricum sacrum&quot;, VII, 397–401). The diocese at that time belonged to the papal Pentarchy. In 733, it was annexed with the eastern Illyricum, to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and yet it is not mentioned in any &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; of that Church. The bishopric had probably been suppressed for though the Bulgarians had been in possession of this country for some time, Avlona is not mentioned in the &quot;Notitiae episcopatuum&quot; of the Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid.

During the Roman period, a Latin see was established and Eubel (&quot;Hierarchia catholica medii aevi&quot;, I, 124) mentions several of its bishops. 

Aulon, no longer being a residential bishopric, is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see, a suffragan bishop of Durrës, being distinguished from a Greek titular see called Aulon by the use for it of the adjective &quot;Aulonitanus&quot;, while the adjective regarding the Aulon in Euboea (Ionian Greece) is &quot;Aulonensis&quot;. The diocese was nominally restored as Latin titular bishopric Aulon, or Valona in Curiate Italian; from 1925 it was (als) named Aulona in Latin and/or Italian, since 1933 it&#x27;s only Aulon in Latin, Aulona in Italian. It was a bishopric from the fifth century until Bulgarian rule.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the 11th and 12th century, Vlorë played an instrumental role in the conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and Norman Kingdom of Sicily. Following Norman occupation, they ruled for only four years and established a Latin church episcopal see in Vlorë. In 1321 the city being under Byzantine control was attacked by a Venetian fleet under Giovanni Michiel as a result costing the lives of many of its Greek inhabitants. Vlorë served as capital of the Principality of Valona, initially a vassal state to the Serbian empire, and later, independent Christian state from 1346 to 1417.

The Ottoman Empire captured the city in 1417, while in 1432, Albanian rebels freed Vlorë and expelled the Ottomans from the area. As part of the Ottoman Empire, Vlorë became a &quot;sanjak&quot; centre in Rumelia Eyalet under the name &quot;Avlonya&quot;. Later it become a Venetian possession in 1690 and the city was restored to the Ottomans in 1691, becoming a kaza of the Sanjak of Avlona in the &quot;vilayet&quot; (province) of Janina. At the time the city had about 10,000 inhabitants; there was a Catholic parish, which belonged to the Archdiocese of Durrës. During the early period of Ottoman rule, Vlorë became an international port centered on a high volume of trade between western Europe and the Ottoman state.

In 1426, the Ottomans supported the settlement of a Jewish community involved in mercantile activities. The community underwent population growth in subsequent decades with Jews migrating from Corfu, Venetian ruled lands, Naples, France, and the Iberian Peninsula. Around seventy Jewish families from Valencia, including former &quot;conversos&quot;, settled in Vlorë between 1391 and 1492. Following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, the Ottoman state resettled additional Jewish exiles in Vlorë toward the end of the fifteenth century. Ottoman censuses for 1506 and 1520 recorded the Jewish population as consisting of 528 families and some 2,600 people in Vlorë. The Jews of Vlorë were involved in trade and the city imported items from Europe and exported spices, leather, cotton fabrics, velvets, brocades, and mohair from the Ottoman cities of Istanbul and Bursa. The Vlorë Jewish community took an active role in the welfare of other Jews such as managing to attain the release of war related captives present in Durrës in 1596. After the Battle of Lepanto (1571) and the deterioration of security along the Ottoman controlled Adriatic and Ionian coasts, the numbers of Jews within Vlorë decreased.

=== Albanian Renaissance ===

Between the 18th and 19th centuries, cultural developments, widely attributed to Albanians having gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength, conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance with Vlorë becoming an epicenter of the movement in 1912. In 1833, Vlorë was captured by Albanian rebels forcing the Ottoman government to abolish taxes and comply to rebel requests.
In 1851 it suffered severely from an earthquake. The Jewish community of Yanina renewed the Jewish community of Vlorë in the nineteenth century.

On November 28, 1912, Ismail Qemali head the Albanian Declaration of Independence in Vlorë, during the First Balkan War. The city became Albania&#x27;s first capital following its independence. The 1914 Vlorë Raid took place that January, and was a short-lived plot to regain Albania under Ottoman control. The city was invaded by Italy in 1914 during World War I. The city remained occupied by Italian forces until an Albanian rebellion forced the Italians out of Albania in 1920. Italy invaded Vlorë again in 1939. The city remained under Italian occupation until Italy surrendered to the allies in 1943. Subsequently, Nazi Germany occupied the city until 1944. The city was liberated in 1944 by communist forces under Enver Hoxha.

=== Communist Albania ===

During the World War II, Sazan Island became the site of a German and Italian submarine base and naval installations; these installations were heavily bombed by the Allies.

After World War II, with Albania ruled by a Communist Party, the port was leased out to the Soviet Union for use as a submarine base. During 1960 and 1961 it served as a theater in the aftermath of the decision of Enver Hoxha to denounce Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s reforms. In April 1961 the Soviet Union, resenting being pushed out after considerable investment in the naval facilities at nearby Pasha Liman Base, threatened to occupy Vlora with Soviet troops, and cut off all Soviet economic, military and technical aid to Albania. The threat was not carried out, as a result of the simultaneous international developments; most notably the Cuban Missile Crisis. Hoxha, realizing the vulnerability of Albania after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, ordered the construction of hundreds of thousands of concrete bunkers. Under Hoxha, Vlorë served as an important recruiting centre for the Sigurimi; the Albanian state security, intelligence and secret police service.

In 1997, Vlorë was the center of the 1997 Albanian civil unrest after the collapse of several fraudulent investment schemes that led to the downfall of the Sali Berisha administration.

Vlorë lies on the north–south transportation corridor of Albania and is served by a network of motorways and highways connecting the city to other parts of Albania. The preceding SH8 highway, beginning from Fier, links the northern districts of Vlorë with the central and southern districts, continuing along the Albanian Riviera to Sarandë. The A2 motorway parallelly runs along the SH8 from Fier to Vlorë and terminates after entering the city in the north. Upon completion, the bypass of Vlorë will link the A2 motorway through the suburbs of Vlorë with the SH8 highway.

Vlorë is served by the Port of Vlorë, the second busiest port in Albania, located in the northern part of the city&#x27;s coast.

The Vlorë railway station is the southern terminus of the Durrës-Vlorë railway line which connects Vlorë with Durrës and the rest of the Albanian rail network. It opened in 1985 when the railway line was extended from Fier to Vlorë. A very limited service remained in operation until 2015, but currently passenger services no longer run south of Fier. However, a private railway company, Albrail, started operation of freight trains from Fier to Vlorë in 2018.

The Vlorë International Airport is a proposed airport development project currently under construction as part of Albania&#x27;s plan to increase transportation links to destinations in southern Albania. The proposed location for the airport lies at the village of Akërni within the Vjosa-Narta Protected Landscape in the north of Vlorë, which was met with widespread criticism. The construction was officially launched on 28 November 2021, and has a completion target date of April 2024. The airport also has plans to include a marina and an agritourism site.

<doc id="322055" wikidata="Q2094217" url="?curid=322055" title="USS Constellation (1797)">
<text>USS &quot;Constellation&quot; was a nominally rated 38-gun wooden-hulled, three-masted frigate of the United States Navy.

The ship was built under the direction of David Stodder at The Joseph and Samuel Sterett shipyard on Harris Creek in Baltimore&#x27;s Fell&#x27;s Point maritime community, and was launched on 7 September 1797. &quot;Constellation&quot; was one of the original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized.

The name &quot;Constellation&quot; was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed. The Flag Act of 1777 speaks of how the stars in the flag are &quot;representing a new constellation&quot;.

Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy&#x27;s capital ships, and so &quot;Constellation&quot; and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. The Constellation&#x27;s first duties with the newly formed U.S. Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War.

==Design and construction==


American merchant vessels began to fall prey to Barbary Pirates, along the so-called &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; of North Africa, Morocco, Tunis (in future Tunisia), Tripoli (in future Libya), and most notably from Algiers (in future Algeria), in the Mediterranean Sea during the 1790s. Congress responded with the Naval Act of 1794. The Act provided funds for the construction of six frigates to be built in six different East Coast ports; however, it included a clause stating that construction of the ships would cease if the United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers. By the time of the conclusion in 1815, of the later War of 1812 with Great Britain, the United States had fought a series of three brief, but savage naval and amphibious wars.

Joshua Humphreys&#x27; design was deep, long of keel, affording high speed downwind and efficiency when close-hauled. The design was to extremely heavy scantlings, including the planking, and incorporated Humphreys&#x27; innovative diagonal rib to limit hogging. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States could not match for size the navies of the European states. He therefore designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a &quot;ship of the line&quot; (equivalent to a modern-day &quot;battleship&quot;). However, Constellation was a scaled-down version of his more famous designs for Constitution, United States and President, being closer in size to the standard European frigates of the day, and mounting the usual armament of 18-pounder guns.

&quot;Constellation&quot; was built under the direction of Colonel David Stodder at his naval shipyard on Harris Creek in Baltimore&#x27;s Fell&#x27;s Point maritime community, according to a design by Joshua Humphreys. She was launched on 7 September 1797, just as the United States entered the Quasi-War with the revolutionary French Republic. Harris Creek which flows into the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River was later filled in to gain additional land for residential/industrial development and diverted underground to a subterranean storm drain and culvert in the early 19th century. It was situated east of Fell&#x27;s Point and south of where modern-day Patterson Park, (near Highlandtown), and the community of Canton are currently located.

An earlier visitor to the Harris Creek naval shipyard of David Stodder, east of Baltimore Town in 1796, the Duke de la Rochefoucaule-Liancourt, saw &quot;Constellation&quot; under construction and noted in his journal: &quot;I thought her too much encumbered with wood-work within, but in other respects she is a fine vessel being built of those beautiful kinds of wood, the ever-green oak and cedar; she is pierced for 36 guns.&quot;

===Armament===
The Naval Act of 1794 had specified 36-gun frigates; however, &quot;Constellation&quot; and her sister-ship were re-rated to 38&#x27;s because of their large dimensions, being in length and in width.

The &quot;ratings&quot; by number of guns were meant only as an approximation, as &quot;Constellation&quot; could and often did carry up to 48 guns. U.S. Navy ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns such as modern Navy ships carry. The guns were designed to be completely portable and often were exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer outfitted armaments to his liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, the armaments on ships changed often during their careers, and records of the changes were not generally kept.

==Quasi-War==

The Quasi-War between France and the States came about when after the French Revolution, the United States refused to repay remaining debt to France on the grounds that it had been owed to the previous regime. French outrage led to a series of attacks on American shipping by privateers. &quot;Constellation&quot; convoyed American merchantmen from June through August 1798 before sailing under the command of Captain Thomas Truxtun for the West Indies in December 1798 to protect the United States&#x27;s commerce in the Caribbean.

On 2 February, 1799 she exchanged fire with a French fort at Saint-Pierre, Martinique.

===&quot;Constellation&quot; vs. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;===
On 9 February 1799, under the command of Truxtun, &quot;Constellation&quot; fought and captured the frigate &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; of 36 guns, the fastest ship in the French Navy. The battle started about NE of the island of Nevis about midday when &quot;Constellation&quot; spotted &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;, which hoisted studding sails and attempted to run. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; had recently captured , a schooner, in November 1798 and three weeks previously had been chased by &quot;Constitution&quot; and had escaped. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;″s job was that of commerce raiding, wanting nothing to do with another warship, and tried to flee &quot;Constellation&quot;. Within an hour of hauling in chase Truxtun was close enough to make private signals to identify if the ship he was pursuing was British or not. With no answer, he proceeded to chase &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; down, clearing for action and beating to quarters. Truxtun made private signals for the U.S. Navy and again received no answer. &quot;Constellation&quot; crowded on all sail despite a rising squall that threatened to tear a sail or throw a spar.

Reefing sail just long enough to weather the short squall, &quot;Constellation&quot; hardly paused but the same was not to be for &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;: the ship&#x27;s topmast snapped and slowed the ship to the onrushing &quot;Constellation&quot;. Captain Barreaut ordered &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; to lay up and prepared to fight. &quot;Constellation&quot; was outfitted with 24 pounder guns that caused her to lean too much to lee due to topweight and thus had to surrender the weather gage to &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;. (The ship was refitted with 18-pounder long guns in the next refit.) &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; raised the French Tricolor and Captain Barreaut asked for parley. Captain Truxtun refused to answer, as his orders were to attack any French warship or privateer, and answered when his last gun could be brought to bear. American warships of this period fired for the hull (as did the British) and each of the 24-pounders had been double shotted. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; fired as per training at &quot;Constellation&quot;″s masts and rigging. &quot;Constellation&quot;″s masts were saved when the sail was reduced, taking pressure off the damaged mast. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; was devastated by &quot;Constellation&quot;″s first broadside with many dead and others deserting their guns. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; tried to board and slowed to close but this allowed &quot;Constellation&quot; to shoot ahead and crossed bows for a bow rake with another broadside. &quot;Constellation&quot; crossed to windward and &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot; turned to follow with both crews now exchanging port broadsides instead of starboard. One of &quot;Constellation&quot;″s 24-pounders smashed through the hull of &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&#x27;s&quot; 12-pounders were not equal to the same task against &quot;Constellation&quot;″s hull. Captain Barreaut had been shown one of &quot;Constellation&quot;″s 24 pound cannonballs and understood that he was in a completely unequal contest with sails down and nothing comparable to reply with many already dead and wounded. He struck colors— the first major victory by an American-designed and built warship.

On 14 March, 1799 she captured the French Letter of Marque schooner &quot;Union&quot; off Basse-Terre Roads, Guadeloupe.

On 15 April recaptured British merchant &quot;Brothers&quot;, captured by a French privateer on 14 April. 

On 17 April, 1799 she and captured French letter of marque schooner &quot;Diligente&quot; off Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe.

She arrived at Hampton Roads 19 May, 1799.
She sailed from Chesapeake Bay 30 June, 1799.

After returning from that cruise arriving at Newcastle Delaware on or about 11 October she discharged her crew and began repairs. She departed Hampton Roads on 24 December escorting a stores ship and several merchantmen passing Cape Henry the next day.

===&quot;Constellation&quot; vs. &quot;La Vengeance&quot;===
&quot;Constellation&quot; sailed under Captain Thomas Truxtun from Saint Kitts on 30 January 1800, and encountered the French frigate &quot;La Vengeance&quot;, of &quot;La Résistance&quot; class (design by Pierre Degay, with 30 × 24-pounder guns and 20 × 12-pounder guns) during the night on 1 February 1800. &quot;La Vengeance&quot; was outweighed by &quot;Constellation&quot; but had the heavier broadside, to . &quot;La Vengeance&quot; attempted to run and had to be chased down. An hour after sunset &quot;Constellation&quot; came into hailing range and when &quot;La Vengeance&quot; was ordered to stand to and surrender, the ship answered with a broadside at (). After an hour &quot;Constellation&quot;″s foresails failed and had to be repaired; she then overtook &quot;La Vengeance&quot; and a running battle exchanging broadsides continued. Twice the ships came close enough that boarders were called for on both ships, the second occasion was quite bloody as U.S. Marines in &quot;Constellation&quot; shot up the deck of &quot;La Vengeance&quot; leaving the deck covered in bodies of the dead and wounded, and forcing the boarding party to seek cover. A young lieutenant standing next to Captain Pitot of &quot;La Vengeance&quot; had his arm taken off at this time. By late in the evening, &quot;Constellation&quot; was victorious after a five-hour battle. &quot;La Vengeance&quot; was so holed in the hull and the rigging so cut up that the ship grounded outside the port of Curaçao rather than attempt to sail into port for fear of sinking. The French commander just managed to save his ship from capture by taking advantage of the darkness and – upon returning to port – was so humiliated he later boasted that the American ship he had fought was a much larger and more powerful ship of the line. Despite a heavier broadside Captain Pitot of &quot;La Vengeance&quot; accounted that they had fired 742 rounds in the engagement while Captain Truxtun of &quot;Constellation&quot; reported 1,229 rounds expended. &quot;Constellation&quot; also suffered major damage. She had 13 crew killed, 25 wounded and 1 missing. Her rigging and spars were so damaged that the crew dared not try to sail upwind and so went to Port Royal, Jamaica, arriving on 8 February. She was joined on 5 February by (). Unable to complete a refit she departed Jamaica on 1 March and limped home on a jury rig system while escorting a convoy. After the encounter, &quot;Constellation&quot;″s speed and power inspired the French to nickname her the &quot;Yankee Racehorse.&quot; She arrived at Hampton Roads 25 March. By 3 May, 1800 Thomas Truxton had been replaced as Captain by Capt. Alexander Murray. She departed Hampton Roads and was off Cape Henry on 20 May, 1800. She arrived at St. Kitts about 23 June. On 26 June she recaptured ship &quot;Minerva&quot; that had been captured by a privateer on 25 June. On 2 July she recaptured Danish schooner &quot;Charming Betsy&quot; that had been captured by a French privateer stating that the Danish captain, still on board, had requested recapture. She arrived at Newcastle, Delaware 10 October, 1800. By 24 December she was anchored off Sandy Hook. She sailed from New York on 9 January, 1801. Sometime in January, 1801, possibly 17 or 18 January, in the night she exchanged fire with HMS Magnanime until identities were established, with the few shots fired doing no material damage being done to either. On 18 January she stopped the French privateer lugger &quot;Marrs&quot; and found that a Treaty had been signed. Later in the day she recaptured brig &quot;Prude&quot;, releasing the prize crew to &quot;Marrs&quot;.

At the end of the Quasi-War with France, &quot;Constellation&quot; returned to the United States. While anchoring in Delaware Bay on 10 April 1801, she was caught in winds and an ebb tide that ran her aground on a sand bar and laid her over on her beam ends. She was still aground as of 26 April, but refloated by 3 May. She suffered damage requiring extensive repairs at Philadelphia.

==First Barbary War==
During the United States&#x27; preoccupation with France during the Quasi-War, troubles with the Barbary States were suppressed by the payment of tribute to ensure that American merchant ships were not harassed and seized. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute he was receiving in comparison to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000. In response, Thomas Jefferson sent a squadron of frigates to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and pursue peace with the Barbary States.

The first squadron, under the command of Richard Dale in , was instructed to escort merchant ships through the Mediterranean and negotiate with leaders of the Barbary States.

She left Philadelphia, arriving at Chester on 26 February 1802 to receive her guns, ect. after getting over the bar. She departed New Castle, Delaware on 13 March.
Sailing with the squadron of Commodore Richard Morris, and later, with that of Commodores Samuel Barron and John Rodgers, &quot;Constellation&quot; served in the blockade of Tripoli in May 1802. On 22 July 1802 she exchanged fire with Tripolitan gunboats and troops, reportedly sinking 2 gunboats and killing a general. She received orders to return home on 12 December 1802. She arrived in Chesapeake Bay on 11 March, 1803. She was reactivated following the loss of USS Philadelphia, with Capt. Hugh Campbell in command. She left Eastern Branch on 11 June and arrived at Hampton Roads on 21 June. She cruised widely throughout the Mediterranean in 1804 to show the flag; evacuated in June 1805 a contingent of United States Marines, as well as diplomatic personages, from Derne at the conclusion of a fleet-shore operation against Tripoli; and took part in a squadron movement against Tunis that culminated in peace terms in August 1805. &quot;Constellation&quot; returned to the United States in November 1805, mooring at Washington, D.C., where she later was placed in ordinary until 1812.

==War of 1812==
&quot;Constellation&quot; underwent repairs at Washington, D.C., in 1812–1813, and with the advent of the War of 1812 with the United Kingdom, commanded by Captain Charles Stewart, was dispatched to Hampton Roads, Virginia. In January 1813, shortly after arrival, the ship was effectively blockaded by a British squadron of line-of-battle ships and frigates. She up toward Norfolk, and when the tide rose ran in and anchored between the forts; and a few days later dropped down to cover the forts which were being built at Craney Island. Here the ship was exposed to attacks from the British force still lying in Hampton Roads, and, fearing they would attempt to carry her by surprise, Captain Stewart made preparation for defense. The crew anchored in the middle of the narrow channel, flanked by gun-boats, lower ports closed, not a rope left hanging over the sides; the boarding nettings, boiled in half-made pitch till they were as hard as wire, were outboard toward the yardarms, and loaded with kentledge to fall on the attacking boats when the tricing lines were cut, while the carronades were loaded to the muzzle with musket balls, and depressed so as to sweep the water near the ship. Twice, a force of British, estimated by their foes to number 2,000 men, started off at night to take &quot;Constellation&quot; by surprise but on each occasion they were discovered and closely watched by guard-boats, and they never ventured to make the attack.

==Second Barbary War==
Soon after the United States declared war against Britain in 1812, Algiers took advantage of the United States&#x27; preoccupation with Britain and began intercepting American merchant ships in the Mediterranean. On 2 March 1815, at the request of President James Madison, Congress declared war on Algiers. Work preparing two American squadrons promptly began—one at Boston under Commodore William Bainbridge, and one at New York under Commodore Steven Decatur.

&quot;Constellation&quot;, attached to the Mediterranean Squadron under Commodore Stephen Decatur, sailed from New York on 20 May 1815 and joined in the capture of the Algerian frigate &quot;Mashuda&quot; on 17 June 1815. Treaties of peace were soon reached with Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. &quot;Constellation&quot; remained with the squadron under Commodores William Bainbridge, Isaac Chauncey, and John Shaw to enforce the accords, returning to Hampton Roads only in December 1817.

==Later career==

In the spring of 1819 Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson selected Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry for the mission of establishing friendly relations with the government of newly independent Venezuela and negotiating to obtain restitution for United States schooners &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot; that the Venezuelans had illegally taken during the revolution. In 1819, by order of President James Monroe &quot;Constellation&quot; sailed for the Orinoco River, Venezuela, along with the frigate and the schooner . Arriving on 15 July, Commodore Perry shifted his flag to &quot;Nonsuch&quot; and sailed upriver to Angostura to negotiate an anti-piracy agreement. A favorable treaty was signed on 11 August with Vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea, but when the little fleet started downriver, many of the crew including Perry had been stricken with yellow fever.

Despite the efforts to reach Trinidad for medical assistance, the commodore died on his 34th birthday on board &quot;John Adams&quot; shortly after her arrival at Gulf of Paria on 23 August. He was buried in Port of Spain with great honors while &quot;Nonsuch&quot;″s crew acted as honor guard.

From 12 November 1819 to 24 April 1820, &quot;Constellation&quot; served as flagship of Commodore Charles Morris on the Brazil Station, protecting American commerce against privateers and supporting the negotiation of trade agreements with South American nations. On 25 July 1820, she sailed for the first time to Pacific waters and arrived in Valparaíso, Chile under Charles G. Ridgeley on January 14, 1821. He was then relieved by Commodore Charles Stewart in April 1822. &quot;Constellation&quot; remained thus employed for two years, protecting American shipping off the coast of Peru, an area where disquiet erupted into revolt against Spain.

In 1825, &quot;Constellation&quot; was chosen as flagship for Commodore Lewis Warrington and began duty with the West India Squadron to eradicate waning piracy operations in the Caribbean. During an outbreak of yellow fever at Key West, Florida, Warrington moved the squadron&#x27;s home port to Pensacola, Florida where a permanent base was established. Other ships operating with &quot;Constellation&quot; during this period in the West Indies were , , , , , and . Warrington returned to the United States with &quot;Constellation&quot; in 1826.

In August 1829, &quot;Constellation&quot; cruised to the Mediterranean to watch over American shipping and to collect indemnities from previous losses suffered by U.S. merchantmen. While en route to station, the ship carried the American ministers to France and the United Kingdom to their posts of duty. Returning to the United States in November 1831, she underwent minor repairs and departed again for the Mediterranean in April 1832 where she remained until an outbreak of cholera forced her to sail for home in November 1834.

In October 1835, &quot;Constellation&quot; sailed for the Gulf of Mexico to assist in defeating the Seminole uprising. The crew landed shore parties to relieve the Army garrisons and sent boats on amphibious expeditions. After the mission had been accomplished, they then cruised with the West India Squadron until 1838 serving part of this period in the capacity of flagship for Commodore Alexander Dallas.

The decade of the 1840s saw &quot;Constellation&quot; circumnavigate the globe. As flagship of Captain Kearny and the East India Squadron, their mission, as assigned in March 1841, was to safeguard American lives and property against loss during the Opium War, and further, to enable negotiation of commercial treaties. En route home in May 1843 she entered the Hawaiian Islands, helping to keep them from becoming a British protectorate, and thereafter sailed homeward making calls at South American ports.

==Fate==
In 1853 &quot;Constellation&quot; was disassembled at the Gosport Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia. At the same time, the keel was laid for what became known as the sloop-of-war . Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the United States Congress, the U.S. Navy, and the City of Baltimore continued to identify the ship as the 1854 rebuild of the 1797 ship. In the latter half of the 20th century, however, researchers discovered compelling evidence that the sloop-of-war was a wholly different ship, using only a minimal amount of material from the 1797 frigate.

Commemorative copper coins were struck from parts of &quot;Constellation&quot; and have become collector&#x27;s items.

<doc id="322059" wikidata="Q2116731" url="?curid=322059" title="Drumhead">
<text>A drumhead or drum skin is a membrane stretched over one or both of the open ends of a drum. The drumhead is struck with sticks, mallets, or hands, so that it vibrates and the sound resonates through the drum.

Additionally outside of percussion instruments, drumheads are also used on some string instruments, most notably the banjo.

==History==
Originally, drumheads were made from animal hide and were first used in early human history, long before records began. The term &quot;drumhead&quot; is first attested in English in 1580, in the writings of the soldier Thomas Churchyard, who mentioned how &quot;Dice plaie began ... on the toppe of Drommes heddes&quot;.

In 1956, Chick Evans invented the plastic drumhead. Plastic drumheads made from polyester are cheaper, more durable, and less sensitive to weather than animal skin. In 1957, Remo Belli and Sam Muchnick together developed a polymer head (also known as Mylar) leading to the development of the Remo drumhead company.

Despite the benefits of plastic heads, drummers in historical reenactment groups such as fife and drum use animal skin heads for historical accuracy. Rawhide heads are also popular with musicians performing in the jazz, orchestral and early music genres due to their preference for period correct sounds and instruments. Real hide heads are used on most hand drums, including djembes, frame drums, bongos, and congas, and also some Banjos. In recent years, companies have begun manufacturing synthetic counterparts (most notably Fiberskin) for certain hand drums such as congas, and also banjos. There has also been a resurgence in the use of genuine rawhide heads by drum kit players, with companies such as AF cueros orquestales from Argentina, AK Drums, Buchler Trommelbau and Kentville Drums or the Austrian Drumhead Company offering goat, calf and kangaroo hide drumheads respectively.

Another common material used for drumheads is aramid fiber, such as kevlar. Kevlar heads are also used in marching percussion.

===Mesh heads===
Mesh heads - drum heads that are usually constructed from a weave of synthetic material - were traditionally used on electronic drums, as they provide a very similar playing feel to traditional heads. Over time, however, manufacturers began to produce mesh heads that are attachable to acoustic drums, in order to create a playing experience that has a very similar feel and sound to playing a traditional drumkit, but at a drastically reduced volume, making them suitable for either practicing in a place where noise is a concern, or even recording using drum triggers.

==Tuning==
A drum &quot;hoop&quot; or &quot;rim&quot; may be made of metal, wood, or other material and is used to hold a drumhead against a drum shell, either with bolts through metal &quot;claws&quot; attached directly to a hoop, or bolts through holes in a flanged rim. The bolts, called &quot;tension rods&quot;, are screwed into threaded &quot;lugs&quot; attached to the drum shell, in order to tighten and tune the drumhead. A &quot;drum key&quot; is a four sided wrench used to screw the tension rods into the lugs.

== Muffling ==

Drummers occasionally muffle their drums using special drumheads. Some drumheads come pre-muffled. Most muffling is done by external muffles.

<text>USS &quot;Constellation&quot; is a sloop-of-war, the last sail-only warship designed and built by the United States Navy. She was built at the Gosport Shipyard between 1853 and 1855. She was named for the earlier frigate of the same name that had been broken up in 1853. The sloop&#x27;s primary armament was shell-firing guns and four 32-pounder long guns, though she carried other guns as well, including two Parrott rifle chase guns. &quot;Constellation&quot;″s career as a front-line unit was relatively short; after entering service in 1855, she served with the Mediterranean Squadron until 1858, and in 1859, she was assigned as the flagship of the Africa Squadron, where she served with the African Slave Trade Patrol. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the ship returned to the Mediterranean to patrol for Confederate vessels. In late 1864, she returned to the United States to be decommissioned, as most of her crews&#x27; enlistments had expired. She spent the rest of the war out of service.

&quot;Constellation&quot; was recommissioned in 1871 for use as a training ship, being used for shooting practice and training cruises for midshipmen. She filled this role for twenty-two years, and during this period, she saw a number of other activities, including transporting exhibits for the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris and carrying food to Ireland during the 1879 Irish famine. She was reduced to a stationary training hulk in late 1893, being moored in Newport for the next twenty years. During this period, the mistaken belief that the two &quot;Constellation&quot;s were one and the same arose, and she was presented as such in 1914 during the centennial of the writing of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the national anthem of the United States. Briefly renamed Old Constellation in 1917 to free the name for a new battlecruiser of the , she reverted to her original name when the battlecruiser was scrapped in 1925. &quot;Constellation&quot; was recommissioned in 1940 as part of the build-up in anticipation of the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, during which she served as the port flagship of the commander of the Atlantic Fleet.

Proposals to restore the vessel as a museum ship had been submitted already in the 1930s, but work began in earnest after World War II. Shortages of funds prevented her transfer to the city of Baltimore, Maryland until 1955. Operating under the mistaken belief that she was the original &quot;Constellation&quot;, the organization responsible for the ship modified her to match the earlier vessel&#x27;s appearance during a refit in the late 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, a controversy arose over the vessel&#x27;s identity that lasted into the 1990s, when new research definitively proved that the &quot;Constellation&quot; launched in 1797 and the 1854-launched vessel were distinct ships. Periodic repairs have been carried out since the mid-1990s to repair rotted wood. &quot;Constellation&quot; remains open to the public as part of the Historic Ships in Baltimore in the city&#x27;s Inner Harbor, having been designated a National Historic Landmark.

==Design and construction==
From 1816 to the 1830s, the Navy accumulated extensive stocks of live oak timbers for use in new warship construction under the provisions of the Act for the Gradual Increase of the Navy of the United States, passed in 1816. In the early 1850s, the Navy decided to build a new sail-powered ship using these existing stockpiles, calling for a sloop-of-war that would be fast, with a long endurance, and sufficiently armed to be capable of engaging other warships of her type. This would produce a capable warship while keeping costs low since the material used was already on hand and an expensive steam engine would not be required. Chief Constructor John Lenthall prepared the design, along with Edward Delano, the constructor of the Gosport Shipyard. In June 1853, Lenthall completed the hull half model, which was necessary to scale up the design and to prepare the necessary hull timbers. During this period, the new vessel&#x27;s namesake, , was in the process of being broken up a short distance away in the Gosport yard.

Beginning in May 1853, work on assembling the timbers commenced, as the shipyard workers prepared to start construction of the new sloop-of-war. The vessel&#x27;s keel was laid down on 25 June 1853, using material from the oak stockpile; her sternpost was erected on 27 August, and her stem followed a couple of weeks later. She was launched on 26 August 1854 at 11:45. Fitting-out work then commenced, which included the installation of her masts, rigging, and armament.

===Characteristics===
&quot;Constellation&quot; is long at the waterline and long overall. She has a beam of at the waterline, and is across at her widest point. Her maximum draft is at a full load displacement of . The ship&#x27;s crew numbered 21 officers and 265 enlisted men.

In her original configuration, &quot;Constellation&quot; was armed with a battery of sixteen shell-firing guns and four 32-pounder guns mounted on her gun deck in the main battery. On her spar deck, she carried a pair of chase guns; a 30-pounder Parrott rifle was placed in the bow and a 20-pounder Parrott rifle was placed in the stern. She also carried three 12-pounder boat howitzers.

==Service history==

&quot;Constellation&quot; was commissioned on 28 July 1855, under the command of Captain Charles H. Bell. She immediately departed for a tour with the Mediterranean Squadron that lasted three years. During this period, she stopped in Málaga, Spain in July 1856 to protect American nationals in the area during a period of civil unrest. Later that year, she came to the aid of a barque in the Sea of Marmara; the ship received an official thanks from the Emperor of Austria. On 17 April 1858, she left the Mediterranean Squadron for a short patrol in the Caribbean Sea to protect American shipping in the region. On 5 June she returned to the New York Navy Yard before proceeding to Boston, where she was decommissioned on 13 August.

In June 1859, she recommissioned for service with the Africa Squadron, where she served as the squadron flagship, under the command of Captain Thomas Aloysius Dornin. She arrived off the mouth of the Congo River on 21 November, where she began operating as part of the African Slave Trade Patrol. As part of its efforts to end the Atlantic slave trade, the Navy awarded prize money for each slave ship captured, along with a $25 bounty for each slave that was freed; these prizes were divided among the crew, based on rank. On 29 December, she captured the brig &quot;Delicia&quot; that had no papers and was fitted to carry slaves in her hold. On 26 September 1860, &quot;Constellation&quot; captured the barque &quot;Cora&quot;, which had 705 slaves aboard, who were then released in Monrovia, Liberia. The Navy impounded &quot;Cora&quot; and sold her at an auction.

===Civil War===
A week after the Battle of Fort Sumter, which began the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln declared a blockade of all ports of the Confederacy on 19 April 1861. A month later, on 21 May, &quot;Constellation&quot; captured another slave ship, again without any slaves aboard. In August, the Navy recalled &quot;Constellation&quot;, and she arrived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 28 September. She was dispatched to the Mediterranean on 11 March 1862 to patrol for Confederate commerce raiders attempting to attack Union merchant shipping, since her sails provided much greater endurance than steam-powered warships of the day. Commanded by Captain Henry Thatcher, &quot;Constellation&quot; arrived in the Mediterranean on 19 April. Over the course of the following two years, she patrolled the Mediterranean, but saw little action apart from the blockade of the blockade runner and commerce raider that was laid up in Gibraltar in need of repairs and refueling. She also blocked the Confederate Navy from taking possession of in Italy.

In May 1864, &quot;Constellation&quot; departed the Mediterranean, bound for the West Indies; Thatcher reasoned that since his ship was known to be patrolling the Mediterranean, and there were no other similar warships in the Navy, that he would be able to surprise Confederate cruisers and blockade runners. Admiral David Farragut recalled &quot;Constellation&quot; on 27 November; while en route, she chased a blockade runner but was unable to catch her. She reached Fort Monroe, Virginia on 25 December, and most of her crew, whose enlistments had ended, were discharged. Without a crew to man the vessel, &quot;Constellation&quot; spent the remainder of the war as a receiving ship based in Norfolk; she continued in this role until 1869.

===Post-war===
On 25 May 1871, &quot;Constellation&quot; was recommissioned for midshipmen training cruises; this was a duty she performed for the next 22 years. In 1871–1872, she was rearmed with eight Dahlgren guns, plus one 100-pound Parrott rifle and one Dahlgren gun, which would also allow her to be used as a gunnery training ship. From March to July 1878, &quot;Constellation&quot; was used to transfer exhibits to France for the Exposition Universelle in Paris. On 10 November 1879, she was sent to Gibraltar with a cargo of stores and a replacement crew for the Mediterranean Squadron flagship.

She was around the Azores on 24 November, during a week long storm, when she spotted a vessel in distress. The vessel was the Austro-Hungarian-flagged barque in sinking condition. &quot;Constellation&quot;″s boat rescued her crew and the vessel was scuttled by burning as the vessel was a hazard to navigation in her waterlogged condition. The ensign in charge of the boat was awarded the United States Life Saving Service&#x27;s Gold Lifesaving Medal, and medals from the Massachusetts Humane Society and the New York Life Saving Benevolent Association. After returning to New York, she was modified to carry a large cargo of food and other supplies to Ireland for the relief effort for the 1879 Irish famine. To accommodate as much food as possible, some of the ship&#x27;s guns were removed, along with some of her ballast. She was able to carry more than 2,500 barrels of flour and potatoes. She left the United States in March 1880 and arrived in Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland on 20 April, where she sent the food ashore, took on ballast, and returned to the United States, arriving in June.

In September 1892, &quot;Constellation&quot; recommissioned for another unusual duty, to help assemble works of art in Gibraltar for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. During the cruise, she made stops in Naples, Italy and Le Havre, France, before returning to New York in February 1893. Another training cruise to Gibraltar followed on 3 June and ended on 29 August. She was then transferred to Annapolis, where she was decommissioned on 2 September before being towed to Norfolk for repairs. There, she was converted into a stationary training ship. She was moved to Newport on 22 May 1894, where she remained largely in port for the next twenty years, apart from periodic trips for maintenance. This included an extensive repair in the New York Navy Yard in June 1904.

In 1914, &quot;Constellation&quot; took part in celebration commemorating the one-hundredth anniversary of the writing of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the national anthem of the United States. Then-Acting Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the Navy to restore &quot;Constellation&quot; to her appearance in 1814 (as at the time, the Navy believed this ship to have been the one launched in 1797; see the Identity controversy section below), but to limit the work to general details to reduce costs. As a result, her bridge platform, which had been installed in the 1880s, was removed, along with a deck house that had been erected in the 1890s. She was then towed to Baltimore, where she was on display from 7 September to 29 October, when she was towed to Washington, DC. She remained on display there from 31 October to 4 December. Repairs in Norfolk followed later that month, and she resumed training duties on 19 May 1915.
&quot;Constellation&quot; was renamed &quot;Old Constellation&quot; on 1 December 1917, since the name was to be used for a new that had been ordered. In 1920, the Navy stopped training sailors in handling sails and rigging, significantly reducing &quot;Old Constellation&quot;″s activity. On 24 July 1925, the ship reverted to her original name when the battlecruiser was scrapped under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. &quot;Constellation&quot; was towed to Philadelphia on 15 May 1926 and moored alongside the protected cruiser , which had been Admiral George Dewey&#x27;s flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War in 1898. There, on 4 July 1926, she participated in ceremonies for the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Following the celebration, she was dry-docked in Philadelphia for maintenance and then was towed back to Newport in November.

The Navy Department ordered that &quot;Constellation&quot; be decommissioned for preservation on 16 June 1933. The Navy conducted surveys of the ship and prepared cost estimates for the work needed to restore her, but no work was done. With World War II having broken out in Europe in 1939, &quot;Constellation&quot; was recommissioned on 24 August 1940 and assigned the hull number IX-20 on 8 January 1941 as part of the United States&#x27; prewar buildup. She became the reserve flagship for Admiral Ernest J. King, the commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, until he became the Chief of Naval Operations in early 1942. King was replaced by Vice Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, who came aboard &quot;Constellation&quot; from 19 January to 20 July, when he transferred to the gunboat . Ingersoll returned to &quot;Constellation&quot; from 1943 to 1944. After the war in October 1946, the Navy began work on plans to turn the ship into a memorial in Boston, but lacked the funds to do the necessary work. Finally, she was decommissioned on 4 February 1955 and towed to Baltimore, where she was dry-docked for restoration by a private, non-profit organization. She arrived there on 9 August, and was stricken from the naval register on 15 August.

==Restoration and museum ship==
During the initial reconstruction to ready the ship for use as a museum, and under the mistaken impression that the 1797 frigate and the 1854 sloop were the same vessel, the workers reconfigured &quot;Constellation&quot; to resemble the 1797 vessel. During this period, she was designated a National Historic Landmark on 23 May 1963 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on 15 October 1966. In 1968, she was moved to Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor, moored at Constellation Dock.

By the 1990s, &quot;Constellation&quot; was in poor condition owing to a lack of maintenance for many years. Problems included dry rot, compromised structural integrity, and a significant of hogging in her keel. She was towed to a drydock at Locust Point, near Fort McHenry, in 1996, and a $7.3 million rebuilding and restoration project was undertaken and completed in 1999. About half of her original but badly-rotted wood was replaced. The restoration was funded in equal shares by private donations, the City of Baltimore, and the State of Maryland.

In 2004, the United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp commemorating the ship at the 150th anniversary of her launching; its design was based on the vessel as pictured in 1893.

On 26 October 2004, &quot;Constellation&quot; made her first trip out of Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor since 1955, and her first to Annapolis since 1893. The trip to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis took about eight hours and her visit lasted six days. While there, she was available for public tours from 27 to 31 October. The vessel was towed to and from Annapolis, as her rigging and ballast were not in a condition to allow her to sail on her own.

In 2011, significant rot was discovered in the ship&#x27;s hull during routine maintenance; many of the affected timbers had been installed during the refit in the 1990s. After raising funds to cover the cost of the reconstruction, the ship was dry docked at the United States Coast Guard Yard just to the south of Baltimore in October 2014. The project cost about $2 million and was completed in February 2015. Further repairs were necessitated in mid-2016 after some hull planks were found to have rotted.

The ship is now part of Historic Ships in Baltimore, which also operates the Coast Guard cutter WHEC-37, the World War II submarine , the , and the Seven Foot Knoll Light. &quot;Constellation&quot; and her companions are major contributing elements in the Baltimore National Heritage Area. She is the last existing intact naval vessel from the American Civil War, and she was the last solely wind-powered warship built by the U.S. Navy.

==Identity controversy==

The city of Baltimore and the organization that maintained &quot;Constellation&quot; promoted the ship as having been the 1797 frigate and even rebuilt sections of the ship to resemble the earlier vessel. Additionally, they relied on the fact that some of the funds used to build the sloop were originally allocated to rebuild the frigate, the incorrect assertion that the keel and futtocks from the broken-up frigate were used in the construction of the sloop, and that at the time of her donation to the city, the Navy insisted that the vessel was the original frigate launched in 1797. They also relied on a series of forged documents that had been created in the 1960s to support their position. The amateur historian Geoffrey M. Footner continued to support the assertion that the ship was rebuilt in 1854 but traces its lineage to 1797.

Starting shortly after World War II, a controversy arose over whether the 1854 sloop was a new ship or a rebuilt version of the 1797 frigate. Naval architect Howard I. Chapelle was one of the first people to raise the issue. In his book &quot;The History of the American Sailing Navy&quot;, published in 1949, he pointed out the differences in the hull dimensions of the 1797 &quot;Constellation&quot; and the 1854 &quot;Constellation&quot; as evidence that they were two different ships. He also stated that, &quot;Unfortunately, some of the semi-official lists of American naval ships have listed [the original &quot;Constellation&quot;] as though she had, in fact, been preserved and altered. This has led to many believing the sloop-of-war, which is still in existence, to be the oldest ship in the Navy and to have had a continuous identity since 1797...the only reason her register was maintained, by means of an administrative fiction, was to enable the work to be done without the need of applying to Congress for authority and funds to build an entirely new ship.&quot; Stephen Bockmiller and Lawrence Bopp agree with Chapelle, writing in &quot;USS Constellation: An Illustrated History&quot;, that &quot;working under the subterfuge of &#x27;repairs,&#x27; the Navy actually began building a new ship about 900 yards from where the original &quot;Constellation&quot; was being dismantled. Thus, unwittingly, the Navy itself would originate the arguments about the authenticity of the &quot;Constellation&quot;. To further compound the argument, some salvageable timbers from the original ship, particularly the ship’s knees, were used in constructing the new vessel.&quot;

In the United States Navy&#x27;s deed of custody given to the city of Baltimore in 1954 to repair and display &quot;Constellation&quot;, Rear Admiral John R. Hefferman assured Baltimore of its unbroken provenance, stating that &quot;Nowhere in these records, however, is there any indication that the original &quot;Constellation&quot;, launched in 1797, was in fact broken up, stranded, scrapped or otherwise disposed of, nor is there any statement authorizing or sanctioning the disposal of the ship by any means whatsoever.&quot; In &quot;USS Constellation on the Dismal Coast&quot;, published in 2013, C. Herbert Gilliland wrote, &quot; For much of the twentieth century, this ship was believed to be the 1797 frigate &quot;Constellation&quot;. In fact, however, when the 1797 frigate was being dismantled at the Gosport Navy Yard near Norfolk, Virginia, work was beginning on the 1854 sloop, likely reusing some timber from the old ship in building this very new one. The misidentification was maintained by deliberate deception, apparently to enhance the likelihood of the ship&#x27;s being preserved as a historic relic. Naval records and the evidence from the extant ship&#x27;s hull, though, make it clear that the vessel floating today dates from 1854.&quot;

In September 1991, researchers Dana M. Wegner and Colan Ratliff from the David Taylor Research Center and Kevin Lynaugh, from the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, published an exhaustive report on the question. Their research noted several key pieces of historical evidence that the two ships were not the same vessel. This included the fact that the timbers from the dismantled 1797 &quot;Constellation&quot; were auctioned off after the ship-breaking process ended in September 1853, the fact that the keel-laying for the 1854 ship had been done in June 1853, before the 1797 ship had been dismantled completely, and building records that meticulously accounted for each piece of timber that was used to build the new ship; in fact, only 204 oak knees were re-used, but these came from existing stocks, not the original vessel and they stated that, &quot;There was no evidence that any material was transferred directly from the old ship to the new.&quot; In March 1989, they had come upon the builder&#x27;s half-hull model of &quot;Constellation&quot; in the U.S. Naval Academy Museum. This was important because half-hull models are only built for new designs, not rebuilds, and the use of half-hull models was not introduced until after 1797. The authors conclude that this is definitive evidence that the vessel launched in 1854 was new, as it was &quot;impossible to accurately scale down the form of an existing ship to model format,&quot; and that &quot;a new half model would not have been employed by Lenthall unless he was forging a fully new design.&quot;

In addition to evaluating the half model, the researchers also reviewed all the evidence used in the debate to date. With the help of FBI and BATF forensics investigators, they concluded that some 25 to 30 documents supporting the ship being a rebuild were forgeries. In 1991, they published their findings and conclusion that the current &quot;Constellation&quot; and the original frigate are two different ships. The authors did not agree with Chapelle, however, over the nature of the new ship&#x27;s construction; they pointed out that the Act for the Gradual Increase authorized the Navy to build new ships from the oak acquired under its provisions, so there was no need to subvert Congress&#x27;s authority on the matter. Lynaugh summarized the report in a separate article published in 1993, &quot;Discussion of the Origins of the Frigate and the Sloop Constellation&quot;, and concluded that &quot;though not built in Baltimore in 1797, the present ship was the last sail-only powered warship designed and built by the U.S. Navy. As such, it is a rare artifact of first importance and truly deserves to be preserved and displayed for the American public.&quot;

Indeed, the &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; (DANFS), the official reference work for vessels of the US Navy, has exemplified and evolved with this identity controversy. In its 1969 edition it stated that the original &quot;Constellation&quot; was &quot;Laid up in ordinary at Norfolk from 1845 through 1853, she was found to be greatly in need of extensive repair. Thus, in 1854 she was brought into the yard and, in keeping with the needs of the time, modified into a 22-gun sloop-of-war.&quot; By its 2004 edition this had been modified to state the original &quot;Constellation&quot; was broken up at Norfolk in 1853.

For its part, Historic Ships in Baltimore, the organization that operates the museum of which &quot;Constellation&quot; is a part, does not present the ship as having been the original vessel. They instead acknowledge that the first vessel was broken up in 1853, and present the accounts provided by more recent editions of DANFS. Its predecessor organization, the U.S.F. Constellation Foundation, had maintained the opposite policy until its board resigned in 1994 and was replaced by advocates of the new-ship school of thought.

<text>Supreme Allied Commander is the title held by the most senior commander within certain multinational military alliances. It originated as a term used by the Allies during World War I, and is currently used only within NATO for Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Supreme Allied Commander Transformation.

==Historical titles==
===World War I===
On 26 March 1918, the French marshal Ferdinand Foch was appointed Supreme Allied Commander, gaining command of all Allied forces everywhere, and coordinated the British, French, American, and Italian armies to stop the German spring offensive, the last large offensive of the German Empire. He was the one who accepted the German cessation of hostilities in his private train.

On 16 April 1918, at his own request, Foch was appointed &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies&quot;. Despite his promotion 19 days earlier, and the subsequent Beauvais Conference of 3 April 1918, he was not provided a title. He remedied this by making up his own title and by writing to Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau to request it, which was immediately granted.

===World War II===

During World War II, the Allied leaders appointed Supreme Allied Commanders to manage the multi-nation, multi-discipline fighting forces for a particular theater of war. These Supreme Allied Commanders were given operational control over all air, land, and sea units in that theatre. In other cases, senior commanders were given the title Commander-in-Chief.

These Supreme Allied Commanders were drawn from the most senior leaders in the British Armed Forces and United States Armed Forces. These commanders reported to the British/American Combined Chiefs of Staff, although in the case of the Pacific and South East Asia, the relevant national command authorities of the American Joint Chiefs of Staff or the British Chiefs of Staff Committee had responsibility for the main conduct of the war in the theatre, depending on the Supreme Commander&#x27;s nationality.

General of the United States&#x27; Army Dwight D. Eisenhower served in successive Supreme Allied Commander roles. Eisenhower was the Commander-in-Chief, Allied Force for the Mediterranean theatre. Eisenhower then served as Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force (SCAEF) in the European theatre, starting in December 1943 with the creation of the command to execute Operation Overlord and ending in July 1945 shortly after the End of World War II in Europe. In 1951, Eisenhower would again be a Supreme Allied Commander, the first to hold the post for NATO (see next section).

Field Marshal Henry Maitland Wilson succeeded Eisenhower in the Mediterranean theatre, given the title Supreme Allied Commander Mediterranean. Wilson was succeeded by Field Marshal Harold Alexander, who continued in charge of those Allied forces until the end of the war.

Admiral of the Fleet Lord Louis Mountbatten was Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia (SACSEA) throughout most of its existence. He replaced General Archibald Wavell.

Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was named the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in China Theater on 1942. However, US forces in China were usually overseen by General Joseph Stilwell, the commander of China Burma India Theater (CBI) and Deputy Allied Commander of South East Asia Command (SEAC). It was not until late 1944 that the land forces chain of command was clarified, after Stilwell was recalled to Washington. His overall role, and the CBI command were then split among three people: Lt Gen. Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia; Maj. Gen. Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang, and commander of US Forces, China Theater (USFCT). Lt Gen. Daniel Sultan was promoted, from deputy commander of CBI to commander of US Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC.

General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was appointed Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area (SWPA) on 18 April 1942. However, he preferred to use the title Commander-in-Chief. During the Allied occupation of Japan following the war, MacArthur held the title of Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP). The Pacific Ocean Areas (POA), divided into the Central Pacific Area, the North Pacific Area and the South Pacific Area, were commanded by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas.

Although not bearing any official title of Supreme Allied Commander, Joseph Stalin, as Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Armed Forces, as well as the commanders of the 1st Belorussian, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts of the Soviet Red Army - Zhukov, Rokossovsky, Konev, Malinovsky, Tolbukhin, Sokolovsky, Yeremenko, Petrov, Vatutin, etc. - acted in de facto capacity of Supreme Allied Commanders in that units of foreign Allied armies were incorporated into the fronts&#x27; order of battle and fought against the European Axis powers under their command during the Great Patriotic War: the Polish Armed Forces in the East, 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps, French Normandie-Niemen Fighter Regiment and Romanian Tudor Vladimirescu Division from 1943, then from 1944 until the end of the war also the Romanian Army, Bulgarian Army and Yugoslav National Liberation Army.

After the end of the Soviet Union&#x27;s European theater of World War II, during the Soviet-Japanese War, the commanders of the Red Army&#x27;s 1st and 2nd Far Eastern fronts and Transbaikal Front - Vasilevsky (in overall command of all three fronts), Malinovsky, Meretskov and Purkayev - once again acted in de facto capacity of Supreme Allied Commanders as the Mongolian People&#x27;s Army and partisans of the Chinese Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and Korean People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army were incorporated into their order of battle for the liberation of Northern China, Northeastern China and northern Korea from Japanese imperialist occupation.

==Cold War-era to present-day titles==

The term came into use again with the formation of NATO in 1949. In 1952, Allied Command Europe was established, led by Eisenhower. He became the &quot;Supreme Allied Commander&quot; (SACEUR). Soon afterwards, Allied Command Atlantic was established, at Norfolk, Virginia, under Lynde McCormick, a U.S. Navy admiral. His title was &quot;Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic&quot; (SACLANT), and the entire command was usually known as SACLANT. Both Supreme Commanders have, until 2009, been American, with a deputy commander from another NATO member, though only British and Germans have held the post.

Responding to the establishment of NATO, the Warsaw Pact was established in 1955 along with their own posts of United Armed Forces Supreme Commander and Chief of Combined Staff. Until the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, both posts had always been held by a Marshal of the Soviet Union or Army General due to their expertise in commanding and coordinating forces of enormous sizes in the Soviet Armed Forces.

In June 2003, the commands were reshuffled. One command was given responsibility for operations, and one for transforming the military components of the alliance to meet new challenges. In Europe, Allied Command Operations was established from the former Allied Command Europe, and given responsibility for all NATO military operations worldwide. However, for legal reasons, SACEUR retained the traditional title including Europe. In the United States, SACLANT was decommissioned and Allied Command Transformation established. The headquarters of ACT is at the former SACLANT headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. Each has a Supreme Allied Commander as its commander.

* Allied Command Operations (ACO) has its headquarters at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), at Mons, Belgium. It is headed by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), a U.S. four-star general or admiral also heading U.S. European Command. The current Commander is General Christopher G. Cavoli (Army), who succeeded General Tod Wolters (Air Force).
* Allied Command Transformation (ACT) is located in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. It is headed by the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT), a four-star general or admiral. General Stéphane Abrial, the commander from 2009 until 2012, was the first non-American to hold a supreme commander role within NATO. Since then this position has been held by a French Air Force officer. The commander of the organization is currently General Philippe Lavigne.

<doc id="322064" wikidata="Q6601784" url="?curid=322064" title="List of United States Air Force installations">
<text>This is a list of installations operated by the United States Air Force located within the United States and abroad. Locations where the Air Force have a notable presence but do not operate the facility are also listed.

== Background ==
The location and number of US Air Force installations has fluctuated according to the size of the Air Force, the capabilities of available weapon systems, and the strategies contemplated for their employment. The number of active duty Air Force Bases within the United States rose from 115 in 1947 to peak at 162 in 1956 before declining to 69 in 2003 and 59 in 2020. This change reflects a Cold War expansion, retirement of much of the strategic bomber force, and the post–Cold War draw-down. Over time, the USAF has constantly realigned its forces within the network of bases to reflect current needs and strategies.

The Air Force use several terms to identify the different type of installations it operates:

* &quot;Air Force Base&quot;, &quot;Air Reserve Base&quot; or &quot;Air Guard Base&quot; are used to describe an installation from which aircraft operations can be conducted or from which major activities of importance to Air Force combat, combat support, or training missions can be supported.
* &quot;Air Force Station (&quot;sometimes &quot;Air Station)&quot;, &quot;Air Reserve Station&quot; or &quot;Air National Guard Station&quot; is used to name installations, typically but not exclusively without a flying mission, that are operated by a unit of at least squadron size, that does not otherwise meet the criteria of being a base.
* &quot;Air Force Auxiliary Airfield&quot; is used if the installation has an aircraft operating area that provides operational activities in support of a primary installation and depends upon a primary installation for administrative and logistical support.
* &quot;Air Base&quot; is typically but not always used to name an installation located outside the United States or its territories.

Active duty Installations are normally named after notable Air Force personnel, whereas Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard installations are either named in the same manner or after the community in which they are located.

== United States ==
Installations and locations in the contiguous United States. For Alaska and Hawaii see Pacific, East Asia and South East Asia section.

===Active Duty===
Active-duty USAF bases in the United States are under the jurisdiction of the following Major Commands. There are 57 Active Bases across the country:
===Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve===
Air National Guard units are a reserve military force composed of state Air National Guard members or federally recognized units and report to the governor of their respective state, territory (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands) or the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard. Each of the 54 Air National Guard organizations is supervised by the adjutant general of the state or territory,
Air Force Reserve units are aligned under Fourth Air Force, Tenth Air Force and Twenty-Second Air Force of the Air Force Reserve Command. The command has Fighter, Air Refueling and Airlift units, and is administratively responsible for all the Air Force&#x27;s individual mobilization augmentees.

The origin of the name &quot;Changsha&quot; is lost in antiquity. The name first appeared known in the &quot;Yi Zhou Shu&quot; in the 11 century BCE during the reign of King Cheng of the Zhou dynasty. A vassal lord from the Changsha area sent a type of softshell turtle known as &quot;Changsha softshell turtle&quot; () to the Zhou king as a tribute. The present Changsha County was parts of the historic Qianzhong Commandery of Chu state in late Warring States period (481 BC to 221 BC) and the historic Xiang County () in Qin dynasty (221 BC–206 BC). During the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), Xiang County was renamed Linxiang County (). Changsha County was formally established with the replacement of the Linxiang County, concurrent with the establishment of the Sui dynasty. Shanhua County () was formed from 5 townships of Changsha County and 2 townships of Xiangtan County in 1098 AD during the Song dynasty. Changsha and Shanhua Counties were merged into modern day Changsha County in 1912.

==History==
According to historical relics discovered in Yong’an Middle School&#x27;s construction site in 1991, in the Old Stone Age, there were people living in Liuyang. In the eastern Han dynasty (in 209 AD), Liuyang was established as a county, and its government was located in Juling (now the northern Guandu). In the Tang dynasty, the government was moved to Huaichuan (now the Huaichuan Street), and in the Yuan dynasty (in 1295 AD), the government was moved back to Juling, and Liuyang became a “state”. In the Ming dynasty (in 1369 AD), Liuyang was degraded as a county, and its government was moved to Huaichuan again.
In the eastern Han dynasty, Sun Quan set Liuyang (). In the Three Kingdoms-Wu, Liuyang belonged to Changsha Prefecture. In the Liu Song period of Southern Dynasties, the name was changed from Liuyang () to Liuyang (), and the new name is used until now. In the Sui dynasty, Liuyang was merged into Changsha, and in the Tang dynasty (in 708 AD) Liuyang was established as a county again. In the Sui dynasty and the Tang dynasty, Liuyang belonged to Tanzhou. In the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty, Liuyang belonged to Changsha.

<text>The Taipei Times is an English-language print newspaper in Taiwan published by the Liberty Times Group. Founded as the third English-language newspaper on 15 June 1999, it is currently the last surviving English-language print newspaper in Taiwan. 

== History ==
Published by the Liberty Times Group, the &quot;Taipei Times&quot; launched its first edition on 15 June 1999. It was the third English-language newspaper founded in Taiwan. President Lee Teng-hui attended its launch ceremony. The other two English-language media before the &quot;Taipei Times&quot; were &quot;Taiwan News&quot; and &quot;The&quot; &quot;China Post&quot;.

In a column celebrating the paper&#x27;s fifth anniversary, then-&quot;Taipei Times&quot; associate editor Laurence Eyton wrote that much of the initial planning of the paper was concluded over pints of Carlsberg in a pub with Anthony Lawrence, the paper&#x27;s first managing editor. In 2002, the daily circulation stood at 280,000 copies.

By 2017, the &quot;Taipei Times&quot; had become the last daily print newspaper in Taiwan, after competitors &quot;Taiwan News&quot; and &quot;China Post&quot; switched to digital-only formats. 

The &quot;Taipei Times&quot; has been involved in several controversies over the years, including an argument with a member of the United States House of Representatives, a push for nuclear weapons under President Chen Shui-bian, and misleading readers about the origin of a letter to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

== Editorial positions ==

Its editorial position leans toward Taiwan independence, and supports the development of Taiwan&#x27;s own nuclear arsenal. It is a participant in Project Syndicate.

<doc id="322085" wikidata="Q2297125" url="?curid=322085" title="Xorn">
<text>Xorn is the alias of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in &quot;New X-Men Annual 2001&quot; (September 2001), he was created by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely. He is a mutant who has a miniature star residing in his head, that gives him the abilities of gravitational electromagnetism, self-sustenance, and healing. He is most commonly associated with the X-Men and Brotherhood of Mutants. Initially in the pages of New X-Men, he was revealed to be Magneto in disguise. However, Excalibur established him as a separate character named Kuan-Yin Xorn and his brother Shen Zorn.

==Publication history==
Xorn first appeared in &quot;New X-Men Annual 2001&quot; (September 2001), Xorn was created by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely. Originally depicted as a Chinese mutant with a &quot;star for a brain,&quot; he is eventually revealed to be the X-Men&#x27;s nemesis Magneto in disguise at the climax of Morrison&#x27;s run. After Magneto is apparently killed during the &quot;Planet X&quot; story arc, he appears alive in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 3) #1, which established that Xorn never was Magneto. Marvel has presented several partial explanations, both in the comics pages and in the press as to the true nature, identity, and motives of Xorn.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;New X-Men&quot;===
Xorn debuts in &quot;New X-Men&quot; Annual 2001 imprisoned by the Chinese government, where a corrupt mutant official offers to sell him to John Sublime. While in the prison of Feng Tu, Xorn is forced to wear a skull-like mask designed to restrain his energy output as he has a &quot;sun&quot; for a brain in his head. The X-Men and Sublime&#x27;s U-Men find Xorn just as he is attempting to commit suicide by removing his mask, which would destroy the Earth. Cyclops (with the help of Emma Frost) is able to establish contact with Xorn, convincing him not to kill himself, and offers him a position among the X-Men. Xorn is next seen in &quot;New X-Men&quot; #122, where Cyclops tracks him down to a monastery, where he is told by the monks that Xorn has demonstrated healing powers. The pair are captured by the Shi&#x27;ar but arrive at the X-Mansion in time for Xorn to heal the X-Men of a nano-Sentinel infection, restoring Professor Xavier&#x27;s ability to walk in the process.

Despite the ordeals through which he had passed, Xorn is optimistic, open, and even somewhat naïve. Xorn keeps a diary to share his thoughts with Professor Xavier, since Xavier is &quot;blinded by the sun beneath [his] mask&quot; and cannot read his mind. Here he details his interactions with Chinese immigrants and the residents of Mutant Town in New York City, in particular an incident where he failed to save a young mutant from being killed by frightened policemen. Xorn is soon put in charge of the &quot;Special Class&quot;, a group of physical and social misfits attending the Xavier Institute. Though he hopes to befriend these students, he becomes disillusioned as they mock and insult him. He remains determined to help his Special Class, even saving their lives from a group of U-Men.
In the storyline &quot;Planet X&quot;, Xorn removes his mask, revealing himself to be the X-Men&#x27;s nemesis Magneto, who has been believed dead since the destruction of Genosha. Magneto explains the Xorn identity was an elaborate ruse crafted with the help of Chinese supporters. Having returned Xavier to a crippled state (Xavier had not been healed; Magneto merely used the nano-Sentinels to &quot;glue&quot; his spine together), Magneto levels the X-Mansion and conquers New York City, where he enslaves the human population and destroys much of the city. He attempts to recreate the Brotherhood with Toad, the rebellious Stepford Cuckoo Esme, and the members of Xorn&#x27;s Special Class.

Magneto finds, however, that many of his recruits are unresponsive to his ideas and approach, with some asking for the return of the more humane Xorn, and others doubtful that Magneto has truly returned, much to his chagrin. Indecisive and relying heavily on the drug Kick to augment his power, he struggles to maintain the loyalty and respect of his followers. He announces a plan to invert the planet by reversing its magnetic poles, and employs increasingly fascistic methods (including the construction of a Nazi-esque crematorium in which he plans to eradicate the remaining human population of the city). He also appears to be experiencing a form of dissociative identity disorder, as the &quot;Xorn&quot; persona begins to manifest itself as a voice within Magneto&#x27;s head, claiming to be the embodiment of Magneto&#x27;s wisdom, idealism, and nobility. After his defeat at the hands of the X-Men, but before his capture, he fatally wounds Jean Grey; Wolverine, in a berserk fury over Grey&#x27;s death, kills him.

===The return of Magneto and the second Xorn===
Grant Morrison intended Xorn to be Magneto from his first appearance. As Morrison stated in an interview after they left &quot;New X-Men&quot;, &quot;In my opinion, there really should not have been an actual Xorn - he had to be fake, that was the cruel point of him&quot;. In fact, soon after the revelation of Xorn&#x27;s identity in &quot;New X-Men&quot; #146, readers pointed out that clues that Xorn was actually Magneto had been hidden throughout Morrison&#x27;s run. According to then-&quot;X-Men&quot; writer Chuck Austen, the X-Men editors liked the Xorn character and hoped Morrison would change their mind about the revelation; when Morrison did not, the editors asked Austen to bring Xorn back as a separate character. Morrison has expressed criticism of this subsequent retcon in interviews. Marvel also wanted to continue using Magneto; Austen stated that &quot;Marvel saw value in Magneto not being a mass-murderer of New Yorkers.&quot;

Marvel retconned the Xorn/Magneto revelation and brought back Xorn and Magneto after Morrison&#x27;s departure. In &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #442 and 443, Xavier takes the body of Magneto to Genosha where they hold a funeral for the deceased mutant leader. However, in the last page of &quot;Excalibur&quot; (vol. 3) #1, Xavier meets Magneto alive and well on Genosha. In subsequent issues of &quot;Excalibur&quot;, Xavier and Magneto debate the true identity and motives of Xorn, the individual whose bandage-wrapped body they brought to Genosha. In the same month Magneto returned in Chris Claremont&#x27;s new &quot;Excalibur&quot; book, Austen&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #157 introduced a new Xorn named Shen Xorn. Shen Xorn claims to be the twin brother of the original Xorn (now referred to as Kuan-Yin Xorn) who, under the influence of the entity known as Sublime, had pretended to be Magneto. This claim is supported when Emma Frost conducts a thorough mind scan of Shen. Not too long after, Shen Xorn disappears after he unleashes the gravitational forces of his &quot;black hole&quot; for a brain from his head (in direct contrast to his twin brother) in the course of helping the X-Men defeat an attack by a Brotherhood of Mutants led by Exodus.

Xorn and Magneto are among the mutants who lost their powers to the Scarlet Witch during the &quot;Decimation&quot; event.

The true identity of Xorn, and his relationship to the character Magneto, became a subject of confusion for fans. Marvel refrained from giving any complete explanation, eventually hinting the summer 2005 crossover &quot;House of M&quot; would clear up the situation. The Xorn entry in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2005&quot; stated that &quot;Kuan-Yin eventually revealed himself to be a &quot;duplicate&quot; of the X-Men&#x27;s nemesis Magneto, a transformation believed to have been caused by Magneto&#x27;s daughter, the Scarlet Witch.&quot; This explanation was based on a suggestion in &quot;House of M&quot; #7 wherein Doctor Strange speculates Wanda has been &#x27;playing with the world&#x27; for far longer than even she knows, and may have been responsible for her father&#x27;s puzzling rebirth. An alternative explanation has since been given in the pages of &quot;New Avengers&quot; since, according to Marvel editor Tom Brevoort, &quot;nobody was satisfied with that offhanded non-explanation, and it didn&#x27;t make a heck of a lot of sense by itself even as a throwaway&quot;.

===The Collective===
Later, an Alaskan postal worker named Michael Pointer gains the powers of the depowered mutants, in part due to being a mutant himself. Disoriented and wielding the power of at least fifty mutants, he rampages across rural Canada, encounters Alpha Flight, and destroys downtown Cleveland. While Iron Man assists the Sentry in a battle with him that ranges between the orbits of Earth and Mars, Spider-Man and the Vision discover the nature of Michael&#x27;s powers. At that point, having determined it to be the best option, S.H.I.E.L.D. has Iron Man let Michael go, and as he learned to fly during the fight, he is able to travel without endangering any more civilians to what is revealed to be his destination, Genosha.

Once there, the collective of energy, now revealed to be sentient and responsible for Michael&#x27;s actions, transfers into and repowers Magneto, who recognizes the intelligence controlling it as Xorn as the New Avengers arrive. Xorn explains he took the image of Magneto because he knew mutants would follow him, and they needed the real Magneto again. Reference is made to Xorn&#x27;s confusing history as Vision comments his files on Xorn are incomplete and Wolverine comments, &quot;Xorn&#x27;s files on Xorn are incomplete&quot;, demonstrating of how not even Xorn seems to know who he is. Quake, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, and Sentry combine their powers to separate the Collective/Xorn from Magneto and send it into the sun; despite being separated from the Collective, Pointer still has some of its powers, and joins Omega Flight using a suit designed to harness his powers.

In a 2006 interview, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada reiterated the Shen Xorn/Kuan-Yin Xorn explanation, but added that &quot;because Xorn&#x27;s powers were psychokinetic, and his personality was so strong, it basically remained an almost disembodied sentient thing among the big ball of mutant energy. When that energy got sucked down to Earth by Michael and all absorbed by him, Xorn was the dominant personality in the mix, and that&#x27;s what drove him towards Genosha and Magneto.&quot;

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
When the Terrigen Mists were released around the globe, whittling down mutantkind&#x27;s number and suppressing any new mutant manifestation, a militant band composed of Inhumans and Mutants known as the Dark Riders, who long believed in &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, began gunning down all mutant healers, one such mutant is Shen Xorn, who is revealed to have been repowered somehow (it can be assumed that he was repowered by his own twin brother off-panel during the Collective arc) and has now secluded himself somewhere in Tibet. He is able to kill Barrage and make quick work of the rest of the Riders after they chose to battle instead of have tea.

During HYDRA&#x27;s overthrow of the United States government as seen in the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Shen Xorn is chosen to lead New Tian, a sovereign nation created for mutants in California. It is later revealed that Emma Frost is the true leader of New Tian and Xorn is the puppet ruler that she controls with her telepathy.

=== House of X ===
Following the consolidation of Mutant peoples on Krakoa during the &quot;House of X&quot; storyline, Kuan-Yin Xorn is resurrected through Krakoa&#x27;s Resurrection Protocols. The Xorn brothers (now calling themselves Xorn and Zorn) remain on Krakoa and occasionally lend their powers to other mutants&#x27; causes - such as David Haller&#x27;s work as a community healer.

==Reception==
In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Xorn 55th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the 10th anniversary of the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; which takes place right after the nuclear attack by the Human High Council, Xorn is found by the X-Men in the Breeding Pens following the fall of Apocalypse. In this reality Xorn is female and claimed that her mutant abilities manifested while she and her family were workers in the Seattle Core during the riots that killed the members of Generation Next. Magneto immediately offered her a place with the X-Men.

During her time with the team, Xorn never removed her helmet causing some to believe it contained her energy powers while others in the X-Men whispered that the helmet truly concealed hideous scars from her time in the Core. However the truth was that Xorn was actually the thought deceased Husk who had been manipulated by Mister Sinister and assumed the identity of Xorn and used her husking abilities to enable herself to demonstrate many different powers, in order to infiltrate the X-Men and kill Magneto and Rogue&#x27;s son, Charles.

===Battle of the Atom===
A new, female version called Lady Xorn later appears as part of a future team of X-Men that travels back to the present during the &quot;Battle of the Atom&quot; event. This Xorn is later revealed to be an adult version of the &quot;young&quot; time-displaced Jean Grey, who needed the Xorn mask to control her powers. The team of X-Men she was with was actually the Brotherhood of Mutants from the future, the nemesis of the true X-Men, and she died when her powers went out of control in a battle between the X-Men and the future Brotherhood at Cape Citadel. Xorn later returns alive, and once again battles the X-Men with the rest of the future Brotherhood. However, it is subsequently revealed that this Xorn was just a puppet figure created by Charles Xavier II&#x27;s mind powers after the real Xorn died during her final confrontation with her younger self. The former Brotherhood are freed from Charles Xavier II&#x27;s influence and are returned to their timeline.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Xorn (Kuan-Yi) and his twin brother Zorn (Shen-Yi) first appeared in the miniseries &quot;Ultimate Comics: Hawkeye&quot; and spread out to be included in other titles like &quot;Ultimate Comics: Ultimates&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Comics: X-Men&quot;. The Twins become the leaders of &quot;The People&quot;, a genetically altered species of superhumans that were produced by the Southeast Asian Republic/SEAR as super-soldiers, but later rebelled. The People are in possession of a Super-Soldier Serum that Hawkeye is tasked by SHIELD with retrieving. This led to Shen forming the Eternals, while Kuan formed the Celestials. Hawkeye later leads Nick Fury, the Falcon, and Black Widow to the twin capital cities of SEAR in order to meet with Xorn and Zorn. The two brothers agree to help Fury fight off the Maker&#x27;s invasion.

===Earth-71202===
On an alternate Earth, Xorn and his brother Zorn were members of the X-Men. They were killed by Terrax during the Cabal&#x27;s attack on Earth-71202.

=== Powers of X ===
In one of the timelines experienced by Moira MacTaggert during the &quot;Powers of X&quot; storyline, Kuan-Yin Xorn becomes one of the final Horsemen of Apocalypse, representing Death. In this timeline he has become a dour nihilist whose powers have been reversed, sucking away life from creatures rather than restoring it, and his helmet is now a mostly-open mask from which blue flame spouts. This version of Kuan-Yin Xorn is responsible for ending his home timeline when the hybrid mutant Rasputin removes his mask, exposing the singularity at the centre of his brain. This final act is done at Xorn&#x27;s urging: &quot;&quot;this is the ending I have always wanted&quot;.&quot;

==In other media==
Xorn appears as a DLC skin for Magneto in &quot;&quot;.

<text>Beekeeping (or apiculture) is the maintenance of bee colonies, commonly in artificial beehives. Honey bees in the genus &quot;Apis&quot; are the most commonly kept species but other honey producing bees such as &quot;Melipona&quot; stingless bees are also kept. Beekeepers (or apiarists) keep bees to collect honey and other products of the hive: beeswax, propolis, bee pollen, and royal jelly. Other sources of beekeeping income include pollination of crops, raising queens, and production of package bees for sale. Bee hives are kept in an apiary or &quot;bee yard&quot;.

The earliest evidence of humans collecting honey are from Spanish caves paintings dated 6,000 BCE, however it is not until 3,100 BCE that there is evidence from Egypt of beekeeping being practiced.

In the modern era, beekeeping is often used for crop pollination and the collection of its by products, such as wax and propolis. The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses but many small beekeeping operations are run as a hobby. As beekeeping technology has advanced, beekeeping has become more accessible, and urban beekeeping was described as a growing trend as of 2016. Some studies have found city-kept bees are healthier than those in rural settings because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity in cities.

== History ==


=== Early history ===
At least 10,000 years ago, humans began to attempt to maintain colonies of wild bees in artificial hives made from hollow logs, wooden boxes, pottery vessels, and woven straw baskets known as skeps. Depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 10,000 years ago. Beekeeping in pottery vessels began about 9,000 years ago in North Africa. Traces of beeswax have been found in potsherds throughout the Middle East beginning about 7,000 BCE. Domestication of bees is shown in Egyptian art from around 4,500 years ago. Simple hives and smoke were used, and honey was stored in jars, some of which were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. In the 18th century, European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the movable comb hive so honey could be harvested without destroying the entire colony.

Honeybees were kept in Egypt from antiquity. On the walls of the sun temple of Nyuserre Ini from the Fifth Dynasty before 2,422 BCE, workers are depicted blowing smoke into hives as they remove honeycombs. Inscriptions detailing the production of honey are found on the tomb of Pabasa from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty , in which cylindrical hives are depicted along with people pouring honey into jars.

An inscription records the introduction of honey bees into the land of Suhum in Mesopotamia, where they were previously unknown:

The oldest archaeological finds directly relating to beekeeping have been discovered at Rehov, a Bronze and Iron Age archaeological site in the Jordan Valley, Israel. Thirty intact hives made of straw and unbaked clay were discovered in the ruins of the city, dating from about 900 BCE, by archaeologist Amihai Mazar. The hives were found in orderly rows, three high, in a manner that according to Mazar could have accommodated around 100 hives, held more than one million bees and had a potential annual yield of of honey and of beeswax, and are evidence an advanced honey industry in Tel Rehov, Israel 3,000 years ago.

In ancient Greece, in Crete and Mycenae, there existed a system of high-status apiculture that is evidenced by the finds of hives, smoking pots, honey extractors and other beekeeping paraphernalia in Knossos. Beekeeping was considered a highly valued industry controlled by beekeeping overseers—owners of gold rings depicting apiculture scenes rather than religious ones as they have been reinterpreted recently, contra Sir Arthur Evans.
Aspects of the lives of bees and beekeeping are discussed at length by Aristotle. Beekeeping was also documented by the Roman writers Virgil, Gaius Julius Hyginus, Varro, and Columella.

Beekeeping has been practiced in ancient China since antiquity. In a book written by Fan Li (or Tao Zhu Gong) during the Spring and Autumn period are sections describing beekeeping, stressing the importance of the quality of the wooden box used and its effects on the quality of the honey. The Chinese word for honey &quot;mi&quot; (), reconstructed Old Chinese pronunciation ) was borrowed from proto-Tocharian *&quot;ḿət(ə)&quot; (where *&quot;ḿ&quot; is palatalized; cf. Tocharian B &quot;mit&quot;), cognate with English &quot;&quot;.

The ancient Maya domesticated a species of stingless bee, which they used for several purposes, including making balché, a mead-like alcoholic drink. By 300 BCE they had achieved the highest levels of stingless beekeeping practices in the world. The use of stingless bees is referred to as meliponiculture, which is named after bees of the tribe Meliponini such as &quot;Melipona quadrifasciata&quot; in Brazil. This variation of beekeeping still occurs today. For instance, in Australia, the stingless bee &quot;Tetragonula carbonaria&quot; is kept for the production of honey.

=== Scientific study of honey bees ===

European natural philosophers began to scientifically study bee colonies in the 18th century. Eminent among these scientists were Swammerdam, René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, Charles Bonnet and François Huber. Swammerdam and Réaumur were among the first to use a microscope and dissection to understand the internal biology of honey bees. Réaumur was among the first to construct a glass-walled observation hive to better observe activities inside hives. He observed queens laying eggs in open cells but did not know how queens were fertilized; the mating of a queen and drone had not yet been observed and many theories held queens were &quot;self-fertile&quot; while others believed a vapor or &quot;miasma&quot; emanating from the drones fertilized queens without physical contact. Huber was the first to prove by observation and experiment that drones physically inseminate queens outside the confines of the hive, usually a great distance away.

Following Réaumur&#x27;s design, Huber built improved glass-walled observation hives and sectional hives that could be opened like the leaves of a book. This allowed the inspection of individual wax combs and greatly improved direct observation of hive activity. Although he went blind before he was twenty, Huber employed a secretary named François Burnens to make daily observations, conduct experiment and keep accurate notes for more than twenty years. Huber confirmed a hive consists of one queen, who is the mother of every female worker and male drone in the colony. He was also the first to confirm mating with drones takes place outside hives and that queens are inseminated in successive matings with male drones, which occur high in the air at a great distance from the hive. Together, Huber and Burnens dissected bees under the microscope, and were among the first to describe the ovaries and spermatheca (sperm store) of queens, as well as the penis of male drones. Huber is regarded as &quot;the father of modern bee-science&quot; and his work &quot;Nouvelles Observations sur Les Abeilles&quot; (New Observations on Bees) revealed all of the basic scientific facts of the biology and ecology of honeybees.

===Hive designs ===
Before the invention of the movable comb hive, the harvesting of honey frequently resulted in the destruction of the whole colony. The wild hive was broken into using smoke to quieten the bees. The honeycombs were pulled out and either immediately eaten whole or crushed, along with the eggs, larvae, and honey they held. A sieve or basket was used to separate the liquid honey from the demolished brood nest. In medieval times in northern Europe, although skeps and other containers were made to house bees, the honey and wax were still extracted after the bee colony was killed. This was usually accomplished by using burning sulfur to suffocate the colony without harming the honey within. It was impossible to replace old, dark-brown brood comb in which larval bees are constricted by layers of shed pupal skins.

The movable frames of modern hives are considered to have been developed from the traditional basket top bar (movable comb) hives of Greece, which allowed the beekeeper to avoid killing the bees. The oldest evidence of their use dates to 1669, although it is probable their use is more than 3,000 years old.

Intermediate stages in the transition from older methods of beekeeping were recorded in 1768 by Thomas Wildman, who described advances over the destructive, skep-based method so bees no longer had to be killed to harvest their honey. Wildman fixed an array of parallel wooden bars across the top of a straw hive in diameter &quot;so that there are in all seven bars of deal to which the bees fix their combs&quot;, foreshadowing future uses of movable-comb hives. He also described using such hives in a multi-story configuration, foreshadowing the modern use of supers: he added successive straw hives below and later removed the ones above when free of brood and filled with honey so the bees could be separately preserved at the harvest the following season. Wildman also described the use of hives with &quot;sliding frames&quot; in which the bees would build their comb.

Wildman&#x27;s book acknowledges the advances in knowledge of bees made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de Réaumur—he includes a lengthy translation of Réaumur&#x27;s account of the natural history of bees. Wildman also describes the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bees when taking the harvest, citing reports from Brittany in the 1750s due to the Comte de la Bourdonnaye. Another hive design was invented by Rev. John Thorley in 1744; the hive was placed in a bell jar that was screwed onto a wicker basket. The bees were free to move from the basket to the jar, and honey was produced and stored in the jar. The hive was designed to keep the bees from swarming as much as they would have in other hive designs.

In the 19th century, changes in beekeeping practice were completed through the development of the movable comb hive by the American Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth, who was the first person to make practical use of Huber&#x27;s earlier discovery of a specific spatial distance between the wax combs, later called &quot;the bee space&quot;, which bees do not block with wax but keep as a free passage. Having determined this bee space, which is commonly given as between , though up to has been found in populations in Ethiopia. Langstroth then designed a series of wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, carefully maintaining the correct space between successive frames. He found the bees would build parallel honeycombs in the box without bonding them to each other or to the hive walls. This enables the beekeeper to slide any frame out of the hive for inspection without harming the bees or the comb; and protecting the eggs, larvae and pupae in the cells. It also meant combs containing honey could be gently removed and the honey extracted without destroying the comb. The emptied honeycombs could then be returned intact to the bees for refilling. Langstroth&#x27;s book &quot;The Hive and Honey-bee&quot; (1853), describes his rediscovery of the bee space and the development of his patent movable comb hive. The invention and development of the movable comb hive enabled the growth of large-scale, commercial honey production in both Europe and the U.S.

=== 20th and 21st century hive designs ===

Langstroth&#x27;s design of movable comb hives was adopted by apiarists and inventors in both North America and Europe, and a wide range of moveable comb hives were developed in England, France, Germany and the United States. Classic designs evolved in each country; Dadant hives and Langstroth hives are still dominant in the U.S.; in France the De-Layens trough hive became popular, in the UK a British National hive became standard by the 1930s, although in Scotland the smaller Smith hive is still popular. In some Scandinavian countries and in Russia, the traditional trough hive persisted until late in the 20th century and is still kept in some areas. The Langstroth and Dadant designs, however, remain ubiquitous in the U.S. and in many parts of Europe, though Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy all have their own national hive designs. Regional variations of hive were developed according to climate, floral productivity and reproductive characteristics of the subspecies of native honey bees in each bio-region.

The differences in hive dimensions are insignificant in comparison to the common factors in these hives: they are all square or rectangular; they all use movable wooden frames; and they all consist of a floor, brood-box, honey super, crown-board and roof. Hives have traditionally been constructed from cedar, pine or cypress wood but in recent years, hives made from injection-molded, dense polystyrene have become increasingly common. Hives also use queen excluders between the brood-box and honey supers to keep the queen from laying eggs in cells next to those containing honey intended for consumption. With the 20th-century advent of mite pests, hive floors are often replaced, either temporarily or permanently, with a wire mesh and a removable tray.

In 2015, the Flow Hive system was invented in Australia by Cedar Anderson and his father Stuart Anderson, whose design allows honey to be extracted without cumbersome centrifuge equipment.

=== Pioneers of practical and commercial beekeeping ===
In the 19th century, improvements were made in the design and production of beehives, systems of management and husbandry, stock improvement by selective breeding, honey extraction and marketing. Notable innovators of modern beekeeping include:

Petro Prokopovych used frames with channels in the side of the woodwork; these were packed side-by-side in stacked boxes. Bees traveled between frames and boxes via these channels, which were similar to the cutouts in the sides of modern wooden sections.

Jan Dzierżon&#x27; beehive design has influenced modern beehives.

François Huber made significant discoveries about the bee life cycle and communication between bees. Despite being blind, Huber discovered a large amount of information about the queen bee&#x27;s mating habits and her contact with the rest of the hive. His work was published as &quot;New Observations on the Natural History of Bees&quot;.

L. L. Langstroth has influenced modern beekeeping practice more than anyone else. His book &quot;The Hive and Honey-bee&quot; was published in 1853.

Moses Quinby, author of &quot;Mysteries of Bee-Keeping Explained&quot;, invented the bee smoker in 1873.

Amos Root, author of the &quot;A B C of Bee Culture&quot;, which has been continuously revised and remains in print, pioneered the manufacture of hives and the distribution of bee packages in the United States.

A. J. Cook author of &quot;The Bee-Keepers&#x27; Guide; or Manual of the Apiary&quot;, 1876.

Dr. C.C. Miller was one of the first entrepreneurs to make a living from apiculture. By 1878, he made beekeeping his sole business activity. His book, &quot;Fifty Years Among the Bees&quot;, remains a classic and his influence on bee management persists into the 21st century.

Franz Hruschka was an Austrian/Italian military officer who in 1865 invented a simple machine for extracting honey from the comb by means of centrifugal force. His original idea was to support combs in a metal framework and then spin them within a container to collect honey that was thrown out by centrifugal force. This meant honeycombs could be returned to a hive empty and undamaged, saving the bees a vast amount of work, time and materials. This invention significantly improved the efficiency of honey harvesting and catalyzed the modern honey industry.

Walter T. Kelley was an American pioneer of modern beekeeping in the early-and mid-20th century. He greatly improved upon beekeeping equipment and clothing, and went on to manufacture these items and other equipment. His company sold products worldwide and his book &quot;How to Keep Bees &amp; Sell Honey&quot;, encouraged a boom in beekeeping following World War II.

Cary W. Hartman (1859–1947), lecturer, well known beekeeping enthusiast and honey promoter was elected President of the California State Beekeepers&#x27; Association in 1921.

In the UK, practical beekeeping was led in the early 20th century by a few men, pre-eminently Brother Adam and his Buckfast bee, and R.O.B. Manley, author of books including &quot;Honey Production in the British Isles&quot; and inventor of the Manley frame, which is still universally popular in the UK. Other notable British pioneers include William Herrod-Hempsall and Gale.

Ahmed Zaky Abushady (1892–1955) was an Egyptian poet, medical doctor, bacteriologist, and bee scientist, who was active in England and Egypt in the early twentieth century. In 1919, Abushady patented a removable, standardized aluminum honeycomb. In the same year, he founded The Apis Club in Benson, Oxfordshire, which later became the International Bee Research Association (IBRA). In Egypt in the 1930s, Abushady established The Bee Kingdom League and its organ &quot;The Bee Kingdom&quot;.

== Hives and other equipment==
=== Horizontal hives ===

A Horizontal top-bar hive is a single-story, frameless beehive in which the comb hangs from removable bars that form a continuous roof over the comb, whereas the frames in most current hives allow space for bees to move between boxes. Hives that have frames or that use honey chambers in summer and use management principles similar to those of regular top-bar hives are sometimes also referred to as top-bar hives. Top-bar hives are rectangular and are typically more than twice as wide as multi-story framed hives commonly found in English-speaking countries. Top-bar hives usually include one box and allow for beekeeping methods that interfere very little with the colony. While conventional advice often recommends inspecting each colony each week during the warmer months, some beekeepers fully inspect top-bar hives only once a year, and only one comb needs to be lifted at a time.

=== Vertical stackable hives ===
There are three types of vertical stackable hives: hanging or top-access frame, sliding or side-access frame, and top bar.

Hanging-frame hive designs include Langstroth, the British National, Dadant, Layens, and Rose, which differ in size and number of frames. The Langstroth was the first successful top-opened hive with movable frames. Many other hive designs are based on the principle of bee space that was first described by Langstroth, and is a descendant of Jan Dzierzon&#x27;s Polish hive designs. Langstroth hives are the most-common size in the United States and much of the world; the British National is the most common size in the United Kingdom; Dadant and Modified Dadant hives are widely used in France and Italy, and Layens by some beekeepers, where their large size is an advantage. Square Dadant hives–often called 12-frame Dadant or Brother Adam hives–are used in large parts of Germany and other parts of Europe by commercial beekeepers.

Any hanging-frame hive design can be built as a sliding frame design. The AZ Hive, the original sliding frame design, integrates hives using Langstroth-sized frames into a honey house to streamline the workflow of honey harvest by localization of labor, similar to cellular manufacturing. The honey house can be a portable trailer, allowing the beekeeper to move hives to a site and provide pollination services.

Top-bar stackable hives use top bars instead of full frames. The most common type is the Warre hive, although any hive with hanging frames can be converted into a top-bar stackable hive by using only the top bar rather than the whole frame. This may work less well with larger frames, where crosscomb and attachment can occur more readily.

=== Protective clothing ===
Most beekeepers wear some protective clothing. Novice beekeepers usually wear gloves and a hooded suit or hat and veil. Experienced beekeepers sometimes choose not to use gloves because they inhibit delicate manipulations. The face and neck are the most important areas to protect, so most beekeepers wear at least a veil. Defensive bees are attracted to the breath; a sting on the face can lead to much more pain and swelling than a sting elsewhere, while a sting on a bare hand can usually be quickly removed by fingernail scrape to reduce the amount of venom injected.

Traditionally, beekeeping clothing is pale-colored because of the natural color of cotton and the cost of coloring is an expense not warranted for workwear, though some consider this to provide better differentiation from the colony&#x27;s natural predators such as bears and skunks, which tend to be dark-colored. It is now known bees see in ultraviolet wavelengths and are also attracted to scent. The type of fabric conditioner used has more impact than the color of the fabric.

Stings that are retained in clothing fabric continue to pump out an alarm pheromone that attracts aggressive action and further stinging attacks. Attraction can be minimized with regular washing.

=== Smoker ===

Most beekeepers use a smoker, a device that generates smoke from the incomplete combustion of fuels. Although the exact mechanism is disputed, it is said smoke calms bees. Some claim it initiates a feeding response in anticipation of possible hive abandonment due to fire. It is also thought smoke masks alarm pheromones released by guard bees or bees that are squashed in an inspection. The ensuing confusion creates an opportunity for the beekeeper to open the hive and work without triggering a defensive reaction.

Many types of fuel can be used in a smoker as long as it is natural and not contaminated with harmful substances. Common fuels include hessian, twine, pine needles, corrugated cardboard, and rotten or punky wood. Indian beekeepers, especially in Kerala, often use coconut fibers, which are readily available, safe, and cheap. Some beekeeping supply sources also sell commercial fuels like pulped paper, compressed cotton and aerosol cans of smoke. Other beekeepers use sumac as fuel because it ejects much smoke and lacks an odor.

Some beekeepers use &quot;liquid smoke&quot; as a safer, more convenient alternative. It is a water-based solution that is sprayed onto the bees from a plastic spray bottle. A spray of clean water can also be used to encourage bees to move on. Torpor may also be induced by the introduction of chilled air into the hive, while chilled carbon dioxide may have harmful, long-term effects.

Few anecdotal stories of using the smoke from burning fungi in England or Europe for centuries have been published. Several more recent studies describe anaesthesia of honeybees use of smoke from burning fungi. The fungi reported to have been used to smoke bees are the puffballs Lycoperdon gigantium, L. wahlbergii and the conks, Fomes fomentarius and F. igiarius. When fungi are burned, the characteristic smell is due to the pyrolysis of the keratin cell wall of fungi. Besides being a major fungi constituent, keratin is found in animal tissues, such as hair or feathers. Anaesthesia experiments done using smoke from pyrolysis of L. wahlbergii, human hair and chicken feathers showed no difference in long-term mortality of anesthetized honeybees and non-treated bees in the same hive. Hydrogen sulphide was identified as the major combustion product that is responsible for putting the bees to sleep. Note – hydrogen sulphide is toxic to humans at high concentrations.

=== Hive tool ===
Most beekeepers use a hive tool when working on their hives. The two main types are the American hive tool; and the Australian hive tool often called a &#x27;frame lifter&#x27;. They are used to scrape off burr-comb from around the hive, especially on top of the frames. They are also used to separate the frames before lifting out of the hive.

==Safety and husbandry==
=== Stings===
Some beekeepers believe pain and irritation from stings decreases if a beekeeper receives more stings, and they consider it important for safety of the beekeeper to be stung a few times a season. Beekeepers have high levels of antibodies, mainly Immunoglobulin G, caused by a reaction to the major antigen of bee venom, phospholipase A2 (PLA). Antibodies correlate with the frequency of bee stings.

The entry of venom into the body from bee stings may be hindered and reduced by protective clothing that allows the wearer to remove stings and venom sacs with a simple tug on the clothing. Although the stinger is barbed, a worker bee&#x27;s stinger is less likely to become lodged into clothing than human skin.

Symptoms of being stung include redness, swelling and itching around the site of the sting. In mild cases, pain and swelling subside in two hours. In moderate cases, the red welt at the sting site will become slightly larger for one or two days before beginning to heal. A severe reaction, which is rare among beekeepers, results in anaphylactic shock.

If a beekeeper is stung by a bee, the sting should be removed without squeezing the attached venom glands. A quick scrape with a fingernail is effective and intuitive, and ensures the venom injected does not spread so the side effects of the sting will go away sooner. Washing the affected area with soap and water can also stop the spread of venom. Ice or a cold compress can be applied to the sting area.

===Internal temperature of a hive===
Bees maintain the internal temperature of their hive at about . Their ability to do this is known as social homeostasis and was first described by Gates in 1914. During hot weather, bees cool the hive by circulating cool air from the entrance through the hive and out again; and if necessary by placing water, which they fetch, throughout the hive to create evaporative cooling. In cold weather, packing and insulation of the bee hive is believed to be beneficial. The extra insulation is believed to reduce the amount of honey the bees consume and makes it easier for them to maintain the hive&#x27;s temperature. The desire for insulation encouraged the use of double-walled hives with an outer wall of timber or polystyrene; and hives constructed from a ceramic.

===Location of hives===
There has been considerable debate about the best location for hives. Virgil thought they should be located near clear springs, ponds or shallow brooks. Wildman thought they should face to the south or west. All writers agree hives should be sheltered from strong winds. In hot climates, hives are often placed under the shade of trees in summer. Researchers in the U.S. found domestic honey bees placed in national parks compete with native bee species for resources. A further review of the literature concluded large concentrations of beehives on continents where they are not native, such as North and South America, could compete against the native bees; this, however, was not as strongly observed in areas where domestic bees are native such as Europe and Africa, where the different bee species have adapted to have a narrower overlapping of forage preferences.

=== Natural beekeeping ===

The natural beekeeping movement believes bee hives are weakened by modern beekeeping and agricultural practices, such as crop spraying, hive movement, frequent hive inspections, artificial insemination of queens, routine medication, and sugar water feeding. Practitioners of &quot;natural beekeeping&quot; tend to use variations of the top-bar hive, which is a simple design that retains the concept of having a movable comb without the use of frames or a foundation. The horizontal top-bar hive, as promoted by many writers, can be seen as a modernization of hollow log hives, with the addition of wooden bars of specific width from which bees hang their combs. The widespread adoption of Natural Beekeeping methods in recent years can be attributed to the 2007 publications of &quot;Natural Beekeeping&quot; by Ross Conrad, and &quot;The Barefoot Beekeeper&quot; by Philip Chandler, which challenges many aspects of modern beekeeping and offers the horizontal top-bar hive as a viable alternative to the ubiquitous Langstroth-style movable-frame hive.

A vertical top-bar hive is the Warré hive, based on a design by the French priest Abbé Émile Warré (1867–1951) and popularized by David Heaf in his English translation of Warré&#x27;s book &quot;L&#x27;Apiculture pour Tous&quot; as &quot;Beekeeping For All&quot;.

=== Urban and backyard beekeeping ===

Related to natural beekeeping, urban beekeeping is an attempt to revert to a less-industrialized way of obtaining honey by using small-scale colonies that pollinate urban gardens. Some have found city bees are healthier than rural bees because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity in urban gardens. Urban bees may fail to find forage, however, and homeowners can use their land to help feed local bee populations by planting flowers that provide nectar and pollen. An environment of year-round, uninterrupted bloom creates an ideal environment for colony reproduction.

Using managed honeybee colonies to fill the ecological niche of pollinators in urban environments is also thought to be crucial to preventing the formation of feral colonies by more destructive species like the Africanized honeybee (AHB).

=== Indoor beekeeping ===
Modern beekeepers have experimented with raising bees indoors in a controlled environment or in indoor observation hives. This may be done for reasons of space and monitoring, or in the cooler months, when large commercial beekeepers may move colonies to &quot;wintering&quot; warehouses with fixed temperature, light, and humidity. This helps bees remain healthy but relatively dormant. These relatively dormant &quot;wintered&quot; bees survive on stored honey, and new bees are not born.

Experiments in raising bees indoors for longer durations have looked into more precise and varying environment controls. In 2015, MIT&#x27;s &quot;Synthetic Apiary&quot; project simulated springtime inside a closed environment for several hives throughout the winter. They provided food sources and simulated long days, and saw activity and reproduction levels comparable to the levels seen outdoors in warm weather. They concluded such an indoor apiary could be sustained year-round if needed.

== Behavior of honey bees==
=== Colony reproduction===

Honey bee colonies are dependent on their queen, who is the only egg-layer. Although queens have a three-to-four-year adult lifespan, diminished longevity of queens—less than a year—is commonly and increasingly observed. The queen can choose whether to fertilize an egg as she lays it; fertilized eggs develop into a female worker bees and unfertilized eggs become male drones. The queen&#x27;s choice of egg type depends on the size of the open brood cell she encounters on the comb. In a small worker cell, she lays a fertilized egg; she lays unfertilized drone eggs in larger drone cells.

When the queen is fertile and laying eggs, she produces a variety of pheromones that control the behavior of the bees in the hive; these are commonly called queen substance. Each pheromone has a different function. As the queen ages, she begins to run out of stored sperm and her pheromones begin to fail.

As the queen&#x27;s pheromones fail, the bees replace her by creating a new queen from one of her worker eggs. They may do this because she has been physically injured, because she has run out of sperm and cannot lay fertilized eggs, and has become a drone-laying queen, or because her pheromones have dwindled to the point at which they cannot control all of the bees in the hive. At this juncture, the bees produce one or more queen cells by modifying existing worker cells that contain a normal female egg. They then either supersede the queen without swarming or divide the hive into two colonies through swarm-cell production, which leads to swarming.

Supersedure is a valued behavioral trait because hive that supersedes its old queen does not lose any stock; rather it creates a new queen and the old one either naturally dies or is killed when the new queen emerges. In these hives, bees produce only one or two queen cells, most often in the center of the face of a broodcomb. Swarm-cell production involves the creation of twelve or more queen cells. These are large, peanut-shaped protrusions requiring space, for which reason they are often located around the edges—commonly at the sides and the bottom—of the broodcomb.

Once either process has begun, the old queen leaves the hive when the first queen cells hatch, and is accompanied by a large number of bees—predominantly young bees called wax-secretors—which form the basis of the new hive. Scouts are sent from the swarm to find suitable hollow trees or rock crevices; when one is found, the entire swarm moves in. Within hours, the new colony&#x27;s bees build new wax brood combs using honey stores with which the young bees have filled themselves before leaving the old hive. Only young bees can secrete wax from special abdominal segments, which is why swarms tend to contain more young bees. Often a number of virgin queens accompany the first swarm, known as the &quot;prime swarm&quot;, and the old queen is replaced as soon as a daughter queen mates and begins laying. Otherwise, she is quickly superseded in the new hive.

Different sub-species of &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; exhibit differing swarming characteristics. In North America, northern black races are thought to swarm less and supersede more whereas the southern yellow-and-gray varieties are said to swarm more frequently. Swarming behavior is complicated because of the prevalence of cross-breeding and hybridization of the sub-species. Italian bees are very prolific and inclined to swarm; Northern European black bees have a strong tendency to supersede their old queen without swarming. These differences are the result of differing evolutionary pressures in the regions in which each sub-species evolved.

=== Factors that trigger swarming ===
According to George S. Demuth, the main factors that increase the swarming tendency of bees are:
* The genetics of bees; the strength of the swarming instinct
* Congestion of the brood nest 
* Insufficient empty combs for ripening nectar and storing honey 
* Inadequate ventilation 
* Having an old queen 
* Warming weather conditions.

Demuth attributed some of his comments to Snelgrove.

Some beekeepers carefully monitor their colonies in spring for the appearance of queen cells, which are a dramatic signal the colony is determined to swarm. After leaving the old hive, the swarm looks for shelter. A beekeeper may capture it and introduce it into a new hive. Otherwise, the swarm reverts to a feral state and finds shelter in a hollow tree or other suitable habitat. A small after-swarm has less chance of survival and may threaten the original hive&#x27;s survival if the number of remaining bees is unsustainable. When a hive swarms despite the beekeeper&#x27;s preventative efforts, the beekeeper may give the reduced hive two frames of open brood with eggs. This helps replenish the hive more quickly and gives a second opportunity to raise a queen if there is a mating failure.

=== Artificial swarming ===
When a colony accidentally loses its queen, it is said to be queenless. The workers realize the queen is absent after around an hour as her pheromones in the hive fade. Instinctively, the workers select cells containing eggs aged less than three days and dramatically enlarge the cells to form &quot;emergency queen cells&quot;. These appear similar to large, -long, peanut-like structures that hang from the center or side of the brood combs. The developing larva in a queen cell is fed differently than an ordinary worker bee; in addition to honey and pollen, she receives a great deal of royal jelly, a special food secreted from the hypopharyngeal gland of young nurse bees. Royal jelly dramatically alters the growth and development of the larva so after metamorphosis and pupation, it emerges from the cell as a queen bee. The queen is the only bee in a colony that has fully developed ovaries; she secretes a pheromone that suppresses the normal development of ovaries in all of her workers.

Beekeepers use the ability of the bees to produce new queens to increase their colonies in a procedure called &quot;splitting a colony&quot;. To do this, they remove several brood combs from a healthy hive, leaving the old queen behind. These combs must contain eggs or larvae less than three days old and be covered by young nurse bees, which care for the brood and keep it warm. These brood combs and nurse bees are then placed into a small &quot;nucleus hive&quot; with other combs containing honey and pollen. As soon as the nurse bees find themselves in this new hive, and realize they have no queen and begin constructing emergency queen cells using the eggs and larvae in the combs.

== Pests and diseases==
=== Diseases ===

The common agents of disease that affect adult honey bees include fungi, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, parasites and poisons. The gross symptoms displayed by affected adult bees are very similar, whatever the cause, making it difficult to ascertain the causes without microscopic identification of microorganisms or chemical analysis of poisons. Since 2006, colony losses from colony collapse disorder (CCD) have been increasing across the world, although the causes of the syndrome are unknown. In the U.S., commercial beekeepers have been increasing the number of hives to deal with higher rates of attrition.

=== Parasites ===
&quot;Nosema apis&quot; is a &quot;microsporidian&quot; that causes nosemosis, also called nosema, the most-common and widespread disease of the adult honey bee.

&quot;Galleria mellonella&quot; and &quot;Achroia grisella&quot; wax moth larvae hatch, tunnel through and destroy comb that contains bee larvae and their honey stores. The tunnels they create are lined with silk, which entangles and starves emerging bees. Destruction of honeycombs also results in leakage and wasting of honey. A healthy hive can manage wax moths but weak colonies, unoccupied hives and stored frames can be decimated.

Small hive beetle (&quot;Aethina tumida&quot;) is native to Africa but has now spread to most continents. It is a serious pest among honey bees unadapted to it.

&quot;Varroa destructor&quot;, the Varroa mite, is an established pest of two species of honey bee through many parts of the world and is blamed by many researchers as a leading cause of CCD.

&quot;Tropilaelaps&quot; mites, of which there are four species, are native to &quot;Apis dorsata&quot;, &quot;Apis laboriosa&quot;, and &quot;Apis breviligula&quot;, but spread to &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; after they were introduced to Asia.

&quot;Acarapis woodi&quot;, the tracheal mite, infests the trachea of honey bees.

=== Predators ===
Most predators prefer not to eat honeybees due to their unpleasant sting. Common honeybee predators include large animals such as skunks and bears, which seek the hive&#x27;s honey and brood, as well as adult bees. Some birds will also eat bees, (for example, bee-eaters, as do some robber flies, such as &quot;Mallophora ruficauda&quot;, which is a pest of apiculture in South America due to its habit of eating workers while they are foraging in meadows.

=== Decreasing lifespan ===
A 2022 study by researchers at University of Maryland, College Park observed lifespan of caged worker bees is half as long as that observed 50 years ago, and hypothesized decreased worker-bee lifespans should correlate to decreased honey production.

== Recent developments ==

=== World Beekeeping Awards 2024 ===
The World Beekeeping Awards, held in December 2024, showcased the global importance of apiculture and honey production. The event, which took place in London, United Kingdom, featured entries from over 50 countries and highlighted the diverse range of honey varieties produced worldwide. 

=== Honey fraud scandal ===
However, the 2024 World Beekeeping Awards were marred by a significant scandal involving honey fraud. Investigators uncovered a sophisticated operation where some contestants had submitted adulterated honey samples.

The fraudulent entries contained:

* Honey diluted with sugar syrup
* Mislabeled honey varieties
* Honey from undisclosed geographical origins

This incident has raised concerns about the integrity of honey production and labeling practices in the global market. As a result, the World Beekeeping Association has announced plans to implement more rigorous testing procedures for future competitions.

=== Industry response ===
In response to the fraud scandal, several measures have been proposed to enhance honey authenticity and protect consumers:

# Advanced testing methods: Implementation of more sophisticated laboratory techniques to detect adulteration.
# Blockchain technology: Exploration of blockchain-based traceability systems to track honey from hive to shelf.
# Stricter regulations: Calls for more stringent international standards and enforcement of honey labeling and production practices.

These developments highlight the ongoing challenges faced by the beekeeping industry in maintaining product integrity and consumer trust in an increasingly global market. 

== World apiculture ==
According to Food and Agriculture Organization data, the world&#x27;s beehive stock rose from around 50 million in 1961 to around 83 million in 2014, which represents an annual average growth of 1.3%. Average annual growth has accelerated to 1.9% since 2009.

<text>HMS &quot;Lydiard&quot; was a built for the Royal Navy during the 1910s.

==Description==
The &quot;Laforey&quot; class were improved and faster versions of the preceding . They displaced . The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . &quot;Lydiard&quot; was powered by two Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four Yarrow boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 74 officers and ratings.

The ships were armed with three single QF Mark IV guns and two QF 1.5-pounder (37 mm) anti-aircraft guns. These latter guns were later replaced by a pair of QF 2-pounder (40 mm) &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns. The ships were also fitted with two above-water twin mounts for torpedoes.

==Construction and service==
The ship was ordered as &quot;Waverley&quot; from Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company as part of the 1912–13 programme, but was renamed &quot;Lydiard&quot; before being launched on 26 February 1914. She served with the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, and fought at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914, where she was credited with torpedoing the German light cruiser .

&quot;Lydiard&quot; also took part in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, where she formed part of the 9th Destroyer Flotilla, along with her sister ships , and , supporting Admiral Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. She was transferred to escort duties after 1917, and sold for breaking in November 1921.

<text>Friedrich Hermann Hund (4 February 1896 – 31 March 1997) was a German physicist from Karlsruhe known for his work on atoms and molecules. He is known for the Hund&#x27;s rules to predict the electron configuration of chemical elements. His work on Hund&#x27;s cases and molecular orbital theory allowed to understand the structure of molecules.

==Scientific career==
Hund worked with such prestigious physicists as Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Walther Bothe. At that time, he was Born&#x27;s assistant, working with quantum interpretation of band spectra of diatomic molecules.
After his studies of mathematics, physics, and geography in Marburg and Göttingen, he worked as a private lecturer for theoretical physics in the University of Göttingen (1925), professor in the University of Rostock (1927), Leipzig University (1929), University of Jena (1946), University Frankfurt (1951) and from 1957 again in Göttingen. Additionally, he stayed in Copenhagen (1926) with Niels Bohr and lectured on the atom at Harvard University (1928). He published more than 250 papers and essays in total. Hund made pivotal contributions to quantum theory - especially concerning the structure of the atom and of molecular spectra.

In fact, Robert S. Mulliken, who was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for molecular orbital theory, always proclaimed the great influence Hund&#x27;s work had on his own and that he would have gladly shared the Nobel Prize with Hund. In recognition of the importance of Hund&#x27;s contributions, molecular orbital theory is often referred to as the Hund–Mulliken MO theory. Hund&#x27;s rule of maximum multiplicity is another eponym and, in 1926, Hund discovered the so-called tunnel effect or quantum tunnelling.

The Hund&#x27;s cases, which are particular regimes in diatomic molecular angular momentum coupling, and Hund&#x27;s rules, which govern atomic electron configurations, are important in spectroscopy and quantum chemistry. In chemistry, the first rule, Hund&#x27;s rule of maximum multiplicity, is especially important and is often referred to as simply Hund&#x27;s Rule.

== Personal life ==

Hund married mathematician Ingeborg Seynsche (1905–1994) in Barmen on 17 March 1931. The family had six children: chess player and mathematician Gerhard Hund (1932–2024), Dietrich (1933–1939), Irmgard (b. 1934), Martin (1937–2018), Andreas (b. 1940) and Erwin (1941–2022). The chess woman grandmaster Barbara Hund (b. 1959) and chess player Isabel Hund (b. 1962) are his granddaughters.

Hund is buried in Munich Waldfriedhof. 

== Honours ==

Hund was a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science. He was awarded the Max Planck Medal in 1943.

==Legacy==
On the occasion of his 100th birthday, the book: Friedrich Hund: Geschichte der physikalischen Begriffe [History of Physical Concepts] (Heidelberg, Berlin, Oxford), Spektrum, Akademie Verlag 1996, was published. A review was also written by Werner Kutzelnigg.
Friedrich Hund&#x27;s work and interest in the history of science was also discussed intensely in an interview conducted by Klaus Hentschel and Renate Tobies.
In addition to the many honors bestowed upon him, Friedrich Hund became an honorary citizen of Jena/Saale, and a street in Jena was named after him. In June 2004, a part of a new building of the Physics Department in Göttingen was given the address Friedrich-Hund-Platz 1. The same name was chosen for the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Göttingen.

<doc id="322105" wikidata="Q170662" url="?curid=322105" title="Mangosteen">
<text>Mangosteen (&quot;Garcinia mangostana&quot;), also known as the purple mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree with edible fruit native to Island Southeast Asia, from the Malay Peninsula to Borneo. It has been cultivated extensively in tropical Asia since ancient times. It is grown mainly in Southeast Asia, southwest India and other tropical areas such as Colombia, Puerto Rico and Florida, where the tree has been introduced. The tree grows from tall.

The fruit of the mangosteen is sweet and tangy, juicy, somewhat fibrous, with fluid-filled vesicles (like the flesh of citrus fruits), with an inedible, deep reddish-purple colored rind (exocarp) when ripe. In each fruit, the fragrant edible flesh that surrounds each seed is botanically endocarp, i.e., the inner layer of the ovary. The seeds are of similar size and shape to almonds.

Genus &quot;Garcinia&quot; also contains several less-known fruit-bearing species, such as the button mangosteen (&quot;G. prainiana&quot;) and the charichuelo (&quot;G. madruno&quot;).

== Description ==
=== Tree ===
A tropical tree, the mangosteen must be grown in consistently warm conditions, as exposure to temperatures below for prolonged periods will usually kill a mature plant. They are known to recover from brief cold spells rather well, often with damage only to young growth. Experienced horticulturists have grown this species outdoors, and brought them to fruit in extreme south Florida.

The tree grows from tall.

=== Fruit ===
The juvenile mangosteen fruit, which does not require fertilisation to form (see agamospermy), first appears as pale green or almost white in the shade of the canopy. As the fruit enlarges over the next two to three months, the exocarp colour deepens to darker green. During this period, the fruit increases in size until its exocarp is in outside diameter, remaining hard until a final, abrupt ripening stage.

The subsurface chemistry of the mangosteen exocarp comprises an array of polyphenols, including xanthones and tannins that assure astringency which discourages infestation by insects, fungi, plant viruses, bacteria, and animal predation while the fruit is immature. Colour changes and softening of the exocarp are natural processes of ripening that indicate the fruit can be eaten and the seeds have finished developing.

Once the developing mangosteen fruit has stopped expanding, chlorophyll synthesis slows as the next colour phase begins. Initially streaked with red, the exocarp pigmentation transitions from green to red to dark purple, indicating a final ripening stage. This entire process takes place over a period of ten days as the edible quality of the fruit peaks. Over the days following removal from the tree, the exocarp hardens to an extent depending upon post-harvest handling and storage conditions, especially relative humidity levels. If the ambient humidity is high, exocarp hardening may take a week or longer when the flesh quality is peaking and excellent for consumption. However, after several additional days of storage, especially if unrefrigerated, the flesh inside the fruit might spoil without any obvious external indications. Using the hardness of the rind as an indicator of freshness for the first two weeks following harvest is therefore unreliable because the rind does not accurately reveal the interior condition of the flesh. If the exocarp is soft and yielding as it is when ripe and fresh from the tree, the fruit is usually good.

The edible endocarp of the mangosteen has the same shape and size as a tangerine in diameter, but is white. The number of fruit segments corresponds exactly with the number of stigma lobes on the exterior apex; accordingly, a higher number of fleshy segments also corresponds with the fewest seeds. The circle of wedge-shaped segments contains 4–8, rarely 9 segments, the larger ones harbouring the apomictic seeds that are unpalatable unless roasted. As a non-climacteric fruit, picked mangosteen does not ripen further, so it must be consumed shortly after harvest.

Often described as a subtle delicacy, the flesh bears an exceptionally mild aroma, quantitatively having about 1/400th of the chemical constituents of fragrant fruits, explaining its relative mildness. The main volatile components having caramel, grass and butter notes as part of the mangosteen fragrance are hexyl acetate, hexenol and α-copaene. Ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate and 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol were detected as aroma components in mangosteen wine.

==Origins and history==
Cultivated mangosteen (&quot;Garcinia mangostana&quot; var. &quot;mangostana&quot;) is dioecious, but male trees are unknown. The trees produce viable seeds via apomixis, where all the embryos are essentially clones of the mother. Its extensive cultivation has made its original native range difficult to ascertain. &quot;Garcinia mangostana&quot; var. &quot;mangostana&quot; is likely to be the domesticated descendant of wild populations of &quot;Garcinia mangostana&quot; var. &quot;malaccensis&quot; (previously thought to be a separate species) and &quot;Garcinia mangostana&quot; var. &quot;borneensis&quot;, native to the Malay Peninsula and Borneo respectively. Both of these wild varieties still possess male trees, unlike the domesticated mangosteen. It may have also hybridized to a limited extent with closely-related species, including &quot;Garcinia penangiana&quot; and &quot;Garcinia venulosa&quot;.

Mangosteen is highly valued for its juicy, delicate texture and slightly sweet and sour flavor, the mangosteen has been cultivated in Malaysia, Sri Lanka,Borneo, Sumatra, Mainland Southeast Asia, and the Philippines since ancient times. The 15th-century Chinese record Yingya Shenglan described mangosteen as &quot;mang-chi-shih&quot; (derived from Malay &quot;manggis&quot;), a native plant of Southeast Asia of white flesh with a delectable sweet and sour taste.

A description of mangosteen was included in the &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; by Linnaeus in 1753. The mangosteen was introduced into English greenhouses in 1855. Subsequently, its culture was introduced into the Western Hemisphere, where it became established in West Indies islands, especially Jamaica. It was later established on the Americas mainland in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Ecuador. The mangosteen tree generally does not grow well outside the tropics.

In Southeast Asia, mangosteen is commonly known as the &quot;Queen of Fruits&quot;, and is frequently paired with durian, the &quot;King of Fruits&quot;. In Chinese food therapy, mangosteen is considered &quot;cooling&quot;, making it a good counterbalance to the &quot;heaty&quot; durian. There is also a legend about Queen Victoria offering a reward of one hundred pounds sterling to anyone who could deliver a fresh mangosteen to her. Although this legend can be traced to a 1930 publication by the fruit explorer David Fairchild, it is not substantiated by any known historical document.

The journalist and gourmet R. W. Apple Jr. once said of the fruit, &quot;No other fruit, for me, is so thrillingly, intoxicatingly luscious...I&#x27;d rather eat one than a hot fudge sundae, which for a big Ohio boy is saying a lot.&quot; Since 2006, private small-volume orders for fruits grown in Puerto Rico were sold to American specialty food stores and gourmet restaurants who serve the flesh segments as a delicacy dessert.

==Propagation, cultivation and harvest==
Mangosteen is usually propagated by seedlings. Vegetative propagation is difficult and seedlings are more robust and reach fruiting earlier than vegetatively propagated plants.

Mangosteen produces a recalcitrant seed which is not a true seed strictly defined, but rather described as a nucellar asexual embryo. As seed formation involves no sexual fertilization, the seedling is genetically identical to the mother plant. If allowed to dry, a seed dies quickly, but if soaked, seed germination takes between 14 and 21 days when the plant can be kept in a nursery for about 2 years growing in a small pot.

When the trees are approximately , they are transplanted to the field at a spacing of . After planting, the field is mulched in order to control weeds. Transplanting takes place in the rainy season because young trees are likely to be damaged by drought. Because young trees need shade, intercropping with banana, plantain, rambutan, durian or coconut leaves is effective. Coconut palms are mainly used in areas with a long dry season, as palms also provide shade for mature mangosteen trees. Another advantage of intercropping in mangosteen cultivation is the suppression of weeds.

The growth of the trees is retarded if the temperature is below . The ideal temperature range for growing and producing fruits is with relative humidity over 80%. The maximal temperature is , with both leaves and fruit being susceptible to scorching and sunburn, while the minimum temperature is . Young seedlings prefer a high level of shade and mature trees are shade-tolerant.

Mangosteen trees have a weak root system and prefer deep, well-drained soils with high moisture content, often growing on riverbanks. The mangosteen is not adapted to limestone soils, sandy, alluvial soils, or sandy soils with low organic matter content. Mangosteen trees need a well-distributed rainfall over the year (&lt;40 mm/month) and a 3–5 week dry season.

Mangosteen trees are sensitive to water availability and application of fertilizer input which is increased with the age of trees, regardless of region. Maturation of mangosteen fruits takes 5–6 months, with harvest occurring when the pericarps are purple.

===Breeding===
In the breeding of perennial mangosteen, the selection of rootstock and grafting are significant issues to overcome constraints to production, harvesting, or seasonality. Most of the genetic resources for breeding are in germplasm collections, whereas some wild species are cultivated in Malaysia and the Philippines. Conservation methods are chosen because storage of seeds under dried and low-temperature conditions has not been successful.

Because of the long duration until the trees yield fruits and the long resulting breeding cycles, mangosteen breeding has not proven attractive for transplanting or research. Breeding objectives that may enhance mangosteen production include:
* Drought tolerance, especially sensitivity to drought in the first 5 years after germination
* Tree architecture to produce a tree with a crown that is regular and pyramid-shaped
* Fruit quality including i) overcoming bitter taste components caused by changes in pulp, pericarp or aril and ii) pericarp cracking resulting from excessive water uptake
* Rootstock for improved adaptation to drought and robust development in early years of growth

===Yield===
Mangosteen trees may reach fruit-bearing in as little as 6 years but may require 12 or more years, depending on climate and cultivation methods. The yield of the mangosteen is variable, depending on the climate and age of the tree. If the young tree is bearing for the first time, 200–300 fruits may be produced, whereas at maturity, 500 fruits per season are average. At age 30 to 45 years in full maturity, each tree may yield as many as 3,000 fruits, with trees as old as 100 years still producing.

===Regional production===
Major mangosteen production occurs in Southeast Asia, mainly in Thailand as the country with the most acreage planted, estimated at 4,000 ha in 1965 and 11,000 ha in 2000, giving a total yield of 46,000 tons. Mangosteen is seasonally available in Thailand from May through September. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines are other major Asian producers. Mangosteen production in Colombia and Puerto Rico has been successful.

===Diseases and pests===
====Common diseases and pests====

The pathogens that attack mangosteen are common in other tropical trees. The diseases can be divided into foliar, fruit, stem and soil-borne diseases.

Pestalotiopsis leaf blight (&quot;Pestalotiopsis flagisettula&quot; (only identified in Thailand)) is one of the diseases that infect especially young leaves. Furthermore, the pathogen causes the fruits to rot before and after the harvest. Additional stem canker and dieback are caused by the pathogen. Some of the symptoms of stem canker are branch splitting, gummosis and bark blistering. The main areas where the disease was observed are Thailand, Malaysia, and North Queensland.

Another common disease is the thread blight or white thread blight disease (&quot;Marasmiellus scandens&quot;) whereas the name comes from the mycelia which resembles thread. Leaves, twigs, and branches may also be damaged by the disease. The spores spread with the help of wind, raindrops, and insects, and thrive in shady, humid, and wet conditions.

An important post-harvest disease affecting mangosteen, especially in Thailand is called Diplodia fruit rot (&quot;Diplodia theobromae&quot;) which, as a secondary pathogen, enters the host plant through wounds.

&quot;Phellinus noxius&quot; living on the roots and trunk bases causes brown root disease, a name derived from the appearance of the mycelium-binding soil particles. The distribution of the fungus happens through contact with infected wood or thick rhizomorphs on tree stumps.

There are a few pests that feed on mangosteen leaves and fruits including leaf eater (&quot;Stictoptera&quot; sp.), leaf miner (&quot;Phyllocnictis citrella&quot;) and fruit borer (&quot;Curculio&quot; sp.). Especially in nurseries, the larval stage of the leaf eater can cause visible damage on young leaves, but can be managed by biological control agents. The larval stage of fruit borer (&quot;Curculio&quot; sp.) feeds on different parts of fruit before ripening.

====Control measures for diseases and pests====
Different management options can be applied to control mangosteen diseases.
* Measures to inhibit sun scalding to minimize leaf blight and stem canker.
* Reduction of wounds caused by insects and storm damage to minimize disease incidence.
* Change of the microclimate by tree spacing and pruning.
* Chemicals applied to root collars and tree stumps to control root diseases.
* Fungicides to control fungal pathogens.
* Biological pest control or insecticides to control insects.

==Nutritional content==
The endocarp the white part of the fruit having a mild flavor is edible, but its nutrition content is modest, as all nutrients analyzed are at a low percentage of the Daily Value (see table for &quot;canned fruit in syrup&quot;, USDA FoodData Central; note that nutrient values for fresh fruit are likely different, but have not been published by a reputable source).

==Uses==
===Culinary===
Without fumigation or irradiation (to kill the Asian fruit fly), fresh mangosteens were illegal to import into the United States until 2007. Following export from its natural growing regions in Southeast Asia (particularly Thailand), the fresh fruit is available seasonally in some local markets in North America such as those of Chinatowns. Mangosteens are available fresh, canned and frozen in Western countries. The fruit may be served as a dessert or made into jams. In Vietnam, the ripe fruit is also used as a salad ingredient.

Upon arrival in the US in 2007, fresh mangosteens sold at up to in specialty produce stores in New York City, but wider availability and somewhat lower prices have become common in the United States and Canada. Despite efforts described above to grow mangosteen in the Western Hemisphere, nearly the entire supply is imported from Thailand.

Before ripening, the mangosteen shell is fibrous and firm but becomes soft and easy to pry open when the fruit ripens. To open a mangosteen, the shell can be scored with a knife, pried gently along the score with the thumbs until it cracks, and then pulled apart to reveal the fruit. Alternatively, the mangosteen can be opened without a knife by squeezing the shell from the bottom until it breaks, allowing the shell to be removed and the fruit eaten while intact with the stem. In Southeast Asian countries, the mangosteen is usually served with the bottom part of the shell intact. Occasionally, during peeling of ripe fruits, the purple exocarp juice may stain skin or fabric.

===Traditional medicine===
Various parts of the plant have a history of use in traditional medicine, mostly in Southeast Asia; it may have been used to treat skin infections, wounds, dysentery, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal complaints, although there is no high-quality clinical evidence for any of these effects.

Dried fruits are shipped to Singapore to be processed for medical uses which may include dysentery, skin disorders, and various other minor diseases in several countries across Asia. There is no reliable evidence that mangosteen juice, puree, bark or extracts is effective as a treatment for human diseases.

===Natural dye===
The extract of mangosteen peels is traditionally used in Indonesia as natural dye for coloring of brown, dark brown, purple or red hues applied to tenun ikat and batik textiles.

===Other uses===
Mangosteen twigs have been used as chew sticks in Ghana, and the wood has been used to make spears and cabinetry in Thailand. The rind of the mangosteen fruit has also been used to tan leather in China.

==Phytochemicals==
Mangosteen peel contains xanthonoids, such as mangostin, and other phytochemicals.
Polysaccharide and xanthone compounds are found in the fruit, leaves, and heartwood of the mangosteen. Fully ripe fruit contain the xanthones gartanin, 8-disoxygartanin, and normangostin.

==Marketing==
Fresh mangosteen is marketed for only a short period of six to ten weeks due to its seasonal nature. It is mainly grown by smallholders and sold at fruit stalls by roadsides. Its irregular, short supply leads to wide price fluctuations throughout its season and over the years. Additionally, there is no standard product quality assessment or grading system, making international trade of the fruit difficult. The mangosteen still remains rare in Western markets, though its popularity is increasing, and it is often sold at a high price.

<text>Głogów (; , rarely , ) is a city in western Poland. It is the county seat of Głogów County, in Lower Silesian Voivodeship. Głogów is the sixth largest town in the Voivodeship; its population in 2021 was 65,400. The name of the town derives from , the Polish name for hawthorn.

Among the oldest towns in Poland, Głogów was founded in the 10th century as a Piast defensive settlement and obtained city rights in the 13th century from Duke Konrad I. Due to the town&#x27;s strategic location on several trade routes, the townspeople received many privileges and benefits, which brought wealth and greatly reflected on the city&#x27;s architecture. Over time, Głogów grew to be one of the largest fortified towns in Lower Silesia. The demolition of fortifications at the beginning of the 20th century improved the chances for further growth. However, towards the end of the Second World War Głogów was once again turned into a defensive fortress and as such suffered almost complete destruction.

Currently reconstruction works are being carried out with the aim of restoring the historic pre-war appearance of the town. The castle, which was rebuilt between 1971 and 1983, now houses the Historical and Archaeological Museum, displaying artifacts such as Lusatian burial artifacts from Wróblin Głogowski. Since 1984 the town also has been the venue for the Głogów Jazz Festival, which features local and international singers, musicians and performers.

==History==

===Polish rule===
Głogów is one of the oldest towns in Poland. It was founded as a grad by a West Slavic tribe called the &quot;Dziadoszanie&quot;, one of the Polish tribes. In the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state under first historic ruler Mieszko I of Poland, who erected a new stronghold there. The first known historic record comes from 1010, in Thietmar of Merseburg&#x27;s chronicles, after the troops of King Henry II of Germany in the conflict over the March of Lusatia and the Milceni lands had attacked the forces of the Polish Duke Bolesław I Chrobry and again besieged Głogów on August 9, 1017, without result. The next year Henry and Bolesław concluded the Peace of Bautzen.
In 1109, King Henry V of Germany, entangled in the fratricidal war between the Piast dukes Bolesław III Wrymouth and Zbigniew besieged the town, but could not overcome the Polish forces in the Battle of Głogów. In 1157 the town finally fell to the forces of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, invading the Silesian lands in aid of Duke Władysław II the Exile and his sons.

In 1180, under the rule of Władysław&#x27;s II youngest son Konrad Spindleshanks, Głogów was rebuilt and became the residence of his principality, which fell back to the Duchy of Silesia upon his death about 1190. In the course of the fragmentation under Duke Bolesław II the Bald and his younger brother, the Duchy of Głogów under Duke Konrad I was established in 1251. Two years later he vested the town with Magdeburg rights. From the 13th century the city prospered thanks to trade and craft, brewing and clothmaking developed. Likewise the many Duchies of Silesia, Głogów also fell under the overlordship of King John of Bohemia in 1329.

In 1462, Głogów hosted a convention of Kings Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland and George of Poděbrady of Bohemia at which a Bohemian-Polish alliance was concluded.

In 1504 century, the Głogów line of the Silesian Piasts died out with the death of Jan II the Mad. Jan&#x27;s cruel measures had provoked the resistance of the Głogów citizens, and in 1488 the troops of King Matthias Corvinus appeared at the city gates and expelled the duke. In 1491–1506 Głogów was ruled by John Albert and Sigmund the Old, future kings of Poland.

===Czech, Austrian and Prussian rule===

In 1506 the duchy was incorporated into the Bohemian (Czech) Kingdom, although Polish King Sigismund I the Old still claimed the duchy before renouncing claims in 1508, while his wife, Polish Queen Bona Sforza still made attempts to reintegrate the city and the duchy with the Kingdom of Poland in 1522, 1526 and 1547. Nevertheless, it remained under the Czech Crown during the rule of the Jagiellonian dynasty until 1526, when it was inherited by the Austrian House of Habsburg and was incorporated into the Habsburg monarchy. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Głogów was turned into a stronghold in 1630. It was conquered by Protestants in 1632, reconquered by Imperial troops in 1633, fell to Sweden in 1642, and finally reverted to the Habsburgs in 1648.

One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the city in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland traveled that route many times. Głogów remained part of the Habsburg-ruled Crown of Bohemia until the First Silesian War. In March 1741 it was captured in a night attack by the Prussian Army under General Prince Leopold II of Anhalt-Dessau, and like the majority of Silesia became part of Kingdom of Prussia under King Frederick II. The city became known by the Germanized name of &quot;Groß-Glogau&quot; (&quot;Greater Glogau&quot;) to differentiate it from the town of &quot;Oberglogau&quot; (&quot;Upper Glogau&quot;, present-day Głogówek) in Upper Silesia. Despite Germanisation attempts, the population of the area around Głogów was still largely Polish.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Polish forces of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski were stationed in the town, and the city was also visited three times by Napoleon Bonaparte. Glogau was captured by French forces after the Battle of Jena in 1806. The town, with a garrison of 9,000 French troops, was besieged in 1813–14 by the Sixth Coalition; by the time the defenders surrendered on 10 April 1814, only 1,800 defenders remained. In 1815, after the Congress of Vienna, Glogau became part of the Prussian Province of Silesia and was therefore a part of the German Confederation and as of 1867 a part of the North German Confederation.

Because the stronghold status had slowed down the city&#x27;s development for many years, the citizens tried to abolish the stronghold status in the 19th century; the fortifications were only moved to the east in 1873, and finally taken down in 1902, which allowed the city to develop. After 1871, the city was part of the German Empire, within which it remained after the Treaty of Versailles of 1919.

In 1939 it had 33,000 mostly German inhabitants. During World War II, the Germans established six forced labour camps in the town, including a subcamp of the Nazi prison for youth in Wołów (in the present-day Paulinów district). In 1942–1945, there was also a transit camp for kidnapped Polish children intended for Germanisation, and in 1944, a transit camp for Poles transported from the transit camp in Pruszków near Warsaw after the suppression of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. Many Polish resistance members were imprisoned and sentenced to prison or death in the city. The city was made into a stronghold by the German government early in 1945 in the last stages of World War II. It was besieged for six weeks by the Soviet Red Army, which left 98% of the buildings completely destroyed.

===In modern Poland===

After May 1945 the city and the majority of Lower Silesia fell into the Soviet Zone of Occupation who expelled its German population in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and began replacing them with Polish settlers who came to the once again Polish city of Głogów to find a seriously war-damaged town; it has not been fully rebuilt to this day. The town started to develop again only in 1957, after a copper foundry was built there. It is still the largest industrial company in the town. It has since become a major world supplier of silver, which along with gold is often found in copper ore. In 1974, Głogów was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta, one of the highest Polish state decorations.

In 1945–1950, Głogów was part of Wrocław Voivodeship and in 1950 became part of the newly created Zielona Góra Voivodeship. In 1975–1998 it belonged to Legnica Voivodeship, and after the administrative reform of 1999 it became part of Lower Silesian Voivodeship.

<text>Lower Silesian Voivodeship (, ) in southwestern Poland, is one of the 16 voivodeships (provinces) into which Poland is divided. It covers an area of and has a total population of 2,899,986.

It is one of the wealthiest provinces in Poland, as natural resources such as copper, brown coal and rock materials are widely present.

Its capital and largest city is Wrocław, situated on the Oder River. The voivodeship is host to several spa towns, many castles and palaces, and the Giant Mountains, with several ski resorts. For this reason, tourism is a large part of this region&#x27;s economy.

==History==
In the past 1,200 years, the region has been part of Great Moravia, the Medieval Kingdom of Poland, the Crown of Bohemia, Kingdom of Hungary, Habsburg monarchy (Austria), Kingdom of Prussia, the German Empire, and modern Poland after 1945.
Silesian tribes settled the lands at the end of the first millennium after the Migration Period. In the 9th century, the region became part of Great Moravia under Svatopluk I of Moravia and in the 10th century, Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty eventually incorporated the region to Poland. The region withstood German invasions with decisive Polish victories at Niemcza (1017) and Głogów (1109), both commemorated with monuments. It was divided into small realms reigned by Silesian branches of Piast dukes after the testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1138. Wrocław was mentioned as one of three centers of the Kingdom of Poland, along with Kraków and Sandomierz, in the early-12th-century &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; chronicle. In 1241, it was the place of the Battle of Legnica, the largest battle of the Mongol invasions of Poland. With the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;, the cultural and ethnic Germanic influence grew with an influx of immigrants from the German-speaking areas of the Holy Roman Empire, and since the 1330s when it was subjugated to the Kingdom of Bohemia, although large portions of Lower Silesia still formed Polish-ruled duchies under the houses of Piast, Jagiellon and Sobieski, some up to the 17th and 18th century. Chief medieval ducal capitals of the area were Wrocław, Legnica, Głogów, Świdnica and Jawor. Lower Silesia was, during the Middle Ages, one of Poland&#x27;s cultural centers. The &quot;Book of Henryków&quot; (1273), which contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language, as well as a document which contains the oldest printed text in Polish, were both created within it. The first granting of municipal privileges in Poland took place in the region, with the granting of rights for Złotoryja by Henry the Bearded. Medieval municipal rights modeled after Lwówek Śląski and Środa Śląska, both established by Henry the Bearded, became the basis of municipal form of government for several cities and towns in Poland, and two of five local Polish variants of medieval town rights. Burial sights of medieval Polish monarchs from the Piast dynasty are located in the province.
In 1469, Lower Silesia passed to Hungary, and in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia, then ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, then together with it became part of the Habsburg monarchy (1526). In 1742/44, the territory was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, and subsequently became part of the German Empire (1871). Over the centuries, Lower Silesia has experienced several epochal events such as the Protestant Reformation, the Silesian Wars, Napoleonic Wars, industrialisation and the two World Wars. Before and during World War II, the region&#x27;s Polish and Jewish populations were persecuted by Nazi Germany. During the war, Germany operated numerous prisons and camps in the region, most notably the Gross-Rosen concentration camp and Stalag VIII-A prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs of various nationalities, both with multiple subcamps scattered throughout the region and beyond, including forced labour camps at the Project Riese construction project. There was also a camp for kidnapped Polish children up to 5 years of age deemed &quot;racially worthless&quot; in Wąsosz, and a youth prison in Wołów with several forced labour subcamps in the region, whereas Kamieniec Ząbkowicki was the place of &quot;Aktion T4&quot; murders of mentally ill children by involuntary euthanasia. In 1945, Lower Silesia was made again part of Poland as agreed at the post-war Potsdam Conference. As a consequence, Lower Silesia suffered a nearly total loss of its pre-war population between 1945 and 1950. Polish citizens dispossessed by the Soviets were then settled in the now emptied lands.

The voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Wrocław, Legnica, Wałbrzych and Jelenia Góra Voivodeships, following the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

==Geography==

Although much of the region is relatively low-lying, Lower Silesia includes the Sudeten Foreland, as well as part of the Sudetes mountain range, that runs along the Polish/Czech border. Ski resorts in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship include Karpacz and Szklarska Poręba in the Karkonosze mountains.

Lower Silesian Forest, the largest continuous forest of Poland, is mostly located within the voivodeship. The village of Henryków Lubański contains Poland&#x27;s oldest tree, an over-1200-year-old yew, listed as a natural monument.

The voivodeship has a number of mineral springs and is host to a large number of spa towns. The highest point in the voivodeship is Mount Śnieżka ( above sea level) while the lowest point is located in the Oder River Valley ( above sea level).

Lower Silesian Voivodeship is bordered by Lubusz Voivodeship to the north-west, Greater Poland Voivodeship to the north-east, Opole Voivodeship to the south-east, the Czech Republic (Hradec Králové Region, Liberec Region, Olomouc Region and Pardubice Region) to the south, and Germany (Saxony) to the west.

==Transport==
Wrocław Airport serves as an international and domestic airport.

Wrocław Główny is the largest railway station in Poland, serving an average of 21.2 million passengers annually. It offers the domestic and international connections of various carriers.

The A4 motorway, A8 motorway, A18 motorway and S3 Expressway, S5 Expressway, S8 Expressway also run through the voivodeship.

The Regional Museum in Środa Śląska holds the Środa Treasure, containing medieval gold and silver coins, jewellery and royal regalia, considered one of the most precious archaeological findings of 20th-century Europe. The Ossolineum in Wrocław is a National Institute and Library of great importance, and the Pan Tadeusz Museum, containing the manuscript of the Polish national epos, &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; by Adam Mickiewicz, serves as its branch. Bolesławiec, center of pottery production since the Middle Ages, hosts the Museum of Ceramics. The former gold mines in Złoty Stok and Złotoryja, tin and cobalt mine in Krobica, nickel mine in Szklary, coal mine in Nowa Ruda and uranium ore mine in Kowary are available for tourists.

===Mining===

The wealth of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship is partly due to mining and production of various minerals. The Legnica-Głogów Copper Basin () with the cities of Legnica, Głogów, Lubin and Polkowice produces copper, as well as other valuable minerals, making Poland the second largest producer of copper in Europe, and the largest producer of silver and rhenium in Europe and one of the largest in the world (as of 2024). Strzegom and its surroundings are the site of granite mining, and the town is called the &quot;capital of Polish granite&quot;. One of the three largest lignite mines in Poland is located in Bogatynia.

Wałbrzych, Nowa Ruda and Boguszów-Gorce are former bituminous coal mining centers. Szklary was the location of the country&#x27;s sole nickel ore mine, and one of only five places in the world, where the rare chrysoprase, carnelian and opal were extracted, and the place of discovery of the extremely rare szklaryite, nioboholtite and titanoholtite minerals. In the Middle Ages, gold () and silver () were mined in the region, which is reflected in the names of the former mining towns of Złotoryja, Złoty Stok and Srebrna Góra.

<doc id="322109" wikidata="Q176202" url="?curid=322109" title="Richard Grasso">
<text>Richard A. &quot;Dick&quot; Grasso (born July 26, 1946) was chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange from 1995 to 2003. He started in 1968, when he was hired by the Exchange as a floor clerk.

He later became embroiled in controversies and lawsuits about his allegedly excessive pay package and $188.5 million golden parachute. The New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit which challenged the compensation as excessive for the NYSE, which at the time was a nonprofit. However, on July 1, 2008, the New York State Court of Appeals dismissed all claims against Grasso because the NYSE had changed its status from a nonprofit to a for-profit organization, which meant that the attorney general had lost standing to sue Grasso.

==Early life and education==
Grasso was raised by his mother and two aunts in Jackson Heights in New York City. His father left the family when Richard was an infant. He graduated from Newtown High School in Queens and attended Pace University for two years before enlisting in the Army.

==Career==
===New York Stock Exchange===
Two weeks after leaving the Army in 1968, Grasso became a clerk at the New York Stock Exchange. Grasso moved up in the ranks, becoming president of the exchange and then CEO in the early 1990s. As CEO, he was credited with cementing the NYSE&#x27;s position as the preeminent U.S. stock market. Grasso also was an advisory board member for Yale School of Management.

====FARC visit====
On June 26, 1999, Reuters reported that Grasso met with Colombian rebels, the FARC. FARC is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department (on its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations since 1997) and is allegedly responsible for kidnappings and narcotics trafficking in order to bankroll their revolutionary activities (see: narcoterrorism).

The article quoted Grasso as saying, &quot;I invite members of the FARC to visit the New York Stock Exchange so that they can get to know the market personally&quot;. Some found the meeting inexplicable, considering the FARC supports anti-capitalist ideals and has no officially recognized financial clout. Grasso told reporters that he was bringing &quot;a message of cooperation from U.S. financial services&quot;.

====NYSE compensation controversy====
On August 27, 2003, it was revealed that Grasso had been given a deferred compensation pay package worth almost $140 million. This caused immediate controversy, as the hand-picked compensation committee consisted mainly of representatives from NYSE-listed companies over which Grasso had regulatory authority as its CEO.

Following criticism of the deal from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman William H. Donaldson, who preceded Grasso as Chairman of the NYSE, and several pension fund heads (who control some of the largest pools of equity investment capital in the United States), the NYSE board asked Grasso to leave in a 13–7 vote. He stepped down on September 17, 2003, and several senior officials followed in the same month. Law firm Winston &amp; Strawn carried out an investigation, on behalf of the NYSE, and a comprehensive report analyzing Grasso&#x27;s alleged excessive compensation and benefits, and the governance failures behind it, was completed in December.

====Lawsuit====
On May 24, 2004, Grasso was sued by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer demanding repayment of the majority of the $140 million pay package. Prior to being dismissed Grasso had been in line to receive an additional $48 million over the $139.5 million he had already received; he was not paid the additional funds.

On May 26, 2004, Grasso responded with a counter-suit against the Exchange and its chairman John Reed. The counterclaim was twofold; It sought restitution of unpaid portions of his retirement package and further accused certain individuals at the Exchange of &quot;besmirching his name&quot;. Grasso went on to place a 1,500-word op-ed article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; detailing this counter-suit as well as his grievances against Spitzer. The lawsuit against Grasso continued to move toward trial in 2006 with neither side showing any interest in settling.

On October 19, 2006, it was reported that the New York State Supreme Court issued a summary decision ordering Grasso to repay a significant amount of excess compensation in an article entitled &quot;Ex-NYSE chief ordered to return part of $188M&quot;. Although Grasso will appeal, the same article reports that Spitzer&#x27;s office has disclosed the amount of restitution to be in the tens of millions of dollars. In his ruling, Judge Ramos wrote that Grasso&#x27;s failure to disclose the true extent of his total compensation prevented the compensation committee from exercising its fiduciary duties. The above CNN article also reported that Grasso&#x27;s counterclaim of defamation was dismissed.

On July 1, 2008, the New York State Court of Appeals dismissed all claims against Grasso. The majority opinion stated that since the NYSE was now a subsidiary of a for-profit multinational corporation, the State of New York had no oversight over the affairs of the company in this matter and that prosecution was &quot;not in the public interest&quot;. Current attorney general Andrew Cuomo stated that he had no intention to appeal this decision any further and that the case was effectively over. The court ruled that Grasso was entitled to the entirety of his compensation. The court also dismissed Grasso&#x27;s actions against the NYSE and other parties as related to this matter.

During an SEC investigation Grasso invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions regarding his conduct during an NYSE investigation into possibly improper activities by Exchange specialist firms. The specialist firms paid $242 million in settlements with the SEC, and the NYSE itself was censured for failing to properly supervise the specialist firms.

The suit against Grasso came under criticism, with journalist Charles Gasparino lambasting it in the epilogue to his book, &quot;Blood on the Street&quot;. He is the subject of a book by Gasparino, &quot;King of the Club&quot;.

<doc id="322110" wikidata="Q1009298" url="?curid=322110" title="Swanage">
<text>Swanage () is a coastal town and civil parish in the south east of Dorset, England. It is at the eastern end of the Isle of Purbeck and one of its two towns, approximately south of Poole and east of Dorchester. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 9,601. Nearby are Ballard Down and Old Harry Rocks, with Studland Bay and Poole Harbour to the north. Within the parish are Durlston Bay and Durlston Country Park to the south of the town. The parish also includes the areas of Herston, just to the west of the town, and Durlston, just to the south.

The town, originally a small port and fishing village, flourished in the Victorian era, when it first became a significant quarrying port and later a seaside resort for the rich of the day. Today the town remains a popular tourist resort, this being the town&#x27;s primary industry, with many thousands of visitors coming to the town during the peak summer season, drawn by the bay&#x27;s sandy beaches and other attractions.

During its history the bay was listed variously as Swanawic, Swanwich and Sandwich, and only in more recent history as Swanage.

The town is located at the eastern end of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The town contains many listed buildings and two conservation areas – Swanage Conservation Area and Herston Conservation Area.

== History ==

While fishing is likely the town&#x27;s oldest industry, quarrying has been important to the town and the local area since at least the first century AD. During the time of the Roman occupation this industry grew, with the distinctive Purbeck marble being used for decorative purposes in buildings as far away as London. When the Romans left Britain, quarrying largely ceased until the 12th century.

The town is first mentioned in historical texts in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; of 877. It is stated as being the scene of a Danish naval disaster: &quot;This year came the Danish army into Exeter from Wareham; whilst the navy sailed west about, until they met with a great mist at sea, and there perished one hundred and twenty ships at Swanwich.&quot; The Danish ships were driven by a storm onto Peveril Point, a shallow rocky reef outcropping from the southern end of Swanage Bay. A monument topped (historically incorrectly) by cannonballs was built in 1862 by John Mowlem at the southern end of the seafront promenade to mark this event - interpreted as great naval victory by King Alfred.

In the 12th century demand for Purbeck Marble grew once again. While Purbeck marble is not suited to external use, as it does not weather well, it is however strong and suitably decorative for use as internal columns. As such the stone was used in the construction of many large churches and cathedrals being built at the time.

In contrast to the decorative Purbeck marble, Purbeck limestone, or more commonly &#x27;Purbeck stone&#x27;, has been used in construction locally since the early days of quarrying on Purbeck. Its use is less well documented as it was taken for granted as the default construction materials in the area. However, the arrival of more modern quarrying techniques in the 17th century resulted in an increase in production. The Great Fire of London in 1666 led to a period of large-scale reconstruction in the city, and Purbeck stone was extensively used for paving. It was in this time that stone first started being loaded upon ships directly from the Swanage seafront; before this time quarried stone had been first transported to Poole for shipping.

The idea that Swanage could become a tourist destination was first encouraged by a local MP William Morton Pitt in the early 19th century, who converted a mansion in the town into a luxury hotel. The hotel is noted for having been visited in 1833 by the (then) Princess Victoria, later to become queen. The building was later renamed the Royal Victoria Hotel, now the building has been converted into flats and a bar and nightclub in the left and right wings respectively.


=== Mowlem and Burt – the Victorian era ===

The town&#x27;s greatest prominence came during the Victorian period. John Mowlem (1788–1868), a Swanage resident, became a successful builder in London, creating the Mowlem construction company, which still existed as recently as 2006, when it was acquired by another company, Carillion.

John Mowlem made his business in London by importing stone into the city from around the country, including Purbeck limestone. Through this process, many relics and monuments were brought from London to Swanage in the 19th century by Mowlem and his nephew George Burt (1816–1894) who took over the business when Mowlem retired. It is said that these items brought from London were used as ballast for the empty vessels which transported the Purbeck stone to London.

These include the big clock tower near Peveril Point. The clock tower, commemorating the Duke of Wellington, designed by Arthur Ashpitel, was built in 1854 at the southern approach to the old London Bridge. Within 10 years it became an obstruction to traffic on the busy bridge and had to be removed. It was re-erected 1867–68 on its present site at the southern end of the bay on the sea front. A further item transported from London to Swanage is the 1860 façade of the Mercers&#x27; Hall, that was used as the façade of the Swanage Town Hall, which was designed by G. R. Crickmay (1830–1907) of Weymouth, and built during the early 1880s. Immediately behind the town hall, but pre-dating it, is the Swanage lock-up. Dating from 1803, it is a scheduled monument.

Mowlem and Burt were highly influential in the development of the town, taking an active interest in their town of birth into retirement. Between them they were responsible for the building of much of the town&#x27;s infrastructure, including the town&#x27;s first pier, the Mowlem Institute (a reading room), the first gas and water works, and the development of the Durlston estate and Country Park, at the southern end of the town. The Great Globe which can be found slightly south of Durlston Castle, both also designed by Crickmay, in the Durlston Country Park was completed by George Burt in 1887. It is made up of 15 sections of stone and joined with granite dowels. The Great Globe weighs and is in diameter. Burt was responsible for the erection of the first civic memorial to Prince Albert, the Prince Albert Memorial, in 1862.

Newton Manor House on the High Street was a 17th-century farmhouse, remodelled in the 18th and 19th centuries. For some centuries the house and estate belonged to the Cockram family. In c1876 it was bought by Sir John Charles Robinson, Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Swanage Lighthouse was built in 1880, on the clifftop at Anvil Point, not far away from Durlston Castle.

The railways were introduced to the town in 1885 with the encouragement of Burt by the London and South Western Railway Company. By this time the town was becoming a popular resort destination for the wealthy, noted for its fine weather and clean air. The town previously had been fairly cut off due to its valley location, but the introduction of the railway made the town much more accessible to visitors, with direct services running from London. However, the greatest increase in visitors came with the building of the second &#x27;new&#x27; pier in 1895, built primarily for use by pleasure steamers.

=== The Great War to the present ===
The town enjoyed several decades quietly being successful as a seaside resort. The First World War left few physical marks on the town; however, during the Second World War gun emplacements and pillboxes were built at spots along the shoreline at the southern end of the bay. The town also received bomb damage during the Second World War, with 20 people killed. The town and other nearby villages are noted for playing a part in the development of radar.

After the Second World War the town, like many other seaside resorts and indeed the country at large, suffered a recession with few people able to spare the money for holidaying. In 1972 the Swanage branch line of the railway was closed by British Rail as part of larger network-wide cutbacks. A group of local enthusiasts formed a charitable organisation with the purpose of restoring and preserving the branch line and steam and diesel locomotives to run along it, forming the Swanage Railway.

Through the years Swanage has suffered from flooding, with severe flooding occurring as recently as 1990. In 1993 a large-scale flood alleviation scheme was completed, ending in the banjo-shaped &#x27;new jetty&#x27; outletting rainwater. This in itself created a new problem, disturbing the natural northward drift of sand up the bay, with a buildup on the southern side and reduction of sand on the northern. This reduction of sand levels exposed the foundations of parts of the seawall threatening to damage it. As a result, the beach was improved in 2005–06 by construction of new greenheart timber groynes and the placement of of sand as beach nourishment.

== Governance ==

Local governance and service provision is provided by Swanage Town Council (based at Swanage Town Hall) and the newly formed unitary authority Dorset Council. Swanage is represented within Dorset council by two councillors from the Swanage Ward, William Trite and Gary Suttle of the Conservative Party. This changed with a local government reorganisation in 2019 from a two-tier structure (Purbeck District Council and Dorset County Council), to a single-tier unitary authority (Dorset Council) covering rural Dorset. In terms of UK parliamentary representation, Swanage falls within the constituency of South Dorset and is represented since 2024 by Lloyd Hatton of Labour.

=== Town Council ===

Swanage Town Council is the Parish Authority based in the historic town hall in the High Street. Services provided by the Town Council include – &quot;sport and recreational facilities, beach, tourist information and promotion of tourists, caravan parks, off-street car parks, public conveniences, cemeteries, allotments&quot;. The Town Council consists of twelve elected Councillors, elected from two electoral wards (Swanage North and Swanage south), who each serve 4-year terms (after an initial 5-year term from 2019 due to local government re-organisation). As of the 2019 local elections, the political makeup of the Town Council is 10 Conservative Councillors (57% of total votes) and 2 Labour Councillors (23% of total votes). These Councillors appoint a chairman to act as the Town Mayor, currently Cllr Avril Harris. Working groups and committees are formed for specific concerns and functions such as; Transport, Capital Projects and General Operations. The council employs around 30 staff to deliver its services who are managed by the Town Clerk and various sub managers.

== Geography and geology ==

Swanage faces to the east Swanage Bay in Dorset on the south coast of England. The bay is at the eastern end of the Isle of Purbeck, approximately south of Poole and east of Dorchester. The northern headland of the bay is formed of chalk, the southern of Purbeck Limestone, with softer primarily Wealden clays forming the bay and valley in which the town is sited. The Purbeck limestone was extensively quarried with several sites to the south west showing evidence of former quarries, particularly Tilly Whim Caves and Dancing Ledge, a man-made rock shelf used for loading ships. Natural erosion has formed stacks along and at the end of the northern headland, in particular the notable Old Harry Rocks. In part through the process of quarrying, fossils from the dinosaur age have been discovered in the local rock, and the coastline up to and including Swanage Bay has been included in the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.

===Climate===

As with the rest of the British Isles Swanage experiences a maritime climate with warm (but not hot) summers and cool winters. Within this climate zone, Swanage&#x27;s coastal location ensures a smaller range in annual temperature than in places further inland. The Met Office operates a weather station at the town, and temperature extremes recorded range from in January 1963 up to during July 1976. Rainfall typically peaks in winter, and is at its lowest during summer. The town&#x27;s position on an east-facing bay provides it some protection from the prevailing southwesterly winds.

== Economy ==

Swanage&#x27;s primary sources of employment are wholesale and retail trade (including mechanics), health and social work, and accommodation and food service activities. The town has a tourism industry; however, the demand level is highly seasonal, and as such people looking for permanent work may have to commute to nearby towns such as Poole and Bournemouth.
The town centre has a few medium-sized outlets for major retailers, a collection of local retailers, a number of cafes, bars, restaurants and pubs. The seafront has two amusement arcades, several ice cream outlets, fish restaurants and cafes. The town also has a number of successful small-scale cottage industries.

There is a brickworks on the outskirts of the town that uses the Wealden Clay found in the valley for producing bricks, and quarrying still continues to the south.

During the peak summer season many people are drawn by the town&#x27;s beautiful setting, the beach and other attractions. The town has numerous hotels and guest rooms though the number (particularly of hotels) has reduced slightly in recent years. Swanage has a gently sloping white sand beach which is sheltered and generally calm. The beach is well served by local businesses providing refreshments and services. For hire are deck chairs, boats, pedalos and general watersports equipment. There are amusement arcades and parks.

Besides the beach, other local attractions include the restored Swanage Steam Railway, the Victorian Swanage Pier, and Durlston Country Park National Nature Reserve. The town may also be used a base from which to visit other nearby areas of interest, such as Corfe Castle.
== Culture ==

As a small town there are no large cultural institutions based in the town, though there are a number of small clubs and groups, including the Swanage Town Band formed in the late 19th century. The largest facility in the town is the Mowlem Theatre, on the site of the former Mowlem Institute, opened in 1967. Performing a dual role as a 400-seat theatre and cinema, the complex also hosts a bar and restaurant and a small collection of shops. Typically there are around 200 film showings and 60–100 nights of live theatre.

Swanage has a Detached Flight of the Air Training Corps which regularly partakes in activities around the town, including charitable collections, training exercises and parades. 2185 (Swanage) DF is attached to 2185 (Wareham) Squadron ATC as its parent unit.

=== Festivals and events ===

The town hosts a number of annual festivals and events. In the summer months there is a carnival week which includes a procession of floats and dancers and several firework displays, and many other attractions and small events including live music from various bands from all over Southern England, races and a regatta.

The railway used to have special Thomas the Tank Engine themed events, and other special services.

The town also hosts successful festivals, which attract more than a purely local audience. These include a jazz festival, a folk festival, a blues festival, and there are plans for a food festival in the future.

New Year&#x27;s Eve has traditionally been a big event for Swanage, with the town drawing more people from surrounding areas, and people travelling considerable distances to attend. In part this has been due to attendance by employees of the nearby Wytch Farm oil processing facility. While the popularity of the event has waned somewhat from its peak in the early 1990s, with fewer oil employees in the area, there is still a large gathering each year, spilling out into the square and High Street at midnight. It is a long-standing tradition in Swanage for people to dress up for New Year&#x27;s Eve to add to the atmosphere. There is no specific fancy dress &quot;theme&quot;.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter.

== Churches ==

There are several church congregations in Swanage, many of which meet at sites of historic interest. St Mary&#x27;s Anglican Church was rebuilt from 1860 and Swanage Methodist Church was built in 1886. There are also three more Anglican churches, Emmanuel Baptist Church, a Quakers&#x27; meeting house, Roman Catholic, Salvation Army and United Reformed Church. All the churches are part of the ecumenical group known as &quot;Churches Together in Swanage and District&quot; which also extends to churches within Langton Matravers, Kingston and Worth Matravers.

The town also has the &quot;Old Stable&quot;, a Christian-led community centre in the town centre.

== Transport ==

Swanage is accessible by main road either through Wareham and its bypass or via the Sandbanks Ferry which provides a shorter route to Bournemouth. There is a minor road connecting Swanage to East Lulworth via Corfe Castle but this passes through a military firing range and is closed during firing exercises.

The main bus services are provided by Morebus. Number 40 runs between Swanage and Poole, number 30 between Swanage and Weymouth (summer time only), and the number 50 runs between Swanage and Bournemouth via the Sandbanks Ferry. Double-deck open top buses are used on the Poole and Bournemouth to Swanage routes in the summer months. The buses on these routes are branded as Purbeck Breezers. The Bournemouth to Swanage route was voted one of Britain&#x27;s top three scenic bus routes in 2018.

Swanage has a restored heritage steam railway which operates for most of the year. In February 2013 the Swanage Railway obtained a government grant of £1.47 million to re-introduce regular services to the main line at Wareham. The physical connection between the Swanage Railway and the main line has been restored but is currently used only during the summer months. In 2023 a regular four-day-a-week service from Wareham was restored between April and September. Limited ferry services also run between Poole Quay and Swanage Pier. These are used by Swanage residents for shopping trips to Poole&#x27;s large shopping centre, and also by tourists in Poole for day trips into Swanage.

To avoid the narrow A351 through Corfe Castle village and parking in Swanage, a park and ride facility operates at Norden, with connections into Swanage provided by Swanage Railway steam trains or buses on routes 30 and 40. Together with Swanage Railway trains from Wareham, boat trips from Poole and the scenic bus route from Bournemouth, this provides an unusually wide and attractive range of public transport options with low carbon footprint for visiting the town.

The nearest mainline railway station to Swanage is Wareham, with South Western Railway services westward to Dorchester South and Weymouth and eastwards towards Poole, Bournemouth, Southampton Central and London Waterloo.

National Express Coaches operate a daily coach service from Swanage to London (One journey each way, to London in the morning, back in the evening).

== Education ==
=== Current ===
Swanage has four primary schools covering academic years 1–6; St Mary&#x27;s Catholic, St Mark&#x27;s CE, St George&#x27;s CE, and Swanage Primary School (also known by its location of Mount Scar.)

Swanage has one secondary school, The Swanage School.

The town has a library in the town centre housed in a distinctive 1960s octagonal glass and Purbeck Stone building.

A small museum (the Swanage Museum &amp; Heritage Centre) with artefacts and displays recounting the town and surrounding area&#x27;s history is located at the square on the seafront. The museum had previously been housed in the historical Tithe Barn building; however, mounting maintenance costs forced the relocation of much of the collection to the new site, with the remainder in storage.

=== Former ===

Until 2013 schools in Purbeck District operated as part of a three-tier comprehensive pyramid system. Under this system, the Purbeck Secondary School in Wareham was fed by the various middle schools in the Purbeck district, including the former Swanage Middle School on the edge of the town at Herston. These in turn were fed by the district&#x27;s primary schools. However, in November 2010 a move to change to a two-tier system was approved following a proposal from Dorset County Council in May of that year. This culminated in the closure of Purbeck&#x27;s Middle Schools in September 2013. As a further result the district&#x27;s primary schools, including the 4 in Swanage are required to accommodate children through two additional school years. These cover years 1–6, with children moving on to secondary education from year 7 onwards.

Concern from parents and teachers following the original announcement of these plans prompted the formation of the Education Swanage group, who put together a proposal to form a free school in the town to provide secondary education. Having successfully completed several rounds of reviews with the Department for Education, Education Swanage&#x27;s proposal was finally accepted in October 2011. &quot;The Swanage School&quot; opened in September 2013 temporarily located at Harrow House, an international language school within the town until the new building became ready. Pupils moved to the new building in Easter 2014.

Harrow House, a large former private language school in the town catered for foreign pupils. The school, founded in 1969 had a large white pressurised dome which serves as a sports hall, which was visible from some distance. The school closed during the pandemic of 2020 and did not reopen.

Adjacent to Harrow House was Purbeck View School, owned by Cambian Education. This school catered to the needs of autistic children and teenagers and provides boarding facilities. Following a number of issue with Ofsted inspections and reducing the number of young people served
 the school finally closed in August 2023.

There was a Swanage Grammar School between 1929 and 1974.

== Public services ==
The town is served by a small fire station provided by Dorset &amp; Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service and located centrally within the town. Swanage Police Station, originally opened in 1899 and was operated by Dorset Police, before being closed in November 2012.

Swanage Hospital is a community hospital provided by Dorset Healthcare with an accompanying Ambulance Station provided by the South Western Ambulance Service. The hospital has a Minor Injuries Unit, providing basic emergency care from 8am to 8pm, inpatient and outpatient departments, an operating theatre, radiography, physiotherapy and occupational therapy departments. Swanage Medical Practice provides GP services.

Given the coastal location, the town is also served by Swanage Lifeboat Station, an RNLI lifeboat station, a HM Coastguard post, and a National Coastwatch Institution station.

Many beauty spots are in walkable distance, while never being too far from refreshment. The town is on the Dorset Coast Path with attractive cliffs walks to Old Harry Rocks and Studland to the north, and Durlston Head and Lulworth Cove to the south and west.

===Parks===

Swanage has a King George&#x27;s Field near the centre of town in memorial to King George V, which includes large playing fields, as well as skate park facilities and a hi-tech play area, both funded by community groups.
There are plans also for the building of a new sports pavilion at the park, to replace the previous building which had been demolished due to safety concerns. Parks in the town centre include Prince Albert Gardens, where the Prince Albert Memorial is now located, and the Recreation Ground, where the war memorial and bandstand are located, and where a memorial to Trevor Chadwick is proposed (2021) to be located.

===Water sport===

Swanage bay provides a well sheltered environment for a range of watersports, including swimming, kayaking, canoeing, sailing, windsurfing and jetskiing.

Scuba diving takes place under the piers and at nearby coastal wrecks. Swanage is considered by many to be the home of British scuba diving. It is one of the most popular sea water training sites for dive schools and clubs to take trainee divers due to the sheltered conditions within the bay. The dive school on the pier was the first dive school in Great Britain.

Swanage Sailing club was established in 1935 and is located immediately south of the pier.

Swanage Sea Rowing Club, formed in 2001 has been highly successful and currently has over 100 members and four Cornish pilot gigs of its own, funded through donations. Competitions take place at regattas of which the club attends several per year, including the World Pilot Gig Championships held on the Isles of Scilly.

Between 1934 and 1936 Swanage was the home of artist Paul Nash. He worked on the &quot;Shell Guide to Dorset&quot; and produced a considerable number of paintings and photographs during this period. Also staying in Swanage at this time was the surrealist Eileen Agar, with whom Nash collaborated.
In 1936 Nash wrote an essay entitled &quot;Swanage or Seaside Surrealism&quot;, in which he described the town as having something &quot;of a dream image where things are so often incongruous and slightly frightening in their relation to time or place.&quot;

Artist and writer Philip Sugden was born and raised in Swanage. He is known for his drawings and paintings of India and Tibet, and his books entitled &quot;Visions From the Fields of Merit&quot; and &quot;White Lotus&quot;.

<text>The Mukden incident was a false flag event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

On September 18, 1931, Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto of the of the detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a railway line owned by Japan&#x27;s South Manchuria Railway near Mukden (now Shenyang). The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, and a train passed over it minutes later. The Imperial Japanese Army accused Chinese dissidents of the act and responded with a full invasion that led to the occupation of Manchuria, in which Japan established its puppet state of Manchukuo 5 months later. The deception was exposed by the Lytton Report of 1932, leading Japan to diplomatic isolation and its March 1933 withdrawal from the League of Nations.

==Names==
In English, the Mukden incident is also known as the Manchurian incident. In Japanese, &quot;Manchurian incident&quot; (Kyūjitai: , Shinjitai: , &quot;Manshū-jihen&quot;) usually refers to the entire sequence of events (including the invasion), rather than just the initial September 1931 attack on the railway line. In Chinese, the attack on the railway line is known as the Liutiao Lake incident () and the &quot;September 18 incident&quot; () refers to the entire sequence of events.

==Background==

Japanese economic presence and political interest in Manchuria had been growing ever since the end of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). The Treaty of Portsmouth that ended the war had granted Japan the lease of the South Manchuria Railway branch (from Changchun to Lüshun) of the China Far East Railway. The Japanese government, however, claimed that this control included all the rights and privileges that China granted to Russia in the 1896 Li–Lobanov Treaty, as enlarged by the Kwantung Lease Agreement of 1898. This included absolute and exclusive administration within the South Manchuria Railway Zone. Japanese railway guards were stationed within the zone to provide security for the trains and tracks; however, these were regular Japanese soldiers, and they frequently carried out maneuvers outside the railway areas.

Meanwhile, the newly formed Chinese government was attempting to reassert its authority over the country after over a decade of fragmented warlord dominance. They started to claim that treaties between China and Japan were invalid. China also announced new acts, so the Japanese people (including Koreans and Taiwanese as both regions were under Japanese rule at this time) who had settled frontier lands, opened stores or built their own houses in China were expelled without any compensation. Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin tried to deprive Japanese concessions too, but he was assassinated by the Japanese Kwantung Army. Zhang Xueliang, Zhang&#x27;s son and successor, joined the Nanjing Government led by Chiang Kai-shek from anti-Japanese sentiment. Official Japanese objections to the oppression against Japanese nationals within China were rejected by the Chinese authorities.

The 1929 Sino-Soviet conflict (July–November) over the Chinese Eastern Railroad (CER) further increased the tensions in the Northeast that would lead to the Mukden incident. The Soviet Red Army victory over Zhang Xueliang&#x27;s forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.

The Soviet Red Army performance also stunned Japanese officials. Manchuria was central to Japan&#x27;s East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan&#x27;s commitment to be the dominant power in Manchuria. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.

In April 1931, a national leadership conference of China was held between Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang in Nanjing. They agreed to put aside their differences and assert China&#x27;s sovereignty in Manchuria strongly. On the other hand, some officers of the Kwantung Army began to plot to invade Manchuria secretly. There were other officers who wanted to support plotters in Tokyo.

==Events==

Believing that a conflict in Manchuria would be in the best interests of Japan, Kwantung Army Colonel Seishirō Itagaki and Lieutenant Colonel Kanji Ishiwara independently devised a plan to prompt Japan to invade Manchuria by provoking an incident from Chinese forces stationed nearby. However, after the Japanese Minister of War Jirō Minami dispatched Major General Yoshitsugu Tatekawa to Manchuria for the specific purpose of curbing the insubordination and militarist behavior of the Kwantung Army, Itagaki and Ishiwara believed that they no longer had the luxury of waiting for the Chinese to respond to provocations but had to stage their own.

Itagaki and Ishiwara chose to sabotage the rail section in an area near Liutiao Lake (; &quot;liǔtiáohú&quot;). The area had no official name and was not militarily important, but it was only eight hundred meters away from the Chinese garrison of Beidaying (; &quot;běidàyíng&quot;), where troops under the command of the &quot;Young Marshal&quot; Zhang Xueliang were stationed. The Japanese plan was to attract Chinese troops by an explosion and then blame them for having caused the disturbance in order to provide a pretext for a formal Japanese invasion. In addition, they intended to make the sabotage appear more convincing as a calculated Chinese attack on an essential target, thereby making the expected Japanese reaction appear as a legitimate measure to protect a vital railway of industrial and economic importance. The Japanese press labeled the site &quot;Liǔtiáo Ditch&quot; (; &quot;liǔtiáogōu) or &quot;Liǔtiáo Bridge&quot; (; &quot;liǔtiáoqiáo), when in reality, the site was a small railway section laid on an area of flat land. The choice to place the explosives at this site was to preclude the extensive rebuilding that would have been necessitated had the site actually been a railway bridge.

==Incident==

Colonel Seishirō Itagaki, Lieutenant Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, Colonel Kenji Doihara, and Major Takayoshi Tanaka had completed plans for the incident by May 31, 1931.
The plan was executed when 1st Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto of the Independent Garrison Unit (獨立守備隊) of the 29th Infantry Regiment, which guarded the South Manchuria Railway, placed explosives near the tracks, but far enough away to do no real damage. At around 10:20 p.m. (22:20), September 18, the explosives were detonated. However, the explosion was minor and only a 1.5-meter section on one side of the rail was damaged. In fact, a train from Changchun passed by the site on this damaged track without difficulty and arrived in Shenyang at 10:30 p.m. (22:30).

==Invasion of Manchuria==

On the morning of September 19, two artillery pieces installed at the Shenyang officers&#x27; club opened fire on the Chinese garrison nearby, in response to the alleged Chinese attack on the railway. Zhang Xueliang&#x27;s small air force was destroyed, and his soldiers fled their destroyed Beidaying barracks, as five hundred Japanese troops attacked the Chinese garrison of around seven thousand. The Chinese troops were no match for the experienced Japanese troops. By the evening, the fighting was over, and the Japanese had occupied Mukden at the cost of five hundred Chinese lives and only two Japanese lives.

At Dalian in the Kwantung Leased Territory, Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army General Shigeru Honjō was at first appalled that the invasion plan was enacted without his permission, but he was eventually convinced by Ishiwara to give his approval after the act. Honjō moved the Kwantung Army headquarters to Mukden and ordered General Senjuro Hayashi of the Chosen Army of Japan in Korea to send in reinforcements. At 04:00 on 19 September, Mukden was declared secure.

Zhang Xueliang personally ordered his men not to put up a fight and to store away any weapons when the Japanese invaded. Therefore, the Japanese soldiers proceeded to occupy and garrison the major cities of Changchun and Dandong and their surrounding areas with minimal difficulty. However, in November, General Ma Zhanshan, the acting governor of Heilongjiang, began resistance with his provincial army, followed in January by Generals Ding Chao and Li Du with their local Jilin provincial forces. Despite this resistance, within five months of the Mukden incident, the Imperial Japanese Army had overrun all major towns and cities in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang.

==Aftermath==
Chinese public opinion strongly criticized Zhang Xueliang for his non-resistance to the Japanese invasion. While the Japanese presented a real threat, the Kuomintang directed most of their efforts towards eradication of the communist party. Many charged that Zhang&#x27;s Northeastern Army of nearly a quarter million could have withstood the Kwantung Army of only 11,000 men. In addition, his arsenal in Manchuria was considered the most modern in China, and his troops had possession of tanks, around 60 combat aircraft, 4000 machine guns, and four artillery battalions.

Zhang Xueliang&#x27;s seemingly superior force was undermined by several factors. The first was that the Kwantung Army had a strong reserve force that could be transported by railway from Korea, which was a Japanese colony, directly adjacent to Manchuria. Secondly, more than half of Zhang&#x27;s troops were stationed south of the Great Wall in Hebei Province, while the troops north of the wall were scattered throughout Manchuria. Therefore, deploying Zhang&#x27;s troops north of the Great Wall meant that they lacked the concentration needed to fight the Japanese effectively. Most of Zhang&#x27;s troops were under-trained, poorly led, poorly fed, and had poor morale and questionable loyalty compared to their Japanese counterparts. Japanese secret agents had permeated Zhang&#x27;s command because of his and his father Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s past reliance on Japanese military advisers. The Japanese knew the Northeastern Army very well and were able to conduct operations with ease.

The Chinese government was preoccupied with numerous internal problems, including the issue of the newly independent Guangzhou government of Hu Hanmin, Chinese Communist Party insurrections, and 1931 China floods of the Yangtze River that created tens of thousands of refugees. Moreover, Zhang himself was not in Manchuria at the time, but was in a hospital in Beijing to raise money for the flood victims. However, in the Chinese newspapers, Zhang was ridiculed as &quot;General Nonresistance&quot; ().

Because of these circumstances, the central government turned to the international community for a peaceful resolution. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a strong protest to the Japanese government and called for the immediate stop to Japanese military operations in Manchuria, and appealed to the League of Nations, on September 19. On October 24, the League of Nations passed a resolution mandating the withdrawal of Japanese troops, to be completed by 16 November. However, Japan rejected the League of Nations resolution and insisted on direct negotiations with the Chinese government. Negotiations went on intermittently without much result.

On November 20, a conference in the Chinese government was convened, but the Guangzhou faction of the Kuomintang insisted that Chiang Kai-shek step down to take responsibility for the Manchurian debacle. On December 15, Chiang resigned as the Chairman of the Nationalist government and was replaced as Premier of the Republic of China (head of the Executive Yuan) by Sun Fo, son of Sun Yat-sen. Jinzhou, another city in Liaoning, was lost to the Japanese in early January 1932. As a result, Wang Jingwei replaced Sun Fo as the Premier.

On January 7, 1932, United States Secretary of State Henry Stimson issued his Stimson Doctrine, that the United States would not recognize any government that was established as the result of Japanese actions in Manchuria. On January 14, a League of Nations commission, headed by Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, disembarked at Shanghai to examine the situation. In March, the puppet state of Manchukuo was established, with the former emperor of China, Puyi, installed as head of state.

On October 2, the Lytton Report was published and rejected the Japanese claim that the Manchurian invasion and occupation was an act of self-defense, although it did not assert that the Japanese had perpetrated the initial bombing of the railroad. The report ascertained that Manchukuo was the product of Japanese military aggression in China, while recognizing that Japan had legitimate concerns in Manchuria because of its economic ties there. The League of Nations refused to acknowledge Manchukuo as an independent nation. Japan resigned from the League of Nations in March 1933. It thereafter became more aggressive in China.

Colonel Kenji Doihara used the Mukden incident to continue his campaign of disinformation. Since the Chinese troops at Mukden had put up such poor resistance, he told Manchukuo Emperor Puyi that this was proof that the Chinese remained loyal to him. Japanese intelligence used the incident to continue the campaign to discredit the murdered Zhang Zuolin and his son Zhang Xueliang for &quot;misgovernment&quot; of Manchuria. In fact, drug trafficking and corruption had largely been suppressed under Zhang Zuolin.

==Controversy==
Different opinions still exist as to who caused the explosion on the Japanese railroad at Mukden. Strong evidence points to young officers of the Japanese Kwantung Army having conspired to cause the blast, with or without direct orders from Tokyo. Post-war investigations confirmed that the original bomb planted by the Japanese failed to explode, and a replacement had to be planted. The resulting explosion enabled the Japanese Kwantung Army to accomplish their goal of triggering a conflict with Chinese troops stationed in Manchuria and the subsequent establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo.

The 9.18 Incident Exhibition Museum (九・一八歷史博物館) at Shenyang, opened by the People&#x27;s Republic of China on September 18, 1991, takes the position that the explosives were planted by Japan. The Yūshūkan museum, located within Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, also places the blame on members of the Kwantung Army.

David Bergamini&#x27;s book &quot;Japan&#x27;s Imperial Conspiracy&quot; (1971) has a detailed chronology of events in both Manchuria and Tokyo surrounding the Mukden incident. Bergamini concludes that the greatest deception was that the Mukden incident and Japanese invasion were planned by junior or hot-headed officers, without formal approval by the Japanese government. However, historian James Weland has concluded that senior commanders had tacitly allowed field operatives to proceed on their own initiative, then endorsed the result after a positive outcome was assured.

In August 2006, the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, Japan&#x27;s top-selling newspaper, published the results of a year-long research project into the general question of who was responsible for the &quot;Shōwa war&quot;. With respect to the Manchurian incident, the newspaper blamed ambitious Japanese militarists, as well as politicians who were impotent to rein them in or prevent their insubordination.

Debate has also focused on how the incident was handled by the League of Nations and the subsequent Lytton Report. A. J. P. Taylor wrote that &quot;In the face of its first serious challenge&quot;, the League buckled and capitulated. The Washington Naval Conference (1921) guaranteed a certain degree of Japanese hegemony in East Asia. Any intervention on the part of America would be a breach of the already mentioned agreement. Furthermore, Britain was in crisis, having been recently forced off the gold standard. Although a power in East Asia at the time, Britain was incapable of decisive action. The only response from these powers was &quot;moral condemnation&quot;.

== Historiography ==
In 2017, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officially recognized the Mukden incident as the start of its &quot;War of Resistance&quot; against the Empire of Japan as opposed to the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge incident. Historian Emily Matson stated that this shift in the official timeline is part of a domestic &quot;legitimizing narrative&quot; that aims to enhance the CCP&#x27;s prestige and discredit the Nationalist government&#x27;s &quot;nonresistance policy&quot; at the time.

==Remembrance==
Each year at 10:00 a.m. on 18 September, air-raid sirens sound for several minutes in numerous major cities across China. Provinces include Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hainan, and others.

<text>In computing, Chord is a protocol and algorithm for a peer-to-peer distributed hash table. A distributed hash table stores key-value pairs by assigning keys to different computers (known as &quot;nodes&quot;); a node will store the values for all the keys for which it is responsible. Chord specifies how keys are assigned to nodes, and how a node can discover the value for a given key by first locating the node responsible for that key.

Chord is one of the four original distributed hash table protocols, along with CAN, Tapestry, and Pastry. It was introduced in 2001 by Ion Stoica, Robert Morris, David Karger, Frans Kaashoek, and Hari Balakrishnan, and was developed at MIT. The 2001 Chord paper won an ACM SIGCOMM Test of Time award in 2011.

Subsequent research by Pamela Zave has shown that the original Chord algorithm (as specified in the 2001 SIGCOMM paper, the 2001 Technical report,
the 2002 PODC paper, and
the 2003 TON paper
) can mis-order the ring, produce several rings, and break the ring.

==Overview==

Nodes and keys are assigned an formula_1-bit &quot;identifier&quot; using &quot;consistent hashing&quot;. The SHA-1 algorithm is the base hashing function for consistent hashing. Consistent hashing is integral to the robustness and performance of Chord because both keys and nodes (in fact, their IP addresses) are uniformly distributed in the same identifier space with a negligible possibility of collision. Thus, it also allows nodes to join and leave the network without disruption. In the protocol, the term &quot;node&quot; is used to refer to both a node itself and its identifier (ID) without ambiguity. So is the term &quot;key&quot;.

Using the Chord lookup protocol, nodes and keys are arranged in an identifier circle that has at most formula_2 nodes, ranging from formula_3 to formula_4. (formula_1 should be large enough to avoid collision.) Some of these nodes will map to machines or keys while others (most) will be empty.

Each node has a &quot;successor&quot; and a &quot;predecessor&quot;. The successor to a node is the next node in the identifier circle in a clockwise direction. The predecessor is counter-clockwise. If there is a node for each possible ID, the successor of node 0 is node 1, and the predecessor of node 0 is node formula_4; however, normally there are &quot;holes&quot; in the sequence. For example, the successor of node 153 may be node 167 (and nodes from 154 to 166 do not exist); in this case, the predecessor of node 167 will be node 153.

The concept of successor can be used for keys as well. The &quot;successor node&quot; of a key formula_7 is the first node whose ID equals to formula_7 or follows formula_7 in the identifier circle, denoted by formula_10. Every key is assigned to (stored at) its successor node, so looking up a key formula_7 is to query formula_10.

Since the successor (or predecessor) of a node may disappear from the network (because of failure or departure), each node records an arc of formula_13 nodes in the middle of which it stands, i.e., the list of formula_14 nodes preceding it and formula_14 nodes following it. This list results in a high probability that a node is able to correctly locate its successor or predecessor, even if the network in question suffers from a high failure rate.

==Protocol details==
===Basic query===
The core usage of the Chord protocol is to query a key from a client (generally a node as well), i.e. to find formula_10. The basic approach is to pass the query to a node&#x27;s successor, if it cannot find the key locally. This will lead to a formula_17 query time where formula_18 is the number of machines in the ring.

===Finger table===
To avoid the linear search above, Chord implements a faster search method by requiring each node to keep a &quot;finger table&quot; containing up to formula_1 entries, recall that formula_1 is the number of bits in the hash key. The formula_21 entry of node formula_22 will contain formula_23. The first entry of finger table is actually the node&#x27;s immediate successor (and therefore an extra successor field is not needed). Every time a node wants to look up a key formula_7, it will pass the query to the closest successor or predecessor (depending on the finger table) of formula_7 in its finger table (the &quot;largest&quot; one on the circle whose ID is smaller than formula_7), until a node finds out the key is stored in its immediate successor.

With such a finger table, the number of nodes that must be contacted to find a successor in an &quot;N&quot;-node network is formula_27. (See proof below.)

===Node join===
Whenever a new node joins, three invariants should be maintained (the first two ensure correctness and the last one keeps querying fast):
# Each node&#x27;s successor points to its immediate successor correctly.
# Each key is stored in formula_10.
# Each node&#x27;s finger table should be correct.

To satisfy these invariants, a &quot;predecessor&quot; field is maintained for each node. As the successor is the first entry of the finger table, we do not need to maintain this field separately any more. The following tasks should be done for a newly joined node formula_22:
# Initialize node formula_22 (the predecessor and the finger table).
# Notify other nodes to update their predecessors and finger tables.
# The new node takes over its responsible keys from its successor.

The predecessor of formula_22 can be easily obtained from the predecessor of formula_32 (in the previous circle). As for its finger table, there are various initialization methods. The simplest one is to execute find successor queries for all formula_1 entries, resulting in formula_34 initialization time. A better method is to check whether formula_21 entry in the finger table is still correct for the formula_36 entry. This will lead to formula_37. The best method is to initialize the finger table from its immediate neighbours and make some updates, which is formula_27.

===Stabilization===
To ensure correct lookups, all successor pointers must be up to date. Therefore, a stabilization protocol is running periodically in the background which updates finger tables and successor pointers.

The stabilization protocol works as follows:
* Stabilize(): &quot;n&quot; asks its successor for its predecessor &quot;p&quot; and decides whether p should be &quot;n&quot;&#x27;s successor instead (this is the case if &quot;p&quot; recently joined the system).
* Notify(): notifies &quot;n&quot;&#x27;s successor of its existence, so it can change its predecessor to &quot;n&quot;
* Fix_fingers(): updates finger tables

==Potential uses==
*Cooperative Mirroring: A load balancing mechanism by a local network hosting information available to computers outside of the local network. This scheme could allow developers to balance the load between many computers instead of a central server to ensure availability of their product.
*Time-shared storage: In a network, once a computer joins the network its available data is distributed throughout the network for retrieval when that computer disconnects from the network. As well as other computers&#x27; data is sent to the computer in question for offline retrieval when they are no longer connected to the network. Mainly for nodes without the ability to connect full-time to the network.
*Distributed Indices: Retrieval of files over the network within a searchable database. e.g. P2P file transfer clients.
*Large scale combinatorial searches: Keys being candidate solutions to a problem and each key mapping to the node, or computer, that is responsible for evaluating them as a solution or not. e.g. Code Breaking
*Also used in wireless sensor networks for reliability

==Proof sketches==

With high probability, Chord contacts formula_27 nodes to find a successor in an formula_18-node network.

Suppose node formula_22 wishes to find the successor of key formula_7. Let formula_43 be the predecessor of formula_7. We wish to find an upper bound for the number of steps it takes for a message to be routed from formula_22 to formula_43. Node formula_22 will examine its finger table and route the request to the closest predecessor of formula_7 that it has. Call this node formula_49. If formula_49 is the formula_21 entry in formula_22&#x27;s finger table, then both formula_49 and formula_43 are at distances between formula_55 and formula_56 from formula_22 along the identifier circle. Hence, the distance between formula_49 and formula_43 along this circle is at most formula_55. Thus the distance from formula_49 to formula_43 is less than the distance from formula_22 to formula_49: the new distance to formula_43 is at most half the initial distance.

This process of halving the remaining distance repeats itself, so after formula_66 steps, the distance remaining to formula_43 is at most formula_68; in particular, after formula_69 steps, the remaining distance is at most formula_70. Because nodes are distributed uniformly at random along the identifier circle, the expected number of nodes falling within an interval of this length is 1, and with high probability, there are fewer than formula_69 such nodes. Because the message always advances by at least one node, it takes at most formula_72 steps for a message to traverse this remaining distance. The total expected routing time is thus formula_27.

If Chord keeps track of formula_74 predecessors/successors, then with high probability, if each node has probability of 1/4 of failing, find_successor (see below) and find_predecessor (see below) will return the correct nodes

Simply, the probability that all formula_14 nodes fail is formula_76, which is a low probability; so with high probability at least one of them is alive and the node will have the correct pointer.

==Pseudocode==
;Definitions for pseudocode
:;finger[k]: first node that succeeds formula_77
:;successor: the next node from the node in question on the identifier ring
:;predecessor: the previous node from the node in question on the identifier ring

The pseudocode to find the &quot;successor&quot; node of an id is given below:

 &quot;// ask node n to find the successor of id&quot;
 n.find_successor(id)
 &quot;// Yes, that should be a closing square bracket to match the opening parenthesis.&quot;
 &quot;// It is a half closed interval.&quot;
 if id ∈ (n, successor] then
 return successor
 else
 // forward the query around the circle
 n0 := closest_preceding_node(id)
 return n0.find_successor(id)
 &quot;// search the local table for the highest predecessor of id&quot;
 n.closest_preceding_node(id)
 for i = m downto 1 do
 if (finger[i] ∈ (n, id)) then
 return finger[i]
 return n

The pseudocode to stabilize the chord ring/circle after node joins and departures is as follows:

 &quot;// create a new Chord ring.&quot;
 n.create()
 predecessor := nil
 successor := n
 &quot;// join a Chord ring containing node n&#x27;.&quot;
 n.join(n&#x27;)
 predecessor := nil
 successor := n&#x27;.find_successor(n)
 &quot;// called periodically. n asks the successor&quot;
 &quot;// about its predecessor, verifies if n&#x27;s immediate&quot;
 &quot;// successor is consistent, and tells the successor about n&quot;
 n.stabilize()
 x = successor.predecessor
 if x ∈ (n, successor) then
 successor := x
 successor.notify(n)
 &quot;// n&#x27; thinks it might be our predecessor.&quot;
 n.notify(n&#x27;)
 if predecessor is nil or n&#x27;∈(predecessor, n) then
 predecessor := n&#x27;
 &quot;// called periodically. refreshes finger table entries.&quot;
 &quot;// next stores the index of the finger to fix&quot;
 n.fix_fingers()
 next := next + 1
 if next &gt; m then
 next := 1
 finger[next] := find_successor(n+2);
 &quot;// called periodically. checks whether predecessor has failed.&quot;
 n.check_predecessor()
 if predecessor has failed then
 predecessor := nil

<doc id="322138" wikidata="Q315408" url="?curid=322138" title="Peter Green (musician)">
<text>Peter Allen Greenbaum (29 October 194625 July 2020), known professionally as Peter Green, was an English blues rock singer-songwriter and guitarist. Green founded Fleetwood Mac in 1967 after a stint in John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers and quickly established the new band as a popular live act in addition to a successful recording act, before departing in 1970. Green&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Albatross&quot;, &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;, &quot;Oh Well&quot;, &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)&quot; and &quot;Man of the World&quot;, appeared on singles charts, and several have been adapted by a variety of musicians.

Green was a major figure in the &quot;second great epoch&quot; of the British blues movement. Eric Clapton praised his guitar playing, and B.B. King commented, &quot;He has the sweetest tone I ever heard; he was the only one who gave me the cold sweats.&quot; His trademark sound included string bending, vibrato, emotionally expressive tone, and economy of style.

In June 1996, Green was voted the third-best guitarist of all time in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him at number 58 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Green&#x27;s tone on the instrumental &quot;The Supernatural&quot; was rated as one of the 50 greatest of all time by &quot;Guitar Player&quot; in 2004.

==Biography==
===1946–1965: Early life and career===
Peter Allen Greenbaum was born in Bethnal Green, London, on 29 October 1946, into a Jewish family, the youngest of Joe and Ann Greenbaum&#x27;s four children. His brother, Michael, taught him his first guitar chords and by the age of 11, Green was teaching himself. He began playing professionally by the age of 15, while working for a number of east London shipping companies. He first played bass guitar in a band called Bobby Dennis and the Dominoes, which performed pop chart covers and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll standards, including Shadows covers. He later stated that Hank Marvin was his guitar hero and he played the Shadows&#x27; song &quot;Midnight&quot; on the 1996 tribute album &quot;Twang&quot;. He went on to join a rhythm and blues outfit, the Muskrats, then a band called the Tridents in which he played bass. By Christmas 1965, Green was playing lead guitar in Peter Bardens&#x27; band &quot;Peter B&#x27;s Looners&quot;, where he met drummer Mick Fleetwood. It was with Peter B&#x27;s Looners that he made his recording début with the single &quot;If You Wanna Be Happy&quot; with &quot;Jodrell Blues&quot; as a B-side. His recording of &quot;If You Wanna Be Happy&quot; was an instrumental cover of a song by Jimmy Soul. In 1966, Green and some other members of Peter B&#x27;s Looners formed another act, Shotgun Express, a Motown-style soul band which also included Rod Stewart, but Green left the group after a few months.

===1966–1967: John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers===
In October 1965, before joining Bardens&#x27; group, Green had the opportunity to fill in for Eric Clapton in John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers for four gigs. Soon afterwards, when Clapton left the Bluesbreakers, Green became a full-time member of Mayall&#x27;s band from July 1966.

Mike Vernon, a producer at Decca Records recalls Green&#x27;s début with the Bluesbreakers:

Green made his recording debut with the Bluesbreakers in 1966 on the album &quot;A Hard Road&quot; (1967), which featured two of his own compositions, &quot;The Same Way&quot; and &quot;The Supernatural&quot;. The latter was one of Green&#x27;s first instrumentals, which would soon become a trademark. So proficient was he that his musician friends bestowed upon him the nickname &quot;The Green God,&quot; itself a reference to Eric Clapton&#x27;s nickname &quot;God&quot;. In 1967, Green decided to form his own blues band and left the Bluesbreakers. Green attributed this decision to his dissatisfaction with the musical direction of the Bluesbreakers, which he believed was veering away from blues music.

===1967–1970: Fleetwood Mac===

Green&#x27;s new band, with former Bluesbreaker Mick Fleetwood on drums and Jeremy Spencer on guitar, was initially called &quot;Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer&quot;. Bob Brunning was temporarily employed on bass guitar (Green&#x27;s first choice, Bluesbreakers&#x27; bassist John McVie, was not yet ready to join the band). Within a month they played at the Windsor National Jazz and Blues Festival in August 1967, and were quickly signed to Mike Vernon&#x27;s Blue Horizon label. Their repertoire consisted mainly of blues covers and originals, mostly written by Green, but some were written by slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer. The band&#x27;s first single, Spencer&#x27;s &quot;I Believe My Time Ain&#x27;t Long&quot; with Green&#x27;s &quot;Rambling Pony&quot; as a B-side, did not chart but their eponymous debut album made a significant impression, remaining in the British charts for 37 weeks. By September 1967, John McVie had replaced Brunning.

Although classic blues covers and blues-styled originals remained prominent in the band&#x27;s repertoire through this period, Green rapidly blossomed as a songwriter and contributed many successful original compositions from 1968 onwards. The songs chosen for single release showed Green&#x27;s style gradually moving away from the group&#x27;s blues roots into new musical territory. Their second studio album, &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;, was released in 1968 and continued the formula of the first album. In the same year they scored a hit with Green&#x27;s &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; (later covered by Santana), followed by the guitar instrumental &quot;Albatross&quot; (1969), which featured new band member 18-year-old Danny Kirwan and reached number one in the British singles charts. More hits written by Green followed, including &quot;Oh Well&quot;, &quot;Man of the World&quot; (both 1969) and the ominous &quot;The Green Manalishi&quot; (1970). The double album &quot;Blues Jam in Chicago&quot; (1969) was recorded at the Chess Records Ter-Mar Studio in Chicago. There, under the joint supervision of Vernon and Marshall Chess, they recorded with some of their American blues heroes including Otis Spann, Big Walter Horton, Willie Dixon, J. T. Brown and Buddy Guy.

In 1969, after signing to Immediate Records for one single (&quot;Man of the World&quot;, prior to that label&#x27;s collapse) the group signed with Warner Bros. Records&#x27; Reprise Records label and recorded their third studio album, &quot;Then Play On&quot;, which prominently featured new third guitarist and songwriter Kirwan. Green had first seen Kirwan in 1967 playing with his blues trio Boilerhouse, with Trevor Stevens on bass and Dave Terrey on drums. Green was impressed with Kirwan&#x27;s playing and used the band as a support act for Fleetwood Mac, before recruiting Kirwan to his own band in 1968 at the suggestion of Mick Fleetwood.

Beginning with the melancholy lyric of &quot;Man of the World&quot;, Green&#x27;s bandmates began to notice changes in his state of mind. He began taking large doses of LSD, grew a beard and began to wear robes and a crucifix. Mick Fleetwood recalls Green becoming concerned about accumulating wealth: &quot;I had conversations with Peter Green around that time and he was obsessive about us not making money, wanting us to give it all away.&quot;

While touring Europe in late March 1970, Green took LSD at a party at a commune near Munich, an incident cited by Fleetwood Mac manager Clifford Davis as the crucial point in his mental decline. Communard Rainer Langhans mentions in his autobiography that he and Uschi Obermaier met Green in Munich and invited him to their &quot;Highfisch-Kommune&quot;. Fleetwood Mac roadie Dinky Dawson remembers that Green went to the party with another roadie, Dennis Keane, and that when Keane returned to the band&#x27;s hotel to explain that Green would not leave the commune, Keane, Dawson and Mick Fleetwood travelled there to fetch him. By contrast, Green stated in 2009 that he had fond memories of jamming at the commune. &quot;I had a good play there, it was great, someone recorded it, they gave me a tape. There were people playing along, a few of us just fooling around and it was... yeah it was great.&quot; He told Jeremy Spencer at the time &quot;That&#x27;s the most spiritual music I&#x27;ve ever recorded in my life.&quot; After a final performance on 20 May 1970, Green left Fleetwood Mac.

===1970–1973: After Fleetwood Mac===
On 27 June 1970 Green appeared at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music with John Mayall, Rod Mayall (organ), Ric Grech (bass) and Aynsley Dunbar (drums). In that same year he recorded a jam session with drummer Godfrey Maclean, keyboardists Zoot Money and Nick Buck, and bassist Alex Dmochowski of The Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation; Reprise Records released the session as &quot;The End of the Game&quot;, Green&#x27;s first post-Fleetwood Mac solo album. Also soon after leaving Fleetwood Mac, Green accompanied former bandmate keyboardist Peter Bardens (of Peter B&#x27;s Looners) on Bardens&#x27; solo LP &quot;The Answer&quot;, playing lead guitar on several tracks. In 1971, he had a brief reunion with Fleetwood Mac, helping them to complete a U.S. tour after guitarist Jeremy Spencer had left the group, performing under the pseudonym Peter Blue. He recorded two tracks for the album &quot;Juju&quot; with Bobby Tench&#x27;s band Gass, followed by a solo single, one with Nigel Watson, sessions with &quot;B.B. King in London&quot; in 1971 and an uncredited appearance on Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Penguin&quot; LP in 1973, on the song &quot;Night Watch&quot;. At this time, Green&#x27;s mental illness and drug use had become entrenched and he faded into professional obscurity.

===1974–2009: Illness and first re-emergence===
Green was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia and spent time in psychiatric hospitals undergoing electroconvulsive therapy during the mid-1970s. Many sources attest to his lethargic, trancelike state during this period. In 1977, Green was arrested for threatening his accountant David Simmons with a shotgun. The exact circumstances are the subject of much speculation, the most famous being that Green wanted Simmons to stop sending money to him. In the 2011 BBC documentary &quot;Peter Green: Man of the World&quot;, Green stated that at the time he had just returned from Canada needing money and that, during a telephone conversation with his accounts manager, he alluded to the fact that he had brought back a gun from his travels. His accounts manager promptly called the police, who surrounded Green&#x27;s house.

In 1979, Green began to re-emerge professionally. With the help of his brother Michael, he was signed to Peter Vernon-Kell&#x27;s PVK label, and produced a string of solo albums starting with 1979&#x27;s &quot;In the Skies&quot;. He also made an uncredited appearance on Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s double album &quot;Tusk&quot;, on the song &quot;Brown Eyes&quot;, released the same year.

In 1981, Green contributed to &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; and &quot;Super Brains&quot; on Mick Fleetwood&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Visitor&quot;. He recorded various sessions with a number of other musicians notably the Katmandu album &quot;A Case for the Blues&quot; with Ray Dorset of Mungo Jerry, Vincent Crane from The Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Len Surtees of The Nashville Teens. Despite attempts by Gibson Guitar Corporation to start talks about producing a &quot;Peter Green signature Les Paul&quot; guitar, Green&#x27;s instrument of choice at this time was a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion guitar. In 1986, Peter and his brother Micky contributed to the album &quot;A Touch of Sunburn&quot; by Lawrie &#x27;The Raven&#x27; Gaines (under the group name &#x27;The Enemy Within&#x27;). This album has been reissued many times under such titles as &quot;Post Modern Blues&quot; and &quot;Peter Green and Mick Green – Two Greens Make a Blues&quot;, often crediting Pirates guitarist Mick Green.

In 1988 Green was quoted as saying: &quot;I&#x27;m at present recuperating from treatment for taking drugs. It was drugs that influenced me a lot. I took more than I intended to. I took LSD eight or nine times. The effect of that stuff lasts so long ... I wanted to give away all my money ... I went kind of holy – no, not holy, religious. I thought I could do it, I thought I was all right on drugs. My failing!&quot;

Along with the other members of Fleetwood Mac, Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. In the early 2000s there were rumours of a reunion of the early line-up of Fleetwood Mac, involving Green and Jeremy Spencer. The two guitarists and vocalists were apparently unconvinced of the merits of such a project, but in April 2006, during a question-and-answer session on the &quot;Penguin&quot; Fleetwood Mac fan website, bassist John McVie said of the reunion idea:

In May 2009, Green was the subject of the BBC Four documentary &quot;Peter Green: Man of the World&quot; produced by Henry Hadaway. On 25 February 2020 an all-star tribute concert was performed at the London Palladium, billed as &quot;Mick Fleetwood and Friends Tribute to Peter Green&quot;. The &quot;Guitar World&quot; review said that Green was not in attendance and possibly unaware of the event.

===1997–2009: Peter Green Splinter Group===
Green formed the Peter Green Splinter Group in the late 1990s, with the assistance of Nigel Watson and Cozy Powell. The group released nine blues albums, mostly written by Watson, between 1997 and 2004. Early in 2004, a tour was cancelled and the recording of a new studio album stopped when Green left the band and moved to Sweden. Shortly thereafter he signed on to a tour with the British Blues All Stars scheduled for the following year. In February 2009, Green began playing and touring again, this time as Peter Green and Friends.

==Musical style==
Robin Denselow in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Green as being &quot;interested in expressing emotion in his songs, rather than showing off how fast he could play&quot;. He has been praised for his swinging shuffle grooves and soulful phrases and favoured the minor mode and its darker blues implications. His distinct tone can be heard on &quot;The Supernatural&quot;, an instrumental written by Green for John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers&#x27; 1967 album &quot;A Hard Road&quot;. This song demonstrates Green&#x27;s control of harmonic feedback. The sound is characterised by a shivering vibrato, clean cutting tones, and a series of ten-second sustained notes. These tones were achieved by Green controlling feedback on a Les Paul guitar.

==Equipment==
Early in his career, Green played a Harmony Meteor, an inexpensive hollow-body guitar. He began playing a Gibson Les Paul with the Peter B&#x27;s, a guitar which was often referred to as his &quot;magic guitar&quot;. Though he played other guitars, he is best known for deriving a unique tone from his 1959 Les Paul. Green later sold it to Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore for all the money Moore could get by selling his Gibson SG guitar. Green had bought the guitar after his first spell with Mayall but before joining the Peter B&#x27;s, for £114 from Selmers in Charing Cross Road. In 2014, Kirk Hammett of Metallica bought the guitar. Hammett has stated that he paid quite a bit less than $1m for it, being in the right place when the guy who was selling it needed some cash.

In the 1990s, Green played a 1960s Fender Stratocaster and a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion model, using Fender Blues DeVille and Vox AC30 amplifiers. Towards the very end of his playing days, the Gibson ES-165 saw more use.

By the time of his death, Green had accumulated more than 150 electric and acoustic guitars and other instruments. They were sold at auction by Bonhams of London in June 2023. The sale also included amps and equipment, programmes, records, letters, sketchbooks, and handwritten lyrics. A 1968 Gretsch White Falcon semi-acoustic and a 1931 National Duolian Resonator each sold for £38,400, and a 1999 Fender Strat USA Custom Shop relic guitar fetched £23,040. Green&#x27;s handwritten lyrics of &quot;Man of the World&quot; were expected to fetch between £40,000 and £60,000. Some of the instruments were exhibited at the Guitar Show in Birmingham in February 2023.

==Influence and legacy==
Many rock guitarists have cited Green as an influence, including Gary Moore, Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Andy Powell of Wishbone Ash, and more recently, Mark Knopfler, Noel Gallagher, and Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood.
Green was The Black Crowes&#x27; Rich Robinson&#x27;s pick in &quot;Guitar World&quot; &quot;30 on 30: The Greatest Guitarists Picked by the Greatest Guitarists&quot; (2010). In the same article Robinson cites Jimmy Page, with whom the Crowes toured: &quot;he told us so many Peter Green stories. It was clear that Jimmy loves the man&#x27;s talent&quot;.
Green&#x27;s songs have been recorded by artists such as Santana, Aerosmith, Status Quo, The Black Crowes, Midge Ure, Tom Petty, Judas Priest, and Gary Moore, who recorded &quot;Blues for Greeny&quot;, an album of Green compositions. In 1995, the tribute album &quot;Rattlesnake Guitar: The Music of Peter Green&quot; was released, and subsequently was reissued in 2000 as &quot;Peter Green Songbook&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Green married Jane Samuels in January 1978; the couple divorced in 1979. They had a daughter.

Enduring periods of mental illness and destitution throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Green moved in with his older brother Len and Len&#x27;s wife Gloria, and his mother in their house in Gorleston near Great Yarmouth, where a process of recovery began.

He lived for a period on Canvey Island, Essex, where he died in his sleep on 25 July 2020 at the age of 73.

<doc id="322139" wikidata="Q2066628" url="?curid=322139" title="Eve (American TV series)">
<text>Eve is an American television sitcom created by Meg DeLoatch that originally aired for three seasons on UPN from September 15, 2003, to May 11, 2006. Featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Eve, Jason George, Ali Landry, Natalie Desselle-Reid, Brian Hooks, and Sean Maguire, the show revolves around two sets of male and female friends attempting to navigate relationships with the opposite sex. The executive producers were Robert Greenblatt and David Janollari; the series was produced by The Greenblatt/Janollari Studio and Mega Diva Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Television for UPN.

The series was developed as a vehicle for Eve under the working title &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot;; UPN executives approached the rapper about a television project after the success of fellow musician Brandy in another of the network&#x27;s sitcoms, &quot;Moesha&quot;. Eve&#x27;s series was created as part of the network&#x27;s attempt to appeal to a younger demographic. After being picked up, the show was renamed &quot;Eve&quot; to attract the rapper&#x27;s fans. It was set in Miami, but filmed at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood. Eve has stated that she was intimidated at first by the process of preparing for and filming a sitcom, and she would later regret not fully committing to her character. The show aired on UPN in its original run, and later in syndicated reruns on TV One and Cleo TV. UPN had promoted &quot;Eve&quot; as part of its new comedy block, one of four new comedies developed by the network.

&quot;Eve&quot; suffered low viewership in spite of its high ratings among young African-American women; it was canceled following UPN&#x27;s merger with The WB Television Network (The WB) to launch The CW in 2006. The series&#x27; cancellation, along with that of other black sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African-American characters and the number of roles for African-American actors on television. Critical response to &quot;Eve&quot; was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN&#x27;s line-up of black sitcoms, but others felt Eve lacked charisma, and that the series was inferior to its contemporaries. Despite the mixed reception, the show and its star received several award nominations. The series was later released on the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, and HBO Max.

== Premise and characters ==
&quot;Eve&quot; revolves around Miami fashion designer Shelly Williams (Eve), &quot;a woman whose fashion career is on the move but whose love life is a work in progress&quot;. At the start of the series, Shelly has been unable to find a suitable partner for ten months. She begins an on and off relationship with physical therapist Jeremiah Thurgood &quot;J.T.&quot; Hunter (Jason George), which is nearly derailed when he cries while they watch &quot;Casablanca&quot; on their first date. Both characters turn to two of their close friends for advice on the opposite sex, love, and relationships. Shelly frequently looks for advice from former model Rita Lefleur (Ali Landry) and married friend Janie Egins (Natalie Desselle-Reid), while J.T. finds support in his best friends, nightclub manager Donovan Brink (Sean Maguire), and IRS worker Nick Dalaney (Brian Hooks).

Episodes typically depict the friends&#x27; comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Shelly, Rita, and Janie working together at their Miami-based fashion boutique DivaStyle, and J.T. applying to colleges. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, and the series can be viewed as an extension of the concept of &quot;the battle of the sexes&quot; for its equal representation of both male and female viewpoints on the matter. Janie serves as Shelly&#x27;s voice of reason, while Rita encourages her to be more impulsive with dating. They often disagree with one another on the best way for Shelly to approach her love life. Rita, Janie, Nick, and Donovan are typically shown caught in the middle of Shelly and J.T.&#x27;s miscommunications.

Even though Shelly and J.T.&#x27;s relationship is the predominant storyline, the series does explore the relationships of its supporting cast; Donovan and Rita date each other, and the quite-selective Nick attempts to find the perfect partner. Donovan owns the Z Lounge, which is described as &quot;one of Miami&#x27;s hottest clubs&quot; and serves as one of the places where the group often meets. Other frequently recurring characters include Shelly&#x27;s younger love interest Grant (Sharif Atkins), Janie&#x27;s husband Marty (Reggie Gaskins), and Shelly&#x27;s mother Beverly (Penny Johnson Jerald). Several celebrities also make cameo appearances on the show, including Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, Brooke Burke, Vivica A. Fox, Morris Day, Antonio Fargas and Cedric the Entertainer.

== Episodes ==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Season 1 ===
The first season introduces the six main characters: Shelly, J.T., Rita, Janie, Nick, and Donovan. Shelly runs the fashion boutique DivaStyle with her friends Janie and Rita. She pursues a relationship with J.T., only to discover he is afraid of commitment and exhibits some chauvinistic behavior. Their relationship is often tested by frequent misunderstandings. Nick wants to find his ideal partner, but his attempts are typically thwarted as he is very particular about women. Even though his relationship with a woman named Dani appears to be successful, they soon break up. Donovan finds himself romantically attracted to Rita, but he resists the temptation out of fear of ruining their friendship.

=== Season 2 ===
Shelly and J.T. break up at the beginning of the second season and pursue a friends with benefits relationship. After discovering that she is bankrupt, Rita moves in with Janie to save money. She also begins a relationship with Donovan. When Janie becomes annoyed with Rita for staying at her home for an extended period, Rita persuades J.T. and Nick to let her stay with them instead. Shelly finds herself attracted to a younger man, and J.T. becomes jealous, realizing that he is in love with her. In the season finale, both men propose to Shelly. At the same time, Donovan&#x27;s application for residency is rejected, and the friends prepare for his return to England.

=== Season 3 ===
In the third-season premiere, Shelly accepts J.T.&#x27;s marriage proposal. Donovan gets a work visa after finding a job selling makeup products for a British company. Shelly and J.T. break up again, resolving to remain just friends. J.T. pursues a career in medicine and enrolls in the Miami State Medical School. He finds out that college is more difficult than he&#x27;d expected, and struggles with his classes and finances. During the spring, Rita and Donovan rekindle their relationship, and she buys her own apartment. In the series finale, Beverly finally admits to Yusef, Shelly&#x27;s father, that she is carrying his child; Shelly questions his ability to be a father again. The series ends in a cliffhanger, with Janie, Rita, and Donovan arrested for illegally selling BOTOX at DivaStyle.

== Background ==

=== Conception ===

United Paramount Network (UPN) executives approached Eve about developing a television project following her performance of her rap single &quot;Gangsta Lovin&#x27;&quot; (2002) at an event marking the channel&#x27;s 2002 season premieres. The network had pitched the idea to her prior to her appearances in the 2002 films &quot;XXX&quot; and &quot;Barbershop&quot;. Following their release, UPN renewed its interest in pursuing a series with Eve. She had developed the main premise behind the sitcom, in which she would star as a fashion designer with a supporting multi-ethnic ensemble. The show&#x27;s creation was credited to television producer Meg DeLoatch. UPN executives designed the series as a vehicle for Eve following the positive response to fellow musician Brandy in another UPN sitcom, &quot;Moesha&quot;.

Eve accepted the role as a way to showcase a different side of her personality that was unexplored in her music. Her co-star Jason George commented that the show allowed the audience to see Eve as more than a hardcore rap artist, saying: &quot;The part that people know the least about her comes across most in this show: There&#x27;s a seriously girlie girl side to her.&quot; DeLoach emphasized the difference between Eve and her character Shelly Williams by saying, &quot;She&#x27;s bringing so much of herself to the role of Shelly but she&#x27;s playing a character. Some of the things Shelly does aren&#x27;t necessarily what Eve would do.&quot; To further distinguish herself as an actor, Eve decided against performing the show&#x27;s theme song.

Publicized as the &quot;Untitled Eve Project&quot; in an early press release, the series had the working title &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; before it was changed to reflect Eve&#x27;s status as the star. She initially resisted the change and felt that &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; was a stronger choice, but described it as a &quot;corporate decision.&quot; According to her, UPN executives explained that the title would better attract the rapper&#x27;s fans. They also felt that the audience would not be confused by the title &quot;Eve&quot;, despite Eve playing a character named Shelly. After the title was established, the show&#x27;s premise was modified slightly, but remained centered around male and female friends discussing their love lives, and navigating their relationships with the opposite sex. While Eve described the series as &quot;the PG version of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;&quot;, DeLoatch promoted &quot;Eve&quot; as unique for incorporating both male and female perspectives on dating and love. She further described the sitcom as &quot;focus[ing] on one relationship and follow[ing] all of the ups and downs in it,&quot; with the purpose of &quot;showing the male and female points of view.&quot; To achieve this goal, DeLoatch included male writers in the discussions of potential episodes and storylines to get their input.

=== Production and filming ===
Production was handled by The Greenblatt/Janollari Studio, Mega Diva Inc, and Warner Bros. Television. Robert Greenblatt and David Janollari served as the series&#x27; executive producers. DeLoatch, Troy Carter, David Duclon, and Eve also contributed to the series as co-executive producers. Rapper Missy Elliott wrote and performed the theme song, which was produced by Soul Diggaz. &quot;Eve&quot; was one of four new comedies developed by UPN for the 2003–04 television season, as part of a &quot;new comedy block&quot; including &quot;All of Us&quot;, &quot;Rock Me Baby,&quot; and &quot;The Mullets&quot;. A writer from &quot;Today&quot; described UPN&#x27;s enlistment of Eve into a comedy as an example of the network&#x27;s attempt to form its own identity through targeting a younger, multi-ethnic audience. In his book &quot;TV-a-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol&quot;, Jake Austen identified &quot;Eve&quot; as part of a trend in which musicians were prominently featured as the stars of television programs; he cited Brandy&#x27;s role in &quot;Moesha&quot; and Queen Latifah on &quot;Living Single&quot; as two other examples.

By the time the series was officially announced during UPN&#x27;s broadcast upfront presentations, Ali Landry, Natalie Desselle-Reid, and Brian Hooks were confirmed in the roles of Rita, Janie, and Nick, respectively. Bumper Robinson was originally slated to portray J.T., but was replaced by Jason George for undisclosed reasons. The role of Donovan was also recast, with original actor Eddie McClintock removed in favor of Sean Maguire. The supporting cast of Landry, Desselle-Reid, Hooks, and Maguire were described by Tom Jicha of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; as &quot;peripheral,&quot; since they were written to &quot;servic[e] the highs and lows of the romance between Shelly and J.T.&quot; With Shelly and J.T.&#x27;s relationship as the heart of the sitcom, Janollari expressed hopes that the episodes would follow them &quot;from their meeting in the pilot, through the steps of a normal relationship, all the way, hopefully to marriage.&quot; In 2006, TV One began broadcasting the series as part of an agreement with Warner Bros. Domestic Cable Distribution. Along with &quot;All of Us&quot;, &quot;Eve&quot; marked the first time in which the channel acquired the rights for shows that were currently airing on network television. Cleo TV included syndicated reruns of &quot;Eve&quot; in 2019.

Even though the show was set in Miami, filming took place at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood. Stock exterior shots of Miami were used for the opening credits and transitions between scenes. The series was filmed with a multiple-camera setup, with each episode running 20 to 22 minutes, excluding commercials. Eve said she was initially intimidated by the amount of work required to prepare for and film a television series. During an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, she explained that while filming the first season she felt like she &quot;just wanted to leave because there was so much to learn, it&#x27;s just a different world&quot;. Since she found comedy to be challenging due to the &quot;certain beats you have to learn,&quot; Eve hired two acting coaches to help improve her timing. One of her coaches was Chip Fields, who visited the show&#x27;s set to offer Eve acting advice. During the development of the second season, Eve viewed the set as her home, and felt the process was easier, having grown closer to the cast and crew. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Grazia&quot;, she revealed her regret at not fully committing herself to her character and the series. She explained: &quot;I was the youngest person on set, and was clubbing in between being on set and learning my lines. I look back and wish I was more dedicated. But I learned from it.&quot;

=== Cancellation ===
The show, as well as a majority of UPN&#x27;s programs, was officially canceled when the network merged with The WB Television Network (The WB) to form The CW in 2006. Fern Gillespie of &quot;The Crisis&quot; was critical of UPN&#x27;s decision to cancel the series given how the network, &quot;in one swoop, wiped out five of its eight African-American comedies&quot; with the creation of The CW. Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the three major networks, saying: &quot;Without that opportunity for some of the younger artists to hone and develop their skills, it will potentially have a generational impact.&quot; IndieWire&#x27;s Dara T. Mathis identified &quot;Eve&quot; as an example of UPN&#x27;s notable black sitcoms, and equated the cancellations of a majority of UPN&#x27;s comedies as a sign that the genre was in a state of decline. Critic Tim Goodman noted that &quot;Eve&quot; was one of six shows &quot;geared for an African-American audience,&quot; featuring &quot;an African-American lead actress,&quot; that were canceled during the merger. He viewed these cancellations as a sign of networks &quot;eliminat[ing] niche programming&quot;. Julian Kimble of &quot;Complex&quot; included &quot;Eve&quot; on a list of programs that &quot;are often forgotten about,&quot; alongside other UPN sitcoms &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot; and &quot;All of Us&quot;. The series has not been made available on Blu-ray or DVD, but it was released on the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, and HBO Max.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Eve&quot; has received mixed feedback since its first broadcast. Melanie McFarland of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; praised the changes made during the show&#x27;s development, and highlighted Maguire as the standout. In reference to its transformation from the pilot, she described &quot;Eve&quot; as the &quot;Eliza Doolittle of UPN comedies.&quot; The supporting cast was praised by David Hinckely of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, who wrote that they &quot;form an entertaining and appropriately neurotic chorus behind Eve&#x27;s relationship dance.&quot; &quot;Eve&quot; was compared to the UPN comedy &quot;Girlfriends&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Alessandra Stanley, who regarded Eve as an appropriate lead with &quot;an appealingly tough edge that matches the paw-print tattoos on her chest.&quot; Brian Josephs of &quot;Spin&quot; shared positive memories of African-American television shows on UPN, identifying Monday nights on the network as the place &quot;where Eve transformed from Ruff Ryder to sitcom actress.&quot; &quot;Eve&quot; was listed by scholar Jake Austen as one of the shows &quot;that emerged in the wake of the civil rights era&quot; that served as &quot;a dynamic showcase for black creativity.&quot; Tom Jicha provided a less enthusiastic review, stating that &quot;Eve&quot; was &quot;just another cookie-cutter sitcom.&quot;

&quot;Eve&quot; drew criticism for its formulaic writing and the lead&#x27;s performance. The show was included on a list by &quot;Ebony&quot;&#x27;s Kevin L. Clark profiling the top ten worst black television shows of all time. Clark was critical of the episodes&#x27; titles, such as &quot;Condom Mania,&quot; &quot;She Snoops to Conquer,&quot; and &quot;Porn Free,&quot; and wrote that they indicated an overuse of &quot;outrageous clichés that boob-tube audiences would come to know and love once reality TV hit its boon.&quot; Arianna Davis of Refinery29 negatively compared &quot;Eve&quot; to 1990s black sitcoms, and determined that it was a part of the &quot;rollout of campy shows ... that felt less like purposeful programming and more like cheap attempts at copying a successful advertising model.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Mimi Avins felt that the show lacked the spark and the writing quality of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, identifying Eve as its weakest link. She felt that Eve did not show &quot;the acting ability or high-voltage charisma that vaulted Will Smith from rapper to television star&quot; in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. During her review of the pilot episode, Melanie McFarland wrote that the sitcom lacked any potential due to Eve&#x27;s poor performance on top of the &quot;[t]errible scenery, cheap costumes, and a few glaring miscasts.&quot; Eve&#x27;s decision to distance the series from her identity as a rapper was questioned by Roger Catlin of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;, who felt that the character of Shelly could have used &quot;the personality charge&quot; from Eve&#x27;s life. Despite finding Eve a charismatic presence, Catlin felt that her acting, along with that of Ali Landry, was poorly developed. Echoing Catlin&#x27;s assessment, the &quot;San Francisco Gate&quot;″s Tim Goodman was critical of Eve&#x27;s and Landry&#x27;s performances. Goodman also wrote that the show was an example of &quot;the worst writing on television,&quot; citing its homophobic jokes and its reliance on clichés.

=== Accolades ===
In spite of mixed reception from television critics, the show, and Eve&#x27;s performance, received several award nominations. In 2004, the show was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Breakout TV Show. Eve was also nominated for Choice TV Actress: Comedy in the same year. Eve was nominated again for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress: Comedy in 2005. She also received two nominations for the Blimp Award for Favorite Television Actress during the 2005 and 2006 Kid&#x27;s Choice Awards. Eve earned a nomination for the 2005 Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series, and the 2005 BET Awards Comedy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

The &quot;season premiere&quot; is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the &quot;season finale&quot; is the date that the final episode of the season aired.
According to The A.C. Nielsen Company, the show achieved high ratings among &quot;Latina adolescents Ages 12–17,&quot; and earned 3.8 million viewers in that demographic in 2005. It was the second-highest UPN sitcom in the category, with only &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; ranking above it in this demographic.
