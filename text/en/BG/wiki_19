<text>A police officer (also called a policeman (male) or policewoman (female), a cop, an [[officer]], or less commonly a [[constable]]) is a warranted law employee of a police force. In most countries, &quot;police officer&quot; is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank &quot;officer&quot; is legally reserved for military personnel.

Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of suspects and the prevention, detection, and reporting of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as members of the public. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example, an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also violate traffic code to perform their duties.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;police&quot; comes from the Greek , meaning government, which came to mean its civil administration. The more general term for the function is law enforcement officer or peace officer. A sheriff is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a shire. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy.

Police officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In &quot;The Federalist&quot; collection of articles and essays, James Madison wrote: &quot;If men were angels, no Government would be necessary&quot;. These words apply to those who serve government, including police. A common nickname for a police officer is &quot;cop&quot;; derived from the verb sense &quot;to arrest&quot;, itself derived from &quot;to grab&quot;. Thus, &quot;someone who captures&quot;, a &quot;copper&quot;, was shortened to just &quot;cop&quot;. It may also find its origin in the Latin , brought to English via the Old French .

==Duties and functions==

The responsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer may wear. In some countries, rules and procedures dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even when off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.

In the majority of Western legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to discourage crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to calls for service, along with routine community policing.

Police are often used as an emergency service and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, disasters, search and rescue operations, and traffic collisions. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with fire and emergency medical services. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of fire police). In many countries, there is a common emergency telephone number that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have introduced command procedures for use in major emergencies or disorder. In the UK, The Gold Silver Bronze command structure is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room. Typically, a Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an &#x27;Incident Control Room&#x27; erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander would be in overall command in the Control Room.
Police are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing citations which typically may result in the imposition of fines, particularly for violations of traffic law. Traffic enforcement is often, but not always, accomplished by police officers on police motorcycles—called &quot;motor officers,&quot; these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply &quot;motors.&quot; Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose cars have broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic first aid such as CPR.

Some park rangers are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within national parks and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas military police perform law enforcement functions within the military.

==Entry and promotion qualifications==

In most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education. Increasing numbers of people joining the police possess tertiary education qualifications and in response to this, many police forces have developed a &quot;fast-track&quot; scheme whereby those with university degrees spend two to three years as a constable before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as sergeants or inspectors. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.) Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States, state laws may codify statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training, but in other countries requirements are set by local police agencies. Generally, each police agency has different requirements. 
Promotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in salary, it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma in shunning promotion, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.

Dependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as detective, police dog handler, mounted police officer, motorcycle officer, water police officer, or firearms officer (in countries where police are not routinely armed).

In some countries, including Singapore, police ranks are supplemented through conscription, similar to national service in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.

==Pay==
In some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served. In the United States, an average patrol officer&#x27;s salary was $64,610 in 2021. In London, capital of the UK, a police officer&#x27;s average basic salary in 2020 was £36,773 per annum. In the Netherlands, the average police officer working on the street is ranked in salary scale 6 to 9, €27,584 to €54,177 gross (€23,805 to €38,037 net) per year. Apart from these scales, there are higher functions which can increase an officer&#x27;s salary.

In some towns of Fairfield County, Connecticut, Police officers have earned $178,000-$312,000 with overtime. Similar pay rates have made reports for New Jersey and Oakland, California police officers. In 2023, a Senior Deputy with The San Francisco Sheriff&#x27;s Office earned a top salary of double those in Connecticut.

== Occupational safety and health ==

There are numerous concerns affecting the safety and health of police officers, including occupational stress and death in the line of duty. On August 6, 2019, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced the creation of the first U.S. state-wide program to support the mental health of police officers. The goal of the program is to train officers in emotional resiliency and to help destigmatize mental health problems.

== Application of force ==
===Individual cases===

Almost universally, police officers are authorized to use force, up to and including deadly force, when acting in a law enforcement capacity. Although most law enforcement agencies follow some variant of the use of force continuum, where officers are only authorized to use the level of force required to match situational requirements, specific thresholds and responses vary between jurisdictions. While officers are trained to avoid excessive use of force, and may be held legally accountable for infractions, the variability of law enforcement and its dependence on human judgment have made the subject an area of controversy and research.

===Accountability===

In the performance of their duties, police officers may act unlawfully, either deliberately or as a result of errors in judgment. Police accountability efforts strive to protect citizens and their rights by ensuring legal and effective law enforcement conduct, while affording individual officers the required autonomy, protection, and discretion. As an example, the use of body-worn cameras has been shown to reduce both instances of misconduct and complaints against officers.

<text>AMORC (standing for, among others, the Ancient Mystical Order of the Rosy Cross or the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis) is a Rosicrucian organization founded by Harvey Spencer Lewis in the United States in 1915. It has lodges, chapters and other affiliated bodies in several countries. It operates as a fraternal order in the mystical Western Esoteric Tradition.

== History ==
Harvey Spencer Lewis in 1904 founded the Rosicrucian Research Society. Lewis was an advertising agent from New York and the founder of another group called the New York Institution for Psychical Research. He founded the organization after a trip to France, claiming that he had been initiated into Rosicrucianism there in what he called an &quot;old tower&quot; in Toulouse. He presented this as a revival of the original, partially mythical and ancient Rosicrucian Order. 

The Ancient Mystical Order of the Rosy Cross (AMORC) was founded in 1915. Lewis was the &quot;imperator&quot; of the group. The group later moved to San Francisco, Tampa, and San Jose; it would establish its world headquarters in the latter. Its headquarters there include a museum, a planetarium, and a temple. The group was successful in the USA, leading to the founding of several branches in Europe, which were mostly independent from the main branch of AMORC. Several of these groups would later schism into their own organizations, but Lewis kept the significant French branch of AMORC tied to the parent by collaborating with Jeanne Guesdon.

Lewis died in 1939. Following his death, Lewis was succeeded by his son, Ralph Maxwell Lewis. Ralph Lewis would die in 1987, succeeded by Gary L. Stewart; Stewart was young, at 34, but was able to be elected with the support of the leader of the powerful French branch, Raymond Bernard. However, Stewart later fought with the AMORC Board of Directors, and was ousted from the organization in 1990; he would later found a splinter group, the Confraternity of the Rose Cross. Bernard also distanced himself from AMORC and himself founded many other groups. Stewart was replaced as imperator by Bernard&#x27;s son Christian Bernard. He was replaced as imperator by Claudio Mazzucco in 2019.

As of 1995, the group reported that it had 1,200 lodges in 86 countries, with 250,000 members being reported in 1990.

== Teachings ==

Many aspects of its teachings and symbolism are taken from other occult groups that H. Lewis had frequented. Chief among these is the Ordo Templi Orientis, led by Aleister Crowley. Other symbols of AMORC were taken from other periodicals. While predominantly Rosicrucian, some later AMORC degrees also incorporate neo-Templar elements. 

The symbol of the group is a red rose on a gold cross, with the cross representing the concepts of death and resurrection and the rose representing love as well as secrecy. Together, they represent the usage of reincarnation progressing towards perfection. The emblem of the group, the Rose Cross, was taken from a periodical run by Crowley (&quot;Equinox&quot; III). The group maintains it is not a religion, instead saying it has members (who it calls &quot;students&quot;) from many different religious origins.

<text>CRAM, or Card Random-Access Memory, model 353-1, was a data storage device invented by NCR, which first appeared on their model NCR-315 mainframe computer in 1962. It was also available for NCR&#x27;s third generation NCR Century series as the NCR/653-100.

A CRAM cartridge contained 256 3x14 inch cards with a PET film magnetic recording surface. Each &quot;deck&quot; of cards could contain up to 5.5 MB of alphanumeric characters. The cards were suspended from eight d-section rods, which were selectively rotated to release a specific card, each card having a unique pattern of notches at one end. The selected card was dropped and wrapped around a rotating drum to be read or written. Each cartridge could store 5.5 MB. 

Later versions of the CRAM, the 353-2 and 353-3, used decks of 512 cards, thus doubling the storage capacity of each unit. 

Each card contains seven tracks containing 1550 slabs (12 bits each). Normally the track was initialized with a four slab header containing the cartridge number (two slabs), the card number and the track number.
Cards were dropped by changing the card rods to a binary configuration and release the two outside &quot;release&quot; rods. Air was blown over the top of the cards to keep them separated, and to increase the dropping speed. Once on the rotating &quot;drum&quot; a series of positive and negative air pressure chambers pulled the card across a magnetic read-write head. After one or more passes over the head, where data is written to or read from the card, a release gate allow the card to be &quot;thrown&quot; along a raceway over the card deck, and onto a &quot;loader&quot; mechanism. The loader used a group of electro-magnetic solenoids to slam the card back onto the control rods. The unit was a monster with two large electric motors that drove four large vacuum/blowers. It was possible to have up to five cards in motion at any point in time; one dropping, one on the drum, two in the return transport, and one being loaded back onto the deck.

If the card didn&#x27;t succeed in dropping there was a &quot;magic wand&quot; similar to a pencil available to solve the problem.

One feature of this device was the potential for a &quot;double drop&quot;, where two cards would drop at once, due to a break in a notch on one card, or, more commonly, a card being held by one rod being dislodged by the adjacent card dropping, usually cards 000 (the deck directory card) and 001 which resulted in the necessity of recreating the directory. This would result in a high pitched noise with which operators were very familiar and could hear even outside the computer room, and damage to the cards. These were called &quot;screamers&quot;, while the opposite problem, cards that wouldn&#x27;t drop, were called &quot;hangers&quot;.

Another interesting feature was that, should an operator accidentally drop all the cards from a cartridge, they could be replaced without worrying about order. The order of the cards was not important because of the notch encoding system.

The first CRAM units were deployed on NCR&#x27;s 315 system. A second generation was deployed on the successor 615 or Century line of computers. Ed Scott wrote the CRAM software for the Century line of computers. CRAM was very successful in the 1960s, offering a fast and secure storage alternative to magnetic tape, but was superseded by the development of superior disk drive technology.

<text>Robert Recorde () was a Welsh physician and mathematician. He invented the equals sign (=) and also introduced the pre-existing plus (+) and minus (−) signs to English speakers in 1557.

==Biography==
Born around 1510, Robert Recorde was the second and last son of Thomas and Rose Recorde of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, in Wales.

Recorde entered the University of Oxford about 1525, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College there in 1531. Having adopted medicine as a profession, he went to the University of Cambridge to take the degree of M.D. in 1545. He afterwards returned to Oxford, where he publicly taught mathematics, as he had done prior to going to Cambridge. He invented the &quot;equals&quot; sign, which consists of two horizontal parallel lines, stating that no two things can be more equal. It appears that he afterwards went to London, and acted as physician to King Edward VI and to Queen Mary, to whom some of his books are dedicated. He was also controller of the Royal Mint and served as Comptroller of Mines and Monies in Ireland. After being sued for defamation by a political enemy, he was arrested for debt and died in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison, Southwark, by the middle of June 1558.

==Publications==

Recorde published several works upon mathematical and medical subjects, chiefly in the form of dialogue between master and scholar, such as the following:
*&quot;The Grounde of Artes, teachings the Worke and Practise, of Arithmeticke, both in whole numbers and fractions&quot; (1543), the first English language book on algebra.
*&quot;The Pathway to Knowledge, containing the First Principles of Geometry ... bothe for the use of Instrumentes Geometricall and Astronomicall, and also for Projection of Plattes&quot; (London, 1551)
*&quot;The Castle of Knowledge, containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celestiall and Materiall, etc.&quot; (London, 1556) A book explaining Ptolemaic astronomy while mentioning the Copernican heliocentric model in passing.
*&quot;The Whetstone of Witte, whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmeteke: containing thextraction of rootes; the cossike practise, with the rule of equation; and the workes of Surde Nombers&quot; (London, 1557). This was the book in which the equals sign was introduced within a printed edition. With the publication of this book Recorde is credited with introducing algebra into the Island of Britain with a systematic notation.
* A medical work, &quot;The Urinal of Physick&quot; (1548), frequently reprinted.
Most of those works were written in the form of a catechism.
Several books whose authors are unknown have been attributed to him: &quot;Cosmographiae isagoge&quot;, &quot;De Arte faciendi Horologium&quot; and &quot;De Usu Globorum et de Statu temporum&quot;.

<doc id="310249" wikidata="Q2978700" url="?curid=310249" title="Straight-three engine">
<text>A straight-three engine (also called an inline-triple or inline-three) is a three-cylinder piston engine where cylinders are arranged in a line along a common crankshaft.

Less common than straight-four engine, straight-three engines have nonetheless been used in various motorcycles, cars and agricultural machinery.

== Design ==

A crankshaft angle of 120 degrees is typically used by straight-three engines, since this results in an evenly spaced firing interval. Another benefit of this configuration is perfect primary balance and secondary balance, however an end-to-end rocking couple is induced because there is no symmetry in the piston velocities about the middle piston. A balance shaft is sometimes used to reduce the vibrations caused by the rocking couple.

Other crankshaft angles have been used occasionally. The 1976–1981 Laverda Jota motorcycle used a 180 degree crankshaft, where the outer pistons rise and fall together and inner cylinder is offset from them by 180 degrees. This results in three power strokes evenly-spaced at 180 degrees each, and then no power strokes during the final 180 degrees of crankshaft rotation. The 2020 Triumph Tiger 900 motorcycle uses a &quot;T-Plane&quot; crankshaft where the crankshaft throws are at 90 intervals, such that the throws for cylinders 1 and 3 are separated by 180 degrees (therefore the three throws together forming a &quot;T&quot; shape when viewed from the end).

== Usage in cars ==

Among the first cars to use a straight-three engine is the 1953–1955 DKW F91, powered by a two-stroke engine, although this was predated by the 3 cylinder 15hp Rolls Royce produced in 1905 and a number of other cars of this era also used 3 cylinder engines. The 1956–1960 Saab 93 saw the introduction of Saab&#x27;s two-stroke engine, which was also used in the Saab 95, Saab 96 and Saab Sonett until 1968 after which it was replaced by the Ford Taunus V4 engine.

The Wartburg cars (manufactured in East Germany) and FSO Syrena (manufactured in Poland) also used straight-three engines.

The 1967 Suzuki Fronte 360 uses a two-stroke engine. In 1980, Suzuki began production of a four-stroke engine, which was introduced in the Alto and Fronte models.

The Subaru EF engine is a 4-stroke petrol engine which was introduced in 1984 and used in the Justy and the Sumo (the export version of the Sambar).

The straight-three versions of the Ford EcoBoost engine – a turbocharged 1.0-litre petrol engine – was introduced in the 2012 Ford Focus. It uses an unbalanced flywheel to shift the inherent three-cylinder imbalance to the horizontal plane where it is more easily managed by engine mounts, and so remove the need to use balance shafts. In 2016, cylinder deactivation was added, claimed to be a world first for three-cylinder engines.

== Usage in motorcycles ==

The advantages of a straight-three engine for motorcycles are that it has a shorter length than an inline-four engine and produces less vibration than a straight-twin engine.

===Four-stroke===
Four-stroke straight-three engines have been used in road bikes and racing bikes by several companies. 

From 1985–1995, the BMW K75 was produced with a straight-three engine (based on the straight-four engine from the BMW K100).

British company Triumph is particularly renowned for a transversely-mounted straight-three engine. Variants have been used in their Speed Triple, Trident, Sprint, and Tiger series.
In addition Triumph makes the Rocket III model, various variants of which have held the record for motorcycle with the largest engine displacement. 

In 2019, the Moto2 class in the MotoGP World Championship switched to using Triumph 765 cc (46.7 cu in) triple engines.

===Two-stroke===
Two-stroke designs are less common in straight-three engines than four-stroke designs, however several were produced by Japanese manufacturers in the late 1960s through to 1980s. 

The Kawasaki triple engine was produced from 1968 to 1980 and was used in various road bikes and racing bikes. Most versions were air-cooled, however several were water-cooled. Similarly, the 1972–1980 Suzuki GT series engines were used for both road bike and racing bikes, and were available in both air-cooled and water-cooled versions.
== Other uses ==
=== Agriculture ===
An example of an agricultural application is the &quot;Fairbanks-Morse 32E14&quot; low-speed diesel engine.

The straight-three layout is common for diesel tractor engines, such as the &quot;Perkins AD3.152&quot;. This engine was used in the Massey Ferguson 35 and Fordson Dextra tractors, as well as for marine and stationary applications.

=== Aviation ===
The Hewland AE75 is a 750 cc two-stroke aircraft engine that was produced in the mid-1980s. It was an inverted three-cylinder design with liquid-cooling that produced .

<text>Wilhelm Xylander (born Wilhelm Holtzman, graecized to Xylander; 26 December 153210 February 1576) was a German classical scholar and humanist. He served as rector of Heidelberg University in 1564.

==Biography==
Born at Augsburg, he studied at Tübingen, and in 1558, when very short of money (caused, according to some, by his intemperate habits), he was appointed to succeed Jakob Micyllus in the professorship of Greek at the University of Heidelberg; he exchanged it for a chair of logic (&quot;publicus organi Aristotelici interpres&quot;) in 1562.

In Heidelberg church and university politics, Xylander was a close partisan of Thomas Erastus.

Xylander was the author of a number of important works, including Latin translations of Dio Cassius (1558), Plutarch (1560–1570) and Strabo (1571). He also edited (1568) the geographical lexicon of Stephanus of Byzantium; the travels of Pausanias (completed after his death by Friedrich Sylburg, 1583); the &quot;Meditations&quot; of Marcus Aurelius (1558), the &quot;editio princeps&quot; based on a Heidelberg manuscript now lost; a second edition in 1568 with the addition of Antoninus Liberalis, Phlegon of Tralles, an unknown Apollonius, and Antigonus of Carystus—all paradoxographers; and the chronicle of George Cedrenus (1566). He translated the first six books of Euclid into German with notes, the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; of Diophantus, and the &quot;De quattuor mathematicis scientiis&quot; of Michael Psellus into Latin.

He died on 10 February 1576 in Heidelberg.

<text>Antoninus Liberalis () was an Ancient Greek grammarian who probably flourished between the second and third centuries AD. He is known as the author of &quot;The Metamorphoses&quot;, a collection of tales that offers new variants of already familiar myths as well as stories that are not attested in other ancient sources.

== Work ==
Antoninus&#x27; only surviving work is the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (, &quot;Metamorphṓseōn Synagogḗ&quot;, ), a collection of forty-one very briefly summarised tales about mythical metamorphoses effected by offended deities, unique in that they are couched in prose, not verse. The literary genre of myths of transformations of men and women, heroes and nymphs, into stars (see &quot;Catasterismi&quot;), plants and animals, or springs, rocks and mountains, were widespread and popular in the classical world. This work has more polished parallels in the better-known &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Ovid and in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Lucius Apuleius. Like them, its sources, where they can be traced, are Hellenistic works, such as Nicander&#x27;s &quot;Heteroeumena&quot; and &quot;Ornithogonia&quot; ascribed to Boios.

The work survives in a single manuscript, of the later 9th century, now in the Palatine Library in Heidelberg; it contains several works. John of Ragusa brought it to the Dominican convent at Basel about 1437; in 1553, Hieronymus Froeben gave it to Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, who gave it to the Library. In 1623, with the rest of the Palatine Library, it was taken to Rome; in 1798, to Paris, as part of Napoleonic plunder under the terms of the Treaty of Tolentino; in 1816, it was restored to Heidelberg.

Guilielmus Xylander printed the text in 1568; since some leaves have since disappeared, his edition is also a necessary authority for the text.

Many of the transformations in this compilation are found nowhere else, and some may simply be inventions of Antoninus. The manner of the narrative is a laconic and conversational prose: &quot;this completely inartistic text,&quot; as Sarah Myers called it, offers the briefest summaries of lost metamorphoses by more ambitious writers, such as Nicander and Boeus. Francis Celoria, the translator, regards the text as perfectly acceptable &quot;koine&quot; Greek, though with numerous &quot;hapax legomena&quot;; it is &quot;grimly simple&quot; and mostly devoid of grammatical particles which would convey humor or a narratorial persona.

<text>Phlegon of [[Tralles]] ( &quot;Phlegon o Trallianos&quot;) was a Greek writer and freedman of the emperor Hadrian, who lived in the 2nd century AD.

==Works==
His chief work was the &quot;Olympiads&quot;, an historical compendium in sixteen books, from the 1st down to the 229th Olympiad (776 BC to AD 137), of which several chapters are preserved in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Chronicle&quot;, Photius, and George Syncellus.

Two short works by him are extant. &quot;On Marvels&quot; consists of &quot;anecdotes culled from sources as diverse as the Greek poet Hesiod and the Roman natural historian Pliny the Elder. Each... recounts a fantastical or paranormal event.&quot; &quot;On Long-Lived Persons&quot; contains a list of Italians who had passed the age of 100, taken from the censuses of the Roman Empire.
Other works ascribed to Phlegon in the &quot;Suda&quot; are a description of Sicily, a work on the Roman festivals in three books, and a topography of Rome:

:&quot;Phlegon of Tralles, freedman of Augustus Caesar, but some say of Hadrian: historian. He wrote Olympiads in 16 books. Up to the 229th Olympiad they contain what was done everywhere. And these in 8 books: &quot;Description of Sicily&quot;; &quot;On long-lived and marvelous persons&quot;, &quot;On the feasts of the Romans&quot; 3 books, &quot;On the places in Rome and by what names they are called&quot;, &quot;Epitome of Olympic victors&quot; in 2 books, and other things.

:&quot;Of this Phlegon, as Philostorgius says, to relate fully in detail what befell with the Jews, while Phlegon and Dio mentioned [these events] briefly and made them an appendix to their own narrative. Since this man does not exhibit at all prudently those who would lead to piety and other virtues, as those others do not either. Josephus, on the contrary, is like one who fears and takes care not to offend the [sc.pagan] Greeks.&quot;

==Reference to Jesus==
Origen of Alexandria (182-254 AD), in &quot;Against Celsus&quot; (Book II, Chap. XIV), wrote that Phlegon, in his &quot;Chronicles&quot;, mentions Jesus: &quot;Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events (although falling into confusion about some things which refer to Peter, as if they referred to Jesus), but also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions.&quot; He referred to a description by Phlegon of an eclipse accompanied by earthquakes during the reign of Tiberius: that there was &quot;the greatest eclipse of the sun&quot; and that &quot;it became night in the sixth hour of the day [i. e., noon] so that stars even appeared in the heavens. There was a great earthquake in Bithynia, and many things were overturned in Nicaea.&quot;

Julius Africanus writes &quot;Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Cæsar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth hour to the ninth...&quot;

Eusebius, in book 2 of Chronicle (Chronicon, quoted by Jerome), refers to Phlegon&#x27;s 13th book for confirmation of an eclipse and earthquakes in Bythinia and Nicaea.

&quot;In the 4th year of the 202nd Olympiad, there was a great eclipse of the Sun, greater than had ever been known before, for at the sixth hour the day was changed into night, and the stars were seen in the heavens. An earthquake occurred in Bythinia and overthrew a great part of the city of Nicæa.&quot;

<text>Trat province (, ), also spelt Trad province, is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), and is located in the region of eastern Thailand. It borders Chanthaburi province to the northwest, and Cambodia and its provinces of Pailin, Battamabang, Pursat, and Koh Kong to its north, northeast and east. To the south, it borders the Gulf of Thailand and Pacific Ocean. In Thailand, it is the 15th smallest province at and 4th least populated province at 229,958 in 2019. Its capital is Trat town.

During the Ayutthaya kingdom, Trat became an important location for trade. During the 1893 Paknam crisis, French soldiers occupied the province, with Siam handing over Trat to French colonial rule in return for Chanthaburi province. However, Trat was returned to Siam in 1907 in return for Siamese land along the Mekong river.

Trat is from Bangkok. The province also serves as a major center for fruit growing, gem mining and fishing in the region.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Trat&quot; is believed to be a corruption of &quot;Krat&quot;(กราด) the Thai name for the tree &quot;Dipterocarpus intricatus,&quot; common to the region and used to make brooms. It is also spelt Trad.

==History==
In 1408, Chinese writer and voyager Ma Huan made one of the earliest references to the gems found in modern-day Chanthaburi and Trat provinces.

The history of Trat can be traced back to the early 17th century during the reign of King Prasat Thong of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Formerly known as &quot;Mueang Thung Yai&quot;, Trat has played an important role in the development of the country&#x27;s stability and economy due to its strategic location. The town of Trat later become a community of Chinese merchants.

After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767, Trat served as a checkpoint and buffer city and was responsible for providing provisions to King Taksin the Great before he moved his forces from Chanthaburi to Ayutthaya. King Taksin then succeeded in driving out the Burmese invaders and liberated the kingdom from foreign rule.

Beginning in the 1850s a gem rush began in modern-day Chanthaburi, Trat and Pailin provinces, resulting in an influx of immigrants from Burma who became the Kula people.

During the 1893 Franco-Siamese crisis, French troops landed and occupied Chanthaburi province. In order to regain Chanthaburi, the Siamese government negotiated with France in the 1904 Franco-Siamese Treaty where it was agreed France would hand back Chanthaburi to Siam in exchange for Siam handing over control of Trat and Koh Kong to the French. The treaty was signed on 13 February 1904, although Trat and Koh Kong had been officially handed over to the French on 22 January. During French colonial control, the appointed governor&#x27;s official residence was Resident Kampot located in Trat City.

On 23 March 1907, it was agreed between Siam and France that France would return control of Trat, except Koh Kong, to the Siamese in exchange for the provinces of Phra Tabong (Battambang), Siem Reap, and Serei Sophoan which all had a Khmer majority population as part of the 1907 Franco-Siamese Treaty. On 6 July 1907, Trat was officially handed back to Siam.

During the French-Thai War of 1940–1941, the Vichy French navy sailed from Saigon to seize Trat. The unprepared Thai warships were caught by surprise. By the end of the 17 January 1941 Battle of Ko Chang, three Thai ships had been left sinking: the HTMS &quot;Chonburi&quot;, HTMS &quot;Songkhla&quot;, and HTMS &quot;Thonburi&quot;. French casualties were light with no ships lost. The Japanese government negotiated a truce, which ended the conflict without further fighting.

When the Vietnamese pushed the Khmer Rouge out of Cambodia in 1985, Pol Pot fled to Thailand and made his headquarters in a plantation villa near Trat. It was built for him by the Thai Army and nicknamed &quot;Office 87&quot;.

As part of Vietnamese border raids in Thailand to eliminate Cambodian groups along the Thai-Cambodian border opposed to the Vietnamese-backed Cambodian governments, namely the Khmer Rouge, Vietnamese soldiers made several incursions into Trat province. In the Battle of Ban Chamrak, around 800 Vietnamese soldiers captured a portion of northern Chamrak sub-district on 1 April 1985. On 9 May, the area was recaptured by Thai marines, army rangers and border patrol police. The Thai side suffered one dead and eight injured, while eight Vietnamese were found dead.

==Geography==
The province covers a land area of .
The total forest area is or 31.4 percent of provincial area.

The Cardamom mountain range forms the boundary to Cambodia in the east of the province, where Trat has borders with three Cambodian provinces: Battambang, Pursat, and Koh Kong.

The third biggest island of Thailand is the province&#x27;s Ko Chang (after Phuket and Ko Samui). The island and more than 40 surrounding smaller islands form the Mu Ko Chang Marine National Park.

Other islands of the province include Ko Kham, Ko Mak, and Ko Phi.

===National parks===
There are two national parks, along with five other national parks, make up region 2 (Si Racha) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Mu Ko Chang National Park, 
* Namtok Khlong Kaeo National Park, 

==Climate==
Most of Thailand receives from to of precipitation per year. Two provinces, Trat and Ranong, receive more than a year, making them the wettest places in the country.

== Economy ==
The economy of Trat province is mainly cantered around agriculture and manufacturing with a small service sector.

Local businesses often participate in trade with Cambodians.

Within Thailand, Trat has the third largest rubber plantation at an area of in 2017. The first rubber cooperative in the province was established in 1994.

In order to better provide for themselves and their families, some farmers shifted away from monoculture farming towards orchard tourism, a form of agritourism.

=== Gem industry ===
Historically both Trat and Chanthaburi provinces were Thailand&#x27;s principal area for ruby production, alongside being a major source of sapphires. The region had started becoming a major source of the world&#x27;s rubies and sapphires supply in the late 1800s, however it lagged behind the Burmese gem industry. When the Burmese government nationalised their deposits in 1963, and the subsequent decline in the supply of gems coming of Burma, the Chanthaburi-Trat gem industry became one of the world&#x27;s main suppliers. By 1982, an estimated 70% of the world&#x27;s high-quality rubies originated from Thailand, of which 85% to 90% came from the Chanthaburi-Trat region, although Burma still led in quality. In 1980, an estimated 20,000 miners mined 39.4 million carats of rubies and sapphires.

Gem deposits in both provinces are alluvial, having been eroded from weathered basalt flows. During the Himalayan orogeny, the region was uplifted and intruded by granites and granodiorites. In the final portion of the orogeny, the region had basaltic dikes intrude the surface as basaltic lava flows. Since the end of the orogeny, the region became geologically quiet, with the tropical climate resulting in intense weathering and erosion. The region&#x27;s deposits can be divided into two mining areas based on the corundum type produced: one entirely within Chanthaburi province, the other within Trat province. The Trat mining area contains the Bo Rai-Bo Waen mining area, which produced significant amounts of rubies, and occasionally green and colour change sapphires.

By 1996, most mining operations in the province had relocated to Cambodia, with Pailin province being contiguous to Thai deposits. Bo Rai, which had been very active, had declined back to a small town. In the 1990s, the Thai government banned commercial mining in the area due to its effects on the countryside. Due to overmining, ruby deposits in the region became depleted by 2009.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the sea with the Khao Banthat mountain range in the background.

The provincial tree is the tropical almond (&quot;Terminalia catappa&quot;). The species of grouper &quot;Plectropomus leopardus&quot; is the provincial aquatic life.

==Administration==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into seven districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 38 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 261 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Trat Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 14 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Trat has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 13 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 29 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations – SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Transport==
===Air===
Trat is served by Trat Airport, built and operated by Bangkok Airways.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="310284" wikidata="Q721945" url="?curid=310284" title="Dance of Death (album)">
<text>Dance of Death is the thirteenth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released first in Japan on 2 September and then 8 September 2003 in the rest of the world excluding North America (where it was released a day later). The album was an analogue recording.

Their second studio release since the return of vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the album features the band&#x27;s first-ever fully acoustic track, &quot;Journeyman&quot;, as well as &quot;New Frontier&quot;, their only song co-written by drummer Nicko McBrain. As with &quot;Brave New World&quot;, its predecessor in 2000, the record was produced by Kevin Shirley, who has worked with Iron Maiden on all subsequent releases.

==Background==
The band first confirmed that they would be working on a follow-up to 2000&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; with producer Kevin Shirley on 27 November 2002; the album was announced alongside a small set of European tour dates for the following year. On 6 January 2003, Shirley confirmed via his website that the band would begin recording that month, followed by the announcement that the basic tracks had been completed on 5 February and that the release was to be mixed in April. On 31 May, the band announced that the album, recorded at Sarm West Studios, would be entitled &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, after which the release date was issued on 17 June.

The band undertook the Dance of Death World Tour in support of the album, which included many theatrical elements inspired by the record&#x27;s songs. During &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, Bruce Dickinson would wear theatrical masks and a cape while moving around the stage; at the end he would dress as the Grim Reaper for the final chorus. During &quot;Paschendale&quot;, Dickinson would wear a traditional British Infantryman trench coat and helmet (although he revealed in the &quot;Death on the Road&quot; documentary that it was actually Hungarian), as worn during World War I, and the set would be decorated with barbed wire. The tour led to a live album and DVD, entitled &quot;Death on the Road&quot;, released in 2005 and 2006.

The album was released as a DVD-Audio disc in 2004, including 5.1 mixes of each song.

==Songs==

&quot;Dance of Death&quot; is the only Iron Maiden album to date in which drummer Nicko McBrain has a songwriting credit, having co-written &quot;New Frontier&quot;. This also makes it the only Iron Maiden album to date in which every member of the band receives a songwriting credit. The song expresses McBrain&#x27;s views on human cloning. McBrain, a born-again Christian, explained that &quot;I personally believe that God created man and it&#x27;s only God&#x27;s right to create a human being because only He can give you a soul. When man attempts to make man then it&#x27;s a monster in a test tube.&quot; 

&quot;Montségur&quot; was based on the fall of the Cathar stronghold of the same name, which fell in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade in 1244. Dickinson, who wrote the song&#x27;s lyrics, states, &quot;There is so much great stuff and so many great stories throughout history that you can make parallels with the modern day – particularly when history repeats itself as often as it does – that it makes for some very colourful subject matter.&quot;

&quot;Paschendale&quot; is about the Battle of Passchendaele which took place during the First World War. It was written by Adrian Smith, who usually contributes to the band&#x27;s shorter, more commercial-sounding songs, but decided to write what he describes as &quot;a traditional Maiden epic&quot;. It features strong progressive rock elements, including its length and detailed structure. Dickinson comments, &quot;the beauty of &#x27;Paschendale&#x27; isn&#x27;t in the epic-ness of the song – although you have to admit it is a powerful and stirring body of music – but the detail.&quot; In live performances, Dickinson introduces the song with a passage from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot;.

According to guitarist Janick Gers, the album&#x27;s title track was inspired by the final scene of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, at the end of which &quot;these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death&quot;. Gers wrote most of the music and explained the concept to Steve Harris, who wrote the lyrics and most of the melodies.

&quot;Face in the Sand&quot; is based on the media coverage surrounding the Iraq War, taking place as the album was being recorded. Dickinson explains, &quot;I remember thinking about the desert sands as an image and how it moves and shifts with time. Specifically what I was thinking was that whatever empires you tend to build – whether they are British, American, Iraqi or whatever, they&#x27;ll all crumble and fade away into something else. So, to my mind at least, the best thing you can hope for, if you were to leave anything behind, is just an imprint in the sand.&quot; The song is notable for being the first and only Iron Maiden track in which McBrain uses a double bass pedal.

The final track, &quot;Journeyman&quot;, is Iron Maiden&#x27;s first and to date only fully acoustic song. According to Dickinson on the &quot;Death on the Road&quot; live album, it is about &quot;the whole process of writing and being a musician&quot;, although Mick Wall describes it as &quot;a wistful tale of &quot;carpe diem&quot;&quot;. The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, &quot;after all the battering that we&#x27;ve given the listener over the last hour of music it just seemed right to play out with something totally unexpected and left field.&quot; The original version appears on the &quot;No More Lies&quot; EP.

==Artwork==

The computer-generated cover art was provided by David Patchett, who asked for his name to be removed from the album&#x27;s credits after the band decided to use an unfinished version. The album cover was received negatively by both fans and critics, being cited on several &quot;worst of&quot; lists. Dickinson later called the cover &quot;embarrassing&quot;.

The original cover art supposedly featured only Eddie and a few monks behind him but the band manager Rod Smallwood felt it looked empty, so he hired someone from IronMaiden.com to design characters surrounding Eddie using the program Poser. They then gave the roughs back to Patchett and asked him to work on the skin and mask textures. Patchett did so but was unimpressed with the result.

==Reception==
Reviews for the album were generally positive with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; describing it as &quot;stupendous stuff and concrete proof that Maiden are as electrifying and important as they have been in a long time&quot;. Sputnikmusic were also positive about the album, giving special mention to &quot;Paschendale&quot;, described as &quot;quite easily the ultimate Maiden masterpiece&quot;. Although deeming the first three songs &quot;refreshing yet unremarkable&quot;, AllMusic describes &quot;Dance of Death&quot; as &quot;a triumphant return to form for these heavy metal legends.&quot;

Although criticising the album for its length and for not &quot;matching the quality&quot; of its predecessor, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, PopMatters praised the band for being able to &quot;still easily outclass most of the younger nu-metal bands today&quot;.

<doc id="310285" wikidata="Q1760078" url="?curid=310285" title="Mayor of Chicago">
<text>The mayor of Chicago is the chief executive of city government in Chicago, Illinois, the third-largest city in the United States. The mayor is responsible for the administration and management of various city departments, submits proposals and recommendations to the Chicago City Council, is active in the enforcement of the city&#x27;s ordinances, submits the city&#x27;s annual budget and appoints city officers, department commissioners or directors, and members of city boards and commissions.

During sessions of the city council, the mayor serves as the presiding officer. The mayor is not allowed to vote on issues except in certain instances, most notably where the vote taken on a matter before the body results in a tie.

The office of mayor was created when Chicago became a city in 1837.

==History==
The first mayor was William B. Ogden (1837–1838). Forty-six men and two women (Jane Byrne, 1979–1983, and Lori Lightfoot, 2019–2023), have held the office. Two sets of father and son have been elected Mayor of Chicago: Carter Harrison III (1879–1887, 1893) and Carter Harrison IV (1897–1905, 1911–1915), as well as Richard J. Daley (1955–1976) and Richard M. Daley (1989–2011). Carter Harrison IV was the first mayor to have been born in the city.

As an interim mayor, David Duvall Orr (1987) held the office for one week, the shortest time period. Richard M. Daley was elected six times becoming Chicago&#x27;s longest-serving mayor, his 22 years surpassing his father&#x27;s record of 21 years.

The first Irish Catholic mayor was John Patrick Hopkins (1893–1895), and Rahm Emanuel (2011–2019) is the only Jewish American to have served as mayor.

Harold Washington (1983–1987) was the first African American mayor. Lightfoot (2019–2023) was the city&#x27;s first African American woman and first LGBT mayor. Brandon Johnson (2023–present) is the fourth African American mayor, Eugene Sawyer (1987–1989) having been selected by the council after Washington died in office.

==Appointment powers==
The mayor appoints the commissioner of the Chicago Fire Department, the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department and the heads of other departments, the largest of which are the Water Management Department (formed by the consolidation of the former Water Department and Sewer Department under Richard M. Daley), and the Streets &amp; Sanitation Department. The mayor also appoints members to the boards of several special-purpose governmental bodies including City Colleges of Chicago, Chicago Park District, Chicago Public Library, Chicago Housing Authority, Chicago Transit Authority, and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority. Under Richard M. Daley, the Illinois legislature granted the mayor power to appoint the governing board and chief executive officer of the Chicago Public Schools and subordinated the district to the mayor; the district had long been an independent unit of government.

The Chicago City Clerk and City Treasurer of Chicago are elected separately, as are the 50 alderpersons who form the city council. The mayor is empowered, however, to fill vacancies in any of these 52 elected offices by appointment. In turn, the city council elects one of its own to fill a mayoral vacancy.

By charter, Chicago has a &quot;weak-mayor&quot; system, in which most of the power is vested in the city council. In practice, however, the mayor of Chicago has long been one of the most powerful municipal chief executives in the nation. Unlike in most other weak-mayor systems, the mayor has the power to draw up the budget. For most of the 20th century, before the decline of patronage and the mayor&#x27;s office becoming officially nonpartisan in 1999, the mayor was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the city&#x27;s Democratic Party, and had great influence over the ward organizations. Located in City Hall, &quot;the fifth floor&quot; is sometimes used as a metonym for the office and power of the mayor.

==Election and succession==
The mayor of Chicago is elected by popular vote every four years, on the last Tuesday in February. A run-off election, in case no candidate garners more than fifty percent of the vote, is held on the first Tuesday in April. The election is held on a non-partisan basis. Chicago is the largest city in the United States not to limit the term of service for its mayor.

In accordance with Illinois law, the city council elects a vice mayor who serves as interim mayor in the event of a vacancy in the office of the mayor or the inability of the mayor to serve due to illness or injury, until the city council elects one of its members acting mayor or until the mayoral term expires. However, if a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor with more than 28 months remaining in the mayoral term and at least 130 days before the next general municipal election, then a special election must be held to choose a new mayor to serve out the remainder of the term at that general municipal election; if a vacancy occurs with fewer than 28 months remaining in the mayoral term or fewer than 130 days before the next general municipal election, then the acting mayor serves as mayor until the mayoral term expires.

The order-of succession involving the vice mayor was made concrete following disputes that arose in the aftermath of the death in office of Richard J. Daley, and was subsequently implemented following the death in office of Harold Washington, which saw Vice Mayor David Orr become acting mayor. Prior to this, the city had vague succession laws which indicated that the president pro tempore of the City Council would succeed as mayor. This was not followed after the death of Daley, and the city council appointed Michael Bilandic acting mayor instead of having pro tempore Wilson Frost become mayor, due to City Corporation Counsel William R. Quinlan ruling that, since the city did not have a statute specifically outlining succession, the City Council would need to elect the interim mayor.

Six instances have seen the City Council appoint either an acting mayor, acting mayor pro tempore, or interim mayor.

In the absence of the mayor during meetings of the city council, the president pro tempore of the city council, who is a member of and elected by the city council, acts as presiding officer. Unlike the mayor, the president pro tempore can vote on all legislative matters. If neither the mayor nor pro tempore can preside, the vice mayor presides.

==List of mayors==


Between 1833 and 1837, Chicago was incorporated as a town and headed by town presidents. Since 1837, it has been incorporated as a city and headed by mayors.

The mayoral term in Chicago was one year from 1837 through 1863, when it was changed to two years. In 1907, it was changed again, this time to four years. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation moved them to April. In 1869, however, election day was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were changed. In 1875, election day was moved back to April by the city&#x27;s vote to operate under the Cities and Villages Act of 1872.

† Died/murdered in office.&lt;br&gt;
1 Since 1999, mayoral elections have officially been nonpartisan. A 1995 Illinois law stipulated that &quot;candidates for mayor ... no longer would run under party labels in Chicago&quot;. However, Richard M. Daley, Rahm Emanuel, Lori Lightfoot, and Brandon Johnson are known to be Democrats.

==Vice mayor==
In accordance with Illinois law, the city council elects a vice mayor who serves as interim mayor in the event of a vacancy in the office of the mayor or the inability of the mayor to serve due to illness or injury, until the city council elects one of its members acting mayor or until the mayoral term expires. The current vice mayor is Walter Burnett.

The position was created by a state law that was passed in response to the power struggle that took place over succession following Richard J. Daley&#x27;s death in office.

If neither the mayor nor president pro tempore can preside over a City Council meeting, then the vice mayor presides.

The position was long considered to be largely ceremonial. However, in 2023, Mayor Brandon Johnson successfully championed a resolution that gave the office a $400,000 budget. He also had his vice mayor, Burnett, act as an official community liaison for the mayoral administration.

<doc id="310287" wikidata="Q1859573" url="?curid=310287" title="Manchester Victoria station">
<text>Manchester Victoria station in Manchester, England, is a combined mainline railway station and Metrolink tram stop. Situated to the north of the city centre on Hunts Bank, close to Manchester Cathedral, it adjoins Manchester Arena which was constructed on part of the former station site in the 1990s. Opened in 1844 and part of the Manchester station group, Manchester Victoria is Manchester&#x27;s second busiest railway station after Piccadilly, and is the busiest station managed by Northern.

The station hosts local and regional services to destinations in Northern England, such as , , Bradford, , , , Halifax, Wigan, , Blackpool (Sundays only) and Liverpool using the original Liverpool to Manchester line. Most trains calling at Victoria are operated by Northern. TransPennine Express services call at the station from Liverpool to Newcastle/Scarborough and services towards Manchester Airport (via the Ordsall Chord) from Middlesbrough/Redcar/Newcastle.

Manchester Victoria is a major interchange for the Metrolink light rail system. Two former railway lines into the station have been converted to tram operations: the line to Bury was converted in the early 1990s, in the first phase of Metrolink construction, and the line through Oldham to Rochdale was converted during 2009–2014. In the other direction, trams switch to on-street running when they emerge from Victoria Station and continue southwards through the city centre to Piccadilly or Deansgate-Castlefield.

In 2009, Victoria was voted the worst category B interchange station in the United Kingdom. The station underwent a two-year £44million modernisation programme which was completed in August 2015. Renovation entailed electrification of lines through the station, renewed Metrolink stop with an additional platform, restoration of listed features, upgraded retail units, and a new roof. The Ordsall Chord directly linking Victoria to Oxford Road and Piccadilly was completed in December 2017.

== History ==

===Origins===
The Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&amp;LR) was founded in 1836 and the company began building its line between Manchester and Leeds in 1837. Originally its line terminated at Manchester Oldham Road, which opened on 3 July 1839. The company realised it would be advantageous to join its line to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR), creating a through route from Liverpool to Yorkshire with a joint station serving the centre of Manchester. In 1839, Samuel Brooks, vice-chairman of the M&amp;LR, bought land at Hunt&#x27;s Bank close to the cathedral and presented it to the company for the new station. The site was on the north bank of the River Irk, between the workhouse to the north which had opened in 1793 and Walker&#x27;s Croft Cemetery to the south. After several years of negotiations between the companies, work started in 1842. The M&amp;LR built an extension from Miles Platting to the station which opened on 1 January 1844. On this date, the Oldham Road terminus was closed to passenger services and became a goods station. The new station had a long single platform which handled M&amp;LR trains to Leeds and elsewhere at its eastern end. The L&amp;MR extended its line from Ordsall to Victoria and its trains operated from the western end from 4 May 1844, on which date its Liverpool Road station terminus became a goods station.

The station was named Victoria in 1843. Its long, single-storey building, designed by George Stephenson and completed by John Brogden, was approached by a wooden footbridge over the River Irk before the river was culverted. Most of the original 1844 station buildings are standing including part of the original façade on Hunt&#x27;s Bank.

The L&amp;MR became part of the Grand Junction Railway in 1845, which in turn amalgamated with other railways to create the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1846; the M&amp;LR amalgamated with other railways to create the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) the following year. The headquarters of the L&amp;YR were based alongside Victoria.
===Expansion===
By the mid-1840s six railway companies operated from the station connecting Manchester to London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds and Sheffield. Victoria Station dominated the Long Millgate area and was one of the biggest passenger stations in Britain.

Victoria underwent several phases of expansion as traffic grew. In 1865, four bay platforms were built on the eastern side on land reclaimed from the cemetery, and another was built on the western side, a second through platform was built at the northern side, and the station&#x27;s facilities were expanded by the construction of a new east wing of the station building. Two decades later, the L&amp;YR purchased and demolished the workhouse north of the station, and its site was used to build another bay and five through platforms which came into use in 1884. That same year, the LNWR opened its own station, immediately to the west on the opposite side of the River Irwell, and vacated Victoria.

Victoria reached its maximum extent of 17 platforms in 1904 when the station was enlarged with extra bay platforms to the south. The present station façade, designed by William Dawes, was built in 1909. The cast-iron train sheds behind the façade were long.

Because the station handled large amounts of parcel and newspaper traffic, an overhead parcels carrier system was constructed in 1895. It consisted of an overhead track which ran in a circuit around the station, upon which electrically powered trolleys ran suspended from the track, operated by airborne attendants. A large basket could be raised and lowered from the trolleys to distribute parcels and newspapers across the station. The system operated until 1940.

The L&amp;YR merged with the LNWR on 1 January 1922. A year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). From 16 April 1929, Victoria and Exchange station were linked by the westward extension of platform 11 over the Irwell bridge, known as platform &quot;11 Middle&quot;, which joined to Exchange&#x27;s platform 3 to create Europe&#x27;s longest platform at . Crossovers enabled it to accommodate three trains arriving and departing independently. Exchange Station closed in 1969 and its services were transferred to Victoria. The Exchange Station site opposite the cathedral was for many years used as a car park, until redevelopment of the site began in 2015.

The station suffered bomb damage during the Manchester Blitz in World War II. On 23 December 1940, several bombs hit the station destroying the parcels office, and a large part of the roof over platforms 12 to 16. The parcels office was rebuilt, but the damaged parts of the roof were taken down and not replaced. The station came into the ownership of British Railways in 1948.

===Picc-Vic tunnel and Metrolink===
Proposals to build an underground station, &quot;Victoria Low Level&quot; as part of the Picc-Vic tunnel project emerged in the early-1970s. The scheme proposed creating a direct rail link between Victoria and via a tunnel and creating several underground stations in Manchester city centre. Platforms 1–4 at Victoria were taken out of use in 1973 in anticipation of the tunnel coming to the surface in that part of the station.

The tunnel project was cancelled in the late 1970s because of high costs, and in the 1980s transport planners turned to light rail as a lower-cost option. As a result, the stations were linked by the Manchester Metrolink system which opened in 1992. A street-level tramway was built across the city centre linking the stations and two converted rail lines to Altrincham and Bury. The tram stop at Victoria replaced the former Bury Line platforms and the tram line was extended into the streets through a new entrance in the side of the station.

===Downsizing===

In the 1980s and 90s, British Rail adopted a policy of concentrating Manchester services into . In 1989, the Windsor Link chord in Salford opened, enabling many of Victoria&#x27;s services from the north to be diverted to Piccadilly and in the same year, trans-Pennine services were also transferred. Victoria was reduced to six platforms, and part was sold for development. Between 1992 and 1994, the Manchester Arena was built over the northern part of the station site. Three of the five through tracks between platforms 11 and 12 were removed, along with platforms 12–17. The station was reduced to four through tracks and four through platforms, three of which were built to replace the removed platforms 12–14. They are covered by the Arena which was joined to the station by means of a raft above them. The Arena is accessed via stairs on Hunts Bank and from the station concourse. Following reconstruction, the platforms were renumbered; platforms 1 and 2 are bay platforms facing east (formerly platforms 9 and 10), and the through platforms are 3 to 6 (platform 3 was formerly platform 11). The through platforms are used by mid-distance services.

=== Renovation===

In 2009, Victoria was identified as the worst category B interchange station because of its dilapidated fabric and environment. The Transport Secretary, Lord Adonis, announced that, with nine others, it would receive a share of £50million for a refurbishment programme. Victoria&#x27;s £5million share of the &#x27;Better Stations&#x27; Network Rail funding for improvements was cancelled in the June 2010 budget cuts, but replacement funding was arranged. On 16 February 2010, Network Rail announced its intention to refurbish the station as part of the Northern Hub improvement proposals turning it into an interchange for local and regional services throughout north-west England. In August 2010, Network Rail announced the work would go ahead, despite the withdrawal of the £5million funding. Station improvements included an ETFE roof, restoration of its walls, exterior canopy and period features, new platforms for additional services, improved access to the Manchester Arena and improved retail and dining facilities.

Work to refurbish the station began in April 2013. The old roof was dismantled in autumn 2013. Installation of the £17million roof began in May 2014 and final roof beam was lifted into position on 13 October 2014. Installation of the ETFE sheeting was completed in spring 2015, and the station upgrade was completed in August 2015, with the official reopening that October.

The Ordsall Chord was finished in 2017 and links Victoria to Piccadilly. It is anticipated that, after re-routeing services, passenger numbers would increase to 12million by 2019, compared with 6.6million in 2011/12. The chord allows trains to run directly between Piccadilly and Victoria, shortening journey times on TransPennine Express routes between Manchester Airport and Newcastle, Redcar, Hull and Scarborough. An express service from Liverpool Lime Street to Newcastle via Victoria is operated by TransPennine Express. Reinstatement of the south and west curve at Todmorden on the Caldervale Line facilitated a direct service between Victoria and Burnley Manchester Road Station for the first time in almost fifty years.

===Electrification===
In the 1900s the Bury Line, a busy commuter line which served the suburbs of north Manchester from Victoria, was losing passengers to tramway competition, in response to this, in 1914 the L&amp;YR decided to electrify this line using a unique 1,200 volt side-contact third rail system, in an effort to win back passengers. Electrification of this route was completed in 1916. As the scheme was a success, in the early 1920s the L&amp;YR drew up plans to extend electrification to the Oldham Loop Line using the same system. The scheme progressed to an advanced stage, however with the reorganisations of railway companies in the 1920s, the new management had no interest in pursuing the scheme and it was dropped. This meant that the Bury Line remained as the only electrified line into Victoria, and it remained as such until 1991 when it was closed to be converted into part of the Metrolink system.

No further electrification came to Victoria until the 21st century, when as part of Network Rail&#x27;s Northern Hub scheme, overhead electric wires have been erected to Victoria from Manchester to Liverpool in 2015, and Manchester to Preston and through to Blackpool in 2019.

==Layout==
Manchester Victoria has six railway platforms and the Metrolink stop has four (four platform faces on three tracks). Two railway platforms are bays numbered 1 &amp; 2 for terminating trains arriving from the east and four are through platforms numbered 3–6 at the northern side of the station. The Metrolink platforms are parallel to, and south of, the bay platforms. Only the bay and Metrolink platforms are under the new roof, the through platforms 4, 5 and 6 are mostly covered by Manchester Arena.
==Architecture and features==
The original M&amp;LR single-storey offices facing Hunt&#x27;s Bank Approach were built in the Italianate style in sandstone ashlar with slate roofs in 1844. They were later enlarged and given a second storey. William Dawes built the station&#x27;s larger extension for the L&amp;YR in 1909. It is at right-angles to the north end of the old station giving the enlarged station an L-shaped plan. Facing Victoria Station Approach, its façade is in the Edwardian neo-Baroque style, four storeys high and 31 bays to the rounded corner at the south-east end. The ground floor windows have rounded heads and those on the floors above are square. The ornate glass and iron canopy along the façade displays the names of destinations that the station served in Art Nouveau lettering. The canopy was damaged by the Provisional IRA&#x27;s 1996 bomb placed in a street adjacent to the Arndale Centre and was restored four years later.

Heritage features in the concourse were restored during the 2013-15 renovation, they include the café with its glass dome and mosaic lettering which was originally the first-class dining room, the adjacent bookstall, and the original 1909 wood-panelled booking hall. In the entrance is a large, white glazed tiled map showing the former network of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.

Underneath the map is a bronze World War I war memorial with effigies of Saint George and Saint Michael at each end which was installed in 1923. At the south end of the concourse is the &#x27;soldier&#x27;s gate&#x27; which opened to the former fish docks from where thousands of soldiers departed for World War I and where a bronze plaque was erected to commemorate them. The gateway was restored in 2015 and a steel screen inserted featuring a map of World War I Commonwealth grave cemeteries in Northern France and Belgium.

The station received Grade II listed building status in 1988.
== National Rail services ==

Manchester Victoria is served by two train operating companies, Northern and TransPennine Express. It is occasionally used by CrossCountry services during engineering works. The Chat Moss route to Liverpool is operated by TransPennine Express Class 185s DMUs and Northern Class 769 BMMUs (peak time &amp; early morning only). The Ribble Valley Line to Blackburn and Clitheroe is operated by Class 156 and Class 150. Leeds Calder Valley services are usually operated by Class 158 Sprinter DMUs, though Class 195 Civity units are now used on many Chester trains. New stock was introduced on TPE routes in 2019–20, including Class 68 &quot;Nova 3&quot; push-pull sets and Class 802 &quot;Nova 1&quot; bi-mode multiple units, although the former were withdrawn from December 2023.

Since the May 2018 timetable change, all express services on the North TransPennine route call at the station. These services are run by TransPennine Express. Westbound, two trains an hour run express to Liverpool Lime Street (one calling at Lea Green and the other calling at Newton-le-Willows). The other pair of services run westbound to Manchester Airport via the Ordsall Chord and Manchester Piccadilly. Eastbound, there are 4 trains per hour running via Huddersfield, Leeds and York. After York, one train an hour ran to each of Edinburgh, Newcastle, Redcar Central and Scarborough.

From the winter 2023 timetable change, the service was somewhat reduced (due to ongoing staffing issues at the TOC), with only the hourly Liverpool - Newcastle and Manchester Airport - calling here. However, as of the December 2024 timetable changes, the former service pattern was restored, and 4 trains per hour operate between Manchester Victoria and Leeds via Huddersfield. 

Also since the May 2018 timetable change, services along the Calder Valley line have been significantly sped up. Stations between Rochdale and Manchester are now served by Blackburn services. This means that Calder Valley services now run non-stop between Rochdale and Manchester. As a result, there are now 6 trains an hour to Rochdale.

== Victoria tram stop ==
Manchester Victoria is an interchange with the city&#x27;s Metrolink light rail system. The stop is at the northern edge of the system&#x27;s Zone 1 and the start of the Bury Line.

The tram platforms opened on 6 April 1992 for services to Bury which replaced the long-established heavy rail service. The tram platforms were built on the site of the former railway platforms 5 to 8, the terminus of the Bury line. The line was extended into the city-centre streets via a sharp curve south from the platform ends and out through a new entrance in the wall at the side of the station; The system operates on some British Rail lines that have been converted to light rail operation and on-street tram tracks. In October 2009 the Oldham Loop Line was closed for conversion to a Metrolink line. It was completed in March 2014 after reopening in stages to .

The 1992 Metrolink platforms consisted of an island platform containing platforms B and C, and a side platform for Bury bound trams lettered A, which was later taken out of use due to leaks in the station roof.

The Metrolink platforms at Victoria closed on 21 February 2014 and were rebuilt in a different configuration to allow for increased services. The rebuilt stop reopened on 18 February 2015. The new configuration has two island platforms serving three tracks, with platform faces lettered A, B, C and D; the outer platforms A and D are for through trams, city-bound and northbound respectively, and the centre platforms B and C, which both serve the same track, accommodate terminating Manchester Airport services as of 2024. The stop is one of the most used on the Metrolink network.

=== Metrolink services ===
As of 2024, Metrolink services run through Victoria to Altrincham, Bury, , , Rochdale via Oldham, and Piccadilly. Services run every twelve minutes on each route at most operating times.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 19 August 1918, an electric train collided with the buffers, injuring 29 people.
* On the early morning of 10 December 1947, a train of 20 tank wagons loaded with petrol ran out of control while descending the bank towards Victoria. To avoid a collision with another train, it was diverted into the empty bay at platform 7, where it crashed through the buffers at , mounted the concourse, and came to a rest just short of the booking office. Swift action was taken to prevent an outbreak of fire. The train driver was killed in the collision, the fireman was injured and the guard suffered from shock.
* On 25 April 1994, two vehicles of a freight train derailed while passing through new platform 6, which had opened that day. The derailed vehicles damaged the platform edging stones along most of its length, putting it out of use until it was repaired.
* On 15 June 1996, a large truck bomb was detonated about from the station by the Provisional IRA. The blast shattered many windows along the station&#x27;s façade, and glass fell onto the glass canopy causing it serious damage. The station was closed for several days. The blast also damaged the glass and steel roof over the concourse and platforms, which resulted in the removal of much of the glasswork and cladding.
* On 18 October 2016, a panel of the roof, which had been built the year before, collapsed under the weight of rain water, causing minor injury to two people. The damage was blamed on seagulls weakening the structure by pecking at the roof.
* On 22 May 2017, the station was evacuated and closed and services were cancelled following the bombing at Manchester Arena which is partially above the station. The explosion took place in the public area linking the station to the arena immediately above the station&#x27;s through platforms, causing structural damage to the station which was closed, resulting in significant disruption to train and tram services. The station reopened to traffic on 30 May 2017, following the police investigation and repairs to the fabric of the building. A memorial space created following the bombing exists adjacent to the &#x27;Soldier&#x27;s Gate&#x27; Memorial.
*On 31 December 2018, three people, including a police officer were stabbed at around 20:50 GMT. A man was held on suspicion of attempted murder.

<doc id="310288" wikidata="Q334714" url="?curid=310288" title="Duchy of Athens">
<text>The Duchy of Athens (Greek: Δουκᾶτον Ἀθηνῶν, &quot;Doukaton Athinon&quot;; Catalan: &quot;Ducat d&#x27;Atenes&quot;) was one of the Crusader states set up in Greece after the conquest of the Byzantine Empire during the Fourth Crusade as part of the process known as Frankokratia, encompassing the regions of Attica and Boeotia, and surviving until its conquest by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century.

==History==
===Establishment of the Duchy===

The first duke of Athens (as well as of Thebes, at first) was Otto de la Roche, a minor Burgundian knight of the Fourth Crusade. Although he was known as the &quot;Duke of Athens&quot; from the foundation of the duchy in 1205, the title did not become official until 1260. Instead, Otto proclaimed himself &quot;Lord of Athens&quot; (in Latin &quot;Dominus Athenarum&quot;, in French &quot;Sire d&#x27;Athenes&quot;). The local Greeks called the dukes &quot;Megas Kyris&quot; (, &quot;Great Lord&quot;), from which the shortened form &quot;Megaskyr&quot;, often used even by the Franks to refer to the Duke of Athens, is derived.

Athens was originally a vassal state of the Kingdom of Thessalonica, but after Thessalonica was captured in 1224 by Theodore, the Despot of Epirus, the Principality of Achaea claimed suzerainty over Athens, a claim disputed by the de la Roche in the War of the Euboeote Succession. Like the rest of Latin Greece, however, the Duchy recognized the suzerainty of Charles I of Sicily after the Treaties of Viterbo in 1267.

The Duchy occupied the Attic peninsula as well as Boeotia and extended partially into Thessaly, sharing an undefined border with Thessalonica and then Epirus. It did not hold the islands of the Aegean Sea, which were Venetian territories, but exercised influence over the Latin Triarchy of Negroponte. The buildings of the Acropolis in Athens served as the palace for the dukes.

===Aragonese conquest===
The Duchy was held by the family of la Roche until 1308, when it passed to Walter V of Brienne. Walter hired the Catalan Company, a group of mercenaries founded by Roger de Flor, to fight against the Byzantine successor state of Epirus, but when he tried to dismiss and cheat them of their pay in 1311, they slew him and the bulk of the Frankish nobility at the Battle of Halmyros and took over the Duchy. Walter&#x27;s son Walter VI of Brienne retained only the lordship of Argos and Nauplia, where his claims to the Duchy were still recognized.

In 1312, the Catalans recognized the suzerainty of King Frederick III of Sicily, who appointed his son Manfred as Duke. The ducal title remained in the hands of the Crown of Aragon until 1388, but actual authority was exercised by a series of vicars-general. In 1318/19 the Catalans conquered Siderokastron and the south of Thessaly as well, and created the Duchy of Neopatras, united to Athens. Part of Thessaly was conquered from the Catalans by the Serbian Empire in the 1340s.

Under Aragonese rule, the feudal system continued to exist, not anymore under the &quot;Assizes of Romania&quot;, but under the &quot;Customs of Barcelona&quot;, and the official common language was now Catalan instead of French. Each city and district—on the example of Sicily—had its own local governor (&quot;veguer&quot;, &quot;castlà&quot;, &quot;capità&quot;), whose term of office was fixed at three years and who was nominated by the Duke, the vicar-general or the local representatives. The principal towns and villages were represented by the &quot;síndic&quot;, which had their own councils and officers. Judges and notaries were elected for life or even inherited offices.

===Decline and fall===

In 1379 the Navarrese Company, in the service of the Latin emperor James of Baux, conquered Thebes and part of the Duchy of Neopatras. Meanwhile, the Aragonese kept another part of Neopatras and Attica.

After 1381 the Duchy was ruled by the Kings of Sicily until 1388 when the Acciaioli family of Florence captured Athens. Neopatras was occupied in 1390.

From 1395 to 1402 the Venetians briefly controlled the Duchy. In 1444 Athens became a tributary of Constantine Palaeologus, the Despot of Morea and heir to the Byzantine throne. In 1456, after the Fall of Constantinople (1453) to the Ottoman Empire, Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey conquered the remnants of the Duchy. Despite the Ottoman conquest, the title of &quot;Duke of Athens and Neopatras&quot; continued in use by the Kings of Sicily, and through them by the Kings of Spain, up to the present day.

==The Latin Church in the Duchy of Athens==

Athens was the seat of a metropolitan archdiocese within the Patriarchate of Constantinople when it was conquered by the Franks. The seat, however, was not of importance, being the twenty-eighth in precedence in the Byzantine Empire. Nonetheless, it had produced the prominent clergyman Michael Choniates. It was a metropolitan see (province or eparchy) with eleven suffragans at the time of conquest: Euripus, Daulia, Coronea, Andros, Oreos, Scyrus, Karystos, Porthmus, Aulon, Syra and Seriphus, and Ceos and Thermiae (or Cythnus). The structure of the Greek church was not significantly changed by the Latins, and Pope Innocent III confirmed the first Latin Archbishop of Athens, Berard, in all his Greek predecessors&#x27; rights and jurisdictions. The customs of the church of Paris were imported to Athens, but few western European clergymen wished to be removed to such a distant see as Athens. Antonio Ballester, however, an educated Catalan, had a successful career in Greece as archbishop.
The Parthenon, which had been the Orthodox church of the &quot;Theotokos Atheniotissa&quot;, became the Catholic Church of Saint Mary of Athens. The Greek Orthodox church survived as an underground institution without official sanction by the governing Latin authorities. The Greek clergy had not typically been literate in the twelfth century and their education certainly worsened under Latin domination, when their church was illegal.

The archdiocese of Thebes also lay within the Athenian duchy. Unlike Athens, it had no suffragans. However, the Latin archbishopric produced several significant figures as archbishops, such as Simon Atumano. It had a greater political role than Athens because it was situated in the later capital of the duchy at Thebes. Under the Catalans, the Athenian diocese had expanded its jurisdiction to thirteen suffragans, but only the dioceses of Megara, Daulia, Salona, and Boudonitza lay within the duchy itself. The archiepiscopal offices of Athens and Thebes were held by Frenchmen and Italians until the late fourteenth century, when Catalan or Aragonese people began to fill them.

==Dukes of Athens==

===De la Roche family===
Of Burgundian origin, the dukes of the petty lordly family from La Roche renewed the ancient city of Plato and Aristotle as a courtly European capital of chivalry. The state they built around it was, throughout their tenure, the strongest and most peaceful of the Latin creations in Greece.

* Otto (1205–1225)
* Guy I (1225–1263)
* John I (1263–1280)
* William I (1280–1287)
* Guy II (1287–1308)

===Briennist claimants===
The Athenian parliament elected the count of Brienne to succeed Guy, but his tenure was brief and he was killed in battle by the Catalans. His wife briefly had control of the city, too. The heirs of Brienne continued to claim the duchy, but were recognised only in the Lordship of Argos and Nauplia. 
* Walter V of Brienne (1308–1311)
* Joanna of Châtillon (1311–1354)
* Walter VI of Brienne (1311–1356)
* Isabella of Brienne (1356–1360)
* Sohier of Enghien (1356–1367)
* Walter IV of Enghien (1367–1381)
* Louis of Enghien (1381–1394)

===Aragonese domination===
The conquest of the duchy by the Catalan Company and subsequent annexation to Aragon came after a disputed succession following the death of the last Burgundian duke. The Catalans recognised the king of Sicily as suzerain and this left the duchy often as an appanage in the hands of younger sons and under vicars general.

* Roger Deslaur (1311–1312)
* Manfred (1312–1317)
* William II (1317–1338)
* John II (1338–1348)
* Frederick I (1348–1355)
* Frederick II (1355–1377)
* Maria (1377–1379)
* Peter IV (1379–1387)

====Catalan vicars-general====
These were the vicars-general of the Crown of Sicily, and after 1379 of the Crown of Aragon. 
* Berenguer Estañol (1312–1316)
* Alfonso Fadrique (1317 – ca. 1330)
* Odo of Novelles, possibly appointed &quot;pro tempore&quot; to lead the war against Walter VI of Brienne in 1331
* Nicholas Lancia (ca. 1331–1335)
* Raymond Bernardi (1354–1356)
* Gonsalvo Ximénez of Arenós (1359)
* Matthew of Moncada (1359–1361)
* Peter de Pou (1361–1362)
* Roger de Llúria (1362–1369/70), &quot;de facto&quot; and unrecognized until 1366
* Gonsalvo Ximénez of Arenós (1362–1363), uncertain
* Matthew of Moncada (1363–1366), only &quot;de jure&quot;
* Matthew of Peralta (1370–1374)
* Louis Fadrique (1375–1382)
* Philip Dalmau, Viscount of Rocaberti (1379–1386, &quot;de facto&quot; only during his stay in Greece 1381–1382)
** Raymond de Vilanova (1382–1386), deputy of Philip Dalmau after his departure from Greece
* Bernard of Cornellà (1386–1387), never actually went to Greece
* Philip Dalmau, Viscount of Rocaberti (1387–1388)
** Peter of Pau (1386–1388), deputy of Bernard of Cornellà and then of Philip Dalmau in Greece until the fall of Athens to Nerio Acciaioli

===Acciaioli family===
The Florentine Acciaioli (or Acciajuoli) governed the duchy from their removal of the Catalans, with the assistance of the Navarrese. While Nerio willed the city and duchy to Venice, it returned to the Florentines until the Turkish conquest.

* Nerio I (1388–1394)
* Antonio I (1394–1395)
* &quot;Venetian control&quot; (1395–1402), under &quot;podestàs&quot;:
** Albano Contarini (1395–1397)
** Lorenzo Venier (1397–1399)
** Ermoaldo Contarini (1399–1400)
** Nicolo Vitturi (1400–1402)
* Antonio I (1402–1435), restored
* Nerio II (1435–1439)
* Antonio II (1439–1441)
* Nerio II (1441–1451), restored
* Claire (1451–1454)
** with Bartolomeo Contarini (1451–1454)
* Francesco I (1451–1454)
* Francesco II (1455–1458)

==The Duchy, Dante Alighieri, and William Shakespeare==
Italian poet Dante Alighieri (c. 1265-1321), in the &quot;Inferno&quot; segment of his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, meets, along with the Roman poet Virgil, the mythological Minotaur and, speaking with him, he mentions &quot;the Duke of Athens&quot; (Theseus). So does Shakespeare in his comedy &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.
In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (especially in &quot;Inferno&quot;), there are many references to Pelasgian mythology, and the poet connects them to Late Middle Ages Balkans, such as with the Duke of Athens.

<text>Téa Leoni (; born Elizabeth Téa Pantaleoni; February 25, 1966) is an American actress. In her early career, she starred in the television sitcoms &quot;Flying Blind&quot; (1992–93) and &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; (1995–1998). Her breakthrough role was in the 1995 action comedy film &quot;Bad Boys&quot;. Leoni had lead roles in films such as &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998), &quot;The Family Man&quot; (2000), &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; (2001), &quot;Spanglish&quot; (2004), and &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (2005). From 2014 to 2019, she starred as Elizabeth McCord, Secretary of State, in the CBS political drama series &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Leoni was born on February 25, 1966, in New York City. Her mother, Emily Ann (née Patterson), was a dietitian and nutritionist, and her father, Anthony Pantaleoni, was a corporate lawyer with the firm Fulbright &amp; Jaworski. Her paternal grandfather was of Italian, English, and Irish descent; he was a nephew of Italian economist and politician Maffeo Pantaleoni.

Leoni&#x27;s paternal grandmother, American silent film actress and humanitarian Helenka Adamowska Pantaleoni, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts to Polish musicians Józef Adamowski and Antonina Szumowska-Adamowska. Leoni&#x27;s mother is a native of Amarillo, Texas. She is a niece of actor Hank Patterson.

Leoni grew up in Englewood, New Jersey, and New York City, and attended two private schools, Brearley School and The Putney School in Vermont. She attended but did not complete studies at Sarah Lawrence College.

In a 2017 episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, hosted by Henry Louis Gates Jr., Leoni discovered that her mother Emily, who was adopted, is the biological daughter of Mavis Abilene Gindratt from Vick, Louisiana, and Sumpter James Daniel, whose ancestors originated in Ireland. The Daniels immigrated to Virginia in the early 18th century, and founded a farm in Fairfax County, seven miles from that of George Washington. Her mother&#x27;s adoptive parents were Florry Elizabeth (née Roberts) and Virgil Pearson Patterson.

==Career==
In 1988, Leoni was cast as one of the stars of &quot;Angels 88&quot;, an updated version of the 1970s show &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. After production delays, the show never aired. The following year, she was cast as Lisa DiNapoli in the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. In 1991, she made her film debut with a small role in the comedy &quot;Switch&quot; and later played another small part in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992).

From 1992 to 1993, Leoni starred with Corey Parker in the short-lived Fox sitcom &quot;Flying Blind&quot;. In February 1995, she appeared in the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, a spinoff from &quot;Cheers&quot;, as the fiancée of Sam Malone (played by Ted Danson). 

Later in that year, she landed the lead role in the ABC/NBC sitcom &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;, playing Nora Wilde, a tabloid news journalist. The show ran through 1998. She was also offered the role of Rachel Green on the hit sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, which she had turned down in favor of &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;. Leoni had the female lead role in the 1995 action comedy film &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, which was a box office success, grossing over $141 million worldwide.

After leaving television, Leoni had a leading role in &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998), a big-budget disaster film featuring projected effects of a comet hurtling towards Earth. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a success at the box office, grossing $349 million worldwide. She later had main roles in two other big budget movies: romantic comedy &quot;The Family Man&quot; (2000), co-starring alongside Nicolas Cage, and science fiction film &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; (2001) as William H. Macy&#x27;s character&#x27;s ex-wife. In 2002, she starred as a film studio executive in &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot;, directed by Woody Allen and had a supporting role in the box office bomb crime drama &quot;People I Know&quot;. In 2004, she appeared as the wife of Adam Sandler&#x27;s character in the financially unsuccessful comedy-drama &quot;Spanglish&quot;. In 2005, Leoni starred alongside Jim Carrey in the comedy film &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;. The movie grossed $202 million at the box office worldwide.

Leoni co-starred in a number of small films in the late 2000s, including &quot;You Kill Me&quot; and &quot;The Smell of Success&quot;. She co-starred opposite Ricky Gervais in the 2008 supernatural comedy-drama &quot;Ghost Town&quot;. In 2011, she had a supporting role in the heist comedy film, &quot;Tower Heist&quot;. In 2011, she was also cast alongside Hope Davis as leads in the HBO comedy pilot, &quot;Spring/Fall&quot;; however, the pilot was not picked up. 

Leoni starred as Elizabeth McCord in the CBS political drama &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;, which ran from September 21, 2014, to December 8, 2019.

==Personal life==
Leoni married Neil Joseph Tardio Jr., a television commercial producer, on June 8, 1991, at St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Hope Township, New Jersey. They divorced in 1995.

Leoni married actor David Duchovny on May 13, 1997, after an eight-week courtship. They have two children, daughter Madelaine West Duchovny and a son Kyd Miller Duchovny. In 2008, Leoni and Duchovny separated. Duchovny received treatment for sex addiction from August to October. The couple reconciled in 2009 but separated again in June 2011. Duchovny filed for divorce in June 2014, and the couple had agreed to settlement terms by that August. 

After splitting from Duchovny, Leoni moved to Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side of New York City. Leoni began dating Tim Daly, her &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; co-star, in December 2014. They are both alumni of the Putney School.

===Humanitarian work===
Leoni was named a UNICEF goodwill ambassador in 2001. Helenka Pantaleoni, her paternal grandmother, was the president of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF for more than 25 years.

===Asteroid===
Asteroid 8299 Téaleoni, discovered by Eric Elst at La Silla in 1993, was named after Leoni.

<doc id="310306" wikidata="Q347935" url="?curid=310306" title="Taksony of Hungary">
<text>Taksony (, also Taxis or Tocsun; before or around 931 – early 970s) was the Grand Prince of the Hungarians after their catastrophic defeat in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld. In his youth he had participated in plundering raids in Western Europe, but during his reign the Hungarians only targeted the Byzantine Empire. The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; recounts that significant Muslim and Pecheneg groups settled in Hungary under Taksony.

==Early life==
Taksony was the son of Zoltán, according to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; (written around 1200). The same source adds that Taksony&#x27;s mother was an unnamed daughter of Menumorut, a local ruler defeated by the conquering Hungarians shortly before 907. Its unknown author also says that Taksony was born &quot;in the year of Our Lord&#x27;s incarnation 931&quot;. The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; reports that Zoltán abdicated in favor of Taksony in 947, three years before his own death.

However, modern historians have challenged existing information on Taksony&#x27;s early life. A nearly-contemporaneous source—Liudprand of Cremona&#x27;s &quot;Retribution&quot;—narrates that Taksony led a plundering raid against Italy in 947, which suggests that he was born considerably earlier than 931. His father&#x27;s reign was preserved only in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;; its anonymous author lists Zoltán among the grand princes, and all later Hungarian monarchs were descended from him. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus wrote around 950 that Fajsz, Taksony&#x27;s cousin, was grand prince of the Hungarians at that time.

==Reign==

A later source, Johannes Aventinus, writes that Taksony fought in the Battle of Lechfeld on August 10, 955. There, future Holy Roman Emperor Otto I routed an 8,000-strong Hungarian army. If this report is reliable, Taksony was one of the few Hungarian leaders to survive the battlefield. Modern historians, including Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó, suggest that Fajsz abdicated in favor of Taksony around that time. After that battle the Hungarians&#x27; plundering raids in Western Europe stopped, and they were forced to retreat from the lands between the Enns and Traisen rivers. However, the Hungarians continued their incursions into the Byzantine Empire until the 970s.

According to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, &quot;a great host of Muslims&quot; arrived in Hungary &quot;from the land of Bular&quot; under Taksony. The contemporaneous Ibrahim ibn Yaqub also recorded the presence of Muslim merchants from Hungary in Prague in 965. Anonymus also writes of the arrival of Pechenegs during Taksony&#x27;s reign; he granted them &quot;a land to dwell in the region of Kemej as far as the Tisza&quot;. The only sign of a Hungarian connection with Western Europe under Taksony is a report by Liudprand of Cremona. He writes about Zacheus, whom Pope John XII consecrated bishop and &quot;sent to the Hungarians in order to preach that they should attack&quot; the Germans in 963. However, there is no evidence that Zacheus ever arrived in Hungary. Taksony arranged the marriage of his elder son Géza to Sarolt, daughter of Gyula of Transylvania, before his death during the early 970s.

==Family==
Taksony&#x27;s marriage to a woman &quot;from the land of the Cumans&quot; was arranged by his father, according to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;. Although this reference to the Cumans is anachronistic, modern historians argue that the &quot;Gesta&quot; seems to have preserved the memory of the Turkic—Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian—origin of Taksony&#x27;s wife. Historian György Györffy proposes that a Pecheneg chieftain, Tonuzoba, who received estates from Taksony near the river Tisza, was related to Taksony&#x27;s wife. The names of two of Taksony&#x27;s sons (Géza and Michael) have been preserved. The following family tree presents Taksony&#x27;s ancestry and his offspring.




*Whether Menumorut is an actual or an invented person is debated by modern scholars.&lt;br&gt;**A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian woman&lt;br&gt;***Kristó writes that she may have been a member of the Rurik dynasty from Kievan Rus&#x27;.

<text>Zoltán (; 880 or 903 – 950), also Zolta, Zsolt, Solt or Zaltas is mentioned in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; as the third Grand Prince of the Hungarians who succeeded his father Árpád around 907. Although modern historians tend to deny this report on his reign, because other chronicles do not list him among the Hungarian rulers, there is consensus that even if Zoltán never ascended the throne, all monarchs ruling in Hungary from the House of Árpád after around 955 were descended from him.

==Life==
===Zoltán in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;===
Modern historians&#x27; main source of Zoltán&#x27;s life is the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, a late 12th-century chronicle whose writer is now known as Anonymus. According to this source, Zoltán was the only son of Árpád, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. In contrast, the nearly contemporary Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus writes that &quot;Zaltas&quot; was Árpád&#x27;s fourth son. Zoltán&#x27;s name seemingly derived from the Arabian sultan title with Turkic mediation, but modern scholars have not unanimously accepted this etymology.

According to Anonymus, Zoltán was born after 903, during his father&#x27;s second campaign against Menumorut. The latter was one of the many local rulers who are solely mentioned in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; among the opponents of the Hungarians during their conquest of the Carpathian Basin. In the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; narration, Menumorut was forced to surrender and to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltán in 904 or 905. When Menumorut died, Zoltán inherited his father-in-law&#x27;s duchy east of the river Tisza, which Anonymus claims was inhabited by &quot;the peoples that are called Kozár&quot;. Anonymus also states that Zoltán, still a minor, succeeded his father who died around 907. Zoltán, in turn, later abdicated in favour of his son Taksony and died &quot;in the third year of his son&#x27;s reign&quot;.

===Modern historians&#x27; views===

Nowadays historians reject most details of Zoltán&#x27;s life presented by Anonymus. For instance, the Hungarian historian Gyula Kristó says that Zoltán was born around 880 instead of around 903. His Romanian colleague Alexandru Madgearu likewise writes that either Zoltán was born many years earlier than 903 or his marriage must have happened years after 904.

Zoltán&#x27;s father-in-law&#x27;s identity is also debated. Medievalist Pál Engel says that Menumorut is one of the &quot;imaginary figures&quot; invented by Anonymus in order to describe the conquering Hungarians&#x27; heroic wars against them. Historian Charles R. Bowlus writes that he was a Moravian ruler whose daughter&#x27;s marriage with Zoltán symbolized the end of &quot;Great Moravia&quot;. Medievalist Tudor Sălăgean also says that Menumorut was a real person, the ruler of a one-time duchy inhabited by Romanians, Slavs and many other peoples at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries.

Anonymus&#x27;s statement that Zoltán succeeded his father as grand prince, or even the idea that Zoltán ever ruled the federation of the Hungarian tribes have also been challenged. For instance, historian Sándor L. Tóth points that Zoltán, being the youngest among Árpád&#x27;s four sons, could hardly precede his elder brothers in the line of succession. Kristó also says that other Hungarian chroniclers do not make mention of Zoltán&#x27;s rule, implying that Anonymus only inserted Zoltán into the incompletely preserved list of the grand princes because he knew that all Hungarian monarchs from the House of Árpád descended from him.

==Family==
The following is a family tree presenting Zoltán&#x27;s closest-known relatives:

<text>The white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) is a marine mammal belonging to the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) in the suborder Odontoceti (toothed whales).

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by the British taxonomist John Edward Gray in 1846. Due to its relative abundance in European waters, it was among the first of the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; (&quot;lagenos&quot;, Latin for &quot;bottle&quot; or &quot;flask&quot;; &quot;rhynchos&quot;, &quot;beak&quot; or &quot;snout&quot;) to be known to science. Its specific name, &quot;albirostris&quot;, translates to &quot;white beak&quot;, a reference to the color of the species&#x27; beak, a diagnostic (albeit variable) trait useful in identification.

==Description==

The white-beaked dolphin is a robust species of dolphin with a short beak. Adults can reach long and weigh . Calves are long at birth and probably weigh about . The upper body and flanks are dark grey with light grey patches, including a &#x27;saddle&#x27; behind the dorsal fin, while the underside is light grey to almost white in color. The flippers, fluke, and the tall, falcate, dorsal fin are all a darker grey than the body. As the common name implies, the beak is usually white in color, but it may be a dark, ashy grey, in some older individuals.

White-beaked dolphins have 25 to 28 teeth in each jaw, although the three teeth closest to the front of the mouth are often not visible, failing to erupt from the gums. They have up to 92 vertebrae, more than any other species of oceanic dolphin. Although the young are born with two to four whiskers on each side of the upper lip, these disappear as they grow, and, as in other odontocetes, the adults are entirely hairless. The humerus of the right flipper has been recorded as being longer and more robust than that on the left, indicating a degree of lateralized behavior.

==Distribution and habitat==

The white-beaked dolphin is endemic to the cold temperate and subarctic waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, most commonly in seas less than deep. They are found in a band stretching across the ocean from Cape Cod, the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and southern Greenland in the west, around Iceland in the centre, and across in the west from northern France to Svalbard; however, they are not well adapted to truly Arctic conditions. Due to the fact they are not fully adapted to Arctic conditions, they are more vulnerable to predators, most notably polar bears. Within this wider region, white-beaked dolphins are most commonly found in four locales: on the Labrador Shelf close to southwestern Greenland, around Iceland, off the northern and eastern coasts of Britain, and off the coast of Norway. In the Faroe Islands between Iceland and the United Kingdom the White-beaked dolphin is at risk of being hunted during drive catches of the long-finned pilot whales. They may also be incidentally trapped in the purse-sein and trawl nets of the area. There are no recognised subspecies.

The dolphin may easily be misidentified as the Atlantic white-sided dolphin, although the white-beaked is commonly found further north. The white-beaked dolphin is also typically larger, and does not have yellow streaks on its side.

==Biology and behavior==

The population, breeding pattern, and life expectancy of the dolphin are all unknown, although most sources estimate several hundred thousand individuals, more densely populated in the eastern North Atlantic than the west.

White-beaked dolphins feed predominantly on gadoid fishes, particularly cod, haddock, and whiting. They are social animals, most commonly found in groups of less than ten, but sometimes in much larger associations of over a hundred individuals. Their sonar clicks have a peak frequency of 115 kHz, while their social whistles are at around 35 kHz, and can be audible to others of their species at distances of up to .

White-beaked dolphins are acrobatic; they will frequently ride on the bow wave of high-speed boats and jump clear of the sea&#x27;s surface. Although they are normally much slower, they can swim at up to and can dive to at least depth. They are social feeders and have frequently been observed feeding with killer, fin, and humpback whales, as well as other dolphin species.

Mating probably takes place in the summer, with calves being born in the following year, between June and September. Females reach their adult size at around five years of age, and are sexually mature at six to ten years, while males reach adult size at around ten years, and reach sexual maturity about two years later than females.

==Conservation==
The North and Baltic Sea populations of the white-beaked dolphin are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since they have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

In addition, the white-beaked dolphin is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS).

<doc id="310315" wikidata="Q7770679" url="?curid=310315" title="The Tube (1982 TV series)">
<text>The Tube is a United Kingdom music television programme, which ran for five series, from 5 November 1982 to 24 April 1987. It was filmed in Newcastle upon Tyne and produced for Channel 4 by Tyne Tees Television, which had previously produced the similar music show &quot;Alright Now&quot; and the music-oriented youth show &quot;Check it Out&quot; for ITV; production of the latter ended in favour of &quot;The Tube&quot;.

&quot;The Tube&quot; was presented live by hosts including Jools Holland, Paula Yates, Leslie Ash, Muriel Gray, Gary James, Mark Miwurdz (Mark Hurst), Michel Cremona, Felix Howard, Tony Fletcher, Nick Laird-Clowes and Mike Everitt. The show was directed by Gavin Taylor; Geoff Wonfor directed some of the insert videos along with other staff programme director of Tyne Tees Television Martin Cairns. Many other specials were made, including one for the eve of the millennium.

The brand name was relaunched by Channel 4 as an online radio station in November 2006.

==Showcase for contemporary bands==
&quot;The Tube&quot; was a showcase for many emerging 1980s bands. Sunderland band The Toy Dolls were the first band to play live on The Tube.

&quot;The Tube&quot; was an important outlet for the performers. For The Proclaimers, performing &quot;Letter from America&quot; on &quot;The Tube&quot; was instrumental in helping the Scottish duo to their first top ten UK hit; it was also responsible for introducing Frankie Goes to Hollywood to their record label ZTT and its co-owner, and their producer Trevor Horn.

In addition to being the launchpad for new and upcoming performers, &quot;The Tube&quot; became known for its high-profile music performance &#x27;scoops&#x27; from established world class musicians such as U2 live at Red Rocks, Madonna, Robert Plant, Tina Turner, Bo Diddley and ZZ Top. The show was also fortunate to persuade Ringo Starr to give one of the first post-Beatles interviews in an extended article on his work with Marc Bolan and T. Rex, filmed at his then (and previously John Lennon&#x27;s) house, Tittenhurst Park. Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour appeared on an episode of the second series, recorded on 30th March 1984 as part of his first solo tour. It was during the 50th show in November 1984 that Bob Geldof allegedly ran into Midge Ure and suggested the idea of a fund-raising single for the Christmas market to help the Ethiopian famine, the project that would become Band Aid and later Live Aid.

The Jam performed on the first edition of the show in 1982, it was their last live TV appearance together before they split up at the end of the year. 

Dire Straits featured prominently in the fourth series, during which time they were promoting their 1985 album &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. The band performed and were interviewed in Israel on the 6 December 1985 episode, followed by a live performance on the 20 December show. The first episode of 1986 (transmitted on 3 January) was a one off special in which Dire Straits performed excerpts from their 10 July 1985 concert at Wembley Arena in London, one 13 consecutive concerts during their 1985–1986 Brothers in Arms world tour.

Half Man Half Biscuit famously turned down the chance to appear on the show, as Tranmere Rovers were playing that night, even though Channel Four offered to fly them by helicopter to the game.

==Format==
The cornerstone of the shows was the live performances from three or four bands each week. In an era where most music TV shows featured non-stop miming, the fully live sets by the guest artists were innovative (but the sound mix was often very poor, with a curious quality that made it sound like everything had been &#x27;phased&#x27;). The programme would start with a 45-minute magazine section consisting of interviews, fashion items and comedy appearances by a wide range of alternative artistes such as Frank Sidebottom, Alexei Sayle, Vic Reeves (before his association with Bob Mortimer), Foffo Spearjig and French &amp; Saunders.

The main presenters were supported, for the first two series, by five newcomers who were picked following a nationally advertised competition: these were Muriel Gray, Gary James, Nick Laird-Clowes, Michel Cremona and Mike Everitt. The supporting presenters took turns to co-present. Sheffield-born comedian Mark Hurst was also present during the first two series delivering comic monologues in the guise of performance poet Mark Miwurdz. Yates was absent throughout the second series as she was on maternity leave, and was replaced by Leslie Ash. Ash, however, was hospitalised before the second episode, and was replaced by Tony Fletcher. When Ash returned, Fletcher was also retained for the remainder of the second series, but both left on Yates&#x27; return.

The show usually featured four or five band appearances per week, with one main extended session to close. The format of the show was extended following Series 1 with a number of special events - most notably &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Tube&quot; (1984), a 5-hour version broadcast live from the Tyne Tees studios, the pub across the road from the studios and The Hoppings annual fair in Newcastle. This ground breaking broadcast was, at the time, the longest continuous live music show in television history and received much critical and technical acclaim.

Studio 5 was also used to produce a spin-off show called &quot;TX45&quot;. This show ran for two series hosted by Chris Cowey and produced by Jeff Brown and featured local bands such as The Kane Gang, Caught in the Act, Secret Sam and President. The programme&#x27;s theme music, the instrumental &quot;TX45&quot;, was by Sophie and Peter Johnston, based on the song of theirs, &quot;Some Sunny Day&quot;. A video clip of them performing it is available.

Many stars drank in the neighbouring pub &quot;The Egypt Cottage&quot;, using it as a green room. Jools Holland said &quot;A legendary amount of things happened in the Egypt Cottage, and the Rose and Crown when it was on the other side of the road. Everyone – the likes of Miles Davis, Paul McCartney – who came up for &quot;The Tube&quot; will have sat in that pub.&quot; The pub was demolished in 2009.

Between 1986 and 1987, the series had a summer replacement named &quot;Wired&quot; which lasted two series.

==Demise==
On 16 January 1987, during the fifth series, Jools Holland used the phrase &quot;be there or be ungroovy fuckers&quot; during a live trailer for the show. The incident caused a national scandal, as the trailer was transmitted on ITV at 5:15pm (during peak children&#x27;s viewing time) and the show was taken off air for three weeks as a result. Holland was reprimanded by Channel 4, as he had also previously sworn on the live show itself. The show&#x27;s producer, Malcolm Gerrie, and Tyne Tees&#x27; Director of Programmes, Andrea Wonfor, announced their resignations in March. They cited as reasons for doing so a mixture of internal bickering, political pressure and &quot;stifling bureaucracy and heavy-handed moralism&quot;.

A further series was never commissioned. Some people close to the show had said Holland&#x27;s swearing was seen as a convenient excuse for ending the show. The presenters&#x27; live interviews and filmed magazine items were nervously watched by the show&#x27;s producers and editors as well as Channel 4 executives, especially when certain pop stars and celebrities not known for their shy and retiring nature were being featured. It was this that gave the show the curious feeling of &#x27;anything might happen&#x27; that actually made it the success it was.

For Holland, Yates and Gray it was the launch pad for successful careers in television.

In 1999, &quot;The Tube&quot; was brought back for a one-off live special on Sky1 entitled &quot;The Apocalypse Tube&quot;. Hosted by BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Chris Moyles and Donna Air, the show came live again from Studio 5 at Tyne Tees and the bar of the Egypt Cottage next door.
On 2 July 2005, Tyne Tees Television moved from its Television Centre studios on Newcastle Quayside. In July 2006, Studio 5 of the TTTV City Road site was leased by an evangelical money church, and the whole complex was demolished in 2010. The famous Tube neon sign was bought at auction by Tyne and Wear Museums for a future display at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle&#x27;s Blandford Square.

==Radio revival==
In November 2006, the brand was revived as a radio show, also entitled &quot;The Tube&quot; for Channel 4 Radio. Presenters Konnie Huq, Alex James and Tony Wilson hosted the main show (&quot;The Tube&quot;) and filler show (&quot;Mind The Gap&quot;).

==Available on the Internet==
In July 2008 ITN (rights holder for &quot;The Tube&quot;) signed a deal with MUZU TV to make &quot;The Tube&quot; available online.

<text>Franz Joseph Gall or Franz Josef Gall (; 9 March 175822 August 1828) was a German neuroanatomist, physiologist, and pioneer in the study of the localization of mental functions in the brain.

Claimed as the founder of the pseudoscience of phrenology, Gall was an early and important researcher in his fields. His contributions to the field of neuropsychology were controversial at the time and are now widely referred to as pseudoscience. However, Gall&#x27;s study of phrenology helped establish psychology, contributed to the emergence of the naturalistic approach to the study of man, and played an important part in the development of evolutionist theories, anthropology, and sociology.

== Early life ==

Gall was born in the village of Tiefenbronn to a wealthy Roman Catholic wool merchant. The Galls, originally a noble family from Lombardy, had been the leading family in the area for over a century. His father was the mayor of Tiefenbronn and he was one of 12 children, only 7 of whom lived to adulthood.

Gall&#x27;s scientific inquiry began in his youth. As a boy, he was fascinated by the differences between himself, his siblings, and his classmates. He developed an early interest in the brain after making a connection between one classmate&#x27;s odd shaped skull and advanced language abilities. It is being said, that his first ideas about functional localization came from noticing that classmates who excelled at memory tasks had prominent facial features. He enjoyed collecting and categorizing plants and animals. He also realized the importance of observation as a scientific technique at a young age.

== Education and early career ==

As the second eldest son, he was intended for the priesthood but chose instead to study medicine at the University of Strasbourg. In his advanced studies, he again made observations about his classmates. He noticed that many of the particularly bright students had prominent eyeballs and concluded that this could not be purely coincidental.

He later completed his degree in Vienna, Austria. While in medical school, he studied under Johann Hermann and Maximilian Stoll who impressed upon him the importance of natural observation. He took his first job at Lunatic Asylum making observations about the insane. He then opened up his own successful private practice and became so popular he even gave well attended lectures to the public. He was offered the position as head Austrian Court physician but decided to remain in private practice and research.

== Contributions to phrenology ==

Based on his early observations about the skull sizes and facial features of his classmates, Gall developed the theory of Organology and the method of Cranioscopy that would later be known as Phrenology. Gall&#x27;s version of Organology states that the mind is a collection of independent entities housed within the brain. Cranioscopy is a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. During his lifetime, Gall collected and observed over 120 skulls in order to test his hypotheses.

Gall believed that the bumps and uneven geography of the human skull were caused by pressure exerted from the brain underneath. He divided the brain into sections that corresponded to certain behaviors and traits that he called fundamental faculties. This is referred to as localization of function. Gall believed there were 27 fundamental faculties, among them were: recollection of people, mechanical ability, talent for poetry, love of property, and even a murder instinct. Based on the surface of a person&#x27;s skull, Gall could make assumptions about that person&#x27;s fundamental faculties and therefore their character.

Gall disagreed with Philippe Pinel and Peter Camper that the larger brain the larger one&#x27;s intellectual power. However, after numerous dissections and observations he was able to assert that a mature skull under 14 inches in circumference was not able to function normally.

== Relationship with Johann Spurzheim ==

In 1800, Johann Spurzheim attended one of Gall&#x27;s public lectures and was hired as an assistant to help with public medical demonstrations. In 1804, he became Gall&#x27;s full-time research partner. They worked together for years to develop theories about brain localization and function. In 1813, Spurzheim separated from Gall in order to make a name for himself in Britain. Gall would later accuse Spurzheim of plagiarism and perverting his work. It was Spurzheim who would give the name phrenology to Gall&#x27;s theories.

== Other achievements ==

Other than his contributions to phrenology, Gall is lesser known for his other achievements. While developing his theories on localization of function, Gall significantly advanced the science of dissection. Instead of slicing randomly, as had been the practice in previous years, Gall&#x27;s method involved slow exploration of the entire brain structure and the separation of individual fibers. This shift in methodology was extremely influential in future discoveries of the brain.

Gall also researched and theorized about language, communication, and the brain. He argued that pantomime, or the science of gesture, was a universal language for all animals and humans. He believed every living thing was born with the ability to understand gestures on some level.

In 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He published a book titled &quot;On the Functions of the Brain and of Each of Its parts: With Observations on the Possibility of Determining the Instincts, Propensities, and Talents, Or the Moral and Intellectual Dispositions of Men and Animals, by the Configuration of the Brain and Head&quot; detailing his vast research on brain function and localization. It was translated to English in 1835 by Lewis Winslow.

== Reception and controversy ==

Gall&#x27;s concepts on brain localization were revolutionary, and led to many religious leaders and scientists to take exception to his theories. The Catholic Church considered his theory as contrary to the established tenets of Catholicism. Established science also condemned these ideas for lack of scientific proof of his theory. Still others attempted to discredit Gall because they believed he had not given rightful credit to the theories and scientists who influenced him. French scientist Étienne-Jean Georget accused Gall of stealing Charles Bonnet&#x27;s basic idea of brain localization that he had written about over 60 years earlier.

His ideas were also not acceptable to the court of Emperor Joseph II (the brother of Marie Antoinette). The Austrian government accused Gall of being a materialist and banned his ideas because of their threat to public morality. Due to this opposition, Gall left his lecturer position in Austria. He sought a teaching position in Germany and eventually settled in Paris. Revolutionary France was most likely the most hospitable place for Gall&#x27;s theories. However, Napoleon Bonaparte, the ruling emperor, and the scientific establishment led by the Institute of France, pronounced his science as invalid. Despite all this, Gall was able to secure a comfortable existence on the basis of his speciality. He became a celebrity of sorts as he was accepted into Parisian intellectual salons.

Physiologist Jean Pierre Flourens emerged as one of the sharpest critics of Gall&#x27;s theories, testing them on animals by removing portions of the brains of dogs, rabbits, and birds to examine how the remaining sections functioned. Flourens published his findings in two separate articles, attacking Gall&#x27;s theory that the brain acted as discrete parts instead of as a whole unit. One interesting influence was on psychiatry, where the South Italian psychiatrist Biagio Gioacchino Miraglia proposed a new classification of mental illness based on brain functions as they were conceived in Gall&#x27;s phrenology.

== Legacy ==

In spite of many problems associated with his work, Gall made significant contributions to the field of neurological science. He died in Paris, on 22 August 1828. Although married, he remained childless. Some direct descendants of his brothers lived in Germany until 1949. A collection of his skulls can be seen at the Rollett Museum in Baden bei Wien, Austria, where several of his relatives now live.

Today, phrenology is thought of as a huge mis-step by the scientific community. The idea that a person&#x27;s personality could be determined by the shape of their skull has been repeatedly disproven. But at the time, Gall&#x27;s arguments were persuasive and intriguing. Even though phrenology is now known to be incorrect, Gall did set the groundwork for modern neuroscience by spreading the idea of functional localization within the brain.

The misuse of Gall&#x27;s ideas and work to justify discrimination were deliberately furthered by his associates, including Johann Spurzheim. Later, others tried to improve on his theories with systems such as characterology.

Gall&#x27;s theories had an influence both on the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso and on his French rival, Alexandre Lacassagne. He also influenced the French anatomist, Paul Broca.

<text>Árpád (; 845 – 907) was the head of the confederation of the Magyar tribes at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. He might have been either the sacred ruler or &quot;kende&quot; of the Hungarians, or their military leader or &quot;gyula&quot;, although most details of his life are debated by historians, because different sources contain contradictory information. Despite this, many Hungarians refer to him as the &quot;founder of our country&quot;, and Árpád&#x27;s preeminent role in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin has been emphasized by some later chronicles. The dynasty descending from Árpád ruled the Kingdom of Hungary until 1301.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Árpád was the son of Álmos who is mentioned as the first head of the confederation of the Magyar tribes by all Hungarian chronicles. His mother&#x27;s name and family are unknown. According to historian Gyula Kristó, Árpád was born around 845. His name derived from the Hungarian word for barley, &quot;árpa&quot;.

The Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (r. 913–959) states that the Hungarians &quot;had never at any time had any other prince&quot; before Árpád, which is in sharp contrast to the Hungarian chronicles&#x27; report of the position of Árpád&#x27;s father. In Porphyrogenitus&#x27;s narration, the Khazar khagan initiated the centralization of the command of the Hungarian tribes in order to strengthen his own suzerainty over them. The khagan initially wanted to appoint a chieftain named Levedi to lead the Hungarians. However, Levedi did not accept this offer and suggested that either Álmos or Árpád should be promoted instead of him. The khagan approached the Hungarians with this new proposal. They preferred Árpád to his father, because he was &quot;greatly admired for wisdom and counsel and valour, and capable of this rule&quot;. Thereafter, Árpád was made &quot;prince according to the custom ... of the Chazars, by lifting him upon a shield.&quot; Constantine Porphyrogenitus erroneously refers to the Magyars as Turks. This was a misnomer, as while the Magyars do have some Turkic genetic and cultural influence, and their historical social structure was of Turkic origin, they are not a Turkic people.

The reliability of the Byzantine emperor&#x27;s report of Árpád&#x27;s election is debated by modern historians: for instance, Victor Spinei states that it is &quot;rather vague and scarcely credible&quot;, but András Róna-Tas writes that its core is reliable. The latter historian adds that Árpád&#x27;s election was promoted by Álmos, who forced Levedi to renounce his position as &quot;kende&quot;. Accordingly, in Róna-Tas&#x27;s view, Árpád succeeded Levedi as sacred ruler, or &quot;kende&quot;, which enabled his father to preserve his own position as the actual leader of the Hungarians, or &quot;gyula&quot;.

===Towards the Hungarian Conquest===

The earliest reliable source of Árpád&#x27;s life is an early 10th-century document, the &quot;Continuation of the Chronicle by George the Monk&quot;. It narrates that the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912) sent his envoy Nicetas Sclerus to the Hungarians in 894 or 895 &quot;to give presents&quot; and incite them against the Bulgarian Empire. Sclerus met with their two leaders, Árpád and Kurszán, at the Lower Danube. Sclerus&#x27;s mission succeeded: a Hungarian army soon crossed the Danube on Byzantine ships against Bulgaria. An interpolation in Porphyrogenitus&#x27;s text suggests that the invading Hungarians were under the command of Árpád&#x27;s son, Liüntika.

The positions held by Árpád and Kurszán at the time of their negotiations with Sclerus are debated by historians. Spinei wrote that Árpád was the &quot;gyula&quot;, and Kurszán was the &quot;kende&quot;. In contrast, Kristó said that Kurszán was the &quot;gyula&quot; and Árpád represented his father, Álmos &quot;kende&quot;. 


The Hungarian army defeated the Bulgarians, but the latter hired the Pechenegs against them. The Bulgarians and Pechenegs simultaneously invaded the Hungarians&#x27; territories in the western regions of the Pontic steppes in 895 or 896. The destruction of their dwelling places by the Pechenegs forced the Hungarians to leave for a new homeland across the Carpathian Mountains towards the Pannonian Plain.

The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; says that Árpád&#x27;s father Álmos &quot;could not enter Pannonia, for he was killed in Erdelw&quot; or Transylvania. Engel, Kristó and Molnár, who accept the reliability of this report, wrote that Álmos&#x27;s death was a ritual murder, similar to the sacrifice of the Khazar khagans in case of a disaster affecting their people. In contrast with them, Róna-Tas states that even if the report on Álmos&#x27;s murder &quot;reflects true event, the only possible explanation would be that Árpád or someone in his entourage&quot; killed the aged prince. Spinei rejects the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s report on Álmos&#x27;s murder in Transylvania, because the last mention of Álmos in the contrasting narration of the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; is connected to a siege of Ungvár (Uzhhorod, Ukraine) by the Hungarians. The latter chronicle says that Álmos appointed Árpád &quot;as leader and master&quot; of the Hungarians on this occasion.

===Reign===

Árpád&#x27;s name &quot;is completely unknown&quot; to all sources written in East Francia, which was one of the main powers of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. These sources, including the &quot;Annales Alamannici&quot; and the &quot;Annales Eisnidlenses&quot;, only mention another Hungarian leader, Kurszán. According to Kristó and other historians, these sources suggest that Kurszán must have been the &quot;gyula&quot; commanding the Hungarian forces, while Árpád succeeded his murdered father as the sacred &quot;kende&quot;. Proposing a contrasting theory, the Romanian historian Curta wrote that Kurszán was the &quot;kende&quot; and Árpád &quot;gyula&quot; only succeeded him when Kurszán was murdered by Bavarians in 902 or 904.

In contrast to nearly contemporaneous sources, Hungarian chronicles written centuries after the eventsfor instance, the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; and the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;emphasize Árpád&#x27;s pre-eminent role in the conquest of the Carpathian Basin. The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; also highlights Árpád&#x27;s military skills and his generosity. This chronicle also emphasizes that Tétény, one of the heads of the seven Hungarian tribes, acquired &quot;the land of Transylvania for himself and his posterity&quot; only after Árpád had authorized him to conquer it.

The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; says that Árpád took &quot;an oath of the leading men and warriors of Hungary,&quot; and &quot;had his son, Prince Zoltán elevated&quot; to prince in his life. However, the reliability of this report and the list of the grand princes in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; is dubious. For instance, it ignores Fajsz, who ruled when Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus was completing his &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; around 950.

===Death===

The date of Árpád&#x27;s death is debated. The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; states that he died in 907. However, Kristó wrote that he actually died in 900 or later because the &quot;Gesta&quot; says 903 is the starting date of the Hungarian &quot;land-taking&quot; instead of its actual date around 895. If the &quot;Gesta&quot;&#x27;s report on his funeral is reliable, Árpád was buried &quot;at the head of a small river that flows through a stone culvert to the city of King Attila&quot; where a village, Fehéregyháza, developed near Buda a century later.

==Legacy==
The Hungarians arrived in their new homeland within the Carpathians under Árpád. Árpád is the principal actor in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, which attributes &quot;almost all memorable events&quot; of the &quot;Hungarian land-taking&quot; to him. Furthermore, until the extinction of the male line of his dynasty in 1301, Hungary was ruled by &quot;a single line of princes&quot;, all descending from Árpád. Árpád is known among Hungarians as &quot;honalapító&quot; or the &quot;founder of our homeland&quot;.

==Family==

Porphyrogenitus says Árpád &quot;had four sons: first, &quot;Tarkatzous&quot;; second, &quot;Ielech&quot;; third, &quot;Ioutotzas&quot;; fourth, &quot;Zaltas&quot;. However, he also refers to one &quot;Liuntikas&quot;, son of&quot; Árpád; Kristó wrote that Liuntikas (Liüntika) was an alternative name of Tarkatzous (Tarhos). The name and family of the mother of Árpád&#x27;s sons are unknown. The following is a family tree presenting Árpád&#x27;s ancestors and his descendants to the end of the 10th century:






&quot;*Liüntika and Tarkatzus are supposed to have been identical.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;**The father of Tas was one of Árpád&#x27;s four or five sons, but his name is unknown.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;***All later grand princes and kings of Hungary descended from Taksony.&quot;

<text>The New Zealand state highway network is the major national highway network in New Zealand. Nearly 100 roads in the North and South Islands are state highways. All state highways are administered by the NZ Transport Agency.

The highways were originally designated using a two-tier system, national (SH 1 to 8) and provincial, with national highways having a higher standard and funding priorities. Now all are state highways, and the network consists of SH 1 running the length of both islands, SH 2 to 5 and 10 to 59 in the North Island, and SH 6 to 8 and 60 to 99 in the South Island, numbered approximately north to south. State highways are marked by red shield-shaped signs with white numbering (shields for the former provincial highways were blue). Road maps usually number state highways in this fashion.

Of the total state highway network, New Zealand currently has of motorways and expressways with grade-separated access and they carry ten percent of all New Zealand traffic. The majority of the state highway network is made up of single-carriageway roads with one lane each way and at-grade access.

==History ==
In the early days all roads were managed by local road boards. Initially they were set up by the Provinces. For example, Auckland Province passed a Highways Act in 1862 allowing their Superintendent to define given areas of settlement as Highways Districts, each with a board of trustees elected by the landowners. Land within the boundaries of highway districts became subject to a rate of not more than 1/- an acre, or of 3d in the £ of its estimated sale value and that was to be equalled by a grant from the Province. By 1913 the government was collecting £21,000 in duty on cars, but spending £40,000 on roads.

The idea of a national network of highways did not emerge until the early twentieth century, when a series of pieces of legislation was passed to allow for the designation of main highways (starting with the Main Highways Act 1922, followed by gazetting of roads) and state highways (in 1936). This saw the National Roads Board, an arm of the Ministry of Works, responsible for the state highway network.

From 1989 to 2008, state highways were the responsibility of Transit New Zealand, a Crown entity. In 1996 the funding of the network was removed from the operational functions with the creation of Transfund New Zealand, which then merged with the Land Transport Safety Authority to create Land Transport New Zealand. That was done to ensure that funding of state highways was considered on a similar basis to funding for local roads and regional council subsidised public transport. In August 2008, Transit and Land Transport NZ merged to become the NZ Transport Agency.

Every five years the NZ Transport Agency will embark on a state highway review to consider whether the existing network should be expanded or reduced, according to traffic flows, changes in industry, tourism and development.

From 2009 many new road schemes were classed as Roads of National Significance and, from 2020, as part of the New Zealand Upgrade Programme.

== Classification ==
Since 2013, the NZTA has used the One Network Road Classification (ONRC) system to classify state highways and local roads. There are five categories for state highways, with an additional sixth category (Access) used only by local roads. The categories are as follows:

*National: Generally these roads link the country&#x27;s largest urban areas (population greater than 100,000) major ports and major airports. They generally have an annual average daily traffic volume (AADT) of 15,000 or more. Examples includes most of SH 1, SH 29, the Wellington–Palmerston North–Napier route (SH 57, SH 3, SH 2, SH 50A and SH 50) and most State Highways in the Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch urban areas.
*Regional: Generally these roads link the country&#x27;s main urban areas (population greater than 30,000), medium-sized ports, medium-sized airports, and major tourist destinations, or are the major route linking an isolated region. They generally have an AADT of 10,000 or more. Examples include most of SH 2 and SH 3, SH 5, SH 73, and Queenstown–Milford Sound route (SH 6, SH 97 and SH 94).
*Arterial: Generally these roads link the country&#x27;s secondary urban areas (population greater than 10,000), medium-sized ports and regional airports, or are the only route linking an isolated area or provide an important detour function. They generally have an AADT of 3000 or more. Examples includes most of SH 6, SH 8, SH 27, and the SH 1 Desert Road detour (SH 46, SH 47, SH 4 and SH 49)
*Primary collector: Generally these roads link the country&#x27;s minor urban areas (population greater than 2000). They generally have an AADT of 1000 or more. Examples includes most of SH 4, SH 7, SH 35, and SH 83.
*Secondary collector: Generally these roads link rural towns (population less than 2000) or rural areas. They generally have an AADT of less than 1000. Examples include SH 43, SH 63, SH 85 and SH 87.

== Volumes ==
From 2006 information, the busiest stretch of SH 1 was just south of the Auckland Central Motorway Junction, on/near the Newmarket Viaduct, with over 200,000 vehicles (either way) each day. The least busy parts of the network (excluding off-ramps and on-ramps) are on SH 43 north-east of Whangamōmona, with fewer than 120 vehicles (counting both directions) in a day.

The only remaining unsealed sections of state highway are of SH 43 and of SH 38, though 38% of other roads remain unsealed.

Every year the New Zealand Transport Agency produces a booklet titled &quot;AADT Data&quot;, average annualised daily traffic, that gives traffic volumes on all state highways from their automated vehicle recording system.

==Distance markers==
State highways are marked with posts at irregular intervals giving the distance in kilometres from the start of the highway. Until recently, all bridges on the network had at each end a small plaque showing the distance from the start of the highway, usually in the form of a number in kilometres, an oblique stroke, and a further number in kilometres, accurate to the nearest 10 metres. A plaque marked 237/14.12, for example, indicated that the bridge was past a set distance post, that post being from the start of the highway. In about 2004 these plaques were replaced by a new system, which gives each bridge a single number showing the distance from the start of the highway in hundreds of metres. Under the new system the bridge above would be numbered 2511, as it is  km from the start of the highway. Motorway on- and off-ramps are numbered using the same system.

In this way, travellers can accurately assess their location, and road authorities can identify each bridge uniquely.

Sometimes, houses with RAPID numbering can also be used to determine the position. For example, house number 1530 is from the start of the highway.

==Safety==
In early 2008, Transit New Zealand unveiled KiwiRAP (the New Zealand Road Assessment Programme) in cooperation with other government agencies and the New Zealand Automobile Association. The system, based on similar programs overseas, categorises New Zealand state highways according to the safety of discrete &#x27;links&#x27; (sections of the network, with a total of 10,856 km of highways separated into 172 links ranging in length from to ). These are graded according to their &#x27;individual risk&#x27; and their &#x27;collective risk&#x27; based on historical crash data and traffic volumes.

The individual risk is based on the likelihood of a single driver experiencing an accident while travelling the link in question. As of 2008, the three least safe sections of the network based on individual risk were State Highway 62 from Spring Creek to Renwick (Marlborough), State Highway 37 to Waitomo Caves and State Highway 94 from Te Anau to Milford Sound.

The collective risk is based on the total number of crashes that occurred on the link, which pushes safer but very highly travelled sections of the network to the top of the statistical category. As of 2008, the three least safe sections of the network based on collective risk were all on State Highway 2, on the sections from Napier to Hastings, Mount Maunganui to Paengaroa and Bay View to Napier.

Both categories of assessment are to be used as an advisory tool for both drivers to inform them of dangerous road sections as well as to allow traffic controlling authorities to prioritise maintenance and safety improvements.

The 2015–18 National Land Transport Programme aimed to invest $3.2bn (23% of the NLTP total) in safety, including $960m for policing, $132m for road safety promotion and $103m for rural SH safety. The &quot;Safe Roads Alliance&quot; is carrying out rural work on SH 1 (Waikato Expressway, Te Teko-Awakeri), SH 1B (Taupiri-Gordonton), SH 3 (Ohaupo-Te Awamutu, Waitomo-Te Kuiti), SH 11 (Airfield-Lily Pond), SH 12 (Dargaville-Tokatoka), SH 16 (Brigham Creek-Waimauku), SH 23 (Hamilton-Raglan), SH 27 (SH 26-SH 24) and SH 34 (SH 30 to Kawerau). The &quot;Alliance&quot; is using speed reductions, wire rope barriers, wide centrelines, rumble strips, better warning signs and shoulder widening.

==Specific sections==
===State Highway 1===
State Highway 1 can be considered as a single highway running the length of both main islands, broken in the middle by the ferry connection at Cook Strait. It connects six of the seven largest urban areas and includes the country&#x27;s busiest stretch of road.

===Touring routes===
Many sections of state highway provided are marketed as tourist highways, sometimes jointly with local roading providers. Transit maintains traffic signs on and near state highways to help promote these routes. These include:
* Twin Coast Discovery Highway – ring route around the Auckland and Northland regions.
* Pacific Coast Highway – route going around the north-east coast of the North Island, joining Auckland and Napier.
* Thermal Explorer Highway – route going from Auckland to Napier through the geothermally active centre of the North Island.
* Surf Highway – alternative name for SH 45 from New Plymouth to Hāwera. Named due to the number of surf breaks along the Taranaki coastline.
* Classic New Zealand Wine Trail – a route through three of New Zealand&#x27;s major wine regions, from Napier to Blenheim, via Hastings, Woodville, Masterton, Martinborough, Wellington, and Picton. Requires a ferry crossing across Cook Strait between Wellington and Picton.
* Alpine Pacific Triangle – a triangular loop including sections of SH 1, 7 and Route 70 () linking the popular destinations of Hanmer Springs, Kaikōura and Waipara.
* Inland Scenic Route – formerly SH 72, this road goes from Amberley to Winchester (near Timaru). This road follows around the foot of the Canterbury Foothills, inland on the Canterbury plains.
* Great Alpine Highway – Highway 73 going from Christchurch in Canterbury over the Southern Alps via Arthurs Pass to Kumara Junction on the West Coast.
* Southern Scenic Route – route going along the southern coast of the South Island from Dunedin via the Catlins, Invercargill and Riverton to Te Anau.
*Starlight Highway - route from Fairlie to Mt Cook in the Mackenzie District of Canterbury in the South Island. This route includes SH 80 and parts of SH 8. In recognition of the area being an international dark sky reserve (&quot;Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve&quot;).

<text>Rahaman Ali (born Rudolph Arnett Clay; July 18, 1943) is an American former heavyweight boxer. He is the younger brother of Muhammad Ali.

==Biography==
Rahaman Ali, initially named Rudolph Arnett Clay but later rechristened to Rudolph Valentino Clay, was born to Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. and Odessa Grady Clay on July 18, 1943, 18 months after his brother Cassius Jr., who would become Muhammad Ali. Muhammad started boxing in a Louisville, Kentucky amateur boxing league. While Muhammad went to the 1960 Olympics, Rahaman was not selected and remained amateur until February 25, 1964, the night his brother won one of his heavyweight titles over Sonny Liston.

As a professional boxer, Rahaman Ali won 14 bouts, lost 3, and had one draw. In his career, he knocked out seven opponents and was himself knocked out once. After back-to-back losses ending with him being knocked out by Jack O&#x27;Halloran, he retired from professional boxing.

In 2014, Ali released his autobiography, &quot;That&#x27;s Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Brother! My Life on the Undercard&quot;, which is co-authored by H. Ron Brashear and the foreword written by Gene Kilroy – the longtime business manager of Muhammad Ali. In 2019, Rahaman released his second book titled &quot;My Brother, Muhammad Ali - The Definitive Biography&quot;. It is co-authored by Fiaz Rafiq, with the foreword written by NFL legend Jim Brown. The book is currently published in eight different languages around the world.

<doc id="310323" wikidata="Q927402" url="?curid=310323" title="Reinventing the Steel">
<text>Reinventing the Steel is the ninth studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera, released on March 21, 2000 through Elektra Records and East West Records. This was the last studio album Pantera released before their nineteen-year breakup from November 2003 to July 2022, and it is the band&#x27;s final album to feature the Abbott brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul, before their deaths in 2004 and 2018, respectively.

==Background==
&quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; was produced by the Abbott brothers in addition to Sterling Winfield, making it Pantera&#x27;s first studio album since 1988&#x27;s &quot;Power Metal&quot; not to be produced by Terry Date.

In Australia, a two-disc &quot;Tour Edition&quot; of the album was released. The first disc consists of the album proper while the second is an unofficial hits compilation.

The album was reissued in October 2020 with extra discs including a new mix by Date and unreleased tracks to honor the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

Unlike other Pantera releases, two B-sides were recorded during the &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; sessions, those being &quot;Avoid the Light&quot; and &quot;Immortally Insane&quot;, found on the &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot;, and the &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; soundtracks, respectively.

Singer Phil Anselmo named &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; as his favorite Pantera album.

==Lyrics and style==
&quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; contains lyrics mostly about the band itself, as on &quot;We&#x27;ll Grind that Axe for a Long Time&quot; (where the band members tell about how they have kept it &quot;true&quot; throughout the years, while many of their peers &quot;sucked up for the fame&quot;) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Cast a Shadow&quot; (about Pantera&#x27;s influence on the genre). There are also songs about their fans, like &quot;Goddamn Electric&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Belong to It&quot;. &quot;Goddamn Electric&quot; mentions Black Sabbath and Slayer, two of Pantera&#x27;s main influences. The solo for &quot;Goddamn Electric&quot; was recorded by Kerry King in a bathroom after Slayer performed at Ozzfest in Dallas on July 13, 1999. The band members dedicated &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; to their fans who they viewed as their &quot;brothers and sisters&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover art is by Scott Caliva (1967–2003), a friend of Pantera lead singer Phil Anselmo. Caliva took the photo of a partygoer at Anselmo&#x27;s house jumping through a bonfire clutching a bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey. The bottle is pixelated on the cover so the label would not be visible, to avoid trademark infringement.

The 20th Anniversary Edition cover art was only made with the steel marking background, along with the logo and the album name similar to their 1990 album, &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;.

==Release==
===Commercial performance===
&quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number five on the Top Internet Albums, selling 161,105 copies in its first week of release according to Nielsen Soundscan. On its second week, it fell to number 24, selling only 59,962 copies, a 62.8% drop in sales. In total, the album only appeared on that chart for twelve weeks. On May 2, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting 500,000 units sold. However, it has yet to reach platinum status, making it Pantera&#x27;s only major-label studio album not to reach sales of 1,000,000. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 593,000 copies domestically as of October 2003. It also debuted at number eight on the Top Canadian Albums chart.

In a 2022 interview with &quot;Gibson TV&quot;, Rex Brown blamed the album&#x27;s lacklustre success compared to the band&#x27;s previous albums on the dominance of the nu metal genre at the time of its release.

=== Reception ===
The album was generally well received upon release, though reviews were less enthusiastic than on their previous albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a score of 3.5/5, and called it &quot;Metal-revivalist...relying on the genre&#x27;s primal elements of rage and analog noise...chopped up with squealing dissonance...brutal enough to please underground purists and familiar enough for weekend headbangers.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that it &quot;...resumes their scorched-earth policy with vigor...dropping aural anvils [along] with a dash of inventiveness...&quot;

&quot;Q&quot; magazine gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said it was &quot;Pantera&#x27;s attempt to upgrade [Judas Priest&#x27;s] &quot;British Steel&quot;-era pure metal spirit.&quot; &quot;Alternative Press&quot; echoed this sentiment, calling it &quot;An undiluted, unvarnished slab of riffs paying distinct homage to Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;British Steel&quot;, and not just in a titular sense, but in basic song construction.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, and stated &quot;&quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; is a nonstop assault on the senses, offering no respite from the intensity until the album has stopped playing. Yet somehow, it comes off as a cut below their best albums; perhaps it&#x27;s that the band&#x27;s sound lacks the sense of freshness that sparked &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;, and &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;.&quot;

===Accolades===
In the 2000 &quot;Metal Edge&quot; Readers&#x27; Choice Awards, the album was voted &quot;Album of the Year&quot; and &quot;Album Cover of the Year&quot; (tying with Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; for the latter), while the single &quot;Revolution Is My Name&quot; won &quot;Song of the Year&quot;.

&quot;Revolution Is My Name&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2001, but lost to Deftones&#x27; &quot;Elite&quot;.

The album was ranked at No. 2 on &quot;Guitar World&quot;&#x27;s Readers Poll for &quot;The Top 10 Guitar Albums of 2000&quot;.

A section of &quot;Death Rattle&quot; was rerecorded and renamed to “Pre-Hibernation” for the 2001 episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; called &quot;Pre-Hibernation Week&quot;. The song appears in the SpongeBob Original Theme Highlights album.

==Track listing==
All credits adapted from the original CD issue.

===20th Anniversary Edition===
Released in October 2020, &quot;The 20th Anniversary Edition of Reinventing the Steel&quot; includes re-mixes of the tracklist done by longtime Pantera producer Terry Date, as well as singles that were previously not released on any studio albums also remixed by Terry Date, radio edits of album tracks, and instrumental rough mixes of the album&#x27;s original tracks.

<text>The Ornithorhynchidae are one of the two extant families in the order Monotremata, and contain the platypus and its extinct relatives. The other family is the Tachyglossidae, or echidnas.

Within the Ornithorhynchidae are the main Cenozoic genera &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Obdurodon&quot;, and several potential stem-genera dating back to the Late Cretaceous, of which the oldest is possibly &quot;Dharragarra&quot;. Although fossil evidence suggests the presence of ornithorhynchids in the Cretaceous, phylogenetic evidence has largely found that they and the Tachyglossidae only diverged during the Cenozoic, although this varies based on the specific constraints used.

== Taxonomy ==
The following species are known:

*Family Ornithorhynchidae
**Genus &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot; (Pliocene to present)
***&quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot; (the modern platypus)
**Genus †&quot;Obdurodon&quot; (Oligocene to Miocene)
***†&quot;Obdurodon dicksoni&quot;
***†&quot;Obdurodon insignis&quot;
***†&quot;Obdurodon tharalkooschild&quot;
**Genus ?†&quot;Dharragarra&quot; (Late Cretaceous; Cenomanian)
***?†&quot;Dharragarra aurora&quot;
**Genus ?†&quot;Monotrematum&quot; (Early Paleocene) 
***?†&quot;Monotrematum sudamericanum&quot;
**Genus ?†&quot;Patagorhynchus&quot; (Late Cretaceous; Maastrichtian)
*** ?†&quot;Patagorhynchus pascuali&quot;
Although extant ornithorhynchids and most fossil genera are known from Australia, at least two potential genera (&quot;Monotrematum&quot; and &quot;Patagorhynchus&quot;) inhabited the southern tip of South America during the Maastrichtian and Paleocene, having presumably dispersed across Antarctica from Australia.

Another two genera, &quot;Steropodon&quot; and &quot;Teinolophos&quot;, were originally thought to belong to the Ornithorhynchidae. However, they were both placed into a new family, the Steropodontidae. This decision was made based on differences in the dentary recovered from the Griman Creek Formation, Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia. This dentary is the holotype for the genus &quot;Steropodon&quot;, thus the lack of information led to the original misclassification. Further research on &quot;Teinolophos&quot; has indeed shown it to be an animal much different from ornithochrynchids, lacking a beak, possessing a more complete mammalian dentition, and retaining primitive ears connected to the jaw as in more basal mammals. In 2022 it was proposed to move &quot;Teinolophos&quot; into its own family, Teinolophidae.

The extinct &quot;Ornithorhynchus maximus&quot; has been included in &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot;, but later placed with the echidna family Tachyglossidae as &quot;Zaglossus robustus&quot;.

=== Evolution ===
Most extinct ornithorhynchids, including the close platypus relative &quot;Obdurodon&quot;, appear to have had teeth in their jaws. This contrasts with the modern platypus, where adults are entirely toothless. It has been theorized that the loss of teeth in the platypus was a geologically recent event, occurring only in the Pleistocene (after over 95 million years of tooth presence in the ornithorhynchid lineage) after the migration of the rakali (&quot;Hydromys chrysogaster&quot;), a large semiaquatic rodent, to Australia. Competition between the rakali and platypus for hard-shelled prey may have led to trophic displacement of the platypus to instead rely on softer-bodied prey, losing its teeth in the process.

<text>Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys were an American rockabilly band from San Francisco, California.

==History==
Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys emerged from the San Francisco Bay Area music scene in the mid-1980s. Lead singer/guitarist Phillip Bury (b. 1954), under the stage name &quot;Buck Naked,&quot; performed wearing only cowboy boots, a cowboy hat, a guitar, and a strategically placed toilet plunger. Filling out the band were Buck&#x27;s brother Stephen Bury (performing as &quot;Hector Naked&quot;) and David Wees (as &quot;Stinky LePew&quot;). Despite its name, the rest of the band were more or less fully clothed on stage.

The band became friends with Primus. Sharing many aesthetic similarities, the latter would make numerous tributes to Bury, in their videos (&quot;Mr. Krinkle&quot; features a painting, &quot;Wynona&#x27;s Big Brown Beaver&quot; features a bass drum head), and in the album credits to 1993&#x27;s &quot;Pork Soda&quot;.

The band appeared on the &quot;Joan Rivers Show&quot; in 1991 for a segment on &quot;the most outrageous bands in the world.&quot;

The band came to an abrupt end in November 1992 when Phillip Bury was shot and killed while walking his dog in San Francisco&#x27;s Panhandle by a cab driver named Michael Kagan. Kagan had for many years fed pigeons there. He claimed Bury attacked him with a bicycle lock, and he shot Bury in self-defense. According to witnesses at the trial, Kagan had been known to threaten dogs who chased the pigeons, and, on occasion, their owners. Kagan appealed the case to California&#x27;s Supreme Court, but his conviction for manslaughter was upheld. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison, the maximum term allowed.

<text>Development hell, also known as development purgatory or development limbo, is media and software industry jargon for a project, concept, or idea that remains in a stage of early development for a long time because of legal, technical, or artistic challenges. A work may move between many sets of artistic leadership, crews, scripts, game engines, or studios. (The related terms production hell and production limbo refer to situations in which a film has begun production but has remained unfinished for a long time without progressing to post-production.)

Some projects enter development hell because they were initially designed with ambitious goals, the difficulty of meeting those goals was underestimated, and attempts to meet those goals have repeatedly failed.

The term is also applied more generally to describe any project that has unexpectedly stalled in the planning or design phase, has failed to meet its originally expected date of completion, and is languishing in those phases for what is seen as an unreasonably long time.

Many projects that enter development hell are gradually abandoned by the involved parties and are never produced.

== Overview ==
=== Film ===
Film industry companies buy the film rights to many popular novels, video games, and comic books, but often take years to bring those properties to the screen, having first made considerable changes to their plots, characters and general tone. When this pre-production process takes too long, a project will often be abandoned or cancelled outright. This happens quite often: Hollywood starts ten times as many projects as it releases. Less than two percent of all books that are optioned make it to the big screen. 

As David Hughes, author of the book &quot;Tales From Development Hell&quot;, has noted, one reason production is delayed is that, after producers, directors, and actors have been attached to a project, they may request script rewrites. Another cause of delay is that, after people have been attached to a project, they find they have conflicting interpretations of it or visions for it. For example, the director and the studio executives may have different opinions about a film&#x27;s casting, plot or budget. Development delays can also result when a lead actor or a key member of the production team withdraws from the project, or is taken ill, or dies; when there are labor strikes involving the writers, directors, crew or cast; when there are disputes about intellectual property rights or contract terms; when there is turnover at the studio&#x27;s executive level and the new leaders have a different vision; or when, due to changes in the wider economic, cultural or political climate, the film&#x27;s topic comes to be seen as no longer marketable.

Production hell refers to a situation in which a film has entered production but has remained in that phase for a long time without progressing to post-production.

=== Television ===
Television series can experience development hell between seasons, resulting in a long delay from one season to the next. Screenwriter Ken Aguado states that &quot;development hell rarely happens in series television&quot;, because writers for a television series &quot;typically only get a few cracks at executing a pilot, and if he or she doesn&#x27;t deliver, the project will be quickly abandoned.&quot;

=== Video games ===
Video game development can be stalled for years, occasionally over a decade, often due to a project being moved to different production studios, multiple iterations of the game being created and abandoned, or difficulties with the development of the game software itself, such as loss of funding, overambitious scope, and poor development time management. In the computer industry, vaporware is the term for a product, typically computer hardware or software, that is announced to the general public but is late or never actually manufactured nor officially cancelled.

=== Podcasts ===
A number of popular audio series are dedicated to discussing the topic of unmade creative projects, including &quot;Development Hell&quot;, a Dread Central podcast which uncovers notable cancelled horror films.

== Causes ==
The concept artist and illustrator Sylvain Despretz has suggested that, &quot;Development hell doesn&#x27;t happen with no-name directors. It happens only with famous directors that a studio doesn&#x27;t dare break up with. And that&#x27;s how you end up for two years just, you know, polishing a turd. Until, finally, somebody walks away, at great cost.&quot;

With video games, slow progress and a lack of funds may lead developers to focus their resources elsewhere. Occasionally, completed portions of a game fail to meet expectations, with developers subsequently choosing to abandon the project rather than start from scratch. The commercial failure of a released game may also result in any prospective sequels being delayed or cancelled.

== Turnaround deals ==
If a film is in development but never receives the necessary production funds, another studio may execute a turnaround deal and successfully produce the film. For example, Columbia Pictures stopped production of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). Universal Pictures then picked up the film and made it a success. When a studio completely abandons a film project, the costs are written off as part of the studio&#x27;s overhead, thereby reducing taxable income.

<doc id="310342" wikidata="Q835642" url="?curid=310342" title="TOPS">
<text>Total Operations Processing System (TOPS) is a computer system for managing railway locomotives and rolling stock, known for many years of use in the United Kingdom. 

TOPS was originally developed between the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), Stanford University and IBM as a replacement for paper-based systems for managing rail logistics. A jointly-owned consultancy company, &quot;TOPS On-Line Inc.&quot;, was established in 1960 with the goal of implementing TOPS, as well as selling it to third parties. Development was protracted, requiring around 660 man-years of effort to produce a releasable build. During mid-1968, the first phase of the system was introduced on the SP, and quickly proved its advantages over the traditional methods practiced prior to its availability.

In addition to SP, TOPS was widely adopted throughout North America and beyond. While it was at one point in widespread use across many of the United States railroads, the system has been perhaps most prominently used in the United Kingdom. During 1971, the country&#x27;s nationalised rail operation, British Rail (BR), opted to procure and integrate TOPS into its operations. The acquisition of an existing system rather than develop an indigenous programme was reasoned to be both cheaper and quicker to implement; it was noted, however, that TOPS was not capable of performing all desired functions. Since its implementation during the mid 1970s, both BR and its successors have continued to operate the system. SP itself has developed a newer system called the &quot;Terminal Information Processing System&quot; (TIPS), which replaced TOPS entirely during 1980.

==Early development==
During the 1950s and 1960s, it was increasingly recognised that the adoption of computer-based management systems could provide substantial benefits in various operations, particularly those involving logistics. Consequently, by the 1960s, various railways in various countries, including Japan, Canada, and the United States had begun to develop and introduce such systems. Amongst the organisations that adopted the technology early on was the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP).

During the late 1950s, SP entered into discussions with the American technology company IBM about implementing its technology for rail management purposes. IBM repurposed much of their work on the US Air Force&#x27;s SAGE project, designed to direct interceptor aircraft against approaching Soviet nuclear bombers, to instead serve the needs of the Southern Pacific. The project gained the name &quot;Total Operations Processing System&quot;, or &quot;TOPS&quot;, and its development was handled by a specially established consultancy company, &quot;TOPS On-Line Inc.&quot;, which was 80 percent owned by SP with the remaining stake held by IBM.

TOPS was to take all the paperwork associated with a locomotive or rolling stock - its maintenance history, its allocation to division and depot and duty, its status, its location, and much more - and keep it in computer form, constantly updated by terminals at every maintenance facility. On paper, this information was difficult to keep track of, awkward to keep up to date, and time-consuming to query, requiring many telephone calls. Computerizing this information enabled a railroad to keep better track of its assets, and thus to make better use of them.

TOPS was a relatively complex system for the era, being not only comprehensive but required to operate in real time. Accordingly, development was particularly time-consuming; according to BR Chief Operations Manager Robert Arnott, the first phase of TOPS involved around 660 man-years of effort, with eight years passing between the start of work and it being declared operational during mid-1968. Despite the lengthy development time, TOPS quickly proved to be a success for SP; clerks often observed that jobs which had taken half a day and dozens of telephone calls could instead be completed in under five minutes using TOPS.

The success of TOPS with SP soon led to a quick succession of sales of the system to a variety of other American railroads, along with international customers, where it typically proved to be similarly beneficial. Selling TOPS to other operators helped offset the systems&#x27; development costs, so SP was keen to sell TOPS to third parties. The company was also motivated to protect its reputation, and thus provided assistance to other railroads interested in TOPS, to improve its chances of success. Some operators, such as the Canadian National Railway, opted to introduce TOPS as an interim measure while its own bespoke system was developed as a long-term successor.

==Adoption by British Rail==
During the late 1960s, British Rail (BR) was looking for ways to increase efficiency, particularly of its declining freight operations, and identified a computer-based system as a key tool for improving both planning and control. The specific requirements included the more effective utilisation of freight rolling stock, better pre-planning of terminal and marshalling yard operations, better alignment of specific consignments to specific services, prompt response to customer location-related requests. BR planners realised early on that it would be quicker and cheaper to buy an existing system, rather than develop one locally, even if that breached the British Government&#x27;s requirement for nationalised industries to &#x27;Buy British&#x27;.

Various systems around the world were explored, such as France&#x27;s Gestion Centralisée du Trafic Marchandises (GCTM) and Canada&#x27;s Traffic Reporting and Control System (TRACS), but found this to be ill-suited to BR&#x27;s requirements; in fact, no existing system in the world satisfied them in full. However, SP&#x27;s TOPS system met many - but not all - of the outstanding requirements. Starting in June 1970, several delegations from SP came to the UK to discuss and evaluate BR&#x27;s existing practices, along with corresponding visits to the USA to witness SP&#x27;s operations, before both sides concluded that TOPS was a viable option.

Groundwork on TOPS&#x27; financial case had commenced in the summer of 1970, during which a four-year timescale for implementation had emerged as the preferred option. From an analysis performed in 1971, it was found that, even in the event of the most pessimistic assumptions being true, TOPS&#x27; introduction retained a healthy gain in net value of £34m per annum. Suitably convinced of its benefits, BR&#x27;s board opted to purchase the system, along with the source code (as was typical in those days for such a large mainframe-based system) during June 1971. Due to its foreign origins, the purchase of an IBM System/360 mainframe to operate TOPS had to be approved by the Heath cabinet, which was given in October 1971. The decision was justified by a belief that TOPS would enable BR&#x27;s freight operations to become profitable.

The cost of BR&#x27;s TOPS implementation included £5.6m of capital costs, development costs of £5.7m, and equipment rental costs of £22.5m between 1972 and 1980. Aside from the computers themselves, and suitably trained staff to operate them, perhaps the most technically challenging aspect impacting implementation was telecommunications, necessary to bring the system&#x27;s geographically disparate elements together. The implementation phase was greatly assisted by data processing experts provided by SP. It was at the urging of SP&#x27;s specialists that BR omitted the originally-sought volume acceptance feature, as it was considered to be impractical.

The operational headquarters for TOPS was established in an existing railway office block in close proximity to BR&#x27;s corporate headquarters. The building had to be extensively refitted for the scheme, the top floor being turned into an open-plan office for housing planning and development work, while the computing equipment and telecommunications gear was accommodated across two separate floors below; the latter requiring a controlled climate for reliable operation. According to Amott, the implementation of TOPS was undertaken without any significant adverse reaction in terms of industrial relations or senior management.

The adoption of the TOPS system during the early 1970s led to several changes in working practices across Britain&#x27;s railway network. Hitherto, locomotives had been numbered in three different series. Steam locomotives carried unadorned numbers up to five digits long. Diesel locomotives carried one to four-digit numbers prefixed with a letter &#x27;D&#x27;, and electric locomotives with a letter &#x27;E&#x27;. Thus, up to three locomotives could carry the same number. TOPS could not handle that, and it also required similar locomotives to be numbered in a consecutive series in terms of classification, so that they might be treated as a group.

===TOPS numbering under British Rail===

Sequentiality was all that was required but, given the need to renumber, it was decided to adopt a logical system for classification, and the five- or six-digit TOPS number was divided into two parts. No class of locomotive or multiple unit numbered over 1,000 examples, so the last three digits were used for the individual number between 001 and 999 in that class, although Class 43 goes down to 000, that being the number of the only remaining HST prototype power car. The first two or three digits were used to denote the class of locomotive or multiple unit. The numbers were often written in two space separated groups, such as &quot;47 401&quot; to highlight that division, but the TOPS system actually stored and displayed them without the space: &quot;47401&quot;. Sub-classifications were indicated in the TOPS system with a slash and a subclass number, e.g. &quot;47/4&quot;. It was convention, though not enforced within the TOPS system, that subclass numbers were boundaries in the locomotive numbering system, such that class &quot;47/4&quot; started with number &quot;47 401&quot;. If there were more than 99 numbers in a subclass, the number series extended to the next value of the third digit; thus, since there were more than 200 locomotives in class &quot;47/4&quot;, subclasses &quot;47/5&quot; and &quot;47/6&quot; did not exist, and the next valid subclass by convention was &quot;47/7&quot; starting with &quot;47 701&quot;. However, in some cases, the sequences do not match, e.g. 158/0 numbers start at 158 701.

Locomotives are assigned classes 01–98: diesel locomotives 01–79 (originally 01–69), AC electric locomotives 80–96, departmental locos (those not in revenue-earning use) 97, and steam locomotives 98. DC electric locomotives were originally allocated classes 70–79 but this was modified in 2011 (see British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification); the sole relic of this is Class 73 which continues unrenumbered, probably because it can be considered equally a diesel locomotive as it is a DC electric. One oddity was the inclusion of British Rail&#x27;s shipping fleet in the system as Class 99. Diesel multiple units (DMUs) with mechanical or hydraulic transmission are classified 100–199, with electric transmission 200–299. Electric multiple units (EMUs) are given the subsequent classes; 300–399 are overhead AC units (including AC/DC dual-voltage units), while Southern Region DC third rail EMUs are 400–499, other DC EMUs 500–599. More recently, new electric multiple units and bi-mode multiple units have been given the 700 series and new high-speed units have been given the 800 series. Selected numbers in the 900 series have been used for departmental multiple units, mostly converted from former passenger units. 

Coaching stock and individual multiple unit cars are allocated five-digit numbers; since the early 1980s, it has been forbidden for them to have the same numbers as locomotives, but before then duplication was possible because they carried a prefix letter, which was considered part of the number. More recent EMU deliveries have six-figure coach numbers.

==Recent history==
TOPS has become outdated in recent decades. It is a text-terminal, mainframe-driven system; which is regarded as not very user-friendly, and hard to use compared with contemporary computer user-interfaces. In addition, it is written in its own programming language, TOPSTRAN (not strictly speaking a separate language but a set of IBM Assembler macros), and it is increasingly hard to find and train developers to maintain it. The division of British Rail and privatisation has also hurt TOPS, because it was not designed for that purpose; some freight operating companies do not keep information as up to date as they should.

Attempts have been made to &#x27;skin&#x27; the system with a more user-friendly interface, called TOPS 2000; in addition, there are other parallel systems now, such as TRUST, Genius and the Mobile Consisting Application (since 2024 marketed as part of the Velociti Solutions RailSmart software suite), but none has yet fully supplanted the TOPS system.

==Sample output==
This is a typical report that a TOPS clerk could generate. The train in question is a 25 wagon freight train travelling from Over &amp; Wharton, near Winsford, to Reading West Junction, Berkshire.

<text>María Magdalena Nile del Río (26 December 1906 – 22 August 2003) was an Argentine professional singer and movie actress, better known as Imperio Argentina; she became a citizen of Spain in 1999.

María Magdalena Nile del Río was born to Antonio Nile (a guitar player, born in Gibraltar) and Rosario del Río (a native of Monda in the Province of Málaga). She performed onstage in her native Argentina, where she had a long and successful career. At that time, her stage name was &quot;Pettit Imperio&quot;. But her most successful moments came after she moved to Spain. It was there that she changed her name to &quot;Imperio Argentina&quot;, as a way to honor her &quot;other country&quot;. While in Spain, del Río acted in many movies, and frequently worked in television and radio. She obtained Spanish citizenship in 1999.
In 2001, she published her autobiography, &quot;Malena Clara&quot;, written by playwright Pedro Víllora

==Death==
In January 2003, she suffered an angina attack and was admitted to the University Hospital of Malaga. She died in Benalmádena in the Province of Málaga (her mother was born and raised in the same province) in August 2003, aged 97. She had two children. Her son, Florián Antonio Martínez Nile, by her marriage to Florián Rey, predeceased her, having committed suicide at age 24 in 1959. Her younger child was her daughter, Alejandra Goyanes Nile, by another marriage. She was married twice. As a divorcee, she could not, in Francoist Spain, legally marry Joaquín Goyanes, the father of her daughter.

<doc id="310344" wikidata="Q75853" url="?curid=310344" title="Jorge Rafael Videla">
<text>Jorge Rafael Videla ( ; ; 2 August 1925 – 17 May 2013) was an Argentine military officer and the &quot;de facto&quot; President of Argentina from 1976 to 1981, during the National Reorganization Process. His rule, which was during the time of Operation Condor, was among the most infamous in Latin America during the Cold War due to its high level of human rights abuses and severe economic mismanagement.

He came to power in a coup d&#x27;état that deposed Isabel Perón. In 1985, two years after the return of a representative democratic government, he was prosecuted in the Trial of the Juntas for large-scale human rights abuses and crimes against humanity under his rule including the widespread abduction, torture and murder of activists and political opponents along with their families at secret concentration camps. An estimated 13,000 to 30,000 political dissidents vanished during this period. Videla was also convicted of the theft of many babies born during the captivity of their mothers at the illegal detention centres and passing them on for illegal adoption by associates of the regime. Videla maintained the female guerrilla detainees allowed themselves to become pregnant in the belief they would not be tortured or executed. Videla remained under house arrest until 2008, when he was sent to a military prison.

On 2010, Videla took full responsibility for his army&#x27;s actions during his rule. Following a new trial, on 2010, Videla was sentenced to life in a civilian prison for the deaths of 31 prisoners following his &quot;coup&quot;. On 5 July 2012, Videla was sentenced to 50 years in civilian prison for the systematic kidnapping of children during his tenure. The following year, Videla died in the Marcos Paz civilian prison five days after suffering a fall in a shower.

==Early life and family==
Jorge Rafael Videla was born on 2 August 1925 in the city of Mercedes. He was the third of five sons born to Colonel Rafael Eugenio Videla Bengolea (1888–1951) and María Olga Redondo Ojea (1897–1987) and was christened in honor of his two older twin brothers, who had died of measles in 1923. Videla&#x27;s family was a prominent one in San Luis Province, and many of his ancestors had held high public offices. His grandfather Jacinto had been governor of San Luis between 1891 and 1893, and his great-great-grandfather Blas Videla had fought in the Spanish American wars of independence and had later been a leader of the Unitarian Party in San Luis.

On 7 April 1948, Videla married Alicia Raquel Hartridge (28 September 1927 – 5 November 2021) daughter of Samuel Alejandro Hartridge Parkes (1891–1969), an English Argentine professor of physics and Argentine ambassador to Turkey, and María Isabel Lacoste Álvarez (1893–1939). They had seven children: María Cristina (1949), Jorge Horacio (1950), Alejandro Eugenio (1951–1971), María Isabel (1954), Pedro Ignacio (1956), Fernando Gabriel (1961) and Rafael Patricio (1963). Two sons (Rafael Patricio and Fernando Gabriel) joined the Argentine Army.

==Army career==
Videla joined the National Military College (&quot;Colegio Militar de la Nación&quot;) on 1942 and graduated on 1944 with the rank of second lieutenant. After steady promotion as a junior officer in the infantry, he attended the War College between 1952 and 1954 and graduated as a qualified staff officer. Videla served at the Ministry of Defence from 1958 to 1960 and thereafter he directed the Military Academy until 1962. In 1971, he was promoted to brigade general and appointed by Alejandro Agustin Lanusse as Director of the National Military College. In late 1973 the head of the Army, Leandro Anaya, appointed Videla as the Chief of Staff of the Army. During July and , Videla was the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (&quot;Estado Mayor Conjunto&quot;) of the Argentine Armed Forces. In , the President, Isabel Perón, appointed Videla to the Army&#x27;s senior position, the General Commander of the Army.

==Coup d&#x27;état==
Upon the death of President Juan Perón, his widow and Vice President Isabel became president. Videla headed a military coup which deposed her on 1976, during increasing violence, social unrest and economic problems. A military junta was formed, made up of him, representing the Army; Admiral Emilio Massera representing the Navy; and Brigadier General Orlando Ramón Agosti representing the Air Force.

==Presidency==
Two days after the coup, Videla formally assumed the post of President of Argentina.

===Human rights violations===



The military junta is remembered for the forced disappearances of large numbers of students. The military junta took power during a period of terrorist attacks from the Marxist groups ERP, the Montoneros, FAL, FAR and FAP, who had gone underground after Juan Perón&#x27;s death in , and violent right-wing kidnappings, tortures and assassinations from the &quot;Argentine Anticommunist Alliance&quot;, led by José López Rega, Perón&#x27;s Minister of Social Welfare, and other death squads. The &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reported at the beginning of 1976 that, 
In the jungle-covered mountains of Tucuman, long known as &#x27;Argentina&#x27;s garden&#x27;, Argentines are fighting Argentines in a Vietnam-style civil war. So far, the outcome is in doubt. But there is no doubt about the seriousness of the combat, which involves 2,000 or so leftist guerrillas and perhaps as many as 10,000 soldiers. In late 1974 the ERP set up a rural front in Tucumán province and the Argentine Army deployed the 5th Mountain Brigade of the 2nd Army Division in counterinsurgency operations in the province. In early 1976 the mountain brigade was reinforced in the form of the 4th Airborne Brigade that had until then been withheld guarding strategic points in the city of Córdoba against ERP guerrillas and militants.

The members of the junta took advantage of the guerrilla threat to authorize the coup and naming the period in government as the &quot;National Reorganization Process&quot;. In all, 293 servicemen and policemen were killed in left-wing terrorist incidents in 1975 and 1976. Videla narrowly escaped three assassination attempts by the Montoneros and ERP between February 1976 and April 1977.

Justice Minister Ricardo Gil Lavedra, who formed part of the 1985 tribunal judging the military crimes committed during the Dirty War, later declared, &quot;I sincerely believe that the majority of the victims of the illegal repression were guerrilla militants&quot;. Some 10,000 of the disappeared were guerrillas of the Montoneros, and the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army. However, the campaign of repression actually intensified after the guerrillas were defeated and it was during this time, when they targeted the church, labor unions, artists, intellectuals and university students and professors, that the junta accumulated the greatest number of victims.

According to human right groups, an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 Argentines &quot;disappeared&quot; while in the custody of the police or the military. Among the victims were two French nuns (Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet) who had taught and cared for Videla&#x27;s disabled son, Alejandro. Some 1,500 to 4,000 were drugged into a stupor, loaded into military aircraft, stripped naked and then thrown into the Rio de la Plata and Atlantic Ocean to drown in what became known as &quot;death flights.&quot; Between 10,000 and 12,000 of the &quot;disappeared,&quot; PEN (Poder Ejecutivo Nacional) detainees held in clandestine detention camps throughout the dictatorship, were eventually released under diplomatic pressure. Terence Roehrig estimates that of the disappeared &quot;at least 10,000 were involved in various ways with the guerrillas&quot;.

In the book &quot;Disposición Final&quot; by Argentine journalist Ceferino Reato, Videla confirms for the first time that between 1976 and 1983, 8,000 Argentines have been murdered by his regime. The bodies were hidden or destroyed to prevent protests at home and abroad. Videla also maintained that female guerrilla detainees allowed themselves to become pregnant in the belief they would not be tortured or executed, but they were. The children whom they bore in prison were taken from them, illegally adopted by military families of the regime, and their identities were hidden for decades.

According to human rights organisations in Argentina, between 1,900 and 3,000 Jews were among the 30,000 who were targeted by the Argentine military junta. It is a disproportionate number, as Jews comprised between 5–12% of those targeted but only 1% of the population. Historian Daniel Muchnik attributed this to many Jews gravitating to political activism and armed resistance groups such as the ERP and FAP during the period. However, testimonies from Jewish Argentines suggest that they were targeted for being Jewish. Many torture victims were said to have seen pictures of Adolf Hitler and swastikas on walls of torture chambers and interrogators uttering anti-Semitic epithets. Jews were also known to have suffered anti-Semitic harassment while in the Argentine military. Between 200 and 300 Jews were subject to attacks, often by their superiors.

Some 11,000 Argentines have applied for and received up to US$200,000 as monetary compensation from the state for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship. The &quot;Asamblea por los Derechos Humanos&quot; (APDH or Assembly for Human Rights) believes that 12,261 people were killed or disappeared during the &quot;National Reorganization Process&quot;. Politically, all legislative power was concentrated in the hands of Videla&#x27;s nine-man junta, and every important position in the national government was filled with loyal military officers.

===Economic policy===

As Argentina&#x27;s new president, Videla faced a collapsing economy racked by soaring inflation. He largely left economic policies in the hands of Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, who adopted a free trade and deregulatory economic policy.

Martínez de Hoz took measures to restore economic growth, reversing Peronism in favour of a free market economy. Inflation rate decreased somewhat, but remained still high.

He enjoyed the personal friendship of David Rockefeller, who facilitated Chase Manhattan Bank and International Monetary Fund loans of nearly US$1 billion after his arrival.

He eliminated all price controls and the exchange controls regime. The black market and shortages disappeared.

He freed exports (removed existing prohibitions and quotas and export taxes were repealed) and imports (removed existing prohibitions, quotas, and licenses and gradually reduced import tariffs).

During his tenure, the foreign debt increased fourfold, and disparities between the upper and lower classes became much more pronounced. The period ended in a tenfold devaluation and one of the worst financial crises in Argentine history.

===Foreign relations===

The coup d&#x27;état had been planned since October 1975, and the United States Department of State learned of the preparations two months before its execution. Henry Kissinger would meet several times with Argentine Armed Forces leaders after the coup, urging them to destroy their opponents quickly before outcry over human rights abuses grew in the United States.

The US State Department saw Argentina as a bulwark of anti-communism in South America and in early April 1976, the US Congress approved a request by the Ford Administration, written by Henry Kissinger, to grant $50,000,000 in security assistance to the junta. In 1977, the US Department of Defense authorized $700,000 to train 217 Argentine military officers and in 1977 and 1978 the United States sold more than $120,000,000 in spare military parts to Argentina.

At the same time, though, the new US President Jimmy Carter highlighted issues of human rights and, in 1978, convinced Congress to cut off all US arms transfers to Argentina.

During Videla&#x27;s regime, Argentina rejected the binding Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration over the Beagle conflict (about possession of the Picton, Lennox and Nueva islands) at the southern tip of South America and started Operation Soberanía in order to invade the islands. In 1978, however, Pope John Paul II opened a mediation process. His representative, Antonio Samorè, successfully prevented full-scale war.

The conflict was not completely resolved until after Videla&#x27;s time as president. Once democratic rule was restored in 1983, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina (&quot;Tratado de Paz y Amistad&quot;), which acknowledged Chilean sovereignty over the islands, was signed and ratified by popular referendum.

Although Videla was anti-Communist, his regime maintained good relations with the Soviet Union and China; trade ties with both were expanded under his rule.

===Public relations===
One of Videla&#x27;s greatest challenges was his image abroad. He attributed criticism over human rights to an anti-Argentine campaign. On 19 May 1976, he attended a luncheon with a group of Argentine intellectuals, including Ernesto Sábato, Jorge Luis Borges, Horacio Esteban Ratti (president of the Argentine Writers Society) and Father Leonardo Castellani. The latter expressed to Videla his concern regarding the disappearance of another writer, Haroldo Conti.
On 30 April 1977, Azucena Villaflor, along with 13 other women, started demonstrations on the Plaza de Mayo, in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace, demanding to be told the whereabouts of their disappeared children. They became known as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (&quot;Madres de Plaza de Mayo&quot;).

During a human rights investigation in , the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights denounced Videla&#x27;s government, citing many disappearances and instances of abuse. In response, the junta hired the Burson-Marsteller ad agency to formulate a pithy comeback: &quot;Los argentinos somos derechos y humanos&quot; (Literally, &quot;We the Argentines are righteous and humane&quot;). The slogan was printed on 250,000 bumper stickers and distributed to motorists throughout Buenos Aires to create the appearance of a spontaneous support of pro-junta sentiment, at a cost of approximately $16,117.

Videla used the 1978 FIFA World Cup for political purposes. He cited the enthusiasm of the Argentine fans for their victorious football team as evidence of his personal and the junta&#x27;s popularity.

In 1980, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, leader of the Peace and Justice Service, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for reporting many of Argentina&#x27;s human rights violations to the world at large.

==Later life and death==

Videla relinquished power to Roberto Viola on 1981. On April 7, 1982, Videla attended the swearing-in ceremony of general Mario Benjamín Menéndez as governor of the Malvinas Islands. The military regime continued until it collapsed after losing the Falklands war in 1982. Democracy was restored in 1983.

The new government began prosecution of top-ranking officers for crimes committed during the dictatorship in what was called the Trial of the Juntas of 1985. Videla was convicted of numerous homicides, kidnapping, torture, and many other crimes. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and was discharged from the military in 1985.

Videla was imprisoned for five years. In 1990, President Carlos Menem pardoned Videla and many other imprisoned former members of the military regime. Menem also pardoned the leftist guerrilla commanders accused of terrorism. In a televised address to the nation, President Menem said, &quot;I have signed the decrees so we may begin to rebuild the country in peace, in liberty and in justice ... We come from long and cruel confrontations. There was a wound to heal.&quot;

Videla briefly returned to prison in 1998 when a judge found him guilty of the kidnapping of babies during the Dirty War, including the child of the &quot;desaparecida&quot; Silvia Quintela, and the disappearances of the commanders of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ERP), Mario Roberto Santucho and Benito Urteaga. Videla spent 38 days in the old part of the Caseros Prison. Due to health issues, he was later transferred to house arrest.

Following the election of President Néstor Kirchner in 2003, there was a renewed widespread effort in Argentina to show the illegality of Videla&#x27;s rule. The government no longer recognized Videla as having been a legal president of the country, and his portrait was removed from the military school. In 2003, Congress repealed the Ley de Punto Final, which had ended prosecutions for crimes under the dictatorship. In 2005, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled that the law had been unconstitutional. The government re-opened prosecution of crimes against humanity.

On 6 September 2006, Judge Norberto Oyarbide ruled that the pardons granted by President Menem were unconstitutional. On 2007, a federal court struck down Videla&#x27;s presidential pardon and restored his convictions for human rights abuses.

He was put on trial on 2010 for new charges of human rights violations relating to the deaths of 31 prisoners who died under his rule. Three days later, Videla took full responsibility for his army&#x27;s actions during his rule, saying, &quot;I accept the responsibility as the highest military authority during the internal war. My subordinates followed my orders.&quot; On 2010, the trial ended, and Videla was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He was ordered to be transferred to a civilian prison immediately after the trial. In handing down the sentence, judge María Elba Martínez said that Videla was &quot;a manifestation of state terrorism.&quot; During the trial, Videla had said that &quot;yesterday&#x27;s enemies are in power and from there, they are trying to establish a Marxist regime&quot; in Argentina.

On 5 July 2012, Videla was convicted and sentenced to 50 years&#x27; imprisonment for his participation in a scheme to steal babies from parents detained by the military regime. According to the court decision, Videla was an accomplice &quot;in the crimes of theft, retention and hiding of minors, as well as replacing their identities.&quot; The children were given to military families for illegal adoption, and their identities were hidden. An estimated 400 children were stolen during this period, often from mothers who gave birth in prison and who were later &quot;disappeared.&quot; By June 2019, 130 of these adoptees had their identities restored.

On 17 May 2013, Videla was reported as having died of natural causes in his sleep while serving his sentence at a Marcos Paz prison. An autopsy revealed he died from multiple fractures and internal hemorrhaging caused by having slipped in a prison shower on 12 May. According to a 2009 ruling by the military, he (and others convicted of human rights violations) were not eligible for a military funeral. A private ceremony was held by his family.

Human rights organizations throughout the political compass denounced Videla, saying that he died without admitting that he was aware of the disappeared persons and kidnapped children. None of the tried ex-officers has provided details about the fate of those missing. Videla appeared mostly unrepentant for the actions against those whom he deemed terrorist subversives.

Several Argentine politicians commented on his death. Deputy Ricardo Gil Lavedra of the Radical Civic Union said that Videla will be remembered as a dictator, while Hermes Binner expressed condolences to the victims of his government. Hernán Lombardi, Minister of Culture of Buenos Aires city, praised Argentine democracy for having tried and sentenced the dictator. Ricardo Alfonsín said it was good that Videla had died in prison. Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, Argentine recipient of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize, said, &quot;The death of Videla should not delight anybody, we have to keep working for a better society, more just, more humane, so that all that horror never happens again&quot;.

Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said that he was glad that, &quot;Videla died prosecuted, sentenced and imprisoned in a common cell, repudiated by the Argentine people&quot;. At the time of Videla&#x27;s death he was one of two surviving dictators of Argentina. The last surviving president from the dictatorship, Reynaldo Bignone, died on 7 March 2018.

Videla remained a Roman Catholic until the end of his life.

<doc id="310352" wikidata="Q3106776" url="?curid=310352" title="William Morgan (anti-Mason)">
<text>William Morgan (born 1774 – disappeared 1826) was a resident of Batavia, New York, whose disappearance and presumed murder in 1826 ignited a powerful movement against the Freemasons, a fraternal society that had become influential in the United States. After Morgan announced his intention to publish a book exposing Freemasonry&#x27;s secrets, he was arrested on trumped-up charges. He disappeared soon after and was believed to have been kidnapped and killed by Masons from western New York.

The allegations surrounding Morgan&#x27;s disappearance and presumed death sparked a public outcry and inspired Thurlow Weed and others to harness the discontent by founding the new Anti-Masonic Party in opposition to President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Democrats. It ran a presidential candidate in 1832 but was nearly defunct by 1835.

== Early life and education ==
Morgan was born in Culpeper, Virginia, in 1774. His birth date is sometimes given as August 7, but no definite source for this is cited. He worked as a bricklayer and stone cutter and later used his savings to open a store in Richmond.

==Military service==
Morgan told friends and acquaintances that he had served with distinction as a captain during the War of 1812, and his associates in upstate New York appear to have accepted this claim. Several men named William Morgan appear in the Virginia militia rolls for this period, but none held the rank of captain, and whether Morgan actually served in the war has not been determined with certainty.

==Marriage and family==
In October 1819, when he was in his mid-40s, Morgan married 19-year-old Lucinda Pendleton in Richmond, Virginia. They had two children: Lucinda Wesley Morgan and Thomas Jefferson Morgan. Two years after his marriage, Morgan moved his family to York, Upper Canada, where he operated a brewery. When his business was destroyed in a fire, Morgan was reduced to poverty.

He returned with his family to the United States, settling first at Rochester, New York, and later in Batavia, where he again worked as a bricklayer and stonecutter. Nineteenth-century local histories described Morgan as a heavy drinker and a gambler, characterizations disputed by Morgan&#x27;s friends and supporters.

== Book on Freemasonry ==
Morgan claimed to have been made a Master Mason while he was living in Canada, and he appears to have briefly attended a lodge in Rochester. In 1825, Morgan received the Royal Arch degree at Le Roy&#x27;s Western Star Chapter Number 33, having declared under oath that he had previously received the six degrees that preceded it. It has never been established if he actually received these degrees and, if so, from which lodge. Morgan then attempted unsuccessfully to help establish or visit lodges and chapters in Batavia, but he was denied participation by members who disapproved of his character and even questioned his claims to Masonic membership. Morgan finally announced that he was going to publish an exposé titled &quot;Illustrations of Masonry&quot;, critical of the Freemasons and revealing their secret degree ceremonies in detail.

Morgan declared that a local newspaper publisher, David Cade Miller, had given him a sizable advance for the work. Miller is said to have received the entered apprentice degree (the first degree of Freemasonry), but had been stopped from advancement by the objection of Batavia lodge members. Morgan was promised one-fourth of the profits, and the financial backers of the venture—Miller, John Davids (Morgan&#x27;s landlord), and Russel Dyer—entered into a $500,000 penal bond with Morgan to guarantee its publication.

== Disappearance ==
Since Masons place their hands on a Bible and promise not to reveal the passwords and grips of the degrees, several members of the Batavia lodge published an advertisement denouncing Morgan for breaking his word by authoring the book. An attempt was also made to set fire to Miller&#x27;s newspaper office and print shop. On September 11, 1826, Morgan was arrested for supposed nonpayment of a loan and allegedly stealing a shirt and a tie; according to the laws of the time he could be held in debtors&#x27; prison until restitution was made, which would have made it more difficult to publish his book. Morgan was jailed in Canandaigua, and when Miller learned of this, he went to the jail to pay the debt and secure Morgan&#x27;s release. Morgan was released, but then re-arrested and charged with supposedly failing to pay a two dollar tavern bill. While the jailer was away, a group of men convinced his wife to release Morgan; they walked to a waiting carriage, which arrived two days later at Fort Niagara. Shortly afterwards, Morgan disappeared.

There are conflicting accounts of what happened next. The generally accepted version of events is that Morgan was taken in a boat to the middle of the Niagara River and thrown overboard, where he presumably drowned, since he was never seen again in the community. In 1848, Henry L. Valance allegedly confessed on his deathbed to taking part in Morgan&#x27;s murder, a purported event recounted in chapter two of Reverend C. G. Finney&#x27;s anti-Masonic book &quot;The Character, Claims, and Practical Workings of Freemasonry&quot; (1869).

In October 1827, a badly decomposed body washed up on the shores of Lake Ontario. Many presumed it to be Morgan, and the body was buried as his. However, the wife of a missing Canadian named Timothy Monroe (or Munro) positively identified the clothing on the body as that which had been worn by her husband at the time he had disappeared. One group of Freemasons denied that Morgan was killed, alleging that they had paid him $500 to leave the country. Morgan was reportedly seen later, including in other countries, but none of the reports were confirmed. Eventually, Eli Bruce, the sheriff of Niagara County and a Mason, was removed from office and tried for his involvement in Morgan&#x27;s disappearance; he served 28 months in prison after being convicted of conspiracy for his role in kidnapping Morgan and holding him against his will before his disappearance. Three other Masons, Loton Lawson, Nicholas Chesebro, and Edward Sawyer, were convicted of taking part in the kidnapping and served sentences. Other Batavia Masons were tried and acquitted. Author Jasper Ridley suggests that Morgan was probably killed by local Masons, as all other scenarios are highly improbable. Historian H. Paul Jeffers also considers this the more credible explanation. C. T. Congdon, in &quot;Reminiscences of a Journalist&quot;, cites a third-hand account &quot;that Morgan was murdered by certain very zealous Freemasons,&quot; and notes that the resultant anti-Mason sentiment caused many elections to go to non-Masons for a number of years afterwards.

== Aftermath: the anti-Masonic movement ==
Soon after Morgan disappeared, Miller published Morgan&#x27;s book, which became a bestseller because of the notoriety of the events surrounding his disappearance. Miller did not say that Morgan had been murdered but that he had been &quot;carried away&quot;. Unverified rumors speculated that Morgan had assumed a new identity and settled in Albany, Canada, or the Cayman Islands, where he was supposed to have been hanged as a pirate. New York governor DeWitt Clinton, also a Mason, offered a $1,000 reward (over $27,000 in 2023) for information about Morgan&#x27;s whereabouts, but it was never claimed.

The circumstances of Morgan&#x27;s disappearance and the minimal punishment received by his kidnappers caused public outrage, and he became a symbol of the rights of free speech and free press. Protests against Freemasons took place in New York and the neighboring states; Masonic officials disavowed the actions of the kidnappers, but all Masons were under a cloud of suspicion. Thurlow Weed, a New York politician, gathered discontented opponents of President Andrew Jackson, a Mason, into the Anti-Masonic Party, which gained the support of such notable politicians as William H. Seward and Millard Fillmore.

In the 1828 campaign, other Jackson rivals, including John Quincy Adams, joined in denouncing the Masons. In 1832, the Anti-Masonic Party fielded William Wirt as its presidential candidate and Amos Ellmaker as his running mate, and they received Vermont&#x27;s seven electoral votes. By 1835, the party had become moribund everywhere but Pennsylvania, as other issues, such as slavery, became the focus of national attention. In 1847, Adams published a widely distributed book titled &quot;Letters on the Masonic Institution&quot; that criticized the Masons&#x27; secret society.

Members of Freemasonry criticized the Mormons for their adoption of Masonic rituals and regalia. In 1830, Morgan&#x27;s widow, Lucinda Pendleton Morgan, married George W. Harris of Batavia, a silversmith who was 20 years older. After they moved to the Midwest, they became Mormons. By 1837, some historians believe that Lucinda Pendleton Morgan Harris had become one of the plural wives of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. She continued to live with George Harris. After Smith was murdered in 1844, she was &quot;sealed&quot; to him for eternity in a rite of the church. By 1850, the Harrises had separated. When George Harris died in 1860, he had been excommunicated from the Mormons after ceasing to practice with them. That year, Lucinda Morgan Harris was reported to have joined the Catholic Sisters of Charity in Memphis, Tennessee, where she worked at the Leah Asylum. She had been widowed three times. In 1841, the Mormons announced their vicarious baptism of William Morgan after his death, as one of the first under their new rite to posthumously offer people entrance into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

In June, 1881, a grave was discovered in a quarry two miles south of the Indian reservation in Pembroke, New York. In it were bones and a metal tobacco box. Other items found included a ring with the inscribed initials &quot;W. M.&quot; The box contained a crumpled paper; its few legible words seemed to suggest that the remains might have been Morgan&#x27;s. There were also critics who suggested that the alleged discovery of the bones and other artifacts was intentionally timed to coincide with the effort to construct a memorial to Morgan and might have been an effort to generate publicity for the monument, which was in fact dedicated in 1882.

== Monument to Morgan ==

On September 13, 1882, the National Christian Association, a group opposed to secret societies, commissioned and erected a statue in &quot;memoriam&quot; to Morgan in the Batavia Cemetery, in Batavia, New York, where Timothy Monroe&#x27;s body had been buried. The ceremony was witnessed by 1,000 people, including representatives from local Masonic lodges.

The monument reads:
Sacred to the memory of Wm. Morgan, a native of Virginia, a Capt. in the War of 1812, a respectable citizen of Batavia, and a martyr to the freedom of writing, printing and speaking the truth. He was abducted from near this spot in the year 1826, by Freemasons and murdered for revealing the secrets of their order. The court records of Genesee County and the files of the &quot;Batavia Advocate&quot;, kept in the Recorders office contain the history of the events that caused the erection of this monument.

== Representation in other media ==
The pharmacist John Uri Lloyd based part of the background story of his popular scientific allegorical novel &quot;Etidorhpa&quot; (1895) on the kidnapping of William Morgan and the start of the Anti-Masonry movement.

In his novel &quot;The Craft: Freemasons, Secret Agents, and William Morgan&quot; (2010), the author Thomas Talbot presents a fictional version of the William Morgan kidnapping. He portrays him as a British spy, includes rogue British Masons, and has presidential agents thwart an assassination plot.

He is also featured in Timothy Liu&#x27;s poem &quot;Secret Combinations&quot; from his 2005 book of poems, &quot;For Dust Thou Art&quot;.

<doc id="310355" wikidata="Q1402016" url="?curid=310355" title="Magic in Harry Potter">
<text>In the fictional universe of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, magic is depicted as a supernatural force that overrides the laws of nature. In humans, magical ability is inborn and is usually inherited. Most children of magical parents are magical themselves. Some children of &quot;Muggle&quot; (non-magical) parents also display magical ability. Children who are born to wizard parents but are unable to perform magic are known as Squibs.

J. K. Rowling, the creator of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, based many magical elements in her fictional universe on real-world mythology and folklore. She has described this derivation as &quot;a way of giving texture to the world&quot;. The magic of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; was the subject of a 2017 British Library exhibition and an accompanying documentary. The exhibition, entitled &quot;Harry Potter: A History of Magic&quot;, was the first at the British Library to be based on a single series by a living author.

==Using magic==
Wizards must learn how to control their magic. In young and untrained children, magical effects will occur spontaneously during moments of strong emotion. For example, Harry Potter liberates a boa constrictor at the London Zoo and inflates his Aunt Marge to an enormous size. Although young children usually cannot control their magic, the young Voldemort could intentionally cause magical things to happen to other people. In the novels, almost all intentional magic is performed with a wand.

Spells are the every-purpose tools of a wizard. They are generally short bursts of magic used to accomplish a specialised task, such as creating fire or unlocking a door. Casting a spell usually requires the movement of a wand and the uttering of an incantation. The language of the incantations in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels has been described as modified Latin. Although wizards in the novels almost always use a wand for casting spells, Rowling has used the &quot;Wizarding World&quot; website to describe certain wizarding cultures that practise magic without a wand. While most spells depicted in the books require the caster to use their voice, some do not. For example, Albus Dumbledore has been known to do impressive feats of magic without speaking. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Harry performs &quot;lumos&quot; to light his wand when he is not holding it.

== The limits of magic ==
Before publishing the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novel, Rowling spent five years establishing the limitations of magic – determining what it can and cannot do. &quot;The most important thing to decide when you&#x27;re creating a fantasy world,&quot; she said in 2000, &quot;is what the characters &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; do.&quot; In the novels, the character Hermione Granger explains that food cannot be conjured out of thin air. Wizards can prepare it using magic and even multiply it, but they cannot create it. According to Rowling, money also cannot be conjured from nothing.

===Death===
In &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, Albus Dumbledore tells Harry that magic cannot truly and permanently bring dead individuals back to life. However, there are methods of communicating with the dead in a limited way. For example, all Hogwarts headmasters appear in a magical portrait when they die, which allows future generations to consult with them. However, the portrait is a reflection of who the wizard was, and is not a link to their spirit. The Resurrection Stone allows the bearer to speak with the dead, but it cannot bring the dead back into the living world.

Likewise, it is not possible to make oneself immortal unless one uses an object of great power to sustain life, such as the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone or a Horcrux. If one were to possess the three Deathly Hallows, it is fabled that they would possess the tools to become the &quot;master of death&quot;. Other methods of extending life include drinking unicorn blood, which will keep a person alive even if death is imminent, but at the price of being cursed forever. Being magical can contribute to one&#x27;s longevity, as there are several characters in the series who are unusually long-lived. It is revealed by Nearly Headless Nick in the fifth novel that all wizards have the choice of becoming ghosts upon dying; however, it is described as &quot;a pale imitation of life&quot;. Rowling has stated that death is the most important theme in the novels.

===Emotion===
As explained earlier, young untrained wizards can trigger uncontrolled magic when they are in a state of intense emotion. But emotions also affect trained witches and wizards and their magical abilities. For instance, in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;, a heartbroken Nymphadora Tonks temporarily loses her power as a Metamorphmagus when Remus Lupin starts distancing himself from her; the form of her Patronus changes to reflect her depression. Another example is Merope Gaunt, who only demonstrated any magical ability when removed from her father&#x27;s oppression, but then lost it again when her husband abandoned her.

Several magical spells require the use of certain emotions when casting them. The Patronus charm, for example, requires the caster to concentrate on a happy memory.

Love is depicted as a particularly powerful form of magic. Lily Potter&#x27;s voluntary sacrifice on Harry&#x27;s behalf grants him a magical protection that saves him from Voldemort as a baby, and Harry makes a similar sacrifice to save his friends at the end of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. A certain key prophecy in the series describes Harry as having &quot;power the Dark Lord knows not&quot;, referencing his capacity for love.

True love is impossible to create magically, although love potions can create intense infatuation.

==Magical abilities==
=== Animagus ===
An animagus is a wizard who can turn into a particular animal at will. This ability is acquired by magical means. By law, all British animagi must register with the Ministry of Magic. During the course of the series, several unregistered animagi are depicted, including James Potter, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and Rita Skeeter. Minerva McGonagall is a registered animagus who takes the form of a domestic cat. A wizard&#x27;s animagus form is determined by their personality.

===Apparition===
Apparition is a magical form of teleportation, by which a wizard can disappear (&quot;disapparate&quot;) from one location and reappear (&quot;apparate&quot;) in another. According to Harry, Apparition feels like being squeezed through a tight rubber tube, and Dumbledore explains to him that most students vomit their first time apparating. A wizard must be at least 17 years old to apparate, and students at Hogwarts may take Apparition lessons during their sixth year, akin to Muggles taking driving lessons around the same age. Wizards without an Apparition license can use &quot;side-along apparition&quot; to travel with someone who does.

Learning to apparate is difficult, and students run the risk of &quot;splinching&quot;—being physically split between the origin and destination. Splinching is quite common during lessons and can be uncomfortable or very painful, but is ultimately harmless if properly reversed. To remedy a splinch requires the assistance of the Ministry&#x27;s Accidental Magic Reversal Squad or essence of dittany.

Apparition is considered unreliable over long distances, and even experienced practitioners sometimes prefer other means of transport. Rowling has stated that cross-continental apparition &quot;would almost certainly result in severe injury or death.&quot; For reasons of security, Hogwarts is protected by anti-apparition spells, which prevent most humans from apparating on the school grounds. However, Dumbledore can apparate in and out of Hogwarts at his discretion, because as he tells Harry, being Headmaster &quot;has its privileges.&quot;

Magical devices such as the Floo Network, Portkeys and Vanishing Cabinets also provide forms of teleportation.

=== Gubraithian fire ===
Gubraithian Fire is an everlasting magical fire that can only be created by extremely skilled wizards. Hagrid and Madame Maxime gave a bundle of Gubraithian fire, conjured by Dumbledore, to the leader of the giants. The gift was part of an attempt to sway the giants to Dumbledore&#x27;s side in the struggle against Voldemort.

===Legilimency and Occlumency===
Legilimency is the practice of extracting feelings and memories from another person&#x27;s mind – a form of magical telepathy. It also allows the practitioner to convey visions or memories to another person. A wizard possessing this skill is called a Legilimens, and can, for example, detect deceit in another person, witness their memories, or plant visions in their mind. The counter-skill to Legilimency is Occlumency, which is practised by an Occlumens. It can be used to prevent a Legilimens from discovering the practitioner&#x27;s thoughts or memories. Voldemort, Severus Snape, Albus Dumbledore, and Gellert Grindelwald are all skilled in Legilimency and Occlumency.

===Metamorphmagus===
A metamorphmagus is a wizard who can change their appearance at will. Nymphadora Tonks and her son, Teddy Lupin, are the only living metamorphmagi mentioned in the novels. At various points, Tonks changes her hair colour and style according to her mood. She is a relatively young woman, but she occasionally chooses to appear elderly.

===Parselmouth===
Parseltongue is the language of snakes. Those who can speak parseltongue are called parselmouths. The ability is rare, and the only parselmouths mentioned in the novels are Harry Potter, Salazar Slytherin, and Slytherin&#x27;s descendants (which includes Voldemort). Rowling said she derived the term &quot;parselmouth&quot; from &quot;an old word for someone who has a problem with the mouth, like a hare lip&quot;.

===Seer===
A seer is a wizard with the clairvoyant ability to foresee future events. The predictions given through this ability can sometimes be self-fulfilling prophecies, and Dumbledore states in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; that not all of them come true, depending on the choices made by those involved. According to Minerva McGonagall, true seers are extremely rare. Sybill Trelawney is the only seer portrayed in the novel. She has twice made true prophecies – both significant to Harry Potter – but had no recollection of either prediction afterward. Another notable seer is Gellert Grindelwald, an infamous dark wizard, who acquired the ability of precognition from an enchantment incorporating the sacrifice of a qilin.

==Spell-like effects==

===Unbreakable vow===
The unbreakable vow is a voluntary agreement made between two wizards. It must be performed with the assistance of a witness, known as a &quot;bonder&quot;. The vow is not literally unbreakable, but breaking it will cause death.

===Priori incantatem===
Priori incantatem is a spell-like effect used to reveal the spells cast by a wand. The spells emerge from the wand as ghost-like replicas in reverse order, with the latest spell cast emerging first. Forcing two wands that share the source of their cores to battle can unintentionally cause a potent form of priori incantatem. The loser&#x27;s wand will regurgitate shadows of spells that it has cast, in reverse chronological order. This side effect occurs during the duel between Harry and Voldemort at the end of &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. Their simultaneous, contrary spells trigger the threads, and as Voldemort loses the battle of wills, his wand regurgitates, in reverse order, echoes of the people his wand had most recently murdered.

==Dark Arts==
The Dark Arts are magical spells and practices that are usually used for malicious purposes. Practitioners of the Dark Arts are referred to as Dark wizards. The most prominent Dark wizard is Voldemort (having previously been Grindelwald until his defeat to Dumbledore in 1945), who has followers called Death Eaters. The type of spells characteristic of Dark Arts are known as &quot;curses&quot;, which usually cause harm to the target.

Use of Dark Magic can corrupt the soul and body; Voldemort has used such magic in his quest to prolong his life and obtain great power. The Dark Arts also cause Voldemort to look deformed and inhuman, a side effect of splitting his soul into Horcruxes.

In the wizarding world, use of the Dark Arts is strongly stigmatised, and certain spells are illegal. Hogwarts and other schools instruct students in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Some schools, such as Durmstrang, teach Dark magic. While Hogwarts is under Death Eater control, a Dark Arts class is taught.

===Unforgivable Curses===
The Unforgivable Curses are the three worst known spells of the Dark Arts. Their use is punishable by a life sentence in Azkaban prison.

* The Killing Curse causes immediate death. It has no cure and cannot be blocked by most magical means. Harry Potter is the only person known to have survived this curse. The incantation for this curse is &quot;avada kedavra&quot;.
* The Cruciatus Curse causes the victim intense pain and is used for torture. The strength of the curse is determined by the motivations of who casts the curse. For example, a sadistic desire to inflict pain will produce a more effective curse than righteous anger. The curse has been used to torture victims to the point of death or insanity. The incantation for the Cruciatus Curse is &quot;crucio&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;I torture&quot;.
* The Imperius Curse is used for mind control or hypnosis. It can force the victim to do things they normally would be unwilling or unable to do. The incantation for the Imperius Curse is &quot;imperio&quot;.

=== Dark Mark ===
The Dark Mark is the symbol of Voldemort and the Death Eaters. It appears as a skull with a snake for a tongue, and it is cast into the sky whenever Death Eaters commit a murder. Every Death Eater has the Dark Mark branded on their left forearm. This brand allows the Death Eaters and Voldemort to summon each other.

===Inferius===
An inferius (plural: inferi) is a corpse that is animated and manipulated by a Dark wizard. An inferius is not alive, but has been bewitched to perform a specific duty. An inferius carries out its assigned task mindlessly and cannot think for itself. In the novels, the Ministry of Magic fears that Voldemort is killing enough people to make an army of &quot;inferi&quot;.

Inferi appear in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, in the cave where one of Voldemort&#x27;s Horcruxes (the locket of Salazar Slytherin) is kept. They inhabit the lake surrounding the island where the locket is; if the water is disturbed through means other than the enchanted boat, they will attack the intruder, killing them if they have consumed the emerald potion in the locket&#x27;s cauldron.

===Horcrux===

A Horcrux is an object created using dark magic to attain a type of immortality. The concept is first introduced in the sixth novel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, although Horcruxes are present in earlier novels without being explained or identified as such.

To create a Horcrux, a witch or wizard must first prepare the chosen object in a ritual which Rowling described only as &quot;too horrible to go into detail about&quot;. Following the preparation of the object, the witch or wizard must then take a life, an act which splits the soul. Following that, further dark rituals are required in order to remove the soul shard from the maker and place it into the prepared object. Once this is done, the Horcrux becomes magically protected from almost all forms of destruction, requiring extremely powerful magic or especially destructive substances to do so.

Ordinarily, when one&#x27;s body is killed, the soul departs for the next world. If, however, the body of a Horcrux maker is killed, that portion of his soul which was still in his body will not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non-corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard. If all of someone&#x27;s Horcruxes are destroyed, then his soul&#x27;s only anchor in the material world would be his body, the destruction of which would then cause his final death. To destroy the Horcrux, the destroyer must destroy it in such a way that it is put beyond magical repair.

==Magic at Hogwarts==

At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, students must study certain core subjects for the first two years. These compulsory subjects are Astronomy, Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, History of Magic, Potions and Transfiguration. Flying lessons are also required during the first year. At the start of their third year, students are required to add at least two elective subjects. The five choices are Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination and Muggle Studies.

==Portraits==
In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, characters depicted in painted portraits can move, interact with living observers, speak and demonstrate emotion and personality. Some can travel to other portraits. The headmaster&#x27;s office at Hogwarts contains portraits of past headmasters, which advise the current headmaster. Individuals depicted in wizarding photographs cannot speak, but they can move around and leave the frame if they choose.

<text>The Patuxent River is a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay in the state of Maryland. There are three main river drainages for central Maryland: the Potomac River to the west passing through Washington, D.C., the Patapsco River to the northeast passing through Baltimore, and the Patuxent River between the two. The Patuxent watershed had a rapidly growing population of 590,769 in 2000. It is the largest and longest river entirely within Maryland, and its watershed is the largest completely within the state.

==Geography==
The river source, from the Chesapeake, is in the hills of the Maryland Piedmont near the intersection of four counties – Howard, Frederick, Montgomery and Carroll, and only from Parr&#x27;s Spring, the source of the south fork of the Patapsco River. Flowing in a generally southeastward direction, the Patuxent crosses the urbanized corridor between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and opens up into a navigable tidal estuary near the colonial seaport of Queen Anne in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, just southeast of Bowie. The river is bounded by significant marsh areas for from the Waysons Corner area to the Hunting Creek confluence. The -long tidal estuary is never wider than .

It marks the boundary between Montgomery, Prince George&#x27;s, Charles and St. Mary&#x27;s counties on the west and Howard, Anne Arundel, and Calvert counties on the east. The Chesapeake estuary&#x27;s deepest point, below sea level, is in the lower Patuxent.

The two largest cities in the watershed are Bowie and Laurel, Maryland. There is a percentage of agricultural activity in the region as well. The mid and lower banks of the river have swamp and marshland ecosystems. Many of those ecosystems are protected by some form of parkland, on the state and local levels. The most notable of which include Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary, Merkle Wetlands Sanctuary in the Edgar A. Merkle Wildlife Refuge, and Patuxent River Park, along with many more. Farther north, there is the 20 square mile Patuxent Research Refuge, which helps to protect Patuxent River wildlife.

===Tributaries===
The Little Patuxent River, the Middle Patuxent River, and the Western Branch are the three largest tributaries. The Middle Patuxent flows into the Little Patuxent just upstream from the historic Savage Mill in Savage. The Little Patuxent then joins the Patuxent just southwest of Crofton. The Middle Patuxent flows through the middle of Howard County, while the Little Patuxent flows through northeast and southeast Howard County and western Anne Arundel County. Western Branch originates under the name Folly Branch in the Wingate Drive area of the northern part of Glenn Dale, assuming the name &quot;Western Branch&quot; in Woodmore, continuing southward through Prince George&#x27;s County, joined by Collington Branch before it joins the Patuxent near Upper Marlboro.

==History==

Native Americans have lived along the Patuxent River since at least 1100 BC. An archaeological dig at Pig Point (just north of Jug Bay at the end of Wrighton Road ) uncovered some of the oldest known artifacts in the Mid Atlantic states, including pottery, arrow and spear points, and remnants of wigwams, fires and foodways. The site was probably a center of trade in the region and has one of the best unbroken archaeological records on the East Coast. The Pig Point site includes remnants of the oldest structures ever found in Maryland, wigwam post holes dating to the third century.

The word &quot;Patuxent&quot; is derived from the Algonquin language used by the indigenous people living in the area prior to the arrival of the European settlers. Its meaning is debated. According to some sources it means &quot;water running over loose stones&quot; while others believe it means the &quot;place where tobacco grows&quot;.

The Patuxent River was first named (&quot;Pawtuxunt&quot;) on the detailed map resulting from the 1608 voyage upriver by Jamestown, Virginia settler John Smith.
Captain Smith got as far as the rough vicinity of the present-day Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary (Lyons Creek) area, from the Chesapeake near what is now the Anne Arundel–Calvert–Prince George&#x27;s County tripoint.
This was most likely the second visit by Europeans to the Patuxent, as in June 1588 a small Spanish expedition under Vicente Gonzalez is believed to have anchored for the night in the Patuxent mouth.

The river was an important colonial shipping port with the government&#x27;s garrison situated at the mouth of the river where Charles Calvert was first Collector in 1673. In 1699, Thomas Browne, sometimes referred to as &#x27;The Patuxent Ranger&#x27;, followed the river from the Snowden plantation to where Clarksville is sited. In 1702 George Plater I was the Patuxent naval officer (later based at Sotterley Plantation), having earlier served as Collector after Calvert, Rousby, Sewall, Digges, and Payne held the collectorship.
By the mid and late seventeenth century respectively, colonists spread upriver to Mt. Calvert and Billingsley Point, two 18th-century mansions upriver from the Chesapeake that are today part of Patuxent River Park. By 1705, the Snowden iron ore furnace (also known as the Patuxent Iron Works) just southeast of Laurel,
was shipping &quot;pig iron&quot; downriver from the current vicinity of the 1783 Montpelier Mansion, also part of Patuxent River Park.

In August 1814, Commodore Joshua Barney and his Chesapeake Bay Flotilla were trapped in the Patuxent by the British fleet under Admiral Sir George Cockburn. To keep them from British hands, Barney&#x27;s men ignited the magazines of his ships in the four mile (6 km) stretch above Pig Point ( upriver from the Chesapeake when the British approached. The British then launched their attack on Washington, D.C., from their warships in the Patuxent at Benedict, away. From there, the troops marched through Nottingham, Upper Marlboro, Bladensburg, and on to Washington.

==Economy and commerce==
Tobacco farming dominated the Patuxent&#x27;s economy for the two centuries following white settlement, with about sixty percent of Maryland&#x27;s tobacco coming from the Patuxent valley by the late eighteenth century.

Destruction of the plantations by the British and of the soil by centuries of tobacco farming brought the mid and lower Patuxent valley into a period of decline that would last until the 1930s, when there were fewer residents in the Patuxent&#x27;s Calvert County than there were in the 1840s, and only a few hundred more than in the first Calvert County census in 1790.

The Patuxent was plied by regular steamship service, mostly from the Weems Line, from the 1820s to the 1920s, replacing the schooners and sailing packets that had for the previous centuries served the river&#x27;s many landings and docks along the tidal reach.

The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission constructed two dams on the main branch in the mid-twentieth century. Brighton Dam was constructed from the Chesapeake in 1943, impounding the waters of Triadelphia Reservoir; in 1952 the T. Howard Duckett Dam was constructed farther downstream, near Laurel, thus creating Rocky Gorge Reservoir. The land surrounding the two reservoirs is administered by the WSSC, creating a forested reserve of accessible to the public for horseback riding, hunting, fishing, and picnicking in limited areas. The state of Maryland classifies the T. Howard Duckett Dam as &quot;high hazard&quot; because large releases of water flood areas of North Laurel.

With public recreational land on one or both shores of 74 of the river&#x27;s 115 miles including the reservoir land, the impact that recreation in natural settings now has on the river&#x27;s economy is obvious. The Patuxent Naval Air Station at the mouth of the river has continued to grow during past decades along with tourism, providing another main economic engine in the lower river valley that includes the popular boating center of Solomons.

The Patuxent River is the sole known source for Maryland&#x27;s State Gemstone, a form of agate called Patuxent River stone.

==Environmental concerns==
According to EcoHealth Report Cards, the Patuxent River has a below average health rating, scoring a 38%, compared to the Chesapeake&#x27;s over all health rating of 54%, as of 2016. However, the river does have higher ratings in dissolved oxygen, and likely, will soon have higher ratings in phosphorus.

The Middle and Little Patuxent watersheds include nearly all of Columbia, Maryland, including its downtown urban Lake Kittamaqundi and Wilde Lake. Columbia is a large planned community in Howard County that opened in 1967. Columbia&#x27;s major downtown roadway is called Little Patuxent Parkway, and Maryland Route 175 in East Columbia was known as the Patuxent Parkway until May 2006, when it was renamed for Columbia&#x27;s founder, the late James Rouse, and his wife, Patty. It was the largely unchecked erosion from this late 1960s and 1970s building spree that contributed the bulk of the Patuxent River&#x27;s highest and most damaging sediment, siltation, and pollution levels to date downstream. This in turn led to a nearly complete destruction of a once thriving seafood industry along the brackish portion of the river.

&quot;The Patuxent River has known no greater friend, advocate, and defender than Bernie Fowler.&quot; Fowler, as an early-1970s Calvert County commissioner, led the way in a lawsuit filed by downriver Charles, Calvert and St. Mary&#x27;s counties against upriver counties. The lawsuit forced the state, the upriver counties, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enact pollution control measures. Between 1985 and 2005, the Patuxent saw a 26% decrease in nitrogen, a 46% decrease in phosphorus, and a 35% reduction in sediment, despite urban areas increasing to 31% of the watershed by 2002. Of the Chesapeake&#x27;s major tributaries, the Patuxent is the only one having most of its harmful phosphorus and nitrogen nutrient overloads coming from urban runoff. The river&#x27;s other two largest contributors, point sources (industrial, sewage, etc.) and the declining (24%) agricultural areas, contribute less of the nutrient load. Forested areas account for 43% of the watershed.

In 2004, Fred Tutman became the first &quot;Riverkeeper&quot; for the Patuxent. The mission of the Patuxent Riverkeeper organization, a member of the worldwide Waterkeeper Alliance, is to protect and improve the quality of the river&#x27;s water and watershed and provide access and education at its facility in Nottingham.

Over the past 50 years, nationally recognized land preservation efforts in this part of Maryland have saved tens of thousands of acres from the Baltimore-Washington bedroom community sprawl. The southern half of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Meade was added to the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, which, at , is the second largest contiguous public park-refuge within of either Washington or Baltimore. It is located midway between these two cities. The contiguous public area of centered on Jug Bay, upriver from the Chesapeake, form the fifth largest such Baltimore-D.C. preserve and largest tidewater one and consist of the Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary, the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Jug Bay component of the Patuxent River Park. The Patuxent River State Park in the uppermost part of the basin is the seventh largest.
===Chesapeake Bay Week video releases, 2022===
On 20 April 2022, PBS released a 26 minute documentary: &quot;Troubled Tributary: Maryland&#x27;s Patuxent River&quot; - &quot;The Patuxent River is a crucial tributary of the Chesapeake Bay. Despite the central role the river has played in the history of the Bay&#x27;s environmental movement and abundant conservation resources funneled to it over the years, it remains polluted. Its riverkeeper, Fred Tutman, believes that environmental injustice exists along its banks.&quot;

On 21 April 2022, PBS released a 56 minute special: &quot;The Chesapeake Bay Summit 2022&quot; - &quot;Experts, scientists and policy makers converge for a compelling discussion on the health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, led by host Frank Sesno.&quot;

<doc id="310378" wikidata="Q5127432" url="?curid=310378" title="Clark Y airfoil">
<text>Clark Y is the name of a particular airfoil profile, widely used in general purpose aircraft designs, and much studied in aerodynamics over the years. The profile was designed in 1922 by Virginius E. Clark using thickness distribution of the German-developed Goettingen 398 airfoil. The airfoil has a thickness of 11.7 percent and is flat on the lower surface aft of 30 percent of chord. The flat bottom simplifies angle measurements on propellers, and makes for easy construction of wings.

For many applications the Clark Y has been an adequate airfoil section; it gives reasonable overall performance in respect of its lift-to-drag ratio, and has gentle and relatively benign stall characteristics. The flat lower surface is not optimal from an aerodynamic perspective, and it is rarely used in modern designs.
The Clark YH airfoil is similar but with a reflexed (turned up) trailing edge producing a more positive pitching moment reducing the horizontal tail load required to trim an aircraft.

==Applications==
===Aircraft===
The Lockheed Vega and Spirit of St. Louis are two of the better known aircraft using the Clark Y profile, while the Ilyushin Il-2 and Hawker Hurricane are examples of mass-produced users of the Clark YH.

The Northrop Tacit Blue stealth technology demonstrator aircraft also used a Clark Y. The Clark Y was chosen as its flat bottom worked well with the design goal of a low radar cross-section.

===Model aircraft===
The Clark Y has found favor for the construction of model aircraft, thanks to the flight performance that the section offers at medium Reynolds number airflows. Applications range from free-flight gliders through to multi-engined radio control scale models.

The Clark Y is appealing for its near-flat lower surface, which aids in the construction of wings on plans mounted on a flat construction board. Inexperienced modellers are more readily able to build model aircraft which provide a good flight performance with benign stalling characteristics.

===Cars===
An inverted Clark Y airfoil was used on the spoilers of the Dodge Charger Daytona and Plymouth Superbird. 

==Aircraft==
Some of the better-known aircraft that use the Clark Y and YH:

;Clark Y
*Aeronca 50 Chief
*Avia B.122
*Consolidated PT-1 to Fleet Fawn (all intermediate designs used the same section)

<text>Brandon Tartikoff (January 13, 1949 – August 27, 1997) was an American television executive who was head of the entertainment division of NBC from 1981 to 1991. He was credited with turning around NBC&#x27;s low prime time reputation with several hit series: &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Wings&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, and &quot;Night Court&quot;.

Tartikoff also helped develop the 1984 sitcom &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;; he named the title character after a girl he had a crush on in school. He was also involved in the creation of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Beggars and Choosers&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family in Freeport, New York, Tartikoff was a graduate of Lawrenceville School and Yale University, where he contributed to campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;.

While attending Yale, Tartikoff worked as an account executive and sales manager for WNHC-TV in New Haven, Connecticut, as well as in Hartford, Connecticut. Tartikoff spent vacations in Los Angeles looking for a job in network television. After graduating from Yale, he took a series of jobs in advertising and local television, including WLS-TV in Chicago, Illinois.

==Career==
Tartikoff was hired as a program executive at ABC in 1976. One year later, he moved to NBC (after being hired by Dick Ebersol to direct comedy programming). Tartikoff took over programming duties at NBC from Fred Silverman in 1981. At age 32, Tartikoff became the youngest president of NBC&#x27;s entertainment division.

When Tartikoff took over, NBC was in last place behind ABC and CBS, and the future of the network was in doubt. A writers&#x27; strike was looming, affiliates were defecting, mostly to ABC, and the network had only three prime time shows in the Top 20: &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;Real People&quot;. Johnny Carson was reportedly in talks to move his landmark late-night talk show to ABC. The entire cast and writers of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; had left that late-night sketch-comedy series, and their replacements had received some of the show&#x27;s worst critical notices (except for fellow cast members Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo who stayed with SNL until 1984). By 1982, Tartikoff and his new superior, the former producer Grant Tinker, began to turn the network&#x27;s fortunes around.

As head of NBC&#x27;s Entertainment Division, Tartikoff&#x27;s successes included &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, for which he had pursued Bill Cosby to create a pilot after having been impressed by Cosby&#x27;s stories when Cosby guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Tartikoff wrote a brainstorming memo that simply read &quot;MTV cops&quot;, and later presented the memo to series creator Anthony Yerkovich, formerly a writer and producer for &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. The result was &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, which became an icon of 1980s pop culture. &quot;Knight Rider&quot; was inspired by a perceived lack of leading men who could act, with Tartikoff suggesting that a talking car could fill in the gaps in any leading man&#x27;s acting abilities.

During the casting process of &quot;Family Ties&quot;, Tartikoff was unexcited about Michael J. Fox for the role of Alex P. Keaton. However, the show&#x27;s producer, Gary David Goldberg, insisted until Tartikoff relented saying, &quot;Go ahead if you insist. But I&#x27;m telling you, this is not the kind of face you&#x27;ll ever see on a lunch box.&quot; Some years later, after the movie &quot;Back to the Future&quot; cemented Fox&#x27;s stardom, Fox goodnaturedly sent Tartikoff a lunch box with Fox&#x27;s picture on it, with a handwritten note reading: &quot;Brandon, They wanted me to put a crow in here, but ... Love and Kisses, Michael J.&quot; Tartikoff kept the lunch box on display in his office.

Jerry Seinfeld credited Tartikoff with saving &quot;Seinfeld&quot; from cancellation during its first four years of struggling ratings. Johnny Carson broke the news of his retirement in February 1991 to Tartikoff at the Grille in Beverly Hills. For several days, only Tartikoff and NBC chairman Bob Wright knew of the planned retirement.

Tartikoff wrote in his memoirs that his biggest professional regret was cancelling the series &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, which he later went on to include in a fantasy &quot;dream schedule&quot; created for a &quot;TV Guide&quot; article that detailed his idea of &quot;The Greatest Network Ever&quot;.

During his time at NBC, he made appearances in several of the network&#x27;s shows. He was played by David Leisure in &quot;Prime Time,&quot; episode five of season two of &quot;ALF&quot;. In the penultimate scene when ALF suggests a sitcom about a family hosting a lovable alien, he replies &quot;Not in a million years, pal, it&#x27;s too far-fetched.&quot; He hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1983 and appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, where he briefly entertains the notion of a &quot;show about a high school principal and his kids&quot;, before scoffing at the idea. During his 1983 appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, one skit featured Tartikoff in a black leather ensemble, with the words &quot;Be There&quot; spelled out in rhinestones on the back of his jacket. &quot;Be There&quot; was NBC&#x27;s slogan during the 1983–84 season. Tartikoff appeared as himself on episodes of &quot;Night Court&quot; and &quot;Night Stand with Dick Dietrick&quot;, and in the background of one of the final episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot;.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1991, Tartikoff was involved in a car crash near the family&#x27;s Lake Tahoe home that injured him and his eight-year-old daughter Calla, who suffered a severe brain injury and received intense therapy in order to walk and speak again.

He left NBC, moving to Paramount Pictures to become its chairman from July 1, 1991. His first film was &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot;.

Just over a year later, Tartikoff left that post to spend more time with his recovering daughter in New Orleans. The biggest hit of his reign was &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. After he left Paramount, he started Moving Target Productions in 1992, and his first work was a joint effort with MCA TV in 1993.

In 1994, he made his comeback to national TV with &quot;Last Call&quot;, a short-lived late-night discussion show he produced. That same year he also produced &quot;The Steven Banks Show&quot; for PBS. Later that year, he began a brief run as chairman of New World Entertainment, from 1994 to 1996. Shortly after New World bought out Moving Target Productions, he renamed his production company to MT2 Services (short for Moving Target 2), and instrumental in developing &quot;Strange Luck&quot; for Fox and &quot;Second Noah&quot; for ABC. Through MT2 Services, he also developed the failed Marvel TV pilot &quot;Generation X&quot; for Fox.

Just prior to his death, Tartikoff served as the chairman of the AOL project Entertainment Asylum, for which he teamed with Scott Zakarin to build the world&#x27;s first interactive broadcast studio. He also continued to do on-air appearances on shows such as &quot;Dave&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Arli$$&quot;. In 1996, he left New World Entertainment, following the announcement of its purchase by News Corporation, and then subsequently started H. Beale Company.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Tartikoff married Lilly Samuels, and the couple had two daughters, Calla Lianne and Elizabeth Justine. Princess Calla on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; was named for Calla Tartikoff.

Tartikoff&#x27;s parents were survivors of the collision of two 747s in Tenerife, Canary Islands, in 1977.

==Death==
Tartikoff died on August 27, 1997, at age 48 from Hodgkin lymphoma, a disease with which he had three separate bouts over 25 years. He was interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. The &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; sixth-season premiere, &quot;A Time to Stand&quot;, began with a title card reading &quot;In memory of Brandon Tartikoff.&quot; A similar card appeared at the end of the ninth-season premiere of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Butter Shave&quot;. On August 29, 1997, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; ran an extended tribute to Tartikoff that featured many famous figures whose careers he had influenced, including Warren Littlefield, Dick Ebersol, Bill Cosby, Michael J. Fox, Ted Danson, and Jerry Seinfeld.

Tartikoff, through H. Beale Company, posthumously produced the TV pilots &quot;Blade Squad&quot; in 1998 and the TV show &quot;Beggars and Choosers&quot;; it aired from 1999 to 2001.

<text>Closed communion is the practice of restricting the serving of the elements of Holy Communion (also called Eucharist, The Lord&#x27;s Supper) to those who are members in good standing of a particular church, denomination, sect, or congregation. Though the meaning of the term varies slightly in different Christian theological traditions, it generally means that a church or denomination limits participation (with respect to the Eucharist) either to members of their own church, members of their own denomination, or members of some specific class (e.g., baptized members of evangelical churches). This restriction is based on various parameters, one of which is baptism. See also intercommunion.

A closed-communion church is one that excludes certain individuals (it specifically identifies) from receiving the communion. This standard varies from church to church. This is the known practice of most traditional churches that pre-date the Protestant Reformation. Other churches following the Protestant Reformation have their own rules of restrictions. In current churches of various denominations, across the spectrum, the rules of participating in the Eucharist are varied.

Churches which practice open communion allow all Christians to partake in the Lord&#x27;s Supper, with membership in a particular Christian community not required to receive bread and wine; this in contrast to pre-Reformation churches, which hold that what is received in their celebrations ceases to be bread and wine.

==Practice==

===Roman Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic Church practices closed communion. However, provided that &quot;necessity requires it or true spiritual advantage suggests it&quot; and that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided, canon 844 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law of the Latin Church and the parallel canon 671 allow, in particular exceptional circumstances that are regulated by the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops, members who cannot approach a Catholic minister to receive the Eucharist from ministers of churches that have a valid Eucharist. It also permits properly disposed members of the Eastern churches who are not in full communion with the Roman Church (Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and Assyrian Church of the East), and of churches judged to be in the same situation with regard to the sacraments to receive the Eucharist from Catholic ministers, if they seek it of their own accord. The Catholic Church distinguishes between Churches whose celebration of the Eucharist, as well as holy orders, it recognizes as valid and those of other Christian communities. In the case that it is impossible to approach a Catholic minister, that it is a case of real need or spiritual benefit, and that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided, the Catholic Church permits its faithful to receive Communion in Orthodox Churches, although Orthodox Churches do not honour this and only permit Orthodox Christians to receive Communion in Orthodox Churches. The Catholic Church does not ordinarily allow a Catholic to receive communion in a Protestant church, since it does not consider Protestant ministers to be priests ordained by bishops in a line of valid succession from the apostles, although Moravians, Anglicans and some Lutherans teach that they ordain their clergy in lines of apostolic succession. It applies this rule also to the Anglican Communion, pursuant to &quot;Apostolicae curae&quot;, a position that the Church of England disputed in &quot;Saepius officio&quot;. However, a non-Catholic Christian, as with a Catholic Christian who has not yet received his or her First Communion, may come forward in the line, with his/her arms crossed over the chest, in order to receive a blessing, in lieu of Holy Communion:

This blessing giving to those who are not communing is a short prayer, with the following being prescribed by the Auckland Diocesan Liturgy Office: “May the Lord bless you. Amen.” or “May the Love of God be in your heart. Amen.” or “May Father, Son and Holy Spirit bless you. Amen.”

The &quot;Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism&quot; warns that &quot;due consideration should be given to the discipline of the Eastern Churches for their own faithful and any suggestion of proselytism should be avoided.&quot; Recognizing that &quot;that everyone in a marriage that binds denominations,&quot; the Catholic Church in Germany has produced a pastoral handout allowing Lutheran and Reformed spouses of Roman Catholics to receive Communion from Roman Catholic ministers in certain cases, &#x27;provided they “affirm the Catholic faith in the Eucharist.”&#x27; Thus far, Archbishop Hans-Josef Becker (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn), Archbishop Stefan Heße (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg), Archbishop Ludwig Schick (Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda), and Bishop Franz Jung (Roman Catholic Diocese of Würzburg) have implemented the pastoral document, in addition to Bishops Gerhard Feige of Magdeburg and Franz-Josef Bode of Osnabrück declaring their intention to implement the pastoral document well. Bishop Franz Jung, while celebrating a Jubilee Mass on July 5 at Würzburg Cathedral, called inter-denominational marriages &quot;denomination-uniting&quot; and thus &quot;especially invited&quot; couples in which one spouse is Protestant to receive the Eucharist during his sermon.

Other Western Christians under the jurisdiction of other episcopal conferences are limited by stricter conditions. Those who do personally share Catholic belief in the Eucharist (as the body and blood of the risen Christ, accompanied by his soul and divinity, under the appearances of bread and wine) are permitted to receive the sacrament when there is danger of death or, in the judgment of the diocesan bishop or of the episcopal conference, some other grave necessity urges it and on condition that &quot;the person be unable to have recourse for the sacrament to a minister of his or her own Church or ecclesial Community, ask for the sacrament of his or her own initiative, manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament and be properly disposed&quot;.

Exceptions do occur, however. Notably, Pope John Paul II gave Holy Communion to Brother Roger, a Reformed pastor and founder of the Taizé Community, several times; in addition Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) also gave Brother Roger the Eucharist. Moreover, after Brother Roger&#x27;s death, at the Mass celebrated for him in France, &quot;communion wafers were given to the faithful indiscriminately, regardless of denomination&quot;.

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
The Eastern Orthodox Church, comprising 14 to 16 autocephalous Orthodox hierarchical churches, is even more strictly a closed-communion Church. Thus, a member of the Russian Orthodox Church attending the Divine Liturgy in a Greek Orthodox Church will be allowed to receive communion and &quot;vice versa&quot; but, although Protestants, non-Trinitarian Christians, or Catholics may otherwise fully participate in an Orthodox Divine Liturgy, they will be excluded from communion. In the strictest sense, non-Orthodox may be present at the Divine Liturgy only up to the exclamation &quot;The doors! The doors!&quot; and ought to leave the church after that. However, this attitude has been relaxed in most Orthodox churches; a non-communicant may stay and participate in the Divine Liturgy but may not partake of the Eucharist. Thus, while in certain circumstances the Catholic Church allows its faithful who cannot approach a Catholic minister to receive the Eucharist from an Eastern Orthodox priest, the Eastern Orthodox Church does not admit them to receive the Eucharist from its ministers. At the very end of the Divine Liturgy, all people are invited to come up to receive a little piece of bread, called antidoron, which is blessed but not consecrated, being taken from the same loaf as the bread used in the consecration. Non-Orthodox present at the Liturgy are not only permitted but even encouraged to receive the blessed bread as an expression of Christian fellowship and love.

The Eastern Orthodox Church is not in Communion with the Roman Church, nor is it in Communion with any Protestant denominational church. Eastern Orthodox Christians are forbidden from receiving Communion in any church other than Eastern Orthodox. Eastern Orthodox Churches accept to Holy Communion only baptized Eastern Orthodox Christians (such as Bulgarian Orthodox, Georgian Orthodox, Albanian Orthodox, etc.), and then only when they have prepared themselves by prayer, by appropriate fasting, and by confession of sins (although the frequency of confession varies between traditions). In addition, Orthodox bishops and other teachers make clear to their faithful that they can only properly receive communion from a canonically ordained priest or bishop within the context of the traditional Orthodox Divine Liturgy (which includes communion taken to the sick).

===Lutheran Churches===

Confessional Lutheran churches, including the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, practice &quot;closed communion&quot; and require catechetical instruction for all people before receiving the Eucharist. Failing to do so is condemned by these Lutherans as the sin of unionism. This teaching comes from 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 which says, &quot;Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf&quot; and Paul&#x27;s teaching of fellowship in 1 Corinthians 1:10, &quot;I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.&quot; These Lutherans also take seriously God&#x27;s threat in 1 Corinthians 11:27,29 that &quot;Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of this cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.&quot; Therefore, the belief is that, inviting those forward who have not been first instructed would be unloving on the church&#x27;s part, because they would be inviting people forward to sin. This is described as akin to letting someone drink poison without stopping him.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest Lutheran Church in America, however, does not practice closed communion, but rather &quot;eucharistic hospitality.&quot; In terms of guests receiving the Sacrament, according to this practice, the burden of decision of admittance to the Sacrament is not on the host congregation, but on its guests. The invitation to the Sacrament is extended to &quot;all baptized persons,&quot; along with &quot;a brief written or oral statement in worship which teaches Christ&#x27;s presence in the sacrament.&quot; In terms of members receiving the Sacrament, reception of the Sacrament is always to include &quot;continuing catechesis [which] include[s] instruction for Holy Communion,&quot; but this is not a prerequisite for first communion, and even infants may be permitted to receive the Sacrament at or after the service of their baptism.

Those not communing are invited to come forward with their &quot;arms crossed across their chest&quot; in order to receive a blessing from the priest.

Many Lutheran churches restrict the allowance to commune to those who are validly baptized (usually understood to be all trinitarian baptisms done with the intent of bringing the baptized into the church catholic), but with no further restrictions beyond that. Major examples of this include the Nordic lutheran churches, such as the Church of Sweden

===Baptists===
Some Baptists and all American Baptist Association congregations practice &quot;closed communion&quot; even more strictly than do the Catholic, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox churches. They restrict the partaking of communion (or the Lord&#x27;s Supper) to members of the local church observing the ordinance. Thus members from other churches, even members of other local churches of the same denomination, are excluded from participation. The Strict Baptists in the United Kingdom derive their name from this practice. In the United States the custom is usually, but not exclusively, associated with Landmark ecclesiology.

The closed communion practiced by Primitive Baptists admits participation by Primitive Baptists who do not belong to the local church.

===Other groups===
The Orthodox Presbyterian Church, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, the American Presbyterian Church the Reformed Seventh-day Adventist Church, Exclusive Brethren, the Apostolic Christian Church, the Church of the Brethren, Mennonites, Amish, some Anglicans, the Church of God in Christ, the Church of God of Prophecy, and some other churches in the Reformed tradition such as Calvinists also practice closed communion. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses hold that only the 144,000 should receive communion. Other nontrinitarian Christians that practice closed communion include the Church of God (Seventh Day), Christadelphians, and Oneness Pentecostals such as the True Jesus Church.

Churches of Christ, though doctrinally holding to a closed communion view, in practice do not prohibit visitors from taking communion, on the view that per 1 Corinthians 11:28 the visitor must &quot;examine himself&quot; and decide to partake or decline (i.e. it is not for the minister, elders/deacons, or members to decide who may or may not partake); thus, it is more a form of open communion.

===Latter Day Saints===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) practices closed communion, but does not take any measures to prevent others from participating. The Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) practices open communion.

==&quot;Close Communion&quot;==

Among the modern descendants of the Anabaptists, the Amish, Old Order Mennonites and Conservative Mennonites all practice what they term &quot;close communion&quot;, restricting communion to members of a local congregation only.

The term &quot;close communion&quot; normally means the same thing as &quot;closed communion&quot;. However, some make a distinction, so the terms can be a source of confusion.

The most prominent distinction (which in some circles may be called &quot;cracked communion&quot;) is one where a member of a congregation holding the &quot;same faith and practice&quot; as the hosting congregation (generally meaning being a member of a congregation in the same or a similar denomination) may participate in the service, but a member of another denomination may or may not.

For example, a Southern Baptist congregation practicing close communion:
*would allow a member of another Southern Baptist congregation to participate, on the premise that both congregations are of the &quot;same faith and practice&quot; as they are both in the same denomination, and
*would (most likely) also allow a member of an Independent Baptist congregation to participate; though the congregations are of different Baptist groups the differences between them are mainly in the area of church organization and not in doctrinal issues, thus falling under the &quot;same faith and practice&quot; rule, and also
*might or might not allow a member of a Pentecostal church to participate (might on the basis of both having similar views on salvation and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, but might not due to other significant differences), but
*would almost certainly exclude a Lutheran or Catholic, on the basis that Baptists and Lutherans/Catholics are not of the &quot;same faith and practice&quot; as pertaining to the Lord&#x27;s Supper.
*In practice, churches that do not require people to approach a communion table usually pass the elements among the attendees (similar to the offering plate) or provide them ahead of time in a self-serve manner, and as such do not actively prohibit anyone who wishes to partake from doing so, regardless of personal views.

The Reformed Presbyterian Church of Australia allows communion to those who can assent to the first three terms of its church covenants, and discuss this with the elders ahead of time. They don&#x27;t appear to distinguish the term &quot;close communion&quot; from &quot;closed communion&quot;, though.

The earliest use of &quot;close communion&quot; comes from a mistranslation of the Lutheran theologian Franz August Otto Pieper&#x27;s &quot;Christian Dogmatics&quot;. The term has since spread, although both the first edition and later translations corrected the error to &quot;closed communion.&quot;

==Supporting belief==
Complex reasons underlie the belief. In 1 Corinthians 10, it is written: &quot;The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? For we, being many, are one bread, one body: all that partake of one bread.&quot; Since all Christians are now no longer of a unity that would allow common celebration of the Eucharist between them all, the bread being a visible sign of union, communion is not taken together between separated Churches and communities. Additionally as described in 1 Corinthians 11:29: &quot;For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord&#x27;s body.&quot; It is deemed better to prevent outsiders from taking communion than to risk them taking communion &quot;unworthily&quot;. Catholics thus see the communion as sinful for those who do not recognise the Real Presence or who are otherwise &#x27;unworthy&#x27;, i.e. who are not in the &#x27;right place&#x27; to accept the Eucharist (free of mortal sin). Christian communities that keep close communion often also have accountability within those members that partake of the communion, so that they do not run afoul of this problem. Such communities will also delay taking communion until the members (the church body) can take communion in Christian unity, as required by 1Co 11:33 &quot;Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.&quot;

Justin Martyr indicated that the second-century Christian Church had three requirements for sharing in the Eucharist: identity of belief, Christian baptism, and moral life. &quot;No one may share in the eucharist except those who believe in the truth of our teachings and have been washed in the bath which confers forgiveness of sins and rebirth, and who live according to Christ&#x27;s commands&quot; (&quot;First Apology&quot;, 66).

Corporate responsibility is another argument often used in favour of closed communion. The Heidelberg Catechism, for example, says that those who &quot;by confession and life, declare themselves unbelieving and ungodly&quot; are not to be admitted to the Lord&#x27;s Supper, for then &quot;the covenant of God would be profaned, and his wrath kindled against the whole congregation.&quot; Church leaders are obliged to do all they can to ensure that this does not happen, and hence &quot;exclude such persons... till they show amendment of life,&quot; (Q &amp; A 82).

==Fenced table==

In Protestant theology, a fenced table is a communion table which is open only to accredited members of the Christian community. Fencing the table is thus the opposite of open communion, where the invitation to the sacrament is extended to &quot;all who love the Lord&quot; and members of any denomination are welcome at their own discretion.

The phrase goes back to early Scottish Calvinism, where the communion table literally had a fence around it, with a gate at each end. The members of the congregation were allowed to pass the gate on showing their communion token, a specially minted coin which served as an admission ticket and was given only to those who were in good standing with the local congregation and could pass a test of the catechism. Examples of this kind of church furnishing are still to be seen in a very few highland churches.

The phrase &quot;fencing the table&quot; is also used metaphorically for other kinds of group demarcation and restrictive practices.

==Communion tokens==

Many Scottish Protestant churches used to give tokens to members passing a religious test prior to the day of communion, then required the token for entry. Some US and other churches also used communion tokens.

<text>The Cayman Trough (also known as the Cayman Trench, Bartlett Deep and Bartlett Trough) is a complex transform fault zone pull-apart basin which contains a small spreading ridge, the Mid-Cayman Rise, on the floor of the western Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. It is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. It extends from the Windward Passage, going south of the Sierra Maestra of Cuba toward Guatemala. The transform fault continues onshore as the Polochic-Motagua fault system, which consists of the Polochic and Motagua faults. This system continues on until the Chiapas massif where it is part of the diffuse triple junction of the North American, Caribbean and Cocos plates.

The relatively narrow trough trends east-northeast to west-southwest and has a maximum depth of . Within the trough is a slowly spreading north–south ridge which may be the result of an offset or gap of approximately along the main fault trace. The Cayman spreading ridge shows a long-term opening rate of The eastern section of the trough has been named the Gonâve Microplate. The Gonâve plate extends from the spreading ridge east to the island of Hispaniola. It is bounded on the north by the Oriente and Septentrional fault zones. On the south the Gonâve is bounded by the Walton fault zone, the Jamaica restraining bend and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone. The two bounding strike slip fault zones are left lateral. The motion relative to the North American Plate is to the east and the motion relative to the Caribbean Plate is . The western section of the trough is bounded to its south by the Swan Islands Transform Fault.

During the Eocene the trough was the site of a subduction zone which formed the volcanic arc of the Cayman Ridge and the Sierra Maestra volcanic terrain of Cuba to the north, as the northeastward-moving Caribbean Plate was subducted beneath the southwest-moving North American Plate, or as some researchers contend, beneath a plate fragment dubbed the East Cuban Microplate.

In 2010 a UK team from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton (NOCS), equipped with an autonomously controlled robot submarine, began mapping the full extent of the trench and discovered black smokers on the ocean floor at a depth of , the deepest yet found. In January 2012, the researchers announced that water exits the vents at a temperature possibly exceeding , making them among the hottest known undersea vents. They also announced the discovery of new species, including an eyeless shrimp with a light-sensing organ on its back.

<doc id="310394" wikidata="Q1452598" url="?curid=310394" title="Topsail">
<text>A topsail (&quot;tops&#x27;l&quot;) is a sail set above another sail; on square-rigged vessels further sails may be set above topsails.

== Square rig ==

On a square rigged vessel, a topsail is a typically trapezoidal shaped sail rigged above the course sail and below the topgallant sail where carried, on any mast (i.e., a fully rigged ship would have a foremast topsail, a mainmast topsail, and a mizzen topsail). A full rigged ship will have either single or double (i.e., &quot;split&quot; upper and lower) topsails on all masts, the single or lower topsail being the second sail above the deck and the upper topsail where so rigged being the third.

Although described as a &quot;square&quot; sail, a topsail on a full rigged ship refers not to the sail&#x27;s shape but to it and its yard being rigged square (i.e., at a right angle) to the vessel&#x27;s keel rather than in line with it (in which case it would be called a fore-and-aft rig or a fore-and-aft rigged sail) ; a square rigged topsail is nearly always trapezoidal in shape, with the lengths of the upper yards being progressively smaller the higher they are on the mast. The bottom edge of the topsail, like that of other square rigged sails, is slightly concave which allows the rigging to connect to the mast. The principal exception to this trapezoidal rule is the raffee sail, which is a square rigged topsail that is triangular (such as is seen on the foremast of the ship &quot;Denis Sullivan&quot;, a topsail schooner). A topsail which is fore-and-aft rigged is usually also triangular, but has its longest edge oriented vertically rather than horizontally as seen in the raffee sail.

Although the early Romans used a sort of fore-and-aft rigged topsail on some vessels, this sail came into prominent use in Europe some time in the 15th century. Initially small and carried only on main and fore masts, they gradually increased in size and importance until by the middle of the 17th century and were the principal and largest sails of the ship, the first sails to be set and the last to be taken in. It was quite common for a ship to sail with topsails and jibs alone; the position of the topsails well above the sea ensured that they received a steady breeze even if the seas were rough.

Because of their ability to drive a ship in lighter winds than the course sail below or any sail above, the topsail quickly became enormous and was soon difficult and dangerous to handle in strong winds. Sometime in the 1680s, reef-bands were introduced to tie up part of the sail, with topsails eventually getting four of these. In the mid 19th century topsails of merchant vessels were split into separate upper and lower topsails that could be managed independently and far more easily by significantly smaller crews (see &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; for a prominent example). Such sails were still often referred to as a single &quot;topsail&quot;, however.

Competing versions of this double topsail were invented by Robert Bennet Forbes and Captain Frederic Howes. Although Forbes strove to defend his rig, the Howe rig dominated. In the Forbes rig, both topsail yards are fixed vertically. In the Howe rig, the upper topsail yard slides on the topmast so it can be lowered in a few seconds to close reef the upper topsail. Howe had the foot of the upper topsail closely attached to the lower topsail yard. In 1865 the British clipper &quot;Ariel&quot; introduced a gap there. Forbes first tried his rig in the topsail schooner &quot;Midas&quot; in 1844.The clipper &quot;Climax&quot; built in 1853 under the supervision of Howes was the first ship with Howe rig.

== Gaff rig ==

Gaff topsails, like gaff rigs in general, may still be seen at tall ships gatherings. The gaff rig has been largely superseded by the Bermuda rig, which has no topsails. On a gaff-rigged sailing boat, topsails may take a few different forms:

* A jib-headed topsail is generally a triangular sail set between the gaff and the top of the mast or topmast. A gaff-rigged vessel might have a gaff topsail above any or all of its gaff sails.

* A yard topsail is similar, but set on a yard. Early 19th-century topsail yards were set almost horizontally, but gradually increased in angle until they became almost vertical extension of the topmast.

* A jack-yard topsail (or club topsail) instead has its lower edge (or foot) extended out beyond the end of the gaff with a short yard, called a &quot;jack-yard&quot;. A jack-yard topsail may also have the aforementioned vertical yard, although this makes for a very large topsail.

* A cornish topsail is a triangular sail having its luff extended well above the masthead by being laced to a yard hoisted by a halyard that is rove through a sheave fitted diagonally in the mast. The heel of the yard fits immediately about the gaff and is kept in place by a tackline called a &quot;timminoggy&quot;.

* A square topsail is a square-rigged sail carried above the foresail only on gaff schooners. (A brigantine is an example of a two-masted vessel with a forward course.) Schooners carrying square tops are referred to as &quot;topsail schooners&quot;; gaff topsails are taken for granted on gaff-rigged vessels and pass without comment in a vessel description.

==Other uses==

On rigs having multiple jibs or staysails of which at least one is set high, such as many late 19th and 20th Century racing cutters, the uppermost of these, set flying or on a topmast stay, is often called the jib topsail.

== Roman navigation ==
Topsails (Greek: &quot;sipharos&quot;; Latin: &quot;siparum&quot;) in the form of an isosceles triangle set above the square mainsail were used in Roman navigation.

<text>Devon is an American pornographic film actress. She was a &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet in 2001 and in 2005 co-starred in the pornographic action-adventure film &quot;Pirates&quot;, which cost over to make and was described by its producer as the most expensive pornographic film in history. 

She has worked for Digital Playground and Shane&#x27;s World, appearing in films for them and also directing for the latter. She has won a number of awards for her performances and was inducted into the &quot;AVN&quot; Hall of Fame in 2010.

== Career ==
=== Pornographic films ===
Devon&#x27;s first foray into the mainstream adult film industry came in 1998, when she appeared in the Jules Jordan film &quot;New Breed&quot;. She was the &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Month in January 2001. She worked for Vivid Entertainment for three years (1998–2001). Her first release for Vivid was &quot;Country Comfort&quot;. After her Vivid contract, she signed with Digital Playground.

In 2004, Devon appeared in the first WMV-HD DVD porn movie ever made, &quot;Island Fever 3&quot;, filmed on Tahiti and Bora Bora. In 2005, she co-starred in the adult film &quot;Pirates&quot;.
By January 2006, she had signed with Ecstasy Mobile. In March 2006, she signed with Black Kat Productions, which never produced any films with her. 

In 2006, Devon formed her own production company. In October 2006, she signed a contract with Shane&#x27;s World to appear in films and direct film scenes for the company. She made her directorial debut for Shane&#x27;s World in April 2007 with &quot;Devon Does Baja&quot;. She says she is personally most proud of &quot;Virtual Sex with Devon&quot; (2001), saying she spent more time filming it than most other titles in which she appeared.

In 2010, she was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame.

=== Mainstream appearances ===
Devon appeared in the episode &quot;Millennium&quot; (Season 1, Episode 19) of &quot;The Man Show&quot; in 1999. She appeared with fellow Digital Playground contract performers Jesse Jane and Teagan Presley in an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot;, &quot;I Love You Too&quot;, which aired July 31, 2005.

== Personal life ==
Devon is a native of Allentown, Pennsylvania. Prior to 2005, Devon dated Danny Ting, co-founder of WantedList, a pornographic DVD subscription site that sought to be the &quot;Netflix of the porn industry&quot;. She suffers from mild acrophobia. She believes being active in the sex industry has given her more confidence, making her more &quot;outgoing and aggressive&quot; about what she wants.
In 2022, she was diagnosed with colon cancer.

<doc id="310400" wikidata="Q1431196" url="?curid=310400" title="Cosmic string">
<text>Cosmic strings are hypothetical 1-dimensional topological defects which may have formed during a symmetry-breaking phase transition in the early universe when the topology of the vacuum manifold associated to this symmetry breaking was not simply connected.

In less formal terms, they are hypothetical long, thin defects in the fabric of space that might have formed according to string theory. They might have formed in the early universe during a process where certain symmetries were broken. Their existence was first contemplated by the theoretical physicist Tom Kibble in the 1970s.

The formation of cosmic strings is somewhat analogous to the imperfections that form between crystal grains in solidifying liquids, or the cracks that form when water freezes into ice. The phase transitions leading to the production of cosmic strings are likely to have occurred during the earliest moments of the universe&#x27;s evolution, just after cosmological inflation, and are a fairly generic prediction in both quantum field theory and string theory models of the early universe.

==Theories containing cosmic strings==

The prototypical example of a field theory with cosmic strings is the Abelian Higgs model. The quantum field theory and string theory cosmic strings are expected to have many properties in common, but more research is needed to determine the precise distinguishing features. The F-strings for instance are fully quantum-mechanical and do not have a classical definition, whereas the field theory cosmic strings are almost exclusively treated classically.

In superstring theory, the role of cosmic strings can be played by the fundamental strings (or F-strings) themselves that define the theory perturbatively, by D-strings which are related to the F-strings by weak-strong or so called S-duality, or higher-dimensional D-, NS- or M-branes that are partially wrapped on compact cycles associated to extra spacetime dimensions so that only one non-compact dimension remains.

==Dimensions==
Cosmic strings, if they exist, would be extremely thin topological defects with diameters of the same order of magnitude as that of a proton, i.e. , or smaller. Given that this scale is much smaller than any cosmological scale, these strings are often studied in the zero-width, or Nambu–Goto approximation. Under this assumption, strings behave as one-dimensional objects and obey the Nambu–Goto action, which is classically equivalent to the Polyakov action that defines the bosonic sector of superstring theory.

In field theory, the string width is set by the scale of the symmetry breaking phase transition. In string theory, the string width is set (in the simplest cases) by the fundamental string scale, warp factors (associated to the spacetime curvature of an internal six-dimensional spacetime manifold) and/or the size of internal compact dimensions. (In string theory, the universe is either 10- or 11-dimensional, depending on the strength of interactions and the curvature of spacetime.)

==Gravitation==

A string is a geometrical deviation from Euclidean geometry in spacetime characterized by an angular deficit: a circle around the outside of a string would comprise a total angle less than 360°. From the general theory of relativity such a geometrical defect must be in tension, and would be manifested by mass. Even though cosmic strings are thought to be extremely thin, they would have immense density, and so would represent significant gravitational wave sources. A cosmic string about a kilometer in length may be more massive than the Earth.

However general relativity predicts that the gravitational potential of a straight string vanishes: there is no gravitational force on static surrounding matter. The only gravitational effect of a straight cosmic string is a relative deflection of matter (or light) passing the string on opposite sides (a purely topological effect). A closed cosmic string gravitates in a more conventional way.

During the expansion of the universe, cosmic strings would form a network of loops, and in the past it was thought that their gravity could have been responsible for the original clumping of matter into galactic superclusters. It is now calculated that their contribution to the structure formation in the universe is less than 10%.

===Negative mass cosmic string===

The standard model of a cosmic string is a geometrical structure with an angle deficit, which thus is in tension and hence has positive mass. In 1995, Visser &quot;et al.&quot; proposed that cosmic strings could theoretically also exist with angle excesses, and thus negative tension and hence negative mass. The stability of such exotic matter strings is problematic; however, they suggested that if a negative mass string were to be wrapped around a wormhole in the early universe, such a wormhole could be stabilized sufficiently to exist in the present day.

===Super-critical cosmic string===
The exterior geometry of a (straight) cosmic string can be visualized in an embedding diagram as follows: Focusing on the two-dimensional surface perpendicular to the string, its geometry is that of a cone which is obtained by cutting out a wedge of angle δ and gluing together the edges. The angular deficit δ is linearly related to the string tension (= mass per unit length), i.e. the larger the tension, the steeper the cone. Therefore, δ reaches 2π for a certain critical value of the tension, and the cone degenerates to a cylinder. (In visualizing this setup one has to think of a string with a finite thickness.) For even larger, &quot;super-critical&quot; values, δ exceeds 2π and the (two-dimensional) exterior geometry closes up (it becomes compact), ending in a conical singularity.

However, this static geometry is unstable in the super-critical case (unlike for sub-critical tensions): Small perturbations lead to a dynamical spacetime which expands in axial direction at a constant rate. The 2D exterior is still compact, but the conical singularity can be avoided, and the embedding picture is that of a growing cigar. For even larger tensions (exceeding the critical value by approximately a factor of 1.6), the string cannot be stabilized in radial direction anymore.

Realistic cosmic strings are expected to have tensions around 6 orders of magnitude below the critical value, and are thus always sub-critical. However, the inflating cosmic string solutions might be relevant in the context of brane cosmology, where the string is promoted to a 3-brane (corresponding to our universe) in a six-dimensional bulk.

==Observational evidence==

It was once thought that the gravitational influence of cosmic strings might contribute to the large-scale clumping of matter in the universe, but all that is known today through galaxy surveys and precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fits an evolution out of random, gaussian fluctuations. These precise observations therefore tend to rule out a significant role for cosmic strings and currently it is known that the contribution of cosmic strings to the CMB cannot be more than 10%.

The violent oscillations of cosmic strings generically lead to the formation of cusps and kinks. These in turn cause parts of the string to pinch off into isolated loops. These loops have a finite lifespan and decay (primarily) via gravitational radiation. This radiation which leads to the strongest signal from cosmic strings may in turn be detectable in gravitational wave observatories. An important open question is to what extent do the pinched off loops backreact or change the initial state of the emitting cosmic string—such backreaction effects are almost always neglected in computations and are known to be important, even for order of magnitude estimates.

Gravitational lensing of a galaxy by a straight section of a cosmic string would produce two identical, undistorted images of the galaxy. In 2003 a group led by Mikhail Sazhin reported the accidental discovery of two seemingly identical galaxies very close together in the sky, leading to speculation that a cosmic string had been found. However, observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in January 2005 showed them to be a pair of similar galaxies, not two images of the same galaxy. A cosmic string would produce a similar duplicate image of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, which it was thought might have been detectable by the Planck Surveyor mission. However, a 2013 analysis of data from the Planck mission failed to find any evidence of cosmic strings.

A piece of evidence supporting cosmic string theory is a phenomenon noticed in observations of the &quot;double quasar&quot; called Q0957+561A,B. Originally discovered by Dennis Walsh, Bob Carswell, and Ray Weymann in 1979, the double image of this quasar is caused by a galaxy positioned between it and the Earth. The gravitational lens effect of this intermediate galaxy bends the quasar&#x27;s light so that it follows two paths of different lengths to Earth. The result is that we see two images of the same quasar, one arriving a short time after the other (about 417.1 days later). However, a team of astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics led by Rudolph Schild studied the quasar and found that during the period between September 1994 and July 1995 the two images appeared to have no time delay; changes in the brightness of the two images occurred simultaneously on four separate occasions. Schild and his team believe that the only explanation for this observation is that a cosmic string passed between the Earth and the quasar during that time period traveling at very high speed and oscillating with a period of about 100 days.

Until 2023 the most sensitive bounds on cosmic string parameters came from the non-detection of gravitational waves by pulsar timing array data. The first detection of gravitational waves with pulsar timing array was confirmed in 2023. The earthbound Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and especially the space-based gravitational wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will search for gravitational waves and are likely to be sensitive enough to detect signals from cosmic strings, provided the relevant cosmic string tensions are not too small.

==String theory and cosmic strings==
During the early days of string theory both string theorists and cosmic string theorists believed that there was no direct connection between superstrings and cosmic strings (the names were chosen independently by analogy with ordinary string). The possibility of cosmic strings being produced in the early universe was first envisioned by quantum field theorist Tom Kibble in 1976, and this sprouted the first flurry of interest in the field. 

In 1985, during the first superstring revolution, Edward Witten contemplated on the possibility of fundamental superstrings having been produced in the early universe and stretched to macroscopic scales, in which case (following the nomenclature of Tom Kibble) they would then be referred to as cosmic superstrings. He concluded that had they been produced they would have either disintegrated into smaller strings before ever reaching macroscopic scales (in the case of Type I superstring theory), they would always appear as boundaries of domain walls whose tension would force the strings to collapse rather than grow to cosmic scales (in the context of heterotic superstring theory), or having a characteristic energy scale close to the Planck energy they would be produced before cosmological inflation and hence be diluted away with the expansion of the universe and not be observable.

Much has changed since these early days, primarily due to the second superstring revolution. It is now known that string theory contains, in addition to the fundamental strings which define the theory perturbatively, other one-dimensional objects, such as D-strings, and higher-dimensional objects such as D-branes, NS-branes and M-branes partially wrapped on compact internal spacetime dimensions, while being spatially extended in one non-compact dimension. The possibility of large compact dimensions and large warp factors allows strings with tension much lower than the Planck scale. 

Furthermore, various dualities that have been discovered point to the conclusion that actually all these apparently different types of string are just the same object as it appears in different regions of parameter space. These new developments have largely revived interest in cosmic strings, starting in the early 2000s.

In 2002, Henry Tye and collaborators predicted the production of cosmic superstrings during the last stages of brane inflation, a string theory construction of the early universe that gives leads to an expanding universe and cosmological inflation. It was subsequently realized by string theorist Joseph Polchinski that the expanding Universe could have stretched a &quot;fundamental&quot; string (the sort which superstring theory considers) until it was of intergalactic size. Such a stretched string would exhibit many of the properties of the old &quot;cosmic&quot; string variety, making the older calculations useful again. As theorist Tom Kibble remarks, &quot;string theory cosmologists have discovered cosmic strings lurking everywhere in the undergrowth&quot;. Older proposals for detecting cosmic strings could now be used to investigate superstring theory.

Superstrings, D-strings or the other stringy objects mentioned above stretched to intergalactic scales would radiate gravitational waves, which could be detected using experiments like LIGO and especially the space-based gravitational wave experiment LISA. They might also cause slight irregularities in the cosmic microwave background, too subtle to have been detected yet but possibly within the realm of future observability.

Note that most of these proposals depend, however, on the appropriate cosmological fundamentals (strings, branes, etc.), and no convincing experimental verification of these has been confirmed to date. Cosmic strings nevertheless provide a window into string theory. If cosmic strings are observed, which is a real possibility for a wide range of cosmological string models, this would provide the first experimental evidence of a string theory model underlying the structure of spacetime.

== Cosmic string network ==
There are many attempts to detect the footprint of a cosmic strings network.

== Potential applications ==
In 1986, John G. Cramer proposed that spacecraft equipped with magnet coils could travel along cosmic strings, analogous to how a maglev train travels along a rail line.

<doc id="310405" wikidata="Q948670" url="?curid=310405" title="Mount Pulag">
<text>Mount Pulag (; ) is Luzon&#x27;s highest peak at above sea level, third-highest mountain in the Philippines, and the 26th-highest peak of an island on Earth. 

It is second-most prominent mountain in the Philippines. Located on the triple border of the provinces of Benguet, Ifugao, and Nueva Vizcaya, the borders meet at the mountain&#x27;s peak. Mount Pulag is third highest next to Mount Apo and Mount Dulang-dulang.

Mount Pulag is famous for its &quot;sea of clouds&quot; and its exceptional view of the Milky Way Galaxy at dawn, which has attracted many tourists who wish to see the &quot;other-worldly&quot; scenery. 

The entire mountain is believed to be the home to the &quot;tinmongao&quot; spirits and is the sacred resting ground of the souls of the Ibaloi people and other ethnic peoples in the area.

==History==
The Ibaloi people of Benguet mummify their dead and house them in caverns in the mountain. The Kabayan mummy burial caves, one of the main attraction of the site, are considered Philippine national cultural treasures under Presidential Decree No. 432.

Mt. Pulag was proclaimed a national park through Presidential Proclamation No. 75 signed by President Corazon Aquino on February 20, 1987, covering an area of . It is part of the Cordillera Biogeographic Zone and is a National Integrated Protected Areas Programme (NIPAP) site.

The national park is inhabited by different ethnic groups such as the Ibalois, Kalanguya, Kankana-eys, Karao, and Ifugaos.

==Geography==
Mount Pulag stands at high. The peak of the mountain is located in the Municipality of Kabayan Province of Benguet.

=== Climate ===
The climate at the summit of Mount Pulag is subpolar oceanic (Köppen &quot;Cwc&quot;), bordering a subtropical highland (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;) climate, as its summer mean temperatures only slightly exceed 10 degrees Celsius. Rainfall on the mountain averages yearly with August being the wettest month with an average rainfall of . 

Snow has not fallen on its top in at least the past 100 years, only hailstorms that look like snow. However, there have been mild flurries on the mountain, especially during December, January and February. Frost is more common on the mountain due to the low temperature during those months. 

During the winter season, the temperature at the highest point of the mountain is known to dip into sub-freezing temperatures, making it the coldest place in the country. The only recorded incidence of snow was in the late 1800s.

=== Fauna and flora ===

Mount Pulag has a large diversity of flora and fauna, including many species that endemic to the mountain. Mount Pulag hosts 528 documented plant species. It is the natural habitat of the dwarf bamboo (&quot;Yushania niitakayamensis&quot;) and the Benguet pine (&quot;Pinus kesiya&quot;) that dominate the areas of Luzon tropical pine forests found on the mountainsides. The Philippine yew tree, which contains a compound associated with cancer treatment, is found on Mount Pulag. Its bark is used by indigenous Ibaloi and Kalanguya communities to make tea.

At lower elevations, Mount Pulag has a mossy forest full of ferns, lichens, and moss.

Among its native wildlife are 33 bird species and several threatened mammals such as the Philippine deer, giant bushy-tailed cloud rat (&quot;bowet&quot;) and the long-haired fruit bat. Mount Pulag is the only place that hosts the four cloud rat species. It is one of the most biodiverse locations in the Philippines, with the newly found (since 1896) 185-grams dwarf cloud rat, &quot;Carpomys melanurus&quot;, a rare breed (endemic to the Cordillera), and the Koch pitta bird among its endangered denizens.

==Conservation efforts==
In April 2022, President Rodrigo Duterte signed a law declaring Mount Pulag as a protected landscape under the National Integrated Protected Areas System.

==Hiking activity==
As the highest mountain in Luzon, Mount Pulag attracts a lot of mountain climbers. Highlights of the climb include the montane forests and the grassland summit with its &quot;sea of clouds&quot; phenomenon. There are four major trails up the summit: the Ambangeg, Akiki, and Tawangan trails from Benguet and the Ambaguio trail from Nueva Vizcaya. These trails are managed by the Mount Pulag National Park, under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

==Incidents==

===Presidential helicopter crash===
On April 7, 2009, a Philippine Air Force (PAF) Bell 412 of the 250th Presidential Airlift Wing crashed at above sea level in the Kabayan-Pulag pass between Mount Mangingihi and Mount Pulag in thick low cloud and fog. The pilots and their passengers, who were presidential appointees, died in the crash.

===January 2018 forest fire===
On January 20, 2018, the Mount Pulag National Park temporarily suspended trekking and hiking activities on Mount Pulag following a forest fire at a section of the mountain. According to an initial investigation, the fire started when a butane gas stove brought by a hiker allegedly exploded. The fire officers in site have declared a fire extinguished later that day. 

Suits were afterwards filed against the perpetrators of the fire. Park rangers estimated that it will take at least 6 months to 1 year before the area completely recovers.

<doc id="310406" wikidata="Q377876" url="?curid=310406" title="Trouble in Tahiti">
<text>Trouble in Tahiti is a one-act opera in seven scenes composed by Leonard Bernstein with an English libretto by the composer. It is the darkest among Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;musicals&quot;, and one of only two for which he wrote the words and the music. &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot; received its first performance on 12 June 1952 at Bernstein&#x27;s Festival of the Creative Arts on the campus of Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, to an audience of nearly 3,000 people. The NBC Opera Theatre subsequently presented the opera on television in November 1952, a production which marked mezzo-soprano Beverly Wolff&#x27;s professional debut in the role of Dinah. Wolff later reprised the role in the New York City Opera&#x27;s first staging of the work in 1958. The original work is about 40 minutes long.

==Background==
Bernstein was working on the opera during his honeymoon with Felicia Montealegre. The story is based on the relationship of Bernstein&#x27;s own parents, Sam and Jennie, but the wife&#x27;s name was changed to the more singable Dinah, Bernstein&#x27;s grandmother. The work is dedicated to Marc Blitzstein; Blitzstein and Bernstein were good friends, both alumni of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. Bernstein had produced one production of Blitzstein&#x27;s &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;.

==Plot analysis==

The opera is frequently performed with minimal scenery (although Bernstein gave detailed instructions for drops and props) and very simple costumes. There are only two soloists, a married couple named Sam and Dinah. Their son, Junior, is often referred to but is never seen or heard. Other characters are addressed in certain scenes but also are never seen or heard: Sam&#x27;s client Mr Partridge (on the telephone); his friend Bill (present and interacting with Sam but intended to be invisible); his secretary Miss Brown (present but intended to be invisible); Dinah&#x27;s psychoanalyst (&quot;invisible&quot;); her milliner (&quot;imaginary&quot;).

&quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot; is the story of one day in the life of these desperately unhappy, though married people, lonely, longing for love, and unable to communicate. At the end of the opera, Sam and Dinah show a willingness to sacrifice for each other, out of commitment to the marriage, though there&#x27;s not much pleasure to be had. A copyright is held for an alternate ending by Bernstein, which has not been released.

The opera also uses a vocal trio, dance-band &quot;ensemble&quot; style (often referred to by others as a scat singing jazz trio), whose role is important. Bernstein refers to them in production notes published with the score as &quot;A Greek chorus born of the radio commercial&quot;. The trio opens the work singing the glories of Su-bur-bi-a, using the same pattern – c, f, g, c&#x27; – as in the line &quot;New York, New York&quot; from Bernstein&#x27;s (as composer) earlier musical &quot;On the Town&quot;. The sun wakens the couple, kindles their love, kisses the windows, kisses the walls, kisses the doorknob and the &quot;pretty red roof&quot;, kisses the flagstones on the front lawn, the paper at the front door, the roses around the front door of &quot;the little white house&quot; in Scarsdale (New York), Wellesley Hills (Massachusetts), Ozone Park (New York), Highland Park (Illinois), Shaker Heights (Ohio), Michigan Park (a white enclave in black Washington, D.C.), and Beverly Hills (California) – all upper-middle-class, white suburbs where people lived who had &quot;made it&quot;, who had gotten &quot;out of the hubbub&quot;. &quot;Have a good day in the city today. Joy to your labors, until you return.&quot; The viewer is about to witness a day in the life of an idyllic couple living there. &quot;Skid a lit day: skid a lit day... Ratty boo.&quot; In the middle of the opening, one member of the trio sings a stanza of nonsense, then sings it again – the same nonsense – accompanied by a solo jazz clarinet.

The trio appears several times later. In an interlude, they speak well of how possessions contribute to the &quot;wonderful life&quot;: up-to-date kitchen, washing machine, colorful bathrooms, Life magazine, Sheraton sofa, Chippendale chair, bone chinaware, real solid silver, two-door sedan and convertible coupe – &quot;Who could ask heaven for anything more?&quot; Their &quot;sweet little son&quot; seems another one of the possessions: &quot;family picture, second to none&quot;.

==Roles==

==British première==

The British Première took place on 8-12 November 1983 in Cambridge, UK, at the ADC Theatre.
A review of the performance was published in Opera Magazine in February 1984 by William Davies.

==Synopsis==

Prelude – A smiling jazz trio sings of perfect life in an affluent, unnamed suburban town, with its little white houses and happy, loving families (&quot;Mornin&#x27; Sun&quot;). The town could be anywhere; many names (such as Ozone Park and Beverly Hills) are mentioned.

Scene I – Real life in suburbia contrasts greatly with what the Trio has painted. Sam and Dinah are having breakfast, alternating between habitual bickering and lyrical moments of longing for kindness. Dinah is angry with Sam. She accuses him of having an affair with his secretary, which he denies. She also reminds Sam that their son Junior&#x27;s play is that afternoon, but Sam insists that his handball tournament at the gym is more important, to which she retorts, &quot;To hell with the gym&quot;. She needs more money to pay for her analyst, who Sam calls an &quot;out-and-out fake&quot;. Dinah says Sam should go too, which suggestion Sam pays no attention to. They agree that this is not the way to live, and they will have a conversation about their relationship problems in the evening. They both ask each other for kindness, ask the other for help &quot;to love you again&quot; and pray that the wall built up between them can be broken down. They continue to argue until Sam leaves for the office, late for his train.

Scene II – Sam, at work, exuding confidence, is dealing with business on the telephone. On the phone, he turns down entreaties from Mr. Partridge, presumably for a loan. The chorus calls him a genius and a &quot;marvelous man&quot;.

Then comes a call from &quot;Bill&quot;, who he is glad to lend money to: &quot;You&#x27;ll return it whenever you want to... Is it sufficient?&quot; Coincidentally, Bill is also participating in the handball tournament with Sam. The chorus observes that &quot;When it comes to the giving, no one touches big-hearted Sam&quot;.

Scene III – In her analyst&#x27;s office, Dinah recalls a dream about finding an imaginary garden amid a &quot;black and bare&quot; landscape, and sings about the image longingly.

Meanwhile, at Sam&#x27;s office, he asks his secretary if he ever made a pass at her. When reminded of an incident, he insists, in a menacing way, that it was an accident and that she should forget that it ever happened.

Scene IV – Sam and Dinah accidentally run into each other on the street. Rather than having lunch with each other, they both make up lies about imaginary commitments to lunch with others. They continue to sing on the stage (though not to each other), reflecting on the confusing and painful course their relationship has taken, and yearn for their lost happiness.

Interlude – Inside the house, the Trio sings of lovely life in Suburbia, detailing the possessions that contribute to the American Dream.

Scene V – At the gym, Sam has just won the handball tournament. He sings triumphantly that &quot;There&#x27;s a law about men&quot; – how some try with all their might to rise to the top, but will never win; while others, like him, are born winners and will always succeed. &quot;Men are created unequal.&quot;

Scene VI – In a hat shop, Dinah tells an unidentified person about a South Sea romance movie called &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot;, which she has just spent the afternoon watching. (Later, we learn that she has missed Junior&#x27;s play.) At first she dismisses the movie as Technicolor drivel. But as she recounts the story and its theme song &quot;Island Magic&quot;, backed by the Trio, she gets caught up in the escapist fantasy of love. Suddenly self-conscious, she stops herself, as she has to prepare dinner for Sam.

Scene VII – About to enter his home, Sam sings of another law of men – that even the winner must pay &quot;through the nose&quot; for what he gets.

The Trio sings of imaginary evenings of domestic bliss in Suburbia: &quot;bringing the loved ones together, safe by the warmth of the firelight&quot;. After dinner, Dinah is knitting and Sam is reading the paper. Sam decides the time has come for their talk, and Dinah, after asking what he wants to talk about, agrees: &quot;anything you say&quot;. Yet Sam can&#x27;t talk; he doesn&#x27;t know where to begin. He blames Dinah for interruptions, but she has not said anything. &quot;It&#x27;s no use&quot;, he says. In the only spoken dialogue in the opera, Sam asks Dinah about Junior&#x27;s play, and she admits she didn&#x27;t go either. He suggests they go to the movies, to see a new film about Tahiti; Dinah consents. (&quot;Sure, why not? Anything.&quot;) As they leave, they each long for quiet and communion, wondering if it&#x27;s possible to rediscover their love for one another. For now, they opt for the &quot;bought-and-paid-for magic&quot; of the silver screen. The Trio makes its final ironic comment, reprising the movie&#x27;s &quot;Island Magic&quot; theme song.

==Orchestral suite==
With the permission of the Leonard Bernstein Office Inc. (the musical estate of the composer), Paul Chihara adapted the operatic music into an orchestral suite. In March 2012, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra performed the New York premier of the adaptation at Carnegie Hall.

==Choral version==
With the permission of the Leonard Bernstein Office Inc., the Chinese University of Hong Kong Chorus gave a semi-staged performance of the opera with a chamber choir substituting the Trio as scored. On 17 June 2018, the chorus performed the adaptation with Garth Edwin Sunderland&#x27;s reduced orchestration in their Leonard Bernstein centennial celebration concert &quot;Bernstein in the Theater&quot; at Hong Kong City Hall Concert Hall.

==Continuation==
Bernstein wrote a continuation, &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; (1983, libretto by Stephen Wadsworth), which was poorly received. It was rewritten incorporating &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot; in the form of an extended flashback. The opera, set 30 years later, depicts the aftermath of Dinah&#x27;s death in a car crash and Sam&#x27;s struggle to reconcile with his adult children.

== On screen ==
In 1970 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation produced a television version of the opera. It was first broadcast in Sydney on ABC-TV on 19 March 1972. It starred Raymond Duparc as Sam and Marie Tysoe as Dinah.

A version with live singers performing on animated sets was broadcast on PBS in the United States in 1973, later available on VHS and DVD. Nancy Williams and Julian Patrick played the couple, with Antonia Butler, Michael Clarke and Mark Brown as the trio. Leonard Bernstein conducted.

In 2001, the BBC released a film version directed by Tom Cairns with Stephanie Novacek as Dinah and Karl Daymond as Sam.

In 2018, Opera North created a film version, based on the company&#x27;s stage production, produced by The Space and directed by Matthew Eberhardt, starring Wallis Giunta and Quirijn de Lang. The film was broadcast on Sky Arts in October 2018 and again in October 2020.

==Recordings==
&quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot; was first recorded in 1958 by the MGM Studio Orchestra under Arthur Winograd for MGM Records. It was then recorded by the composer with the Columbia Wind Ensemble and the same cast as the 1973 PBS broadcast. It was released by Columbia Masterworks in October 1974. Extracts were re-released in a &quot;Bernstein Songbook&quot; compilation CD in 1988, and the Columbia recording was re-released on CD as part of a three-disc Bernstein Theatre Works set in 1991, in the &quot;Bernstein Century&quot; series (along with &quot;Facsimile&quot;) in 1999, as part of a Bernstein retrospective 10-CD set in 2008, and finally as part of an 18-CD collection in 2017. A third recording, by the Orchestre de Picardie and Pascal Verrot was issued by Calliope Records in 2003.

Dawn Upshaw recorded &quot;What a Movie!&quot; for her 1998 album &quot;The World So Wide&quot;.

The version incorporated into &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; features in the Deutsche Grammophon live recording of that opera from 1983.

<doc id="310408" wikidata="Q7810122" url="?curid=310408" title="Style and title of the Canadian sovereign">
<text>The style and title of the Canadian sovereign is the formal mode of address of the monarch of Canada. The form is based on those that were inherited from the United Kingdom and France, used in the colonies to refer to the reigning monarch in Europe. As various Canadian territories changed ownership and then the country gradually gained independence, the style and title of the monarchs changed almost as often as the kings and queens themselves. The mode of address currently employed is a combination of a style that originates in the early 17th century and a title established by Canadian law in 2024.

==Current style and titles==

In 2023, months after the accession of King Charles III, the Canadian Parliament passed the &quot;Royal Style and Titles Act&quot;, providing for the Parliament&#x27;s consent to the issuance of a royal proclamation changing the monarch&#x27;s style and title in relation to Canada. The relevant royal proclamation was issued on 8 January 2024, and since then the sovereign&#x27;s style and titles in Canada are, in English:

And in French:

The style and titles were composed to distinctly mention Canada so as to highlight the monarch&#x27;s shared status, being both monarch of Canada and, separately, of the United Kingdom, as well as the 13 other Commonwealth realms; with emphasis showing the distinct title &quot;King of Canada&quot; as embedded in the longer formal title. When composed in 1953, this format was consistent with the monarch&#x27;s titles in her other realms. Canada removed the reference to the United Kingdom in 2024.

The monarch is typically addressed by the title &quot;King of Canada&quot; and is expected to allude to himself as King of Canada when in or acting abroad on behalf of the country. For example, Queen Elizabeth II said in 1973, &quot;it is as Queen of Canada that I am here; Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains.&quot; Since the title was adopted, the federal government has promoted its use as a signifier of Canada&#x27;s sovereign and independent status; Prime Minister John Diefenbaker said of the title in 1957, &quot;the Queen of Canada is a term which we like to use because it utterly represents her role on this occasion.&quot;
The title is also included in the Oath of Allegiance, which forms a part of the Oath of Citizenship, and can be found as on the obverse of various medals in the Canadian honours system; this wording is expected to change in light of the accession of Charles III.

Also, while the sovereign holds the nominal title &quot;head of the Commonwealth&quot;, this does not imply any political power over member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. In keeping, however, with the declaration of the prime ministers of the Commonwealth in London in 1949 of &quot;the King as the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and, as such, the Head of the Commonwealth,&quot; the title will pass to the next monarch upon the demise of the Crown and in fact did so in 1952 and 2022, though any future change is not a guaranteed certainty.

==Style of address==
The use of the styles of address &quot;Highness&quot; and &quot;Majesty&quot; originated in the United Kingdom, where they were used from the 12th century onward. During the reign of James VI and I. However, &quot;Majesty&quot; became the official style, to the exclusion of all others, and it was then brought to North America during colonial times through usage in reference to the British monarch, who then had sovereignty over the colonies on that continent. Its usage has continued since Canada became a realm in its own right in 1867 and, after a process of constitutional evolution ending with full sovereignty from the United Kingdom, is now applied to the Canadian monarch. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the sovereign is referred to in treaties and on British passports as &quot;His Britannic Majesty&quot;, the sovereign in Canada is referred to simply as &quot;His Majesty&quot; (). Still, from time to time, the style will be &quot;His Canadian Majesty&quot;, so as to differentiate from foreign sovereigns. Canadian styles of address are officially maintained by the Department of Canadian Heritage&#x27;s Protocol Office.

==History==

Following Canadian Confederation, Prime Minister of Canada John A. Macdonald, having been denied the name &quot;Kingdom of Canada&quot; for the new country, was repeatedly heard to refer to Queen Victoria as the queen of Canada and, similarly, in the lead up to the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier desired to have the words &quot;king of Canada&quot; included in the royal title by the time of the ceremony. This wish was not fulfilled, however, and Canada inherited the full British title when the country gained legislative independence from the United Kingdom in 1931.

Liberal Member of Parliament Eugène Marquis in 1945 tabled a motion in the House of Commons proposing that a change to the King&#x27;s title be a subject of discussion at the next Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference; Marquis suggested that the title include each of the King&#x27;s Dominions, giving him the designation &quot;king of Canada&quot;. But, the motion did not pass and it was only in 1948 that that form of address changed, when the Canadian Parliament passed in 1947 its own &quot;Royal Style and Titles Act&quot; and an order-in-council was issued on 22 June the following year to remove the term &quot;emperor of India&quot; from the sovereign&#x27;s Canadian title. In 1949, it was suggested by Cabinet that the King&#x27;s title be altered so that, in Canada, it would be &quot;George the Sixth, by the Grace of God, of Canada and the other nations of the British Commonwealth, King&quot;; but, again, nothing came of the proposal. At the time, Robert Gordon Robertson, then a member of the Cabinet Secretariat, opined that Canadians would not like the title &quot;King of Canada&quot;, as &quot;most Canadians [...] have not thought of themselves as citizens of either a republic or a monarchy.&quot; Still, in 1950, when William Ferdinand Alphonse Turgeon was sent to Ireland as Canada&#x27;s ambassador, the Cabinet wished to have George VI referred to in the letters of credence as &quot;King of Canada&quot;. The King&#x27;s secretaries objected strongly, claiming the monarch had only one title in law and Turgeon&#x27;s letters eventually used George&#x27;s full legal title, which referred to him as sovereign of Great Britain and &quot;Ireland&quot;.
The proclamations of Elizabeth II&#x27;s accession to the throne in February 1952 differed between Canada and the United Kingdom; in the latter, the new queen was referred to unconventionally as &quot;Queen Elizabeth II by the Grace of God, Queen of this Realm, and of Her other Realms and Territories&quot;, while the Canadian Privy Council adhered to the letter of the law, calling the sovereign &quot;Elizabeth the Second by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas Queen&quot;. The discrepancies between independent countries sharing one person as sovereign prompted discussions among the Commonwealth prime ministers before a meeting in London, England, in December 1952; Canada&#x27;s then-prime minister, Louis St. Laurent, stated that it was important a new composition for the royal title be agreed upon by all realms involved, to &quot;emphasise the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries.&quot; Canada&#x27;s preferred format was &quot;Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Canada and of Her other realms and territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;; the Canadian government preferred to keep the word &quot;queen&quot; next to &quot;Canada&quot;, as it made the sovereign&#x27;s role as monarch of Canada more clear than having &quot;queen&quot; follow several words on after the country&#x27;s name. However, as Australian ministers wished to have the United Kingdom mentioned in all the Queen&#x27;s titles, the resolution reached was a designation that included the United Kingdom as well as, for the first time, reference to Canada and the other Commonwealth realms separately. Although the Queen&#x27;s Canadian titles included &quot;defender of the faith&quot;/, neither the monarch nor any of the viceroys had an official religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (, in Latin) signifies the sovereign&#x27;s position as supreme governor of the Church of England and a member and defender of the security of the Church of Scotland, there have been no established churches in Canada since before its confederation in 1867. &quot;Defender of the faith&quot;, thus, had a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch&#x27;s belief in a higher power. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the &quot;Royal Style and Titles Act&quot; in the House of Commons:

When the &quot;Royal Style and Titles Act&quot; of 1953 was debated in the House of Commons, St. Laurent asserted on the nature of the separate and shared characteristics of the Crown, &quot;Her Majesty is now Queen of Canada but she is the Queen of Canada because she is Queen of the United Kingdom [...] It is not a separate office.&quot; The Canadian Parliament passed the act, providing for the Parliament&#x27;s consent to the issuance of a royal proclamation changing the monarch&#x27;s title being then used. The relevant royal proclamation was issued on 28 May 1953, just days before her coronation. The new legislation conferred publicly and legally the reality of a unique constitutional monarchy for Canada, thereby fulfilling the vision of the Fathers of Confederation.

The title of the Canadian sovereign was discussed intermittently through the end of the 20th and early 21st centuries, always ending up &quot;on hold&quot;. By spring of 2023, between the accession of King Charles III and his coronation, the federal Cabinet introduced a bill changing the monarch&#x27;s title by dropping the reference to the United Kingdom and the phrase &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;. Philippe Chartrand, writing in the &quot;Western Standard&quot;, said this would help &quot;clarify the distinct role of Charles III as King of Canada—constitutionally and legally independent from his role as King of the United Kingdom&quot; and &quot;part of the evolution of the Canadian Crown as a distinctly Canadian institution&quot;. The bill received royal assent on 22 June 2023, A royal proclamation of the new title was signed on 8 January 2024.

As of February 2025, Prince Edward Island continues to issue proclamations referring to the United Kingdom and to Defender of the Faith. Ontario continued this practice until late August 2024.

===The royal style and titles of Canadian sovereigns===
==Titles bestowed by Indigenous peoples==
During treaty negotiations between First Nations and agents of the British Crown in the late 1700s and early 1800s, the term &quot;Great Father&quot; came to be used to refer to King George III. This was revived as the Numbered Treaties were being formed during the latter quarter of the 19th century, when Queen Victoria was spoken of in familial terms such as &quot;the Great Queen Mother&quot; and &quot;the Great White Mother&quot;, as the Indigenous peoples understood the agreements to exist within a framework of kinship. (The informal titles, used in conjunction with the phrase &quot;Indian children&quot; for the aboriginals, were originally neither intended nor taken as an indication of Indigenous inferiority; though, they were later misinterpreted by Canadian government officials as such.) Victoria&#x27;s great-grandson, Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) was given the title &quot;Morning Star&quot; by Chief Little Thunder when he was invested as a chief of the Nakoda and Kainai nations in Banff, Alberta, in 1919.
During a lengthy meeting with the Salish peoples near Nanaimo, British Columbia, while on her royal tour of Canada in 1959, Queen Elizabeth II was granted by the Salish leaders the title &quot;Mother of All People&quot;. Elizabeth&#x27;s son, Charles III, as heir to the throne, was given a number of titles by various tribes: In 1976, the Inuit in the Northwest Territories (today Nunavut) bestowed on him the title , which loosely translates to &#x27;heir apparent&#x27;, and, the following year, the Blackfoot in Alberta bestowed upon him the title , meaning &#x27;Chief Red Crow&#x27;. Cree and Ojibway students in Manitoba named Charles &quot;Leading Star&quot; in 1986.

The Cree in Saskatchewan honoured the prince with the title , which translates as &#x27;The Sun Watches Over Him in a Good Way&#x27;. Chief Perry Bellegarde described this as echoing &quot;the language of the Numbered Treaties&quot; and to invoke &quot;one of our most important teachings. [...] Grandfather Sun watches over all of us [...] We are all related, and we all depend on each other.&quot; The title was given to Charles in 2001 by Elder, Chief, and Sun Dance leader Gordon Oakes during ceremonies in Wanuskewin Heritage Park, marking the 125th anniversary of the signing of Treaty 6.

<text>William Grey Walter (February 19, 1910 – May 6, 1977) was an American-born British neurophysiologist, cybernetician and robotician.

== Early life and education ==
Walter was born in Kansas City, Missouri, United States, on 19 February 1910, the only child of Minerva Lucrezia (Margaret) Hardy (1879–1953), an American journalist and Karl Wilhelm Walter (1880–1965), a British journalist who was working on the Kansas City &quot;Star&quot; at the time. His parents had met and married in Italy, and during the First World War the family moved to Britain. Walter&#x27;s ancestry was German/British on his father&#x27;s side, and American/British on his mother&#x27;s side. He was brought to England in 1915, educated at Westminster School with an interest in classics and science, and entered King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1928. He achieved a third class in part one (1930) and a first class in physiology in part two of the natural sciences tripos (1931).

He failed to obtain a research fellowship in Cambridge and so turned to doing basic and applied neurophysiological research in hospitals, in London, from 1935 to 1939 and then at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol, from 1939 to 1970. He also carried out research work in the United States, in the Soviet Union and in various other places in Europe. He married twice, having two sons from his first marriage, and one from the second. According to his eldest son, Nicolas Walter, &quot;he was politically on the left, a communist fellow-traveller before the Second World War and an anarchist sympathiser after it.&quot; Throughout his life he was a pioneer in the field of cybernetics. In 1970, he suffered a brain injury in a motor scooter accident. He never fully recovered and died seven years later, on May 6, 1977.

== Brain waves ==
As a young man, Walter was greatly influenced by the work of the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. He visited the lab of Hans Berger, who invented the electroencephalograph, or EEG machine, for measuring electrical activity in the brain. Walter produced his own versions of Berger&#x27;s machine with improved capabilities, which allowed it to detect a variety of brain wave types ranging from the high speed alpha waves to the slow delta waves observed during sleep.
In the 1930s, Walter made a number of discoveries using his EEG machines at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol. He was the first to determine by triangulation the surface location of the strongest alpha waves within the occipital lobe (alpha waves originate from the thalamus deep within the brain). Walter demonstrated the use of delta waves to locate brain tumours or lesions responsible for epilepsy. He developed the first brain topography machine based on EEG, using an array of spiral-scan CRTs connected to high-gain amplifiers.

During the Second World War, Walter worked on scanning radar technology and guided missiles, which may have influenced his subsequent &quot;alpha wave scanning hypothesis&quot; of brain activity.

In the 1960s, Walter also went on to discover the &quot;contingent negative variation&quot; (CNV) effect whereby a negative spike of electrical activity appears in the brain half a second prior to a person being consciously aware of movements they were about to make. Intriguingly, this effect brings into question the very notion of consciousness or free will, and should be considered as part of a person&#x27;s overall reaction time to events.

Walter&#x27;s experiments with stroboscopic light, described in &quot;The Living Brain&quot;, inspired the development of the Dreamachine by the artist Brion Gysin and technician Ian Sommerville, a device that has evolved into electronic devices known as mind machines.

== Robots ==
Grey Walter&#x27;s best-known work was his construction of some of the first electronic autonomous robots. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, which he used to call &quot;Machina speculatrix&quot; and named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as &quot;tortoises&quot; due to their shape and slow rate of movement - and because they &quot;taught us&quot; about the secrets of organisation and life. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.

In one experiment, Walter placed a light on the &quot;nose&quot; of a tortoise and watched as the robot observed itself in a mirror. &quot;It began flickering,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Twittering, and jigging like a clumsy Narcissus.&quot; Walter argued that if it were seen in an animal it &quot;might be accepted as evidence of some degree of self-awareness.&quot;

One of the tortoises was modified, (given the pretend scientific name &quot;Machina docilis&quot;) and added to its simple single celled &quot;brain&quot; one, then two conditional reflex circuits in which they could be taught simple behaviors similar to Ivan Pavlov&#x27;s dogs. This tortoise was called &quot;CORA&quot;. One of these included that being hit meant food whilst whistling means food, and when conditioned such a whistle by itself means being hit. When he added another circuit tuned to a whistle of another pitch, this could become whistle means being hit, whistle means food, and this would make the animal become &quot;afraid&quot; whenever &quot;food&quot; was presented. Walter remedied this behaviour by severing the two additional circuits, and the tortoise reverted to being a &quot;Machina speculatrix&quot;. The conditioned reflex behaviour was later placed into a static desktop model, also known as &quot;CORA&quot;.

Later versions of &quot;Machina speculatrix&quot; were exhibited at the Festival of Britain in 1951.

Walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation. His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers, including Rodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden. Modern incarnations of Walter&#x27;s &quot;turtles&quot; may be found in the form of BEAM robotics.

In 2000, an original tortoise went on display in London, UK, in the Science Museum. In 1995, this robot was also replicated by Dr. Owen Holland and Ian Horsfield of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory using some of the original parts. An original tortoise as seen at the Festival of Britain is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

Walter&#x27;s papers including his letters, photographs and press cuttings form part of the Burden archive held at the Science Museum Library &amp; Archives in Wroughton Science Museum at Wroughton.

== Private life ==

Walter married twice. His first wife was Katherine Monica Ratcliffe (1911-2012), daughter of Samuel Kerkham Ratcliffe (1868-1958), a former member of the executive of the Fabian Society. They had two sons Nicolas Hardy Walter (1934–2000) and Jeremy Walter, who became a physicist. After the couple separated in 1945, and divorced in 1946, their children were brought up by their mother Monica and her second husband Cambridge University scientist Arnold Beck.

Walter&#x27;s second wife was the radiographer Vivian Dovey (1915-1980). They married in Bristol 1947 and had one child, Timothy Walter (1949-1976) before separating in 1960, and divorcing in 1973. It has been noted that Walter and his institution gave a male biased view of their work. Vivian Dovey was a significant collaborator, yet she was depicted as a wife or assistant who cared for him.

From 1960 to 1972, Walter lived with Lorraine Josephine Aldridge (née Donn), former wife of Keith Aldridge. Vivian Dovey lived with Keith Aldridge and later took his name after her divorce.

<text>The Natural History Museum in London is a museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum&#x27;s main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road.

The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a &quot;cathedral of nature&quot;—both exemplified by the large &quot;Diplodocus&quot; cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The Natural History Museum Library contains an extensive collection of books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world.

Although commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the Geological Museum. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.

Like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee.
The museum is an exempt charity and a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The Princess of Wales is a patron of the museum. There are approximately 850 staff at the museum. The two largest strategic groups are the Public Engagement Group and Science Group.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The foundation of the collection was that of the Ulster doctor Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), who allowed his significant collections to be purchased by the British Government at a price well below their market value at the time. This purchase was funded by a lottery. Sloane&#x27;s collection, which included dried plants, and animal and human skeletons, was initially housed in Montagu House, Bloomsbury, in 1756, which was the home of the British Museum.

Most of the Sloane collection had disappeared by the early decades of the nineteenth century. Dr George Shaw (Keeper of Natural History 1806–1813) sold many specimens to the Royal College of Surgeons and had periodic &quot;cremations&quot; of material in the grounds of the museum. His successors also applied to the trustees for permission to destroy decayed specimens. In 1833, the Annual Report states that, of the 5,500 insects listed in the Sloane catalogue, none remained. The inability of the natural history departments to conserve its specimens became notorious: the Treasury refused to entrust it with specimens collected at the government&#x27;s expense. Appointments of staff were bedevilled by gentlemanly favouritism; in 1862 a nephew of the mistress of a Trustee was appointed Entomological Assistant despite not knowing the difference between a butterfly and a moth.

J. E. Gray (Keeper of Zoology 1840–1874) complained of the incidence of mental illness amongst staff: George Shaw threatened to put his foot on any shell not in the 12th edition of Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;; another had removed all the labels and registration numbers from entomological cases arranged by a rival. The huge collection of the conchologist Hugh Cuming was acquired by the museum, and Gray&#x27;s own wife had carried the open trays across the courtyard in a gale: all the labels blew away. That collection is said never to have recovered.

The Principal Librarian at the time was Antonio Panizzi; his contempt for the natural history departments and for science in general was total. The general public was not encouraged to visit the museum&#x27;s natural history exhibits. In 1835 to a Select Committee of Parliament, Sir Henry Ellis said this policy was fully approved by the Principal Librarian and his senior colleagues.

Many of these faults were corrected by the palaeontologist Richard Owen, appointed Superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum in 1856. His changes led Bill Bryson to write that &quot;by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for&quot;.

=== Planning and architecture of new building ===
Owen saw that the natural history departments needed more space, and that implied a separate building as the British Museum site was limited. Land in South Kensington was purchased, and in 1864 a competition was held to design the new museum. Only thirty-three submissions were made, many of which contained elements of the Renaissance style. The winning entry was submitted by the civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, who died shortly afterwards in December 1865. To give the project to the second-place winner would have been viewed as disrespectful to Fowke&#x27;s memory, and instead the decision was made to expand on his original plans. The scheme was taken over by Alfred Waterhouse, who was hired in February 1866, and who substantially revised the agreed plans, and designed the façades in his own idiosyncratic Romanesque style, which was inspired by his frequent visits to the Continent. The original plans included wings on either side of the main building, but these plans were soon abandoned for budgetary reasons. Initially, Waterhouse&#x27;s approximate cost was £495,000, but after further discussion was revised to £330,000. The space these would have occupied are now taken by the Earth Galleries and Darwin Centre. Waterhouse spent time with those in charge of each department of the museum to learn more about their needs, which helped him clarify his plans before construction began.
Work began in 1873 and was completed in 1880. The new museum opened on 18 April 1881, although the move from the old museum was not fully completed until 1883. The museum received both positive and negative reviews by the media upon its opening, but most viewed the museum as a positive contribution to society. In addition to routine maintenance, the building has been altered over the years, especially after it sustained damage in World War II.

Both the interiors and exteriors of the Waterhouse building make extensive use of architectural terracotta tiles to resist the sooty atmosphere of Victorian London, manufactured by the Tamworth-based company of Gibbs and Canning. The tiles and bricks feature many relief sculptures of flora and fauna, with living and extinct species featured within the west and east wings respectively. This explicit separation was at the request of Owen, and has been seen as a statement of his contemporary rebuttal of Darwin&#x27;s attempt to link present species with past through the theory of natural selection. Though Waterhouse slipped in a few anomalies, such as bats amongst the extinct animals and a fossil ammonite with the living species. The sculptures were produced from clay models by a French sculptor based in London, M Dujardin, working to drawings prepared by the architect.

The central axis of the museum is aligned with the tower of Imperial College London (formerly the Imperial Institute) and the Royal Albert Hall and Albert Memorial further north. These all form part of the complex known colloquially as Albertopolis.

=== Separation from the British Museum ===
Even after the opening, the Natural History Museum legally remained a department of the British Museum with the formal name British Museum (Natural History), usually abbreviated in the scientific literature as &quot;B.M.(N.H.)&quot;. A petition to the Chancellor of the Exchequer was made in 1866, signed by the heads of the Royal, Linnean and Zoological societies as well as naturalists including Darwin, Wallace and Huxley, asking that the museum gain independence from the board of the British Museum, and heated discussions on the matter continued for nearly one hundred years. Finally, with the passing of the British Museum Act 1963, the British Museum (Natural History) became an independent museum with its own board of trustees, although – despite a proposed amendment to the act in the House of Lords – the former name was retained. In 1989 the museum publicly re-branded itself as the Natural History Museum and stopped using the title British Museum (Natural History) on its advertising and its books for general readers. Only with the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 did the museum&#x27;s formal title finally change to the Natural History Museum.

=== Geological Museum ===
In 1985, the museum merged with the adjacent Geological Museum of the British Geological Survey, which had long competed for the limited space available in the area. The Geological Museum became world-famous for exhibitions including an active volcano model and an earthquake machine (designed by James Gardner), and housed the world&#x27;s first computer-enhanced exhibition (&quot;Treasures of the Earth&quot;). The museum&#x27;s galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as &quot;The Earth Galleries&quot;, with the other exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled &quot;The Life Galleries&quot;. The Natural History Museum&#x27;s own mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building.

The central atrium design by Neal Potter overcame visitors&#x27; reluctance to visit the upper galleries by &quot;pulling&quot; them through a model of the Earth made up of random plates on an escalator. The new design covered the walls in recycled slate and sandblasted the major stars and planets onto the wall. The museum&#x27;s &#x27;star&#x27; geological exhibits are displayed within the walls. Six iconic figures were the backdrop to discussing how previous generations have viewed Earth. These were later removed to make place for a &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; skeleton that was put on display in late 2015.

=== The Darwin Centre ===

The Darwin Centre (named after Charles Darwin) was designed as a new home for the museum&#x27;s collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, as well as new work spaces for the museum&#x27;s scientific staff and new educational visitor experiences. Built in two distinct phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most significant new development project in the museum&#x27;s history.

Phase one of the Darwin Centre opened to the public in 2002, and it houses the zoological department&#x27;s &#x27;spirit collections&#x27;—organisms preserved in alcohol. Phase Two was unveiled in September 2008 and opened to the general public in September 2009. It was designed by the Danish architecture practice C. F. Møller Architects in the shape of a giant, eight-story cocoon and houses the entomology and botanical collections—the &#x27;dry collections&#x27;. It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non-exhibited items for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily.

Arguably the most famous creature in the centre is the 8.62-metre-long giant squid, affectionately named Archie.

=== The Attenborough Studio ===
As part of the museum&#x27;s remit to communicate science education and conservation work, a new multimedia studio forms an important part of Darwin Centre Phase 2. In collaboration with the BBC&#x27;s Natural History Unit (holder of the largest archive of natural history footage) the Attenborough Studio—named after the broadcaster Sir David Attenborough—provides a multimedia environment for educational events. The studio holds regular lectures and demonstrations, including free Nature Live talks on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.
== Major specimens and exhibits ==

One of the most famous and certainly most prominent of the exhibits—nicknamed &quot;Dippy&quot;—is a -long replica of a &quot;Diplodocus carnegii&quot; skeleton which was on display for many years within the central hall. The cast was given as a gift by the Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, after a discussion with King Edward VII, then a keen trustee of the British Museum. Carnegie paid £2,000 () for the casting, copying the original held at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The pieces were sent to London in 36 crates, and on 12 May 1905, the exhibit was unveiled to great public and media interest. The real fossil had yet to be mounted, as the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh was still being constructed to house it. As word of Dippy spread, Mr Carnegie paid to have additional copies made for display in most major European capitals and in Central and South America, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The dinosaur quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot;. After 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the actual skeleton of a young blue whale, a 128-year-old skeleton nicknamed &quot;Hope&quot;. Dippy went on a tour of various British museums starting in 2018 and concluding in 2020 at Norwich Cathedral.
The blue whale skeleton, Hope, that has replaced Dippy, is another prominent display in the museum. The display of the skeleton, some long and weighing 4.5 tonnes, was only made possible in 1934 with the building of the New Whale Hall (now the Mammals (blue whale model) gallery). The whale had been in storage for 42 years since its stranding on sandbanks at the mouth of Wexford Harbour, Ireland in March 1891 after being injured by whalers. At this time, it was first displayed in the Mammals (blue whale model) gallery, but now takes pride of place in the museum&#x27;s Hintze Hall. Discussion of the idea of a life-sized model also began around 1934, and work was undertaken within the Whale Hall itself. Since taking a cast of such a large animal was deemed prohibitively expensive, scale models were used to meticulously piece the structure together. During construction, workmen left a trapdoor within the whale&#x27;s stomach, which they would use for surreptitious cigarette breaks. Before the door was closed and sealed forever, some coins and a telephone directory were placed inside—this soon growing to an urban myth that a time capsule was left inside. The work was completed—entirely within the hall and in view of the public—in 1938. At the time it was the largest such model in the world, at in length. The construction details were later borrowed by several American museums, who scaled the plans further. The work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with Hope was documented in a BBC Television special, &quot;Horizon: Dippy and the Whale&quot;, narrated by David Attenborough, which was first broadcast on BBC Two on 13 July 2017, the day before Hope was unveiled for public display.

The Darwin Centre is host to Archie, an 8.62-metre-long giant squid taken alive in a fishing net near the Falkland Islands in 2004. The squid is not on general display, but stored in the large tank room in the basement of the Phase 1 building. It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non-exhibited items behind the scenes for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily. On arrival at the museum, the specimen was immediately frozen while preparations commenced for its permanent storage. Since few complete and reasonably fresh examples of the species exist, &quot;wet storage&quot; was chosen, leaving the squid undissected. A 9.45-metre acrylic tank was constructed (by the same team that provide tanks to Damien Hirst), and the body preserved using a mixture of formalin and saline solution.

The museum holds the remains and bones of the &quot;River Thames whale&quot;, a northern bottlenose whale that lost its way on 20 January 2006 and swam into the Thames. Although primarily used for research purposes, and held at the museum&#x27;s storage site at Wandsworth.

&quot;Dinocochlea&quot;, one of the longer-standing mysteries of paleontology (originally thought to be a giant gastropod shell, then a coprolite, and now a concretion of a worm&#x27;s tunnel), has been part of the collection since its discovery in 1921.

The museum keeps a wildlife garden on its west lawn, on which a potentially new species of insect resembling &quot;Arocatus roeselii&quot; was discovered in 2007.

== Galleries ==

The museum is divided into four sets of galleries, or zones, each colour coded to follow a broad theme.

=== Red Zone ===

This is the zone that can be entered from Exhibition Road, on the East side of the building. It is a gallery themed around the changing history of the Earth.

&quot;Earth&#x27;s Treasury&quot; shows specimens of rocks, minerals and gemstones behind glass in a dimly lit gallery. &quot;Lasting Impressions&quot; is a small gallery containing specimens of rocks, plants and minerals, of which most can be touched.

== Education and research ==

The museum runs a series of educational and public engagement programmes. These include for example a highly praised &quot;How Science Works&quot; hands on workshop for school students demonstrating the use of microfossils in geological research. The museum also played a major role in securing designation of the Jurassic Coast of Devon and Dorset as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has subsequently been a lead partner in the Lyme Regis Fossil Festivals.

In 2005, the museum launched a project to develop notable gallery characters to patrol display cases, including &#x27;facsimiles&#x27; of Carl Linnaeus, Mary Anning, Dorothea Bate and William Smith. They tell stories and anecdotes of their lives and discoveries and aim to surprise visitors.

In 2010, a six-part BBC documentary series was filmed at the museum entitled &quot;Museum of Life&quot; exploring the history and behind the scenes aspects of the museum.

Since May 2001, the Natural History Museum admission has been free for some events and permanent exhibitions. However, there are certain temporary exhibits and shows that require a fee.

The Natural History museum combines the museum&#x27;s life and earth science collections with specialist expertise in &quot;taxonomy, systematics, biodiversity, natural resources, planetary science, evolution and informatics&quot; to tackle scientific questions.
In 2011, the museum led the setting up of an International Union for Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group, chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams, to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria.

== Access ==
The closest London Underground station is South Kensington — there is a tunnel from the station that emerges close to the entrances of all three museums. Admission to the museum is free, though there are donation boxes in the foyer.

Museum Lane immediately to the north provides disabled access to the museum.

A connecting bridge between the Natural History and Science museums closed to the public in the late 1990s.

== In popular culture ==

The museum plays an important role in the 1975 London-based Disney live-action feature &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot;; the eponymous skeleton is stolen from the museum, and a group of intrepid nannies hide inside the mouth of the museum&#x27;s blue whale model (in fact a specially created prop – the nannies peer out from behind the whale&#x27;s teeth, but a blue whale is a baleen whale and has no teeth). Additionally, the film is set in the 1920s, before the blue whale model was built.

The museum features as a base for Prodigium, a secret society which studies and fights monsters, first appearing on &quot;&quot;.

In the 2014 film &quot;Paddington&quot;, Millicent Clyde is a devious and treacherous taxidermist at the museum. She kidnaps Paddington, intending to kill and stuff him, but is thwarted by the Brown family after scenes involving chases inside and on the roof of the building.

The museum was prominently featured in the Sky One 2014 documentary David Attenborough&#x27;s Natural History Museum Alive where several extinct creatures exhibited at the museum including &quot;Dippy&quot; the &quot;Diplodocus&quot; were brought to life using CGI.

The museum features prominently in the level Lud&#x27;s Gate from Tomb Raider III, with Core Design launching the game with Jonathan Ross at the museum on 15 October 1998.

Andy Day&#x27;s CBeebies shows, &quot;Andy&#x27;s Dinosaur Adventures&quot; and &quot;Andy&#x27;s Prehistoric Adventures&quot; are filmed in the Natural History Museum.

The museum was site of the first Pit Stop on &quot;The Amazing Race 33&quot;.

The Museum is featured in the fifth episode of the Apple TV+ period drama &quot;The Essex Serpent&quot;.

== Natural History Museum at Tring ==

The NHM also has an outpost in Tring, Hertfordshire, built by local eccentric Lionel Walter Rothschild. The NHM took ownership in 1938. In 2007, the museum announced that the name would be changed to the Natural History Museum at Tring, though the older name, the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum, is still in widespread use.

== Move of collections to Harwell and Shinfield ==
There has been some discussion of plans to move major parts of the collections to sites in Harwell (which was abandoned) and then to Shinfield, Berkshire. These plans have been heavily criticized, together with the overall departure of the strategic direction of the museum.

<text>Silas Comfort Swallow (March 5, 1839 – August 13, 1930) was a United States Methodist preacher and prohibitionist politician who was a lifelong opponent of slavery. He was the Prohibitionist presidential nominee in 1904.

==Early life==
On March 5, 1839, Silas Comfort Swallow was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to George Swallow, a trustee of Wyoming Seminary, and Sarah Thompson. He was named after Methodist preacher &quot;Silas Comfort&quot; (1803–1868), an anti-slavery member of the Genesee, Oneida and Missouri Conferences.

While serving in St. Louis, Missouri, Swallow admitted as evidence in a church trial the testimony of a Negro, a practice which was forbidden in public trials in Missouri at the time. He was censured by his Conference, but that censure was overturned by the 1840 General Conference. The General Conference then bowed to Southern pressure and passed a resolution prohibiting the testimony of Negroes in church trials within states that forbade such testimony in public trials. That resolution was rescinded in 1844. Before entering the ministry, Silas was employed as a school teacher from the age of 16 to 21 and later studied law.

==Career==

In 1862, he enlisted into the Union Army and served as a First lieutenant in the 18th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War.

He entered the Baltimore Conference in 1863 and became a charter member of the Central Pennsylvania Conference upon its organization in 1869. On January 20, 1866, he married Rebecca Louise Robins. He worked a church builder, presiding elder, and editor of &quot;The Central Pennsylvania Methodist&quot;. As editor he attacked alcohol, spiritual indifference, and political corruption in the state government that led to him being prosecuted and convicted of slander and fined $500 (~$ in ) in 1897, but the verdict was later reversed by the State Superior Court. In 1901 he was criticized for a recent editorial critical of William McKinley that was released shortly after his death.
===Politics===

He was the Prohibition Party&#x27;s candidate for Mayor of Harrisburg, state legislature, State Treasurer, and Governor of Pennsylvania. When he ran for governor of Pennsylvania in 1898 he received the nomination of the Prohibition, People&#x27;s, Liberty, and Honest Government parties and received 13% in the general election. In 1901, he received a single vote for Senator from state representative L. D. Brown.

During the 1900 presidential election he ran for the Prohibition Party&#x27;s presidential nomination, but was narrowly defeated by John G. Woolley after Hale Johnson withdrew before balloting and endorsed Woolley. During the 1904 presidential election it was initially believed that General Nelson A. Miles would be the Prohibition Party&#x27;s presidential nominee, but one hour before the convention was to vote he sent a telegram refusing to allow the delegates to vote for him. Swallow, who was supposed to serve as an at-large delegate for Pennsylvania, but was unable to attend due to his wife&#x27;s poor health, was voted on instead and given the nomination by acclamation. It was speculated that he might not accept the nomination, but after his wife&#x27;s health improved he accepted it and appeared on the ticket with his running mate George Washington Carroll. In the general election he received 259,102 votes which is the second highest popular vote total for the party.

==Death==

Swallow died at his home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on August 13, 1930, from old age and was interred at Paxtang Cemetery near Harrisburg.

==Church service==
Dr. Swallow&#x27;s official conference service record lists the following appointments:
*1863–1864 Milton circuit.
*1864–1866 Berwick.
*1866–1868 Catawissa.
*1868–1871 Newberry.
*1871–1873 Williamsport Third Street.
*1873–1875 Milton.
*1875–1877 Altoona Eighth Avenue.
*1877–1881 presiding elder, Altoona District.
*1881–1884 York First.
*1884–1886 Williamsport Grace.
*1886–1887 agent, Dickinson College.
*1887–1892 Harrisburg Ridge Avenue.
*1892–1902 superintendent, Harrisburg Methodist book room.
*1902–1908 no appointment, by request.
*1908–1930 retired.

==Writings==
Being an editor, Swallow made certain that his life story was recorded for posterity. Upon reaching his 70th birthday in 1909, he published a 482-page hardback autobiography: &quot;III Score and X – Selections, Collections, Recollections of Seventy Busy Years&quot;.

This proved to be so successful that he came out with periodic updates as follows:
*&quot;Toasts and Roasts of III Score and X&quot;, 1911.
*&quot;Then and Now – Some Reminiscences of an Octogenarian&quot;, 1919.
*&quot;IV Score and More&quot;, 1922.

Other booklets and pamphlets by Swallow, all of which are preserved in the archives of the Central Pennsylvania Conference of the United Methodist Church, range in date and content from his 1879 &quot;Camp Meetings and the Sabbath&quot; to his 1917 &quot;A Sermon on Thanksgiving and Thanksliving&quot;.

<text>Arthur Stewart Farmer (August 21, 1928 – October 4, 1999) was an American jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player. He also played flumpet, a trumpet–flugelhorn combination especially designed for him. He and his identical twin brother, double bassist Addison Farmer, started playing professionally while at high school in Los Angeles. Art gained greater attention after the release of a recording of his composition &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Market&quot; in 1952. He subsequently moved from Los Angeles to New York, where he performed and recorded with musicians such as Horace Silver, Sonny Rollins, and Gigi Gryce and became known principally as a bebop player.

As Farmer&#x27;s reputation grew, he expanded from bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He went on to join Gerry Mulligan&#x27;s quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist&#x27;s instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing is known for its individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth of tone and sensitivity.

==Early life==

Art Farmer was born an hour before his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, reportedly at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four years old, and their steelworker father was killed in a work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona, when he was still four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of 13. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art&#x27;s grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer&#x27;s first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer&#x27;s instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer&#x27;s school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.

Farmer and his brother moved to Los Angeles in 1945, attending the music-oriented Jefferson High School, where they got music instruction and met other developing musicians such as Sonny Criss, Ernie Andrews, Big Jay McNeely, and Ed Thigpen. The brothers earned money by working in a cold-storage warehouse
and by playing professionally. Art started playing trumpet professionally at the age of 16, performing in the bands of Horace Henderson, Jimmy Mundy, and Floyd Ray, among others. These opportunities came about through a combination of his ability and the absence of numerous older musicians, who were still in the armed forces following World War II. Around this time in Los Angeles, there were abundant opportunities for musical development, according to Farmer: &quot;During the day you would go to somebody&#x27;s house and play. At night there were after-hours clubs [...and] anybody who wanted to play was free to come up and play&quot;. Farmer left high school early but persuaded the principal to give him a diploma, which he did not collect until a visit to the school in 1958.

At this time, as an adolescent in Los Angeles, bebop and the swing era big bands both attracted Farmer&#x27;s attention. Decades later, he stated that, at that time, &quot;I knew I had to be in jazz. Two things decided me – the sound of a trumpet section in a big band and hearing a jam session&quot;. Farmer&#x27;s trumpet influences in the 1940s were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, but, in his own words, &quot;then I heard Freddie Webster, and I loved his sound. I decided to work on sound because it seemed like most of the guys my age were just working on speed&quot;.

==Later life and career==

===Early career in Los Angeles and New York===

Farmer left school to tour with a group led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer&#x27;s lip gave out. Performing for long periods seven days a week for this job put great pressure on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann&#x27;s band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The hazards of the touring jazz musician&#x27;s lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.

Farmer&#x27;s first studio recording appears to have been on June 28 or July 2, 1948, in Los Angeles, under the leadership of vocalist Big Joe Turner and pianist Pete Johnson. They recorded &quot;Radar Blues&quot;, and at some point in the same or the following year they added a further seven sides; the eight tracks were released as four singles by Swing Time Records. Farmer recorded further singles with Roy Porter and then, on January 21, 1952, as a member of Wardell Gray&#x27;s sextet. The latter session produced six tracks that were released as singles. These included &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Market&quot;, a piece that was written by Farmer and brought him greater attention.

===Career after second move to New York===

Farmer worked in Los Angeles for a time as a hotel janitor and a hospital file clerk, before joining Lionel Hampton&#x27;s orchestra in 1952. He toured Europe with the orchestra from September to December 1953, and shared the organization&#x27;s trumpet chairs with Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones and Benny Bailey. This aided his musical development considerably, as did his 1953 membership of Teddy Charles&#x27; New Directions band – the compositions he encountered in this band allowed him to consider a broader range of expression during improvisation.

Farmer relocated to New York and, on July 2, 1953, had his first recording session as leader. This was combined with another recorded 11 months later to form the eight-track Prestige LP, &quot;The Art Farmer Septet&quot;, featuring arrangements by Quincy Jones and Gigi Gryce. Farmer became &quot;one of the most sought-after trumpeters of the fifties&quot;: he continued to work with Gryce (1954–56), and also with Horace Silver (1956–58) and Gerry Mulligan (1958–59), among others. One of the others was pianist Thelonious Monk, who led a sextet that included Farmer on its performances on a version of the Steve Allen Show, broadcast on television on June 10, 1955. The following month, Farmer played in the Charles Mingus sextet&#x27;s performance at the Newport Jazz Festival.

Farmer recorded only twice with Horace Silver&#x27;s group, as Silver recorded for Blue Note Records, while Farmer was signed to Prestige. Feuds between the label bosses ruled out extensive cross-label collaboration. The transition from Silver&#x27;s piano-led quintet to Mulligan&#x27;s piano-less quartet was not straightforward: &quot;to suddenly find yourself in a pianoless group was like walking down the street naked&quot;, commented Farmer. As a member of Mulligan&#x27;s band, Farmer appeared on film twice – in &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; (1960) – and again toured Europe, as part of a Jazz at the Philharmonic tour, helping him to develop an international reputation. In New York, Farmer worked with Lester Young, who told him to &quot;tighten up and tell a &#x27;story&#x27; in each solo&quot;. At this time, Farmer also rented his trumpet on a nightly basis to Miles Davis, who had pawned his own due to his drug dependency.

From the middle of the 1950s, Farmer featured in recordings by leading arrangers of the day, including George Russell, Quincy Jones and Oliver Nelson, being in demand because of his reputation for being able to play anything. The wide range of styles these arrangers represented was extended when Farmer took part in a series of experimental sessions with composer Edgard Varèse in 1957. Varèse used approximate notation and wanted the musicians to improvise within its structure; at least some of the seasoned jazz musicians present regarded this process of creation as similar to their own familiar creations of spontaneously produced head arrangements, but their efforts influenced Varèse&#x27;s composition, Poème électronique. Farmer&#x27;s playing around this time is summarized by critic Whitney Balliett, commenting on his performance on Hal McKusick&#x27;s 1957 album &quot;Hal McKusick Quintet&quot;: &quot;Farmer has become one of the few genuinely individual modern trumpeters. (Nine out of ten modern trumpeters are true copies of Dizzy Gillespie or Miles Davis.)&quot; Farmer was one of 57 jazz musicians to appear in the 1958 photograph &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot; and was later interviewed for the 1994 documentary of the same title.

Farmer formed the Jazztet in 1959, with the composer and tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, after each man independently came to the conclusion that the other should be a member of his new sextet. The Jazztet lasted until 1962, recorded several albums for Argo and Mercury Records, and assisted in the early careers of pianist McCoy Tyner and trombonist Grachan Moncur III. In the early 1960s Farmer established a trio with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Steve Swallow; his relationship with Hall lasted from 1962 to 1964, and included two tours of Europe, one of which had concerts recorded for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Jazz 625&quot; programme, which were later released on DVD. Hall left the second tour while the quartet, which included Swallow and drummer Pete La Roca, was engaged in Berlin, and a pianist replaced him; this was ultimately Steve Kuhn. In 1964, this new quartet recorded the album &quot;Sing Me Softly of the Blues&quot; for the Atlantic label. These bands played laid back, melodious music during a period when avant-garde jazz was becoming more common.

Farmer toured Europe in 1965–66, then returned to the US and led a small group with Jimmy Heath. His stylistic development continued during this period of his career, in part because he &quot;absorbed, understood, and had the technical and artistic gifts to put to personal use the [John] Coltrane innovations of the &#x27;Giant Steps&#x27; period of the early 1960s&quot;. Work opportunities, however, were diminishing as rock became more popular in the mid-1960s, so Farmer joined the pit orchestra of Elliot Lawrence for the production of &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; on Broadway, for six months.

===Career after permanent move to Europe===

The visits to Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and ultimately settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band and joined the Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so he was able to play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra&#x27;s music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer&#x27;s time, he found that it was getting in the way of his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976: &quot;I&#x27;m traveling 90 percent of the time. I can live anywhere. It&#x27;s just a matter of getting to the airport&quot;. A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking a couple of years before that; Farmer &quot;used to think he couldn&#x27;t play without drinking; now he couldn&#x27;t play and drink&quot;, was the interviewer&#x27;s summary of Farmer&#x27;s habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.

From the early 1990s, Farmer had a second house in New York and divided his time between Vienna and there. He had regular gigs with Clifford Jordan at the Sweet Basil Jazz Club and, later, with Ran Blake and Jerome Richardson at the Village Vanguard, both in New York. Farmer was awarded the Austrian Gold Medal of Merit in 1994. In the same year, a concert in honor of his achievements was held at the Alice Tully Hall in New York. Farmer also recorded extensively as a leader throughout his later career, including some pieces of classical music with US and European orchestras. Farmer&#x27;s level of playing even towards the end of his career was noted in a review by Scott Yanow of one of his last recordings, &quot;Silk Road&quot;, from 1996: &quot;the warm-toned and swinging Farmer is consistently the main star, and at age 68 he proves to still be in his prime&quot;. In 1999 Farmer was selected as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master. A few months later, on October 4, Farmer died of a heart attack at home in Manhattan, aged 71.

==Personality and family life==
Farmer first married in the mid-1950s, to a woman from South America. They divorced after about a year, but the marriage produced one son, Arthur Jr, who died in 1994. Farmer&#x27;s second wife was a distant cousin; this marriage also ended in divorce. He married again, to a Viennese banker named Mechtilde Lawugger, and their son, Georg, was born in the early 1970s. They lived together in a house that they had built in Vienna, and Farmer reported contentment with his lifestyle; notably, in contrast with his homeland, he did not experience racism in Europe. Farmer described himself in 1985 as &quot;an introvert, and kind of reclusive&quot;; a soundproof room in his Austrian house allowed him to practice alone for the four or five hours a day that he desired. His personality was often described by others as mirroring his playing: Leonard Feather, for instance, observed in 1990 that Farmer was &quot;mellow, relaxed and [...] gentle&quot;.

Farmer was affected by the sudden death of his twin brother in 1963: more than 20 years later, he said that he still dreamed of his sibling, and admitted that, &quot;It seems there&#x27;s a part of him I haven&#x27;t fully gotten over&quot;. Farmer&#x27;s third wife died from cancer in 1992; speaking three years later, he remarked that &quot;I guess I never will really recover from that because we had been together for over 20 years when she died&quot;. After his own death, he was described as being survived by his companion and manager, Lynne Mueller, and son.

==Playing style==
Descriptions of Farmer&#x27;s playing style typically stress his lyricism and the warmth of his sound. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; obituary writers noted that his playing had &quot;a sweetly lyrical tone and a melodic approach to phrasing, neither of which minimized his capacity to produce rhythmically swinging phrases&quot;. The equivalent comments in &quot;The Guardian&quot; were that &quot;Farmer avoided the bright, penetrating sound of orthodox trumpet playing and was influenced by the more reserved articulation of Miles Davis and Kenny Dorham&quot;, and that, although he could seem more restrained than Davis or Lee Morgan, &quot;Farmer was in his way a true original. His phrasing was always distinctive, letting the beat run ahead of him rather in the manner of Billie Holiday&#x27;s vocals&quot;.

Farmer moved from trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn from the early 1960s, utilising the latter instrument&#x27;s more mellow sound and Farmer&#x27;s ability to get what he wanted from it without having to use a mute. In 1989, he played a major part in creating a trumpet–flugelhorn hybrid, the flumpet, which was constructed for him by instrument maker David Monette. This instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a range of settings, from small groups to big bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with a personalized flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer&#x27;s life.

Farmer&#x27;s determination to keep exploring forms of expression continued throughout his life. One comment on a concert given when Farmer was 67 was that &quot;his style was continuing to evolve&quot;; he &quot;delivered several solos in which his characteristically flowing lines were interrupted by sudden, wide melodic leaps and disjunct rhythmic accents&quot;. A few months before his death, although faster numbers had become perhaps too challenging, &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed, Farmer&#x27;s playing on slower tunes achieved a new level of emotional expression.

<text>The University of Sheffield (informally Sheffield University or TUOS) is a public research university in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. Its history traces back to the foundation of Sheffield Medical School in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and Sheffield Technical School in 1884. University College of Sheffield was subsequently formed by the amalgamation of the three institutions in 1897 and was granted a royal charter as University of Sheffield in 1905 by King Edward VII.

Sheffield is formed from 50 academic departments which are organised into five faculties and an international faculty. The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £887.9 million, of which £185.8 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £651.4 million. Sheffield is regarded as one of the top engineering universities in Europe. As of the latest HESA statistics, it had the highest engineering research income and expenditure among all the universities in the UK for two consecutive years.

The university is one of the original red brick universities and a founding member of the Russell Group. It is also part of the Worldwide Universities Network, the N8 Group of the eight most research intensive universities in Northern England and the White Rose University Consortium. Sheffield has been ranked in between 66th and 105th best university in the world by QS for the last fifteen years. The THE ranked the university 22nd in Europe for teaching excellence in 2020. According to the latest Research Excellence Framework 2021, Sheffield is ranked 11th in the UK for research power calculated by multiplying the institution&#x27;s GPA by the total number of full-time equivalent staff submitted.

There are six Nobel laureates affiliated with Sheffield, as either the alumni or former long-term staff of the university. They are contributors to the development of penicillin, the discovery of the citric acid cycle, the investigation of high-speed chemical reactions, the discovery of introns in eukaryotic DNA, the discovery of fullerene, and the development of molecular machines. Alumni also include several heads of state, Home Secretaries, Court of Appeal judges, Booker Prize winners, astronauts and Olympic gold medallists.

==History==
===Origins===
The University of Sheffield was originally formed by the merger of three local institutions: the Sheffield School of Medicine, Firth College, and the Sheffield Technical School. With a history dating back to as early as the 1810s, the Sheffield School of Medicine is the university&#x27;s oldest predecessor institution, which is also the oldest higher education establishment in Sheffield. In 1795, the General Infirmary was opened, becoming the first hospital in the city. Because of the apprenticeship-type training, the medical education at that time was largely unstructured. Regarded as the father of Sheffield&#x27;s medical education, surgeon apothecary Hall Overend began to train medical students in 1811. His school of anatomy and medicine was externally recognised in 1828, and he conducted and taught human dissection in an anatomy museum at his home in Church Street. Overend, however, was not officially registered as a lecturer with the Society of Apothecaries, a recognised body for medical education. Physicians and surgeons of the General Infirmary suggested that a school associated with the hospital would be highly eligible for recognition by the society. As a result, in 1828, a public meeting was called by physician Sir Arnold Knight, and supported by Overend, to establish a new medical school. The Sheffield Medical Institution was formally opened a year later in 1829 on Surrey Street, with the Latin motto &quot;Ars longa vita brevis&quot; (Art is long, life is short), which refers to the difficulty to acquire and practice the art of Medicine. Knight laid the foundation stone and delivered the opening lecture.

The University Extension Movement emerged in the 1870s with the aim of providing education in the city which lacked any tertiary institutions. During the period, the steel industry in Sheffield was prospering and the city&#x27;s population was doubled to around 240,000 from the 1840s. In 1871, the university extension scheme arrived in Sheffield, and a group of lecturers from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge travelled to the city giving lectures and educating people about the benefits of tertiary education. Steel manufacturer and former mayor of Sheffield Mark Firth and clergyman Samuel Earnshaw therefore organised courses in English literature and political economy. The courses became popular so Firth decided to donate £20,000 and purchase a site in the city centre (now Leopold Street and West Street) in 1877 to build a new institution for the classes. Firth College was founded during Firth&#x27;s late year in 1879 and developed out of the Extension Movement scheme to teach arts and pure science subjects. The college saved the medical school, which had an insecure early history, from collapse and took over the teaching of all background subjects to medical students. In 1888 the medical school was relocated, opposite Firth College, to a new building on Leopold Street.

Firth College also helped to fund the opening of the Sheffield Technical School in 1884 to teach applied science, the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover. The Sheffield Technical School was created by collecting funds within Firth College because of local concern about the need for technical training, particularly steelmaking in Sheffield. Former mayor of Sheffield Sir Frederick Mappin started to fundraise for the school and £10,240 was raised. A grant was secured in 1883 to fund a professor of Metallurgy and Mechanical Engineering. Many of the steel-making firms in Sheffield contributed to funding the Technical School, and research from the school in turn helped develop new processes and products for the companies. The Technical School was originally founded as a new technical department in Firth College, and in 1886, the school moved to St George&#x27;s Square (later renamed Charlotte Street and now Mappin Street) on the site of the old Grammar School. William Ripper was appointed as Head of Mechanical Engineering at Firth College from 1889, then Principal of Sheffield Technical School.
===Foundation===
Sheffield was at that time the only large city in England without a university. William Mitchinson Hicks, who was Principal of Firth College from 1892 to 1897, had an ambition to establish a university in the city. As a first stage of his ideal, Hicks was devoted to the union of the three higher education institutions in Sheffield and to transform Firth College into a university college. He also extended the college by creating new departments and adding new buildings. In 1897, Firth College merged with the Medical School and the Technical School to form the University College of Sheffield, and Hicks served as its first principal. Six years since the foundation of the university college, on 18 May 1903, the resolution to apply for a royal charter was passed. The university college started to develop its estate soon after: Western House by Weston Park on Western Bank was bought and demolished in 1903 for building a new university property. A building with a traditional collegiate quadrangle (later known as Western Bank building and now Firth Court) was planned on the site. Sir Frederick Mappin later successfully sought financial support from the Sheffield City Council and appealed for public donations. In 1904, steelworkers, coal miners, factory workers and the people of Sheffield donated over £50,000 via penny donations to help found the University of Sheffield.It was originally envisaged that the university college would join Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds as the fourth member of the federal Victoria University. The new university was proposed to be named &quot;Victoria University of Yorkshire&quot; by Leeds but was rejected by the Privy Council. The Victoria University, however, began to split up as independent universities before this could happen, when Liverpool gained a charter of its own in 1903. Rather than joining a Yorkshire university with Leeds, the University College of Sheffield was driven by civic pride to pursue independent university status, to bring higher education, give support to industries and serve as a centre for disease study. Hicks also advocated the independent degree awarding power would attract talented staff. The University College of Sheffield&#x27;s charter was sealed on 31 May 1905 and became the University of Sheffield. On 12 July 1905, Firth Court on Western Bank was opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. St George&#x27;s Square remained the centre of departments of Applied Science, and the departments of Arts, Medicine and Science moved to Western Bank. Sheffield is one of the six pre-World War One red brick universities, the civic universities founded in the major industrial cities of England.

===20th century===
In 1905, when the university first opened, there were 363 students and 114 of them were enrolled full-time. Sheffield at the time had 71 members of staff. By then, the first Hall of Residence (Stephenson Hall) and library (Edgar Allen library) had been established. The number of students increased to a short-lived peak of 1,000 in 1919 when returning ex-servicemen were admitted to the university. During the First World War, some of the academic subjects and courses were replaced by teaching of munitions making and medical appliances production. The university has expanded since the 1920s from two ends on Western Bank and on the St George&#x27;s site. The number of full-time students was stabilized at about 750 between the two world wars. In 1943, the University Grants Committee announced that universities in the UK should look forward to expansion in the years after the Second World War. Sheffield predicted a 50% increase in student population but the university was unprepared for such growth. There was pressure on the university to expand since the student numbers had increased from around 1,000 to 3,000 by 1946. The university announced proposals for development in 1947, which emphasised the need for new departments, medical school, library, administration building, halls of residence, as well as the completion of the Western Bank quadrangle and the extension of the Students&#x27; Union.

The university then grew slowly until the 1950s and 1960s when it began to expand rapidly. Many new buildings (including the Main Library and the Arts Tower) were built and older houses were brought into academic use. Student numbers increased to their present levels of just under 26,000. At the same time in the 1950s, the university was expanding at other sites, including the St Georges area. From the 1960s, many more buildings have been constructed or extended, including the Union of Students and St George&#x27;s Library. The campus master plan proposed in the 1940s was completed by the 1970s, and the university required a new development plan.

The 1980s saw the opening of many new buildings and centres, such as the multi-purpose Octagon Centre and the Sir Henry Stephenson Building. The university&#x27;s teaching hospital, Northern General Hospital, was also extended. In 1987 the university began to collaborate with its once would-be partners of the Victoria University by co-founding the Northern Consortium; a coalition for the education and recruitment of international students. The university continued to expand in the 1990s. New premises were opened for School of the Clinical Dentistry, the Division of Education, and the Management School. In 1995, the university took over the Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, forming a new School of Nursing and Midwifery. The St George&#x27;s Hospital was extended and a new building at the Northern General Hospital has been constructed, which greatly increased the size of the medical faculty.

Hans Adolf Krebs was appointed as lecturer in pharmacology in 1935. At Sheffield Krebs and his postgraduate student discovered the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) in 1937, which earned him a Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology for 1953. In 1938, the university opened the Department of Biochemistry (renamed since the 1990s as the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology) and Krebs became its first Head. Krebs Institute, a research centre for mechanistic biology, was founded in 1988 within the Department of Biochemistry. George Porter joined the university as Professor of Physical Chemistry in 1955 and he further developed his later Nobel Prize-winning work flash photolysis at Sheffield. Porter was appointed Firth Professor of Chemistry and became Head of the Department of Chemistry in 1963.

===21st century===

In the 21st century, the university opened many more major buildings in the area immediately to the east and west of Upper Hanover Street, such as the Jessop Building, the Soundhouse, Jessop West and the Information Commons. The Arts Tower building, the Students&#x27; Union and University House buildings, the Sheffield Bioincubator and University Health Centre were also refurbished. A new campus, North Campus, was opened. In 2003, a development framework was produced by Turnberry Consulting, with proposals aimed to densify the campus. In 2005, the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority announced that it would split the training between Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University – however, the university decided to pull out of providing preregistration nursing and midwifery training due to &quot;costs and operational difficulties&quot;. On 28 September 2015, a new six-storey building, the Diamond, was opened.

In February 2016, the university started to work with Sheffield City Council to transform public spaces around the campus. The £8 million project includes building and improving pedestrianisation, crossings, cycle routes, as well as greening the campus. The university intended to expand the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and provision for apprenticeships; however, while the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership recommended that the £10 million funding bid should be approved, the university withdrew the bid in November 2018. The University Concourse was refurbished in 2019 to replace the 50-year-old paving and walls. Major development projects in the 2020s include constructions of a new Information School building (Northumberland Road Building), Social Sciences Building, Royce Discovery Centre, energy centre (the Transformer), Translational Energy Research Centre, and redevelopment of the original Henderson&#x27;s factory.

==Campus and locations==
The University of Sheffield is not a campus university, though most of its 430 buildings are located in fairly close proximity to each other. It is divided geographically by the Sheffield Inner Ring Road. The Upper Hanover Street section of the ring road splits university buildings into the Western Bank and the St George&#x27;s campus areas. 
Instead of growing from a single centre, since receiving its royal charter, the university has expanded from two academic foci about 1 km apart: Firth Court on Western Bank and Sir Frederick Mappin Building on St George&#x27;s. The two foci started to fuse in the 1960s, as more buildings have been constructed or acquired by the university. The completion of the Information Commons and Jessop West buildings, in the late 2000s, bridges both west (Western Bank) and east (St George&#x27;s) campus, and in 2017, a new pedestrian crossing was installed on the Upper Hanover Street, physically connecting the two campus.

The university campus is composed of an eclectic range of buildings from Victorian style to modernism to contemporary. Sir Frederick Mappin Building and Central Block are two Victorian university buildings, now linked by a contemporary curved glass roof constructed in 2020. Opened as the Western Bank Building, Firth Court is a red brick Edwardian building in Perpendicular Revival style, and is connected to the 1971 modernist Alfred Denny Building. The nearby Arts Tower is also an example of postwar modernist building in the International Style. The Diamond, a contemporary architecture designed by Twelve Architects, is situated next to the Victorian Jessop Building on the former site of Jessop&#x27;s Edwardian wing.

A total of 36 university estate are listed. Of these, the Arts Tower and Western Bank Library are Grade II* listed buildings. Firth Court, Mappin Building, St George&#x27;s Church, Jessop Building and the Drama Studio are listed Grade II.

===Main (Western Bank) Campus===
The centre of the university&#x27;s presence lies one mile to the west of Sheffield city centre, where there is a mile-long collection of buildings belonging almost entirely to the university. This main campus area is bounded by Upper Hanover Street to the east, Glossop Road to the south, Clarkson Street to the west, and Bolsover Street to the north. Western Bank (A57) runs through the campus. The area to the north of Western Bank includes Firth Court, Alfred Denny Building, Western Bank Library and Arts Tower, Geography and Planning building, Bartolomé House, and Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings. Within the southern area of the campus are the Sheffield Students&#x27; Union, the Octagon Centre, Graves Building and Hicks Building. A concourse under the A57 flyover connects Alfred Denny Building on the north side and Students&#x27; Union on the south. Until the completion of three pedestrian crossings on Western Bank in 2017, the concourse underpass was the only link that allowed students to easily move between buildings in this cluster. The Information Commons, a library and computing centre opened in 2007, is also located at the Western Bank Campus on Leavygreave Road. In addition, throughout 2010 the Western Bank Library received a £3.3 million restoration and refurbishment, the University of Sheffield Union of Students underwent a £5 million rebuild, and work commenced on a multimillion-pound refurbishment of the Grade II* listed Arts Tower to extend its lifespan by 30 years.

===St George&#x27;s Campus===
To the east of the main campus lies St George&#x27;s campus, named after St George&#x27;s Church (now a lecture theatre and postgraduate residence). The campus is the historical location of the Sheffield Technical School. It is bounded by Upper Hanover Street to the west, Broad Lane to the north, Rockingham Street to the east, and West Street to the south, and is part of St George&#x27;s Quarter, one of the seven official Sheffield city centre quarters. Also known as the Engineering campus, St George&#x27;s campus is centred on Mappin Street, the location of the Faculty of Engineering (partly housed in the Grade II-listed Mappin Building) and the Department of Journalism Studies, Department of Economics and Department of Computer Science. The university also maintains the Turner Museum of Glass in this area. As part of the 2000s development plan, the university has converted the listed Victorian Jessop Hospital for Women into the new home of the Department of Music in 2009. The formerly Grade II-listed Edwardian wing of the Jessop Hospital was demolished after Sheffield City Council&#x27;s planning committee voted for approval. The building was replaced by a new £81 million building for the Faculty of Engineering which opened in September 2015, named the Diamond. It is a purpose-built multi-disciplinary building that houses lecture theatres, laboratories, workrooms and other facilities for the teaching of engineering. Amongst the more recent additions to the university&#x27;s estate located on this campus are the Soundhouse (2008; a music practice and studio facility) and the Jessop West building (2009; the first UK project by Berlin architects Sauerbruch Hutton).The Sir Frederick Mappin Building is a Grade II-listed building in an area known as the St George&#x27;s Complex. The building houses much of the Faculty of Engineering and St George&#x27;s IT centre. Completed in 1885, the oldest part of the building, the former Sheffield Technical School, now the Central Wing, lies in the centre of the building. The extensive Mappin Street frontage includes the main entrance, the John Carr Library and Mappin Hall, and is connected to the Central Wing by a bridge. In early 2020, the Mappin Building and the Central Wing were refurbished. As a result of the refurbishments, the two buildings are joined by a quadruple-height atrium with curved glass roof. The atrium, called the Engineering Heartspace, houses laboratories, offices and social spaces.

Given its name to the campus, St George&#x27;s Church was the first of three commissioners&#x27; churches to be built in Sheffield under the Church Building Act 1818. It was built in the Perpendicular style. The church closed in 1981 and was acquired by the university. It was converted for use as a lecture theatre in 1994, while the upstairs has been converted for use as student accommodation.

===Other sites===
Further west lies Weston Park, the Weston Park Museum, the Harold Cantor Gallery, university&#x27;s sports facilities Goodwin Sports Centre in the Crookesmoor area, and the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health around the Royal Hallamshire Hospital (although these subjects are taught in the city&#x27;s extensive teaching hospitals under the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and throughout South Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire). It is in this area that the new £12 million Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 2010, is located. There is a cluster of buildings located to the north of Broad Lane, opposite St George&#x27;s campus, collectively called the north campus. Kroto Research Institute, Kroto Innovation Centre, Nanoscience and Technology Building, Graduate Research Centre, George Porter Building and the International College are based on this campus area. To the south of the city on Warminster Road are where the sports pitches at Norton Sports Park located. The university also operates Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres (AMRCs) on the border of Sheffield, in Rotherham and Lancashire. The Conference Centre and Teaching Hall at Philadelphia Campus of St. Thomas&#x27; Church are used as exam venues by the university.

===Former locations===
The old Firth College building was built in 1879 at the corner of Leopold Street and West Street. It was designed by Thomas James Flockton and Edward Robert Robson with the front facing West Street. Firth College moved out of the building following the establishment of the university. The building later housed the Sheffield Central Technical School and is currently home to Education Committee offices of Sheffield City Council. Situated on 7 Leopold Street opposite Firth College, the old Medical School building was designed by John Dodsley Webster and completed in 1888. The school moved to Firth Court in 1905 and the building is now used as offices.

The Manvers campus, at Wath-on-Dearne between Rotherham and Barnsley, was where the majority of nursing was taught. A three-storey building, Humphry Davy House (named after chemist Humphry Davy), was built in 1998 on Golden Smithies Lane opposite to Dearne Valley College. The building was home to the School of Nursing and Midwifery, which was established in 1995 after the merger of the university with Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery. In 2004, the university disagreed with the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority&#x27;s decision to take away part of its nursing and midwifery training contract, and declined the offer due to financial and operational constraints. The last intake of midwifery studies students was in July 2006, and the campus was closed one year later. The building was sold in 2018 and to be converted for residential lettings.

From 2022 to 2023, students protested against the university working with and accepting payment for various activities from companies including Rolls Royce, BAE Systems, and Boeing who are involved in the arms manufacturing industry.

===Faculties and departments===
Sheffield had four faculties in 1905, which were Arts, Pure Science, Medicine and Applied Science. The Faculty of Applied Science later split into Engineering and Metallurgy in 1919. As well as educating full-time students, in the early 20th century, the university taught non-degree courses that covered non-conventional, occupation-focused subjects such as cow-keeping, railway economics, mining and razor-grinding.

====Faculty of Arts and Humanities====
The Faculty of Arts and Humanities is made up of eight schools and departments. It is also home to three institutes (Humanities Research Institute, Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies, and Digital Humanities Institute) and 16 research centres. The Centre for Research into Freemasonry and Fraternalism of the faculty was the first centre devoted to scholarly research into Freemasonry in a UK university. The centre was closed in 2010, ten years after its establishment, due to its failure to capture substantial grants to support the centre&#x27;s activities. In May 2021, archaeology staff at the university have been told their jobs could be at risk after a review. A petition to save the department has gathered more than 35,000 signatures but the university said no decisions had yet been taken, but later changed to announcing they intended to dissolve the department, which was met with international outcry.

====Faculty of Engineering====
The precursor to the Faculty of Engineering is the Sheffield Technical School established in the 1880s, which offered part-time and evening class programme to adults working in the steel industry. During 1917, departments of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering and Mechanical Engineering were founded in response to the needs of the First World War. The departments provided training courses for injured and incapacitated soldiers, and manufactured inspection gauges and munition shells. The Faculty of Engineering has now over 6,700 students and 1,000 staff. Over 90% of the research from the department was rated as 4* (world-leading) or 3* (internationally excellent).

====Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health====
The Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health is made up of four schools, including the Medical School, Health Sciences School, School of Clinical Dentistry and School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR). The Medical School is the oldest school of the university. It operated independently as the Sheffield School of Medicine until its mergers with Firth College and with Sheffield Technical School. The Medical School is located next to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, one of the Sheffield&#x27;s teaching hospitals, and the school is associated with Sheffield Children&#x27;s Hospital, Northern General Hospital, Weston Park Hospital and Charles Clifford Dental Hospital. It is one of 32 bodies entitled to award medical degrees in the United Kingdom by the General Medical Council (GMC), the body responsible for registering doctors to practise medicine as well as regulating medical education and training in the United Kingdom.

====Faculty of Science====
The Faculty of Science comprises seven classical science departments: Animal and Plant Sciences, Biomedical Science, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Physics and Astronomy, and Psychology. All of the university&#x27;s six Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with this faculty.

The Department of Animal and Plant Sciences is one of the largest departments dedicated for whole-organism biology studies in the UK. Biology has been taught in Sheffield since 1884 in Firth College. Appointed the first Professor of Biology in 1888, Alfred Denny was the only biologist in the Department of Biology at the college who taught zoology and botany to science and medical students. In 1896, a second biologist, botanist Bertram H. Bentley, joined the college. Soon after the university was founded, in 1908, two separate departments were established: Zoology (head by Denny) and Botany (head by Bentley). The departments were not merged until the establishment of the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences in 1988, as part of a major rationalisation at the university. David H. Lewis, who was Head of Botany, was the first Head of Animal and Plant Sciences. The department was awarded a maximum score of 24 points in the QAA Teaching Quality Assessment in 1999, and top five for biological sciences research in the REF 2014.

==== Faculty of Social Sciences ====

The Sheffield School of Architecture is consistently ranked among the top 10 in Europe and the UK for &quot;Architecture and the Built-Environment&quot; and is one of the longest established architecture schools in the UK, opening in 1908. It was first located in the tower of Firth Court but soon moved to the Sunday School in Shearwood Road and is located on the top 6 floors of the Arts Tower since 1965. The school has courses accredited by the Architects Registration Board (ARB) and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and has an active student society (SUAS). In the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014, Sheffield School of Architecture ranked 4th in the UK.

Established in 1986, the Management School is a triple-accredited (AMBA, AACSB and EQUIS) business school. In 2013 the school moved into newly refurbished facilities close to the University of Sheffield campus and Broomhill. It now has dedicated learning and teaching space, a courtyard, dedicated café and Employability Hub.

The Information School (iSchool) is a constituent school of the Faculty of Social Sciences. It was founded as Postgraduate School of Librarianship in 1963 and became the Department of Information Studies in 1981. In 2010, the Information School devoting to the study of the information field was established. The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath. The school is ranked second in the world and first in Europe for Library and Information Studies in the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; 2020.

The Department of Urban Studies and Planning (USP) was founded as the Department of Town and Regional Planning (TRP) in 1965 and is located in the Geography Building in the Western Bank Campus. It was ranked as the top RTPI accredited planning school in the UK by the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) and second for &quot;Building and town and country planning&quot; by the &quot;Guardian University Rankings&quot; 2021.

====International faculty====
The university has an international faculty called CITY College in Thessaloniki, the second largest city of Greece, which is the only faculty operating outside the UK. The faculty was established in 1989 in order to bridge the UK with the Southeast and Eastern Europe. It is a private legal entity operating as CITY College according to the local law in Greece. The International Faculty consists of four departments, namely Business Administration and Economics, Psychology, Computer Science and English Studies. These departments are housed in the L. Sofou Building and the Strategakis Building, two buildings in close proximity in Thessaloniki city centre. The faculty also operates the South East European Research Centre (SEERC), a multidisciplinary research centre established in 2003.

===Governance===
There are several bodies which govern the university, including the council, the Senate and the faculties. The council is the governing body of the university, which is responsible for the strategic development, legal and regulatory affairs, and performance of university business (finance and property). Council membership comprises a majority of non-executive lay members appointed under the statutes of the university. The chair and pro-chancellor of the council is currently Tony Pedder. The Senate manages the academic side of the university. It is the highest academic authority of the university, and is also responsible for the regulation of research work and students&#x27; discipline. The Senate is chaired by the vice-chancellor, with its membership drawn mainly from the university&#x27;s academic staff. The five faculties regulates departmental teaching, research, examination, and also admission. They are responsible for making recommendations to the Senate on the award of degrees, fellowships, and academic staff appointments and promotions.

The university central committees also include the University Executive Board, whose members are: president and vice-chancellor (or simply vice-chancellor), provost and deputy vice chancellor, chief financial officer, executive director of corporate services, executive director of academic services, five faculty vice-presidents, three cross-cutting vice-presidents (education, innovation and research), and university secretary. The board provides leadership and management, as well as advises the vice-chancellor on operational matters. the vice-chancellor is the chief executive and accountable officer of the university. The current vice-chancellor is Koen Lamberts, and the provost and deputy vice chancellor is Gill Valentine.

The Court of the university is no longer a university committee. The Court was a large body which fosters relations between the university and the community, and included lay members, many of whom are university alumni. Ex-officio members of the Court included all the members of Parliament (MPs) of Sheffield, the Bishops of Sheffield and Hallam, and the chief constable of South Yorkshire Police. It also included representatives of professional bodies such as the Arts Council, Royal Society and the General Medical Council. The Court met annually to receive reports from the council, the Senate and the Students&#x27; Union. It served many official functions including chancellor election.

===Coat of arms===
The arms of the university was granted by the College of Arms on 28 June 1905. It is on an azure shield with a gold-edged book inscribed with the Latin &quot;Disce Doce&quot; (Learn and Teach) at its centre, a sheaf of eight silver arrows on either side (from the arms of the city), the Crown of Success and the White Rose of York. Below is a scroll carrying the motto &quot;Rerum cognoscere causas&quot; (To Discover the Causes of Things; from the &quot;Georgics&quot; by Latin poet Virgil), which was also the motto of Firth College since 1879. In heraldic terminology, the official coat of arms is blazoned as follows:
&quot;Azure, an open book proper, edged gold, inscribed with the words Disce Doce between in fess two sheaves of eight arrows interlaced saltireways and banded argent, in chief an open crown or, and in base a rose also argent barbed and seeded proper.&quot;
The current university&#x27;s logo, consists of a redrawn version of the coat of arms and the name of the institution, is introduced in 2005, the centenary year of the university. However, the logo should not supersede and be confused with the coat of arms, which remains the official heraldic symbol of the university.

===University Fonts===
The university&#x27;s fonts are TUOS Stephenson (serif) and TUOS Blake (sans-serif). Both TUOS Stephenson and TUOS Blake are modified versions of a typeface designed by Sheffield company Stephenson &amp; Blake Co. The two fonts are the copyright property of the University of Sheffield and are restricted only to university users. The university brand (encompassing the visual identity) is led by its motto &quot;Rerum cognoscere causas&quot; and centred on the theme of &quot;discovery&quot;. The theme has been applied across print, screen and other areas such as signage, vehicle livery and merchandising.

===Ceremony===
====Academic dress====

As at most universities, Sheffield graduands wear academic dress appropriate to the degree they are to be received when graduating. Bachelors wear a black Oxford BA [b1] gown (see Groves classification system). The hood is in green, half-lined with white fur, and edged with two inches of silk of the colour distinctive of the degree or the faculty. Masters wear a black Oxford MA [m1] gown with a hood of green silk which is lined throughout with the faculty colour. The PhD and the MPhil hoods are lined in green. Research doctors have a fine scarlet cloth gown with green silk facings, with bell-shaped sleeves [d2]; higher doctorates wear the robe with full sleeves that are lined scarlet silk and the lining held up at the elbow level with a scarlet cord and button [d1]. The hood is of the Cambridge shape [f1] and is made of red ottoman silk. In 1993, the postgraduate diplomate hood is entered in the Calendar of the University of Sheffield. It is a blend of Bachelors&#x27; and Masters&#x27; hoods, with a hood of green silk and a neckband of the faculty colour.

The faculty and degree colours are: Arts and Humanities—crushed strawberry; Music (only for BMus, MMus, and DMus degrees)—cream brocade; Engineering—purple; Medicine and Surgery—red; Dental Surgery—pale rose pink; Health—cerise; Science—apricot; Social Sciences—lemon yellow; International Faculty—Saxon blue; Board of Extra Faculty Provision—pale blue. Some schools at Sheffield had previously their own colours but are no longer used. They were: Metallurgy—steel grey; Education—pearl; Architecture—old gold; Law—olive green. The old colour of the Faculty of Social Sciences was pale green.

====University mace====
The university mace is an ornament of governance of the University of Sheffield. It is silver-gilt and carries the coats of arms of both the university and the city of Sheffield, and the White Rose of York. A figure of Minerva holding a wreath and palm branch on a heraldic crown adorns the top of the mace. Used for the first time in 1909, the mace is carried in academic procession as the symbol of authority, which precedes the presiding officer.

In the ARWU rankings of 2022, the university achieved 8th place in Geography and Urban Planning, 38th in Civil Engineering, and 46th in Ecology.

=== Admissions ===

The University of Sheffield has a total of 30,195 students in the 2018–19 academic year, including 19,610 undergraduates and 10,585 postgraduates. In terms of average UCAS points of entrants, Sheffield ranked 29th in Britain in 2014. The university gives offers of admission to 85.6% of its applicants, the 4th highest amongst the Russell Group.

According to the 2017 &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide, approximately 13% of Sheffield&#x27;s undergraduates come from independent schools. In the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 71:5:24 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 51:49. 57.8% of international students enrolled at the institution are from China, the second highest proportion out of all mainstream universities in the UK.

===Libraries===

The University of Sheffield has currently four libraries: Western Bank Library, the Information Commons, Health Sciences Library (Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Northern General Hospital), and The Diamond, holding a total of 1.5 million printed books. Western Bank Library was the university&#x27;s main library until the opening of the Information Commons in 2007. The Grade II* listed library has 730 study spaces and contains 1.2 million texts for most subjects, as well as archives and special collections. The Information Commons (IC) is a 24/7 learning centre combining both library and IT services, which was the first of its kind in the UK. The IC houses 120,000 core textbooks for all undergraduate and postgraduate subjects, and has approximately 1,300 study spaces and 550 PCs. The university has two medical libraries collectively called the Health Sciences Library. It was opened at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in 1978, and a year later a branch at the Northern General Hospital was opened. The Royal Hallamshire Hospital library has collections cover medicine, dentistry, nursing and midwifery, and the Northern General Hospital library contains material for medicine and nursing. Opened its door in 2018, the Diamond provides 24-hour library services (and other teaching facilities), with in-demand textbooks, a non-loanable reference collection and over 1,000 study spaces. It replaces the 1992 St George&#x27;s Library on St George&#x27;s Campus as the main engineering library and study space. The University of Sheffield Library is a member of Research Libraries UK.

Former libraries include Edgar Allen Library closed by the late 1950s and St George&#x27;s Library closed on 14 June 2015. Edgar Allen Library was the first university library. In 1905 when the university was established, the library was housed in a lecture room due to lack of funds to construct a purpose-built library. William Edgar Allen, a member of the University Council, provided £10,000 to build a proper library named Edgar Allen Library, locating beside the main university building (Firth Court). Edgar Allen Library had 100 seats in its reading room, shelves for 20,000 books, and a stack space for 60,000 more books. Sir Charles Harding Firth, the first lecturer in Modern History in Firth College, donated part of his personal collection to the library. Sheffield Town Trustee also helped the university to transform the General Lecture Theatre into a reading room housing the Firth Collection (rare book collection of approximately 20,000 volumes) in 1931. As the university rapidly expanded in the 1950s, it became necessary to replace Edgar Allen Library with a modern post-war era library. The library, later known as the Western Bank Library, was opened on 12 May 1959. Edgar Allen Library (now the Rotunda in Firth Court) became the Registrar and Secretary&#x27;s Office. St George&#x27;s Library (now 38 Mappin Street) was refurbished as an exam venue.

===Museums and collections===
The Alfred Denny Museum is a zoology museum operated by the university. Established in 1905, the museum was located in Firth Court, spanning three floors, and was named after the first professor of biology at Sheffield in 1950. It has specimens from all major phyla, and two letters written from Charles Darwin to Henry Denny, father of Alfred Denny. Many of the specimens have been collected since the 1900s, but much of the information about the collection was lost during the Second World War. The museum, now reduced in size, has been moved to Alfred Denny Building after the war. The museum is not open to the public at all time but usually on the first Saturday of each month.

The Turner Museum of Glass houses the university&#x27;s collections of 19th and 20th century glass. It contains items mainly from major European and American glassworkers and examples from ancient Egypt and Rome. It is in the Hadfield Building. It was founded by W. E. S. Turner of the university in 1943. One of the exhibits is the wedding dress of Helen Nairn (Turner&#x27;s wife) which is made of glass fibre. This has been selected as one of the items in the BBC&#x27;s A History of the World in 100 Objects.

The Traditional Heritage Museum (THM) was opened to the public in 1985 as part of the National Centre for English Cultural Tradition. It was created (and curated) by Prof John Widdowson in 1964 and was entirely run by volunteers and students. The THM housed collections including a replica kitchen from the 1920s, reconstructed workshops and retail shops, such as Pollard&#x27;s tea and coffee. The university decided to close the Museum in 2011 because the building could not afford continued public access. In 2013, the collections from the Traditional Heritage Museum were relocated and are accessible again to the public. The majority of the items was transferred to not-for-profit organisation Green Estate (operators of the Sheffield Manor Lodge). Other major recipients include Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust, Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust and Ken Hawley Trust.

The Western Bank Library has an Exhibition Gallery. It is located on the mezzanine level of the library, enabling special collections from the university library and the National Fairground Archive to be displayed in controlled conditions. In 2010, the gallery was restored and refurbished by a grant from the Wolfson Foundation. The library usually schedules three temporary exhibitions per year, and most of the exhibitions are free to visit during library opening hours.

The Henry Clifton Sorby Collection contains glass lantern slides of marine organisms prepared and donated by Henry Clifton Sorby in the 1900s. Sorby was president of Firth College after the death of Mark Firth, vice-president of the University College of Sheffield, and a member of the Council of the University of Sheffield. His broad interests included marine biology, and he had developed a technique for preparing and mounting invertebrate marine animals onto slides. The specimens were cleared and stained so that enabling projection onto a screen for viewing. The glass lantern slides are now held in the Department Animal and Plant Sciences. 
The Sheffield Herbarium is also operated by the Department Animal and Plant Sciences, with a collection of preserved plant specimens collected in the late 19th century and early to mid 20th century. The collection is mainly from the British Isles and Europe focusing on tracheophytes, bryophytes, charophytes and fungi. Many of the micro-fungi specimens are from the collection of mycologist and Sheffield alumnus John Webster.

The National Fairground and Circus Archive (NFCA) is a living archive that collects material from the fairground, circus and the allied entertainment industries. NFCA was in 1994 developed out of the PhD research by Vanessa Toulmin, who was later director of the archive from its inception until 2016. With its own Reading Room situated in Western Bank Library, the archive holds 150,000 photographs, 4,000 books and journals, together with over 20,000 items of printed and video ephemera. Major collections include the Shufflebottom Family Collection, the John Bramwell Taylor Collection, the Malcolm Airey Collection and the John Turner Collection.

===Flagship institutes===
Sheffield has four research institutes. Launched in 2019, the institutes focus on clean energy generation, sustainable food, health improvement and quality of life. The Energy Institute is one of the largest energy research centres in Europe. It has over 300 researchers working on energy-related problems, including improving energy efficiency and developing ways to achieve clean growth. The Neuroscience Institute works on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. This includes the exploration of artificial intelligence applications in healthcare for diagnosing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and improving prognosis. The Healthy Lifespan Institute researches multimorbidity and slowing down the ageing process. The Institute for Sustainable Food studies food security and environmental sustainability.

===Academic and industrial partners===
The University of Sheffield&#x27;s major research partners and clients include Boeing, Rolls-Royce, Siemens, Unilever, Boots, AstraZeneca, GSK, ICI, and Slazenger, as well as UK and overseas government agencies and charitable foundations. Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is a network of centres and a partnership between the university and over a hundred industrial companies on the Advanced Manufacturing Park. The university also works with local small and medium enterprises through the dedicated physical spaces at the Sheffield Bioincubator and Kroto Innovation Centre. For many years the university has been engaged in theological publishing through Sheffield Academic Press and JSOT Press. The university is also a partner organisation in Higher Futures, a collaborative association of institutions set up under the government&#x27;s Lifelong Learning Networks initiative, to co-ordinate vocational and work-based education.

As well as the research carried out in departments, the university has over 180 specialised research centres or institutes. The last Teaching Quality Assessment awarded Sheffield University grades of &quot;excellent&quot; in 29 subject areas, a record equalled by only a few other UK universities. The National Epitaxy Facility at Sheffield is leading the semiconductor research &amp; development in collaboration with The University of Cambridge and University College London.

The University of Sheffield has around 250 student exchange partners in nearly 40 countries world-wide including exchange programs with Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Texas at Austin, National University of Singapore, University of Munich and University of Melbourne.

== Controversies ==

=== Proposed closure of the Department of Archaeology ===

On 25 May 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Sheffield Executive Board (UEB) including Vice Chancellor Koen Lamberts and Deputy Vice Chancellor Gill Valentine voted to close the Department of Archaeology and move two areas into other departments; a world leading institution since its formation in 1976. The decision had been made through a commissioned Institutional Review process chaired by Valentine and was met with national and international outcry including a petition signed by over 40,000 people. The decision was announced first on 19 May. The review process had begun in February 2022 led by Valentine.

===Involvement with the arms trade===
Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre conducts a wide range of research projects including some funded by arms manufacturers such as BAE Systems. In 2008, the university partnered with BAE Systems to launch a new Centre for Research in Active Control which aimed to improve the stealth of BAE Systems&#x27; submarines. In 2012 the Students Union voted in favour of the university ending all links with the arms trade.

In October 2022, students occupied &#x27;The Diamond&#x27; over the university&#x27;s alleged links with Rolls-Royce, and their involvement in arms manufacture. This resulted in the closure of the building, with the occupiers refusing to leave until negotiations with the Vice-Chancellor commenced. Over the past eight years, the university has received some £47 million from Rolls-Royce. The following month, the university hired a private investigator to investigate two students for &quot;alleged misconduct&quot; in relation to the protests. In November 2023, students interrupted the opening ceremony of the university&#x27;s newest building, in support of Palestine and in protest over the university&#x27;s financial contracts with arms manufacturers, including BAE Systems, GKN and Boeing.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; Union===
The University of Sheffield Students&#x27; Union was founded in 1906 and has nearly 300 student societies and nearly 50 sports teams. The Students&#x27; Union has been voted best in the UK for ten consecutive years, from 2009 to 2018, by The Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey.

Sheffield University Football Club has been established for many decades and has previously competed in the FA Amateur Cup and FA Vase. The Union building contains society and union workplaces and coffee shops, restaurants, shops, and the student run cinema Film Unit. Facilities include two bars (&quot;Bar One&quot; – which has a book-able function room with its own bar, &quot;The Raynor Lounge&quot; – and &quot;The Interval&quot;); a three-room club venue (&quot;Foundry&quot;); There is also a student radio station called Forge Radio, a TV station called Forge TV, and a newspaper called &quot;Forge Press&quot;, which are run under the umbrella of Forge Media since 2008.

In November 2009 a development project began to redevelop the Students&#x27; Union building, funded by £5 million by the HEFCE, which was completed and re-opened in September 2010. Works centred on improving circulation around the building by aligning previously disjointed floors, improving internal access between the Union building and neighbouring University House, and constructing a new entrance and lobby that incorporates the university&#x27;s traditional colours of black and gold. During 2012–13 the Students&#x27; Union went under a further redevelopment costing £20 million which led to the refurbishment of the University House. University House, completed in 1963, has been integrated with the university&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union in one single building.

===Student accommodation===
The university halls of residence comprises two separate sites: Ranmoor/Endcliffe and City. Ranmoor/Endcliffe is situated in the western suburb of Sheffield, which is close to Broomhill and Ecclesall Road. The Endcliffe Village was opened in 2008 and the Ranmoor Village in 2009. Ranmoor House, opened in the autumn term of 1968, was once the largest hall of residence at the university, housing around 800 students. As part of the university&#x27;s Student Residences Strategy, Ranmoor House was demolished in March 2008, a year before the new Ranmoor Village was scheduled to open. The Endcliffe and Ranmoor villages have been together referred to as Ranmoor/Endcliffe since 2016. The Endcliffe Village was renamed &quot;South accommodation (near Endcliffe)&quot;, and the Ranmoor Village &quot;North accommodation (near Ranmoor)&quot;. City accommodation, including Allen Court, Broad Lane Court, St. George&#x27;s Flats, Mappin Court and Studio 300, are located on the Main Campus, on St George&#x27;s Campus, or near the North Campus.

Off campus can be found Sheffield Student Housing Co-operative, a student housing cooperative providing not-for-profit, student-managed housing for its members. They currently manage a property on Northfield Road in Crookes, Sheffield.

===Sheffield Varsity===
The annual Sheffield Varsity is an annual varsity match that takes place between sports teams from the university and its rival Sheffield Hallam University starting from 1996. The varsity is divided into winter and summer competitions. Over 1,000 students from both universities compete in over 30 varsity sports in more than 70 events. The university&#x27;s sports colours are black and gold. Sheffield won the Varsity competition in 2013, beating Hallam for the first time in ten years. It extended the newfound winning streak to seven years in a row; winning again from 2014 to 2019.

<text>Temple () is a station on Paris Métro Line 3, located in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under Rue de Turbigo at its exit on Rue du Temple, nearby Place Élisabeth-Dmitrieff. Oriented along a northeast–southwest axis, it is located between the Arts et Métiers and République stations, the latter being geographically very close to it.

==History==
It opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of the line opened between Père Lachaise and Villiers.

It is named after the Temple, a long-demolished Templar fortification that once stood in the square named after it. It is the only Paris Metro station to share its name with a station on the London Underground.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the entire station was renovated by 29 October 2003.

In 2018, 1,258,217 travelers entered this station which places it at 209th position of the metro stations for its usage out of 302.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single entrance entitled &quot;Place Élisabeth-Dmitrieff&quot;, leading to said square formed by the corner of Rue du Temple and Rue de Turbigo (named in honor of Elisabeth Dmitrieff on 8 March 2007, International Women&#x27;s Day). Consisting of a fixed staircase, it is adorned with a Guimard entrance, which is the subject of registration as a historic monuments by a decree of 29 May 1978.

Between the entry and the access corridors to the platform, a mosaic by the French artist Hervé Mathieu-Bachelot has been installed since 1982: &quot;Couleur en masses&quot;.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Temple is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the style used for most metro stations, the lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro des années 2000s&quot;, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The platforms are equipped with benches made of wooden slats.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 20 and 75 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N12 and N23 of the Noctilien network.

<doc id="310429" wikidata="Q166907" url="?curid=310429" title="Cluster headache">
<text>Cluster headache is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent severe headaches on one side of the head, typically around the eye(s). There is often accompanying eye watering, nasal congestion, or swelling around the eye on the affected side. These symptoms typically last 15 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks often occur in clusters which typically last for weeks or months and occasionally more than a year.
The cause is unknown, but is most likely related to dysfunction of the posterior hypothalamus. Risk factors include a history of exposure to tobacco smoke and a family history of the condition. Exposures which may trigger attacks include alcohol, nitroglycerin, and histamine. They are a primary headache disorder of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias type. Diagnosis is based on symptoms.
Recommended management includes lifestyle adaptations such as avoiding potential triggers. Treatments for acute attacks include oxygen or a fast-acting triptan. Measures recommended to decrease the frequency of attacks include steroid injections, galcanezumab, civamide, verapamil, or oral glucocorticoids such as prednisone. Nerve stimulation or surgery may occasionally be used if other measures are not effective.
The condition affects about 0.1% of the general population at some point in their life and 0.05% in any given year. The condition usually first occurs between 20 and 40 years of age. Men are affected about four times more often than women. Cluster headaches are named for the occurrence of groups of headache attacks (clusters). They have also been referred to as &quot;suicide headaches&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Cluster headaches are recurring bouts of severe unilateral headache attacks. The duration of a typical cluster headache ranges from about 15 to 180 minutes. About 75% of untreated attacks last less than 60 minutes. However, women may have longer and more severe cluster headaches.

The onset of an attack is rapid and typically without an aura. Preliminary sensations of pain in the general area of attack, referred to as &quot;shadows&quot;, may signal an imminent cluster headache, or these symptoms may linger after an attack has passed, or between attacks. Though cluster headaches are strictly unilateral, there are some documented cases of &quot;side-shift&quot; between cluster periods, or, rarely, simultaneous (within the same cluster period) bilateral cluster headaches.

===Pain===
The pain occurs only on one side of the head, around the eye, particularly behind or above the eye, in the temple. The pain is typically greater than in other headache conditions, including migraines, and is usually described as burning, stabbing, drilling or squeezing. While suicide is rare, those with cluster headaches may experience suicidal thoughts (giving the alternative name &quot;suicide headache&quot; or &quot;suicidal headache&quot;). The disease is considered among the most painful conditions known to medical science.
Dr. Peter Goadsby, Professor of Clinical Neurology at University College London, a leading researcher on the condition has commented: 

===Other symptoms===
The typical symptoms of cluster headache include grouped occurrence and recurrence (cluster) of headache attack, severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and/or temporal pain. If left untreated, attack frequency may range from one attack every two days to eight attacks per day. Cluster headache attack is accompanied by at least one of the following autonomic symptoms: drooping eyelid, pupil constriction, redness of the conjunctiva, tearing, runny nose and less commonly, facial blushing, swelling, or sweating, typically appearing on the same side of the head as the pain. Similar to a migraine, sensitivity to light (photophobia) or noise (phonophobia) may occur during a cluster headache. Nausea is a rare symptom although it has been reported.

Restlessness (for example, pacing or rocking back and forth) may occur. Secondary effects may include the inability to organize thoughts and plans, physical exhaustion, confusion, agitation, aggressiveness, depression, and anxiety.

People with cluster headaches may dread facing another headache and adjust their physical or social activities around a possible future occurrence. Likewise they may seek assistance to accomplish what would otherwise be normal tasks. They may hesitate to make plans because of the regularity, or conversely, the unpredictability of the pain schedule. These factors can lead to generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorder, serious depressive disorders, social withdrawal and isolation.

Cluster headaches have been recently associated with obstructive sleep apnea comorbidity.

===Recurrence===
Cluster headaches may occasionally be referred to as &quot;alarm clock headache&quot; because of the regularity of their recurrence. Cluster headaches often awaken individuals from sleep. Both individual attacks and the cluster grouping can have a metronomic regularity; attacks typically strike at a precise time of day each morning or night. The recurrence of headache cluster grouping may occur more often around solstices, or seasonal changes, sometimes showing circannual periodicity. Conversely, attack frequency may be highly unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all. These observations have prompted researchers to speculate an involvement or dysfunction of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the body&#x27;s &quot;biological clock&quot; and circadian rhythm. In episodic cluster headache, attacks occur once or more daily, often at the same time each day for a period of several weeks, followed by a headache-free period lasting weeks, months, or years. Approximately 10–15% of cluster headaches are chronic, with multiple headaches occurring every day for years, sometimes without any remission.

In accordance with the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria, cluster headaches occurring in two or more cluster periods, lasting from 7 to 365 days with a pain-free remission of one month or longer between the headache attacks may be classified as episodic. If headache attacks occur for more than a year without pain-free remission of at least three months, the condition is classified as chronic.
Chronic cluster headaches both occur and recur without any remission periods between cycles; there may be variation in cycles, meaning the frequency and severity of attacks may change without predictability for a period of time. The frequency, severity, and duration of headache attacks experienced by people during these cycles varies between individuals and does not demonstrate complete remission of the episodic form. The condition may change unpredictably from chronic to episodic and from episodic to chronic.

==Causes==

The specific causes and pathogenesis of cluster headaches are not fully understood. The Third Edition of the International Classification of Headache disorders classifies cluster headaches as belonging to the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.

Some experts consider the posterior hypothalamus to be important in the pathogenesis of cluster headaches. This is supported by a relatively high success ratio of deep-brain stimulation therapy on the posterior hypothalamic grey matter.

===Nerves===
Therapies acting on the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) and the greater occipital nerve have both shown efficacy in managing cluster headache, but the specific roles of these nerves are not well-understood. Two nerves thought to play an important role in cluster headaches include the trigeminal nerve and the facial nerve.

===Genetics===
Cluster headache may run in some families in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. People with a first degree relative with the condition are about 14–48 times more likely to develop it themselves, and around 8 to 10% of persons with cluster headaches have a family history. Several studies have found a higher number of relatives affected among females. Others have suggested these observations may be due to lower numbers of females in these studies. Possible genetic factors warrant further research, current evidence for genetic inheritance is limited.

Genes that are thought to play a role in the disease are the hypocretin/orexin receptor type 2 (HCRTR2), alcohol dehydrogenase 4(ADH4), G protein beta 3 (GNB3), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (ADCYAP1R1), and membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) genes.

===Tobacco smoking===
About 65% of persons with cluster headache are, or have been, tobacco smokers. Stopping smoking does not lead to improvement of the condition, and cluster headaches also occur in those who have never smoked (e.g., children); it is thought unlikely that smoking is a cause. People with cluster headaches may be predisposed to certain traits, including smoking or other lifestyle habits.

===Hypothalamus===
A review suggests that the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which is the major biological clock in the human body, may be involved in cluster headaches, because cluster headaches occur with diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate the brain areas which are activated during attack only, compared to pain free periods. These pictures show brain areas that are active during pain in yellow/orange color (called &quot;pain matrix&quot;). The area in the center (in all three views) is activated only during cluster headaches. The bottom row voxel-based morphometry shows structural brain differences between individuals with and without CH; only a portion of the hypothalamus is different.

==Diagnosis==
Cluster-like head pain may be diagnosed as secondary headache rather than cluster headache.

A detailed oral history aids practitioners in correct differential diagnosis, as there are no confirmatory tests for cluster headache. A headache diary can be useful in tracking when and where pain occurs, how severe it is, and how long the pain lasts. A record of coping strategies used may help distinguish between headache type; data on frequency, severity and duration of headache attacks are a necessary tool for initial and correct differential diagnosis in headache conditions.

Correct diagnosis presents a challenge as the first cluster headache attack may present where staff are not trained in the diagnosis of rare or complex chronic disease. Experienced ER staff are sometimes trained to detect headache types. While cluster headache attacks themselves are not directly life-threatening, suicide ideation has been observed.

Individuals with cluster headaches typically experience diagnostic delay before correct diagnosis. People are often misdiagnosed due to reported neck, tooth, jaw, and sinus symptoms and may unnecessarily endure many years of referral to ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists for investigation of sinuses; dentists for tooth assessment; chiropractors and manipulative therapists for treatment; or psychiatrists, psychologists, and other medical disciplines before their headaches are correctly diagnosed. Under-recognition of cluster headaches by health care professionals is reflected in consistent findings in Europe and the United States that the average time to diagnosis is around seven years.

===Differential===
Cluster headache may be misdiagnosed as migraine or sinusitis. Other types of headache are sometimes mistaken for, or may mimic closely, cluster headaches. Incorrect terms like &quot;cluster migraine&quot; confuse headache types, confound differential diagnosis and are often the cause of unnecessary diagnostic delay, ultimately delaying appropriate specialist treatment.

Other types of headaches that may be confused with cluster headache include:
* Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania is a unilateral headache condition, without the male predominance usually seen in cluster headaches. Paroxysmal hemicrania may also be episodic but the episodes of pain seen in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania are usually shorter than those seen with cluster headaches. Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania typically responds &quot;absolutely&quot; to treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin where in most cases cluster headaches typically show no indomethacin response, making &quot;indomethacin response&quot; an important diagnostic tool for specialist practitioners seeking correct differential diagnosis between the conditions.
* Hemicrania continua
* Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) is a headache syndrome belonging to the group of TACs.
* Trigeminal neuralgia is a unilateral headache syndrome, or &quot;cluster-like&quot; headache.

==Prevention==
Management for cluster headache is divided into three primary categories: abortive, transitional, and preventive. Preventive treatments are used to reduce or eliminate cluster headache attacks; they are generally used in combination with abortive and transitional techniques.

===Verapamil===
The recommended first-line preventive therapy is verapamil, a calcium channel blocker. Verapamil was previously underused in people with cluster headache.
Improvement can be seen in an average of 1.7 weeks for episodic cluster headache and 5 weeks for chronic cluster headache when using a dosage of ranged between 160 and 720 mg (mean 240 mg/day). Preventive therapy with verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian rhythm and on CGRPs as CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels.

===Glucocorticoids===

Since these compounds are steroids, there is little evidence to support long-term benefits from glucocorticoids, but they may be used until other medications take effect as they appear to be effective at three days. They are generally discontinued after 8–10 days of treatment. Prednisone is given at a starting dose of 60–80 milligrams daily; then it is reduced by 5 milligrams every day. Corticosteroids are also used to break cycles, especially in chronic patients.

===Surgery===
Nerve stimulators may be an option in the small number of people who do not improve with medications. Two procedures, deep brain stimulation or occipital nerve stimulation, may be useful; early experience shows a benefit in about 60% of cases. It typically takes weeks or months for this benefit to appear. A non-invasive method using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is being studied.

A number of surgical procedures, such as a rhizotomy or microvascular decompression, may also be considered, but evidence to support them is limited and there are cases of people whose symptoms worsen after these procedures.

===Other===
Lithium, methysergide, and topiramate are recommended alternative treatments, although there is little evidence supporting the use of topiramate or methysergide. This is also true for tianeptine, melatonin, and ergotamine. Valproate, sumatriptan, and oxygen are not recommended as preventive measures. Botulinum toxin injections have shown limited success. Evidence for baclofen, botulinum toxin, and capsaicin is unclear.

==Management==
There are two primary treatments for acute CH: oxygen and triptans, but they are underused due to misdiagnosis of the syndrome. During bouts of headaches, triggers such as alcohol, nitroglycerine, and naps during the day should be avoided.

===Oxygen===
Oxygen therapy may help to abort attacks, though it does not prevent future episodes. Typically it is given via a non-rebreather mask at 12–15 liters per minute for 15–20 minutes. One review found about 70% of patients improve within 15 minutes. The evidence for effectiveness of 100% oxygen, however, is weak. Hyperbaric oxygen at pressures of ~2 times greater than atmospheric pressure may relieve cluster headaches.

===Triptans===
The other primarily recommended treatment of acute attacks is subcutaneous or intranasal sumatriptan. Sumatriptan and zolmitriptan have both been shown to improve symptoms during an attack with sumatriptan being superior. Because of the vasoconstrictive side-effect of triptans, they may be contraindicated in people with ischemic heart disease. The vasoconstrictor ergot compounds may be useful, but have not been well studied in acute attacks.

===Opioids===
The use of opioid medication in management of cluster headache is not recommended and may make headache syndromes worse. Long-term opioid use is associated with well known dependency, addiction, and withdrawal syndromes. Prescription of opioid medication may additionally lead to further delay in differential diagnosis, undertreatment, and mismanagement.

===Other===
Intranasal lidocaine (sprayed in the ipsilateral nostril) may be an effective treatment with patient resistant to more conventional treatment.

Octreotide administered subcutaneously has been demonstrated to be more effective than placebo for the treatment of acute attacks.

Sub-occipital steroid injections have shown benefit and are recommended for use as a transitional therapy to provide temporary headache relief as more long term prophylactic therapies are instituted.

==Epidemiology==
Cluster headache affects about 0.1% of the general population at some point in their life. Males are affected about four times more often than females. The condition usually starts between the ages of 20 and 50 years, although it can occur at any age. About one in five of adults reports the onset of cluster headache between 10 and 19 years.

==History==
The first complete description of cluster headache was given by the London neurologist Wilfred Harris in 1926, who named the disease &quot;migrainous neuralgia&quot;. Descriptions of cluster headache date to 1745 and probably earlier.

The condition was originally named Horton&#x27;s cephalalgia after Bayard Taylor Horton, a US neurologist who postulated the first theory as to their pathogenesis. His original paper describes the severity of the headaches as being able to take normal men and force them to attempt or die by suicide; his 1939 paper said:

CH has alternately been called erythroprosopalgia of Bing, ciliary neuralgia, erythromelalgia of the head, Horton&#x27;s headache, histaminic cephalalgia, petrosal neuralgia, sphenopalatine neuralgia, vidian neuralgia, Sluder&#x27;s neuralgia, Sluder&#x27;s syndrome, and hemicrania angioparalyticia.

== Society and culture ==
Robert Shapiro, a professor of neurology, says that while cluster headaches are about as common as multiple sclerosis with a similar disability level, as of 2013, the US National Institutes of Health had spent $1.872 billion on research into multiple sclerosis in one decade, but less than $2 million on cluster headache research in 25 years.

== Research directions ==
Some case reports suggest that ingesting tryptamines such as LSD, psilocybin (as found in hallucinogenic mushrooms), or DMT can abort attacks and interrupt cluster headache cycles. The hallucinogen DMT has a chemical structure that is similar to the triptan sumatriptan, indicating a possible shared mechanism in preventing or stopping migraine and TACs. In a 2006 survey of 53 individuals, 18 of 19 psilocybin users reported extended remission periods. The survey was not a blinded or a controlled study, and was &quot;limited by recall and selection bias&quot;. The safety and efficacy of psilocybin is currently being studied in cluster headache, with the extension phase of one randomized controlled trial demonstrating reduced cluster attack burden after a 3-dose pulse of psilocybin.

Fremanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against calcitonin gene-related peptides alpha and beta, was in phase 3 clinical trials for cluster headaches, but the studies were stopped early due to a futility analysis demonstrating that a successful outcome was unlikely.

<text>Arad ( ) is a city in the Southern District of Israel. It is located on the border of the Negev and the Judaean deserts, west of the Dead Sea and east of Beersheba. The city is home to a diverse population of in , including Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (both secular and religious), Bedouins and Black Hebrews, as well as new immigrants.

After attempts to settle the area in the 1920s, Arad was founded in November 1962 as an Israeli development town, the first planned city in Israel. Arad&#x27;s population grew significantly with the Aliyah from the former Soviet Union. It became a city in 1995.

Landmarks in Arad include the ruins of Tel Arad, Arad Park, a domestic airfield and Israel&#x27;s first legal race circuit. The city is known for its annual summer music festival, the Arad Festival.

==History==

===Antiquity===

Arad is named after the Biblical Bronze Age Canaanite and later Israelite town located at Tel Arad (a Biblical archaeology site famous for the discovery of ostraca), which is located approximately west of modern Arad.

The Bible (Judges 1:16) describes it as a Canaanite stronghold whose king kept the Israelites from moving from the Negev to the Judean Mountains, although Tel Arad was destroyed over 1,200 years before the arrival of the Israelites. However, Shoshenq I&#x27;s chronicles seem to mention a settlement in Tel Arad. After its destruction during the Canaanite era, the town lay abandoned for centuries before being resettled by the Israelites from the 11th century BCE onward. The Israelites initially settled it as an unwalled piece of land cut off as an official or sacred domain was established on the upper hill. It was later a garrison-town known as &quot;The Citadel&quot;. The citadel and sanctuary are believed to have been constructed at the time of Kings David and Solomon. Artifacts found within the sanctuary of the citadel mostly reflect offerings of oil, wine, wheat, etc. brought there by numerous people during the time of the Kingdom of Judah, up to Judah&#x27;s fall to the Babylonians.

Under the Judaean kings, the citadel was periodically refortified, remodeled and rebuilt, until ultimately it was destroyed between 597 BCE and 577 BCE whilst Jerusalem was under siege by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. However, during the Persian, Hasmonean, Roman, and early Muslim eras, locals continued to transport these items to the sacred precinct of the upper hill. Markers of these ancient Israelite rituals remain to this day, with broken pottery littering the entire site.

During the Byzantine period, the location was still correctly identified by Eusebius. Nomadic Bedouins preserved the name &quot;Arad&quot; for 1,100 years, even as the site remained uninhabited.

Ancient Arad became a Christian bishopric. Stephanus, one of its bishops, was a signatory of the synodal letter of John III of Jerusalem against Severus of Antioch in 518 and took part in the 536 synod of the three Roman provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, and Palaestina Salutaris (to the last of which Arad belonged) against Anthimus I of Constantinople. No longer a residential bishopric, Arad is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

===British Mandate era===
The first modern attempt to settle the area was made by the Yishuv, the body of Jewish residents in Mandatory Palestine, on 23 February 1921, when the British Mandate government allowed discharged soldiers from the Jewish Legion to settle in the area. Nine men and two women attempted the task, but after four months were forced to leave because water was not found in the area.

===State of Israel===

On 15 November 1960, a planning team, followed by a full-fledged committee on 29 December, was appointed by the Israeli cabinet to examine the possibility of establishing a city in the northeastern Negev desert and Arad region. An initial budget of IL50,000 was granted for the project, headed by Aryeh (&quot;Lova&quot;) Eliav. On 31 January 1961, the final location was chosen ( southwest of Mount Kidod), and plans were approved for roads and water connections. In March 1961, blueprints for a city of 10,000- 20,000 residents were drawn up. Yona Pitelson was the chief architect and planner.

The plan took into account topography and climate, with residential buildings constructed with large inner courtyards that offered protection from the desert sun and wind. High density residential areas were built first in order to create an urban milieu and shorten walking distances.
The oil company Nefta built a work camp in the area in July 1961, consisting of six temporary sheds, after oil was found there in commercial quantities. The town itself was established in 1962 by a group of young ex-kibbutz and ex-moshav members seeking an environment free of overcrowding, traffic, noise, and pollution. The founding ceremony was held on 21 November, and attended by then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. It was one of the last development towns to be founded. According to the city website, Arad was the first pre-planned city in Israel.

Until 1964 Arad had about 160 families, most of whom were natives. After 1971 Arad began absorbing &quot;olim&quot; (Jewish immigrants), mostly from the Soviet Union, but also from English speaking countries and Latin America, and its population increased from 4,000 in 1969 to 10,500 in 1974 and 12,400 in 1983. During the first half of the 1990s, Arad absorbed 6,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union. In 1995, the city had 20,900 residents. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared Arad a city on 29 June 1995.

==Geography==

Arad is located mostly on the western and southwestern Kidod Range, and the Arad Plain, which marks the southwestern end of the Judean Desert. It is located west of the southern end of the Dead Sea, and is by road, east of Beersheva, south of Jerusalem, south east of Tel Aviv, and north of the southernmost city of Eilat.

The city spans an area of , one of the largest municipal areas in Israel, even though its urban area is much smaller. In 1993, the city&#x27;s jurisdiction was , still many times larger than the urban area. The historical site of Tel Arad and the Arad Park (also known as Ran Grove) can also be found within its municipal area, west of the urban core. Arad also has a commercial landing strip located slightly to the south of its urban core. It borders the Tamar and Abu Basma regional councils, and the closest local municipality to Arad is the Bedouin local council Kuseife.

==Neighborhoods==

Each neighborhood in Arad contains streets named in a thematic manner, for example, a neighborhood where all streets are named after jewels. The exception to this are the four central quarters, which have more conventional street names, and the original two neighborhoods (Rishonim and Ne&#x27;urim). The themed neighborhoods make up the entire city north of Highway 31. South of the highway is Arad&#x27;s industrial zone (the northern area being the light industry zone). The neighborhoods are as follows:

==Geology and topography==

The western part of Arad is made up of Loess land, while the eastern part is made up of sedimentary rock, including chalk, flint and dolomite.

Arad&#x27;s elevation ranges between approximately above sea level, a notable peak being Mount Kidod (), located at the northeastern point of the city and named after Ras al-Kadadeh, the Arabic name for the hill. Other peaks within the municipal borders include Mount Kina () and Mount Brir (). There are several wadis that pass through Arad, notably the Ye&#x27;elim Stream (which runs along Highway 31) and Tze&#x27;elim Stream. Others include the Hesed, Keisan, Kidod, Kina, Malhata, Pra&#x27;im, Tavya, and other streams.

==Climate==

Between 1964 and 1974, Arad&#x27;s average temperature in January was , and in July. The average yearly precipitation between 1960 and 1990 was , and between 1962 and 1978. Arad is thus situated in an arid area, where most precipitation falls in the winter months of December, January and February. It does however, on rare occasions, snow. Two examples are the massive snowstorm during the 1991–92 winter that swept through entire mountainous region of the Negev and January&#x27;s snowstorm of 2008.

According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, of Arad&#x27;s 24,400 2015 population, 80.3% were Jews, and another 16.8% were other non-Arabs. 11,900 (~48.8%) were men and 12,500 were women. 33.8% (the second highest in the country) were immigrants since 1990. Arad&#x27;s population peaked in 2002 at 24,500. Arad&#x27;s former mayor, Moty Brill, said that the reason for the city&#x27;s decline is its failure to absorb the massive immigration from Russia. In early 2007, a study ordered by the Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry found that Arad suffered from a negative image, and described it a &quot;settlement that drives residents away&quot;.

In 2015, Arad had 10,983 (~45%) salaried workers and 529 (~2.2%) self-employed. 11,805 were receiving children&#x27;s benefits, 321 were receiving unemployment benefits, and 1,168 were receiving income guarantee. The average monthly income for self-employed workers was NIS 6,934, with salaried employees earning an average of NIS 6,988 (NIS 9,008 for men and NIS 5,184 for women).

The IDF&#x27;s City of Training Bases, under construction near Beersheba, hopes to bring thousands of soldiers (mostly officers, senior NCOs and other staff) to live in the Negev, including Arad. According to Orli Yehezkel, CEO of the Ministry for the Development of the Negev and Galilee, said NIS 4.5 million will be invested in Arad, including a subsidy of NIS 1,000 per family per month for two years for families of soldiers wishing to move to Arad.

The Negev and Galilee Development Ministry envisions a tripling of Arad&#x27;s population by 2025.

==Economy==

Other than tourist venues, Arad&#x27;s commerce is mostly concentrated in the central commerce area, as envisioned in the original plan. There is one shopping mall in the city, the Arad Mall, in the northern block of the commerce sector. In addition to the main area, there are small shop clusters in most neighborhoods in the city, notably a building called The Star (&quot;HaKokhav&quot;) in the Tlalim quarter. A lone supermarket outside the center, Mega in the city, is located in the industrial zone, near the entrance to the city, and a major shopping complex is planned near it by a real estate company called Zim Centers. The Arad Market, open on Mondays, is located in the light industry zone.

Among the companies with manufacturing plants in Arad are Arad Textile Industries, one of Israel&#x27;s largest producers of towels, Flextronics Israel, El-Ran Timber Industries, Jordael who manufacture cosmetic products, and a Unilever Shefa Israel cereal plant.

A.M.S. Electronics is manufacturing printed circuit boards and electronic products. One of Israels main defence companys, Elbit Systems is manufacturing Communications Systems at a production site in Arad. In 2017 Elbit became a new order for SDR Radios from the than Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMoD) and expected to enlarge the facility.

Since 1971, Arad has been producing phosphoric acid, made from brine collected from the Dead Sea, and phosphates from the nearby Tzefa. Rotem Amfert Negev Ltd, a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL), has been planning a new phosphate plant in the Sdeh Brir area for several years. In 2008, the Ministry of the Environment decided not to contest the company&#x27;s bid, despite studies showing it may increase air pollution-related deaths in the area.

==Tourism==
In addition to the annual music festival, Arad&#x27;s fresh air attracts asthmatics from all over the world, and its proximity to the Dead Sea provides a less expensive accommodation alternative to the pricey hotel zone on the sea shore. The Arad municipality has begun to develop hiking and ecological tourism. Additionally, many visitors to Masada stay in Arad, which is the closest ( by road) urban settlement to the site and provides the only access to its western side. On the outskirts of Arad, near the hotel area, there is a large white monument conceived by Yigal Tumarkin in 1968, called &quot;Mitzpe Mo&#x27;av&quot; (Mo&#x27;av Lookout), which also offers a view of the Judean Desert.

The Israel National Trail passes through Arad, between Mount Kina and Tel Arad, a major archeological site and national park. Although not located within Arad&#x27;s jurisdiction, the Zohar Peak () and Zohar Lookout (&quot;Mitzpe Zohar&quot;) are common hiking and biking destinations on the national trail. The trails codenamed 11335 and 11240 run along the national trail in this area.

==Culture ==
Arad&#x27;s main cultural center is the Center for Culture, Youth and Sports (, &quot;Matnas&quot;), named after Samuel Rubin and located on Ben Yair Street near the Arad Mall. It was built in 1983 and contains the Arad Museum, Arad&#x27;s public library, a concert hall and the Arad Visitor Center, founded in 1989.

The Oron movie theater designed by the architect Menachem Cohen closed during the tenure of Mayor Moty Brill. Eshet Lot, an artists quarter, is located in the city&#x27;s industrial zone, utilizing old warehouses. The city also has a conservatory and concert hall.

In 2007, the Ministry for the Development of the Negev and Galilee proposed moving the national archive of Israel from Jerusalem to Arad and opening a museum.

Arad was known for its annual music festival, first held in 1982. It was a popular event and a major magnet for artists until 1995. On 18 July 1995, three teenagers were crushed to death by a falling gate during a farewell concert by the band Mashina. Despite the festival organizers&#x27; attempts to keep the festival going it was cut short. Five of the festival&#x27;s organizers received prison sentences of up to one year.

The main public park and picnic area is Arad Park, also called the Ran Grove (after Ran Schochat, who was killed in the Yom Kippur War), which is located about west of the city center and measures . Other notable parks include:
*&quot;Gan HaPsalim&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Park HaNsharim&quot;), the park at the entrance to the city, with monuments of various desert animals
*&quot;Gan HaHamisha&quot; (Garden of the Five), a memorial park for the five residents of Arad who were killed in action in the Six-Day War. Includes a monument for the soldiers, as well as a stone structure called &quot;Amud HaBulbusim&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; Pillar of the Potatoes, because of its shape), which marks Arad&#x27;s place in the desert and their residents&#x27; control of the territory according to Bedouin tradition – designed by Yona Pitelson.
*Northern Park, to the north of the Halamish neighborhood
*&quot;Gan Harpatka&#x27;ot&quot; (Adventure Park), a large playground and open grass area in the Rishonim neighborhood

The main cluster of recreational facilities is located in the Ayanot neighborhood also called Kiryat HaSport. Facilities include a swimming pool, tennis courts, a country club and playgrounds. The city&#x27;s main football stadium is located nearby on the corner of Yehuda and Palmach Streets. The stadium is home to Hapoel Arad, which plays in Liga Bet, the fourth tier of Israeli football.

Since 2000, Arad also hosts an annual mountain biking tournament, Riding Arad, in memory of Itamar Ilya, a soldier killed in action in Lebanon in 1997. In March 2008, the tournament became part of an international Union Cycliste Internationale competition, which is co-hosted by Misgav and Ma&#x27;alot. Arad&#x27;s professional course is long, while the expert course is .

==Healthcare==
Arad does not have a hospital, but there are numerous medical clinics, including &quot;Clalit&quot;, &quot;Leumit&quot; and &quot;Maccabi&quot;. Emergencies are handled by the single Magen David Adom station, located in the municipal compound.

A medical center was also built in the compound in 2004, named Schaller Medical Centre after Leon and Freda Schaller from London, who were the prime donors. It serves as an emergency ward, but does not have the equipment needed to perform operations, and such patients are transferred to the Soroka Medical Center. On average, 10% of the patients are transferred.

==Law enforcement==
Arad is served by a local Israel Police station, located next to the municipal compound and the Magen David Adom station. It is commanded by Chief Superintendent Danny Kedoshim. Arad&#x27;s station also serves the Sodom area.

Arad&#x27;s police force was chosen as the exceptional force for 2007, and awarded an award of excellence on 5 March 2008. Among others, a severe reduction in property crime was cited. Arad&#x27;s force was able to reduce the number of such crimes from 1,092 in 2003 to just 168 in 2007. On 18 July 2008, Arad police, in a rare incident, shot dead a man threatening to kill his ex-wife with a knife.

==Education and religious institutions==
Arad has a public elementary school in every central neighborhood (Tlalim, Avishur, Leva&#x27;ot and Ye&#x27;elim), while Tlalim is a religious school. There is one public middle school, Re&#x27;ut, located near the junction of the Yoshiyahu and HaKana&#x27;im streets. The second middle school, Allon, was closed in 2007 and merged into ORT Arad, the city&#x27;s only public secondary school, which shares a building with the Re&#x27;ut middle school and the former Yigal Allon school. In the 2021–22 school year, 71.9% of Arad&#x27;s 12th graders were eligible for a &quot;Bagrut&quot; (matriculation) certificate, compared to a national average of 75.9%.

In addition, there are several private and Haredi schools in Arad, such as the Shuvu movement&#x27;s grades 1–8 school, and the Gerrer Haredi school. Other Haredi schools include the boys&#x27; Beit Ya&#x27;akov and girls&#x27; Kol Ya&#x27;akov in the Halamish neighborhood, the Lev Simcha Yeshiva, and the Beit Ya&#x27;akov High School. Religious Zionist schools include the Ne&#x27;ot Avraham Bnei Akiva Ulpana, which also provides young women with the guidance to perform volunteer activities in the community, and the Tlalim Elementary School, founded in 1971.
SOS Children&#x27;s Village Arad (known as &quot;Kfar Neradim&quot;) was built in the southern outskirts of Arad and inaugurated on 27 October 1981. It consists of twelve family houses, to accommodate up to 120 children. There is also an SOS Youth Facility to accommodate 12 to 14 youths from the SOS Children&#x27;s Village. In January 2005, an SOS Social Centre was opened at Arad. It runs a day-care center and various community outreach programmes to support socially weak families. Until fall 2008, the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS), funded by Jews from New Jersey, had an institute in Arad which allowed post-college young Jews from around the world to study Israeli society and the Hebrew language. When WUJS&#x27;s ownership changed, the institute was moved to the center of the country.

Arad has 22 synagogues, of which 11 are Ashkenazi, 9 are Sephardi, one is Yemenite, and one is Ethiopian. Both the central Ashkenazi and Sephardi synagogues are located in the Ye&#x27;elim neighborhood. A Masorti synagogue, Shira Hadasha is in the Rishonim neighborhood. There are Gerrer synagogues in Avishur and Halamish, and a Chabad synagogue in Ye&#x27;elim. There are two &quot;mikvehs&quot; in the city–in the Tlalim and Ayanot neighborhoods. The city also has a small Messianic community that is being accused of illegal missionary activities by the Haredim and certain right-wing groups. Arad&#x27;s dead are mostly buried in the local cemetery, located in the northeastern outskirts of the city, close to the road to Masada.

==Media==
Arad&#x27;s local newspaper, &quot;Kidod&quot;, was published by the entrepreneurs Eli and Rochale Ziv, early founders of Arad. &quot;Kidod&quot; started as a small leaflet in December 1966 and grew to a become a full paper. At its peak, it was circulated, free of charge, in groceries, kiosks, etc., in 3,000 copies each week. &quot;Kidod&quot; ran for 23 years and had a key role in the cultural and community life of Arad. &quot;HaTzvi Arad&quot; is the local newspaper today.

==Transportation==

Arad is reached by Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad&#x27;s municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada&#x27;s western side.

Arad&#x27;s airfield, first used during the music festival of 1994, is located south of the city, and serves domestic flights according to demand. In May 2017, a new railway line to Arad via Kuseife was approved. The line will connect to the existing Beersheba-Dimona rail line at Nevatim. Its terminus will be adjacent to the central bus station.

Arad Central Bus Station, once located on the corner of Yerushalayim Street and Yehuda Street was closed due to a legal battle between the municipality and the Egged Bus Cooperative. A new station was subsequently built with five platforms and a park and ride lot.

Until 2007 the municipal buses were served by Egged Bus Cooperative. But in 2007 Ministry of Transport and Road Safety decided to give the Negev zone tender to Metropoline. Since 01/06/2007 Municipal bus lines are served by Metropoline. Inter City Buses in Arad are served by the Egged Bus Cooperative and Metropoline. A multitude of inter-city bus routes are served by the main station, two more inter-city Haredi routes which leave from the north, as well as five inner routes (1, 2, 3, 11, 12). The municipal and inter-city routes are :

==Local government==
Arad has, since its inception in 1962, been under the governance of a regional council and local council, before being designated as a city council in 1995. Democratic elections have been held in Arad since 1966, although only Avraham Shochat, Betzalel Tabib and Moty Brill were ever elected or re-elected as the head of the municipality. The first mayor of the city of Arad was Betzalel Tabib who served as both head of the local council and city council. He was replaced by Mordechai Brill in 2003, although due to his inability to pass a yearly budget, Brill was dismissed by the Minister of the Interior Meir Sheetrit in August 2007, and a government-appointed clerk, Gideon Bar-Lev, took his place. An election took place again 13 April 2010, won by Tali Ploskov of the Yisrael Beiteinu party. The longest serving head of Arad&#x27;s municipality was Avraham Shochat who served as head of the local council between 1967 and 1986.

Arad&#x27;s yearly budget is over 100 million NIS and over $30 million USD. On 27 December 2007, the 2008 budget was unanimously passed at NIS 123 million by the city council. The city&#x27;s total income for the year is estimated at NIS 119 million.

While it is not customary for Israeli cities to have major unique/auxiliary laws, many cities have minor laws. In Arad, it is illegal to feed animals in public places. It is also illegal to sell or consume sunflower seeds, peanuts, etc. in public places, due to an anti-littering law enacted in 1965. There are in all 27 auxiliary laws in Arad, which were enacted between 1965 and 2000.

===Municipal flag and emblem===

The emblem of Arad is a square with a hill and a flame. The hill represents Mount Kidod, a hill in the northeastern part of the city, and the flame represents natural gas, which was extracted in the area in Arad&#x27;s early days and spurred the city&#x27;s growth. The emblem was adopted on 19 May 1966. The flag of Arad is a rectangle with a 2:3 ratio, which has a light blue background and shows the emblem in the center with the Hebrew text for &quot;Municipality of Arad&quot; at the top and the English text &quot;City of ARAD Israel&quot; (or variations thereof) and the bottom. This is the de facto flag, and there is no law or edict making it official.

==Notable people==

*Amos Oz (1939–2018), writer
*Ruth Dorrit Yacoby(1952-2015) ,painter and poet.

* Dinslaken, Germany signed a twinning agreement with Arad in 1989.
* Burlington, Vermont developed a sister city relationship with Arad in 1991.

<doc id="310437" wikidata="Q856383" url="?curid=310437" title="Pictish language">
<text>Pictish is an extinct Brittonic Celtic language spoken by the Picts, the people of eastern and northern Scotland from late antiquity to the Early Middle Ages. Virtually no direct attestations of Pictish remain, short of a limited number of geographical and personal names found on monuments and early medieval records in the area controlled by the kingdoms of the Picts. Such evidence, however, shows the language to be an Insular Celtic language related to the Brittonic language then spoken in most of the rest of Britain.

The prevailing view in the second half of the 20th century was that Pictish was a non-Indo-European language isolate, or that a non-Indo-European Pictish and Brittonic Pictish language coexisted.

Pictish was replaced by – or subsumed into – Gaelic in the latter centuries of the Pictish period. During the reign of Donald II of Scotland (889–900), outsiders began to refer to the region as the kingdom of Alba rather than the kingdom of the Picts. However, the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly. A process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly under way during the reigns of Donald II and his successors. By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and the Pictish identity was forgotten.

==Language classification==

The existence of a distinct Pictish language during the Early Middle Ages is attested clearly in Bede&#x27;s early eighth-century &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, which names Pictish as a language distinct from those spoken by the Britons, the Irish, and the English. Bede states that Columba, a Gael, used an interpreter during his mission to the Picts. A number of competing theories have been advanced regarding the nature of the Pictish language: 
* Pictish was an insular Celtic language allied to the P-Celtic language Brittonic (descendants Welsh, Cornish, Cumbric, and Breton). 
* Pictish was an insular Celtic language allied to the Q-Celtic (Goidelic) languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx). 
* Pictish was one of the Pre-Indo-European languages, a relic of the Bronze Age.

Most modern scholars agree that the ancestor of the Pictish language, spoken at the time of the Roman conquest, was a branch of the Brittonic language, while a few scholars accept that it was merely &quot;related&quot; to the Brittonic language. Thomas Charles-Edwards argues that there was a common language in north Briton in the early Roman period, and that the Pictish language developed as a consequence of the emergence of the Pictish confederation in the late third century. Pictish came under increasing influence from the Goidelic language spoken in Dál Riata from the eighth century until its eventual replacement.

Pictish is thought to have influenced the development of modern Scottish Gaelic. This is perhaps most obvious in the contribution of loan words, but, more importantly, Pictish is thought to have influenced the syntax of Scottish Gaelic, which is more similar to Brittonic languages than to Irish.

Some commentators have noted that, in light of the disparate nature of the surviving evidence and large geographical area in which it was spoken, that Pictish may have represented not a single language, but rather a number of discrete Brittonic varieties.
===Position within Celtic===
The evidence of place names and personal names demonstrates that an insular Celtic language related to the more southerly Brittonic languages was formerly spoken in the Pictish area. The view of Pictish as a P-Celtic language was first proposed in 1582 by George Buchanan, who aligned the language with Gaulish. A compatible view was advanced by antiquarian George Chalmers in the early 19th century. Chalmers considered that Pictish and Brittonic were one and the same, basing his argument on P-Celtic orthography in the Pictish king lists and in place names predominant in historically Pictish areas.

Although demonstrably Celtic-speaking, the exact linguistic affinity of the Roman-era predecessors to the Picts is difficult to securely establish. The personal name &quot;Vepogeni&quot;, recorded c. 230 AD, implies that P-Celtic was spoken by at least the Caledonians.
Celtic scholar Whitley Stokes, in a philological study of the Irish annals, concluded that Pictish was closely related to Welsh. This conclusion was supported by philologist Alexander MacBain&#x27;s analysis of the place and tribe names in Ptolemy&#x27;s second-century &quot;Geographia&quot;. Toponymist William Watson&#x27;s exhaustive review of Scottish place names demonstrated convincingly the existence of a dominant P-Celtic language in historically Pictish areas, concluding that the Pictish language was a northern extension of British and that Gaelic was a later introduction from Ireland.

William Forbes Skene argued in 1837 that Pictish was a Goidelic language, the ancestor of modern Scottish Gaelic. He suggested that Columba&#x27;s use of an interpreter reflected his preaching to the Picts in Latin, rather than any difference between the Irish and Pictish languages. This view, involving independent settlement of Ireland and Scotland by Goidelic people, obviated an Irish influence in the development of Gaelic Scotland and enjoyed wide popular acceptance in 19th-century Scotland.

Skene later revised his view of Pictish, noting that it appeared to share elements of both Goidelic and Brittonic:
 The Picts were under increasing political, social, and linguistic influence from Dál Riata from around the eighth century. The Picts were steadily gaelicised through the latter centuries of the Pictish kingdom, and by the time of the merging of the Pictish and Dál Riatan kingdoms, the Picts were essentially a Gaelic-speaking people. Forsyth speculates that a period of bilingualism may have outlasted the Pictish kingdom in peripheral areas by several generations. Scottish Gaelic, unlike Irish, maintains a substantial corpus of Brittonic loan-words and, moreover, uses a verbal system modelled on the same pattern as Welsh.

The traditional Q-Celtic vs P-Celtic model, involving separate migrations of P-Celtic and Q-Celtic speaking settlers into the British Isles, is one of mutual unintelligibility, with the Irish Sea serving as the frontier between the two. However, it is likely that the Insular Celtic languages evolved from a more-or-less unified proto-Celtic language within the British Isles. Divergence between P-Celtic Pictish and Q-Celtic Dalriadan Goidelic was slight enough to allow Picts and Dalriadans to understand each other&#x27;s language to some degree. Under this scenario, a gradual linguistic convergence is conceivable and even probable given the presence of the Columban Church in Pictland.

===Pre-Indo-European hypothesis===

In 1892, John Rhys proposed that Pictish was a non-Indo-European language. This opinion was based on the apparently unintelligible ogham inscriptions found in historically Pictish areas (compare ). A similar position was taken by Heinrich Zimmer, who argued that the Picts&#x27; supposedly exotic cultural practices (tattooing and matriliny) were equally non-Indo-European, and a pre-Indo-European model was maintained by some well into the 20th century.

A modified version of this theory was advanced in an influential 1955 review of Pictish by Kenneth Jackson, who proposed a two-language model: while Pictish was undoubtedly P-Celtic, it may have had a non-Celtic substratum and a second language may have been used for inscriptions. Jackson&#x27;s hypothesis was framed in the then-current model that a Brittonic elite, identified as the Broch-builders, had migrated from the south of Britain into Pictish territory, dominating a pre-Celtic majority. He used this to reconcile the perceived translational difficulties of Ogham with the overwhelming evidence for a P-Celtic Pictish language. Jackson was content to write off Ogham inscriptions as inherently unintelligible.

Jackson&#x27;s model became the orthodox position for the latter half of the 20th century. However, it became progressively undermined by advances in understanding of late Iron Age archaeology. Celtic interpretations have been suggested for a number of Ogham inscriptions in recent years, though this remains a matter of debate.

===Other discredited theories===
Traditional accounts (now rejected) claimed that the Picts had migrated to Scotland from Scythia, a region that encompassed Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Buchanan, looking for a Scythian P-Celtic candidate for the ancestral Pict, settled on the Gaulish-speaking Cotini (which he rendered as &quot;Gothuni&quot;), a tribe from the region that is now Slovakia. This was later misunderstood by Robert Sibbald in 1710, who equated &quot;Gothuni&quot; with the Germanic-speaking &quot;Goths&quot;. John Pinkerton expanded on this in 1789, claiming that Pictish was the predecessor to modern Scots. Pinkerton&#x27;s arguments were often rambling, bizarre and clearly motivated by his belief that Celts were an inferior people. The theory of a Germanic Pictish language is no longer considered credible.

== Attestations ==
=== Ogham inscriptions ===
Although the interpretation of over 40 Ogham inscriptions remains uncertain, several have been acknowledged to contain Brittonic forms, although Rodway (2020) has disputed this. Guto Rhys (2015) notes that significant caution is required in the interpretation of such inscriptions because crucial information, such as the orthographic key, the linguistic context in which they were composed and the extent of literacy in Pictland, remains unknown. 

An Ogham inscription at the Broch of Burrian, Orkney has been transliterated as . Broken up as , this may reveal a Pictish cognate of Old Welsh &#x27;he/she made&#x27; in . (The only direct continuation in Middle Welsh is 1sg. &lt; &quot;*u̯rakt-ū&quot; in the poem known as &quot;Peis Dinogat&quot; in the Book of Aneirin; this form was eventually reformed to &quot;gwnaeth&quot;.) With the fourth word explained as spirantized Pictish &#x27;cross&#x27; (Welsh &lt; Latin ) and the corrupted first word a personal name, the inscription may represent a Pictish sentence explaining who carved the cross.

The Shetland inscriptions at Cunningsburgh and Lunnasting reading and have been understood as Brittonic expressions meaning &quot;this is as great&quot; and &quot;this is as far&quot;, respectively, messages appropriate for boundary stones.

Transliterated as , it is possible that the Brandsbutt Stone inscription attests a Pictish form cognate with Old Breton , &quot;he lies&quot;, in &quot;IRA-&quot;, occurring at the Lomarec inscription in Brittany.

=== Place names ===
Pictish toponyms occur in Scotland north of the River Forth. Distributed from Fife to the Isle of Skye, they are relatively abundant south of the Dornoch Firth but rare in the extreme north.

Many principal settlements and geographical features of the region bear names of Pictish origin, including:
*Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire. Meaning &quot;mouth of the River Don&quot; (cf. Welsh , &quot;estuary, confluence&quot;).
*Cupar, Fife. Meaning &quot;confluence&quot; (cf. Welsh ).
*Keith, Banffshire. Meaning &quot;forest&quot; (cf. Welsh ).
*Kirkcaldy, Fife. Meaning &quot;place of the hard fort&quot; from &quot;caer&quot;, &quot;fort&quot; and &quot;caled&quot;, &quot;hard&quot;.
*Perth, Perthshire. Meaning &quot;wood, grove&quot; (cf. Welsh ).
*Yell, Shetland. Meaning &quot;unfruitful land&quot; (cf. Welsh &quot;iâl&quot;).

Several Pictish elements occur multiple times in the region. This table lists selected instances according to the Welsh equivalent.

Some Pictish names have been succeeded by Gaelic forms, and in certain instances the earlier forms appear on historical record.
*Inverbervie, Kincardineshire. &quot;Haberberui&quot; in 1290, demonstrates that a Pictish &quot;aber&quot;, &quot;estuary, confluence&quot; has been supplanted by Gaelic &quot;inbhir&quot;, with identical meaning.
*Inverie, Fife. A possible early form, &quot;Auerin&quot; (1141), may be for &quot;*Aberin&quot;, thus attesting the same &quot;inbhir&quot; for &quot;aber&quot; substitution as above.
*Kindrochit Alian, Aberdeenshire. &quot;Doldauha&quot; before c. 850 AD, in which the first element is &quot;dôl&quot; (&quot;meadow&quot;).
*Strathtyrum, Fife. &quot;Trestirum&quot; in 1190, suggestive of assimilation of a Pictish &quot;tref&quot;, &quot;estate&quot;, to (unconnected) Gaelic &quot;srath&quot;, &quot;a valley&quot;.

=== Personal names ===
Pictish personal names, as acquired from documents such as the Poppleton manuscript, show significant diagnostically Brittonic features including the retention of final &quot;-st&quot; and initial &quot;w-&quot; (cf. P. &quot;Uurgust&quot; vs. Goidelic &quot;Fergus&quot;) as well as development of &quot;-ora-&quot; to &quot;-ara-&quot; (cf. P. &quot;Taran&quot; vs G. &quot;torann&quot;).

Several Pictish names are directly parallel to names and nouns in other Brittonic languages. Several Pictish names are listed below according to their equivalents in Brittonic and other Celtic languages.

Several elements common in forming Brittonic names also appear in the names of Picts. These include &quot;*jʉð&quot;, &quot;lord&quot; (&gt; &quot;Ciniod&quot;) and &quot;*res&quot;, &quot;ardor&quot; (&gt; &quot;Resad&quot;; cf. Welsh &quot;Rhys&quot;).

=== Irish records ===
The 9th century work &quot;Sanas Cormaic&quot; (or Cormac&#x27;s Gloassary), an etymological glossary of Irish, noted a word &quot;catait&quot; (&quot;Pictish brooch&quot;) (also spelled &quot;cartait&quot; and &quot;catit&quot;) as being of Pictish origin. Isaac (2005) compared the word with Old Welsh &quot;cathet&quot; (of uncertain meaning but thought to mean &quot;brooch&quot; and appearing in a 10th century poem listing precious gifts) and offered a speculative Pictish reconstruction &quot;*kazdet&quot;.

== Influence on Gaelic ==
Etymological investigation of the Scottish Gaelic language, in particular the 1896 efforts of Alexander Macbain, has demonstrated the presence of a corpus of Pictish loanwords in the language. The items most commonly cited as loanwords are &quot;bad&quot; (&quot;clump&quot;; Breton &quot;bod&quot;), &quot;bagaid&quot; (&quot;cluster, troop&quot;; Welsh &quot;bagad&quot;), &quot;dail&quot; (&quot;meadow&quot;; W &quot;dôl&quot;), &quot;dìleab&quot; (&quot;legacy&quot;), &quot;mormaer&quot; (&quot;earl&quot;; W &quot;mawr&quot; + &quot;maer&quot;), &quot;pailt&quot; (&quot;plentiful&quot;; Cornish &quot;pals&quot;), &quot;peasg&quot; (&quot;gash&quot;; W &quot;pisg&quot;), &quot;peit&quot; (&quot;area of ground, part, share&quot;; W &quot;peth&quot;), &quot;pòr&quot; (Middle Welsh &quot;paur&quot;; &quot;grain, crops&quot;), &quot;preas&quot; (&quot;bush&quot;; W &quot;prys&quot;). On the basis of a number of the loans attesting shorter vowels than other British cognates, linguist Guto Rhys proposed Pictish resisted some Latin-influenced sound changes of the 6th century. Rhys has also noted the potentially &quot;fiscal&quot; profile of several of the loans, and hypothesized that they could have entered Gaelic as a package in a governmental context.

Several Gaelic nouns have meanings more closely matching their Brittonic cognates than those in Irish, indicating that Pictish may have influenced the sense and usage of these words as a substrate. &quot;Srath&quot; (&gt; &quot;Strath-&quot;) is recorded to have meant &quot;grassland&quot; in Old Irish, whereas the modern Gaelic realization means &quot;broad valley&quot;, exactly as in its Brittonic cognates (cf. Welsh ). &quot;Dùn&quot;, &quot;foithir&quot;, &quot;lios&quot;, &quot;ràth&quot; and &quot;tom&quot; may, by the same token, attest a substrate influence from Pictish.

Greene noted that the verbal system inherited in Gaelic from Old Irish had been brought &quot;into complete conformity with that of modern spoken Welsh&quot;, and consequently Guto Rhys adjudged that Pictish may have modified Gaelic verbal syntax.

<text>Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta, Sz. 106, BB 114 is one of the best-known compositions by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. Commissioned by Paul Sacher to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the chamber orchestra &quot;Basler Kammerorchester&quot;, the score is dated 7 September 1936.

The work was premiered in Basel, Switzerland, on January 21, 1937 by the chamber orchestra conducted by Sacher, and was published the same year by Universal Edition.

==Analysis==
As its title indicates, the piece is written for string instruments (violins, violas, cellos, double basses, and harp), percussion instruments (xylophone, snare drum, cymbals, tam-tam, bass drum, and timpani) and celesta. The ensemble also includes a piano, which, due to the hammer mechanisms inside, can also be considered a percussion instrument; the celesta player joins the pianist in some four-hands passages. Bartók divides the strings into two ensembles which, he directs, should be placed antiphonally on opposite sides of the stage, and he makes use of antiphonal effects particularly in the second and fourth movements.

The piece is in four movements: the first and third slow; the second and fourth quick. All the movements are written without a key signature:
The first movement is a slow fugue with a constantly changing time signature. The movement is based around the note A, on which it begins and ends. It begins with muted strings, and as more voices enter, the texture thickens and the music becomes louder, coming to a climax on E, a tritone away from A. Mutes are then removed, and the music becomes gradually quieter over gentle celesta arpeggios. The movement ends with the second phrase of the fugue subject played softly over its inversion. The first movement can be seen as a basis for material in the later movements; the fugue subject recurs in different guises throughout the piece.

The second movement is quick, with a theme in time which is transformed into time towards the end. It is marked with a loud syncopated piano and percussion accents in a whirling dance, evolving in an extended pizzicato section, with a piano concerto-like conclusion.

The third movement is slow, an example of what is often called Bartók&#x27;s &quot;night music&quot;. It features timpani glissandi, an unusual technique at the time of the work&#x27;s composition, as well as a prominent xylophone part. The rhythm of the xylophone solo that opens the third movement is a &quot;written-out accelerando/ritardando&quot; that follows the Fibonacci sequence, the notated rhythm representing 1:1:2:3:5:8:5:3:2:1:1 notes per beat in sequence.

The fourth and final movement, which begins with notes on the timpani and strummed pizzicato chords on the strings, has the character of a lively folk dance.

==Popular culture==

The popularity of &quot;Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta&quot; is demonstrated by the use of themes from this work in films and popular music. The second movement accompanies &quot;Craig&#x27;s Dance of Despair and Disillusionment&quot; in the film &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. The Adagio was used as the theme music for &quot;The Vampira Show&quot; (1954–55). The movement was also featured in the Encyclopaedia Britannica film &quot;The Solar System&quot; (1977) and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980). Jerry Goldsmith wrote in the style of this piece for the 1962 film &quot;&quot;. It also was the soundtrack for the 1978 Australian film &quot;Money Movers&quot;. Anthony &quot;Ant&quot; Davis of the hip hop group Atmosphere samples the piece on the song &quot;Aspiring Sociopath&quot;. The first movement is used in Joanna Hogg&#x27;s 2022 film &quot;The Eternal Daughter&quot;.

The architect Steven Holl used the overlapping &quot;strettos&quot; in this piece as a model for the form of the Stretto House (1989) in Dallas, Texas.

The novel &quot;City of Night&quot; (1962) by John Rechy makes reference to &quot;Music for Strings Percussion and Celesta&quot;, a work that haunts the main character. The piece is also mentioned in John Fowles&#x27;s novel &quot;The Collector&quot;; one of the main characters, Miranda Grey, calls it &quot;The loveliest.&quot;

Much of the music from this collection, along with &quot;The Miraculous Mandarin&quot;, can be heard as underscore for two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories: 1967&#x27;s &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; and 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;.

<text>In botany, a capsule is a type of simple, dry, though rarely fleshy dehiscent fruit produced by many species of angiosperms (flowering plants).

== Origins and structure ==
The capsule (Latin: &quot;capsula&quot;, small box) is derived from a compound (multicarpellary) ovary. A capsule is a structure composed of two or more carpels. In (flowering plants), the term locule (or cell) is used to refer to a chamber within the fruit. Depending on the number of locules in the ovary, fruit can be classified as uni-locular (unilocular), bi-locular, tri-locular or multi-locular. The number of locules present in a gynoecium may be equal to or less than the number of carpels. The locules contain the ovules or seeds and are separated by septa.

== Dehiscence ==

In most cases the capsule is dehiscent, i.e. at maturity, it splits apart (dehisces) to release the seeds within. A few capsules are indehiscent, for example those of &quot;Adansonia digitata&quot;, &quot;Alphitonia&quot;, and &quot;Merciera&quot;. Capsules are often classified into four types, depending on the type and location of dehiscence (see Simpson Fig 9.41 and Hickey &amp; King ).
Loculicidal capsules possess longitudinal lines of dehiscence radially aligned with the locules, &quot;i.e.&quot; not at the septa, along the midrib or dorsal suture (seam) of the locules. If septa are absent, the dehiscence lines lie between the placentae. This type is common among many members of the Liliaceae such as Lilium (see illustration).

Septicidal capsules have dehiscence lines aligned with the sutures of the ovary septa or placentae, that is between the carpels.

Both loculicidal and septicidal capsules split into distinguishable segments called valves. The valves are a part of the pericarp (fruit wall) that has split away, without enclosing the seed or seeds. The borders of the valves may or may not coincide with the borders of carpels. These valves may remain attached to the fruit or fall off. In septicidal capsules the valves remain in place. In some capsules, the split occurs between carpels, and in others each carpel splits open.

Circumscissile capsules (pyxide, pyxis, pyxidium or lid capsule) have a transverse, rather than longitudinal, dehiscence line, so that the upper part of the capsule dehisces, usually forming a terminal lid (operculum) that opens (see illustration). An example is &quot;Plantago&quot;. A variant is the Septifragal capsule (valvular capsule) in which the outer walls break away from the septa and (usually axile) placentae as valves.

Poricidal capsules dehisce through pores (openings) in the capsule, as in &quot;Papaver&quot;, the seeds escaping through these pores.

Examples of other plants that produce capsules include nigella, orchid, willow, cotton, and jimson weed.

== Specialised capsules ==

Some dry dehiscent fruits form specialised capsule-like structures. A follicle is derived from a single carpel that splits along a suture, as in &quot;Magnolia&quot;, while a legume splits along two sutures, and are a defining feature of the Fabaceae. Some variants of legumes that have retained vestigial sutures include loments that split transversely into segments, each with a single seed, and indehiscent legumes, such as &quot;Arachis hypogaea&quot; (peanuts). Capsules derived from two carpels include silicles and siliques that dehisce along two suture lines but retain a partition called the replum, which is a septum with attached seeds. While both are characteristic of Brassicaceae, silicles have a ratio of length to width of no more than 3:1. A schizocarp is derived from a compound ovary with two or more locules which then separate radially as one of the above types, such as a schizocarp of follicles, as in &quot;Asclepias&quot; (Asclepiadoideae) (see illustration).

A mericarp is a portion of the fruit that separates from the ovary to form a distinct locule unit which encloses the seed, usually-nut-like, as in Apiaceae in which the mericarps are joined by a stalk (carpophore). Thus a schizocarp of mericarps is a structure in which the carpels of a single ovary split to form mericarps. A schizocarp of nutlets is derived from a carpel that becomes lobed, and the lobes become nutlets that split apart. Examples include Boraginaceae and most Lamiaceae, where the styles are attached between the ovary lobes.

== Nuts ==
Capsules are sometimes mislabeled as nuts, as in the example of the Brazil nut or the Horse-chestnut. A capsule is not a nut because it releases its seeds and it splits apart. Nuts, on the other hand, do not release seeds as they are a compound ovary containing both a single seed and the fruit. Nuts also do not split. In the Brazil nut, a lid on the capsule opens, but is too small to release the dozen or so seeds (the actual &quot;Brazil nut&quot; of commerce) within. These germinate inside the capsule after it falls to the ground.

<text>Paul Sacher (28 April 190626 May 1999) was a Swiss conductor, patron and billionaire businessman. At the time of his death Sacher was majority shareholder of pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche and was considered the third richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of US$13 billion.

He founded and conducted the Basler Kammerorchester (1926–1987). He commissioned notable works of composers of the 20th century and premiered them with the chamber orchestra. While better known for his interest in new music, he was also devoted to music of baroque and classical eras; he founded the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, institute for early music, in 1933.

==Biography==
Sacher studied under Felix Weingartner, among others. In 1926 he founded the chamber orchestra Basler Kammerorchester, which specialized in both modern (twentieth-century) and pre-classical (mid-eighteenth-century) repertory. In 1928 he founded the Basel Chamber Choir. Both the orchestra and choir gave their last performance in 1987. In 1984, the Serenata Basel was formed, with no direct connection to Sacher. They later adopted the name Kammerorchester Basel. He also founded the Collegium Musicum Zürich in 1941 with Walter Schulthess and Stefi Geyer which he conducted until its disbandment in 1992.

==Personal life==
He was considered the world&#x27;s third-richest man of the 1990s after marrying the heiress of the pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche. At the time of his death, he was reputed in various publications to be the richest man in Europe. He died in 1999, aged 93.

Sacher had 3 children outside marriage, two daughters, Katharina and Cornelia, with Countess of Faber-Castell, and a son, Georg Schmid.

===Commissions===
Immensely wealthy, Sacher commissioned works from many well-known composers, including:
*Igor Stravinsky (who provided him with the Concerto in D)
*Béla Bartók (Divertimento for Strings, the Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, the String Quartet No. 6 and the &quot;Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta&quot;)
*Bohuslav Martinů (many works including the Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano, and Timpani, Concerto da camera, etc.)
*Arthur Honegger (many works, including his Second and Fourth Symphony (&quot;Deliciae Basilienses&quot;)
*Frank Martin (six works, including the &quot;Petite symphonie concertante&quot;)
*Paul Hindemith
*Hans Werner Henze
*Richard Strauss
*Elliott Carter
*Witold Lutosławski (Sacher-Variationen, Double Concerto, &quot;Chain II&quot;)
*Henri Dutilleux (&quot;Trois strophes sur le nom de Sacher&quot; and &quot;Mystère de l&#x27;instant&quot;)
*Harrison Birtwistle

Pierre Boulez wrote his Grawemeyer Award-winning work &quot;Sur Incises&quot; for Sacher&#x27;s 90th birthday. Boulez bequeathed his entire catalogue (including drafts) to the Paul Sacher Foundation. Henze dedicated his Tenth Symphony to the memory of Sacher, who had commissioned it but died before its completion.

In 1983, Sacher acquired the Stravinsky estate. The Paul Sacher Stiftung (Foundation) is located in the centre of Basel (in Münsterplatz) and houses one of the world&#x27;s most important musical-manuscript collections. Sacher bought most of these manuscripts himself, and they include complete collections by several important twentieth-century composers (including Lutosławski, Ligeti, Boulez and Reich). In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate from the Academy of Music in Kraków.

==&quot;eSACHERe&quot;==
On the occasion of Sacher&#x27;s 70th birthday, twelve composer friends of his (Conrad Beck, Luciano Berio, Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten, Henri Dutilleux, Wolfgang Fortner, Alberto Ginastera, Cristóbal Halffter, Hans Werner Henze, Heinz Holliger, Klaus Huber and Witold Lutosławski) were asked by Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich to write compositions for cello solo using his name spelled out in musical notes (musical cryptogram) as the theme (eS, A, C, H, E, Re). Many of them were performed in a Zurich concert on 2 May 1976. The whole &quot;eSACHERe&quot; project was performed in its entirety for the first time by Czech cellist František Brikcius on 9 May 2011 in Prague.
