<text>The Vulture is the alias of several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most of whom are depicted as recurring enemies of the superhero Spider-Man and part of his adversaries composing his rogues gallery, typically using special suits which allow them to fly at vast speeds.

The first incarnation of the character, Isidoro Scarlotti, is an Italian scientist and an enemy of the original Human Torch and Toro. The second and most prominent incarnation of the character, Adrian Toomes, is an inventive but maniacal genius who designed his suit and turned to a life of crime, becoming an enemy of Spider-Man and a founding member of the Sinister Six, with later characters to assume the mantle including Blackie Drago, a former cellmate of Toomes, and Clifton Shallot and Jimmy Natale, human/bird hybrids of independent origins. Toomes is later revealed to be the grandfather of the superhero Starling.

Since his conception, the character has been adapted from into various other forms of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; media, including television series and video games. In live-action, the character was played by Michael Keaton in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017) and the Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film &quot;Morbius&quot; (2022).

==Publication history==
The first Vulture, Italian scientist Isidoro Scarlotti, first appeared in &quot;Young Men&quot; #26 (December 1953), created by Joe Gill and Carl Burgos and depicted as an enemy of the original Human Torch and Toro.

The second Vulture, Adrian Toomes, first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #2 (May 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. According to Ditko, Lee wanted the villain to be heavy-set and based on actor Sydney Greenstreet. Ditko designed him to be leaner and more gaunt, feeling he should be swift and fast and also because &quot;The bulkier anything is, the more panel space it has to take up, thereby shrinking panel space for other characters and story panel elements.&quot;

Since Toomes originally assumed the Vulture alias as an enemy of Spider-Man, several other character have taken on the mantle from him. The third incarnation, Blackie Drago, first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #48 (May 1967), and was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr. Lee created the new version because he thought that Spider-Man looked like a bully fighting a wizened old man. However, the readers wrote in that they did not like the new Vulture, and Lee relented and brought the original back.

The fourth incarnation, Clifton Shallot, first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #127, and was created by Ross Andru, Gerry Conway, and John Romita Sr.

A fifth incarnation, Jimmy Natale, first appears in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #593 as part of the story arc &quot;Spider-Man 24/7&quot;; created by Mark Waid and Mike McKone, he is a recurring enemy of both Spider-Man and the Punisher.

==Fictional character biography==
===Isidoro Scarlotti===
Isidoro Scarlotti was born in Italy, attaining a doctorate in atomic science and rising to become the czar of the International League of Criminals, constructing a series &quot;super atomic bombs&quot; with which to hold the world ransom, and wearing a mechanised vulture mask. In an attempt at preventing the flaming heroes Human Torch and Toro from interfering with his plans, the Vulture builds robot duplicates of the heroes programmed to commit crimes and murders in order to discredit them; when the Torch and Toro arrive at their boss Chief Wilson&#x27;s office, they learn that the Vulture has kidnapped his daughter Mary, with his trademark Vulture plane spotted en-route to New Mexico. Following it to the Vulture&#x27;s hideout, melting through its walls, they are confronted by the Vulture, who traps them with a wall of radiation deflecting their fire powers, before fleeing the scene, leaving Mary behind to watch them die. After the radiation-proof Torch is able to save them, the Torch and Toro return to Chief Wilson&#x27;s office and stop their Vulture-made robotic duplicates from killing the Chief, before learning of the Vulture&#x27;s ransom demand to the world&#x27;s governments to surrender and rush back to his base in New Mexico, trashing his equipment. On revealing his identity, the Vulture traps the heroes in his base again, which begins to fill with acid, threatening to smother their flame. After revealing he has set the atomic pile in his base to explode, the Vulture flees, with the Torch and Toro barely able to escape in time, the Torch believing it to be far from the last they will hear of the Vulture.

The Vulture next kidnaps and kills roboticist Professor Costene in order to obtain his robot formula, using it to create a wave of crime robots, the largest of which he names Metallo. When the Torch and Toro arrive to investigate Costene&#x27;s disappearance, they encounter the Vulture&#x27;s crime robots and manage to defeat them by luring them into the swamp to be short-circuited by water. On getting to the Vulture&#x27;s hideout, they battle Metallo and free the Vulture&#x27;s hostage Betty Wilson (the chief&#x27;s other daughter) as the Vulture got away.

Later, the Vulture sabotages a testing site for a new rocket to take man to the moon, with the Torch and Toro learning he has constructed his own rocket in Canada. Rushing up north to the secret location of the Vulture&#x27;s hideout, the Torch and Toro ambush the criminal and his minions and destroy the rocket. The Vulture and his men attempt to escape by plane with the two heroes in pursuit, only for the Vulture to unleash a fire-dousing chemical on them causing them to fall to the ground long enough for them to lose trace of the Vulture. On returning to the United States, the heroes encounter the Vulture again, taking the chief&#x27;s other daughter Betty hostage in an attempt to reach the Moon first, blasting off in the rocket only for a following the Torch and Toro to board through the rocket thrusters and knock the Vulture and his men out. The ship is then stopped by aliens calling themselves the Guardians of Space, who tell the Torch that mankind is not ready for travel into space until they forsake war, before leaving with the Vulture into deep space, never to be seen again.

===Adrian Toomes===
Adrian Toomes was born in Staten Island, New York. He is a former electronic engineer who was once Gregory Bestman&#x27;s business partner; Bestman handled the finances whilst Toomes handled the inventions. One day, after creating a flight harness, Toomes eagerly rushed into Bestman&#x27;s office to share the happy news, but he was not there. Toomes discovered that Bestman had secretly been embezzling funds and then, Toomes got no legal recourse, meaning he lost his job. Enraged, Toomes wrecked the business, discovering that exposure to the harness had also granted him superhuman strength. He then decided to turn to crime professionally as the Vulture.

The Vulture employs a special electromagnetic harness of his own design that allows him to fly; his flight is directed by a pair of artificial wings worn on his arms. The harness also endows him with enhanced strength and (according to some sources) increases his lifespan. Although Toomes is advanced in age, he is a strong fighter and a remorseless killer. On one occasion, he restored his youth through biochemical means, though this wore off after exposure to an elemental superhuman&#x27;s corpse. At one point, he had used a device to steal Spider-Man&#x27;s youth, leaving Vulture young and Spider-Man elderly, but this effect wore off within hours.

Vulture was on a robbery and burglary spree throughout New York City when he first encountered Spider-Man. Spider-Man realized for the first time he could sell photos to J. Jonah Jameson after the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; offered a reward for a picture of Vulture. Due to a preoccupation with the camera, Spider-Man was knocked out by Vulture and sealed in a water tank with sides too slippery to climb up, but was able to break free. Vulture then challenged the police, saying he was going to steal diamonds; however, he escaped through the sewers. Spider-Man had created a device that stopped Vulture&#x27;s harness from working and activated it during an airborne fight with Vulture, causing the two to crash onto a roof, knocking Vulture unconscious. He was then arrested. Vulture modified his harness, and attempted to rob the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; payroll. He joined Doctor Octopus&#x27;s first Sinister Six, and gave the message to the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; that the group had captured Betty Brant. He was the last foe to battle Spider-Man before Doctor Octopus. He forced Spider-Man to remove the web-shooters by threatening to fly away, then squirted oil onto the roof, and tried to push Spider-Man off using a wind created by his wings, but Spider-Man escaped this. Vulture was caught after Spider-Man swung onto him using a lasso. He then told Spider-Man where to find Doctor Octopus&#x27;s lair and (like the rest of the team) was jailed at the end of the story.

Later, believing himself to be dying in prison due to injuries obtained in the prison workshop, Toomes revealed an extra Vulture outfit&#x27;s location on the prison grounds to his cellmate Blackie Drago. Drago revealed to Toomes he caused the accident for this very purpose. Toomes was angry, but apparently fell unconscious within the next few minutes; Blackie then knocked out a guard, dug up the wings, and escaped. Drago, as Vulture, teamed with Kraven the Hunter against Spider-Man. Toomes ultimately escaped from prison and recovered from his injuries – crediting his hatred for Drago&#x27;s betrayal with the strength to overcome them – and as the Vulture again, defeating Drago. Toomes then nearly defeated Spider-Man in battle, injuring the arm before Spider-Man managed to play possum and tricked Toomes into coming in close enough for Spider-Man to damage his power pack and force his nemesis to retreat. Some time later, Dr. Clifton Shallot mutated his body into a form resembling Toomes&#x27;s, but possessing natural wings and flight capability.

The Vulture later humiliated the racketeering mobster Mr. Morgan, who hired the Hitman to kill Spider-Man, trying to rob the Vulture of revenge. Vulture then arranged New York&#x27;s top mobsters&#x27; murders to be New York&#x27;s new crime lord, and battled Spider-Man again. Vulture later escaped prison, and battled Spider-Man again.

Vulture came out of retirement to claim vengeance on his former research partner Bestman who embezzled him out of the profits of their business. He then confronted the Vulturions, a group of criminal youths who stole his designs.

He became involved in Atlantic City casino racketeering to prepare for his own ostentatious funeral, but was thwarted by the Hobgoblin. Reduced to a &quot;mere salesman&quot;, he journeyed to Las Vegas, where he attacked Morris &quot;Snake&quot; Diamond in the middle of the desert for stealing Toomes&#x27;s blueprint journals for ultrasonic-sensitive dice. Intending to inject Snake with a mummification serum, Vulture was thwarted by Spider-Man (who had been granted a flight on Snake&#x27;s plane back to New York) and Agent Sara Glenville of the Central Intelligence Division. He later confronted the mutants Rusty Collins and Skids in an attempt to release Nitro.

On more than one occasion, Toomes has been in league with several of Spider-Man&#x27;s other villains to destroy him. Vulture has been in every incarnation of Sinister Six, and also appeared in the ranks of the Sinister Twelve. He has a strong friendship with fellow villain Electro; the two once nearly beat Spider-Man to death.

During one of his many periods of ill health, Toomes struck up a friendship with Nathan Lubensky, a man who had become the new love of May Parker&#x27;s life. Nathan was unaware of Toomes&#x27;s true identity, and encouraged the injured criminal to take chances with life and not to let handicaps drag him down (Nathan was a paraplegic). Toomes followed Nathan&#x27;s advice and went on a crime spree as the Vulture while hiding out in his civilian identity at the same nursing home Nathan lived in, reasoning that the authorities would never think to look for him there. After Peter Parker visited the nursing home and recognized him, however, a battle ensued between the Vulture and Spider-Man. During the course of the fight, Toomes instinctively grabbed a hostage and threatened to kill him if Spider-Man did not back down; however, as soon as Toomes realized that the hostage was Nathan, he decided he could not take the life of a man who had helped to save his own. He shoved Nathan&#x27;s wheelchair at Spider-Man, distracting the web-slinger long enough for Toomes to make his getaway.

Vulture would seemingly cherish Nathan&#x27;s influence, but irony would serve him a cruel blow when he was hired by the Kingpin to assassinate a high-ranking casino runner. During another conflict with Spider-Man just prior to joining Doctor Octopus&#x27;s new Sinister Six, the Vulture sought to use a hostage as a shield, and selected May Parker from the crowd. Nathan, who was with May, leapt from his wheelchair and grabbed Toomes. Not realizing who it was, Toomes flew high into the air with Nathan on his back. The shock of seeing how high they were caused Nathan to suffer a fatal heart attack. Toomes fled as Nathan was falling. Though he was successfully caught by Spider-Man, Nathan would die in May&#x27;s arms.

Toomes was later diagnosed with cancer, caused by frequent exposure to the essential chemicals needed to power his flying apparatus. In an attempt to be forgiven for all of his previous sins, Vulture terrorized the Parker household, pleading that May Parker forgive him for indirectly causing Nathan&#x27;s death. The enraged Parker attacked Toomes, forcing the Vulture to capture him and take him back to his old lair. After escaping Toomes, Peter switched to Spider-Man and brutally assaulted the Vulture, and in the ensuing battle, Vulture&#x27;s own power pack malfunctioned and exploded, setting his wings ablaze. Spider-Man successfully ripped the burning pack off of Toomes, and the two crash landed in a muddy ditch.

After being arrested, Toomes was returned to the Parker home so May, reunited with Peter, could identify him. May hoped that Toomes&#x27; death would be slow and full of suffering. The next day, she visited Toomes in prison and apologized to him for her cruel remarks, but also stated that she could not forgive him, and that any kind of redemption would be left up to him and God.

Vulture stumbled across a plot by the Chameleon and the Green Goblin (Harry Osborn) to drive Spider-Man insane by having shapeshifting androids impersonate his late mother and father; due to Toomes&#x27; interference, the androids were destroyed, leading the wall-crawler to a brief nervous breakdown. The Vulture absorbed the artificial life force from the Mary Parker android, and the effect on the Vulture was twofold; not only did he become a young man again, but he was instantly cured of his cancer. During this period, he attempted to kill everyone who had ever known him as an old man in an attempt to get a clean slate for his life, but this plan went wrong when he targeted a Prowler impersonator as the Prowler having once thwarted his attempted takeover of his old company; Toomes was unconcerned about the fact that the current Prowler was a thief who had stolen the costume of the original Prowler (Hobie Brown) and Spider-Man; although Toomes nearly gutted the fake Prowler, Spider-Man managed to get him to the hospital. During a later fight with Spider-Man, the Vulture was &#x27;attacked&#x27; by David Kalen, a man capable of dissolving anything he touched who had turned his power on himself in his grief at the death of his brother. Toomes subsequently reverted to his old age, presumably due to Kalen&#x27;s power having negated the youth effect. His cancer, however, did not return.

In the &quot;Identity Disc&quot; series, it was revealed that Toomes, with the help of Sandman, manipulated Marvel villains Bullseye, Deadpool, Juggernaut and Sabretooth into laying siege to terrorist group A.I.M. headquarters to retrieve a disc containing the identities of undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives, including his daughter with wife Cheryl, Valeria Toomes a.k.a. &quot;Valerie Jessup&quot;.

During a brief time working for the Owl, he failed in a mission (and had his face brutally slashed by the Black Cat) and was severely beaten as punishment. He subsequently revealed himself as a member of Norman Osborn&#x27;s Sinister Twelve — though he wore a helmet, presumably to mask the wounds.

Under the tutelage of Alyosha Kravinoff, Toomes briefly attempted a stint at heroism, but before long he returned to the other side of the law.

Aside from his daughter, Toomes also has a son whom he has dismissed, and a grandson from that son. The Vulture has come to care deeply for both his grandson and his mother, committing a series of robberies to finance a cure for his grandson&#x27;s terminal illness. He once had a nephew, Malachai Toomes, and flew into a killing rage when he was murdered by a gang-lord.

During the &quot;Civil War&quot;, he was apprehended along with the Grim Reaper and the Trapster, by Captain America and the growing Resistance, who chained him together with Grim Reaper to a pole and broke his nose. When he was found and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D., he complained, &quot;that lunatic broke my damn nose.&quot; After Spider-Man unmasked himself, Toomes was seen in his jail cell, knitting his fingers together. As someone on the television set said they hoped it would not be any trouble for Spider-Man, Toomes said, &quot;Oh, I think it will be.&quot;

After Spider-Man goes rogue, Toomes is seen in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison cell speaking with Agent Jamie Madrox, and commenting on Spider-Man&#x27;s inherent weakness, that being his unwillingness to use his powers for personal gain. S.H.I.E.L.D. then returns his flying harness and encourages him to hunt down Spider-Man, saying that he &quot;is now an outlaw, same as you.&quot;

Later, the Vulture attacks Spider-Man at a book signing, and manages to slash him with a powerful sedative. Toomes, however, falls unconscious and, sensing something is wrong, Spider-Man rushes him to the hospital.

Toomes wakes up a few hours later, where a doctor reveals that he has suffered a stroke, and many of his muscles on the left side of his body have been paralyzed. When the doctor leaves, Spider-Man sneaks in and Toomes asks him to kill him because he is weak. When Spider-Man refuses to do so, he says that Spider-Man is also weak, and always has been. After making remarks about Uncle Ben, Spider-Man takes a pillow and begins suffocating him. He fights back, and Spider-Man removes the pillow, commenting that &quot;For somebody who&#x27;s begging to die, you fight for life pretty hard.&quot;

When Alyosha Kravinoff began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans, Vulture was one of his captives. To stop Vulture from using his intellect to find a way to remove his bomb collar, Kraven broke his hands repeatedly, but with the help of Rhino, Vulture escapes.

Spider-Man later visits Vulture&#x27;s cell to ask him about the latest person who calls himself the Vulture. Toomes says calmly that he has no connection to him, though he heard that the new Vulture was made that way by the mob and is out for revenge. He just as blandly states that while he normally hates people who steal the Vulture name, he would have no problem with him killing Spider-Man.

Following the &quot;Spider-Island&quot;&#x27; storyline, Vulture returns as the leader of an unnamed gang of penthouse thieves and murderers who have vulture-like wings, but with a new gothic style. The members of his gang have the same name of an angel that matches with the black angel look they have. However, it is swiftly revealed that the gang&#x27;s technology is actually controlled by the Vulture who designed their wings so that he could shut them down with a simple signal if they tried to act against him. Having used his new magnetically sensitive webbing to catch the gang and deactivate their wings, Spider-Man defeats Toomes despite his new use of his gravity-manipulating technology to give himself seemingly superhuman strength.

Carlie Cooper later works with the Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius&#x27;s mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body) to investigate a series of crimes committed by the Vulture&#x27;s gang. Superior Spider-Man confronts Vulture and attempts to bribe him into giving up crime by offering him a small fortune from Octavius&#x27;s hidden bank accounts. Vulture does not believe a word of it, and has his midget henchmen attack. Superior Spider-Man accidentally knocks out one of the midget henchmen who turns out to be a young boy. Realizing that Vulture has been using children all this time and remembering his own abusive childhood, Superior Spider-Man attacks Vulture in a rage. After a brief midair struggle, Superior Spider-Man blinds Vulture with a searchlight, causing him to crash onto the roof. Carlie arrives and finds Vulture, broken and bloody, but still alive. Vulture&#x27;s child henchmen are then recruited by the Goblin King to be part of the Goblin Nation. Vulture is later seen in the Raft&#x27;s infirmary, along with Boomerang and Scorpion. When Alistair Alphonso Smythe escapes with the mini-Spider-Slayers&#x27; help, the mini-Spider-Slayers are sent into the infirmary to heal and enhance Vulture, Boomerang, and Scorpion in exchange for their assistance in killing Superior Spider-Man. While Superior Spider-Man fights Boomerang, Vulture is sent to attack the civilians in the Raft. Glory Grant, Norah Winters, and Smythe&#x27;s lawyer plead with him to stop, claiming they can clear him of any charges, causing him to stop and consider his options. When Smythe dies, the Vulture&#x27;s enhancements fail, leaving him blind once again. He is then tasered by Ted Shipley, the Raft&#x27;s Chief of Security. Vulture eventually has another encounter with Superior Spider-Man, seeking revenge for his recent defeats, but is defeated again. Vulture, Chameleon, Electro, Sandman, and Mysterion are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the &quot;Superior Six&quot;, which is forced via mind control to perform heroic (and occasionally dangerous) deeds as an act of &quot;redemption&quot;. When they are not being controlled, they are kept in containment cells. They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, nearly destroying New York in the process. Superior Spider-Man barely manages to stop them with Sun Girl&#x27;s help.

Adrian Toomes later developed a modified version of his electromagnetic harness that has a reinforced helmet and lightweight, razor-sharp, nano-woven wings which responded to his mental commands, where he took on the Falcon name, which he believed to be vacant at the time. He robbed a location in East Village where he fought Spider-Man, until they were immobilized by a new Trapster who made off with Falcon&#x27;s loot.

During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Spider-Man was seen thwarting Vulture&#x27;s robbery when he is called in by Iron Man to help him, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones find Wolverine&#x27;s body when it goes missing from his unmarked grave.

In a prelude to the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Vulture is among the animal-themed characters captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant on Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s behalf. He is among those who Arcade publicly reveals as the Savage Six.

Vulture&#x27;s son Frankie Toomes is married to a woman named Lenora. When Frankie left Lenora, Toomes often visited Lenora and her daughter Tiana to support them. At one point, Vulture took Tiana on a ride in his Vulture suit. After Lenora died from a surgical error, Adrian started to take care of Tiana. As Tiana came to age, Adrian made a suit similar to his so that Tiana can follow whatever destiny awaits. This led to Tiana being Starling.

At the time when Vulture visited Tiana, he gave her a set of pencils. When Spider-Man is sighted outside, Tiana slips off to become Starling to make sure that Spider-Man stayed away from her grandfather. During the fight, Spider-Man mentioned to Starling that her grandfather has killed people like Nathan Lubensky and Gibbon. When Spider-Man collapses upon being hit by the elephant tranquilizers she used on him, Starling realizes that she might be lying to herself about Vulture.

Vulture is among the villains captured by Ultra Living Brain. After Spider-Man defeated the Sinister Six-type Super-Adaptoid, Ultra Living Brain teleported the villains away.

While Nightcrawler assumed an alias as Spinnenmann and later Creepy Crawler, Vulture is operating as Director Vulture at an Orchis facility. In addition, he also upgraded his Vulture harness with a sample of the Technarchy, after Nimrod had captured Warlock for Orchis some time earlier. Vulture uses the Technarchy samples to convert Feral, Animax, Cloak and Dagger, Fatale, and Reaper into Orchis&#x27; version of the Hounds, and he sends them after Mystique and Nightcrawler. He hires Wild Pack to capture Nightcrawler after having become aware of Silver Sable&#x27;s affair with Nightwcrawler at the time, but Nightcrawler, Mystique and Sable turn the tables on him, freeing Warlock and purging him and his Hounds of the Technarchy.

===Blackie Drago===

Raniero &quot;Blackie&quot; Drago was a prison cellmate of Adrian Toomes. He tricked Toomes by causing an accident in the prison workshop that made Toomes think he could die soon, and stole the Vulture harness and costume which was recently rebuilt. He used the suit to make money through air piracy which led to a confrontation with Spider-Man, that Drago believed ended in the wall-crawler&#x27;s death (Spider-Man had merely collapsed due to a serious cold in reality). After robbing a helicopter, Drago was pursued by Kraven the Hunter, who resented his claims of victory over Spider-Man, and ended up fighting him until Spider-Man arrived. Spider-Man managed to defeat them both and webbed them up for the police.

Drago was later &quot;rescued&quot; from prison by Toomes - who revealed that the revelation of Drago&#x27;s role in his accident had given him the strength to overcome his injuries - but that was merely so that Toomes could prove himself to be the true Vulture once again. Once the two were free, he was subsequently defeated and humiliated by Toomes, who regained the recognition he deserved. A humbled Drago was taken away by the police vowing &quot;I&#x27;m through!! I&#x27;ll never put these wings on again! The Vulture&#x27;s too much...for anyone!&quot;

Drago was later seen in the same prison that Norman Osborn was incarcerated in during the &quot;Sinister Twelve&quot; storyline.

===Clifton Shallot===

Dr. Clifton Shallot was an expert on bio-mutation and a professor at Empire State University. He also had one of Toomes&#x27; harnesses and costumes, which he had requisitioned from the State Prison Authority. When one of his courses was cancelled by the university trustees, he snapped, and underwent the final stage of the mutation himself when he donned the Vulture costume – his face, teeth, and fingernails mutated, and for a short time, the wings became part of his body and he could fly. The only ones who knew his secret was his lab assistant Dr. Christine Murrow and her roommate Gloria Jenkins.

Mary Jane Watson witnessed him killing Gloria (whom he had mistaken for Christine) and she became a target. While flying around Mary Jane&#x27;s apartment, he noticed Spider-Man and attacked him. Vulture managed to defeat Spider-Man and leave him for dead. Shallot then searched for a way to reverse the transformation. He stole some chemicals from a ship called the &quot;Düsseldorf&quot; at Dock 20. The next morning as he was flying to Christine&#x27;s lab, Vulture noticed Mary Jane in her car. He dove toward the car and grabbed Mary Jane. He was then encountered in the air by Spider-Man, who dropped Mary Jane, giving Vulture enough time to reach the Biology Lab. He attacked Christine, only for Spider-Man to arrive and defend her. Vulture managed to rip the webbing with his sharp finger claws and teeth. Their fight continued, with Spider-Man blinding Vulture with the webbing as the cops arrived and threw a net over them. Still blinded by the webbing, Vulture broke free from the net and grabbed Spider-Man, thinking he was Christine. When he saw it was Spider-Man, Vulture ended up dropping him.

Vulture went back to his lab and transformed back into Shallot. He then had an agreement with Christine, stating that he would not kill her if she did not betray his trust. Later that night, Vulture flew back to Dock 20 and stole more chemicals. He noticed that Peter Parker had followed him and picked him up and dropped him into the water. When he flew above Mary Jane&#x27;s apartment, Vulture noticed her getting into a taxi. Vulture attacked the taxi and kidnapped Mary Jane, only for Spider-Man to interrupt him, causing Vulture to flee. He made it back to his lab where Christine was. Spider-Man then arrived an hour later, finding Christine there. Vulture then attacked Spider-Man, who subdued him and force-fed Vulture the antidote he had stolen from the &quot;Düsseldorf&quot;. After reverting from his Vulture form, Shallot fainted. Shallot is presumably still serving his sentence for the murder of Gloria.

===Jimmy Natale===

A fourth Vulture appears in the story arc &quot;Spider-Man 24/7&quot;. He is a human/bird hybrid vigilante rather than supervillain, mercilessly killing and eating criminals. While fighting, he temporarily blinded Spider-Man with an acid that the creature spits in his face. Spider-Man defeated a newer Vulture in the Yankee Stadium.

During &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; storyline, he escaped from prison and goes after the mobsters responsible for his transformation. The first mobster he finds revealed Vulture&#x27;s past as the Maggia&#x27;s &quot;cleaner&quot; Jimmy Natale and then, lies about the transformation caused by J. Jonah Jameson. In truth, it is actually Dr. Charles Goss, a biochemist who used these machines that were previously owned by the Stillwell brothers so they can have a new Vulture. Dr. Goss fibs that Jameson had a hand in his creation, until he confessed to the proper authorities. When Spider-Man fended him off, Vulture visits the mobster again, who came clean for being behind his mutation. After that, he killed him. Vulture was later seen soaring above the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; ruins and flew past by a jobless Peter Parker at night.

In the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; story-arc, the Vulture joins Doctor Octopus&#x27; supervillain team, which was assembled to procure specific items. He attacks Spider-Man, who is caring for Lily Hollister&#x27;s newborn child in Hamilton Heights, but their fight was interrupted by the Freak. The two villains team-up after a brief scrimmage and are knocked out by Spider-Man.

A further-mutated Vulture is hired by the Exchange to assassinate the Punisher. Vulture ambushes the vigilante at an abandoned warehouse, and the two engage in an aerial battle, which ends with the Punisher fatally stabbing the Vulture in the torso and jaw, causing him to crash land in the South Bronx. The Punisher fled the scene, leaving Vulture&#x27;s body to be recovered by the NYPD, and examined by Carlie Cooper.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
By utilizing their Vulture harnesses, each Vulture is able to fly as if with a natural winged flight. He wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric housing an electromagnetic harness with artificial bird-like wings attached beneath the arms. This consists of an anti-graviton generator worn on his body as a harness, enabling him to hover silently with precise maneuverability.

; Adrian Toomes
The Vulture harness increases Toomes&#x27; resistance to injury in which that he can survive blows from Spider-Man&#x27;s super strength. Another by-product of his exposure to its unique radiation as that, despite old age and no exercise of Adrian Toomes, his physical strength represents the upper limits in human development. When he removes it, most of these abilities would slowly fade, although the rate at which this transpires remains unclear (some writers have suggested that his strength is permanent). Toomes is also elderly and depends on the tailored suit for strength, speed, and health boosting, as well as draining life-forces to maintain his own youth. It has recently been revealed that, due to the prolonged use of his harness, he could levitate or float even without it, but Vulture still need those wings for mobility while airborne. He once upgraded a new version of his flying apparatus, complete with battle armor, metallic wings, and sharpened feathers. During the later years, he added various weapons to his arsenal. Vulture possesses brilliant expertise in the fields of electronics and chemistry, with a great talent for invention.

; Blackie Drago
While wearing the Vulture costume, Drago has super strength, durability, and speed, as well as flight. He added a built-in radio helmet with limited receiver functions as extra protection for his head.

; Clifton Shallot
As a physical duplicate of the Vulture, Shallot has enhanced strength, resilience, and mobility, along with natural fangs and talons. He is capable of flight, due to the wings grafted onto his body.

; Jimmy Natale
The Red Vulture possesses inhuman strength and durability, as well as flight, natural talons, and acid expulsion. His costume is identical to Toomes, complete with bladed feathers.

<text>Charles Rollin (30 January 1661 in Paris - 14 December 1741 in Paris) was a French historian and educator.

==Life==
Rollin was the son of a cutler, and at the age of 22 was made a master in the Collège du Plessis. In 1694 he was rector of the University of Paris, rendering great service among other things by reviving the study of Greek. He held that post for two years instead of one, and in 1699 was appointed principal of the Collège de Beauvais.

Rollin held Jansenist principles, and even went so far as to defend the miracles supposed to be worked at the tomb of François de Paris, commonly known as Deacon Paris. Unfortunately his religious opinions deprived him of his appointments and disqualified him for the rectorship, to which in 1719 he had been re-elected. It is said that the same reason prevented his election to the Académie française, though he was a member of the Academie des Inscriptions. Shortly before his death he protested publicly against the acceptance of the bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;.

==Works==
Rollin&#x27;s literary work dates chiefly from the later years of his life, when he had been forbidden to teach. His once famous &quot;Ancient History&quot; (, 12 vols., Paris, 1730–38) and the less generally read &quot;Roman History&quot; (&#x27;, only five of nine volumes finished by the time of his death) were avowed compilations, uncritical and somewhat inaccurate. But they instructed and interested, generation after generation. A more original and really important work was his &quot;Treatise on Education&quot; (&#x27;, Paris, 1726–31), which contains a summary of what was even then a reformed and innovative system of education, discarding the medieval traditions that had lingered in France, emphasizing the study of national history after dropping Latin for vernacular in textbooks. Rollin himself didn&#x27;t begin writing in French until age 60.

<text>The Ultra Low Floortram (ULF) is a low-floor tram operating in Vienna, Austria, and Oradea, Romania, built by a consortium composed of Siemens and ELIN in Vienna. It has the lowest floor-height of any such vehicle.

== Overview ==

In contrast to other low-floor trams, the floor in the interior of ULF is at sidewalk height (about above the road surface), which makes access to trams easy for passengers in wheelchairs or with baby carriages. This configuration required a new undercarriage. The axles had to be replaced by a complex electronic steering of the traction motors. Auxiliary devices are installed largely under the car&#x27;s roof.

The ULF technology went into testing in the early 1990s. Since 1998, ULFs have been in use on Vienna&#x27;s tram network. As of mid-2008, 302 cars were in operation (150 cars since mid-2006, and another 152 as of 2007).

Siemens ULF trams were introduced in Oradea, Romania, on 24 April 2008, and are the only ULF trams outside Austria.

<text>The Hadassah convoy massacre took place on April 13, 1948, when a convoy, escorted by Haganah militia, bringing medical and military supplies and personnel to Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, was ambushed by Arab forces. Seventy-eight Jewish doctors, nurses, students, patients, faculty members and Haganah fighters, and one British soldier were killed in the attack, including twenty three women. Dozens of unidentified bodies, burned beyond recognition, were buried in a mass grave in the Sanhedria Cemetery.

The Jewish Agency claimed that the massacre was a gross violation of international humanitarian law, and demanded action be taken against a breach of the Geneva Conventions. The Arabs claimed they had attacked a military formation, that all members of the convoy had engaged in combat, and that it had been impossible to distinguish combatants from civilians. An enquiry was conducted. Eventually an agreement was reached to separate military from humanitarian convoys. It was undertaken as a retaliation after the Deir Yassin massacre five days earlier on 9 April, in which Zionist militant groups of Irgun and Lehi massacred at least 107 Arab villagers, including women and children.

==Mount Scopus blockade==
In 1948, following the UN Partition Plan and anticipating Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence, Arab troops blocked access to Hadassah Hospital and the Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus, Jerusalem. The only access was via a narrow road, a mile and a half long passing through the Arab neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, which the Arabs had seeded with mines that could be detonated by electrical triggering at a distance. The Haganah had used Mount Scopus as an outpost and a base for a raid on the village of Wadi al-Joz on February 26, as part of the struggle between Jewish and Arab militias over control of transportation routes in north Jerusalem. The area covered by the Hadassah hospital had great strategic importance, since it allowed one to take the Arab lines from their rear.

At 2:05 pm March 2, the operator at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem received a phone call from an Arab caller who warned that the hospital would be blown up within 90 minutes, but there was no bomb.

At a press conference on March 17, the leader of the Arab forces in Jerusalem, Abdul Kader Husseini, threatened that Hadassah Hospital and Hebrew University would be captured or destroyed. He went on record as declaring, &quot;Since Jews have been attacking us and blowing up houses containing women and children from bases in Hadassah Hospital and Hebrew University, I have given orders to occupy or even demolish them.&quot; Husseini was subsequently killed on April 8 while reconnoitering the Kastel to block relief convoys to Jerusalem. This factor, according to Marlin Levin, also influenced the decision to attack the convoy. Revenge for this and retaliation for the Deir Yassin Massacre five days earlier on April 9, in which Zionist militant groups of Irgun and Lehi massacred at least 107 Arab Palestinian villages, including women and children, inspired two of Husseini&#x27;s lieutenants, Mohammed Abdel Najar and Adil Abd Latif, to undertake the assault.

Arab sniper fire on vehicles moving along the access route had become a regular occurrence, and road mines had been laid. The British Colonial Secretary and the High Commissioner had given assurances that the relief convoys would be given British protection. The Red Cross had offered to put Mount Scopus under its flag on condition that the area be demilitarized, but the Hadassah leaders declined the proposal, though a plan was prepared for an eventual evacuation if the authorities could not ensure the daily passage of three convoys. Unless this could be done, the only alternative was to accept the Red Cross offer. Jerusalem&#x27;s 100,000 Jews depended on its services, wherever it was located. Dr Yassky had found suitable quarters for the hospital in Jerusalem and was preparing to make arrangements for the transfer of the hospital there.

When food and supplies at the hospital begun to dwindle, a large convoy carrying doctors and supplies set out for the besieged hospital, marked by a &quot;red shield&quot;, which should have guaranteed its neutrality. The British commander of Jerusalem assured the Jews that the road was safe. For the preceding month, a tacit truce had been in place and the passage of convoys had taken place without serious incident. On April 11, the regional British commander gave assurances the road was safe, but noted that, after the Deir Yassin massacre, tensions were high. According to Henry Laurens, an Australian officer tipped off the combatants of the Arab quarter through which the convoy had to pass, that the men of the Haganah had a mission to use the enclave to attack the Arab quarters and cut the route to Ramallah, and that, acting on this information, the Arabs then set up an ambush.
==Attack==
On April 13, the convoy, comprising ten vehicles (two ambulances, three buses of medical staff, and three logistical trucks, escorted by two Haganah armoured cars), set off for the hospital at 9.30 am. They carried 105 passengers. It was commanded by the Jerusalem Haganah Lieutenant Asher Rahav, who escorted convoys in an armoured Ford truck. The line was ordered so that Rahav&#x27;s vehicle headed the column, followed by the two ambulances, then the buses and the three supply trucks, with another escort car taking up the rear. The Sheikh Jarrah Quarter provided an ideal position for an ambush in a small stretch of the road between Nashashibi Bend and the Shepherd Hotel, where a small unit of twelve men from the British Highland Light Infantry armed with a heavy machine gun and bazookas were stationed. It stood some from the eventual site of the ambush. The local British inspector, Robert J. Webb, head of the Mea Shearim police station, usually travelled the road beforehand to ascertain if the route was safe. On this particular day, he said over the phone that the route was secure, but did not make his customary excursion to the Nashashibi bend where he could confirm this.

Rahav noticed several odd circumstances along the road: little traffic, closed shops, and Arabs in Iraqi uniform with bandoliers. At approximately 9:45 am, a mine was electrically detonated five feet in front of Rahav&#x27;s Ford, which contained a contingent of ten soldiers and two hitchhiking Haganah members. The truck tilted into a ditch. At the same time, the convoy came under raking fire from Arab forces. Five vehicles managed to back out and return to base, while the rear Haganah escort car inexplicably wheeled about and returned to Jerusalem. Abdel Najar&#x27;s ambush unit numbered around forty, and were later joined by men commanded by Mohammed Gharbieh, and many other fighters alerted to the battle.

British and Palmach forces were slow to come to the convoy&#x27;s assistance. The Jewish liaison officer with the British army asked for permission to send in a Haganah relief force, which was denied on the grounds it might interfere with a cease-fire negotiation. British forces in the area did not intervene initially, the reason, according to Meron Benvenisti, being to &quot;let the Arabs take revenge for Deir Yassin, so as to calm somewhat the rage of the Arab world.&quot; Marlin Levin suggests that the Arabs had an understanding whereby their operation would not be blocked if they refrained from firing on British units. One of the first men on the scene was Major Jack Churchill, who arrived on the scene at 11:15 am and banged on a bus, offering to evacuate members of the convoy in an APC. His offer was refused in the belief that the Haganah would come to their aid in an organized rescue. When no relief arrived, Churchill and his twelve men provided what cover fire they could against hundreds of Arabs. The Army unit tried to arrange a cease-fire between &quot;11 and noon&quot;. Shortly after 1 pm, two British armoured cars, one occupied by the commander of British forces in Palestine, General Gordon MacMillan, approached the area from the Nablus road, observed the firefight, but refrained from risking British lives by intervening, preferring to let the Jews and Arabs fight it out themselves. As they passed Nashashibi bend, according to one testimony, they blocked the retreat, and Rahav ordered his men to fire at them in order to have them get out of the way. They left the scene at 2 pm, returning at 3 pm with heavier weapons. Negotiations were conducted between one of the leaders of the Arab ambush, Adil Latif, two Haganah men and a British officer, the Arabs proposing that all Jewish arms be surrendered, and all Jewish men capable of combat taken prisoner. The talks were suddenly interrupted when Latif was shot down.

At around 2 pm, the first of the buses was set on fire, and shortly after the second was enveloped in flames, both from Molotov cocktails. Only one man from each bus survived, Shalom Nissan and Nathan Sandowsky, the latter testifying that passing British convoys refused to render help despite their pleas. Arab shouts of &quot;Minshan Deir Yassin&quot; (&quot;For Deir Yassin&quot;) could be heard. Dr. Chaim Yassky was mortally wounded by a ricocheting bullet in the white ambulance, which had the thickest armour of all, at around 2.30 pm. The Haganah made one further attempt to mount a rescue by towing out vehicles with an armoured car, but failed. Throughout the day, pleas had been made for British intervention without result. Brigadier Jones eventually received permission at 4 pm, reached the British outpost behind the convoy with three armoured cars, and their fire raked Arab forces, shooting fifteen Arabs, while bazookas were also employed as half-tracks were despatched to collect the survivors. At 5 pm, the Army &quot;laid down smoke&quot;, and began retrieving the 28 survivors, by which time one bus was burnt out and a second on fire. Following the massacre, Churchill oversaw the evacuation of 700 patients and staff from the hospital.

Two Irgun militants injured at Deir Yassin were among the patients being transported in the convoy.

==Casualties==


In the attack, 78 Jews and one British soldier were killed by gunfire or were burnt when their vehicles were set on fire. Twenty-three were women. Among the dead were Dr. Chaim Yassky, director of the hospital, and Dr. Moshe Ben-David, slated to head the new medical school (which was eventually established by the Hebrew University in the 1950s).

Most of the bodies were burned beyond recognition. The 31 victims that could be identified were buried individually. The remaining 47 Jews were purportedly buried in a mass grave in the Sanhedria Cemetery. However, in the mid-1970s, Yehoshua Levanon, the son of one of the victims, discovered that a commission of inquiry convened at the time of the attack reported that only 25 were buried in the mass grave and 22 victims were missing. Going in search of the missing bodies, in 1993 he met an Arab who had participated in the ambush, who claimed that the attackers had buried stray body parts in a mass grave near the Lions&#x27; Gate. In 1996 Levinson petitioned the Israeli High Court to force the Defense Ministry to set up a genetic database to identify the 25 bodies buried in the Sanhedria cemetery. The mass grave was never opened. One British soldier also died in the attack, making the total of fatalities 79.

==Aftermath==
The day after the attack, several thousand Orthodox Jews demonstrated in the Jewish Quarter, demanding a &quot;cease fire&quot;. In a statement they claimed that the demonstration was broken up by the Haganah.

British soldier Jack Churchill coordinated the evacuation of 700 Jewish doctors, students and patients from the Hadassah hospital on the Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.

==Inquiry==
On that same day, April 12, the Jewish Agency requested that the Red Cross intervene over what they called a grave Arab violation of the conventions. An inquiry conducted among the Arabs, Jews and the British suggested the circumstances were more complex. The firefight had lasted several hours, indicating that the convoy was armed. The Arabs claimed that they had attacked the military formation by blowing up the armoured cars. They were unable to make a distinction between military and civilians because, they maintained, all the Jews, including the medical personnel, had taken part in the battle. The Jews claimed that they had the right to protect their medical convoys with troops. They admitted in the end, according to Jacques de Reynier, that they had been relieving the unit at the Hadassah hospital and furnishing the troop there with ammunition with the same convoys as those of the Red Shield. That practice was justified, they said, because the role of that troop was exclusively one of defending the hospital.

De Reynier repeated the position of the Red Cross that a mobile medical unit must move around unarmed and always separately from combat units. One had a choice between having recourse to armed protection or the protection of the Geneva Conventions and the Red Cross flag. Both staging troops in a position of strategic importance and refurnishing them with supplies, de Reynier argued, had nothing to do with the hospital&#x27;s functions. The Jewish Agency had been prepared to have the troop stationed there withdrawn and its protection entrusted to the Red Cross but was overruled by the Haganah, which insisted that convoys to the hospital could not pass unless they went under military escort. De Reynier then volunteered to put this to the test with a practical proof that an unarmed convoy could pass.

The following day, without warning the Arabs, he led a small column of vehicles under a Red Cross flag while the following cars displayed the red shield. Their passage passed without a shot, and de Reynier argued that to be proof that the Arabs respected the Red Cross. The result was that leaders on both sides eventually ordered that military operations were to be separated from activities associated with medical assistance and the Red Cross.

The situation in the compound became grim, and the decision was made to evacuate the hospital in early May, leaving a staff of 200 to run a reduced 50 beds. The hospital was effectively closed by the end of May, as no supplies could reach it, though a small number of doctors and students remained. In July, a deal was worked out where Mount Scopus became a United Nations area, with 84 Jewish policemen assigned to guard the now-shuttered hospital.
In the armistice agreement with Jordan, signed on April 3, 1949, the hospital became a demilitarized Israeli enclave, with a small adjacent no-man&#x27;s-land (containing a World War I Allied military cemetery under British supervision) and the rest of Mount Scopus and East Jerusalem becoming Jordanian. The Israeli government and Hadassah donors then re-founded the hospital in Israeli West Jerusalem, with the original hospital staff (Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital).

The Mount Scopus hospital resumed medical services only after the Six-Day War.

On the 60th anniversary of the massacre, the city of Jerusalem named a street in honor of Dr. Yassky.

<doc id="313530" wikidata="Q81214" url="?curid=313530" title="Sperm whale">
<text>The sperm whale or cachalot (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. It is the only living member of the genus &quot;Physeter&quot; and one of three extant species in the sperm whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of the genus &quot;Kogia&quot;.

The sperm whale is a pelagic mammal with a worldwide range, and will migrate seasonally for feeding and breeding. Females and young males live together in groups, while mature males (bulls) live solitary lives outside of the mating season. The females cooperate to protect and nurse their young. Females give birth every four to twenty years, and care for the calves for more than a decade. A mature, healthy sperm whale has no natural predators, although calves and weakened adults are sometimes killed by pods of killer whales (orcas).

Mature males average in length, with the head representing up to one-third of the animal&#x27;s length. Plunging to , it is the third deepest diving mammal, exceeded only by the southern elephant seal and Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale. The sperm whale uses echolocation and vocalization with source level as loud as 236 decibels (re 1 μPa m) underwater, the loudest of any animal. It has the largest brain on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human&#x27;s. Sperm whales can live 70 years or more.

Sperm whales&#x27; heads are filled with a waxy substance called &quot;spermaceti&quot; (sperm oil), from which the whale derives its name. Spermaceti was a prime target of the whaling industry and was sought after for use in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles. Ambergris, a solid waxy waste product sometimes present in its digestive system, is still highly valued as a fixative in perfumes, among other uses. Beachcombers look out for ambergris as flotsam. Sperm whaling was a major industry in the 19th century, depicted in the novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. The species is protected by the International Whaling Commission moratorium, and is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

== Taxonomy and naming ==

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;sperm whale&quot; is a clipping of &quot;spermaceti whale&quot;. Spermaceti, originally mistakenly identified as the whales&#x27; semen, is the semi-liquid, waxy substance found within the whale&#x27;s head.
(&quot;See &quot;Spermaceti organ and melon&quot; below.&quot;)

The sperm whale is also known as the &quot;cachalot&quot;, which is thought to derive from the archaic French for &#x27;tooth&#x27; or &#x27;big teeth&#x27;, as preserved for example in the word in the Gascon dialect (a word of either Romance
or Basque
origin).

The etymological dictionary of Corominas says the origin is uncertain, but it suggests that it comes from the Vulgar Latin &#x27;sword hilts&#x27;. The word &quot;cachalot&quot; came to English via French from Spanish or Portuguese , perhaps from Galician/Portuguese &#x27;big head&#x27;.

The term is retained in the Russian word for the animal, (), as well as in many other languages.

The scientific genus name &quot;Physeter&quot; comes from the Greek (), meaning &#x27;blowpipe, blowhole (of a whale)&#x27;, or – as a &quot;pars pro toto&quot; – &#x27;whale&#x27;.

The specific name &quot;macrocephalus&quot; is Latinized from the Greek ( &#x27;big-headed&#x27;), from () + ().

Its synonymous specific name &quot;catodon&quot; means &#x27;down-tooth&#x27;, from the Greek elements (&#x27;below&#x27;) and (&#x27;tooth&#x27;); so named because it has visible teeth only in its lower jaw. (&quot;See &quot;Jaws and teeth&quot; below.&quot;)

Another synonym &quot;australasianus&quot; (&#x27;Australasian&#x27;) was applied to sperm whales in the Southern Hemisphere.

=== Taxonomy ===
The sperm whale belongs to the order Cetartiodactyla, the order containing all cetaceans and even-toed ungulates. It is a member of the unranked clade Cetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified into Odontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus, &quot;Physeter&quot;, in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus &quot;Kogia&quot;, the pygmy sperm whale &quot;Kogia breviceps&quot; and the dwarf sperm whale &quot;K. sima&quot;, are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on the sperm whale family).

Swedish ichthyologist Peter Artedi described it as &quot;Physeter catodon&quot; in his 1738 work &quot;Genera piscium&quot;, from the report of a beached specimen in Orkney in 1693 and two beached in the Netherlands in 1598 and 1601. The 1598 specimen was near Berkhey.

The sperm whale is one of the species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He recognised four species in the genus &quot;Physeter&quot;. Experts soon realised that just one such species exists, although there has been debate about whether this should be named &quot;P. catodon&quot; or &quot;P. macrocephalus&quot;, two of the names used by Linnaeus. Both names are still used, although most recent authors now accept &quot;macrocephalus&quot; as the valid name, limiting &quot;catodon&quot; status to a lesser synonym. Until 1974, the species was generally known as &quot;P. catodon&quot;. In that year, however, Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis proposed that the correct name should be &quot;P. macrocephalus&quot;, the second name in the genus &quot;Physeter&quot; published by Linnaeus concurrently with &quot;P. catodon&quot;.

This proposition was based on the grounds that the names were synonyms published simultaneously, and, therefore, the ICZN Principle of the First Reviser should apply. In this instance, it led to the choice of &quot;P. macrocephalus&quot; over &quot;P. catodon&quot;, a view re-stated in Holthuis, 1987. This has been adopted by most subsequent authors, although Schevill (1986 and 1987) argued that &quot;macrocephalus&quot; was published with an inaccurate description and that therefore only the species &quot;catodon&quot; was valid, rendering the principle of &quot;First Reviser&quot; inapplicable. The most recent version of ITIS has altered its usage from &quot;P. catodon&quot; to &quot;P. macrocephalus&quot;, following L. B. Holthuis and more recent (2008) discussions with relevant experts. Furthermore, The Taxonomy Committee of the Society for Marine Mammalogy, the largest international association of marine mammal scientists in the world, officially uses &quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot; when publishing their definitive list of marine mammal species.

==Biology==

===External appearance===
The sperm whale is the largest toothed whale and is among the most sexually dimorphic of all cetaceans. Both sexes are about the same size at birth, but mature males are typically 30% to 50% longer and three times as massive as females.

Newborn sperm whales are usually between long. Female sperm whales are sexually mature at in length, whilst males are sexually mature at . Female sperm whales are physically mature at about in length and generally do not achieve lengths greater than . The largest female sperm whale measured up to long, and an individual of such size would have weighed about . Male sperm whales are physically mature at about in length, and larger males can generally achieve . An long male sperm whale is estimated to have weighed . By contrast, the second largest toothed whale (Baird&#x27;s beaked whale) measures up to and weighs up to .

There are occasional reports of individual sperm whales achieving even greater lengths, with some historical claims reaching or exceeding . One example is the whale that sank the &quot;Essex&quot; (one of the incidents behind &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;), which was claimed to be . However, there is disagreement as to the accuracy of some of these claims, which are often considered exaggerations or as being measured along the curves of the body.

An individual measuring was reported from a Soviet whaling fleet near the Kuril Islands in 1950 and is cited by some authors as the largest accurately measured. It has been estimated to weigh . In a review of size variation in marine megafauna, McClain and colleagues noted that the International Whaling Commission&#x27;s data contained eight individuals larger than . The authors supported a male from the South Pacific in 1933 as the largest recorded. However, sizes like these are rare, with 95% of recorded sperm whales below 15.85 metres (52.0 ft).

In 1853, one sperm whale was reported at in length, with a head measuring . Large lower jawbones are held in the British Natural History Museum and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, measuring and , respectively.

The average size of sperm whales has decreased over the years, probably due to pressure from whaling. Another view holds that exploitation by overwhaling had virtually no effect on the size of the bull sperm whales, and their size may have actually increased in current times on the basis of density dependent effects. Old males taken at Solander Islands were recorded to be extremely large and unusually rich in blubbers.
The sperm whale&#x27;s unique body is unlikely to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale&#x27;s distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal&#x27;s length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close to the front of the head and shifted to the whale&#x27;s left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.

The sperm whale&#x27;s (tail lobes) are triangular and very thick. Proportionally, they are larger than that of any other cetacean, and are very flexible. The whale lifts its flukes high out of the water as it begins a feeding dive. It has a series of ridges on the back&#x27;s caudal third instead of a dorsal fin. The largest ridge was called the &#x27;hump&#x27; by whalers, and can be mistaken for a dorsal fin because of its shape and size.

In contrast to the smooth skin of most large whales, its back skin is usually wrinkly and has been likened to a prune by whale-watching enthusiasts. Albinos have been reported.

===Skeleton===
The ribs are bound to the spine by flexible cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same avascular necrosis that signals decompression sickness in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive damage, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.

Like that of all cetaceans, the spine of the sperm whale has reduced zygapophysial joints, of which the remnants are modified and are positioned higher on the vertebral dorsal spinous process, hugging it laterally, to prevent extensive lateral bending and facilitate more dorso-ventral bending. These evolutionary modifications make the spine more flexible but weaker than the spines of terrestrial vertebrates.

Like many cetaceans, the sperm whale has a vestigial pelvis that is not connected to the spine.

Like that of other toothed whales, the skull of the sperm whale is asymmetrical so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards the left side of the skull.

===Jaws and teeth ===
The sperm whale&#x27;s lower jaw is very narrow and underslung. The sperm whale has 18 to 26 teeth on each side of its lower jaw which fit into sockets in the upper jaw. The teeth are cone-shaped and weigh up to each. The teeth are functional, but do not appear to be necessary for capturing or eating squid, as well-fed animals have been found without teeth or even with deformed jaws. One hypothesis is that the teeth are used in aggression between males. Mature males often show scars which seem to be caused by the teeth. Rudimentary teeth are also present in the upper jaw, but these rarely emerge into the mouth. Analyzing the teeth is the preferred method for determining a whale&#x27;s age. Like the age-rings in a tree, the teeth build distinct layers of cementum and dentine as they grow.

===Brain===

The sperm whale brain is the largest known of any modern or extinct animal, weighing on average about (with the smallest known weighing and the largest known weighing ), more than five times heavier than a human brain, and has a volume of about 8,000 cm3. Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence, it is not the only factor. Elephants and dolphins also have larger brains than humans. The sperm whale has a lower encephalization quotient than many other whale and dolphin species, lower than that of non-human anthropoid apes, and much lower than that of humans.

The sperm whale&#x27;s cerebrum is the largest in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor sense of taste and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The pyramidal tract is poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.

===Biological systems===

The sperm whale respiratory system has adapted to cope with drastic pressure changes when diving. The flexible ribcage allows lung collapse, reducing nitrogen intake, and metabolism can decrease to conserve oxygen. Between dives, the sperm whale surfaces to breathe for about eight minutes before diving again. Odontoceti (toothed whales) breathe air at the surface through a single, S-shaped blowhole, which is extremely skewed to the left. Sperm whales spout (breathe) 3–5 times per minute at rest, increasing to 6–7 times per minute after a dive. The blow is a noisy, single stream that rises up to or more above the surface and points forward and left at a 45° angle. On average, females and juveniles blow every 12.5 seconds before dives, while large males blow every 17.5 seconds before dives. A sperm whale killed south of Durban, South Africa, after a 1-hour, 50-minute dive was found with two dogfish (Scymnodon sp.), usually found at the sea floor, in its belly.

The sperm whale has the longest intestinal system in the world, exceeding 300 m in larger specimens. The sperm whale has a four-chambered stomach that is similar to ruminants. The first secretes no gastric juices and has very thick muscular walls to crush the food (since whales cannot chew) and resist the claw and sucker attacks of swallowed squid. The second chamber is larger and is where digestion takes place. Undigested squid beaks accumulate in the second chamber – as many as 18,000 have been found in some dissected specimens. Most squid beaks are vomited by the whale, but some occasionally make it to the hindgut. Such beaks precipitate the formation of ambergris.
In 1959, the heart of a 22 metric-ton (24 short-ton) male taken by whalers was measured to be , about 0.5% of its total mass. The circulatory system has a number of specific adaptations for the aquatic environment. The diameter of the aortic arch increases as it leaves the heart. This bulbous expansion acts as a windkessel, ensuring a steady blood flow as the heart rate slows during diving. The arteries that leave the aortic arch are positioned symmetrically. There is no costocervical artery. There is no direct connection between the internal carotid artery and the vessels of the brain. Their circulatory system has adapted to dive at great depths, as much as for up to 120 minutes. More typical dives are around and 35 minutes in duration. Myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle tissue, is much more abundant than in terrestrial animals. The blood has a high density of red blood cells, which contain oxygen-carrying haemoglobin. The oxygenated blood can be directed towards only the brain and other essential organs when oxygen levels deplete. The spermaceti organ may also play a role by adjusting buoyancy (see below). The arterial retia mirabilia are extraordinarily well-developed. The complex arterial retia mirabilia of the sperm whale are more extensive and larger than those of any other cetacean.

===Senses===

====Spermaceti organ and melon====
Atop the whale&#x27;s skull is positioned a large complex of organs filled with a liquid mixture of fats and waxes called spermaceti. The purpose of this complex is to generate powerful and focused clicking sounds, the existence of which was proven by Valentine Worthington and William Schevill when a recording was produced on a research vessel in May 1959. The sperm whale uses these sounds for echolocation and communication.

The spermaceti organ is like a large barrel of spermaceti. Its surrounding wall, known as the &quot;case&quot;, is extremely tough and fibrous. The case can hold within it up to 1,900 litres of spermaceti. It is proportionately larger in males. This oil is a mixture of triglycerides and wax esters. It has been suggested that it is homologous to the dorsal bursa organ found in dolphins. The proportion of wax esters in the spermaceti organ increases with the age of the whale: 38–51% in calves, 58–87% in adult females, and 71–94% in adult males. The spermaceti at the core of the organ has a higher wax content than the outer areas. The speed of sound in spermaceti is 2,684 m/s (at 40 kHz, 36 °C), making it nearly twice as fast as in the oil in a dolphin&#x27;s melon.

Below the spermaceti organ lies the &quot;junk&quot; which consists of compartments of spermaceti separated by cartilage. It is analogous to the melon found in other toothed whales. The structure of the junk redistributes physical stress across the skull and may have evolved to protect the head during ramming.

Running through the head are two air passages. The left passage runs alongside the spermaceti organ and goes directly to the blowhole, whilst the right passage runs underneath the spermaceti organ and passes air through a pair of phonic lips and into the distal sac at the very front of the nose. The distal sac is connected to the blowhole and the terminus of the left passage. When the whale is submerged, it can close the blowhole, and air that passes through the phonic lips can circulate back to the lungs. The sperm whale, unlike other odontocetes, has only one pair of phonic lips, whereas all other toothed whales have two, and it is located at the front of the nose instead of behind the melon.

At the posterior end of this spermaceti complex is the frontal sac, which covers the concave surface of the cranium. The posterior wall of the frontal sac is covered with fluid-filled knobs, which are about 4–13 mm in diameter and separated by narrow grooves. The anterior wall is smooth. The knobbly surface reflects sound waves that come through the spermaceti organ from the phonic lips. The grooves between the knobs trap a film of air that is consistent whatever the orientation or depth of the whale, making it an excellent sound mirror.

The spermaceti organs may also help adjust the whale&#x27;s buoyancy. It is hypothesized that before the whale dives, cold water enters the organ, and it is likely that the blood vessels constrict, reducing blood flow, and, hence, temperature. The wax therefore solidifies and reduces in volume. The increase in specific density generates a down force of about and allows the whale to dive with less effort. During the hunt, oxygen consumption, together with blood vessel dilation, produces heat and melts the spermaceti, increasing its buoyancy and enabling easy surfacing. However, more recent work has found many problems with this theory including the lack of anatomical structures for the actual heat exchange. Another issue is that if the spermaceti does indeed cool and solidify, it would affect the whale&#x27;s echolocation ability just when it needs it to hunt in the depths.

Herman Melville&#x27;s fictional story &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; suggests that the &quot;case&quot; containing the spermaceti serves as a battering ram for use in fights between males. A few famous instances include the well-documented sinking of the ships &quot;Essex&quot; and &quot;Ann Alexander&quot; by attackers estimated to weigh only one-fifth as much as the ships.

====Eyes and vision====

The sperm whale&#x27;s eye does not differ greatly from those of other toothed whales except in size. It is the largest among the toothed whales, weighing about 170 g. It is overall ellipsoid in shape, compressed along the visual axis, measuring about 7×7×3 cm. The cornea is elliptical and the lens is spherical. The sclera is very hard and thick, roughly 1 cm anteriorly and 3 cm posteriorly. There are no ciliary muscles. The choroid is very thick and contains a fibrous &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot;. Like other toothed whales, the sperm whale can retract and protrude its eyes, thanks to a 2-cm-thick retractor muscle attached around the eye at the equator, but are unable to roll the eyes in their sockets.

According to Fristrup and Harbison (2002),
sperm whale&#x27;s eyes afford good vision and sensitivity to light. They conjectured that sperm whales use vision to hunt squid, either by detecting silhouettes from below or by detecting bioluminescence. If sperm whales detect silhouettes, Fristrup and Harbison suggested that they hunt upside down, allowing them to use the forward parts of the ventral visual fields for binocular vision.

===Sleeping===
For some time researchers have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a vertical position with their heads just below or at the surface, or head down. A 2008 study published in &quot;Current Biology&quot; recorded evidence that whales may sleep with both sides of the brain. It appears that some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of the time, most often between 6 p.m. and midnight.

===Genetics===
Sperm whales have 21 pairs of chromosomes (2n=42). The genome of live whales can be examined by recovering shed skin.

==Vocalization complex== 
After Valentine Worthington and William E. Schevill confirmed the existence of sperm whale vocalization, further studies found that sperm whales are capable of emitting sounds at a source level of 230 decibels–making the sperm whale the loudest animal in the world.

===Mechanism===
When echolocating, the sperm whale emits a directionally focused beam of broadband clicks. Clicks are generated by forcing air through a pair of phonic lips (also known as &quot;monkey lips&quot; or &quot;&quot;) at the front end of the nose, just below the blowhole. The sound then travels backwards along the length of the nose through the spermaceti organ. Most of the sound energy is then reflected off the frontal sac at the cranium and into the melon, whose lens-like structure focuses it. Some of the sound will reflect back into the spermaceti organ and back towards the front of the whale&#x27;s nose, where it will be reflected through the spermaceti organ a third time. This back and forth reflection which happens on the scale of a few milliseconds creates a multi-pulse click structure.

This multi-pulse click structure allows researchers to measure the whale&#x27;s spermaceti organ using only the sound of its clicks. Because the interval between pulses of a sperm whale&#x27;s click is related to the length of the sound producing organ, an individual whale&#x27;s click is unique to that individual. However, if the whale matures and the size of the spermaceti organ increases, the tone of the whale&#x27;s click will also change. The lower jaw is the primary reception path for the echoes. A continuous fat-filled canal transmits received sounds to the inner ear.

The source of the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the nostrils of the land-based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.

Air that passes through the phonic lips passes into the distal sac, then back down through the left nasal passage. This recycling of air allows the whale to continuously generate clicks for as long as it is submerged.

===Vocalization types===
The sperm whale&#x27;s vocalizations are all based on clicking, described in four types: the usual echolocation, creaks, codas, and slow clicks.

The usual echolocation click type is used in searching for prey. A creak is a rapid series of high-frequency clicks that sounds somewhat like a creaky door hinge. It is typically used when homing in on prey.

Slow clicks are heard only in the presence of males (it is not certain whether females occasionally make them). Males make a lot of slow clicks in breeding grounds (74% of the time), both near the surface and at depth, which suggests they are primarily mating signals. Outside breeding grounds, slow clicks are rarely heard, and usually near the surface.

====Codas====
The most distinctive vocalizations are codas, which are short rhythmic sequences of clicks, mostly numbering 3–12 clicks, in stereotyped patterns. They are classified using variations in the number of clicks, rhythm, and tempo.

Codas are the result of vocal learning within a stable social group, and are made in the context of the whales&#x27; social unit. &quot;The foundation of sperm whale society is the matrilineally based social unit of ten or so females and their offspring. The members of the unit travel together, suckle each others&#x27; infants, and babysit them while mothers make long deep dives to feed.&quot; Over 70% of a sperm whale&#x27;s time is spent independently foraging; codas &quot;could help whales reunite and reaffirm their social ties in between long foraging dives.&quot;

While nonidentity codas are commonly used in multiple different clans, some codas express clan identity, and denote different patterns of travel, foraging, and socializing or avoidance among clans. In particular, whales will not group with whales of another clan even though they share the same geographical area. Statistically, as the clans&#x27; ranges become more overlapped, the distinction in clan identity coda usage becomes more pronounced. Distinctive codas identify seven clans described among the approximately 150,000 female sperm whales in the Pacific Ocean, and there are another four clans in the Atlantic. As &quot;arbitrary traits that function as reliable indicators of cultural group membership,&quot; clan identity codas act as symbolic markers that modulate interactions between individuals.

Individual identity in sperm whale vocalizations is an ongoing scientific issue, however. A distinction needs to be made between cues and signals. Human acoustic tools can distinguish individual whales by analyzing micro-characteristics of their vocalizations, and the whales can probably do the same. This does not prove that the whales deliberately use some vocalizations to signal individual identity in the manner of the signature whistles that bottlenose dolphins use as individual labels.

==Ecology==

===Distribution===

Sperm whales are among the most cosmopolitan species. They prefer ice-free waters over deep. Although both sexes range through temperate and tropical oceans and seas, only adult males populate higher latitudes. Among several regions, such as along coastal waters of southern Australia, sperm whales have been considered to be locally extinct.

They are relatively abundant from the poles to the equator and are found in all the oceans. They inhabit the Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea, while their presence in the Red Sea is uncertain. The shallow entrances to both the Black Sea and the Red Sea may account for their absence. The Black Sea&#x27;s lower layers are also anoxic and contain high concentrations of sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide. The first ever sighting off the coast of Pakistan was made in 2017. The first ever record off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula (Yellow Sea) was made in 2005. followed by one near Ganghwa Island in 2009.

Populations are denser close to continental shelves and canyons. Sperm whales are usually found in deep, off-shore waters, but may be seen closer to shore, in areas where the continental shelf is small and drops quickly to depths of . Coastal areas with significant sperm whale populations include the Azores and Dominica. In east Asian waters, whales are also observed regularly in coastal waters in places such as the Commander and Kuril Islands, Shiretoko Peninsula which is one of few locations where sperm whales can be observed from shores, off Kinkasan, vicinity to Tokyo Bay and the Bōsō Peninsula to the Izu and the Izu Islands, the Volcano Islands, Yakushima and the Tokara Islands to the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the Northern Mariana Islands, and so forth. Historical catch records suggest there could have been smaller aggression grounds in the Sea of Japan as well. Along the Korean Peninsula, the first confirmed observation within the Sea of Japan, eight animals off Guryongpo, was made in 2004 since after the last catches of five whales off Ulsan in 1911, while nine whales were observed in the East China Sea side of the peninsula in 1999.

Grown males are known to enter surprisingly shallow bays to rest (whales will be in a state of rest during these occasions). Unique, coastal groups have been reported from various areas around the globe, such as near Scotland&#x27;s coastal waters, and the Shiretoko Peninsula, off Kaikōura, in Davao Gulf. Such coastal groups were more abundant in pre-whaling days.

Genetic analysis indicates that the world population of sperm whales originated in the Pacific Ocean from a population of about 10,000 animals around 100,000 years ago, when expanding ice caps blocked off their access to other seas. In particular, colonization of the Atlantic was revealed to have occurred multiple times during this expansion of their range.

===Diet===
Sperm whales usually dive between , and sometimes , in search of food. Such dives can last more than an hour. They feed on several species, notably the giant squid, but also the colossal squid, octopuses, and fish such as demersal rays and sharks, but their diet is mainly medium-sized squid. Sperm whales may also possibly prey upon swordfish on rare occasions. Some prey may be taken accidentally while eating other items. Most of what is known about deep-sea squid has been learned from specimens in captured sperm whale stomachs, although more recent studies analysed faeces.

One study, carried out around the Galápagos, found that squid from the genera &quot;Histioteuthis&quot; (62%), &quot;Ancistrocheirus&quot; (16%), and &quot;Octopoteuthis&quot; (7%) weighing between were the most commonly taken. Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or colossal squid have never been observed by humans; however, white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid. One study published in 2010 collected evidence that suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when hunting Humboldt squid. Tagging studies have shown that sperm whales hunt upside down at the bottom of their deep dives. It is suggested that the whales can see the squid silhouetted above them against the dim surface light.

An older study, examining whales captured by the New Zealand whaling fleet in the Cook Strait region, found a 1.69:1 ratio of squid to fish by weight. Sperm whales sometimes take sablefish and toothfish from long lines. Long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska complain that sperm whales take advantage of their fishing operations to eat desirable species straight off the line, sparing the whales the need to hunt. However, the amount of fish taken is very little compared to what the sperm whale needs per day. Video footage has been captured of a large male sperm whale &quot;bouncing&quot; a long line, to gain the fish. Sperm whales are believed to prey on the megamouth shark, a rare and large deep-sea species discovered in the 1970s. In one case, three sperm whales were observed attacking or playing with a megamouth.

Sperm whales have also been noted to feed on bioluminescent pyrosomes such as &quot;Pyrosoma atlanticum&quot;. It is thought that the foraging strategy of sperm whales for bioluminescent squids may also explain the presence of these light-emitting pyrosomes in the diet of the sperm whale.
The sharp beak of a consumed squid lodged in the whale&#x27;s intestine may lead to the production of ambergris, analogous to the production of pearls in oysters. The irritation of the intestines caused by squid beaks stimulates the secretion of this lubricant-like substance. Sperm whales are prodigious feeders and eat around 3% of their body weight per day. The total annual consumption of prey by sperm whales worldwide is estimated to be about . In comparison, human consumption of seafood is estimated to be .

Sperm whales hunt through echolocation. Their clicks are among the most powerful sounds in the animal kingdom (see above). It has been hypothesised that it can stun prey with its clicks. Experimental studies attempting to duplicate this effect have been unable to replicate the supposed injuries, casting doubt on this idea. One study showing that sound pressure levels on the squid are more than an order of magnitude below levels required for debilitation, and therefore, precluding acoustic
stunning to facilitate prey capture.

Sperm whales, as well as other large cetaceans, help fertilise the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans&#x27; surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants on the surface of the ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.

==Life cycle==

Sperm whales can live 70 years or more. They are a prime example of a species that has been K-selected, meaning their reproductive strategy is associated with stable environmental conditions and comprises a low birth rate, significant parental aid to offspring, slow maturation, and high longevity.

How they choose mates has not been definitively determined. Bulls will fight with each other over females, and males will mate with multiple females, making them polygynous, but they do not dominate the group as in a harem. Bulls do not provide paternal care to their offspring but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show dominance.

Females become fertile at around 9 years of age. The oldest pregnant female ever recorded was 41 years old. Gestation requires 14 to 16 months, producing a single calf. Sexually mature females give birth once every 4 to 20 years (pregnancy rates were higher during the whaling era). Birth is a social event, as the mother and calf need others to protect them from predators. The other adults may jostle and bite the newborn in its first hours.

Lactation proceeds for 19 to 42 months, but calves, rarely, may suckle up to 13 years. Like that of other whales, the sperm whale&#x27;s milk has a higher fat content than that of terrestrial mammals: about 36%, compared to 4% in cow milk. This gives it a consistency similar to cottage cheese, which prevents it from dissolving in the water before the calf can drink it. It has an energy content of roughly 3,840 kcal/kg, compared to just 640 kcal/kg in cow milk. Calves may be allowed to suckle from females other than their mothers.

Males become sexually mature at 18 years. Upon reaching sexual maturity, males move to higher latitudes, where the water is colder and feeding is more productive. Females remain at lower latitudes. Males reach their full size at about age 50.

==Social behaviour==

===Relations within the species===
Like elephants, females and their young live in matriarchal groups called pods, while bulls live apart. Bulls sometimes form loose bachelor groups with other males of similar age and size. As they grow older, they typically live solitary lives, only returning to the pod to socialize or to breed. Bulls have beached themselves together, suggesting a degree of cooperation which is not yet fully understood. The whales rarely, if ever, leave their group.

A &quot;social unit&quot; is a group of sperm whales who live and travel together over a period of years. Individuals rarely, if ever, join or leave a social unit. There is a huge variance in the size of social units. They are most commonly between six and nine individuals in size but can have more than twenty. Unlike orcas, sperm whales within a social unit show no significant tendency to associate with their genetic relatives. Females and calves spend about three-quarters of their time foraging and a quarter of their time socializing. Socializing usually takes place in the afternoon.

When sperm whales socialize, they emit complex patterns of clicks called codas. They will spend much of the time rubbing against each other. Tracking of diving whales suggests that groups engage in herding of prey, similar to bait balls created by other species, though the research needs to be confirmed by tracking the prey.

===Relations with other species===
The most common natural predator of sperm whales is the orca (killer whale), but pilot whales and false killer whales sometimes harass them. Orcas prey on target groups of females with young, usually making an effort to extract and kill a calf. The females will protect their calves or an injured adult by encircling them. They may face inwards with their tails out (the &#x27;marguerite formation&#x27;, named after the flower). The heavy and powerful tail of an adult whale is potentially capable of delivering lethal blows. Alternatively, they may face outwards (the &#x27;heads-out formation&#x27;). Other than sperm whales, southern right whales had been observed to perform similar formations. However, formations in non-dangerous situations have been recorded as well. Early whalers exploited this behaviour, attracting a whole unit by injuring one of its members. Such a tactic is described in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;: &quot;Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.&quot;If the killer whale pod is large, its members may sometimes be able to kill adult female sperm whales and can at least injure an entire pod of sperm whales. Bulls have no predators, and are believed to be too large, powerful and aggressive to be threatened by killer whales. Solitary bulls are known to interfere and come to the aid of vulnerable groups nearby. However, the bull sperm whale, when accompanying pods of female sperm whales and their calves as such, may be reportedly unable to effectively dissuade killer whales from their attacks on the group, although the killer whales may end the attack sooner when a bull is present.

However, male sperm whales have been observed to attack and intimidate killer whale pods in competitive feeding instances. An incident was filmed from a long-line trawler: a killer whale pod was systematically taking fish caught on the trawler&#x27;s long lines (as the lines were being pulled into the ship) when a male sperm whale appeared to repeatedly charge the killer whale pod in an attempt to drive them away; it was speculated by the film crew that the sperm whale was attempting to access the same fish. The killer whales employed a tail outward and tail-slapping defensive position against the bull sperm whale similar to that used by female sperm whales against attacking killer whales. However, at some potential feeding sites, the killer whales may prevail over sperm whales even when outnumbered by the sperm whales. Some authors consider the killer whales &quot;usually&quot; behaviorally dominant over sperm whales but express that the two species are &quot;fairly evenly matched&quot;, with the killer whales&#x27; greater aggression, more considerable biting force for their size and predatory prowess more than compensating for their smaller size.

Sperm whales are not known for forging bonds with other species, but it was observed that a bottlenose dolphin with a spinal deformity had been accepted into a pod of sperm whales. They are known to swim alongside other cetaceans such as humpback, fin, minke, pilot, and killer whales on occasion.

===Parasites===
Sperm whales can suffer from parasites.
Out of 35 sperm whales caught during the 1976–1977 Antarctic whaling season, all of them were infected by &quot;Anisakis physeteris&quot; (in their stomachs) and &quot;Phyllobothrium delphini&quot; (in their blubber).
Both whales with a placenta were infected with &quot;Placentonema gigantissima&quot;, potentially the largest nematode worm ever described.

==Evolutionary history==

===Fossil record===
Although the fossil record is poor, several extinct genera have been assigned to the clade Physeteroidea, which includes the last common ancestor of the modern sperm whale, pygmy sperm whales, dwarf sperm whales, and extinct physeteroids. These fossils include &quot;Ferecetotherium&quot;, &quot;Idiorophus&quot;, &quot;Diaphorocetus&quot;, &quot;Aulophyseter&quot;, &quot;Orycterocetus&quot;, &quot;Scaldicetus&quot;, &quot;Placoziphius&quot;, &quot;Zygophyseter&quot; and &quot;Acrophyseter&quot;. &quot;Ferecetotherium&quot;, found in Azerbaijan and dated to the late Oligocene (about ), is the most primitive fossil that has been found, which possesses sperm whale-specific features, such as an asymmetric rostrum (&quot;beak&quot; or &quot;snout&quot;). Most sperm whale fossils date from the Miocene period, . &quot;Diaphorocetus&quot;, from Argentina, has been dated to the early Miocene. Fossil sperm whales from the Middle Miocene include &quot;Aulophyseter&quot;, &quot;Idiorophus&quot; and &quot;Orycterocetus&quot;, all of which were found on the West Coast of the United States, and &quot;Scaldicetus&quot;, found in Europe and Japan. &quot;Orycterocetus&quot; fossils have also been found in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, in addition to the west coast of the United States. &quot;Placoziphius&quot;, found in Europe, and &quot;Acrophyseter&quot;, from Peru, are dated to the late Miocene.

Fossil sperm whales differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count and the shape of the face and jaws. For example, &quot;Scaldicetus&quot; had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene, with the possible exception of &quot;Aulophyseter&quot;, had teeth in their upper jaws. &quot;Acrophyseter&quot;, from the late Miocene, also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving mandible (lower jaw). These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters such as the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. &quot;Zygophyseter&quot;, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy, had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, rather like the modern killer whale (orca). Other fossil sperm whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer sperm whales.

Two poorly known fossil species belonging to the modern genus &quot;Physeter&quot; have been recognized so far: &quot;P. antiquus&quot; (Neogene of France) and &quot;P. vetus&quot; (Neogene of eastern North America). &quot;Physeter vetus&quot; is very likely an invalid species, as the few teeth that were used to identify this species appear to be identical to those of another toothed whale, &quot;Orycterocetus quadratidens&quot;.

===Phylogeny===
The traditional view has been that Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) arose from more primitive whales early in the Oligocene period, and that the super-family Physeteroidea, which contains the sperm whale, dwarf sperm whale, and pygmy sperm whale, diverged from other toothed whales soon after that, over . From 1993 to 1996, molecular phylogenetics analyses by Milinkovitch and colleagues, based on comparing the genes of various modern whales, suggested that the sperm whales are more closely related to the baleen whales than they are to other toothed whales, which would have meant that Odontoceti were not monophyletic; in other words, it did not consist of a single ancestral toothed whale species and all its descendants. However, more recent studies, based on various combinations of comparative anatomy and molecular phylogenetics, criticised Milinkovitch&#x27;s analysis on technical grounds and reaffirmed that the Odontoceti are monophyletic.

These analyses also confirm that there was a rapid evolutionary radiation (diversification) of the Physeteroidea in the Miocene period. The Kogiidae (dwarf and pygmy sperm whales) diverged from the Physeteridae (true sperm whales) at least .
==Usage by humans==
===Sperm whaling===

Spermaceti, obtained primarily from the spermaceti organ, and sperm oil, obtained primarily from the blubber in the body, were much sought after by 18th, 19th, and 20th century whalers. These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such as candles, soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialised lubricants, lamp oil, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds. Ambergris, a highly expensive, solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as a fixative in perfumery.

Prior to the early eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by indigenous Indonesians. Legend has it that sometime in the early 18th century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in his &quot;Essay upon the Natural History of Whales&quot; (1725), states that a certain Atkins, 10 or 12 years in the trade, was among the first to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off the New England coast.

There were only a few recorded instances during the first few decades (1709–1730s) of offshore sperm whaling. Instead, sloops concentrated on the Nantucket Shoals, where they would have taken right whales or went to the Davis Strait region to catch bowhead whales. By the early 1740s, with the advent of spermaceti candles (before 1743), American vessels began to focus on sperm whales. The diary of Benjamin Bangs (1721–1769) shows that, along with the bumpkin sloop he sailed, he found three other sloops flensing sperm whales off the coast of North Carolina in late May 1743. On returning to Nantucket in the summer 1744 on a subsequent voyage, he noted that &quot;45 spermacetes are brought in here this day,&quot; another indication that American sperm whaling was in full swing.

American sperm whaling soon spread from the east coast of the American colonies to the Gulf Stream, the Grand Banks, West Africa (1763), the Azores (1765), and the South Atlantic (1770s). From 1770 to 1775 Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island ports produced 45,000 barrels of sperm oil annually, compared to 8,500 of whale oil. In the same decade, the British began sperm whaling, employing American ships and personnel. By the following decade, the French had entered the trade, also employing American expertise. Sperm whaling increased until the mid-nineteenth century. Spermaceti oil was important in public lighting (for example, in lighthouses, where it was used in the United States until 1862, when it was replaced by lard oil, in turn replaced by petroleum) and for lubricating the machines (such as those used in cotton mills) of the Industrial Revolution. Sperm whaling declined in the second half of the nineteenth century, as petroleum came into broader use. In that sense, petroleum use may be said to have protected whale populations from even greater exploitation. Sperm whaling in the 18th century began with small sloops carrying only one or two whaleboats. The fleet&#x27;s scope and size increased over time, and larger ships entered the fishery. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, sperm whaling ships sailed to the equatorial Pacific, the Indian Ocean, Japan, the coast of Arabia, Australia and New Zealand. Hunting could be dangerous to the crew, since sperm whales (especially bulls) will readily fight to defend themselves against attack, unlike most baleen whales. When dealing with a threat, sperm whales will use their huge head effectively as a battering ram. Arguably the most famous sperm whale counter-attack occurred on 20 November 1820, when a whale claimed to be about long rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship &quot;Essex&quot;. Only 8 out of 21 sailors survived to be rescued by other ships.

The sperm whale&#x27;s ivory-like teeth were often sought by 18th- and 19th-century whalers, who used them to produce inked carvings known as &quot;scrimshaw.&quot; 30 teeth of the sperm whale can be used for ivory. Each of these teeth, up to and across, are hollow for the first half of their length. Like walrus ivory, sperm whale ivory has two distinct layers. However, sperm whale ivory contains a much thicker inner layer. Though a widely practised art in the 19th century, scrimshaw using genuine sperm whale ivory declined substantially after the retirement of the whaling fleets in the 1880s.

Modern whaling was more efficient than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941–1942 and 1942–1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales off the coast of Peru alone. After World War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.

The hunting led to the near-extinction of large whales, including sperm whales, until bans on whale oil use were instituted in 1972. The International Whaling Commission gave the species full protection in 1985, but hunting by Japan in the northern Pacific Ocean continued until 1988.

It is estimated that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling began in the early 18th century. By 1880, it had declined by an estimated 29 percent. From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased, but after the Second World War, the population declined even further, to 33 per cent of the pre-whaling population. Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed by the various whaling nations in the 19th century, while in the 20th century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.
Sperm whales increase levels of primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface waters of the Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.

Remaining sperm whale populations are large enough that the species&#x27; conservation status is rated as vulnerable rather than endangered. However, the recovery from centuries of commercial whaling is a slow process, particularly in the South Pacific, where the toll on breeding-age males was severe.

===Conservation status===
The total number of sperm whales in the world is unknown, but is thought to be in the hundreds of thousands. The conservation outlook is brighter than for many other whales. Commercial whaling has ceased, and the species is protected almost worldwide, though records indicate that in the 11-year period starting from 2000, Japanese vessels have caught 51 sperm whales. Fishermen do not target sperm whales to eat, but long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska have complained about sperm whales &quot;stealing&quot; fish from their lines.

Since the 2000s, entanglement in fishing nets and collisions with ships represent the greatest threats to the sperm whale population. Other threats include ingestion of marine debris, ocean noise, and chemical pollution. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) regards the sperm whale as being &quot;vulnerable&quot;. The species is listed as endangered on the United States Endangered Species Act.

Sperm whales are listed on Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. It is also covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

The species is protected under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This makes commercial international trade (including in parts and derivatives) prohibited, with all other international trade strictly regulated through a system of permits and certificates.

===Cultural importance===

Rope-mounted teeth are important cultural objects throughout the Pacific. In New Zealand, the Māori know them as &quot;rei puta&quot;; such whale tooth pendants were rare objects because sperm whales were not actively hunted in traditional Māori society. Whale ivory and bone were taken from beached whales. In Fiji the teeth are known as &quot;tabua&quot;, traditionally given as gifts for atonement or esteem (called &quot;sevusevu&quot;), and were important in negotiations between rival chiefs. Friedrich Ratzel in &quot;The History of Mankind&quot; reported in 1896 that, in Fiji, whales&#x27; or cachalots&#x27; teeth were the most-demanded article of ornament or value. They occurred often in necklaces. Today the tabua remains an important item in Fijian life. The teeth were originally rare in Fiji and Tonga, which exported teeth, but with the Europeans&#x27; arrival, teeth flooded the market and this &quot;currency&quot; collapsed. The oversupply led in turn to the development of the European art of scrimshaw.

Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is based on a true story about a sperm whale that attacked and sank the whaleship &quot;Essex&quot;. Melville associated the sperm whale with the Bible&#x27;s Leviathan. The fearsome reputation perpetuated by Melville was based on bull whales&#x27; ability to fiercely defend themselves from attacks by early whalers, smashing whaling boats and, occasionally, attacking and destroying whaling ships.

In Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, the Nautilus fights a group of &quot;cachalots&quot; (sperm whales) to protect a pod of southern right whales from their attacks. Verne portrays them as being savage hunters (&quot;nothing but mouth and teeth&quot;).

The sperm whale was designated as the Connecticut state animal by the General Assembly in 1975. It was selected because of its specific contribution to the state&#x27;s history and because of its present-day plight as an endangered species.

===Watching sperm whales===
Sperm whales are not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long distances underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones to listen to the clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of Kaikōura on New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.

===Plastic waste===

The introduction of plastic waste to the ocean environment by humans is relatively new. From the 1970s, sperm whales have occasionally been found with pieces of plastic in their stomachs.

<text>The heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) are a group of 39 developing countries with high levels of poverty and debt overhang. Because of these factors, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have classified them as eligible for special assistance.

The HIPC Initiative was initiated by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1996, following extensive lobbying by NGOs and other bodies. It provides debt relief and low-interest loans to cancel or reduce external debt repayments to sustainable levels. This means the nations can repay debts in a timely fashion in the future. To be considered for the initiative, countries must face an unsustainable debt burden that cannot be managed with traditional means. Assistance is conditional on the national governments of these countries meeting a range of economic management and performance targets and undertaking economic and social reforms.

==Countries==
The 37 countries that have so far received full or partial debt relief are: 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
*

37 countries have completed the program and had their external debt cancelled in full, after Somalia passed the Completion Point in 2020.

An additional two countries (Eritrea and Sudan) are being considered for entry into the program as of March 2020. At its meeting on 28 June 2021, the IMF&#x27;s executive board approved a financing plan to help mobilize resources needed for the fund to cover its share of debt relief to Sudan. This occurred after Sudan&#x27;s civilian-led transitional government and its cabinet led by Abdalla Hamdok implemented tough economic reforms to reach the decision point.

==Requirements==
To receive debt relief under HIPC, a country must first meet HIPC&#x27;s threshold requirements. At HIPC&#x27;s inception in 1996, the primary threshold requirement was that the country&#x27;s debt remains at unsustainable levels despite full application of traditional, bilateral debt relief. At the time, HIPC considered debt unsustainable when the ratio of debt-to-exports exceeded 200-250% or when the ratio of debt-to-government revenues exceeded 280%.

== Funding ==
The IMF estimates that the total cost of providing debt relief to the 40 countries currently eligible for the HIPC program would be around $71 billion (in 2007 dollars). Half of the funding is provided by the IMF, World Bank, and other multilateral organizations, while the other half is provided by the creditor countries. The IMF&#x27;s share of the cost is currently being funded by the proceeds of gold sales by the organization in 1999, but it estimated that this will not be enough to cover the full cost, and further funding will need to be raised if additional countries such as Sudan and Somalia meet the qualification requirements for entry into the program.

== Criticism ==
Critics soon began to attack HIPC&#x27;s scope and its structure. First, they criticized HIPC&#x27;s definition of debt sustainability, arguing that the debt-to-export and debt-to-government-revenues criteria were arbitrary and too restrictive. As evidence, critics highlighted that, by 1999, only four countries had received any debt relief under HIPC. Second, the six-year program was too long and too inflexible to meet the individual needs of debtor nations. Third, the IMF and the World Bank did not cancel any debt until the completion point, leaving countries under the burden of their debt payments while they struggled to institute structural reforms. Fourth, the ESAF conditions often undermined poverty-reduction efforts. For example, privatization of utilities tended to raise the cost of services beyond the citizens&#x27; ability to pay. Finally, critics attacked HIPC as a program designed by creditors to protect creditor interests, leaving countries with unsustainable debt burdens even upon reaching the decision point.

Inadequate debt relief for such countries means that they will need to spend more on servicing debts, rather than on actively investing in programs that can reduce poverty.

In 2008, some analysts showed that the HIPC initiative had failed, and failed miserably. One aspect behind the failure, according to the Nigerien journalist Moussa Tchangari:

=== Responses to criticism ===
HIPC addressed its shortcomings by expanding its definition of unsustainable debts, making greater relief available to more countries, and by making relief available sooner.

Since 1996, the IMF has modified HIPC in several ways, often in response to the shortcomings its critics have highlighted. The IMF first restructured HIPC in 1999. These revisions modified HIPC&#x27;s threshold requirements. Today, HIPC defines three minimum requirements for participation in the program. First, as before, a country must show its debt is unsustainable; however, the targets for determining sustainability decreased to a debt-to-export ratio of 150% and a debt-to-government-revenues ratio of 250%. Second, the country must be sufficiently poor to qualify for loans from the World Bank&#x27;s International Development Association or the IMF&#x27;s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, the successor to ESAF), which provide long-term, interest-free loans to the world&#x27;s poorest nations. Lastly, the country must establish a track record of reforms to help prevent future debt crises.

In addition to the modified threshold requirements, the 1999 revisions introduced several other changes. First, the six-year structure was abandoned and replaced by a &quot;floating completion point&quot; that allows countries to progress towards completion in less than six years. Second, the revised HIPC allows for interim debt relief so that countries begin to see partial relief before reaching the completion point. Third, the PRGF heavily modified ESAF by curtailing the number and detail of IMF conditions and by encouraging greater input from the local community into the program&#x27;s design.

One of PRGF&#x27;s goals is to ensure that impoverished nations re-channel the government funds freed from debt repayment into poverty-reduction programs. To that end, each country&#x27;s PRGF program is modeled around a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). PRSPs describe the macroeconomic, structural, and social programs that a country will follow to promote economic growth and reduce poverty. A broad range of government, NGO, and civil-society groups must participate in the development of the PRSP to ensure the plan has local support. Under the revised HIPC, a country reaches the decision point once it has demonstrated progress in following its PRSP. The country then reaches its completion point once it has implemented and followed its PRSP for at least one year and has demonstrated macroeconomic stability.

In 2001, the IMF introduced another tool to increase HIPC&#x27;s effectiveness. Under the new practice of &quot;topping up,&quot; countries that unexpectedly suffer economic setbacks after the decision point due to external factors, such as rising interest rates or falling commodity prices, are eligible for increased debt forgiveness above the decision-point level.

Further progress towards debt relief was announced on December 21, 2005, when the IMF granted preliminary approval to an initial debt relief measure of US $3.3 billion for 19 of the world&#x27;s poorest countries, with the World Bank expected to write off the larger debts owed to it by 17 HIPCs in mid-2006.&quot;

As of December 2006, twenty-one countries have reached the HIPC completion point. Nine additional countries have passed the decision point and are working toward completion. Ten other countries carry unsustainable debts according to HIPC standards, but they have yet to reach the decision point. So far, the IMF and World Bank have approved $35 billion of HIPC debt relief. Five countries have received an additional $1.6 billion in &quot;topping up&quot; assistance since 2001.

<doc id="313534" wikidata="Q388721" url="?curid=313534" title="MD.45">
<text>MD.45 was an American heavy metal/punk rock band formed as a side project by Megadeth guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine and Fear vocalist Lee Ving. Bassist Kelly LeMieux (of Fear) and drummer Jimmy DeGrasso (of Y&amp;T and on a break from Alice Cooper, who later joined Megadeth) rounded out the band&#x27;s lineup.

== History ==
The band&#x27;s name was derived from Mustaine&#x27;s initials backwards (MD), combined with 45 which is derived from converting Ving&#x27;s backwards initials (VL) to their numerical value in Roman numerals which is 45.

The band released only one album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Craving&quot;. Many of the songs from the album were originally written for Megadeth, but due to the band almost breaking up, where Megadeth&#x27;s guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza at the time focused on their solo projects, Mustaine decided to start a side project instead.

On June 24, 2023, Megadeth and Lee Ving performed the song &quot;Nothing is Something&quot; live at a concert in Tampa, Florida. This marks the only time an MD.45 song has been performed live.

=== Remixing controversy ===
In 2004, while remixing the Megadeth catalog, Mustaine was offered US$ 250,000 by his-then record label Capitol Records to re-release the album. Mustaine omitted all vocals and harmonica parts from Ving. Instead, Mustaine himself recorded the vocals, and played guitar where the harmonica should have been. In his 2011 autobiography, Mustaine said:

In 2020, Ving publicly spoke about his disapproval, saying in a podcast that he was never consulted about the changes, and Mustaine didn&#x27;t contact him in any way. The remastered version was released by Capitol Records.

== Lineup ==
*Lee Ving – vocals, harmonica (original issue)
*Dave Mustaine – guitar (on both issues), vocals (on remastered issue)
*Kelly LeMieux – bass
*Jimmy DeGrasso – drums

;Other
*Michael Kaye – guitar/backline technician
*Billy Moss – studio engineer/vintage recorders

<doc id="313538" wikidata="Q161165" url="?curid=313538" title="Nepotism">
<text>Nepotism is the act of granting an advantage, privilege, or position to relatives and friends in an occupation or field. These fields can include business, politics, academia, entertainment, religion or health care. In concept it is similar to cronyism. The term originated with the assignment of nephews, sons, or other relatives to important positions by Catholic popes and bishops. It has often been witnessed in autocracies, whereby traditional aristocracies usually contested amongst themselves in order to obtain leverage, status, etc.

Nepotism has been criticized since ancient history by philosophers including Aristotle, Valluvar, and Confucius, condemning it as both evil and unwise.

== Origins ==

The term comes from Italian word &quot;nepotismo&quot;, which is based on Latin root &quot;nepos&quot; meaning nephew. Since the Middle Ages and until the late 17th century, some Catholic popes and bishops – who had taken vows of celibacy and, therefore, usually had no legitimate offspring of their own – gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to sons. They would also do the same with children who were the illegitimate result of broken celibacy vows, and who were claimed to be &quot;nephews&quot; instead of sons.

Several popes elevated nephews and other relatives to the cardinalate. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal &quot;dynasty&quot;. For instance, Pope Callixtus III, head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI. Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress&#x27;s brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III. Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two illegitimate grandsons, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull &quot;Romanum decet Pontificem&quot;, in 1692. The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.

===Mention in ancient literature===
In the second book of the Kural literature, which forms a manual for governments and corporations, Valluvar suggests about nepotism and favouritism thus: 
If you choose an unfit person for your job just because you love and you like him, he will lead you to endless follies. 
According to him, nepotism is both evil and unwise.

== Types ==
=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The British English expression &quot;Bob&#x27;s your uncle&quot; is thought to have originated when Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, promoted his nephew, Arthur Balfour, to the esteemed post of Chief Secretary for Ireland, which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.

===Economic===
Inheritance has been viewed by some as a form of nepotism.

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism in organizations leads to monopolization of power because when members involved in institutional decision-making are related, decisions made within institutions risk favoring a group of closely connected people.

Nepotism can also occur within organizations, when a person is employed due to their familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee. One of the consequences of nepotism in an organization is the creation of a limitation in the organization&#x27;s network of contacts, reducing the opportunities for negotiation with other social circles, which can lead to a reduction in the success and duration of organizations in the long term.

==== In employment ====
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining a job or being paid more than other similarly situated people. Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees, and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine stated &quot;there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name.&quot; Employing intimate people favors perpetuating the ideas or goals of those who employ them, knowing that the people around them will face up to them. However, it can lead to a lack of competent staff or a reduction in productivity because even if the employees are not the best options for their functions, they will be protected by those who employ them. Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive. Most Companies&#x27; Codes of Conduct include severe disciplinary sanction for Conflicts of Interest. However, in Nepotistic practices, these are rarely observed or implemented. 

====In entertainment====
Outside of national politics, accusations of &quot;nepotism&quot; are made in instances of &quot;prima facie&quot; favoritism to relatives.
* Peaches Geldof&#x27;s role as magazine editor in an MTV reality show – produced by a company owned by her father Bob Geldof
* Tori Spelling being cast on the TV series &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; as a result of her father Aaron Spelling&#x27;s involvement with the show
* Hollywood&#x27;s Coppola family includes many distinguished filmmakers and actors. The careers of Sofia Coppola, Nicolas Cage, and Jason Schwartzman have been attributed to aid by director Francis Ford Coppola. He cast his daughter Sofia in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;. Cage changed his last name to distance himself from such charges.
* Ben Platt&#x27;s role as high schooler Evan Hansen in the 2021 film adaptation of the musical &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot; as a result of his winning the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for originating the role on Broadway in 2016, as well as the involvement of his father, Marc Platt, as one of the film&#x27;s producers. The latter was never involved on the producing team of the stage version. The casting sparked controversy due to Ben Platt being ten years older than his character at the time of filming, resulting in critics and viewers deeming him too old to reprise his role. He would go on to be nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Actor, for his performance.
* &quot;New York&quot; magazine’s December 2022 cover (calling 2022 &#x27;The Year of the Nepo Baby&#x27;) featured notable celebrities (Maude Apatow, Lily-Rose Depp, Maya Hawke, Dakota Johnson, Ben Platt, Jack Quaid, Zoë Kravitz, and John David Washington) whose career successes have been achieved through nepotism.

====In sports====
* Thanasis Antetokounmpo has been labeled the beneficiary of nepotism due to his brother being Giannis Antetokounmpo, even though his play is deemed by some to not be good enough for him to occupy a roster spot on the Milwaukee Bucks.
* The Los Angeles Lakers encountered allegations of nepotism when they selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron James, in the 2024 NBA draft. Although other NBA prospects exemplified greater promise, experts questioned Bronny’s NBA readiness due to his lackluster performance during his only NCAA season. Reports revealed that LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, actively discouraged other teams from drafting Bronny, even going so far as to suggest that he might play overseas if selected.

==== In academia ====
Nepotism is in academia where it is common for professors to have their partners, and sometimes children, hired by the same faculty in which they work. In the second half of the 20th century, in the United States at least, this was far less frequent as universities typically held very strict anti-nepotism policies. Countries with high levels of corruption and higher education systems with low competition between universities are generally having higher levels of corruption in academia. Italy has been noted for having particularly high levels of nepotism in its academic system, when compared to other developed nations. Nepotism is often praised for favoring female employment in academia.

== Selected examples by country ==

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, nepotism is a common practice. Although there have been various attempts at reducing it, it is difficult in a country where state jobs are used as a token of gratitude or party favoritism.

Former president Mauricio Macri has been investigated for nepotism after allegedly extending a tax amnesty to his family.
Nonetheless, in 2018, the government of Mauricio Macri set a limit on nepotism through Decree 93/2018 establishing that &quot;appointments of people could no longer be made, under any modality, throughout the National Public Sector, who have some kinship link both in straight line as well as in a collateral line up to the second degree, with the President and Vice President of the Nation, Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministers and other officials with the rank and hierarchy of Minister. The spouse and the Cohabitant Union are included. &quot;

The Kirchnerist movement has been openly accused that it believes in nepotism, treating meritocracy as a pejorative concept. The government&#x27;s ministries and secretariats are reportedly plagued with friends, family and supporters of the current party leaders, many of whom have been criticized for being incompetent at their jobs.

On December 10, 2023, the libertarian president Javier Milei takes office – who campaigned criticizing the political &quot;caste&quot;, an entelechy built to denigrate traditional political parties and among whose characteristics is that of appointing friends and family to public positions on a discretionary basis – and in one of his first measures he modifies the Mauricio Macri&#x27;s Decree 93/2018 to be able to grant his sister, Karina Milei, the position of General Secretary of the Presidency. Less than two months later, Francisco Adorni, the brother of the government spokesperson Manuel Adorni, took a position as an advisor in the Ministry of Defense.

=== Australia ===
Shortly after his appointment as the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney in 2001, Peter Jensen was accused, in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview, of nepotism after nominating his brother Phillip Jensen as Dean of Sydney and appointing his wife Christine Jensen to an official position in the Sydney diocese.

Anna Bligh, who won the 2009 Queensland State election, has been accused of nepotism by giving her husband Greg Withers a position as the Office of Climate Change head.

Football Federation Australia was led by Frank Lowy from its inception in 2004 until his term limit exit in 2015. His son, Steven Lowy, who had little direct involvement in high level sports governance was nominated as his replacement by Frank, and was elected unopposed by a board strongly loyal to Frank. Steven&#x27;s introduction exacerbated existing governance issues, with factional opposition led by City Football Group causing FIFA intervention to be threatened. Eventually governance reforms were forced through despite opposition from the Lowy family, and it ended with Steven Lowy resigning from the role. Lowy had also been accused of nepotism regarding his sons in his corporate dealings as founder of Westfield Group.

=== Azerbaijan ===

On 21 February 2017, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev created the position of Vice President of Azerbaijan, then appointed his wife Mehriban Aliyeva to the position. Since 1993, the presidency of Azerbaijan has always been in the hands of a member of the Aliyev family: in 1993, Heydar Aliyev was elected president of Azerbaijan, and after his death in a United States hospital in 2003, his son Ilham Aliyev became president and has been since then. His regime has been accused for a lack of democratic freedoms and press freedom.

=== Belgium ===
Over the past decade, criticism has been growing over the creation of political dynasties in Belgium. This phenomenon has been explained by the fact that prominent party members control the ranking of candidates on party lists for elections and a candidate&#x27;s place on a list determines who is elected. Another justification for the phenomenon is the importance of name recognition for collecting votes.

Claims of nepotism have been made against Bruno Tobback, the son of senator and former minister Louis Tobback, a member of the Flemish socialists, became the Belgian federal government&#x27;s minister for the pensions and environment at 35 in 2005. Alexander De Croo, the son of former speaker of the Belgian parliament Herman De Croo, ran for the leadership of his father&#x27;s party Open VLD at age 33. Finally there is the example of Maya Detiège, the daughter of former mayor of the city of Antwerp Leona Detiège, who herself is the daughter of the former mayor of Antwerp Frans Detiège.
Among other examples are former minister Freya Van Den Bossche and senator Jean-Jacques De Gucht, being the daughter and son of respectively former minister Luc Vandenbossche and former minister Karel De Gucht.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, nepotism heavily affects the integrity of public institutions, including audit bodies responsible for overseeing executive decisions. Studies indicate that around 30% of audit judges are directly related to other politicians, creating a network of familial ties that can lead to conflicts of interest and reduce the effectiveness of independent oversight (Transparency International, 2023). This high rate of nepotism often results in biased audit outcomes, eroding public trust and obstructing fair governance. The presence of such familial networks within regulatory bodies not only compromises transparency but also perpetuates inefficiency and corruption, limiting reform efforts across Brazil’s political landscape (Instituto Não Aceito Corrupção, 2022).

=== Cambodia ===
Prime Minister Hun Sen and senior members of Parliament are known for their hand in getting family members into government positions. In the 2013 Cambodian parliamentary elections, at least eight candidates were sons of high-ranking Cambodian People&#x27;s Party officials. All sons of the ruling party lost but were eventually appointed into high-ranking government positions.

=== China ===

For the past 3,000 years, nepotism has been common in China&#x27;s clan and extended family-based culture. Confucius wrote about the importance of balancing &quot;filial piety with merit&quot;. The clan-based feudal system collapsed during Confucius&#x27; lifetime, yet nepotism has continued through the modern age.

=== France ===
In October 2009, Jean Sarkozy, the second son of the President of the French Republic Nicolas Sarkozy, was poised to become the director of the major authority despite lacking any higher education degree and professional experience. In 2008 he was voted regional councillor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the town of which his father had previously been mayor.

In September 2009, rap-producer Pierre Sarkozy, the first son of then-President Nicolas Sarkozy, asked for a financial contribution of around €10000 towards an €80000 artistic project. Because he was not a SCPP member, the request was automatically rejected. Pierre Sarkozy then went to the Élysée which led to an Élysée aide contacting the SCPP, and SCPP president Marc Guez assuring the issue would soon be favorably resolved. According to president and SCPP member Yves Riesel, however, this would not happen as SCPP&#x27;s financial help has been restricted to members only for months.

===Greece===
In Greece it is common practice for family members of current or former party leaders to be party members and get appointed as ministers when the party is in government. In addition, there have been three prime ministers from the Papandreou family, two from the Mitsotakis family (one currently serving), two from the Karamanlis family (a third one was serving as minister of transportation until February 2023, quitting his position following the worst rail disaster in the history of the country).

=== India ===

Nepotism in India is common in politics, judiciary, business, the film industry, religious circles, and many other types of organizations.

==== Nepotism in Indian politics ====

Since the 1980s, Indian politics has become dynastic, possibly due to the absence of elected party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for a party, and centralized financing of elections. One example of dynastic politics has been the Nehru–Gandhi family which produced three Indian prime ministers. Family members have also led the Congress Party for most of the period since 1978 when Indira Gandhi floated the then Congress(I) faction of the party. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also features several senior leaders who are dynasts. Dynastic politics is prevalent also in a number of political parties with regional presence such as Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference (JKNC), Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (JKPDP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(s)), Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), National People&#x27;s Party (NPP), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), Samajwadi Party (SP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SKD), Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) (SS(UBT)), Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP).

====Judiciary====
Many judges and advocates of the high courts and the Supreme Court of India are alleged to be appointed by exercising casteism, nepotism, and favoritism, primarily due to the Supreme Court and the high court appointment process called Collegium which recommends to the President, in a legally binding manner, the names of judges to be appointed or promoted to the higher judiciary. The various judicial services exams are also infamous for these practices.

==== Indian film industry ====

The Kapoor family, one of the most prolific generational families involved in Indian cinema, have been known for bringing their children into the industry with their endorsements and influence. In June 2020, a fresh debate on nepotism followed soon after the suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, which fans believe was in reaction to efforts by Bollywood insiders to boycott him. Filmmaker Karan Johar, who Rajput had worked with in the Netflix film &quot;Drive&quot; (2019), was quickly accused of nepotism by actress Kangana Ranaut, with Rajput&#x27;s fans calling for a boycott of Johar and his studio, Dharma Productions, as well as of actor Salman Khan and his brothers, who were accused of bullying outsiders in the past. Actors and actresses Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Janhvi Kapoor, Ishaan Khatter, Ananya Pandey, Athiya Shetty, Tiger Shroff, Arjun Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan, all of whom hail from film families, were also widely criticized.

===Indonesia===
Suharto, Indonesia&#x27;s second president, is involved in nepotism, alongside corruption and collusion (together, they are known as the &quot;KKN&quot; in ). Companies belonging to Suharto&#x27;s children, particularly Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (&quot;Tutut&quot;), Hutomo Mandala Putra (&quot;Tommy&quot;), and Bambang Trihatmodjo, were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the toll-expressway company Jasamarga (monopolized by Tutut), the national car project Timor (monopolized by Bambang and Tommy), and the cinema market (monopolized by 21 Cineplex, which is owned by Suharto&#x27;s cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about of real estate in Indonesia, including of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto&#x27;s family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia&#x27;s most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto&#x27;s ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish &quot;strategic partnerships&quot; with the former Indonesian president&#x27;s family companies.

=== Mauritius ===
Nepotism is common in Mauritian politics, with many relatives and friends of high-ranking politicians being appointed high-ranking positions and associated companies being granted government contracts.

Since the first democratic elections in 1948, the field of politics in Mauritius has been marked by a handful of families who have controlled the four major political parties which exist to this day. They are often referred to as the &quot;modern dynasties&quot; of Mauritian politics such as the Duval, Bérenger, Curé, Uteem, Mohamed, Boolell, Ramgoolam and Jugnauth families. The Boolell family&#x27;s involvement in politics started with Satcam Boolell in 1955, paving the way for his son Arvin Boolell, nephews Satish Boolell, Anil Gayan, and Sanjay Bhuckory, and son-in-law Sushil Kushiram to enter politics. The Duval dynasty started with ex-Lord mayor and minister Gaetan Duval, followed by his sons Xavier and Richard as well as grandson Adrien. Lall Jugnauth was the first of his clan to enter politics in the 1950s and was followed by his cousins Aneerood and Ashock as well as nephew Pravind. Abdool Razack Mohamed, who migrated from India in the 1930s, became Lord Mayor and minister; his son Yousuf and grandson Shakeel were also elected and served as ministers. Roshi Bhadain, who was a minister of the MSM government, is the nephew of former Labour Party minister Vasant Bunwaree. Roshi Bhadain and Akilesh Deerpalsing (Bhadain&#x27;s advisor and campaign manager, who is also the son of former minister Kishore Deerpalsing), were investigated by ICAC in 2019 for suspicious recruitment practices when he was a minister.

In March 2020 Harry Ganoo, the retired brother of Minister Alan Ganoo, was nominated as the new president du Civil Service College Mauritius a few months after the November 2019 General Elections.

Until mid-2020, construction company PAD &amp; Co. Ltd was awarded a string of major contracts such as constructing the new airport control tower, a new weather radar at Trou aux Cerfs, renovating the Bank of Mauritius, rehabilitating the coast line of Cap Malheurueux, renovating the Port Louis waterfront, upgrading roads, constructing the Harbour Cruise Terminal in Port Louis for the Mauritius Port Authority, and upgrading the navigation channels at Port Mathurin, Pointe La Gueule, and Baie aux Huîtres in Rodrigues, among other projects. PAD &amp; Co. Ltd&#x27;s owner, Alain Hao Thyn Voon, is the son of Philippe Hao Thyn Voon, president of the Olympic Committee, with close ties to the MSM. Following the St Louis gate scandal and discovery of fake bank guarantees, PAD &amp; Co. Ltd went under voluntary administration.

In June 2020, MP Eshan Juman revealed details of a contract between the Ministry of Land and Housing and a private firm called Smart Clinics Ltd. The firm is partly owned by MSM Parliamentary Private Secretary Ismaël Rawoo and his family. The contract was a lease of 60 years on 2 acres of prime beachfront state-owned land in Grande Rivière Noire, in the exclusive precinct of Tamarin in Black River. As part of the deal, Rawoo&#x27;s family will acquire the lease for Rs 15.05 million and will onsell the lease for Rs 250 million, generating a profit of around Rs 235 million.

In August 2020, V. Gobin, a 75-year-old retired schoolteacher and father of Attorney General Maneesh Gobin, was nominated as Chairman of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute and the Rabindranath Tagore Institute. Maneesh Gobin was elected to Parliament within the ruling MSM government in 2014 and 2019 and his father V. Gobin was elected once in 1987. A week earlier, Rishikesh Hurdoyal, the brother of MSM Minister of Civil Service Vikram Hurdoyal, was nominated as chairman and President of the Mauritius Shipping Corporation Ltd, in addition to being a director of the State Bank of Mauritius. The new nomination will allow Rishikesh Hurdoyal to receive an extra Rs 54,540 per month, as well as an additional Rs 10,125 per month as entertainment allowance, with access to a chauffeured company car with 245 litres of fuel per month.

=== Malaysia ===
The appointment of Nurul Izzah Anwar as a senior economic and finance advisor by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim resulted in accusations of nepotism. The action was widely criticized by intellectuals, NGOs and even parties member to the Pakatan Harapan coalition, who claimed it contravened principles of merit and fairness.

=== Malta ===

Due to its small native population, Malta has an entrenched culture of nepotism which became more evident since the country gained independence from the British Empire in 1964.

In a Eurobarometer survey published in 2023, 55% of Maltese businesses reported that nepotism and patronage were the primary problems they faced in their operations. Furthermore, 70% of Maltese businesses have also stated that close links between businessmen and politicians lead to corruption.

These rates were higher compared to those of other EU member states, of which only 37% (nepotism and patronage) and 35% (corruption) felt that such issues were problematic.

=== Romania ===
Romanian Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s family members &quot;dominated&quot; the country for decades. Elena Băsescu, the daughter of President Traian Băsescu, was elected in 2009 to the European Parliament, despite the fact that she had no significant professional or political experience.

=== Singapore ===

Singapore&#x27;s government has been the target of numerous charges of nepotism, with several members of the Prime Minister&#x27;s family holding high ranking posts. Lee Kuan Yew, who was prime minister from 1959 to 1990, preceded his son Lee Hsien Loong. Other family members holding high positions include the elder Lee’s daughter, Lee Wei Ling, the director of the National Neurological Institute, his other son, Lee Hsien Yang, the chief executive officer of Singapore Telecommunications from 1995 to 2007 and the younger Lee&#x27;s wife Ho Ching, who was appointed chief executive officer of state holding investment company Temasek Holdings. The family members dispute the charges as they arise.

=== Sri Lanka ===

Former President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has been accused of nepotism, appointing three brothers to run important ministries and giving out other political positions to relatives, regardless of their merit. During his presidency, the Rajapaksa family held the ministries of finance, defence, ports and aviation, and highways and road development. The president&#x27;s brother, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, was given the post of Defence Secretary. He also controlled the armed forces, the police and the Coast Guard, and was responsible for immigration and emigration. Rajapaksa appointed his brother Basil Rajapaksa as minister of Economic Development. Together, the Rajapaksa brothers controlled over 70% of Sri Lanka&#x27;s public budget. Mahinda Rajapaksa&#x27;s eldest brother, Chamal Rajapaksa, was appointed as the Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, and has held many other posts before, while his eldest son, Namal Rajapaksa, is also a member of the parliament and holds undisclosed portfolios.

Others include: his nephew, Shashindra Rajapaksa, who is the former Chief Minister of Uva; one of his cousins, former Sri Lankan ambassador to the United States, Jaliya Wickramasuriya; and another cousin, Udayanga Weeratunga, who is the former ambassador to Russia. Dozens of nephews, nieces, cousins, and in-laws have also been appointed as heads of banks, boards, and corporations.

Chandrika Kumaratunga, who served as the former President of Sri Lanka from 1994 to 2005 and former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in 1994, is the daughter of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and Sirimavo Bandaranaike who both served as Prime Ministers of Ceylon from 1956 to 1959, 1960 to 1965, 1970 to 1977 and 1994 to 2000. Her brother Anura Bandaranaike served as the Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka from 2000 to 2001

Also, former president Ranasinghe Premadasa&#x27;s son Sajith Premadasa is the Opposition leader of Sri Lanka who ran for presidential election in 2019 as well.

Also Ranil Wickremesinghe who served as prime minister of Sri Lanka from 1993 to 1994, 2001 to 2004, 2015 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 is a nephew of former Sri Lankan president J. R. Jayewardene. Also a defense state minister of his government Ruwan Wijewardene is also a cousin of Ranil Wickremesinghe. Also Ruwan is the great grandson of UNP founder and Sri Lanka&#x27;s first Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake. Ruwan has been given a high priority in the party by Ranil by giving leadership roles.

=== Spain ===
Nepotism occurred in Spanish Colonial America when offices were given to family members.

<text>The Chameleon (Dmitri Smerdyakov; Russian: Дмитрий Смердяков) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in the debut issue of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; in March 1963 as the first super-criminal to face the superhero Spider-Man. The Chameleon has since endured as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most recurring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

In the Marvel Universe, the Chameleon is a master of disguise who can impersonate virtually anyone. Throughout his comic book appearances, his abilities have stemmed from the use of lifelike masks, holographic technology, and mutagenic enhancement, while his role in Spider-Man stories has varied from being depicted as a spy, hitman, and criminal mastermind. The Chameleon is also the half-brother of Kraven the Hunter, and he has also been a member of the Sinister Six and the Sinister Twelve at various points in his history.

The character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including feature films, television series, video games. The character made his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019), portrayed by Numan Acar. Fred Hechinger appeared as the character in the Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film &quot;Kraven the Hunter&quot; (2024).

==Fictional character biography==
Dmitri Smerdyakov was born in Soviet Russia. In his youth, he became a servant to his half-brother Sergei Kravinoff, and later a minor associate of Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth by impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was soon exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Sergei (now known as &quot;Kraven the Hunter&quot;) came to the United States, and the Chameleon set his old associate&#x27;s sights on Spider-Man. Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues gallery.

The Chameleon inspired Kraven to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero. With Kraven, the Chameleon battled Iron Man, and then confronted the Hulk. At one point, the Chameleon disguised himself as Hank Pym, and robbed Pym&#x27;s laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. While delivering the documents and a shrunken Hulk to HYDRA, he was encountered and defeated by Ant-Man. The Chameleon also disguised himself as the Torpedo and battled Daredevil.

When his half-brother committed suicide, the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent this. He ingested a serum which made his face permanently featureless and malleable. He attempted to kidnap America&#x27;s leading expert on superconductors, but was thwarted by Spider-Man. He then kidnapped J. Jonah Jameson. He approached the Maggia for support to be New York&#x27;s new crime lord, and formed an alliance with Hammerhead. Disguised as a scientist, the Chameleon temporarily removed Spider-Man&#x27;s powers. He allied himself with the Femme Fatales, the Scorpion, and the Tarantula to eliminate Spider-Man and the Black Cat, but escaped when his plan failed.

The Chameleon&#x27;s most ambitious play against Spider-Man happened when he formed an alliance with Harry Osborn as the Green Goblin. Before Harry&#x27;s death, the Chameleon was told Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity could be found through Peter Parker, leading him to construct androids of Peter&#x27;s parents; the Chameleon later admitted that he went through with the plot to confirm once and for all that Peter was Spider-Man. The plan led to a psychotic breakdown for both Spider-Man and the Chameleon, with Spider-Man briefly renouncing the civilian identity while the Chameleon is sent to Ravencroft. When Ashley Kafka sneaks him into a basement to try to continue treating him, believing that he was close to a breakthrough when the court were preparing to put him on trial, the Chameleon escaped and attempted to convince Spider-Man that he was actually a hallucinating writer who had suffered a mental breakdown after his daughter&#x27;s death in a car accident; Peter managed to break through this deception due to his own strength of will. The Chameleon&#x27;s confirmation of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity led him to try to attack Spider-Man through family and friends, but this effort met with rather dismal results when Mary Jane Watson subdued him with a baseball bat. Somewhere in between this and subsequent appearances, he appeared to have been destroyed by his nephew Alyosha Kravinoff; Alyosha later threw a Chameleon mask at Spider-Man&#x27;s feet, referring to him as &#x27;that weakling Dmitri&#x27;, but he had apparently recovered, waking in a hospital.

After tricking Spider-Man to the bridge where Gwen Stacy&#x27;s death occurred on the pretext of having kidnapped Mary Jane, the Chameleon declared his own loneliness and love for Peter. When the surprise caused Peter to laugh nervously, the Chameleon threw himself off the bridge. He reappeared some time later in a mental institution, completely incapacitated and believing himself to be Sergei Kravinoff rather than his true self. He later reappeared in his Chameleon identity as part of the Sinister Twelve villain team organized by Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin.

After Spider-Man was unmasked, the Chameleon gathered a gang of villains called the Exterminators, including Will o&#x27; the Wisp, Scarecrow, Swarm, and Electro, and also blackmailed Molten Man into his employ all in an effort to defeat Spider-Man and attack the web-slinger&#x27;s family.

However, the Chameleon was dealt a most humiliating defeat by May Parker&#x27;s hands. When he attempted to trick May into believing he was Peter so he could murder her, May was not fooled and subdued the villain by tricking him into eating oatmeal-raisin cookies laced with Zolpidem. The Rhino was also employed as part of the team up and later defeated Spider-Man, only to be unable to collect payment since the Chameleon was already captured.

After the &quot;Civil War&quot;, the Chameleon showed up among the villains at Stilt-Man&#x27;s funeral at the Bar with No Name where the Punisher poisoned the drinks and blew up the bar.

The Chameleon next appeared in the newest incarnation of &quot;Super Villain Team-Up&quot; called MODOK&#x27;s Eleven. In this limited series, it is revealed that he contacted A.I.M. the moment he was telepathically summoned by MODOK. He then allowed A.I.M. to send in their newest creation, the Ultra-Adaptoid, under the guise of the Chameleon. Additionally, it was revealed in &quot;Super Villain Team-Up: MODOK&#x27;s Eleven&quot; that his apparent insanity and demise years earlier were in fact well-crafted ruses designed so that he could fade into the background once more.

The &quot;One More Day&quot; storyline ended with the removal of Peter and Mary Jane&#x27;s timeline from all memories, as well as knowledge of Spider-Man&#x27;s identity, including the Chameleon.

The Chameleon then returns to New York, more sadistic and sociopathic than ever before. To complete his hired goal of bombing City Hall, he kidnaps Peter and takes his place working for Mayor J. Jonah Jameson. While posing as Parker, he tries to better his life, revealing that he always tries to rectify the problems in the lives of his &quot;faces&quot;. Using Peter&#x27;s security clearance to get access to various materials, the Chameleon was poised to bomb City Hall before Peter escaped and thwarted his plans as Spider-Man. During the resulting confusion, the Chameleon escaped.

Sometime later at an alley building during &quot;The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt&quot; storyline, the distraught Chameleon is met by Sasha Kravinoff and Ana Kravinoff who want his help in avenging Sergei&#x27;s death. Various follow-up issues during &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; storyline show the Chameleon helping the Kravinoff family create an alliance of Spider-Man&#x27;s enemies as well as Diablo. First, he and Sasha managed to spring Electro from prison; Chameleon then approached Mysterio, stating that he has friends that are &quot;dying&quot; to meet him. During &quot;Grim Hunt&quot;, he posed as Ezekiel Sims to get close to Spider-Man, intending to defeat him and bring him to the Kravinoffs to sacrifice as part of a ritual that will revive Sergei. After Sergei is resurrected, the Chameleon states that the problem might stem from inward anger of being resurrected. He and the Kravinoffs discover Spider-Man&#x27;s corpse, which turns out to be Kaine in Spider-Man&#x27;s costume instead. The real Spider-Man soon arrives and takes revenge on the Kravinoff family, pulling the Chameleon and Alyosha into a huge nest of spiders; Sasha realizes that the Kravinoff family wasn&#x27;t hunting the spiders, but it was the spiders hunting them.

During the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; storyline, the Chameleon is invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team, where he is tasked with securing some specific items for Doctor Octopus. He poses as Harry Osborn to trick Spider-Man by telling him that Menace&#x27;s infant has died, when in reality the Chameleon had kidnapped the infant while Spider-Man was away. He delivers the child to Doctor Octopus, who claims that the baby is the first of a new species. Using a lead gained when he took down Shocker, Spider-Man arrives at the Kravinoff Mansion where he captures the Chameleon, who reveals that the baby is still alive and is in the Lizard&#x27;s clutches.

The Chameleon later becomes a member of Doctor Octopus&#x27;s latest incarnation of the Sinister Six. He poses as Steve Rogers to infiltrate an Air Force base. The Chameleon then disguises himself as a tribal chief when he and Mysterio pull off a zombie pirate attack on some indigenous peoples, using robots of the other Sinister Six members. Chameleon and Mysterio pulled off this scheme as a diversion so that Doctor Octopus and the other Sinister Six members could infiltrate the Baxter Building to look for specific technology plans, while the Future Foundation were investigating the more obvious threat.

The Chameleon later poses as Klaw to infiltrate Intelligencia so that he can help the Sinister Six steal their Zero Cannon.

During the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline, the Chameleon was present with the Sinister Six when Doctor Octopus tells them about his master plan. The Chameleon then appeared in the guise of Al Gore at Capitoline Hill, where a summit of the world&#x27;s leaders and greatest minds was held to discuss Doctor Octopus&#x27;s supposed offer to save the world. As Al Gore, the Chameleon stated that Doctor Octopus would save them, only to be unmasked when Spider-Man punches him and reveals his disguise, using a new costume that could detect the Chameleon based on his heartbeat. Both are interrupted by a transmission from Doctor Octopus, who activates the Octavian Lens blocking harmful UV rays from the sun to reinforce his offer. After letting the Chameleon go, Spider-Man secretly places a Spider-Tracer on the Chameleon so that the Avengers could follow him; they track the Chameleon to the Mediterranean Coasts, where the Sinister Six is waiting for him and successfully subdue the Avengers, leaving only Spider-Man standing. After Spider-Man and the Black Widow escape with Silver Sable&#x27;s help, the Chameleon suggests that since the Sinister Six&#x27;s remaining members had each received their $2 billion and had their criminal records expunged, they should just leave Doctor Octopus and his scheme; the others elect to stay on board, rather than make an enemy of Otto. The Chameleon later gets involved with Mysterio in tricking Spider-Man&#x27;s allies into thinking they were destroying Symkaria to give Doctor Octopus more time to complete the 200 satellites. However, the Chameleon is captured and the Black Widow threatens to reveal the secret behind his real face.

Following the &quot;Dying Wish&quot; storyline, the Chameleon later fights Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius&#x27;s mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body) and the Secret Avengers on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The Chameleon ends up knocked unconscious, and the Superior Spider-Man transports him to his hidden underwater lab where he ends up imprisoned. The Chameleon, Electro, Sandman, Mysterion, and the Vulture are later seen as part of the &quot;Superior Six&quot; team. The Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds to redeem them for their crimes, forcing them to risk their lives doing heroic deeds against their will, then bringing them back to their containment cells after. They eventually break free of the Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s control and attempt to exact revenge, nearly destroying New York to do so. With Sun Girl&#x27;s help, the Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.

Following the true Spider-Man&#x27;s return, the Chameleon attempts to drive Spider-Man insane as revenge for the Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s earlier treatment of him. However, Deadpool switches costumes with Spider-Man, with the Chameleon unaware of this. He fails at driving Deadpool insane (as Deadpool is already insane), and ends up being shot in the leg by him. Both Spider-Man and Deadpool (in each other&#x27;s costumes) then punch the Chameleon at the same time, knocking him out, and later deliver him to the authorities.

At the conclusion of the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, the Chameleon is revealed to be one of the attendees at Sergei&#x27;s funeral, pleased that Sergei spared him from the Great Hunt. As he walks away, the Chameleon bids the deceased Sergei a good rest: &quot;You needn&#x27;t worry. The world is no longer your burden. Besides, there won&#x27;t be much of it left soon... Not by the time I&#x27;ve finished.&quot;

During the &quot;Chameleon Conspiracy&quot; storyline, Chameleon was imprisoned in a Symkarian black site prison called the Hiding Place when Teresa Parker infiltrated it, planning to interrogate him about his connection with Harry Osborn and the use of the Life Model Decoys of her parents. Teresa dragged Chameleon to another cell where Finisher - her parents&#x27; killer, who is still alive after his apparent death at the hands of Spider-Man - is being held, leading Chameleon to claim that he has the answers she needs. Teresa non-fatally shoots Finisher to ensure both men&#x27;s compliance. Chameleon and Finisher admitted to Teresa that Chameleon faked Finisher&#x27;s death to fool Spider-Man; upon relocating them to another building, Finisher is shown to have a plethora of people resembling Chameleon, unsettling him. As Spider-Man finds that some of the Jack O&#x27;Lanterns were unmasked to be Chameleon-like people, Finisher revealed to Teresa that Chameleon was adopted at a young age by Gustav Fiers. Then Chameleon revealed that they never left the Hiding Place: Finisher was using holographic technology to speak with Teresa, and Chameleon states that she can use the Clairvoyant to find the rest of the answers she needs, all the while claiming that she may be a Chameleon double agent herself. Upon meeting up with Spider-Man, Teresa rejects Chameleon&#x27;s insinuations and breaks the Clairvoyant, believing that she is a Parker first and foremost, and makes plans to track down Finisher. Back in his cell, the Chameleon is approached by Kindred, who seeks to procure more serum, and Chameleon states that he is happy to do business with Osborn again.

==Powers and abilities==
The Chameleon originally had no superhuman abilities. He simply used makeup and elaborate costuming to impersonate his targets. He implemented a device in a belt buckle that emitted a gas that helped him mold his features. He later obtained a microcomputer from Spencer Smythe for his belt buckle that could be programmed with the facial features of hundreds of people. The belt buckle also contains a video receiver that enables the computer to analyze the appearance of anyone the Chameleon encounters so that it can duplicate their features using electrical impulses. The computer utilizes holographic technology that allows him to change his appearance at the push of a button. His electronic devices allowed him to simultaneously appear as two different people to two separate observers. The Chameleon&#x27;s costume consists of &quot;memory material&quot; that can be altered by electrical impulses from his belt to resemble the clothing of the person he is impersonating.

The character&#x27;s powers were later made innate. His skin pigmentation have been surgically and mutagenically altered by a serum so that he can take on the appearance of any person at will. He also wears fabric made of memory material that responds to nerve impulses and can appear to be whatever costume he wishes to be. The Chameleon had taken the same serums that Kraven had taken over the years.

Additionally, the Chameleon is a master of disguise and a brilliant method actor. He is also an expert impressionist and a master of creating lifelike masks and make-up. He is a quick-change artist who can assume a new disguise in less than a minute, although he no longer needs to use such skills. The character also speaks several languages fluently. Although the Chameleon is not a scientific genius, during his increased lifespan he has been exposed to a wide array of sophisticated experimental technology, much of which he can apply in his schemes.

==Reception==
Bradley Prim of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called the Chameleon one of Spider-Man’s &quot;iconic villains.&quot; Tom Bowen of &quot;Game Rant&quot; ranked him 12th in their &quot;28 Best Spider-Man Villains Of All Time&quot; list. Scoot Allan of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked Dmitri Smerdyakov 5th in their &quot;10 Most Iconic Spider-Man Villains&quot; list, writing, &quot;The Chameleon quickly became one of Spider-Man’s most personal and iconic villains after Kraven’s suicide turned Smerdyakov vengeful.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Chameleon 14th in their &quot;Top 25 Spider-Man Villains&quot; list, stating, &quot;The fact that he’s been such a mainstay of Spidey’s rogues gallery ever since is a testament to his enduring appeal.&quot;

<text>On November 2, 1948, two squads of Israel Defense Forces soldiers captured an encampment of Bedouins at Khirbat al-Wa&#x27;ra al-Sawda&#x27; in the eastern Galilee. While some soldiers guarded the Arabs, others went to a nearby hilltop where the headless bodies of two Israeli soldiers were found. In retaliation, the Arabs&#x27; dwellings were destroyed and 15 or 16 adult males were shot, 14 of whom died.

Most of the victims were members of the &#x27;Arab Al-Mawasi clan. Their bodies were buried in a cave adjacent to the place where they were killed. In the 1950s, the Israeli National Water Project was dug through the cave, and the Mawasi people took the bones to another cave. During the 1980s the bones were moved to a common grave in the Muslim cemetery in Eilabun.

<doc id="313550" wikidata="Q6263470" url="?curid=313550" title="John Welsh of Ayr">
<text>John Welsh (–1622) was a Scottish Presbyterian leader. He was born in Dumfriesshire and attended the University of Edinburgh to obtain his MA in 1588. He became a minister in Selkirk and married Elizabeth Knox, a daughter of John and Margaret Knox, before leaving Selkirk. Welsh later ministered at Kirkcudbright and Ayr, the latter of which was where he spent five years. His preaching resulted in his imprisonment by the order of King James VI of Scotland. The lawyer Thomas Hamilton wrote to James VI about Welsh, John Forbes, and others; the case was important because many Scottish subjects of James were devoted to the ministers. In 1606 Welsh was exiled to France, where he continued to preach. John Welsh of Ayr was the father of Josias Welsh and the grandfather of John Welsh of Irongray.

==Life==

John Welsh was the son of the laird of Collieston (or Colliston), and was born in the parish of Dunscore, Dumfriesshire around 1570. When he was young he ran away from home and joined a band of border reivers. After he learned being a reiver was less glamorous than expected, he sought reconciliation with his father, and was sent to the University of Edinburgh, where he obtained an MA in 1588. On 6 March 1589 he was nominated by the Privy Council as one of three people for maintaining the true religion in the Forest and Tweeddale, and was settled at Selkirk. In 1594 he was transferred to Kirkcudbright, and on 29 March 1596 he was appointed one of the visitors for Nithsdale, Annandale, Lauderdale, Eskdale, and Ewesdale.

On 18 December, while occupying the pulpit of St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Welsh preached against King James VI of Scotland&#x27;s conduct shortly after the Presbyterians revolted against the king. He &quot;[alleged] that his majesty was possessed of a devil, and after the outputting of that devil there joined to his highness seven devils, quhilk was his majesty&#x27;s council&quot;; and that as it was lawful for a son to bind a lunatic father, it was equally lawful &quot;to his highness&#x27;s subjects to bind his majesty, being in the like case&quot;. After failing to answer the charge of having justified the tumult, Welsh was denounced as a rebel on 17 January (ib.). On the petition of the assembly in the following March he was, mainly through the intervention of Lord Ochiltree (Moysie, Memoirs, p. 133), allowed to return to his charge.

Welsh was re-appointed as one of the visitors for Nithsdale at the assembly held at Montrose in March 1599 (Calderwood, vi. 23), and in August of the same year, he was transferred to the parish of Ayr as an assistant to John Porterfield. When he arrived he succeeded in quelling feuds and riots, and effected the reformation in public manners. His preaching attracted crowds such that the town council resolved to build a new church on 26 May 1603. He succeeded Porterfield after the latter died in 1604.

Although Welsh did not arrive in Aberdeen until two days after the July 1605 General Assembly had been held, he was ordered to become a ward or prisoner in Blackness Castle. As they had put in a declinature of the jurisdiction of the council in the matter the king decided to put them on trial for high treason, which was done at an assize held at Linlithgow, the majority was declared guilty. The punishment for high treason was normally death, but by the king&#x27;s direction the sentence was commuted on 23 October 1606 to perpetual banishment from the king&#x27;s dominion, and they were commanded to board a ship on 1 November that sailed from Leith to Bordeaux.

When Welsh arrived in France he immediately began to learn the French language, and within fourteen weeks he was able to preach in French. Shortly afterwards he became the pastors of the Protestant churches of Nerac, Jonsac, and eventually Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély in Saintonge, where he remained for sixteen years. The town council of Ayr continued to regularly remit his stipend as minister of the parish to him for several years after his banishment.

When Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély, a strongly fortified town, was besieged by King Louis XIII during the war against the Protestants in 1620, Welsh encouraged the citizens to form a resistance and helped operate the guns on the walls. After the town surrendered, he continued to preach as usual until he was summoned before the king, who reprimanded him for violating the law forbidding anyone from providing religious services other than the standard. Welsh replied that if the king knew what he preached he would himself both come to hear him and make all his subjects do the same, for what he preached was that there was none on earth above the king, which none who had adhered to the pope would say. His answer impressed the king, who answered, &quot;Very well, father, you shall be my minister&quot;, and promised him his protection. When the town was captured again in the following year, the king ordered guards to be placed around the house of Welch and provided horses and wagons to convey him, his family, and his household goods to Rochelle in safety.

Welsh never returned to his charge and went to Zealand. He sent a petition to King James asking for permission to return to his native country, and obtained the freedom to go to London. Through John Young, Dean of Winchester, an attempt was unsuccessfully made to obtain a general approval of episcopacy from Welsh. When Welsh&#x27;s wife went to King James to ask his remission, the king answered that he would pardon him if she would induce him to submit to the bishops. She replied that she would rather receive his severed head in her lap. On hearing that Welsh would die soon, the king granted his request for permission to preach in London. He died on 2 April 1622, two hours after concluding the services. He was survived by his wife Elizabeth, youngest daughter of John Knox the reformer, and four sons and two daughters, of whom Josias became minister of Temple Bar, or Temple Patrick, Ireland. Jane Welsh, the wife of Thomas Carlyle, claimed descent from Welsh.

<text>John Michael Welsh of Irongray (c. 1624–1681) was a leader of the Scottish Covenanter movement. Dunlop, an early 20th century writer, says: &quot;It is a noteworthy fact that there exists no memoir of John Welsh of Irongray, though from the Battle of Rullion Green till Bothwell Bridge he was the most conspicuous Covenanting minister in Scotland. Had he &quot;glorified God in the Grassmarket&quot;, or fallen in some scuffle with Claverhouse&#x27;s dragoons, or even like his friend Blackadder of Troqueer languished in prison on the Bass Rock, some pious hand would have been moved to write his story.&quot; Dunlop also wrote: &quot;The events of Welsh&#x27;s life must be sought for in the pages of Wodrow and Kirkton and in the letters and State papers of the reign of Charles II. After spending a fortnight hunting him in the British Museum, I have come to sympathise with Clavers and his dragoons. Mr John Welsh is a most elusive gentleman.&quot;

==Early life and ministry==

John Welsh was born, probably in 1624, son of Josias Welsh, minister at Templepatrick, County Antrim, grandson of John Welsh of Ayr, and great-grandson of John Knox. He graduated with an M.A. from Glasgow University in 1647, and was admitted to Irongray on the Cluden Water, Dumfrieshire, on 21 January 1653. At the instance of a heritor, David M&#x27;Brear of Newark and Almagill, M.P. for the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, he was accused before the Privy Council, June 1662, of having called Middleton&#x27;s Parliament &quot;a drunken Parliament&quot;, but was acquitted since the witnesses&#x27; testimony did not agree. Soon after the restoration of Episcopacy he was deprived. His congregation used force to prevent a new minister being settled. The Privy Council imposed their will with increased force. It was probably in February, 1663, that John Welsh was outed from Irongray. He seems to have sought refuge with John Neilson of Corsack, where other outed preachers, Gabriel Semple of Kirkpatrick-Durham and Blackadder of Troqueer also found shelter. Ejected ministers were forbidden to reside within twenty miles of their parishes, six miles of Edinburgh or any cathedral church, or three miles of any royal burgh. &quot;Conditions which,&quot; as Wodrow remarks, &quot; the nicest geographer would find hard to satisfy.&quot; They were pretty nearly satisfied in Welsh&#x27;s case. At Corsack Welsh&#x27;s first wife died. (Wodrow ii., 4, 5, 6, Veitch&#x27;s Memoirs, Blackadder 24.) It was probably too at Corsack that Welsh penned his pamphlet, &quot; Fifty and Two Directions to Irongray.&quot;

==Field preaching and Rullion Green==
Welsh was among the first who decided to preach in the fields against law, indeed, he is credited with being the inventor of the field conventicles of the Covenanters. In January, 1666, he was proclaimed for this, along with Semple and Blackadder, by the Privy Council. &quot;Particularly the said Mr John Welsh does presume frequently, at least once every week, to preach in the parish of Irongray in the Presbytery of Dumfries, and himself and those who frequent his conventicles do convene together armed with swords and pistols; at which meetings he also baptizes children which are brought to him by disaffected persons.&quot;

He is recorded as giving communion to between 3000 and 6000 people along with John Blackadder at Bishop&#x27;s Forest, Irongray. There is a monument and Communion Stones at Skeoch Hill.

He was probably the first of the field-preachers; was concerned in the Pentland Rising, and fled before Dalyell&#x27;s troopers at Rullion Green. Welsh was at the battle, and left it with the insurgent leader, Colonel Wallace. Whether he fled with Wallace to Holland is not known, but for nearly two years we hear nothing about him. Two parishioners and namesakes of Welsh were present at the battle, Welsh of Skaar and Welsh of Cornlee. They were among those who were exempted from the indemnity after Pentland.

==A wanted man==
In 1667 he was hiding in a friend&#x27;s house in Edinburgh, but soon afterwards he ventured into Clydesdale. 
Welsh may have found shelter in his own parish, but probably he was nearer his pursuers than they imagined; at 
any rate in 1668 he was lurking at the house of one Robert Grey in Edinburgh. (Kirkton, 1668.) Towards the end of the year he was preaching. The Earl of Tweeddale writes in November, 1668, to the Earl of Lauderdale that Mr John Welsh was running about Clydesdale and keeping conventicles both in houses and in the Church of Cambusnethan.

==In Fife==
He preached in Fife to large crowds drawn from all classes. On one occasion, John Welsh preached to a large crowd at Kinkell, near St Andrews.

Philip Standfield, son of Sir James Standfield and a student at St Andrews University, attended the sermon and threw some missile that struck the preacher. Welsh said &quot;I do not know who has put this public affront on Christ; but, be he who he may, there shall be more at his death than hearing me preach today&quot;. This turned out to be true, for the young man was later hanged for murdering his father.

==In Northern England==
Robert Traill spent much time with him. When in England he spent some time in Carlisle.
In August 1671 he was in Northumberland, where, says Wodrow, &quot; he dwelt for some time very pleasantly.&quot; He preached &quot;when Tweed was frozen in the midst of the river, that either he might shun the offence of both nations, or that two kingdoms might dispute his crime.&quot;
In 1677 he dispensed the Communion at Skeochhill, in Irongray, where the &quot;Communion Stones&quot; are still pointed out. He was present at Drumclog and Bothwell Bridge.

==Return to Scotland==
In the spring of 1677 Welsh and other Covenanting preachers wece back in Scotland. With Blackader and 
Riddel he held a communion at Eckford in Teviotdale.

==In London==
About 1679 he went to London, where he died on 9 January 1681, and was buried in St Botulph Churchyard, Bishopsgate. In a note of Miss Foxcroft to the supplement to 
Burnet&#x27;s History (p. 103) it stated that he lived principally with Shaftesbury after Bothwell Bridge, and may thus have supplied Burnet with materials for his History.

His death caused no small stir in London. Lord Fountainhall mentions it in his Diary, adding : – &quot;He was not so 
gross as to disown the King, as the Cameronians did: his grandfather, Mr John Welsh, was a great enemy of the 
bishops, and died in France.&quot; Wodrow, on the authority of a son of Hamilton of Kinkell, says that &quot;Mr Welsh&#x27;s burial was the greatest that for many years had been seen in London; that most of the Dissenters changed their 
text that Sabbath he was buried; that their congregations were invited to the burial, at which there was a vast number of ministers, persons of fashion, and, if my memory fails me not, some hundreds of coaches.&quot;

==Family life==
He married his first wife at Holyrood, on 18 February 1653, Elizabeth Somerville, who died at Corsock. He then remarried in 1674, a lady whose name is unknown.

Son: Edward Alexander Welsh md (married) Sarah Gaines: Grandson: Robert Alexander Welsh md Judith Barr: Great Grandson: John Robert Welsh md Anne Elizabeth Heggerty: 2nd Great Grandson: William Patrick Welsh md Johanna Cloughlan: 3rd Great Grandson Michael Patrick Welsh md Mary Ann Dunn.

<text>Gush Dan (, ) or Tel Aviv metropolitan area is a conurbation in Israel, located along the country&#x27;s Mediterranean coastline. There is no single formal definition of Gush Dan, though the term is in frequent use by both governmental bodies and the general public. It ranges from combining Tel Aviv with cities that form an urban continuum with it, to the entire areas from both the Tel Aviv District and the Central District, or sometimes the whole Metropolitan Area of Tel Aviv, which includes a small part of the Southern District as well. Gush Dan is the largest conurbation and metropolitan area in Israel and the center of Israel&#x27;s financial and High technology sector. The metropolitan area having an estimated population of 4,156,900 residents, 89% of whom are Israeli Jews.

==History==
The name &quot;Gush Dan&quot; means &quot;Dan Bloc&quot;, and is so named because the area was the territory of the tribe of Dan in the ancient Kingdom of Israel. According to the biblical narrative, the tribe had originally tried to settle in the central coastal area of Canaan, but enmity with the Philistines, who had already settled there, caused it to be able to camp only in the hill country overlooking the Sorek Valley. The camp location became known as Mahaneh Dan (&quot;Camps of Dan&quot;). The region that they attempted to settle included the area as far north as Jaffa and as far south as Shephelah in the area of Timnah. As a result of the pressure from the Philistines, the tribe abandoned hopes of settling near the central coast and instead migrated to the north of the country. After conquering Laish, the tribe refounded it as its capital and renamed it Dan. In remembrance of the original territory assignments, the coastal region is referred to as Gush Dan. The modern city of Tel Aviv was founded in 1909 as a suburb of the Arab-majority coastal city of Jaffa.

The city of Tel Aviv grew rapidly in the ensuing decades by Jewish immigration from Europe, with its population reaching 150,000 in 1934, and 230,000 when Israel gained its independence in 1948. Before the establishment of Israel, other towns in the Gush Dan were founded as well, such as Petah Tikva in 1878, Rishon LeZion in 1882, Ness Ziona in 1883, Rehovot in 1890, and most other Gush Dan cities were established before 1948.

In 1947, the Jewish population of the Gush Dan was nearly 400,000 and was the majority of the Jewish population of Mandatory Palestine. As such, almost all of it was included in the Jewish state proposed by the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Arab population of the region, which had been nearly 150,000 before the war, was reduced to around 10,000. They were quickly replaced by a larger number of Jews fleeing from postwar Europe and persecution in Arab countries.

However, many new immigrants did not then come to Tel Aviv. In the 1950s, towns were built on the edges of the Gush Dan, including Ashdod, Rosh HaAyin and Yavne. The nation&#x27;s sole port was then located in the northern city of Haifa and its evolving metropolitan area, making that city at least as important as Tel Aviv. The new government was then trying to disperse the nation&#x27;s population to the periphery and discouraged settlement in the already-populated Gush Dan. That slowed the growth of the Gush Dan, but the area still more than doubled in population within 20 years of the establishment of Israel. The opening of the Port of Ashdod in the southern Gush Dan also increased the area&#x27;s importance, with the importance of Haifa diminishing and that of Tel Aviv increasing because of its proximity. Tel Aviv itself witnessed population decreases in the 1970s and 1980s, when outer regions of the Gush Dan with lower costs of living absorbed many of the people who had left Tel Aviv.

Only in the 1990s, with the immigration of more than 1 million Jews from former Soviet Republics, 40,000 Ethiopian Jews, and many others to Israel, as well as a boom in the religious population, would Tel Aviv begin to grow again. The demand for housing increased dramatically, with new cities such as Modiin and El&#x27;ad being built, and cities like Ashdod more than doubling in population, from 83,000 in 1990, to 175,000 in 2000. In the 2000s, the area continued to grow, attracting many immigrants from the Haifa metropolitan area. With a population of 4,052,200 people as of 2019, Gush Dan is home to the commercial, economical, cultural, and industrial center of Israel.

The Tel Aviv urban conurbation, stretching from Netanya to Ashdod, concentrates the largest Jewish population globally, nearing 3.9 million Jews. This figure significantly surpasses the Jewish population of the New York metropolitan area, which ranks second with 2.1 million Jews. Despite some successes in ongoing attempts by the Israeli government to encourage migration to the Galilee and the Negev, Gush Dan retains its position as the heart of Israel.

==Metropolitan rings==
Israel Central Bureau of Statistics divides the Tel Aviv metropolitan area into four:

==Business and commercial districts==

*Diamond Exchange District – Ramat Gan – The Diamond Exchange District is in the city of Ramat Gan. Bordering the Ayalon Highway, the road dividing Ramat Gan and Tel Aviv, the district is home to Israel&#x27;s diamond industry as well as being a major commercial center. The Diamond Exchange itself contains four buildings (towers) connected by bridges; the Maccabi Tower, Shimshon Tower, Noam Tower, and Diamond Tower, which contains the world&#x27;s largest diamond trading floor and is the main building of the Diamond Exchange. The district also has a number of other important buildings. The Moshe Aviv Tower is Israel&#x27;s second tallest (and formerly its tallest) building at 244 meters. Opposite, Exchange Ramat Gan is currently under construction, set to include a pair of skyscrapers and a commercial area between them. The Sheraton City Tower is a hotel in the district, whilst other notable buildings are the Ayalon Tower and Gibor Sport House.
*Dizengoff Square – Tel Aviv – Dizengoff Center () is a shopping mall in central Tel Aviv, host to about 140,000 visitors weekly. Lying south of Dizengoff Square, it is named for Meir Dizengoff, the first mayor of Tel Aviv. The first mall in Tel Aviv, the center opened in 1983. It is divided into two parts and straddles both sides of Dizengoff Street with the two parts linked by a pair of skywalks. The mall is bordered by Dizengoff Street, King George Street and the smaller Tchernichovsky street.
*Port of Ashdod – Ashdod – The Port of Ashdod is one of Israel&#x27;s two main cargo ports. The port is located in Ashdod, about 40 kilometers south of Tel Aviv, adjoining the mouth of the Lachish River. Its establishment doubled the country&#x27;s port capacity.
*Rothschild Boulevard – Tel Aviv – Rothschild Boulevard (, &quot;Sderot Rothschild&quot;) is a street in Tel Aviv beginning in Neve Tzedek at its southwestern edge and running north to Habima Theatre. It is one of the busiest and most expensive streets in the Gush Dan, being one of the city&#x27;s main tourist attractions.
*Azrieli Center – Tel Aviv – Azrieli Center is a complex of skyscrapers in Tel Aviv. At the base of the center lies a large shopping mall. The center was originally designed by Israeli-American architect Eli Attia, and after he fell out with the developer of the center David Azrieli (after whom it is named), completion of the design was passed on to the Tel Aviv firm of Moore Yaski Sivan Architects.
*Tel Aviv Stock Exchange – Tel Aviv – The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE; ; colloquially known as the &quot;Boursa&quot;) is Israel&#x27;s only stock exchange. The TASE is the only public market for trading securities in Israel. It plays a major role in the Israeli economy. TASE lists some 622 companies, about 60 of which are also listed on stock exchanges in other countries. TASE also lists some 180 exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 60 government bonds, 500 corporate bonds, and more than 1000 mutual funds. 29 companies are members of the TASE, of which 14 are banks. The list of members indicates that Altshuler Shaham Ltd is a candidate for membership.
*Tel Aviv Promenade – Tel Aviv – The Tel Aviv promenade runs along its beaches, and is an integral part of the city&#x27;s lifestyle, as well as a major tourist attraction. Most of the city&#x27;s bathing beaches and hiking paths are concentrated in the central part of its 14 kilometers of Mediterranean shore. It contains numerous hotels and commercial buildings.

==Transportation==
The Dan Bus Company is primarily focused on serving the Gush Dan, although it is being replaced by the Kavim company in many of the Gush Dan&#x27;s cities. Much of Israel&#x27;s national highway network feeds into the area, such as Highway 1, Highway 2, Highway 4, and Highway 5. Gush Dan is also served by the local Ayalon Highway. Israel Railways, the state owned, national rail network provider, also feeds most traffic into or within the Gush Dan region. The Tel Aviv Light Rail is also a major feature in the regions transport, as well as the high speed service to Jerusalem. Two airports are located in the Gush Dan; Sde Dov Airport which closed at 2019, and Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod which is Israel&#x27;s largest airport handles over 22 million passengers a year and offers flights to destinations in Europe, Africa, Asia, and The Americas. The Tel Aviv Metro is a planned subway system to the region which will feature three lines, with the first public opening planned in 2032.

==Highways==
Some of the major freeways/expressways carrying commuter traffic in and out of the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area are:

*Highway 20 (also called Ayalon Freeway) – a major intracity freeway in Gush Dan, which runs along Tel Aviv&#x27;s center eastern border from north to south.
*Highway 1 – connects Tel Aviv with Jerusalem.
*Highway 2 (also called The Coastal Highway) – stretches from Tel Aviv to Haifa. It is one of the busiest highways in Israel.
*Highway 4 (also called Geha Highway, or First President Road) – a major north–south highway connecting Ra&#x27;anana and Kfar Saba in the North to Petah Tikva and Ramat Gan in the center and Ashdod in the South.
*Highway 5 – connects the Mediterranean coast immediately north of Tel Aviv with the central Sharon plain and Ariel and other Israeli settlements in the northern West Bank.
*Highway 44 – connects Tel Aviv with Ramla, Lod and the Shefela.

<text>Cognitivism is the meta-ethical view that ethical sentences express propositions and can therefore be true or false (they are truth-apt), which noncognitivists deny. Cognitivism is so broad a thesis that it encompasses (among other views) moral realism (which claims that ethical sentences express propositions about mind-independent facts of the world), ethical subjectivism (which claims that ethical sentences express propositions about peoples&#x27; attitudes or opinions), and error theory (which claims that ethical sentences express propositions, but that they are all false, whatever their nature).

==Overview==
Propositions are what meaningful declarative sentences (but not interrogative or imperative sentences) are supposed to &quot;express&quot;. Different sentences, in different languages, can express the same proposition: &quot;snow is white&quot; and &quot;Schnee ist weiß&quot; (in German) both express the proposition that snow is white. A common belief among philosophers who use this jargon is that propositions, properly speaking, are what are true or false (what bear truth values; they are truthbearers).

To get a better idea of what it means to express a proposition, compare this to something that &quot;does not&quot; express a proposition. Suppose someone minding a convenience store sees a thief pick up a candy bar and run. The storekeeper manages to exclaim, &quot;Hey!&quot; In this case, &quot;Hey!&quot; does not express a proposition. Among the things that the exclamation does not express are, &quot;that&#x27;s a thief there&quot;; &quot;thieving is wrong&quot;; &quot;please stop that thief&quot;; or &quot;that thief really annoys me.&quot; The storekeeper isn&#x27;t saying anything that can be true or false. So it is not a &quot;proposition&quot; that the storekeeper is expressing. Perhaps it is an &quot;emotional state&quot; that is being expressed. The storekeeper is surprised and angered, and expresses those feelings by saying, &quot;Hey!&quot;

Ethical cognitivists hold that ethical sentences &quot;do&quot; express propositions: that it can be true or false, for example, that Mary is a good person, or that stealing and lying are always wrong. Cognitivists believe that these sentences do not just express feelings, as though we were saying, &quot;Hey!&quot; or &quot;Yay for Mary!&quot;; they actually express propositions that can be true or false. Derivatively, a cognitivist or a realist would say that ethical sentences themselves are either true or false. Conversely, if one believes that sentences like &quot;Mary is a good person&quot; cannot be either true or false, then one is a non-cognitivist.

==Cognitivism and subjectivism==

Ethical subjectivism is the meta-ethical view which claims that:
# Ethical sentences express propositions.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are about the attitudes of people.

This makes ethical subjectivism a form of cognitivism. Ethical subjectivism stands in opposition to moral realism, which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to error theory, which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to non-cognitivism, which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all.

The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of moral relativism, with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. cultural relativism), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by Protagoras, holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world. However, there are also universalist forms of subjectivism such as ideal observer theory (which claims that moral propositions are about what attitudes a hypothetical ideal observer would hold) and divine command theory (which claims that moral propositions are about what attitudes God holds).

==Cognitivism and objectivism==

Cognitivism encompasses all forms of moral realism, but cognitivism can also agree with ethical irrealism or anti-realism. Aside from the subjectivist branch of cognitivism, some cognitive irrealist theories accept that ethical sentences can be objectively true or false, even if there exist no natural, physical or in any way real (or &quot;worldly&quot;) or objects to make them true or false.

There are a number of ways of construing how a proposition can be objectively true without corresponding to the world:
* By the coherence rather than the correspondence theory of truth
* In a figurative sense: it can be true that I have a cold, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the word &quot;cold&quot; corresponds to a distinct entity.
* In the way that mathematical statements are true for mathematical anti-realists. This would typically be the idea that a proposition can be true if it is an entailment of some intuitively appealing axiom—in other words, &quot;a priori&quot; analytical reasoning.

Crispin Wright, John Skorupski and some others defend normative cognitivist irrealism. Wright asserts the extreme implausibility of both J. L. Mackie&#x27;s error-theory and non-cognitivism (including S. Blackburn&#x27;s quasi-realism) in view of both everyday and sophisticated moral speech and argument. The same point is often expressed as the Frege-Geach Objection. Skorupski distinguishes between receptive awareness, which is not possible in normative matters, and non-receptive awareness (including dialogical knowledge), which is possible in normative matters.

Hilary Putnam&#x27;s book &quot;Ethics without Ontology&quot; (Harvard, 2004) argues for a similar view, that ethical (and for that matter mathematical) sentences can be true and objective without there being any objects to make them so.

Cognitivism points to the semantic difference between imperative sentences and declarative sentences in normative subjects. Or to the different meanings and purposes of some superficially declarative sentences. For instance, if a teacher allows one of her students to go out by saying &quot;You may go out&quot;, this sentence is neither true nor false. It &quot;gives&quot; a permission. But, in most situations, if one of the students asks one of his classmates whether she thinks that he may go out and she answers &quot;Of course you may go out&quot;, this sentence is either true or false. It does not &quot;give&quot; a permission, it states that &quot;there is&quot; a permission.

Another argument for ethical cognitivism stands on the close resemblance between ethics and other normative matters, such as games. As much as morality, games consist of norms (or s), but it would be hard to accept that it be not true that the chessplayer who checkmates the other one wins the game. If statements about game rules can be true or false, why not ethical statements? One answer is that we may want ethical statements to be categorically true, while we only need statements about right action to be contingent on the acceptance of the rules of a particular game—that is, the choice to play the game according to a given set of rules.

<doc id="313565" wikidata="Q23382" url="?curid=313565" title="Cognitivism (psychology)">
<text>In psychology, cognitivism is a theoretical framework for understanding the mind that gained credence in the 1950s. The movement was a response to behaviorism, which cognitivists said neglected to explain cognition. Cognitive psychology derived its name from the Latin &quot;cognoscere&quot;, referring to knowing and information, thus cognitive psychology is an information-processing psychology derived in part from earlier traditions of the investigation of thought and problem solving.

Behaviorists acknowledged the existence of thinking but identified it as a behavior. Cognitivists argued that the way people think impacts their behavior and therefore cannot be a behavior in and of itself. Cognitivists later claimed that thinking is so essential to psychology that the study of thinking should become its own field. However, cognitivists typically presuppose a specific form of mental activity, of the kind advanced by computationalism.

Cognitivism has more recently been challenged by postcognitivism.

== Cognitive development ==

The process of assimilating and expanding our intellectual horizon is termed as cognitive development. We have a complex physiological structure that absorbs a variety of stimuli from the environment, stimuli being the interactions that are able to produce knowledge and skills. Parents process knowledge informally in the home while teachers process knowledge formally in school. Knowledge should be pursued with zest and zeal; if not, then learning becomes a burden.

== Attention ==

Attention is the first part of cognitive development. It pertains to a person&#x27;s ability to focus and sustain concentration. Attention can also be how focus minded an individual is and having their full concentration on one thing. It is differentiated from other temperamental characteristics like persistence and distractibility in the sense that the latter modulates an individual&#x27;s daily interaction with the environment. Attention, on the other hand, involves his behavior when performing specific tasks. Learning, for instance, takes place when the student gives attention towards the teacher. Interest and effort closely relate to attention. Attention is an active process which involves numerous outside stimuli. The attention of an organism at any point in time involves three concentric circles; beyond awareness, margin, and focus. Individuals have a mental capacity; there are only so many things someone can focus on at one time.

A theory of cognitive development called information processing holds that memory and attention are the foundation of cognition. It is suggested that children&#x27;s attention is initially selective and is based on situations that are important to their goals. This capacity increases as the child grows older since they are more able to absorb stimuli from tasks. Another conceptualization classified attention into mental attention and perceptual attention. The former is described as the executive-driven attentional &quot;brain energy&quot; that activates task-relevant processes in the brain while the latter are immediate or spontaneous attention driven by novel perceptual experiences.

== Process of learning ==

Cognitive theory mainly stresses the acquisition of knowledge and growth of the mental structure. Cognitive theory tends to focus on conceptualizing the student&#x27;s learning process: how information is received; how information is processed and organized into existing schema; how information is retrieved upon recall. In other words, cognitive theory seeks to explain the process of knowledge acquisition and the subsequent effects on the mental structures within the mind. Learning is not about the mechanics of what a learner does, but rather a process depending on what the learner already knows (existing information) and their method of acquiring new knowledge (how they integrate new information into their existing schemas). Knowledge acquisition is an activity consisting of internal codification of mental structures within the student&#x27;s mind. Inherent to the theory, the student must be an active participant in their own learning process. Cognitive approaches mainly focus on the mental activities of the learner like mental planning, goal setting, and organizational strategies.
In cognitive theories not only the environmental factors and instructional components play an important role in learning. There are additional key elements like learning to code, transform, rehearse, and store and retrieve the information. The learning process includes learner&#x27;s thoughts, beliefs, and attitude values.

== Role of memory ==

Memory plays a vital role in the learning process. Information is stored within memory in an organised, meaningful manner. Here, teacher and designers play different roles in the learning process. Teachers supposedly facilitate learning and the organization of information in an optimal way. Whereas designers supposedly use advanced techniques (such as analogies, mnemonic devices, and hierarchical relationships) to help learners acquire new information to add to their prior knowledge. Forgetting is described as an inability to retrieve information from memory. Memory loss may be a mechanism used to discard situationally irrelevant information by assessing the relevance of newly acquired information.

== Process of transfer ==

According to cognitive theory, if a learner knows how to implement knowledge in different contexts and conditions, then we can say that transfer has occurred. Understanding is composed of knowledge - in the form of rules, concepts and discrimination. Knowledge stored in memory is important, but the use of such knowledge is also important. Prior knowledge will be used for identifying similarities and differences between itself and novel information.

== Types of learning explained in detail by this position ==

Cognitive theory mostly explains complex forms of learning in terms of reasoning, problem solving and information processing. Emphasis must be placed on the fact that the goal of all aforementioned viewpoints is considered to be the same - the transfer of knowledge to the student in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Simplification and standardization are two techniques used to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer. Knowledge can be analysed, decomposed and simplified into basic building blocks. There is a correlation with the behaviorist model of the knowledge transfer environment. Cognitivists stress the importance of efficient processing strategies.

== Basic principles of the cognitive theory and relevance to instructional design ==

A behaviorist uses feedback (reinforcement) to change the behavior in the desired direction, while the cognitivist uses the feedback for guiding and supporting the accurate mental connections.
For different reasons learners&#x27; task analyzers are critical to both cognitivists and behaviorists. Cognitivists look at the learner&#x27;s predisposition to learning (How does the learner activate, maintain, and direct their learning?). Additionally, cognitivists examine the learners&#x27; &#x27;how to design&#x27; instruction that it can be assimilated. (i.e., what about the learner&#x27;s existing mental structures?) In contrast, the behaviorists look to determine where the lesson should begin (i.e., at what level the learners are performing successfully?) and what are the most effective reinforcements (i.e., What are the consequences that are most desired by the learner?).

There are some specific assumptions or principles that direct the instructional design: active involvement of the learner in the learning process, learner control, metacognitive training (e.g., self-planning, monitoring, and revising techniques), the use of hierarchical analyses to identify and illustrate prerequisite relationships (cognitive task analysis procedure), facilitating optimal processing of structuring, organizing and sequencing information (use of cognitive strategies such as outlining, summaries, synthesizers, advance organizers etc.), encouraging the students to make connections with previously learned material, and creating learning environments (recall of prerequisite skills; use of relevant examples, analogies).

== Structuring instruction ==

Cognitive theories emphasize mainly on making knowledge meaningful and helping learners to organize and relate new information to existing knowledge in memory. Instruction should be based on students&#x27; existing schema or mental structures, to be effective. The organisation of information is connected in such a manner that it should relate to the existing knowledge in some meaningful way. Examples of cognitive strategies include the use of analogies and metaphors, framing, outlining the mnemonics, concept mapping, advance organizers, and so forth. The cognitive theory mainly emphasizes the major tasks of the teacher / designer and includes analyzing various learning experiences to the learning situation, which can impact learning outcomes of different individuals.
Organizing and structuring the new information to connect the learners&#x27; previously acquired knowledge abilities and experiences.
The new information is effectively and efficiently assimilated/accommodated within the learners cognitive structure.

==Theoretical approach==

Cognitivism has two major components, one methodological, the other theoretical. Methodologically, cognitivism has a positivist approach and says that psychology can be (in principle) fully explained by the use of the scientific method, there is speculation on whether or not this is true. This is also largely a reductionist goal, with the belief that individual components of mental function (the &#x27;cognitive architecture&#x27;) can be identified and meaningfully understood. The second says that cognition contains discrete and internal mental states (representations or symbols) that can be changed using rules or algorithms.

Cognitivism became the dominant force in psychology in the late-20th century, replacing behaviorism as the most popular paradigm for understanding mental function. Cognitive psychology is not a wholesale refutation of behaviorism, but rather an expansion that accepts that mental states exist. This was due to the increasing criticism towards the end of the 1950s of simplistic learning models. One of the most notable criticisms was Noam Chomsky&#x27;s argument that language could not be acquired purely through conditioning, and must be at least partly explained by the existence of internal mental states.

The main issues that interest cognitive psychologists are the inner mechanisms of human thought and the processes of knowing. Cognitive psychologists have attempted to shed some light on the alleged mental structures that stand in a causal relationship to our physical actions.

==Criticisms of psychological cognitivism==

In the 1990s, various new theories emerged that challenged cognitivism and the idea that thought was best described as computation. Some of these new approaches, often influenced by phenomenological and postmodern philosophy, include situated cognition, distributed cognition, dynamicism and embodied cognition. Some thinkers working in the field of artificial life (for example Rodney Brooks) have also produced non-cognitivist models of cognition. On the other hand, much of early cognitive psychology, and the work of many currently active cognitive psychologists, does not treat cognitive processes as computational.
The idea that mental functions can be described as information processing models has been criticised by philosopher John Searle and mathematician Roger Penrose who both argue that computation has some inherent shortcomings which cannot capture the fundamentals of mental processes.
* Penrose uses Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem (which states that there are mathematical truths which can never be proven in a sufficiently strong mathematical system; any sufficiently strong system of axioms will also be incomplete) and Turing&#x27;s halting problem (which states that there are some things which are inherently non-computable) as evidence for his position.
* Searle has developed two arguments, the first (well known through his Chinese room thought experiment) is the &#x27;syntax is not semantics&#x27; argument—that a program is just syntax, while understanding requires semantics; therefore programs (hence cognitivism) cannot explain understanding. Such an argument presupposes the controversial notion of a private language. The second, which Searle now prefers but is less well known, is his &#x27;syntax is not physics&#x27; argument—nothing in the world is intrinsically a computer program except as applied, described, or interpreted by an observer, so either everything can be described as a computer and trivially a brain can but then this does not explain any specific mental processes, or there is nothing intrinsic in a brain that makes it a computer (program). Many oppose these views and have criticized his arguments, which have created significant disagreement. Both points, Searle claims, refute cognitivism.

Another argument against cognitivism is the problems of Ryle&#x27;s Regress or the homunculus fallacy. Cognitivists have offered a number of arguments attempting to refute these attacks.

<text>SMART, Scandinavian Multi Access Reservations for Travel Agents, is a computerized system for ticket reservation.

==History==
It was created in 1979 by SAS, Braathens and Swedish State Railways. Many travel companies had computerized their systems at the time, and provided terminal interfaces for travel agencies. Each had their own system, often involving widely different codes and procedures. It was cumbersome and expensive for a travel agency to have multiple terminals, each one connected to a different provider. SMART solved this, by providing a single interface over the public data network Datex.

It worked by having a Host Interface Processor (HIP) at each travel company. These would emulate a number of terminals, translate the messages, codes and addresses, wrap them in SMARTs own communications protocol, and provide the interface over Datex to the various travel agencies. There was, of course, functionality to limit access.

On the travel agency side, there would be SMART Terminal Equipment (STE) with the reverse function, emulating a server and providing interfaces for terminals. Now however, a travel agent could easily switch between screens for the different companies. The interfaces were similar to those for direct connections, but provided some standardization for codes to ease the transition between the systems.

The STE would also allow printing of documents, tickets, bills and similar, as well as interfacing with the accounting system.

The third component in the SMART system was the SMART Control Centre (SCC). It constantly monitored the status of all STEs and reported suspected errors in the STE hardware or communication lines. Furthermore, it could remotely configure the STEs, download application software and/or operating system, and reboot the computers - all automatically without any intervention.

All three SMART system components were delivered by Philips Data Systems. The HIP processors were Philips PTS 6813 and 6824 minicomputers, the STE travel agent front-office computers were Philips PTS 6911 workstation controllers and the SCC consisted of a Philips PTS 6813 minicomputer.

SMART could utilize some of Datex extra features like queuing and group numbers, and a logical connection (session) was not dependent on the physical connection (which could go up and down for instance during idle times to save money). Parallel sessions could be held with different or the same provider.

SMART spawned off into a company centered in Stockholm in 1984, SMART AB, with the subsidiaries SMART Sverige AB, SMART Danmark A/S, and SMART Norge AS (in Sweden, Denmark and Norway respectively).

SMART is still in use, though not over Datex. It has been widely replaced by Amadeus, by the same company. In 2003, SMART AB changed its name to Amadeus Scandinavia.

<text>Bat Yam ( ) is a city located on Israel&#x27;s Mediterranean Sea coast, on the Central Coastal Plain just south of Tel Aviv. It is part of the Gush Dan metropolitan area and the Tel Aviv District. In , it had a population of .

==History==
===British Mandate ===
Bat Yam, originally Bayit VeGan (&quot;House and Garden&quot;), was founded in 1919 by the Bayit VeGan homeowners association, affiliated with the Mizrachi movement. The association was formed to establish a religious garden suburb in Jaffa. By March 1920, it had 400 members. In 1921, of land were purchased, of which 1,400 were formally registered by 1923. In September 1924, an urban blueprint was approved by the association. In early 1926, the plots were divided up and a lottery was held to determine who would build first. By October 1926, roads and water supply were complete. Six families settled on the land in cabins. According to a report in 1927, ten houses were under construction. A synagogue was dedicated in October 1928. By then there were 13 families living in Bat Yam and a total of 20 houses.
In the wake of the 1929 Arab riots, the residents were evacuated by the British army and their homes were turned into barracks. The soldiers left at the end of 1931. In 1932, the residents began to return and were joined by others. In November 1933, 85 families were living in the neighborhood. By early 1936, there were 300 homes and a population of 1400. Local industry began to develop, a movie theatre opened and a hotel was established. The first school, named after Tachkemoni, was founded in 1936. The first headmaster was Haim Baruch Friedman.

In December 1936, Bayit VeGan was declared a local council. It encompassed 3,500 dunams, 370 dunams of which were Arab-owned. In December 1937, the name was formally changed to Bat Yam (literally &quot;daughter of the sea&quot;). By 1945, 2,000 Jews were living in Bat Yam. In 1936–1939, the town was cut off from Tel Aviv because the road ran through Jaffa, leading to the construction of a new road via Holon. According to the Jewish National Fund, the population had risen to 4,000 by 1947.

Following the vote in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine on November 29, 1947, and the fighting that accompanied the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, violent incidents, including sniping, were reported by the residents of Bat Yam.

===State of Israel===
After the establishment of the state in 1948, Bat Yam grew dramatically due to mass immigration. It gained city status in 1958.

==Demography==
A small Hasidic enclave of Bobover Hasidim, known as Kiryat Bobov, was established in 1958.

The vast majority of Israelis of Vietnamese origin live in Bat Yam.

Since the wave of immigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union began in the 1970s, Bat Yam became an area where many Russian speakers became settled and continue to live to this day.

== Main neighborhoods ==
=== Ramat Yosef ===
Named after Yosef Sprinzak, and is one of the oldest in Bat Yam, with most of its houses built in the fifties and sixties.

=== Shikkun Amidar ===
A religious-traditional neighborhood. In the northwest part of the neighborhood, the Defenders&#x27; Square is located, being the main commercial center of the neighborhood and of the entire city.

=== Kiryat Bobov ===
An ultra-orthodox-Chassidic neighborhood of the Bobover Hasidism, led by Rabbi Meizlish, brother-in-law of the Rebbe of Bobov. In the neighborhood there is a synagogue, a Talmud Torah, a small yeshiva, a large yeshiva - all in one building; as well as the largest Mikveh in Bat Yam..

=== Orot HaTorah ===
Mainly home to - a religious Zionist community led by Rabbi David Chai HaCohen, among the institutions of the Orot HaTorah Congregation in the neighborhood: the synagogue, the high yeshiva &quot;Yishiva Nativot Yisrael&quot; and Talmud Torah Orot HaTorah.

=== Chabad ===
Home to the Chabad Community - the community has five synagogues, a central Chabad house, a boys&#x27; kindergarten, a girls&#x27; kindergarten, Talmud Torah, a seminary for women and girls and a Mikveh.

== Main sites ==
=== The Defenders&#x27; Square ===
A monument in the memory of the defenders of the city who fell in battle. Located at the entrance to Bat Yam from Tel Aviv. In the War of Independence, there was a defense post in this place called &quot;Hashdera&quot; or &quot;King George&#x27;s Position&quot; (the previous name of the Independence Boulevard).

=== HaSela (the Rock) Beach ===
A popular beach, surrounded by a breakwater, suitable for all ages. The beach is very active and sports activities are held there in the early morning hours. In the summer season there are summer events such as street stalls, clowns and shows.

=== Bat Yam Heritage Museum ===
The museum is located in the municipal library building. The museum has photographs, documents and various exhibits on the history of Bat Yam in the years 1926–1948, including a detailed description of the city&#x27;s standing in the War of Independence.

=== Bat Yam City Hall ===
 was designed by the architects Zvi Hecker, and Alfred Neumann. When it was built between 1960 and 1963, the building stood alone in the heart of the dunes and was exposed to the coastline of Bat-Yam. The building was designed in the form of an inverted pyramid, in Brutalist architecture style.

== Local government ==

In the early 2000s, after financial scandals under the leadership of Yehoshua Sagi, the city was on the brink of bankruptcy. In 2003, he was replaced by Shlomo Lahiani, founder of the 
Bat Yam Berosh Muram (Bat Yam Heads-Up) party. In 2008, he was re-elected with 86% of the vote. In 2014, Lahiani pleaded guilty to three counts of breach of public trust after being charged with bribery and income tax fraud.
He was replaced by Yossi Bachar.

In 2014, after the Bat Yam municipality petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court, Interior Minister Gideon Saar appointed a steering committee to explore the possibility of incorporating the city as part of Tel Aviv-Yafo as a way of reviving its stagnant economy. Later that year, when Gideon Sa’ar was replaced by Gilad Erdan, a decision was reached to transfer funding to Bat Yam directly from the state budget. The plan for unification was postponed until the next municipal elections in 2023. In 2019, Bat Yam&#x27;s current mayor, Tzvika Brot, said he opposed the union with Tel Aviv.

==Council heads and mayors==

==Urban development==

In 2016, the municipality approved an urban renewal plan in the Ramat Hanasi neighborhood, adding 950 high-end apartments.

According to Bat Yam mayor Tzvika Brot, the city is looking for creative solutions to rebuild the city and preserve its economic independence. The city has six beaches and a 3.2 kilometer (2 mile) long promenade along the Mediterranean coast that connects to the Tel Aviv boardwalk.

According to a report in Ynet, Bat Yam has become a countrywide leader in urban renewal. Many of the city&#x27;s older buildings are undergoing construction to strengthen their foundations, add floors and improve their appearance, and dozens of parks are being beautified and made accessible to visitors with disabilities.

According to Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, residents of Bat Yam have the lowest income among the largest cities in Israel.

==Health care==
The Yehuda Abarbanel Mental Health Center is a psychiatric hospital founded in 1944 by the British Mandate authorities. Since the establishment of the state, it had been administered by the Israeli Ministry of Health. The hospital, named for Judah Abravanel, a Portuguese rabbi, Jewish philosopher and physician in the Middle Ages, provides hospitalization and ambulatory services to residents of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, Holon and Bat Yam coping with mental illness.

==Education==

In 2008, the Weitzman-Albert Education Initiative headed by Jane Gershon, wife of fashion shoe designer Stuart Weitzman invested over $2 million in Bat Yam&#x27;s Harel Elementary School, which received a top Education Ministry award for academic achievement and immigrant integration.

In 2017, the percentage of high school students eligible for a bagrut matriculation certificate reached 86.3%, compared to the 68.2% national average. The number of high school students doing a five-point exam in mathematics is also on the rise thanks to a program inaugurated in 2015 in cooperation with the Donald J. Trump Foundation and Alliance Israélite Universelle to encourage excellence in math.

==Culture==

In the heart of Bat Yam is a three-museum complex known as MoBY. The main building, David Ben-Ari Museum for Contemporary art was established in 1961. The Rybak House and the Sholem Asch Museum house MoBY&#x27;s permanent collections and offer educational programs. The Bat Yam Heritage Museum is adjacent to the municipal library,

The Bat Yam amphitheatre, also built in the 1960s near the beach, is a venue for concerts and public events. The International Street Theater Festival, the largest open-space performance art celebration in Israel, is an annual summer event in Bat Yam.

The Ryback House showcases the work of Issachar Ber Ryback. The Yiddish writer Sholom Asch, who lived in Bat Yam in his later years, willed his home to the Bat Yam municipality, which turned it into museum.

In 2008 the Bat-Yam International Biennale of Landscape Urbanism, which is devoted to re-examining urban spaces through art and architecture, was held in Bat Yam. In 2010, the second Biennale, &quot;Timing&quot; took place, which featured site-specific installations from designers and architects from around the world.

The Center for Urbanism and Mediterranean Culture is a research institute devoted to the creation of a new discourse in Israeli urban space. The head of the center is veteran Haaretz correspondent Avirama Golan.

The city has two shopping malls, Kanyon Bat Yam, which opened in 1993, and Kanyon Bat Yamon.

==Archaeology==
In September 2011, an iron anchor dating to the Byzantine period was discovered off the coast of Bat Yam. According to the Israel Antiquities Authority, it was likely that of a boat that sank in a storm about 1,700 years ago and may be proof of an unknown ancient harbor on the coast.

==Architecture==
Bat Yam&#x27;s old city hall, designed by Israeli architect Zvi Hecker in the 1960s, is a modernist building of reinforced concrete in the shape of an inverted ziggurat. The design was chosen in a competition in 1959 which drew entries from the leading architectural firms in Israel.

==Beaches==
The location of Bat Yam on the Mediterranean makes it popular with beach-goers. Bat Yam has a long promenade along the ocean lined with pubs and restaurants. The city has six beaches, one of which is protected by a breakwater.

Bat Yam&#x27;s Al Gal beach is a popular surfing spot with fairly consistent surf conditions, especially during the summer months. Both Al Gal and Hagolshim are straight, exposed dune-backed beaches.

==Transportation==

Two railway stations opened in the city in 2011 as part of the new Tel Aviv – Rishon LeZion West line: Bat Yam-Yoseftal railway station and Bat Yam-Komemiyut railway station.
Bat Yam is served by the Red Line of the Tel Aviv Light Rail since August 18, 2023, and is planned to be served by the Metro line M3. The city will be the terminus for both lines and the lines will meet at the new Yoseftal Station.

The city will be served by the Ayalon Route of the Ofnidan bike path network.

The city&#x27;s major football (soccer) club, Beitar Tel Aviv Bat Yam, currently plays in Liga Leumit, the second level of Israeli football.

<text>The gnomefishes form a small family, Scombropidae, consisting of three extant species of marine ray-finned fish in the genus Scombrops. They have two dorsal fins and are notable for scales covering the soft parts of the dorsal and anal fins. The eyes are large. The gnomefish, &quot;S. boops&quot;, lives in deep rocky areas, down to 400 m. It can grow to 150 cm total length and 16 kg weight.

&quot;S. gilberti&quot; occurs in the western Pacific including Japan. The Atlantic scombrops, &quot;S. oculatus&quot;, is widely found in the subtropical western Atlantic, particularly the Florida and Bahamas area. It is a deepwater fish, caught by anglers between 200 and 610 m.

==Species==
The following species are classified within the genus &quot;Scombrops&quot;:

* &quot;Scombrops boops&quot; 
* &quot;Scombrops gilberti&quot; 
* &quot;Scombrops oculatus&quot; 

The Scombropidae have been put forward as the sister taxon to the Pempheridae by some authorities.

<text>Remo Giazotto (4 September 1910, Rome – 26 August 1998, Pisa) was an Italian musicologist, music critic, and composer, mostly known through his systematic catalogue of the works of Tomaso Albinoni. He wrote biographies of Albinoni and other composers, including Antonio Vivaldi.

Giazotto served as a music critic (from 1932) and editor (1945–1949) of the &quot;Rivista musicale italiana&quot; and was appointed co-editor of the &quot;Nuova rivista musicale italiana&quot; in 1967. He was a professor of the history of music at the University of Florence (1957–69) and in 1962 was nominated to the Accademia Nazionale di S. Cecilia.

In 1949, Giazotto became the director of the chamber music programs for Italian state broadcaster RAI and in 1966 was appointed director of its international programs organized through the European Broadcasting Union. He was also the president of RAI&#x27;s auditioning committee and editor of its series of biographies on composers.

Giazotto was the father of physicist Adalberto Giazotto.

== Adagio in G minor ==

Giazotto is famous for his publication of a work called &quot;Adagio in G minor&quot;, which he claimed to have elaborated from a fragment of an Albinoni trio sonata that he had received from the Saxon State Library. According to Giazotto, it contained the bass line in print and six bars from the first violin part in manuscript. However, the fragment has never appeared in public, and the work was copyrighted by Giazotto.

A major complaint was that Bezeq did not send customers itemized bills. 46 cases were brought to small claims court and the consumers won 43 of them. Within two years of the campaign. consumers began to receive itemized bills.

In April 2012, Bezeq acquired full ownership of Walla! Communications, Israel&#x27;s leading Internet portal, which has more than 2.5 million monthly unique users. In December 2020, Bezeq sold its 100% stake in Walla! Communications.

Bezeq operates the B144 directory enquiries service.

In February 2015, Bezeq acquired full ownership of Yes, Israel&#x27;s leading television provider, for ₪680 million.

===Loss of monopoly status===

Until the mid-first decade of the 21st century when it was owned by the Israeli government, Bezeq had a monopoly on landline telephony and Internet access infrastructure (ADSL VDSL2). Though still the most dominant provider of telephone services, it has had competition from the sole cable provider in the country (since September 2006), Hot, which offers a cables based telephone and internet access services as of 2005, and with 012 Smile and more recently 013 netvision and Orange.

===Privatization===
On 9 May 2005, Israel&#x27;s Government Companies Authority, headed by Eyal Gabbai privatized Bezeq when 30% of its shares were sold by the state to the Apax-Saban-Arkin investment group for $972 million.
In April 2010, the controlling interest in Bezeq, held by the Apax-Saban-Arkin group, was sold to B Communications, a subsidiary of Shaul Elovitch&#x27;s Eurocom Group, for $1.75 billion.

In late 2017, bank filed a petition against Elovitch to break up Eurocom Group to pay back loans totaling $275 million. This would directly impact the 10% shareholding in Bezeq, including Elovitch&#x27;s 26% controlling stake. Meir Shamir has expressed interest in buying a controlling stake, effectively cancelling the debt to the banks. Two other investors have also expressed interest in purchasing a stake in Bezeq, including Argentine investor Eduardo Elsztain and Elliott Management, who announced they had recently purchased a 4,8% stake.

===Police investigation and graft probe===

In 2018 the company announced that company CEO Stella Handler would be resigning her position. She is one of several Bezeq employees under investigation by the Israel Securities Authority and the Israel Police regarding Bezeq&#x27;s purchase of Yes shares and allegations of improper dealings with the Israeli Ministry of Communication. Also in 2018, board members Shaul Elovitch, Or Elovitch and Orna Elovitch resigned as a result of Case 4000, an ongoing corruption investigation involving the former Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu.

===Involvement in Israeli settlements===

In October 2017, Danish pension firm Sampension banned investment in Bezeq alongside three other companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including two Israeli banks, Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, and German firm Heidelberg Cement.

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of 112 companies helping to further Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. These settlements are considered illegal under international law. Bezeq was listed on the database on account of its &quot;provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of settlements&quot; and &quot;the use of natural resources, in particular water and land, for business
purposes&quot; in these occupied territories.

On 5 July 2021, Norway&#x27;s largest pension fund KLP said it would divest from Bezeq together with 15 other business entities implicated in the UN report for their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

===Parent company===
B Communications, founded in 1999 as 012 Smile.Communications, is a publicly traded company. It currently functions as a holding company of Bezeq and is headquartered in Ramat Gan, Israel. Its shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. B Communications is controlled by Searchlight II BZQ L.P (60%) and TNR investments Ltd (11%).

<doc id="313591" wikidata="Q369682" url="?curid=313591" title="Spermaceti">
<text>Spermaceti is a waxy substance found in the head cavities of the sperm whale (and, in smaller quantities, in the oils of other whales). Spermaceti is created in the spermaceti organ inside the whale&#x27;s head. This organ may contain as much as of spermaceti. It has been extracted by whalers since the 17th century for human use in cosmetics, textiles, and candles. 

Theories for the spermaceti organ&#x27;s biological function suggest that it may control buoyancy, act as a focusing apparatus for the whale&#x27;s sense of echolocation, or possibly both. Concrete evidence supports both theories. The buoyancy theory holds that the sperm whale is capable of heating the spermaceti, lowering its density and thus allowing the whale to float; for the whale to sink again, it must take water into its blowhole, which cools the spermaceti into a denser solid. This claim has been called into question by recent research that indicates a lack of biological structures to support this heat exchange, and the fact that the change in density is too small to be meaningful until the organ grows to a huge size. Measurement of the proportion of wax esters retained by a harvested sperm whale accurately described the age and future life expectancy of a given individual. The level of wax esters in the spermaceti organ increases with the age of the whale: 38–51% in calves, 58–87% in adult females, and 71–94% in adult males.

Spermaceti wax is extracted from sperm oil by crystallisation at , when treated by pressure and a chemical solution of caustic alkali. Spermaceti forms brilliant white crystals that are hard but oily to the touch, and are devoid of taste or smell, making it very useful as an ingredient in cosmetics, leatherworking, and lubricants. The substance was also used in making candles of a standard photometric value, in the dressing of fabrics, and as a pharmaceutical excipient, especially in cerates and ointments.

The whaling industry in the 17th and 18th centuries was developed to find, harvest, and refine the contents of the head of a sperm whale. The crews seeking spermaceti routinely left on three-year tours on several oceans. Cetaceous lamp oil was a commodity that created many maritime fortunes. Candlepower, a photometric unit defined in the United Kingdom Act of Parliament Metropolitan Gas Act 1860 and adopted at the International Electrotechnical Conference of 1883, was based on the light produced by a single, pure spermaceti candle.

==Etymology==
Spermaceti is derived from Medieval Latin &quot;sperma ceti&quot;, meaning &quot;whale sperm&quot; (from Latin &quot;sperma&quot; meaning &quot;semen&quot; or &quot;seed&quot;, and &quot;ceti&quot;, the genitive form of &quot;whale&quot;). The substance was initially believed to be whale semen, due to its appearance when fresh. The substance is also the origin of the name of the sperm whale.

==Properties==
Raw spermaceti is liquid within the head of the sperm whale, and is said to have a smell similar to raw milk. It is composed mostly of wax esters (chiefly cetyl palmitate) and a smaller proportion of triglycerides. Unlike other toothed whales, most of the carbon chains in the wax esters are relatively long (). The blubber oil of the whale is about 66% wax. When it cools to 30 °C or below, the waxes begin to solidify. The speed of sound in spermaceti is 2,684 m/s (at 40 kHz, 36 °C), making it nearly twice as good a conductor of sounds as the oil in a dolphin&#x27;s melon.

Spermaceti is insoluble in water, very slightly soluble in cold ethanol, but easily dissolved in ether, chloroform, carbon disulfide, and boiling ethanol. Spermaceti consists principally of cetyl palmitate (the ester of cetyl alcohol and palmitic acid), . Simple triglycerides are seen as well.

A botanical alternative to spermaceti is a derivative of jojoba oil, jojoba esters, , a solid wax, which is chemically and physically very similar to spermaceti and may be used in many of the same applications.

==Biological function==
Currently, disagreement exists on what biological purpose or purposes spermaceti serves. The proportion of wax esters retained by an average (living) whale head appears to reflect buoyancy influenced by heat. Changes in density likely enhance echolocation. It might be used as a means of adjusting the whale&#x27;s buoyancy, since the density of the spermaceti changes with its phase. Another hypothesis has been that it is used as a cushion to protect the sperm whale&#x27;s delicate snout while diving.

The most likely primary function of the spermaceti organ is to add internal echo or resonator clicks to the sonar echolocation clicks emitted by the respiratory organs. This makes possible the whale sensing the motion of its prey and its position. The changing distance to the prey affects the time interval between the returning clicks reflected by the prey. This would explain the low density and high compressibility of the spermaceti, which enhance the resonance by the contrast of the acoustic properties of the sea water and of the hard tissue surrounding the spermaceti.

==Spermaceti processing==

After killing a sperm whale, the whalers would pull the carcass alongside the ship, cut off the head and pull it on deck. Then, they would cut a hole in it and bail out the matter inside with a bucket. The harvested matter, raw spermaceti, was stored in casks to be processed back on land. A large whale could yield as much as . The spermaceti was boiled and strained of impurities to prevent it from going rancid. On land, the casks were allowed to chill during the winter, causing the spermaceti to congeal into a spongy and viscous mass. The congealed matter was then loaded into wool sacks and placed in a press to squeeze out the liquid. This liquid was bottled and sold as &quot;winter-strained sperm oil&quot;. This was the most valuable product - an oil that remained liquid in freezing winter temperatures.

Later, during the warmer seasons, the leftover solid was allowed to partially melt, and the liquid was strained off to leave a fully solid wax. This wax, brown in color, was then bleached and sold as &quot;spermaceti wax&quot;. Spermaceti wax is white and translucent. It melts at about and congeals at .

<doc id="313592" wikidata="Q179458" url="?curid=313592" title="Charles Albert Gobat">
<text>Charles Albert Gobat (; 21 May 1843 – 16 March 1914) was a Swiss lawyer, educational administrator, and politician who jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize with Élie Ducommun in 1902 for their leadership of the Permanent International Peace Bureau.

==Birth and education==
Gobat was born on 21 May 1843 at Tramelan, Switzerland. He was the son of a Protestant pastor and the nephew of Samuel Gobat, a missionary who became bishop of Jerusalem. He was educated at the University of Basel, University of Heidelberg, University of Bern, and University of Paris. He received his doctorate in law, summa cum laude, from the University of Heidelberg in 1867.

==Career in law and politics==
After completing his Ph.D., Gobat began his practicing law in Bern and also lectured on French civil law at Bern University. He then opened an office in Delémont in the canton of Bern, which soon became the leading legal firm of the district.

After practicing law for fifteen years, he became involved in politics and education. In 1882, he was appointed superintendent of public instruction for the canton of Bern, a position he held for thirty years. He was a progressive in educational philosophy and he made many important reforms in the education system. He reformed the system of primary training, obtained increased budgetary support to improve the teacher-pupil ratio, supported the study of living languages, and provided pupils with an alternative to the traditionally narrow classical education by establishing curricula in vocational and professional training.

He won acclaim for his erudite &quot;République de Berne et la France pendant les guerres de religion&quot;, which was published in 1891 and also widespread recognition for &quot;A People&#x27;s History of Switzerland&quot;, which was published in 1900.

He also pursued a career in politics. He was elected to the Grand Council of Bern in 1882. From 1884 to 1890, he was a member of the Council of States of Switzerland and from 1890 until his death in 1914, he was a member of the National Council, the other chamber of the central Swiss legislative body. In both politics and education, he was a liberal reformer. In 1902, he sponsored several legislation that applied the principle of arbitration to commercial treaties.
Gobat worked with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which was founded by William Randal Cremer, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1903, in 1889. In 1892, he became the president of the union&#x27;s fourth conference, which was held in Bern and founded the Bureau Interparlementaire. He served as general secretary of the bureau, an information office dealing with peace movements, international conciliation, and communication among national parliamentary bodies. The third conference of the union, held in Rome in 1891, established the International Peace Bureau, of which Gobat was director when it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1910.

==Later years==
In 1902, Gobat jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1902 with Élie Ducommun for their leadership of the Permanent International Peace Bureau.

After the death of Élie Ducommun in 1906, Gobat took over the direction of the International Peace Bureau.

Gobat died on 16 March 1914 in Bern, Switzerland. While attending meeting of the peace conference at Bern, he arose as if to speak but collapsed, dying about an hour later.

<text>Princess Beatrice (Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore; 14 April 1857 – 26 October 1944), later Princess Henry of Battenberg, was the fifth daughter and youngest child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Beatrice was also the last of Queen Victoria&#x27;s children to die, nearly 66 years after the first, her elder sister Alice.

Beatrice&#x27;s childhood coincided with Queen Victoria&#x27;s grief following the death of her husband on 14 December 1861. As her elder sisters married and left their mother, the Queen came to rely on the company of her youngest daughter, whom she called &quot;Baby&quot; for most of her childhood. Beatrice was brought up to stay with her mother always and she soon resigned herself to her fate. The Queen was so set against her youngest daughter marrying that she refused to discuss the possibility. Nevertheless, many suitors were put forward, including Louis Napoléon, Prince Imperial, the son of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France, and Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, the widower of Beatrice&#x27;s older sister Alice. She was attracted to the Prince Imperial and there was talk of a possible marriage, but he was killed in the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879.

Beatrice fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg, the son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia von Hauke and brother-in-law of her niece Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. After a year of persuasion, the Queen, whose consent was required pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act, finally agreed to the marriage, which took place at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight on 23 July 1885. Queen Victoria consented on condition that Beatrice and Henry make their home with her and that Beatrice continue her duties as the Queen&#x27;s unofficial secretary. The Prince and Princess had four children, but 10 years into their marriage, on 20 January 1896, Prince Henry died of malaria while fighting in the Anglo-Asante War. Beatrice remained at her mother&#x27;s side until Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901. Beatrice devoted the next 30 years to editing Queen Victoria&#x27;s journals as her designated literary executor and continued to make public appearances. She died aged 87 in 1944.

==Early life==
Princess Beatrice was born on 14 April 1857 at Buckingham Palace, London. She was the fifth daughter and youngest of the nine children of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (later the Prince Consort). The birth caused controversy when it was announced that Queen Victoria would seek relief from the pains of delivery through the use of chloroform administered by Dr John Snow. Chloroform was considered dangerous to mother and child and was frowned upon by the Church of England and the medical authorities. Queen Victoria was undeterred and used &quot;that blessed chloroform&quot; for her last pregnancy. A fortnight later, Queen Victoria reported in her journal, &quot;I was amply rewarded and forgot all I had gone through when I heard dearest Albert say &#x27;It&#x27;s a fine child, and a girl!&#x27;&quot; Albert and Queen Victoria chose the names &quot;Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore&quot;: Mary after Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester, the last surviving child of King George III the United Kingdom; Victoria after the Queen; and Feodore after Feodora, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Queen&#x27;s older half-sister. She was baptised in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace on 16 June 1857. Her godparents were the Duchess of Kent (maternal grandmother); the Princess Royal (eldest sister); and the Prince Frederick of Prussia (her future brother-in-law).
From birth, Beatrice became a favoured child. The elder favourite daughter of Prince Albert, the Princess Royal, was about to take up residence in Germany with her new husband, Frederick (&quot;Fritz&quot;) of Prussia. At the same time, the newly arrived Beatrice showed promise. Albert wrote to Augusta, Fritz&#x27;s mother, that &quot;Baby practises her scales like a good &quot;prima donna&quot; before a performance and has a good voice!&quot; Although Queen Victoria was known to dislike most babies, she liked Beatrice, whom she considered attractive. This provided Beatrice with an advantage over her elder siblings. Queen Victoria once remarked that Beatrice was &quot;a pretty, plump and flourishing child ... with fine large blue eyes, [a] pretty little mouth and very fine skin&quot;. Her long, golden hair was the focus of paintings commissioned by Queen Victoria, who enjoyed giving Beatrice her bath, in marked contrast to her bathing preferences for her other children. Beatrice showed intelligence, which further endeared her to the Prince Consort, who was amused by her childhood precociousness.

He wrote to Baron Stockmar that Beatrice was &quot;the most amusing baby we have had.&quot; Despite sharing the rigorous education programme designed by Prince Albert and his close adviser, Baron Stockmar, Beatrice had a more relaxed infancy than her siblings because of her relationship with her parents. By four years of age, the youngest, and the acknowledged last royal child, Beatrice was not forced to share her parents&#x27; attention the way her siblings had, and her amusing ways provided comfort to her faltering father.

==Queen Victoria&#x27;s devoted companion==

In March 1861, Queen Victoria&#x27;s mother Victoria, Duchess of Kent, died at Frogmore. The Queen broke down in grief and guilt over their estrangement at the beginning of her reign. Beatrice tried to console her mother by reminding her that the Duchess of Kent was &quot;in heaven, but Beatrice hopes she will return&quot;. This comfort was significant because Queen Victoria had isolated herself from her children except the eldest unmarried daughter, Princess Alice, and Beatrice. Queen Victoria again relied on Beatrice and Alice after the death of Albert, of typhoid fever, on 14 December.

The depth of the Queen&#x27;s grief over the death of her husband surprised her family, courtiers, politicians and general populace. As when her mother died, she shut herself off from her family—most particularly, the Prince of Wales, (whom she blamed for her husband&#x27;s death), with the exception of Alice and Beatrice. Queen Victoria often took Beatrice from her cot, hurried to her bed and &quot;lay there sleepless, clasping to her child, wrapped in the nightclothes of a man who would wear them no more.&quot; After 1871, when the last of Beatrice&#x27;s elder sisters married, Queen Victoria came to rely upon her youngest daughter, who had declared from an early age: &quot;I don&#x27;t like weddings at all. I shall never be married. I shall stay with my mother.&quot; As her mother&#x27;s secretary, she performed duties such as writing on the Queen&#x27;s behalf and helping with political correspondence. These mundane duties mirrored those that had been performed in succession by her sisters, Alice, Helena and Louise. However, to these the Queen soon added more personal tasks. During a serious illness in 1871, the Queen dictated her journal entries to Beatrice, and in 1876 she allowed Beatrice to sort the music she and the Prince Consort had played, unused since his death fifteen years earlier.

The devotion that Beatrice showed to her mother was acknowledged in the Queen&#x27;s letters and journals, but her constant need for Beatrice grew stronger. The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown, died at Balmoral. Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support. Unlike her siblings, Beatrice had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other&#x27;s company; indeed, they had worked together to carry out the Queen&#x27;s wishes.

==Marriage==

===Possible suitors===
Although the Queen was set against Beatrice marrying anyone in the expectation that she would always stay at home with her, a number of possible suitors were put forward before Beatrice&#x27;s marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg. One of these was Napoléon Eugéne, the French Prince Imperial, son and heir of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France and his wife, Empress Eugénie. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870. After the Emperor&#x27;s death in 1873, Queen Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial. These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the Anglo-Zulu War on 1 June 1879. Queen Victoria&#x27;s journal records their grief: &quot;Dear Beatrice, crying very much as I did too, gave me the telegram ... It was dawning and little sleep did I get ... Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned.&quot;
After the death of the Prince Imperial, the Prince of Wales suggested that Beatrice marry their sister Alice&#x27;s widower, Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse. Alice had died in 1878, and the Prince argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis&#x27;s young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother. He further suggested the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her Hessian grandchildren with greater ease. However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister&#x27;s widower. This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the Houses of Parliament of the Deceased Wife&#x27;s Sister Bill, which would have removed the obstacle. Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the House of Commons, it was rejected by the House of Lords because of opposition from the Lords Spiritual. Although the Queen was disappointed that the bill had failed, she was happy to keep her daughter at her side.

Other candidates, including two of Prince Henry&#x27;s brothers, Prince Alexander (&quot;Sandro&quot;) and Prince Louis of Battenberg, were put forward to be Beatrice&#x27;s husband, but they did not succeed. Although Alexander never formally pursued Beatrice, merely claiming that he &quot;might even at one time have become engaged to the friend of my childhood, Beatrice of England&quot;, Louis was more interested. Queen Victoria invited him to dinner but sat between him and Beatrice, who had been told by the Queen to ignore Louis to discourage his suit. Louis, not realising for several years the reasons for this silence, married Beatrice&#x27;s niece, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Although her marriage hopes had been dealt another blow, while attending Louis&#x27;s wedding at Darmstadt, Beatrice fell in love with Prince Henry, who returned her affections.

===Engagement and wedding===
When Beatrice, after returning from Darmstadt, told her mother she planned to marry, the Queen reacted with frightening silence. Although they remained side by side, the Queen did not talk to her for seven months, instead communicating by note. Queen Victoria&#x27;s behaviour, unexpected even by her family, seemed prompted by the threatened loss of her daughter. The Queen regarded Beatrice as her &quot;Baby&quot; – her innocent child – and viewed the physical sex that would come with marriage as an end to innocence.

Subtle persuasions by the Princess of Wales and the Crown Princess of Prussia, who reminded her mother of the happiness that Beatrice had brought the Prince Consort, induced the Queen to resume talking to Beatrice. Queen Victoria consented to the marriage on condition that Henry give up his German commitments and live permanently with Beatrice and the Queen.

Beatrice and Henry were married at Saint Mildred&#x27;s Church at Whippingham, near Osborne, on 23 July 1885. Beatrice, who wore her mother&#x27;s wedding veil of Honiton lace, was escorted by the Queen and Beatrice&#x27;s eldest brother, the Prince of Wales. Princess Beatrice was attended by ten royal bridesmaids from among her nieces: Princesses Louise (18), Victoria and Maud of Wales; Princesses Irene and Alix of Hesse and by Rhine; Princesses Marie, Victoria Melita and Alexandra of Edinburgh; and Princesses Helena Victoria and Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein. The bridegroom&#x27;s supporters were his brothers, Prince Alexander of Bulgaria and Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg.

The ceremony – which was not attended by her eldest sister and brother-in-law, the Crown Prince and Princess of Prussia, who were detained in Germany; William Ewart Gladstone; or Beatrice&#x27;s cousin, Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck, who was in mourning for her father-in-law – ended with the couple&#x27;s departure for their honeymoon at Quarr Abbey House, a few miles from Osborne. The Queen, taking leave of them, &quot;bore up bravely till the departure and then fairly gave way&quot;, as she later admitted to the Crown Princess.

==Queen Victoria&#x27;s last years==
After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and her husband fulfilled their promise and returned to the Queen&#x27;s side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice&#x27;s love for Henry, like that of the Queen&#x27;s for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.

The addition of Prince Henry to the family gave new reasons for Beatrice and the Queen to look forward, and the court was brighter than it had been since the Prince Consort&#x27;s death. Even so, Henry, supported by Beatrice, was determined to take part in military campaigns, and this annoyed the Queen, who opposed his participation in life-threatening warfare. Conflicts also arose when Henry attended the Ajaccio carnival and kept &quot;low company&quot;, and Beatrice sent a Royal Navy officer to remove him from temptation. On one occasion, Henry slipped away to Corsica with his brother Louis; the Queen sent a warship to bring him back. Henry was feeling oppressed by the Queen&#x27;s constant need for his and his wife&#x27;s company.

Despite being married, Beatrice fulfilled her promise to the Queen by continuing as her full-time confidante and secretary. Queen Victoria warmed to Henry. However, the Queen criticised Beatrice&#x27;s conduct during her first pregnancy. When Beatrice stopped coming to the Queen&#x27;s dinners a week before giving birth, preferring to eat alone in her room, the Queen wrote angrily to her physician, Dr James Reid, that, &quot;I [urged the Princess to continue] coming to dinner, and not simply moping in her own room, which is very bad for her. In my case I regularly came to dinner, except when I was really unwell (even when suffering a great deal) up to the very last day.&quot; Beatrice, aided by chloroform, gave birth the following week to her first son, Alexander. Despite suffering a miscarriage in the early months of her marriage, Beatrice gave birth to four children: Alexander, called &quot;Drino&quot;, was born in 1886; Victoria Eugenie, called &quot;Ena&quot;, in 1887; Leopold in 1889; and Maurice in 1891. Following this, she took a polite and encouraging interest in social issues.

Although court entertainments were few after the Prince Consort&#x27;s death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often performed at the royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored by the lack of activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who was waiting for her husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry&#x27;s death two days earlier.

Devastated, she left court for a month of mourning before returning to her post at her mother&#x27;s side. The Queen&#x27;s journal reports that Queen Victoria &quot;[w]ent over to Beatrice&#x27;s room and sat a while with her. She is so piteous in her misery.&quot; Despite her grief, Beatrice remained her mother&#x27;s faithful companion, and as Queen Victoria aged, she relied more heavily on Beatrice for dealing with correspondence. However, realising that Beatrice needed a place of her own, she gave her the Kensington Palace apartments once occupied by the Queen and her mother. The Queen appointed Beatrice to the governorship of the Isle of Wight, vacated by Prince Henry&#x27;s death. In response to Beatrice&#x27;s interest in photography, the Queen had a darkroom installed at Osborne House. The changes in the family, including Beatrice&#x27;s preoccupation with her mother, may have affected her children, who rebelled at school. Beatrice wrote that Ena was &quot;troublesome and rebellious&quot;, and that Alexander was telling &quot;unwarrantable untruths&quot;.

==Later life==

Beatrice&#x27;s life was overturned by the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901. She wrote to the Principal of the University of Glasgow in March, &quot;... you may imagine what the grief is. I, who had hardly ever been separated from my dear mother, can hardly realise what life will be like without her, who was the centre of everything.&quot; Beatrice&#x27;s public appearances continued, but her position at court was diminished. She, unlike her sister Louise, was not close to her brother, now Edward VII, and was not included in the King&#x27;s inner circle. Although their relationship did not break down completely, it was occasionally strained, for example when she accidentally (but noisily) dropped her service book from the royal gallery onto a table of gold plate during his coronation.

After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother&#x27;s personal photographs and belongings removed and some of them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the house to be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new king had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.

However, the King did not want the house himself, and he offered it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice&#x27;s nephew George, who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward subsequently extended the grounds of Beatrice&#x27;s home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the prime minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother&#x27;s memory.

===Queen Victoria&#x27;s journals===
Upon Queen Victoria&#x27;s death, Beatrice began the momentous task of transcribing and editing her mother&#x27;s journals. The hundreds of volumes from 1831 onwards contained the Queen&#x27;s personal views of the day-to-day business of her life and included personal and family matters as well as matters of state.

Queen Victoria had given Beatrice the task of editing the journals for publication, which meant removing private material as well as passages that, if published, might be hurtful to living people. Beatrice deleted so much material that the edited journals are only a third as long as the originals. The destruction of such large passages of Queen Victoria&#x27;s diaries distressed Beatrice&#x27;s nephew, George V, and his wife Queen Mary, who were powerless to intervene. Beatrice copied a draft from the original and then copied her draft into a set of blue notebooks. Both the originals and her first drafts were destroyed as she progressed. The task took thirty years and was finished in 1931. The surviving 111 notebooks are kept in the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle.

===Retirement from public life===
Beatrice continued to appear in public after her mother&#x27;s death. The public engagements she carried out were often related to her mother, Queen Victoria, as the public had always associated Beatrice with the deceased monarch.
The beauty of Beatrice&#x27;s daughter, Ena, was known throughout Europe, and, despite her low rank, she was a desirable bride. Her chosen suitor was Alfonso XIII of Spain. However, the marriage caused controversy in Britain, since it required Ena to convert to Catholicism. This step was opposed by Beatrice&#x27;s brother, Edward VII, and Spanish ultra-conservatives were against the King&#x27;s marriage to a Protestant of low birth, as her father, Prince Henry, was the son of a morganatic marriage. Thus, they considered Ena to be only partly royal and thus unfit to be Queen of Spain. Nonetheless, the couple wed on 31 May 1906. The marriage began inauspiciously when an anarchist attempted to bomb them on their wedding day. Apparently close at first, the couple grew apart. Ena became unpopular in Spain and grew more so when it was discovered that her son, the heir-apparent to the throne, suffered from haemophilia. Alfonso held Beatrice responsible for having brought the disease to the Spanish royal house and turned bitterly against Ena.

During her time as Queen of Spain, Ena returned many times to visit her mother in Britain, but always without Alfonso and usually without her children. Meanwhile, Beatrice lived at Osborne Cottage in East Cowes until she sold it in 1913, when Carisbrooke Castle, home of the Governor of the Isle of Wight, became vacant. She moved into the Castle while keeping an apartment at Kensington Palace in London. She had been much involved in collecting material for the Carisbrooke Castle museum, which she opened in 1898.
Her presence at court further decreased as she aged. Devastated by the death of her favourite son, Maurice, during the First World War in 1914, she began to retire from public life. In response to war with Germany, George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor and at the same time adopted it as the family surname, to downplay their German origins. Subsequently, Beatrice and her family renounced their German titles; Beatrice stopped using the style &quot;Princess Henry of Battenberg&quot;, reverting to only using her birth style, &quot;HRH The Princess Beatrice&quot;. Her sons gave up their style, &quot;Prince of Battenberg&quot;. Alexander, the eldest, became Sir Alexander Mountbatten and was later given the title Marquess of Carisbrooke in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Her younger son, Leopold, became Lord Leopold Mountbatten and was given the rank of a younger son of a marquess. He was a haemophiliac, having inherited the &quot;royal disease&quot; from his mother, and died during a knee operation in 1922 one month short of his 33rd birthday.

Following the war, Beatrice was one of several members of the royal family who became patrons of The Ypres League, a society founded for veterans of the Ypres Salient and bereaved relatives of those killed in fighting in the Salient. She was herself a bereaved mother, as her son, Prince Maurice of Battenberg, had been killed in action during the First Battle of Ypres. Rare public appearances after his death included commemorations, including laying wreaths at the Cenotaph in 1930 and 1935 to mark the 10th and 15th anniversaries of the founding of the League.

===Last years===

Even in her seventies, Beatrice continued to correspond with her friends and relatives and to make rare public appearances, such as when, pushed in a wheelchair, she viewed the wreaths laid after the death of her nephew George V in 1936. She published her last work of translation in 1941. Entitled &quot;In Napoleonic Days&quot;, it was the personal diary of Queen Victoria&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Augusta, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She corresponded with the publisher, John Murray, who greatly approved of the work. She made her last home at Brantridge Park in West Sussex, which was owned by Queen Mary&#x27;s brother, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, and his wife, Princess Alice, who was Beatrice&#x27;s niece; the Athlones were at the time in Canada where the Earl was governor-general. There, Beatrice died in her sleep on 26 October 1944, aged eighty-seven (the day before the 30th anniversary of her son, Prince Maurice&#x27;s death). After her funeral service in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, her coffin was placed in the royal vault on 3 November. On 27 August 1945, her body was transferred and placed inside a joint tomb, alongside her husband, in St Mildred&#x27;s Church, Whippingham. Beatrice&#x27;s final wish, to be buried with her husband on the island most familiar to her, was fulfilled in a private service at Whippingham attended only by her son, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, and his wife.

==Legacy==
Beatrice was the shyest of all of Queen Victoria&#x27;s children. However, because she accompanied Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer as well as a keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled. She played the piano to professional standards and was an occasional composer. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.

The demands made on Beatrice during her mother&#x27;s reign were high. Despite suffering from rheumatism, Beatrice was forced to endure her mother&#x27;s love of cold weather. Beatrice&#x27;s piano playing suffered as her rheumatism got gradually worse, eliminating an enjoyment in which she excelled; however, this did not change her willingness to cater to her mother&#x27;s needs. Her effort did not go unnoticed by the British public.
In 1886, when she agreed to open the Show of the Royal Horticultural Society of Southampton, the organisers sent her a proclamation of thanks, expressing their &quot;admiration of the affectionate manner in which you have comforted and assisted your widowed mother our Gracious Sovereign the Queen&quot;. As a wedding present, Sir Moses Montefiore, a banker and philanthropist, presented Beatrice and Henry with a silver tea service inscribed: &quot;Many daughters have acted virtuously, but thou excellest them all.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, shortly before Beatrice&#x27;s marriage, wrote: &quot;The devotion of your Royal Highness to our beloved Sovereign has won our warmest admiration and our deepest gratitude. May those blessings which it has hitherto been your constant aim to confer on others now be returned in full measure to yourself.&quot; The sentence was, as far as it dared, criticising the Queen&#x27;s hold over her daughter.

She died at Brantridge Park, the home of her niece, Princess Alice, and her husband, the Earl of Athlone, at the time serving as Governor General of Canada. Osborne House, her mother&#x27;s favourite home, is accessible to the public. Her Osborne residences, Osborne and Albert Cottages, remain in private ownership after their sale in 1912.

<text>Reginald (or Reyner) Wolfe (died 1573) was a Dutch-born English Protestant printer and one of the original members of the Royal Stationers&#x27; Company.

==Life==
Wolfe was born in Druten in the Netherlands. A learned and devout Protestant, he settled in England some time before 1530 and established himself as a bookseller at St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, London. Wolfe began to print in 1542. He was the first printer in England to maintain a large stock of Greek type. Edward VI made him Royal Printer in Latin, Greek and Hebrew and awarded him an annuity of 26s. 8d. for life. Despite his Protestantism, Mary made him one of the original members of the Stationers&#x27; Company. Under Elizabeth, he served as Master of the Company in 1559, 1564, 1567 and 1572.

Wolfe published works by Archbishop Cranmer, the antiquarian John Leland, Robert Recorde and Archbishop Parker. In 1548, he conceived a project for a &quot;Universal Cosmography of the whole world, and therewith also certain particular histories of every known nation.&quot; He hired Raphael Holinshed and William Harrison to assist in the task, but it remained unfinished at Wolfe&#x27;s death in 1573. Much of the material was published by Holinshed in 1577 as &quot;The Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot; (usually known as Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles).

==Family==
Wolfe married Joan (died 1574), who briefly ran his business after his death. The family included sons John and Robert, a daughter who married John Harrison, another bookseller, and Elizabeth who married Stephen Nevinson.

<text>The common snipe (Gallinago gallinago) is a small, stocky wader native to the Old World.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The breeding habitats are marshes, bogs, tundra and wet meadows throughout the Palearctic. In the north, the distribution limit extends from Iceland over the north of the British Isles and northern Fennoscandia, where it occurs at around 70°N, as well as through European Russia and Siberia. Here it is mostly on the northern edge of the Taiga zone at 71°N, but reaches 74°N on the east coast of the Taymyr Peninsula. In the east it extends to Anadyr, Kamchatka, Bering Island and the Kuril Islands, The southern boundary of the distribution area in Europe runs through northern Portugal, central France, northern Italy, Bulgaria, and Ukraine, with populations in the west being only very scattered. In Asia, the distribution extends south to northern Turkestan, locally to Afghanistan and the Middle East, through the Altai and further to Manchuria and Ussuri. It is migratory, with European birds wintering in southern and western Europe and Africa (south to the Equator), and Asian migrants moving to tropical southern Asia.

==Taxonomy==
The common snipe was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Scolopax gallinago&quot;. The species is now placed with 17 other snipe in the genus &quot;Gallinago&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The name &quot;gallinago&quot; is Neo-Latin for a woodcock or snipe from Latin &quot;gallina&quot;, &quot;hen&quot; and the suffix &quot;-ago&quot;, &quot;resembling&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;G. g. faeroeensis&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1831) – breeds in Iceland, Faroe Islands, Orkney and Shetland Islands; non-breeding in British Isles
* &quot;G. g. gallinago&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – nominate subspecies; breeds in central, north Europe and Asia; non-breeding in west Europe, Africa, Indonesia and Japan
The North American Wilson&#x27;s snipe was previously considered the same species, and is listed as such in older field guides.

==Description==

Adults are in length with a wingspan and a weight of (up to pre-migration). They have short greenish-grey legs and a very long () straight dark bill. The body is mottled brown with straw-yellow stripes on top and pale underneath. They have a dark stripe through the eye, with light stripes above and below it. The wings are pointed.

The common snipe is the most widespread of several similar snipes. It most closely resembles the Wilson&#x27;s snipe (&quot;G. delicata&quot;) of North America, which was until recently considered to be a subspecies – &quot;G. g. delicata&quot; – of the common snipe. They differ in the number of tail feathers, with seven pairs in &quot;G. gallinago&quot; and eight pairs in &quot;G. delicata&quot;; the North American species also has a slightly thinner white trailing edge to the wings (the white is mostly on the tips of the secondaries). Both species breed in the Aleutian Islands. It is also very similar to the pin-tailed snipe (&quot;G. stenura&quot;) and Swinhoe&#x27;s snipe (&quot;G. megala&quot;) of eastern Asia; identification of these species there is complex.

The subspecies &quot;faeroeensis&quot; is normally more richly toned on the breast, its upperparts and the head than the nominate &quot;gallinago&quot;.

==Behaviour==
The common snipe is a well camouflaged bird, it is usually shy and conceals itself close to ground vegetation and flushes only when approached closely. When flushed, they utter a sharp note that sounds like &quot;scape, scape&quot; and fly off in a series of aerial zig-zags to confuse predators. They forage in soft mud, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and earthworms, also some plant material.
The male performs &quot;winnowing&quot; display during courtship, flying high in circles and then taking shallow dives to produce a &quot;drumming&quot; sound by vibrating its tail feathers. This sound has been compared by others to the bleating of a sheep or goat; hence in many languages the snipe is known by names signifying &quot;flying goat&quot;, &quot;heaven&#x27;s ram&quot;, as in Scotland by &quot;heather-bleater&quot; and in Finnish the name &quot;taivaanvuohi&quot;, &quot;sky goat&quot;.

Philip Manson-Bahr is credited with unravelling the mystery of how the snipe creates that unusual breathy sound which is unlike other birdsong. He worked out that the sound was created by placing out two tail feathers at 90 degrees to the direction of flight. When diving these feathers create this unusual sound. He demonstrated this in front of the British Ornithologists Union by inserting two snipe feathers into a cork which he then whirled around his head on a string.

Wing shape does not differ between sedentary and migratory common snipe, suggesting that social selection influences wing shape given this species aerial displays during courtship.

===Breeding===
Common snipe nest in a well-hidden location on the ground, laying four eggs of a dark olive colour, blotched and spotted with rich brown, which are incubated by the female for 18–21 days. The freshly hatched young are covered in dark maroon down, variegated with black, white and buff. The young are cared for by both parents, each parent looking after half the brood, with fledging in 10–20 days.

==Conservation==

Overall, the species is not threatened. Populations on the southern fringes of the breeding range in Europe are however declining with local extinction in some areas (notably in parts of England and Germany), mainly due to field drainage and agricultural intensification.

The Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies to the species. It is still hunted as a gamebird in much of its range.

==History==
Old folk names include &quot;mire snipe&quot;, &quot;horse gowk&quot;, &quot;heather bleat&quot;, and the variant spelling &quot;snite&quot;. See snipe for other aspects of the name.

<doc id="313614" wikidata="Q539891" url="?curid=313614" title="Ramiro de León Carpio">
<text>Ramiro de León Carpio (12 January 1942 – 16 April 2002) was a Guatemalan politician who served as the 43rd president of Guatemala from June 1993 until January 1996. He served as Guatemala&#x27;s Attorney for Human Rights from August 1987 to June 1993.

==Career==
De León studied law at the University of San Carlos and then at the Rafael Landívar University, where he ran the &quot;Sol Bolivariano&quot; (&quot;Bolivarian Sun&quot;) newspaper. After graduating, he became a state civil servant, working in the Common Market division of the Ministry of Economy between 1967 and 1969, when he became the permanent secretary of the tariff committee. In 1970, he became permanent secretary for the National Committee for Economic and Political Integration. During this time, he joined the right-wing National Liberation Movement (MLN), whose candidate, Carlos Arana, won the 1970 presidential elections. During Arana&#x27;s four-year term, de León served as secretary general of the State Advisory Board. He then moved to the private sector, joining the Guatemala Association of Sugar Producers, serving as their legal advisor between 1978 and 1981, and then as their general administrator until 1983. He then became involved in the bloodless coup that saw President Efraín Ríos Montt replaced by Óscar Humberto Mejía.

Along with his cousin Jorge Carpio Nicolle, he co-founded the center-right Unity of the National Center (UCN) party. It opposed authoritarianism and instead proposed social liberalism. He became one of the party&#x27;s 21 deputies in 1984. He played an important role in developing the 1985 Constitution, which is still in force today. He supported his cousin in the latter&#x27;s attempt to win the 1985 presidential election. Carpio got to the second round but was then defeated by Vinicio Cerezo. De León then resigned from the UCN.

In 1989 de Leon became &quot;Defensor del Pueblo&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Defender&quot;), Guatemala&#x27;s human rights ombudsman. While this allowed him to denounce human rights abuses by the powers that be (and be heard when he did it), he did not have any actual power to combat these abuses.

==President (1993-1996)==
On 25 May 1993, President Jorge Serrano led an autocoup – a coup d&#x27;état by someone(s) in the country&#x27;s governmentdissolving the constitution and the National Congress with the apparent support of the army. He further ordered the arrest of de León. He avoided arrest by escaping over the roofs of the adjacent houses, and was then able to send out a condemnation of the coup. Amid protests and suspension of foreign aid, on 1 June, Serrano was forced to flee the country. The army wanted to install the conservative Gustavo Espina, vice president under Serrano, as the new President. De León had already accused him of violating the constitution during the autocoup. On 5 June Espina resigned, and after an overwhelming vote of confidence from the reconvened National Congress, de León was quickly sworn in as President until 14 January 1996, the day Serrano was due to finish his term.

De León promised to defend public freedoms and the rule of law, make progress in the negotiations with the guerrillas, and purge the armed forces of their bad apples. He fired the defense minister General José Domingo García Samayoa, replacing him with General Jorge Roberto Perussina Rivera, who had been implicated in the massacres of the 1980s. On 3 July, his cousin Jorge Carpio, who was playing a vital role in the peace negotiations, was assassinated by right-wingers. On 26 August, he demanded that both all the deputies in the National Congress and all the members of the Supreme Court of Justice resign. This created a crisis that was not resolved until 16 November, resulting in 43 amendments to the 1985 constitution, which were approved in a referendum on 30 January 1994.
On 6 January, negotiations began with the leading guerrilla group, the URNG, but this time under the auspices of both the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS), and with a reduced role of the Guatemalan military in comparison with the previous negotiations. On 29 March, he signed the Global Accord on Human Rights, which, amongst other things, demanded the disbandment of the &quot;Autodefence Civil Patrols&quot; (PAC), which had been accused of involvement in the massacres occurring during the Civil War.

Both the murder of Supreme Court chief Eduardo Epaminondas González Dubón on 3 April and a massacre of civilians by soldiers in Xamán, department of Alta Verapaz, on 5 October 1995, created high levels of tension in the country, and put strains on the peace process. Yet, despite these tensions, free elections were able to be held under de León&#x27;s tenure. On 14 August 1994, 80 of the 116 seats in the National Congress came up for election, which was Guatemala, where the members of Congress normally stand for election to coincide with the presidential election. On 12 November 1995, a new presidential election was held, and in the second round on 7 January 1996, Álvaro Arzú won to succeed de León.

==Post-presidency==
In October 1996, de Leon became a deputy in the Central American Parliament. During the next few years, he worked as an international advisor and was an election monitor for the OAS. In 1999, he joined the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) and was elected to the Congress in the November elections. Then, on 11 March 2002, he resigned his seat in the Congress and from the FRG, declaring that he wished he had never accepted their leader Efraín Ríos Montt&#x27;s invitation to join the party. He intended was to write his memoirs and reinvolve himself in international work. However, he died while visiting Miami, United States, on 16 April, probably from a diabetic coma. National mourning was declared, and he was given a state funeral. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Collar of the Sovereign National Congress.

<doc id="313616" wikidata="Q1264416" url="?curid=313616" title="1992 Croatian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Croatia for the first time on 2 August 1992 alongside simultaneous parliamentary elections. The result was a victory for incumbent Franjo Tuđman of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), who received 58% of the vote, becoming the first popularly elected president of Croatia. Voter turnout was 75%.

The 1,519,000 votes received by Tuđman remains the highest number of votes received by any president to date. Having previously been selected as president by Parliament, he was sworn in for his first constitutional five-year term as president on 12 August 1992 at Saint Mark&#x27;s square in Zagreb.

==Conduct==
The elections were criticised by international observers, who noted several problems, including issues with opposition access to state media, the timing of the election and the impartiality of officials. The timing was deemed to be favourable to the HDZ government, who had delayed approving electoral laws in violation of the country&#x27;s new constitution. The period of time between the announcement of the elections and the election date itself was considered &quot;unusually short&quot;, making it difficult for opposition parties and election officials to prepare. The elections were also scheduled for a holiday, when a significant number of people would be away from their home towns and unable to vote.

<text>Presidential elections were held in Croatia on 15 June 1997. They were the second presidential elections held since independence in 1991. The result was a victory for incumbent president Franjo Tuđman, the leader of the Croatian Democratic Union party (HDZ), who received 61.40% of the vote and was re-elected to a second five-year term. As Tuđman received a majority of the valid votes cast on election day there was no need for a run-off. President Tuđman received a plurality of the votes in 20 of Croatia&#x27;s 21 counties, while Vlado Gotovac did so in Istria County.
Voter turnout in the election was 54.62%, which was a large decline from the 74.9% turnout registered five years previous. Furthermore, about 459.000 fewer votes were cast in comparison to the previous election in 1992. The elections also featured the smallest number of presidential candidates to date, with only three taking part: Franjo Tuđman, Zdravko Tomac and Vlado Gotovac. The margin of victory (over 40%) is also the largest in any election to date.

OSCE delegation observing the elections concluded that &quot;the process leading up to the election was fundamentally flawed, and did not meet the minimum standards for a meaningful and democratic election in line with OSCE standards.&quot;

==Background==
On February 22, the incumbent president Tudman was re-nominated by his party HDZ to seek a re-election bid.

In April, two months earlier, local elections and elections for the upper chamber of the parliament were held. Local elections showed weakening of HDZ position in urban centers. The aftermath of Zagreb crisis and the protests against silencing Radio 101, an independent and critical media outlet, additionally led to a drop of government approval. It was also widely rumoured that 75-year-old president Tudman is suffering from cancer and his health was a major topic of speculation.

Political parties in opposition to the ruling HDZ pondered agreeing on a single candidate to challenge Tudman. Scholar Ivan Supek was mentioned, but nothing came out of it. SDP and HNS toyed with the idea to jointly support HSLS candidate, poet and philosopher, MP Vlado Gotovac, but SDP ended up supporting Tomac&#x27;s bid. The rift in the united opposition was evident during the local elections earlier in the year, when HSS and HSLS distanced themselves from SDP. According to journalist Vlado Vurusic, SDP&#x27;s Tomac chose to run knowing he stood little chance in order to legitimize the elections and build further visibility for the opposition. Analysts believed that opposition&#x27;s goal was to at least secure a run-off, preventing an absolute majority in the first round.

Before the start of the official campaign, president Tudman&#x27;s 75th birthday on 14 May was lavishly celebrated in Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, culminating with a three-hour play showing his presidency as a peak of Croatian national history. Croatian National Bank minted a commemorative coin, while Croatian Post issued a stamp celebrating his birthday. State television broadcast an extensive multi-part documentary about Tudjman&#x27;s life as well. In a state-funded campaign, charity concert &quot;All Croatian Victories for Vukovar&quot; was promoted throughout the country with billboards and posters depicting the president.

There were further concerns regarding access to polls. According to the OSCE, &quot;as many as 300,000 lifelong (primarily ethnic Serb) residents who fled the country&quot; during the 1991-5 war were disenfranchised, facing severe political, legal and administrative hurdles preventing them from voting. On the other hand, approximately 330,000 Bosnian Croats were given the vote due to their Croatian citizenship. Citizens living in the eastern Slavonia, formerly Serb rebel-held areas and under UN administration at the time, were to vote for the first time in national elections. They had already voted in local elections in April.

==Candidates==
===Failed candidacies===
*Dobroslav Paraga, chairman of HSP-1861, gathered just 8,462 signatures supporting his bid, thus failing to reach 10,000 hurdle.

==Campaign==
Tudman officially launched his campaign on 28 May, presenting his manifesto at a reception in Klovićevi Dvori Gallery in Zagreb. On 30 May, Statehood Day, a military parade was organized along Jarun lake in Zagreb, prominently featuring Tudman as the commander-in-chief. At an estimated cost of 16 million DEM, parade&#x27;s exact purpose was questioned by media. HDZ campaign committee published an election manifesto in all daily newspapers including a list of 800 public personas and celebrities officially supporting Tudman&#x27;s re-election bid. However, several of the listed were under-age, while a number of artists and celebrities listed afterwards issued a public rebuttal, stating that they were never consulted on the matter. The list included public broadcaster director as well.

On 8 June president Tudjman visited Vukovar and eastern Slavonia for the second time. The area was previously occupied by rebel ethnic Serb authorities and was under the transitional authority of United Nations&#x27; administration at the time. Peaceful local elections took place throughout the region in April and gradual reintegration in Croatia was going according to plan and scheduled to be completed in 1998. Now, however, Tudjman visited Vukovar in a 21-car railway composition dubbed &quot;The Peace Train&quot;, bringing many politicians, dignitaries and celebrities with him and stopping for whistle-stop rallies on his way from Zagreb. In a Zagreb whistle-stop rally, he viciously attacked the opposition in general as &quot;a handful of sold-out Judas&#x27; sons.&quot; Holding a conciliatory speech in Vukovar, Tudman fostered responsibility, cooperation and reconciliation between Croats and ethnic Serbs. However, he explicitly rejected the return of all Serb refugees to Croatia. All of these events were given significant coverage by state-owned media, which virtually avoided any display of (or news on) other candidates and opposition&#x27;s activities, campaign, etc. Croatian Television was also criticized for a particularly slanted approach, heavily promoting Tudman. HDZ ran a fierce defamation campaign against Tomac and Gotovac.

With unemployment running at 17%, Tomac and Gotovac campaigned against nepotism, corruption, and economic inequality, also attacking Tudman&#x27;s authoritarianism and politicization of army, police, and public broadcaster. Tudman dismissed the unemployment figures, claiming that only 9% were &quot;actually&quot; unemployed. Tomac&#x27;s slogan was &quot;a president with neither Brijuni nor the [presidential] plane&quot;, hinting at the high-end Tudman&#x27;s lifestyle and the cost of the president&#x27;s office and his Brijuni summer residence. While Tomac promoted social justice, addressing people depending on wages not capital income, and spoke about labour-capital conflict, Gotovac was more focused on civil liberties. They both advocated changing the constitution and transitioning towards full parliamentary democracy and curtailing presidential powers.

Tudman believed not to be on par with the other two candidates, thus dismissing interviews and press statements as unnecessary and unworthy of his position. (he did give a pre-arranged interview, broadcast on public TV). As a consequence, his deputy head of staff, Vesna Škare-Ožbolt, answered many questions in his name without Tudman&#x27;s knowledge. No debates were held.

Access to marketing and campaign funding was severely unequal; Tudman&#x27;s ads on TV ran for more than 2,000 seconds during the last week of the campaign, while Gotovac and Tomac combined had a total of 101 seconds. Gotovac and Tomac&#x27;s posters and billboards were virtually absent from sight. Furthermore, Tomac&#x27;s campaign van was stoned near Zadar.

===Pula incident===

On 5 June opposition candidate Vlado Gotovac (HSLS) was physically attacked during his rally in Pula by Croatian Army captain Tomislav Brzović of the elite 1st Guards Corps, who wore dress uniform. The attacker hit him in the head with his belt, shouting &quot;I am an ustasha, long live Ante Pavelić!&quot;, later threatening to kill everyone present. Gotovac suffered a concussion and was hospitalised for four days. Having to suspend his activities for further 10 days, the opposition jointly - albeit unsuccessfully - petitioned the electoral commission to suspend the campaign altogether until Gotovac recovers. Captain Brzovic was suspended for several months from active duty and received a conditional sentence, but was not ultimately discharged from army and resumed his commissioned duties. President Tudman neither reached out to Gotovac nor condemned the attack, even going as far as calling opposition candidates &quot;headless&quot; and &quot;confused&quot; in Vukovar.

== Opinion polls==
==Results==
Tomac and Gotovac fared better in cities, with Gotovac coming second in Split (32%-21%) and narrowly third in Rijeka.

Out of 377,705 citizens living abroad eligible to vote, 88,728 (23.5%) eventually did so, predominantly in Bosnia and Herzegovina (48 thousand out of 140,742 eligible to vote) and Germany (23 thousand). In total, 81,107 (91.4%) voted for Tudman, 2,676 for Tomac, and 4,463 for Gotovac.

Voter turnout was fairly low in Eastern Slavonia, then under UN administration and with an ethnic Serb majority. UNTAES complained that Croatian authorities did not update voting records in time, which left some 10% of those who did turn out to cast a ballot without a vote. Voter turnout was also low in some opposition-friendly regions; for instance, in Krapina-Zagorje county it stood around 40%. Turnout was highest in Pozega-Slavonia County (51,38%), while Zadar county reported lowest figures - just 34,5%.

==Aftermath==

U.S. Senator Paul Simon, special OSCE coordinator for monitoring the elections, reported that &quot;Croatia has experienced a free but not fair election. While candidates were able to speak freely, the process leading up to the election was fundamentally flawed. It did not meet the minimum standards for democracies. By contrast the election itself was - with some exceptions - conducted efficiently.&quot;

HDZ fell short of its proclaimed 70% vote target, but still celebrated with fireworks and an open-air party in Zagreb. Government-friendly&quot;Vjesnik&quot; commented that the electorate had rejected political experiments, opting for continuity. Tuđman took the oath of office for a second term on 5 August 1997 at Saint Mark&#x27;s Square. He chose the inauguration date to coincide with the anniversary of the military operation &quot;Storm&quot; that ended the war in Croatia two years earlier. Croatian jurist and constitutional expert, Branko Smerdel, in 2000 opined that the 1997 elections saw a transition from Tudman&#x27;s &quot;imperial war-time presidency&quot; to &quot;an elective monarchy&quot;, as Tudman afterwards hoarded power in his various councils, advisory bodies and committees. However, he served only a little more than two years of his new 5-year term, as he died on 10 December 1999, triggering early elections being called for January 2000. Vlatko Pavletić assumed the post of Acting President as the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament.

SDP&#x27;s result as runners-up, prevailing over HSLS, was important in establishing them as a leading opposition party and a senior partner in building the coalition (August 1998) that eventually won the 2000 parliamentary elections and formed the first post-HDZ government. SDP showed further growth continuity in the polls and stabilized its vote share. In 1998, SDP chairman Ivica Račan was far ahead of president Tudman in popularity polls. In 1998, HDZ could not form a majority in two counties (Primorje-Gorski Kotar and Dubrovnik-Neretva) and was forced to call the elections, which were won by the united opposition.

Gotovac was disappointed with his result and the &quot;lack of a political centre in Croatia,&quot; warning against &quot;bi-polarization&quot; of Croatian politics. His 17% vote share as a candidate of several largest opposition parties in Sabor showed their loss of credibility as an alternative. Much lower turnout than at both April local elections (70%) and previous presidential elections in 1992 was seen by some as a sign of voter apathy and their perception of the unfairness of the electoral process, but also as a loss of credibility in HSS, HSLS and HNS, whose councilors frequently crossed the floor after the elections, thus enabling HDZ to form the majority in several cities and counties despite their failure to achieve so at the ballot. Gotovac&#x27;s failure to beat Tomac was a trigger for an intra-party clash in HSLS, exposing the rift between more nationalist-friendly Budisa (who flirted with HDZ during local elections) and Zagreb party organization on one side and Gotovac on the other. Budisa was elected party chairman, while Gotovac left the party, forming a splinter Liberal Party in January 1998.

According to political scientist Trevor Waters, after the elections &quot;support for Tudjman and the HDZ fell sharply amid widespread allegations of corruption, cronyism and nepotism, particularly with regard to the privatisation of state-owned assets.&quot; Fractional in-fighting amongst HDZ became apparent as the united opposition started rising in the opinion polls.

<text>Gustavo Adolfo Espina Salguero (26 November 1946 – 23 October 2024) was a Guatemalan politician who served as vice president from 1991 to 1993 under President Jorge Serrano and Later Acting President for 4 days During the 1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis.

==Life and career==
Espina Salguero was born in Horcones, Jutiapa, Guatemala, on 26 November 1946.

Serrano attempted a self-coup on 25 May 1993, but was forced to flee into exile on 1 June. Espina proclaimed himself interim president but was never recognized. He spent the following years in exile and, in 1997, returned voluntarily to stand trial for his involvement in the coup. He was convicted of violating the constitution, but his sentence was commuted to a small fine.

Espina Salguero died on 23 October 2024, at the age of 77.

<doc id="313624" wikidata="Q64927" url="?curid=313624" title="Wilson's snipe">
<text>Wilson&#x27;s snipe (Gallinago delicata) is a small, stocky shorebird. The generic name &quot;Gallinago&quot; is Neo-Latin for a woodcock or snipe from Latin &quot;gallina&quot;, &quot;hen&quot; and the suffix &quot;-ago&quot;, &quot;resembling&quot;. The specific name &quot;delicata&quot; is Latin for &quot;dainty&quot;.

This species was considered to be a subspecies of the common snipe (&quot;G. gallinago&quot;) until 2003 when it was given its own species status, though not all authorities recognized this immediately. Wilson&#x27;s snipe differs from the latter species in having a narrower white trailing edge to the wings, and eight pairs of tail feathers instead of the typical seven of the common snipe. Its common name commemorates the American ornithologist Alexander Wilson.

==Description==
Adults are in length with a wingspan. Weight ranges from . They have short greenish-grey legs and a very long straight dark bill. The body is mottled brown on top and pale underneath. They have a dark stripe through the eye, with light stripes above and below it. The wings are pointed.

==Breeding and habits==

They breed in marshes, bogs, tundra and wet meadows in Canada and the northern United States and on the Chukchi Peninsula, Russia. They are year-round residents on the U.S. Pacific coast. The eastern population migrates to the southern United States, the Caribbean, and to northern South America. It may be that climate change causes these birds to move to their breeding range earlier and leave later than 100 years ago. In Ohio for example, late April was recorded as an average migration date in 1906, but now most of the local population is present on the breeding grounds by then already.

They forage in soft mud, probing or picking up food by sight and eating insects, earthworms, and plant material. Well-camouflaged, they are usually shy and conceal themselves close to ground vegetation, flushing only when approached closely. They fly off in a series of aerial zig-zags to confuse predators.

The male performs &quot;winnowing&quot; display during courtship, flying high in circles and then taking shallow dives to produce a distinctive sound. They have been observed &quot;winnowing&quot; throughout the day and long into the night. The &quot;winnowing&quot; sound is similar to the call of a boreal owl. They nest in a well-hidden location on the ground.

==Population==
Wilson&#x27;s snipe was reduced near the end of the 19th century by hunting and habitat destruction. However, this bird remains fairly common and not considered threatened by the IUCN, although local populations are sensitive to large-scale draining of wetland.

<text>Kimberley is the capital and largest city of the Northern Cape province of South Africa. It is located approximately 110 km east of the confluence of the Vaal and Orange Rivers. The city has considerable historical significance because of its diamond mining past and the siege during the Second Boer War. The British businessmen Cecil Rhodes and Barney Barnato made their fortunes in Kimberley, and Rhodes also established the De Beers diamond company in the early days of the mining town.

On 2 September 1882, Kimberley was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere and the second in the world after Philadelphia, in the United States, to install electric street lighting. The first stock exchange in Africa was built in Kimberley as early as 1881.

== History ==

=== Discovery of diamonds ===
In 1866, Erasmus Jacobs found a small brilliant pebble on the banks of the Orange River, on the farm &quot;De Kalk&quot; leased from local Griquas, near Hopetown, which was his father&#x27;s farm. He showed the pebble to his father, who then sold it. The pebble was purchased from Jacobs&#x27; father by Schalk van Niekerk, who later sold it on again. It proved to be a diamond, and became known as the Eureka. Three years later, in 1869, an diamond, which became known as the Star of South Africa, was found nearby (). This diamond was sold by van Niekerk for £11,200, and later resold in the London market for £25,000.
Henry Richard Giddy recounted how Esau Damoense (or Damon), the cook for prospector Fleetwood Rawstorne&#x27;s &quot;Red Cap Party&quot;, found diamonds in 1871 on Colesberg Kopje after he was sent there to dig as punishment. Rawstorne took the news to the nearby diggings of the De Beer brothers, his arrival there sparking off the famous &quot;New Rush&quot;, which, as the historian Brian Roberts puts it, was practically a stampede. Within a month, 900 claims were cut into the hillock, which were worked frenetically by two to three thousand men. As the land was lowered, so the hillock became a mine, in time the world-renowned Kimberley Mine.

The Cape Colony, Transvaal, Orange Free State and the Griqua leader Nicolaas Waterboer all laid claim to the diamond fields. The Free State Boers in particular wanted the area, as it lay inside the natural borders created by Orange and the Vaal Rivers. Following the mediation that was overseen by the Governor of Natal, the Keate Award went in favour of Waterboer, who placed himself under British protection. Consequently, the territory known as Griqualand West was proclaimed on 27 October 1871.

===Naming the place: from Vooruitzigt to New Rush to Kimberley===
Colonial Commissioners arrived in New Rush on 17 November 1871 to exercise authority over the territory on behalf of the Cape Governor. Digger objections and minor riots led to Governor Barkly&#x27;s visit to New Rush in September the following year, when he revealed a plan instead to have Griqualand West proclaimed a Crown Colony.

Richard Southey would arrive as Lieutenant-Governor of the intended Crown Colony in January 1873. Months passed however without any sign of the proclamation or of the promised new constitution and provision for representative government. The delay was in London, where Secretary of State for the Colonies, John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley, insisted that before electoral divisions could be defined, the places had to receive &quot;decent and intelligible names. His Lordship declined to be in any way connected with such a vulgarism as New Rush and as for the Dutch name, &quot;Vooruitzigt&quot; … he could neither spell nor pronounce it&quot;.

The matter was passed to Southey, who gave it to his Colonial Secretary J.B. Currey. Roberts wrote that &quot;when it came to renaming New Rush, [Currey] proved himself a worthy diplomat. He made quite sure that Lord Kimberley would be able both to spell and pronounce the name of the main electoral division by, as he says, calling it &#x27;after His Lordship&#x27;&quot;. New Rush became Kimberley by a proclamation dated 5 July 1873.

Digger sentiment was expressed in an editorial in the &quot;Diamond Field&quot; newspaper when it stated &quot;we went to sleep in New Rush and waked up in Kimberley, and so our dream was gone&quot;.

Following agreement by the British government on compensation to the Orange Free State for its competing land claims, Griqualand West was annexed to the Cape Colony in 1877.

The Cape Prime Minister John Molteno initially had serious doubts about annexing the heavily indebted region, but after striking a deal with the Home Government and receiving assurances that the local population would be consulted in the process, he passed the Griqualand West Annexation Act on 27 July 1877.
=== Big Hole and other mines ===

As miners arrived in their thousands the hill disappeared and subsequently became known as the Big Hole (or &quot;Kimberley se Gat&quot; in Afrikaans), or, more formally, Kimberley Mine. From mid-July 1871 to 1914, 50,000 miners dug the hole with picks and shovels, yielding 2,722 kg of diamonds. The Big Hole has a surface of and is 463 metres wide. It was excavated to a depth of 240 m but then partially infilled with debris reducing its depth to about 215 m. Since then, it has accumulated water to a depth of 40 m, leaving 175 m visible. Beneath the surface, the Kimberley Mine underneath the Big Hole was mined to a depth of 1097 m. A popular local myth claims that it is the largest hand-dug hole on the world, but Jagersfontein Mine appears to hold that record.

The Big Hole is the principal feature of a May 2004 submission that placed &quot;Kimberley Mines and associated early industries&quot; on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Tentative Lists.

By 1873, Kimberley was the second-largest town in South Africa, with an approximate population of 40,000.

=== Role and influence of De Beers ===
The various smaller mining companies were amalgamated by Cecil Rhodes and Charles Rudd into De Beers, and The Kimberley under Barney Barnato. In 1888, the two companies merged to form De Beers Consolidated Mines, which once had a monopoly over the world&#x27;s diamond market.

Very quickly, Kimberley became the largest city in the area, partly because oof a massive African migration to the area from all over the continent. The immigrants were accepted with open arms, because the De Beers company was in search of cheap labour to help run the mines. Another group drawn to the city for money was prostitutes from a wide variety of ethnicities, who could be found in bars and saloons. It was praised as a city of limitless opportunity.

Five big holes were dug into the earth following the kimberlite pipes, which are named after the town. Kimberlite is a diamond-bearing blue ground that sits below a yellow-coloured soil. The largest, The Kimberley mine or &quot;Big Hole&quot; covering , reached a depth of and yielded three tons of diamonds. The mine was closed in 1914, while three of the holesDutoitspan, Wesselton and Bultfonteinclosed down in 2005.

=== Second Boer War ===


On 14 October 1899, Kimberley was besieged at the beginning of the Second Boer War. The British forces trying to relieve the siege suffered heavy losses. The siege was only lifted on 15 February 1900, but the war continued until May 1902. By that time, the British had built a concentration camp at Kimberley to house Boer women and children.

===Amalgamation===
The hitherto separately administered Boroughs of Kimberley and Beaconsfield amalgamated as the City of Kimberley in 1912.

=== Under Apartheid ===

Although a considerable degree of urban segregation already existed, one of the most significant impacts of Apartheid on the city of Kimberley was the implementation of the Group Areas Act. Communities were divided according to legislated racial categories, namely European (White), Native (Black), Coloured and Indian – now legally separated by the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. Individual families could be split up to three ways (based on such notorious measures as the &#x27;pencil test&#x27;) and mixed communities were either completely relocated (as in Malay Camp – although those clearances began before Apartheid as such) or were selectively cleared (as in Greenpoint, which became a &#x27;Coloured&#x27; Group Area, its erstwhile-African and other residents being removed to other parts of town).

Residential segregation was thus enforced in a process tjhat saw the creation of new townships at the northern and north-eastern edges of the expanding city. Institutions that were hard hit by the Group Areas Act, Bantu Education and other Acts included churches (such as the Bean Street Methodist Church) and schools (some, such as William Pescod and Perseverance School, moved while the Gore Browne (Native) Training School was closed down). Other legislation restricted the movement of Africans and some public places became &#x27;Europeans Only&#x27; preserves in terms of the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act. The Native Laws Amendment Act sought to cleave church communities along racial lines, a law rejected on behalf of all Anglicans in South Africa by Archbishop Clayton in 1957 (in terms of which that aspect of apartheid was never completely implemented in churches such as Kimberley&#x27;s St Cyprian&#x27;s Cathedral).

Resistance to apartheid in Kimberley was mounted as early as mid-1952, as part of the Defiance Campaign. Dr Arthur Letele put together a group of volunteers to defy the segregation laws by occupying &#x27;Europeans Only&#x27; benches at Kimberley Railway Station, which led to arrest and imprisonment. Later that year, the Mayibuye Uprising in Kimberley, on 8 November 1952, revolved around the poor quality of beer served in the beer hall. The fracas resulted in shootings and a subsequent mass funeral on 12 November 1952 at Kimberley&#x27;s West End Cemetery. Detained following the massacre were alleged &#x27;ring-leaders&#x27; Dr Letele, Sam Phakedi, Pepys Madibane, Olehile Sehume, Alexander Nkoane, Daniel Chabalala and David Mpiwa. Archdeacon Wade of St Matthew&#x27;s Church, as a witness at the subsequent inquiry, placed the blame squarely on the policy of apartheid, including poor housing, lighting and public transport, together with &quot;unfulfilled promises&quot;, which he said &quot;brought about the conditions which led to the riots&quot;.

A later generation of anti-apartheid activists based in Kimberley included Phakamile Mabija, Bishop Graham Chadwick and two post-apartheid provincial premiers, Manne Dipico and Dipuo Peters.
Other prominent figures of the struggle against apartheid who had Kimberley connections include Robert Sobukwe, founder of the Pan Africanist Congress, who was banished (placed under house arrest) in Kimberley after his release from Robben Island in 1969. He died in the city in 1978.

Benny Alexander (1955–2010), who later changed his name to Khoisan X and was General Secretary of the Pan Africanist Congress and of the Pan-Africanist Movement from 1989, was born and grew up in Kimberley.

=== Post-Apartheid ===
The Northern Cape Province became a political fact in 1994 with Kimberley as its capital. Some quasi-provincial infrastructure was in place from the 1940s, but after 1994, Kimberley underwent considerable development as administrative departments were set up and housed for the governance of the new province. A Northern Cape Legislature was designed and situated to bridge the formerly-divided city. The Kimberley City Council of the renamed Sol Plaatje Local Municipality (see below) was enlarged. A new coat of arms and motto for the city were ushered in.

With the abolition of apartheid previously &#x27;whites only&#x27; institutions such as schools became accessible to all, as did suburbs previously segregated by the Group Areas Act. In practice, the process has been one of upward mobility by those who could afford the more costly options, but the vast majority of black people remain in the townships, where poverty levels are high.

Major township residential developments, with RDP housing, were implemented not without criticism concerning quality. There has been an increase in Kimberley&#x27;s population since urbanization has been spurred on in part by the abolition of the Influx Control Act.

Also, the settlement of Platfontein was added when the !Xun and Khwe community, formerly of Schmidtsdrift and originally from Angola/Namibia, acquired the land in 1996. Most of the newly-created community had moved to the new township by the end of 2003.

In 1998, the Kimberley Comprehensive Urban Plan estimated that Kimberley had 210,800 people, representing 46,207 households living in the city.

By 2008, estimates were in the region of 250,000 inhabitants.

====Renaming====
The shifts from frontier farm names to digger camp names to the established names of the towns of Kimberley and Beaconsfield, which duly amalgamated in 1912, are outlined above. The only traces of any precolonial settlement within the city&#x27;s boundaries are scatters of Stone Age artefacts and there is no record of what the place/s might have been called before the first nineteenth century frontier overlay of farm names. It lay beyond the areas occupied by Tswana people in the precolonial period. Sites such as the nearby Wildebeest Kuil testify to a Khoe–San history dating up into the nineteenth century.

In the post-1994 era the Kimberley City Council was renamed the Sol Plaatje Local Municipality after the area it served was expanded to include surrounding towns and villages, most notably Ritchie. Sol Plaatje, the prominent writer and activist, lived for much of his life in Kimberley. Similarly the erstwhile Diamantveld District Council became the Frances Baard District Municipality, with reference to the trade unionist, Frances Baard, who was born in Greenpoint, Kimberley.

==Coats of arms==
Municipality – The Kimberley borough council assumed a coat of arms in 1878. The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in December 1964 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in February 1968.

The design was a combination of the Union Jack and the charges from the Cape Colony&#x27;s coat of arms, with a lozenge to represent the diamond-mining industry : &quot;Azure, a cross and saltire superimposed Gules both fimbriated Argent, in chief three bezants Or, each charged with a fleur de lis Azure, and in base three annulets Or; on a lozenge Or, superimposed over the fess point, a lion rampant Gules&quot;. The motto was &quot;Spero meliora&quot;. The arms were depicted on a cigarette card issued in 1931.

The Kimberley divisional council, which administered the rural areas outside the city, registered its own arms at the Bureau in August 1970.

The arms were &quot;Per saltire, in chief, barry wavy of six Argent and Azure; in base, Argent, a pale Sable charged with three fusils Argent; dexter, Gules, a shovel and pick in saltire, handles downward, Or; sinister, a staff of Aesculapius, Or&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms, the shield was divided in four by two diagonal lines, and depicted (1) six silver and blue stripes with wavy edges, (2) a crossed pick and shovel on a red background, (3) a golden staff of Aesculapius, and (4) three silver diamond-shaped fusils on a black vertical stripe on a silver background.

The crest was two crossed rifles in front of an upright sword; the supporters were two kudus; and the motto was &quot;Nitanir semper ad optima&quot;.

==Economy==
Kimberley was the initial hub of industrialisation in South Africa in the late 19th century, which transformed the country&#x27;s agrarian economy into one more dependent on its mineral wealth. A key feature of the new economic arrangement was migrant labour, with the demand for African labour in the mines of Kimberley and later on the gold fields drawing workers in growing numbers from throughout the subcontinent. The labour compound system, developed in Kimberley from the 1880s, was later replicated on the gold mines and elsewhere.

The city housed South Africa&#x27;s first stock exchange, the Kimberley Royal Stock Exchange, which opened on 2 February 1881.
On 2 September 1882, Kimberley became the first town in the Southern Hemisphere to install electric street lighting. The only city in the world to so earlier was Philadephia, in the United States.

The rising importance of Kimberley led to one of the earliest South African and International Exhibitions to be staged in Kimberley in 1892. It was opened by Sir Henry Loch, the then Governor of the Cape of Good Hope on 8 September. It presented exhibits of art, an exhibition of paintings from the royal collection of Queen Victoria and mining machinery and implements amongst other items. The exhibition aroused considerable interest at international level, which resulted in a competition for display space.

South Africa&#x27;s first school of mines was opened here in 1896 and later relocated to Johannesburg, becoming the core of the University of the Witwatersrand. A Pretoria campus later became the University of Pretoria. In fact the first two years were attended at colleges elsewhere, in Cape Town, Grahamstown or Stellenbosch, the third year in Kimberley and the fourth year in Johannesburg. Buildings were constructed against a total cost of 9,000 pounds with De Beers contributing on a pound for pound basis.

===Transport===
====Aviation====
South Africa&#x27;s first school of aviation, to train pilots for the proposed South African Aviation Corps (SAAC), was established in Kimberley in 1913. Known as &quot;Paterson&#x27;s Aviation Syndicate School of Flying&quot;, it is commemorated in the Pioneers of Aviation Museum (and replica of the first Compton Patterson Biplane preserved there), situated near to Kimberley airport. In the 1930s Kimberley boasted the best night-landing facilities on the continent of Africa. A major air rally was hosted there in 1934. In the war years Kimberley Airport was commandeered by the Union Defence Force and run by the 21 Flying School for the training of fighter pilots.

Today Kimberley Airport services the area, with regular scheduled flights from Cape Town and Johannesburg.

====Railways====

Work on connecting Kimberley by rail to the cities along the Cape Colony&#x27;s coastline began in 1872, under the management of the Cape Government Railways. The railway line from Cape Town to Kimberley was completed in 1885, accelerating the transport of both passengers and goods. The railway connected Kimberley with cheaper sources of grain and other products, as well as supplies of coal, so that one of its local impacts was to undercut (mainly African) trade in fresh produce and firewood in Kimberley&#x27;s hinterland. Another footnote to railway history is its role in the initial rapid spread of the Spanish Influenza epidemic in 1918.

The railway reticulation eventually would link Kimberley with Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg, Durban and Bloemfontein. The major junction at De Aar in the Karoo linked early twentieth century lines to Upington (later to Namibia) and to Calvinia. From the 1990s there was a decline in the use of the railways.

Today passenger train services to and from Kimberley are provided by Spoornet&#x27;s Shosholoza Meyl, with connections south to Cape Town and Port Elizabeth and north to Johannesburg. Luxury railway experiences are provided on the main north–south line by the Blue Train and Rovos Rail. The central railway station of Kimberley is Kimberley railway station.

====Roads====
Wagon and coach routes were developed rapidly as the rush for the diamond fields gathered momentum. Two of the major routes were from the Cape and from Port Elizabeth, the nearest maritime port at the time. Contemporary accounts of the 1870s describe the appalling condition of some of the roads and decry the absence of bridges. From the mid-1880s the route through Kimberley and Mafeking (now Mahikeng) became the main axis of British colonial penetration and it was from Kimberley, along that route, that the Pioneer Column for the settlement of Rhodesia set forth in 1890. Today, however, the central arterial route to the north, the N1 from the Cape to Johannesburg, goes via Bloemfontein, not Kimberley.

Kimberley is located at the intersection of the N12 and N8 national roads.

===Today===
Today, Kimberley is the seat of the Provincial Legislature for the Northern Cape and the Provincial Administration. It services the mining and agricultural sectors of the region.

====Tourism====
The city projects itself as a significant tourist destination, the &#x27;City that Sparkles&#x27;, boasting a diversity of museums and visitor attractions. It is also a gateway to other Northern Cape destinations including the Mokala National Park, nature reserves and numerous game farms or hunting lodges, as well as historic sites of the region.

====Conference-hosting====
Kimberley has hosted significant meetings and conferences, developing a major venue, the Mittah Seperepere Convention Centre, and other conference hosting facilities. Recent gatherings have included the founding meeting of the Kimberley Process (2000) and a follow-up meeting of this organisation in 2013, and the International Indigenous Peoples Summit on Sustainable Development (2002).

== Climate and geography ==
=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen system Kimberley has a semi-arid climate (BSh) courtesy of its dry winters. Summers are long, wet, and long lasting. Winters are short, mild, and dry with chilly nights.

===Water===
Kimberley&#x27;s water is pumped from the Vaal River at Riverton, some 15 km north of the city.

===Demography===
According to the 2011 census, the population of Kimberley &quot;proper&quot; was 96,977, while the townships Galeshewe and Roodepan had populations of 107,920 and 20,263 respectively. This gives the urban area a total population of 225,160. Of this population, 63.1% identified themselves as &quot;Black African&quot;, 26.8% as &quot;Coloured&quot;, 8.0% as &quot;White&quot; and 1.2% as &quot;Indian or Asian&quot;. 43.2% of the population spoke Afrikaans as their first language, 35.8% spoke Setswana, 8.7% spoke English, 6.0% spoke isiXhosa and 2.7% spoke Sesotho.

===Landscapes, urban and rural===
Kimberley is set in a relatively flat landscape with no prominent topographic features within the urban limits. The only &quot;hills&quot; are debris dumps generated by more than a century of diamond mining. From the 1990s these were being recycled and poured back into De Beers Mine (by 2010 it was filled to within a few tens of metres of the surface). Certain of the mine dumps, in the vicinity of the Big Hole, have been proclaimed as heritage features and are to be preserved as part of the historic industrial landscape of Kimberley.

The surrounding rural landscape, not more than a few minutes&#x27; drive from any part of the city, consists of relatively flat plains dotted with hills, mainly outcropping basement rock (andesite) to the north and north west, or Karoo age dolerite to the south and east. Shallow pans formed in the plains.

One of Kimberley&#x27;s famous features is Kamfers Dam, a large pan north of the city, which is an important wetland supporting a breeding colony of lesser flamingos. Conservation initiatives in the area aim to bring people from the city in touch with its wildlife. In 2012 rising water levels flooded the artificial island built to enhance flamingo breeding, while in December 2013 a local outbreak of avian botulism bacteria resulted in the deaths of hundreds of birds. The island has since re-emerged.

==Local and provincial government==
The administration of the Crown Colony of Griqualand West (from 1873) was conducted from Government Buildings in Kimberley up until the annexation of the Colony to the Cape in 1880. At the level of local government, separate Borough Councils operated in Kimberley and Beaconsfield up to the time of their amalgamation as the City of Kimberley in 1912. Thereafter a single City Council regulated the affairs of the city, while a Divisional Council administered the surrounding rural district. In the 1980s, in the last days of apartheid, a separate political entity referred to as Galeshewe (with Mankurwane) was brought into existence with its own council.

Post-1994 the Kimberley City Council became the Sol Plaatje Local Municipality while the successor to what had become the Diamandveld Regional Services Council was the Frances Baard District Municipality.

The idea of establishing the Northern Cape as a distinct geographic entity dates from the 1940s but it became a political and administrative fact only in 1994, with Kimberley formally becoming the new province&#x27;s legislative capital. The provincial legislature initially occupied the old Cape Provincial Administration building at the Civic Centre before moving into a purpose-built Legislature deliberately situated between one of the townships and erstwhile white suburbs. Kimberley is also the seat of the Northern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa, which exercises jurisdiction over the province.

===Religion===
Kimberley, from its earliest days, attracted people of diverse faiths, which are still reflected by practising faith communities in the city. Pre-eminently these are various denominations of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, as well as other faiths. Traditional African beliefs continue as an element in the Zionist Christian Church (ZCC). Kimberley is the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman and also of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kimberley – previously the Apostolic Vicariate of Kimberley in Orange. Other denominations having churches in the city are the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Congregational Church, the Dutch Reformed Church (Afrikaans: Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk), the Baptist Church, the Afrikaans Baptist Church (Afrikaans: Afrikaanse Baptiste Kerk), the Apostolics, Pentecostalists.

=== Sport ===
==== Cricket ====

Kimberley has contributed to much of cricket&#x27;s history having supplied several international players. There was Frank (Nipper) Nicholson, Xenophon Balaskas born in Kimberley to Greek parents and Ken Viljoen, Ronnie Draper and in more recent times Pat Symcox and the Proteas coach Mickey Arthur.

Kimberley hosted a match from the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup. Elsie McDonald was a Springbok bowler.

==== Rugby ====

Frank Dobbin known as Uncle Dobbin was a member of Paul Roos&#x27; original Springboks in the tour to the British Isles in 1906/1907. His memory lives in his old colonial-style home in Roper street, bearing a simple brass plaque with the name &#x27;Dobbin&#x27;. Later Springboks to wear green and gold included Ian Kirkpatrick, Tommy Bedford and Gawie Visagie, brother of Ammosal-based Springbok flyhalf Piet Visagie.

Kimberley is home to the Griquas rugby team, which has won the Currie Cup three times in 1899, 1911 and 1970. Ronnie Bauser an ex-mayor of Kimberley were involved in Griquas rugby for 1950–1971.

====Football====
Richard Henyekane, South African footballer, is from Kimberley, his younger brother Joseph played for Golden Arrows. Jimmy Tau is from Kimberley.

==== Swimming ====
Karen Muir, born in Kimberley, became in 1965 the youngest person to break a world record in any sport. This age group record stands to this day. She set it in August 1965 at the junior world champions in Blackpool, England, in the backstroke at the age of 12. She went on to break many more world records but was denied a role in world swimming when she lost the opportunity to represent her country at the 1968 Olympic games in Mexico City as a result of South Africa being excluded for its racial apartheid policies. Kimberley also saw a world record broken in the municipal pool that now bears Muir&#x27;s name. It was Johannesburg&#x27;s Anne Fairlie who beat Karen Muir and Frances Kikki Caron in a time breaking the world record.

Charl Bouwer, the Paralympic swimmer from South Africa who won gold in the 50m freestyle at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, was born in Kimberley.

===Quotations===
&quot;Kimberley has had a profound effect on the course of history in Southern Africa. The discovery of diamonds there, more than a century ago, proved to be the first step in the transformation of South Africa from an agricultural into an industrial country. When gold and other minerals were later discovered to the north, there were already Kimberley men of vision and enterprise with the capital and technology to develop the new resources&quot;. - H.F. Oppenheimer, 1976. Foreword to Brian Roberts&#x27;s book, &quot;Kimberley, Turbulent City&quot;.

Anthony Trollope visited Kimberley in 1877 and was notoriously put off by the heat, enervating and hideous, and the dust and the flies of the early mining town almost drove him mad:
&quot;I sometimes thought that the people of Kimberley were proud of their flies and their dust&quot;.
Of the townscape, largely built of sun-dried brick, and of plank and canvas and corrugated iron sheets brought up by ox-wagon from the coast, he remarked:
&quot;In Kimberley there are two buildings with a storey above the ground, and one of these is in the square: this is its only magnificence. There is no pavement. The roadway is all dust and holes. There is a market place in the midst which certainly is not magnificent. Around are the corrugated iron shops of the ordinary dealers in provisions. An uglier place I do not know how to imagine&quot;.

A.H.J. Bourne, a former headmaster of Kimberley Boys&#x27; High School, returned to the city in 1937, observing that: &quot;The history of Kimberley would appear remarkable to any stranger who could not fail to think that some supermind was behind its destinies. In so short a time it has grown from bare veld&quot;.

In the early 1990s, the writer Dan Jacobson returned to Kimberley, where he had grown up in the 1930s, giving a sense of how things had changed:
&quot;The people I had known had vanished; so had their language. That contributed to my ghostlike state. In my earliest years the whites of Kimberley spoke English only; Afrikaans was the tongue of the Cape Coloured people... Now I was addressed in Afrikaans everywhere I went, by white, black, and Coloured alike&quot;.

&quot;Kimberley dull?&quot; asked the Virtualtourist reviewer Catherine Reichardt. &quot;Happily, the answer is a resounding &#x27;No&#x27;, provided that you have a passion for history - in which case Kimberley has it in spades, and you&#x27;ll probably need to overnight to fully appreciate its attractions and charms. In many ways, exploring Kimberley and its heritage is like experiencing South African history in microcosm&quot;.

===Miscellany===

*The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is an initiative for preventing trade in &quot;conflict diamonds&quot; used to finance the undermining of legitimate governments. It was founded in 2003, following a May 2000 meeting of Southern African diamond-producing states in Kimberley. A tenth anniversary meeting of the Kimberley Process was held at the Mittah Seperepere Convention Centre, Kimberley, on 4--7 June 2013, bringing together representatives of Governments, the diamond industry and civil society. A commemorative event was held at the Kimberley Tabernacle, the venue for the original meeting of the KPCS, where 23 individuals present at the first meeting were honoured for their involvement. South African Minister of Mineral Resources, Susan Shabangu, addressed the closing session, noting the role of the KPCS in minimising &quot;blood diamond&quot; trade, as well as its &quot;significant developmental impact in improving the lives of people dependent on the trade in diamonds&quot;.
*The Kimberley Declaration is a statement, inter alia on respect, promotion and protection of traditional knowledge systems, published by the Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism, on behalf of the &quot;International Indigenous Peoples Summit on Sustainable Development, Khoi-San Territory, Kimberley, South Africa&quot;, 20–23 August 2002

<doc id="313634" wikidata="Q1278351" url="?curid=313634" title="2000 Croatian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Croatia in January 2000, the third since independence in 1991. They were also the first early presidential elections, as they were held due to the death of incumbent president Franjo Tuđman on 10 December 1999, as well as being the last elections held under the semi-presidential system of government, by which the President was the most powerful official in the government structure and could appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and their cabinet.

As no candidate received the required majority (50%+1 vote of the valid votes cast) in the first round on 24 January, a second round was held on 7 February, the first time a second round had been required in the country&#x27;s history. The result was a victory for Stjepan Mesić of the Croatian People&#x27;s Party, who received 56% of the vote. Voter turnout was 63% in the first round and 61% in the second round.

Mesić was inaugurated for a five-year term as the second president of Croatia on 18 February 2000 at St Mark&#x27;s Square in front of the justices of the Constitutional Court.

<doc id="313635" wikidata="Q209537" url="?curid=313635" title="East London, South Africa">
<text>East London (; ) is a city on the southeastern coast of South Africa, in the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, Eastern Cape Province. The city lies on the Indian Ocean coast, largely between the Buffalo River and the Nahoon River, and hosts the country&#x27;s only river port. , East London had a population of over 267,000 with over 755,000 in the surrounding metropolitan area.

== History ==
===Early history===
John Bailie, one of the 1820 Settlers, surveyed the Buffalo River mouth and founded the town in 1836. There is a memorial on Signal Hill commemorating the event.
The city formed around the only river port in South Africa and was originally known as Port Rex. Later it was renamed London in honour of the capital city of the United Kingdom, hence the name East London. This settlement on the West Bank was the nucleus of the town of East London, which was elevated to city status in 1914.

During the early to mid-19th century frontier wars between the British settlers and the local Xhosa inhabitants, East London served as a supply port to service the military headquarters at nearby King William&#x27;s Town, about away. A British fort, Fort Glamorgan, was built on the West Bank in 1847, and annexed to the Cape Colony that same year. This fort is one of a series of British-built forts, including Fort Murray, Fort White, Fort Cox, Fort Hare, Fort Jackson and Fort Beaufort, in the border area that became known as British Kaffraria.

With later development of the port came the settlement of permanent residents, including German settlers, most of whom were bachelors. These settlers were responsible for German names of some towns in the vicinity of East London such as Stutterheim and Berlin. Today, German surnames such as Gehring, Salzwedel and Peinke are still common in East London, but the descendants of the settlers rapidly became Anglicised.

The existing port, in the mouth of the Buffalo River, adjoining the Indian Ocean, began operating in 1870. In 1872, the Cape Colony, under the leadership of its first Prime Minister John Molteno, attained a degree of independence from Britain. The new government merged the three neighbouring settlements of East London, East London East and Panmure in 1873, forming the core of the current municipality, and in 1876 it began construction on the region&#x27;s railway lines, commencing on the river&#x27;s east bank. At the same time, it began construction of the East London harbour. This new infrastructure rapidly accelerated development of the area into today&#x27;s thriving city of East London.

The unusual double-decker bridge over the Buffalo River was completed in 1935, and to this day is the only bridge of its type in South Africa. Modern day attractions include the Gately House, City Hall, Cape Railways, Nahoon Museum, East London Museum housing the coelacanth, a prehistoric fish, thought to be extinct, discovered live at the Chalumna River mouth near East London by fishermen in 1938, and numerous memorial statues.

=== Apartheid era ===

In 1948, the National Party came to power in South Africa, and began to implement the policy of apartheid. Apartheid as a doctrine envisaged the total segregation of races in South Africa, and East London was no different. In 1950, the Group Areas Act was placed upon the statute books making absolute segregation in all urban areas mandatory. In 1951, the Land Tenure Advisory Board, the body created to enforce the act, conducted initial investigations into the reallocation of space along racial lines in East London. Residential segregation had long been practised in East London prior to the advent of apartheid. In 1941, the East London Municipality moved residents from East Bank townships to the newly built township of Duncan Village.

In 1951, all inter-racial property exchanges were prohibited in East London. In 1955, the Amalinda area was zoned as a White Group Area by Government Gazette Proclamation number 21. This meant that the municipality&#x27;s plans to extend the area in order to accommodate the Black African population were abandoned. In 1953, residents in the East Bank were forcibly moved to the new township of Mdantsane. In February 1966, the South African government defined Mdantsane as a separate homeland township. In 1956, Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, who was the architect of apartheid, forbade the East London municipality from extending the existing Duncan Village township and sanctioned the building of Mdantsane.

In 1961, these plans provided for the allocation of a distinct wedge of the city for Asian and Coloured residence, which &quot;incorporated the areas of North End and the recently proclaimed Buffalo Flats location. This plan occasioned tremendous resentment in the city prompting petitions and letters of complaint from numerous organisations including the Black Sash, trade unions and various Black community groups. In 1967, the East London Municipality proclaimed the majority of the city an area for White occupancy, with the exception of a broad sector of land encompassing the Parkside, Parkridge and Buffalo Flats areas which was zoned for Coloured residence. Certain parts of Duncan Village were abolished and its African residents removed, new coloured and Asian locations were built and proclaimed upon land in 1973. In the same year, the newly constructed location of Braelynn was proclaimed an Indian area while Buffalo Flats Extension and Pefferville were proclaimed as Coloured areas. The construction/ extension of Coloured areas and the Duncan Village were suspended in 1983.

===Post-apartheid===
At the end of apartheid in 1994, East London became part of the province of Eastern Cape. In 2000, East London became part of Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, also consisting of King William&#x27;s Town, Bhisho and Mdantsane and is the seat of the Metro.

== Geography and climate ==
East London has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with the warm temperatures and moderation typical of the South African coastline. Although it has no true dry season, there is a drying trend in the winter, with the wettest times of year being spring and autumn. There is also a shorter and lesser dry period in December and January.

The all-time record low is , and the all-time record high is on 13 March 2021. The hottest temperatures have been recorded in springtime and autumn, rather than the summer months, due to violent berg (foehn) winds. Temperatures above have only been recorded early in the season, from August to December. Berg winds contribute to these high temperatures, as already warm air from the arid interior is further heated through compression as it drops over the escarpment to sea level. Although temperatures have never dropped below freezing since records began, East London has recorded snowfall in 1985 and 1989.
== Demographics ==
East London is the second-largest city in the Eastern Cape with a population of 474,000 as of 2016. English is the first spoken language in the city and Xhosa is the second language spoken.



== Economy ==
East London is the second largest industrial centre in the province. The motor industry is the dominant employer. A major Daimler plant is located next to the harbour, manufacturing Mercedes-Benz and other vehicles for the local market, as well as exporting to the United States and Brazil. Other industries include clothing, textiles, pharmaceuticals and food processing.

The period of international sanctions that followed in the 1980s damaged the economy of East London&#x27;s harbour. Enormous investment in recent years, by corporations such as Daimler AG, has resulted in the harbour being developed to include a new car terminal.

From the 1960s until the 1990s, the apartheid government created tax and wage incentives to attract industries to the then black &quot;independent states&quot;, including nearby Ciskei. Investment thus flowed into surrounding areas such as Fort Jackson and Dimbaza, leaving East London in relative isolation. Transport infrastructure deteriorated and port activity wound down.

To encourage investment in East London, the East London Industrial Development Zone (IDZ) was established on the West Bank in 2004, close to both the port and airport. 1500ha of land has been made available, and the site is one of four duty-free development areas in South Africa.

== Sports ==

Cricket is popular around East London. A combined Border/Eastern Province cricket side known as the Warriors take part in the top provincial competition. Former Proteas wicketkeeper Mark Boucher who as of July 2023 holds the Test record for most dismissals by a wicketkeeper hails from East London. Buffalo Park Stadium in East London hosted a match during the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2003 and two matches of the 2009 Indian Premier League.

The Buffalo Road Running Club of East London has created two established events that have gained international recognition. They are the Old Mutual Buffalo 42,2 km marathon, which is held in February/March each year, and South Africa&#x27;s oldest 160 km extreme ultra marathon, the Washie, over a picturesque and undulating coastal route from Port Alfred to the city.

Triathlon is a popular sport and in particular hosted the a world-famous Ironman 70.3 South African event which took place annually in January from 2012 to 2021. Ironman 70.3 events follow a race format which consists of a 1.9 km swim, 90 km of cycling and a 21.1 km road run. The event started and finished at the Orient Beach in East London. In November 2021, the Buffalo City Ironman 70.3 event was cancelled in favour of the new Mossel Bay Ironman 70.3 event.

Rugby is popular in East London. The provincial team, the Border Bulldogs, currently plays in the First Division of the Currie Cup competition. Most national games in East London are played at the Buffalo City Stadium, which holds around 15000 people and was a host stadium during the 1995 Rugby World Cup. East London schools have produced many fine rugby players, including (in recent times) André Vos, Keith and Mark Andrews, Christiaan Scholtz, Brent Russell, Rory Kockott, Akona Ndungane and Odwa Ndungane.

Football is also very popular in the city. East London was home to the Blackburn Rovers, prior to its sudden dissolution in 2014.

Motocross is also popular and many national events are held in the area surrounding East London, due to the challenging terrain there and in Transkei. East London is home to the ELMCC (East London Motor Cycle Club), which organises most of the motorcycle events in the area.

East London is home to the Prince George Race Circuit, opened in 1959 (renamed East London Grand Prix Circuit), a historic motor racing track that hosted three Formula One South African Grand Prix during the 1930s and 1960s. The circuit is run and managed by Border Motor Sport Club on a shoestring budget. South Africa&#x27;s only Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champion, Jody Scheckter, started his motor racing career with a Renault Gordini on this track.

Golf is another favoured pastime in and around East London. East London Golf Club is a highly regarded championship golf course. Some of the other golf clubs in the region are the West Bank Golf Club, Gonubie Golf Club, Olivewood Golf Estate and Fish River Sun Country Club (a Gary Player-designed golf course). East London has also hosted the Africa Open tournament multiple times. Golfers can also hone their skills at the East London Golf Club Driving Range.

Rowing is on the Buffalo River. The annual Buffalo Regatta began in 1881 and has become the largest in South Africa: in 2018 there were 1000 competitors participating in 200 events over three days.

Surfski is ideally suited to East London. The Port Elizabeth to East London Challenge organized by East London&#x27;s Border Canoe club is 244 km long, often in extremely challenging conditions, takes place every second year, attracting competitors from around the world. It began in 1972 to see who was faster, ultra-distance runner John Ball over land, or surf lifesaver John Woods over water. John Ball won.
Surfing is popular in East London. It is home to some of South Africa&#x27;s top surfers, including Greg Emslie, former World Championship Tour surfer, ISA World Masters Champion, five-time South African Men’s Champion and coach to Olympic silver medalist Bianca Buitendag, Andre Malherbe, and up-and-comer Zoe Steyn.

== Transport ==
East London is serviced by two national roads: the coastal N2 highway connects it to Qonce, Makhanda, Gqeberha and Cape Town to the west and Mthatha and Durban to the east. It is the southern end of the N6, which runs north via Komani and Aliwal North to Bloemfontein. Older sections of the N2 have been renumbered the R102. The R72 is an alternative route to Port Elizabeth, via Port Alfred. The R346 is an alternative route to King William&#x27;s Town. East London, like South Africa&#x27;s other major cities, uses Metropolitan (or M) routes as a third tier for its major intra-city roads.

East London railway station offers long-distance passenger services to Cape Town and Johannesburg via Springfontein, and local services.

King Phalo Airport is a commercial airport with service to other large South African metropolitan areas.

==Coat of arms==
The East London municipality assumed a coat of arms on 29 August 1892. The arms were : &quot;Argent, a cross Gules between in the first and fourth quarters a garb and in the second and third quarters a fleece Or; on a chief Azure a demi-sun Or.&quot; A golden anchor was placed behind the shield, no doubt to show that the town was a seaport. The motto was &quot;Animo et fide&quot;.

The arms were improved in the 1950s by the town clerk, H.H. Driffield. He changed the shield from silver to ermine, removed the anchor and devised a crest consisting of two crossed anchors and a mural crown. Heraldist Ivan Mitford-Barberton added two buffalo as supporters. The improved design was granted by the College of Arms on 15 December 1959. It was registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in 1960, and at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1967.

<doc id="313637" wikidata="Q250834" url="?curid=313637" title="Álvaro Arzú">
<text>Álvaro Enrique Arzú Irigoyen (; 14 March 1946 – 27 April 2018) was a Guatemalan politician and businessman who served as the 44th president of Guatemala from 14 January 1996 to 14 January 2000. He was elected Mayor of Guatemala City on six occasions: in 1982, when he declined to take office because of a coup d&#x27;état; in 1986; in 2003, after serving as president; in 2007; in 2011 and 2015, for a term that would see him die in office.

==Early career==
Born in Guatemala City, Arzú studied Social and Legal Sciences at Rafael Landívar University. In 1978 he became director of the Guatemalan Institute of Tourism (INGUAT); he occupied this position until 1981 when he was elected mayor of Guatemala City for the Guatemalan Christian Democracy (DCG) party. But in 1982 there was a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and, although the elections were annulled, the military offered him to be the municipal intendent, which he declined. In 1986 he became mayor, after winning the election under the umbrella of the Plan for National Advancement civic committee.

In 1989, the civic committee became the National Advancement Party (PAN). Arzú was their presidential candidate for the 1990 elections, finishing in fourth place with 17.3 percent of the vote. The winner, Jorge Serrano, appointed Arzú as minister for foreign affairs in 1991. However, he resigned later that year in protest against Serrano&#x27;s decision to normalize relations with Belize, over most of whose territory Guatemala has long-standing claims.

==Presidency ==
Arzú won the first round of the 1995 general elections in November and then narrowly beat Alfonso Portillo of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG, &quot;Frente Republicano Guatemalteco&quot;) in the second round, which took place in January 1996. He obtained 51.2 percent of the vote.

The main achievement of Arzú&#x27;s presidency was the signature of a peace accord with the guerrilla group Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, which ended Guatemala&#x27;s 36-year-long civil war. The negotiations had been going on since 1990, and Arzú gave them a vital new impulse when he met the URNG in Mexico on 26 February 1996. A ceasefire followed on 20 March and various peace agreements were signed as the year progressed. On 12 December an accord legalizing the URNG was signed in Madrid. On 18 December Congress passed a law giving a partial amnesty to the combatants, before the final accord for a firm and lasting peace was signed on 29 December.

As part of this peace accord, Arzú&#x27;s government proposed a series of reforms to the Constitution of Guatemala, including disbanding the Presidential Guard, reducing the armed forces, and recognizing the rights of indigenous communities. However, a 1999 referendum would reject the proposed reforms.

Under Arzú&#x27;s presidency, there was a significant investment in the country&#x27;s infrastructure; particularly, the roads were improved, and electric and telephone coverage was increased. As part of this process, several public transportation and utility companies were privatized, which drew heavy criticism due to accusations of irregularities during the process. Some of these companies were the electric utility &quot;Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala&quot; (EEGSA), the telephone service provider GUATEL, the national airline Aviateca, and the railway company FEGUA.

Among other challenges faced by Arzú&#x27;s government was the murder of Archbishop Juan José Gerardi in 1998, which was later attributed to members of the Presidential Guard. Also, the destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch that same year and the increase in the crime rate. Despite this, the gross domestic product grew about 3 percent annually, and inflation was reduced to 5 percent.

Officers close to his government carried out assassinations of activists of social organizations.

==Later career and death==

After his presidential term, Arzú became a member of the Central American Parliament; he occupied this seat from 2000 to 2004. He was elected for a second term as mayor of Guatemala City in 2003 and was elected again in 2007, 2011, and 2015. His last term was set to finish in 2020.

During this period, Arzú established the &quot;Transmetro&quot; bus rapid transit system and worked on restoring the historical center of Guatemala City.

In his final years, 2017 and 2018, Arzú crusaded against the United Nations Commissioner of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), Iván Velásquez, and against the Attorney General, Thelma Aldana, openly accusing them of carrying out a slow coup d&#x27;état against President Morales under the cover of a fight against corruption and impunity. In the meantime, he had come under fire himself. On 27 April 2018, Arzú had a heart attack while playing golf in Guatemala City. He died in hospital later that day.

==Personal life==
Arzú had three children with his first wife, Sylvia García Granados, and two children with his second wife, Patricia Escobar. His son, Álvaro Arzú Escobar, was president of the Congress of Guatemala.

He was Guatemala&#x27;s national squash rackets champion on several occasions.

==Awards==
* 1996: UNESCO&#x27;s Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize
* 1997: During his presidency, the government of Guatemala was awarded Spain&#x27;s Prince of Asturias Award for International Co-operation.
* Monseñor Leonidas Proaño Human Rights Prize (ALDHU)
* 2005: Ranked third in the World Mayor contest.

<doc id="313642" wikidata="Q209533" url="?curid=313642" title="Bhisho">
<text>Bhisho, formerly Bisho, is the capital of the Eastern Cape province in South Africa. The Office of the Premier, Provincial Legislature and many other government departments are headquartered in the town. The town, three kilometres from Qonce and 70 kilometres from East London, is also part of Buffalo City.

==History==
Bhisho derives its name from the Xhosa word for buffalo, which is also the name of the river (Buffalo River) that runs through this town. Bhisho was named after the song by Ben Tyazashe, who wrote of his longing for his home, Bisho, his name for King William&#x27;s Town however, it has also been claimed that the name was invented by Ciskei leader Lennox Sebe, after his unsuccessful bid to incorporate King William&#x27;s Town into Ciskei, as &quot;Qonce&quot; (the Xhosa version of the Khoikhoi name for the Buffalo River; it means “buffalo”) was already used as the native name for King William&#x27;s Town.

===Capital of Ciskei===

When the bantustan of Ciskei was nominally granted independence in 1981, although this was never recognised outside South Africa, Bisho served as its capital city. During the early 1980s under the leadership of Lennox Sebe, Bisho underwent a period of intense development.

Its location six kilometres north of King William&#x27;s Town on the main road linking the Cape to the Transkei and Natal has been described as the result of the Ciskei government wanting to place an &quot;economic stranglehold&quot; upon the white community of King William&#x27;s Town who united across political lines against incorporation into the homeland, in the face of a 1979 recommendation by the South African government.

In 1983, at the height Ciskei government, Bisho signed a sister-city agreement with the settlement of Ariel in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. This saw the construction of two hospitals (one on a floodplain) including Bisho Hospital and up to 10 firms around the capital by Israeli entrepreneurs and technicians. In 1985, when Bisho ended its relationship with the West Bank, there were 200 Israelis in the Ciskei.

===Bisho Massacre===

On 7 September 1992, Bisho became the scene of what is known as the Bisho massacre, when about 80–100,000 people marched on Bisho calling for the dismantling of Ciskei, which still maintained a measure of independence, and removal of the homeland&#x27;s leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. The Ciskei Defence Force opened fire, shooting dead 28 or 29 people, and wounding 100. The massacre came at a critical time when negotiations towards democracy were underway.

===Post-Apartheid Era===
Bisho was reincorporated into South Africa on 12 August 1994, following the first democratic elections in the country in April the same year. In October 1994, the then Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba announced that Bisho had been selected as the capital city of the Eastern Cape due to its infrastructure, accessibility to major roads and space for further development.

The department of Arts and Culture published a correction of spelling of Bisho to Bhisho in their government notice No. 830 of Gazette No. 26552 on 16 July 2004.

==Bhisho today==

Bhisho&#x27;s major structures include the Eastern Cape government offices (including office of the Premier), a branch of the University of Fort Hare, Bhisho Hospital, Bisho massacre Memorial, Bhisho Stadium and an SABC radio station known as trufm. Bhisho is dependent on the nearby King Williams Town and East London. The majority of the town&#x27;s population who are employed are public service workers. 
The town of Bhisho is surrounded by residential areas; Bhisho Central, Tyutyu North, Bhisho Gardens, Tyutyu Location/Central, Balasi and Amatola View.Schools being Bisho High School, Bisho Primary School, Sinako Primary School, Zameka High School and Tyutyu Primary School

== Climate ==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Bhisho&#x27;s climate as cool semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;), although it borders closely on both a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) and a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

<doc id="313644" wikidata="Q1049450" url="?curid=313644" title="Castle Menzies">
<text>Castle Menzies in Scotland is the ancestral seat of the Clan Menzies and the Menzies Baronets. It is located a little to the west of the small village of Weem, near Aberfeldy in the Highlands of Perthshire, close to the former site of Weem Castle, destroyed c. 1502.

==History==
The sixteenth-century castle, built as a Z-plan castle, was the seat of the chiefs of clan Menzies for over 500 years. Strategically situated, it was involved in the turbulent history of the highlands.

A marriage stone above the original entrance was installed by James Menzies in 1371, to record his marriage to Barbara Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Atholl and Jean Forbes.

In 1598 John Dow MacWilliam &quot;alias&quot; MacGregor broke into the castle to rescue a thief Donald Menzies from the dungeons. The owner, Alexander Menzies of Weem complained that John Murray of Tullibardine had then welcomed Donald Menzies and MacGregor as his household men and servants.

Bonnie Prince Charlie, the Stuart pretender to the throne, rested for two nights in the castle on his way to the battle of Culloden in 1746.

In 1840 an entirely new wing was added, designed by William Burn using stone from the same quarry on south side of Loch Tay.

Duleep Singh, last maharajah of the Sikh Empire, lived at Castle Menzies between 1855 and 1858, following his exile from the Punjab in 1854. He was officially the ward of Sir John Spencer Login and Lady Login, who leased the castle for him.

Sir Robert Menzies, 7th Baronet inherited the estate in 1844. On Sunday 21 April 1878 around 7pm a fire broke out in the roof of the castle. It was spotted by a man passing along the road who raised the alarm. Sir Robert and Lady Menzies were away at Farleyer, but word was sent and they returned immediately. Local efforts managed to keep the fire under control, and by 10pm when the fire engine from Taymouth Castle arrived, the fire was nearly extinguished. The excitement was thought to have affected the health of Lady Menzies, and she died the following month.

Sir Neil Menzies, 8th Baronet, inherited the estate in 1903 but died without heirs in 1910. In 1913 the house contents were auctioned and in 1914 the papers were sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for £1,160. £300 was paid for a letter of Mary Queen of Scots to the Laird of Weym dated Drymmen, in Menteith, 31 August 1566 and relating to the Macgregors of Rannoch. The &quot;Proposals&quot; signed by Charles I at Holmby, 12 May 1647, for resigning the command of the Militia for ten years, and agreeing to the Establishment of Presbyterianism for three years, fetched £56.

The castle and 11,600 acres of estate land finally sold in 1918 for £69,000 () to Francis Willey, later Baron Barnby. On his death, his widow put the estate up for sale in April 1930.

==Menzies Clan Society==

The restoration of the ancient part of the castle involved the demolition of a greatly decayed 18th century wing. A large Victorian ballroom (not visible in the adjacent photograph) was, however, retained.
The castle, restored by the Menzies Clan Society after 1957, is an example of architectural transition between an earlier tradition of rugged fortresses and a later one of lightly defensible &#x27;châteaux&#x27;. The walls are of random rubble, originally harled (roughcast), but the quoins, turrets and door and window surrounds are of finely carved blue freestone. This attractive and extremely hard-weathering stone was also used for the architectural details and monuments at the nearby Old Kirk of Weem, which was built by the Menzies family and contains their monuments and funeral hatchments.

The castle was designated as a Category A listed building in 1971 and the grounds were added to the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland in 1987.

Restoration work started in earnest in 1972 with a £40,000 project partly funded by at £10,000 grant from the Historical Buildings Council. This work took nearly 10 years under the leadership of Dr Bill Dewar MBE and allowed the building to open to the public.

A further grant of £135,900 was awarded in 1991 to help with the £230,000 final phase of restoration of the Victorian west wing and the creation of the ballroom &quot;The Dewar Room&quot;.

The Menzies Charitable Trust was established in 1994 to look after the castle, the walled garden and St Cuthbert&#x27;s Old Kirk of Weem.

A historic lifting stone sits in front of the castle. It is known as The Chieftains Stone or Menzies Stone. This is open to lifters and weighs 115 kg. This is not one of the heavier stones, however, it presents a challenge even to seasoned lifters due to its extremely round shape and smooth texture.

<text>The Eastern Cape (; ) is one of the nine provinces of South Africa. Its capital is Bhisho, and its largest city is Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth). Due to its climate and nineteenth-century towns, it is a common location for tourists. It is also known for having been home to many anti-apartheid activists, including Nelson Mandela.

The second largest province in the country (at 168,966 km2) after the Northern Cape, it was formed in 1994 out of the Xhosa homelands or bantustans of Transkei and Ciskei, together with the eastern portion of the Cape Province. The central and eastern part of the province is the traditional home of the indigenous Xhosa people. In 1820 this area, which was known as the Xhosa Kingdom, began to be settled by Europeans who originally came from England, Scotland and Ireland.

==History==
The Eastern Cape province was formed in 1994, incorporating areas from the former Xhosa homelands of the Transkei and Ciskei, together with what was previously part of the Cape Province. This resulted in several anomalies, including the fact that the Province has four supreme courts (in Makhanda (formerly named Grahamstown), Gqeberha (formerly named Port Elizabeth), Bhisho and Mthatha, and had enclaves of KwaZulu-Natal in the province. The latter anomaly has fallen away with amendments to municipal and provincial boundaries.

The Xhosa Kingdom was one of the most powerful kingdoms in Africa, and had all states in the Eastern Cape as tributaries. Any group, people, or tribe that recognised the Xhosa Kingdom as Paramouncy became Xhosa, practiced Xhosa culture and used isiXhosa as their main language. Some of the tribes that fall under the category of Xhosa people include: AmaMpondo, AbaThembu, AmaMpondomise, AmaHlubi, AmaBhaca, AmaXesibe, AmaBomvana and more.

===European settlers===

In the late 18th century the Dutch Cape Colony slowly expanded eastwards from its original centre around Cape Town. This led to the establishment in 1786 of the Dutch settlement of Graaff-Reinet – named for the Governor of the Cape Colony Cornelius Jacob van de Graaff (in office: 1785–1791) and for his wife Hester Cornelia van de Graaff (née Reynet). Later, during the Napoleonic wars of 1803–1815, Britain took control of the Cape Colony (1806) and encouraged British citizens to migrate there as a means to boost the British population in the area.

From the early 1800s until the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the Eastern Cape saw colonisation by British migrants. English settlers established most of the towns, naming them either for places in England or for the original founders. British colonization saw schools, churches, hospitals, town centres and government buildings built to speed up development. Some of the older European settlements include Fort Beaufort (1814), Grahamstown (1812), Port Elizabeth (1820), Salem (1820), Bathurst (1820), East London (1836), Paterson (1879), Cradock (1814), Fort Beaufort (1816) and King William&#x27;s Town (1836).

== Geography ==

The Eastern Cape gets progressively wetter from west to east. The west is mostly semiarid Karoo, except in the far south, which is temperate rainforest in the Tsitsikamma region. The coast is generally rugged with interspersed beaches. Most of the province is hilly to very mountainous between Graaff-Reinet and Rhodes including the Sneeuberge (English: Snow Mountains), Stormberge, Winterberge and Drakensberg (English: Dragon Mountains). The highest point in the province is Ben Macdhui at 3001 m. The east from East London and Queenstown towards the KwaZulu-Natal border – a region known previously as Transkei – is lush grassland on rolling hills, punctuated by deep gorges with intermittent forest.

Eastern Cape has a coast on its east which lines southward, creating shores leading to the south Indian Ocean. In the northeast, it borders the following districts of Lesotho:
*Mohale&#x27;s Hoek District – west of Quthing
*Quthing District – between Mohale and Qacha&#x27;s Nek
*Qacha&#x27;s Nek District – east of Quthing

Domestically, it borders the following provinces:
*Western Cape – west
*Northern Cape – northwest
*Free State – north
*KwaZulu-Natal – far northeast

=== Climate ===
Climate is highly varied. The west is dry with sparse rain during winter or summer, with frosty winters and hot summers. The area Tsitsikamma to Grahamstown receives more precipitation, which is also relatively evenly distributed and temperatures are mild. Further east, rainfall becomes more plentiful and humidity increases, becoming more subtropical along the coast with summer rainfall. The interior can become very cold in winter, with heavy snowfalls occasionally occurring in the mountainous regions between Molteno and Rhodes.
*Gqeberha: Jan Max: 25 °C, Min: 18 °C; Jul Max: 20 °C, Min: 9 °C
*Molteno &amp; Barkly East: Jan Max 28 °C, Min 11 °C; Jul Max: 14 °C, Min: -7 °C

== Municipalities ==
The Eastern Cape Province is divided into two metropolitan municipalities and six district municipalities. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 27 local municipalities.

Major cities and towns include the following (in the case of places that have been renamed, the traditional name is listed first followed by the new official name):

== Demographics ==
As of the 2022 census, the Eastern Cape had a population of 7,230,204, an increase of 10.2% from the prior census in 2011. It is the fourth-most populous of South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces. The median age is 27, an increase of 5 years from 2011.

=== Race/Ethnicity ===
In the 2022 census, 85.7% of the population described themselves as Black African, 7.6% as Coloured, 5.6% as White and 0.5% as Indian/Asian. A large majority of Black African people in the province are Xhosa, with 78.8% of residents in Eastern Cape identifying as Xhosa as of 2011. Unlike most of South Africa, a substantial proportion of the White population is of British descent. Roughly half of White South Africans in Eastern Cape are English-speakers of British descent while the other half are of Boer/Afrikaner ancestry. Eastern Cape is one of only two provinces in South Africa where Whites of British descent outnumber Boers/Afrikaners, the other being KwaZulu-Natal. 
=== Languages ===
In the 2022 census, 81.8% of the population reported their first language as Xhosa, 9.6% as Afrikaans, 4.8% as English, and 2.4% as Sotho. The Eastern Cape is the only province in which native Xhosa-speakers form a majority of the population.

=== Religion ===
As of the 2022 census, 86.1% of the population described themselves as Christians, 11.0% stated that they practiced Traditional African religions, and 0.6% described themselves as Muslim. 1.5% of the population described themselves as being atheist, agnostic, or having no religious affiliation.

== Economy ==
The Eastern Cape is the poorest province in South Africa and has the highest expanded and official unemployment rate in the country. Subsistence agriculture predominates in the former homelands, resulting in widespread poverty. A multi billion Rand industrial development zone and deep water port are being developed in Coega to boost investment in export-oriented industries. Overall the province only contributes 8% to the national GDP despite making 13.5% of the population. The real GDP of Eastern Cape stands at an estimated R230.3billion in 2017, making the province the fourth largest regional economy in SA ahead of Limpopo and Mpumalanga.

===Agriculture===
There is much fertile land in the Eastern Cape, and agriculture remains important. The fertile Langkloof Valley in the southwest has large deciduous fruit orchards. In the Karoo there is widespread sheep farming.

The Alexandria-Makhanda area produces pineapples, chicory and dairy products, while coffee and tea are cultivated at Magwa. People in the former Transkei region are dependent on cattle, maize and sorghum-farming. An olive nursery has been developed in collaboration with the University of Fort Hare to form a nucleus of olive production in the Eastern Cape.

Domestic stock farming is slowly giving way to game farming on large scale. Eco-tourism is resulting in economic benefits, and there is lower risk needed to protect wild, native game against drought, and the natural elements. Habitat loss and poaching pose the greatest problems.

The area around Stutterheim is being cultivated extensively with timber plantations.

The basis of the province&#x27;s fishing industry is squid, some recreational and commercial fishing for line fish, the collection of marine resources, and access to line-catches of hake.

===Industry===
With three import/export harbours and three airports offering direct flights to the main centres, and an excellent road and rail infrastructure, the province has been earmarked as a key area for growth and economic development in modern South Africa.

The two major industrial centres, Port Elizabeth and East London have well-developed economies based on the automotive industry. General Motors and Volkswagen both have major assembly lines in the Port Elizabeth area, while East London is dominated by the large DaimlerChrysler plant, now known as Mercedes-Benz South Africa.

Environmental-friendly projects include the Fish River Spatial Development Initiative, the Wild Coast SDI, and two industrial development zones, the East London Industrial Development Zone and the Coega IDZ near Port Elizabeth. Coega is the largest infrastructure development in post-apartheid South Africa. The construction of the deepwater Port of Ngqura was completed and the first commercial ship anchored in October 2009.

Other sectors include finance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, eco-tourism (nature reserves and game ranches) and hotels and restaurants.

==Law and government==
The Eastern Cape provincial government is based in Bhisho, the provincial capital. The Eastern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa is situated in Makhanda (Grahamstown), with local seats in Gqhebera (Port Elizabeth), East London, and Bhisho.

Like South Africa&#x27;s other provinces, the Eastern Cape has a parliamentary system of government, with the premier of the province elected by the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature. The premier then selects the members of the Executive Council (cabinet). The current premier is Oscar Mabuyane of the African National Congress (ANC).

The provincial legislature is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation. The most recent provincial election was held in 2024, which was won by the ANC, which has governed the province continuously since the end of Apartheid in 1994. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is the second largest party and forms the official opposition. The results of the most recent provincial election in 2024 are as follows:

== Education ==

The Eastern Cape Department of Education has been criticised for poor primary and secondary education resulting from dysfunction, special interests, and issues with the South Africa teachers union, SADTU. The province struggles with a lack of schools; a lack of teachers leading to overcrowding; a lack of textbooks; a lack of basic facilities like toilets, electricity or water; and poor transport infrastructure which regularly absents and endangers learners. The problem is particularly acute in the former Transkei.

By 2011, basic education had so deteriorated that the national Department of Basic Education intervened under section 100(1)(b) of the Constitution of South Africa, taking control of the province&#x27;s educational administration. The Eastern Cape has since been the worst-performing province educationally and especially in terms of matriculation; matriculants&#x27; results averaged 51% in 2009, 58.3% in 2011, 64.9% in 2013, 65.4% in 2014, and 56.8% in 2015.

In the 2015/2016 financial year, the province failed to spend R 530 million of its allocated R 1.5 billion budget for education, most of it intended for infrastructure development.

Equal Education&#x27;s 2017 report, Planning to Fail, found a &quot;systemic failure in Eastern Cape education&quot;.

=== Universities ===
*Rhodes University (Makhanda)
*Nelson Mandela University (Gqeberha)
*University of Fort Hare (main campus in Alice, satellite campuses in Bhisho and East London)
*Walter Sisulu University (campuses in Buffalo City, Butterworth, Mthatha and Komani)

=== Other educational institutions ===
*College of the Transfiguration, Makhanda

== Health ==
The province is served by big medical centres such as Cecilia Makiwane Hospital which is a large, government-funded hospital near the city of East London that also serves as a tertiary teaching hospital. Frere Hospital is another large, provincial government-funded hospital near East London which also serves as a tertiary teaching hospital. These hospitals offer many specialty departments such as an ARV clinic for HIV/AIDS in adults and children. Both hospitals are affiliated with Lilitha Nursing College and Walter Sisulu University.

While the Eastern Cape has many hospitals and private clinics, the province has some of the worst health outcomes and service indicators in South Africa. Some of this can be attributed to staff shortages, with a report indicating that 67% of the 27 monitored facilities have insufficient staff.

Rural residents in the Eastern Cape face worse health outcomes than those who reside in the larger towns or cities. This is due to a number of conditions such as lack of healthcare resources, lack of means to access healthcare resources, high unemployment, and poverty. Illiteracy is also a problem in rural communities, which further limits positive health outcomes.

HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis are also ongoing issues in the region. In 2017, the Eastern Cape had a TB incidence of 839/100,000 people, which was higher than South Africa&#x27;s estimated prevalence of 737/100,000. Additionally, the Eastern Cape has a high overall HIV prevalence rate (25.2%) as of 2017. In 2018, HIV/AIDS was the second leading underlying natural cause of death in the Eastern Cape with a 5.9% prevalence rate. Since 2017, there has been an increase in the level of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which disproportionately affects poorer communities. Furthermore, obesity and undiagnosed hypertension are major concerns in rural areas.

The Eastern Cape is also known for its traditional Xhosa initiation schools, which perform coming-of-age ceremonies known as ulwaluko which involve circumcision. These ceremonies have been linked to numerous complications such as coma, illness and death.

There have been numerous reports in South African newspapers investigating the poor practices which lead to the death of young men and boys during initiation rituals. In one case, an 18-year-old teenager named Yongama Boya was sent to the hospital to be circumcised, as his parents believed this would be the safer option. Then, he was sent to complete the rest of his initiation ritual in a traditional initiation school in the Qumbu area of the Transkei. There, the nurse refused to accept the validity of his prior circumcision at the hospital, and she circumcised him again, resulting in his death.

== Tourism ==

The landscape is extremely diverse. The western interior is largely arid Karoo, while the east is well-watered and green. The Eastern Cape offers a wide array of attractions, including of untouched and pristine coastline along with beaches, and big-five game viewing in a malaria-free environment.

The Addo Elephant National Park, situated from Port Elizabeth, was proclaimed in 1931. Its offers sanctuary to 170 elephants, 400 Cape buffalo and 21 black rhino of the very scarce Kenyan sub-species.

The province is the location of Tiffindell, South Africa&#x27;s only snow skiing resort, which is situated near the hamlet of Rhodes in the Southern Drakensberg. It is on the slopes of Ben Macdhui, the highest mountain peak in the Eastern Cape .

The National Arts Festival, held annually in Grahamstown, is Africa&#x27;s largest cultural event, offering a choice of both indigenous and imported talent. Every year for eleven days the town&#x27;s population almost doubles, as over 50,000 people flock to the region for a feast of arts, crafts, music and entertainment.

Jeffreys Bay is an area with wild coastline, which is backed by sub-tropical rainforest. The waters here are noted for having good waves for surfing.

Aliwal North, lying on an agricultural plateau on the southern bank of the Orange River, is an inland resort known for its hot springs.

The rugged and unspoiled Wild Coast is a place of spectacular scenery. The coastal areas have been a graveyard for many vessels.

Whittlesea, Eastern Cape, situated in the Amatola Mountains, is known for the first wine estate in the province.

King William&#x27;s Town, Alice, Queenstown, Grahamstown, Cradock and Fort Beaufort offer some of the best colonial architecture of the 19th century in the province. The two major cities lining the coast are East London and Port Elizabeth.

<text>The Western Cape (; ) is a province of South Africa, situated on the south-western coast of the country. It is the fourth largest of the nine provinces with an area of , and the third most populous, with an estimated 7 million inhabitants in 2020. About two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the metropolitan area of Cape Town, which is also the provincial capital. The Western Cape was created in 1994 from part of the former Cape Province. The two largest cities are Cape Town and George.

== Geography ==

The Western Cape is roughly L-shaped, extending north and east from the Cape of Good Hope, in the southwestern corner of South Africa. It stretches about northwards along the Atlantic coast and about eastwards along the South African south coast (Southern Indian Ocean). It is bordered on the north by the Northern Cape and on the east by the Eastern Cape. The total land area of the province is , about 10.6% of the country&#x27;s total. It is roughly the size of England or the State of Louisiana. Its capital city and largest city is Cape Town, and some other major cities include Stellenbosch, Worcester, Paarl, and George. The Garden Route and the Overberg are popular coastal tourism areas.

The Western Cape is the southernmost region of the African continent with Cape Agulhas as its southernmost point, only from the Antarctic coastline. The coastline varies from sandy between capes, to rocky to steep and mountainous in places. The only natural harbour is Saldanha Bay on the west coast, about north of Cape Town. However a lack of fresh water in the region meant that it has only recently been used as a harbour. The province&#x27;s main harbour was built in Table Bay, which in its natural state was fully exposed to the northwesterly storms that bring rain to the province in winter, as well as the almost uninterrupted dry southeasterly winds in summer. But fresh water coming off Table Mountain and Devil&#x27;s Peak allowed the early European settlers to build Cape Town on the shores of this less than satisfactory anchorage.

=== Topography ===
The province is topographically exceptionally diverse. Most of the province falls within the Cape Fold Belt, a set of nearly parallel ranges of sandstone folded mountains of Cambrian-Ordovician age (the age of the rocks is from 510 to about 330 million years ago; their folding into mountains occurred about 350 to about 270 million years ago). The height of the mountain peaks in the different ranges varies from to . The valleys between ranges are generally very fertile, as they contain the weathered loamy soils of the Bokkeveld mudstones (see the diagrams below).

The far interior forms part of the Karoo. This region of the province is generally arid and hilly, with a prominent escarpment that runs close to the Province&#x27;s most inland boundary.

==== Escarpment ====
The escarpment marks the southwestern edge of South Africa&#x27;s central plateau (see the middle and bottom diagrams on the left). It runs parallel to the entire South African coastline, except in the very far northeast, where it is interrupted by the Limpopo River valley, and in the far northwest, where it is interrupted by the Orange River valley. The northeastern stretch of the escarpment is called the Drakensberg, which is geographically and geologically quite distinct from the Cape Fold Mountains, which originated much earlier and totally independently of the origin of the escarpment.

==== Rivers ====
The principal rivers of the province are the Berg and Olifants which drain into the Atlantic Ocean, and the Breede and Gourits which drain into the Indian Ocean.

=== Flora ===

The vegetation of the region is also extremely diverse, with one of the world&#x27;s six floral kingdoms almost exclusively endemic to the province, namely the Cape Floral Kingdom, most of which is covered by Fynbos (from the Afrikaans meaning &quot;Fine Bush&quot; (Dutch: Fijnbos), though precisely how it came to be referred to as such, is uncertain.). These evergreen heathlands are extremely rich in species diversity, with at least as many plant species occurring on Table Mountain as in the entire United Kingdom. It is characterised by various types of shrubs, thousands of herbaceous flowering plant species and some grasses. With the exception of the Silver tree, &quot;Leucadendron argenteum&quot;, which only grows on the granite and clay soils of the Cape Peninsula, open fynbos is generally treeless except in the wetter mountain ravines where patches of Afromontane forest persist.

The arid interior is dominated by Karoo drought-resistant shrubbery. The West Coast and Little Karoo are semi-arid regions and are typified by many species of succulents and drought-resistant shrubs and acacia trees. The Garden Route on the south coast (between the Outeniqua Mountains and the Southern Indian Ocean) is extremely lush, with temperate rainforest (or Afromontane Forest) covering many areas adjacent to the coast, in the deep river valleys and along the southern slopes of the Outeniqua mountain range. Typical species are hardwoods of exceptional height, such as Yellowwood, Stinkwood and Ironwood trees.

=== Climate ===
The Western Cape is climatologically diverse, with many distinct micro- and macroclimates created by the varied topography and the influence of the surrounding ocean currents. These are the warm Agulhas Current which flows southwards along South Africa&#x27;s east coast, and the cold Benguela Current which is an upwelling current from the depths of the South Atlantic Ocean along South Africa&#x27;s west coast. Thus climatic statistics can vary greatly over short distances. Most of the province is considered to have a Mediterranean climate with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Both the Great Karoo and Little Karoo, in the interior, have an arid to semi-arid climate with cold, frosty winters and hot summers with occasional thunderstorms. The Garden Route and the Overberg on the south coast have a maritime climate with cool, moist winters and mild, moist summers. Mossel Bay in the Garden Route is considered to have the second mildest climate worldwide after Hawaii. The La Niña phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle tends to increase rainfall in this region in the dry season (November to April).

The effects of El Niño on rainfall in southern Africa differ between the summer and winter rainfall areas. Winter rainfall areas tend to get higher rainfall than normal and summer rainfall areas tend to get less rain. The effect on the summer rainfall areas is stronger and has led to severe drought in strong El Niño events.

Sea surface temperatures off the west and south coasts of South Africa are affected by ENSO via changes in surface wind strength. During El Niño the south-easterly winds driving upwelling are weaker which results in warmer coastal waters than normal, while during La Niña the same winds are stronger and cause colder coastal waters. These effects on the winds are part of large scale influences on the tropical Atlantic and the South Atlantic High-pressure system, and changes to the pattern of westerly winds further south. There are other influences not known to be related to ENSO of similar importance. Some ENSO events do not lead to the expected changes.

Thunderstorms are generally rare in the province (except in the Karoo) with most precipitation being of a frontal or orographic nature. Extremes of heat and cold are common inland, but rare near the coast. Snow is a common winter occurrence on the Western Cape Mountains occasionally reaching down into the more inland valleys. Otherwise, frost is relatively rare in coastal areas and many of the heavily cultivated valleys.


==Political history==
=== Cape Liberal Tradition ===
The Cape has had a long tradition of holding liberal values. For example, the Cape Qualified Franchise before the Union of South Africa.

==== Cape Qualified Franchise ====

The Cape Qualified Franchise was the system of non-racial franchise that was adhered to in the Cape Colony, and in the Cape Province in the early years of the Union of South Africa. Qualifications for the right to vote at parliamentary elections were applied equally to all men, regardless of race.

This local system of multi-racial suffrage was later gradually restricted, and eventually abolished, under various National Party and United Party governments. In 1930 white women were enfranchised, and in 1931 property qualifications for white voters were removed. In 1936 black voters were then removed from the common voters&#x27; rolls and allowed only to elect separate members in 1936, and subsequently denied all representation in the House of Assembly in 1960. Coloured voters similarly followed in 1958 and 1970, respectively.

==== Contribution of the Western Cape in the National Youth Uprisings ====
The Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) was a grassroots anti-Apartheid activist movement that emerged in South Africa in the mid-1960s out of the political vacuum created by the jailing and banning of the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress leadership after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960. The BCM represented a social movement for political consciousness.

In December 1968, the South African Student Organization (SASO) was formed at a conference held in Marianhill, Natal. The conference was exclusively attended by Black students. After its launch, SASO became the medium through which black consciousness ideology spread to schools and other university campuses across the country.

In 1974, South African Minister of Bantu Education and Development MC Botha, constituted the imposition of using Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in black schools, effective with students in Grade 7 (Standard 5) upwards. As early as March 1976, students began passive resistance against Afrikaans, fueling the outbreak of the Soweto Uprising on 16 June 1976. Consequently, the student protests spread to other parts of the country, and Cape Town became a pivotal site for Western Cape student revolt.

Student leaders at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and the University of Cape Town (UCT) organised marches. Poster parades by UWC and Black Power Salute marches by UCT was broken by the police, resulting in 73 students getting arrested and detained at Victor Verster Prison, near Paarl.

On 1 September 1976, the unrest spread to the city of Cape Town itself. Approximately 2000 black students from Western Cape townships, namely Langa, Nyanga and Gugulethu, matched the Cape Town central business district (CBD). Coloured students also contributed to the protests by peacefully marching to the city, but were blockaded by the police in the CBD. The protests turned violent when coloured students started burning schools, libraries and a magistrate&#x27;s court in support of the student revolt. Thereafter, 200,000 coloured workers partook in a two-day strike staying away from work in the Cape Town area.

According to a report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the Western Cape experienced the second highest number of deaths and casualties associated with the 1976 uprising protests.

==== 1994 and the Western Cape post-apartheid ====
In 1994, at the introduction of the Interim Constitution and the first non-racial election, South Africa&#x27;s original provinces and bantustans were abolished and nine new provinces were established. The former Cape Province was divided into the Western Cape, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape and part of North West.

In the 1994 election, the Western Cape was one of two provinces that did not elect an African National Congress (ANC) provincial government (the other being KwaZulu-Natal). The National Party (NP) won 53% of the votes and 23 seats in the 42-seat provincial legislature, and Hernus Kriel, a former Minister of Law and Order, was elected Premier. He resigned in 1998 and was replaced by Gerald Morkel.

The 1999 election marked the beginning of a period of great turbulence in Western Cape politics. No party achieved an absolute majority in the provincial parliament, as the ANC won 18 seats while the New National Party (NNP), successor to the NP, won 17. The NNP went into coalition with the Democratic Party (DP), which won 5 seats, to form a government, and Morkel remained Premier. In 2000 the DP and the NNP formalised their coalition by forming the Democratic Alliance (DA).

In 2001, however, the NNP broke with the DA over the removal of Peter Marais from office as Mayor of Cape Town by DA leader Tony Leon. The NNP instead went into coalition with the ANC; Gerald Morkel, who was opposed to the split, resigned as Premier and was replaced by Peter Marais. In 2002 Marais resigned as Premier due to a sexual harassment scandal, and was replaced by NNP leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk. During the 2003 floor-crossing period four members of the provincial parliament crossed to the ANC, giving it an absolute majority of 22 seats in the 42-seat house. However, the ANC remained in coalition with the NNP and van Schalkwyk remained as Premier.

In the 2004 election, there was again no absolute winner in the provincial parliament; this time the ANC won 19 seats, the DA won 12, and the NNP won 5. The ANC-NNP coalition continued in power, but van Schalkwyk took up a ministerial post in the national cabinet and was replaced as Premier by the ANC&#x27;s Ebrahim Rasool. The NNP was finally dissolved after the 2005 floor-crossing period and its members joined the ANC, again giving that party an absolute majority of 24 seats. In the 2007 floor-crossing period the ANC gained a further three members of the provincial parliament. In 2008 Rasool resigned as Premier due to internal party politics, and was replaced by Lynne Brown.

The 2009 election marked a significant change in Western Cape politics, as the Democratic Alliance won 51% of the votes and an absolute majority of 22 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 31% of the vote. The DA leader Helen Zille was elected Premier. In 2010 the Independent Democrats, which had won 3 seats with 5% of the vote, merged with the DA. In the 2014 election the DA won 59% of the votes and an absolute majority of 26 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 32% of the vote. In 2018 King Khoebaha Cornelius III Declared the independence of the &quot;Sovereign State of Good Hope&quot;.

In the 2019 election, the DA retained their majority in the province, but with a reduction in support. It had won 24 seats with 55%. Helen Zille was term-limited and the DA premier candidate Alan Winde succeeded her. The ANC also lost support. It had received 12 seats with 28% support, its lowest showing since 1994. Veteran politician Peter Marais returned to the provincial parliament as the sole representative of the Freedom Front Plus. Patricia de Lille formed another party, Good, and it achieved a seat.

The DA continued to win a majority of the votes in the 2021 municipal elections, receiving 54% of the vote province-wide, with support in Cape Town at 58%.

=== Cape Independence Movement ===

Since the late 2000s there has been growing support for Western Cape, or Greater Cape, independence from South Africa. Political parties such as the Referendum Party, Freedom Front Plus and organisations such as the Cape Independence Advocacy Group and CapeXit, wish to bring forth the constitutional and peaceful secession of the Western Cape.

Proponents claim substantial support for the idea, with CapeXit having over 800,000 signed mandates in May 2021. Additionally, a poll conducted in 2023 by Victory Research on behalf of the Cape Independence Advocacy Group claimed that 58% of the Western Cape&#x27;s registered voters would support independence, while 68% would support a referendum on the issue.

==Law and government==
The provincial government is established under the Constitution of the Western Cape, which was adopted in 1998. The people of the province elect the 42-member Western Cape Provincial Parliament every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation. The sixth provincial parliament was elected in 2024; 24 seats are held by the Democratic Alliance, 8 by the African National Congress, 3 by the Patriotic Alliance, 2 by the Economic Freedom Fighters, and 1 each by the African Christian Democratic Party, Al Jama-ah, Good, Freedom Front Plus, and National Coloured Congress. The provincial parliament is responsible for legislating within its responsibilities as set out by the national constitution; these responsibilities include agriculture, education, environment, health services, housing, language policies, tourism, trade, and welfare.

The provincial parliament also elects the Premier of the Western Cape to lead the provincial executive. Alan Winde, a member of the DA and former Provincial Minister of Community Safety, has served as Premier since the 2019 provincial election. The Premier appoints ten members of the provincial legislature to serve as a cabinet of ministers, overseeing the departments of the provincial government. These departments are Agriculture, Community Safety, Cultural Affairs and Sport, Economic Development and Tourism, Education, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, Health, Human Settlements, Local Government, Social Development, Transport and Public Works, and the Provincial Treasury.

Politically, the Western Cape is a stronghold for the Democratic Alliance (DA). The DA has won an absolute majority of the vote in the province in every national, provincial, and municipal election since 2009.

==Municipalities==

The Western Cape Province is divided into one metropolitan municipality and five district municipalities. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 24 local municipalities.

In the following interactive map, the district and metropolitan municipalities are labelled in capital letters and shaded in various different colours.

==Economy==
As of the third quarter of 2023, the Western Cape&#x27;s total real GDP was R656.27 billion, which equaled 14.2% of South Africa&#x27;s total GDP, and real GDP per capita was R90,571. The Western Cape has the third largest economy of South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces, behind Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. The province&#x27;s unemployment rate was 20.2%, which is the lowest in South Africa and considerably below the national unemployment rate of 31.9%. As of 2018, the Western Cape&#x27;s Human Development Index is the highest in South Africa at 0.741 compared to the South African average of 0.705.

As of 2023, the biggest sector in the Western Cape&#x27;s economy is the financial, business services and real estate sector, which constitutes 33.55% of gross value added, followed by manufacturing at 14.26% and wholesale and retail trade, hotels, and restaurants at 13.67%. High-tech industries, international call centres, fashion design, advertising and TV production are niche industries rapidly gaining in importance.

Cape Town accounts for roughly 73% of the Western Cape&#x27;s GDP.

95% of wine produced in South Africa is produced in the Western Cape. South Africa is the 7th largest wine producing region in the world.

==Transport==
The Western Cape has an excellent network of highways comparable with any first-world country. The primary highways are the N1 (from Cape Town to Three Sisters, continuing outside the province towards Bloemfontein and Johannesburg), N2 (from Cape Town to Bloukrans River, towards Port Elizabeth), N7 (from Cape Town to Bitterfontein, continuing towards Springbok and Namibia), N9 (from George to Uniondale, continuing towards Graaff-Reinet and Colesberg) and N12 (from George to Three Sisters, continuing towards Kimberley and Johannesburg). Other routes are the &quot;R&quot; roads which connect the smaller towns. All major roads are tarred with major rural gravel roads well maintained. Limited access motorways are limited to the Cape Metropolitan Area, Winelands and Garden Route, however due to the low population density of the remainder of the province, the highways remain efficient and high-speed, except during peak holiday travel seasons, when travel can be slow-going in places due to heavy traffic. 

== Demographics ==
The 2022 South African census recorded the population of the Western Cape as 7,433,020 people living in 2,264,032 households. As the province covers an area of , the population density was and the household density .

The age distribution of the province was as follows: 25.1% were under the age of 15, 18.3% from 15 to 24, 32.7% from 25 to 44, 18.0% from 45 to 64, and 5.9% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 28 years. For every 100 women there are 96 men.

In the 2022 Census, 42% of the people of the Western Cape described themselves as &quot;Coloured&quot;, while 39% described themselves as &quot;Black African&quot;, 16% as &quot;White&quot;, and 1% as &quot;Indian or Asian&quot;. Afrikaans is the first language of 41% of the province&#x27;s population, IsiXhosa of 31%, and English of 22%.

There were 260,952 people in the province who had been born outside of South Africa, comprising 4% of the population. In 2011, 894,289 residents of the Western Cape had been born in the Eastern Cape (16% of the population), 167,524 in Gauteng (3%) and 61,945 (1%) in KwaZulu-Natal. Between 2001 and 2007 the Western Cape received the second-most internal migration within South Africa after Gauteng, with a large majority of these new Western Cape residents coming from the former Transkei region of the Eastern Cape, which served as the historic native reserve of the Cape Colony and the political banishment site for native &quot;troublemakers&quot;.

=== Economic status ===
90% of households in the province have a flush toilet and 90% have refuse removed by the local council at least once a week. 75% of households have piped tap water inside the dwelling, while a further 13% have piped water on their property; 11% receive piped water at a community tap, while 1% have no access to piped water. One in seven people live in an informal dwelling. 86.9% of households use electricity for cooking, and 93% use it for lighting. 89% of households have a cellphone and 31% have a landline telephone, while 86% own a television, 81% own a refrigerator, and 34% own a computer. 44% of households have access to the Internet.
The average annual household income was R143,460, the second-highest in the country after Gauteng. , 69% of the population aged 15–64 are economically active, and of these 25% are unemployed. Overall, 52% of the working-age population are employed. Around 2 million people in the Western Cape labour market (those aged 16 to 64) are employed, 1.3 million are not economically active, 552,733 are unemployed with an additional 122,753 who are discouraged work seekers who want to work but have given up looking for it.

=== Education ===
2.7% of residents aged 20 and over have received no schooling, 10.7% have had only some primary, 5.6% have completed primary school but gone no further, 38% have had some secondary education without finishing Grade 12, 28% have finished Grade 12 but gone no further, and 14% have higher education beyond the secondary level. Overall, 43% of residents have completed high school.

===Religion===
According to the 2022 census, a majority of the population of the Western Cape is Christian. At 5.2% of the population, the Western Cape&#x27;s Muslim minority is the largest among South Africa&#x27;s provinces.
===Cities and towns===

==Education==

The Western Cape province has the most highly educated residents with a very skilled workforce in comparison to any other African region. The high school graduation rate is consistently around 80%, higher than any other province. The proportion of adults with a degree or higher was 4.8% (2005), the highest in the country.

The province also boasts four universities:
*Cape Peninsula University of Technology
*Stellenbosch University
*University of Cape Town
*University of the Western Cape

The province is also home to the South African Military Academy.

== Culture ==
===Cuisine===

Types of cuisine originating from the Western Cape include Dutch and Malay cuisines. Other types of South African cuisine are also found and commonly enjoyed in the province. Over 50% of all cheese in South Africa is produced in the Western Cape. Four of the top ten entries in Trip Advisor&#x27;s Best Fine Dining Restaurants – Africa list for 2021 are in the Western Cape.

===Winelands===

The Western Cape is known for its wine production and vineyards. The winelands are divided into six main regions: Boberg, Breede River Valley, Cape South Coast, Coastal Region, Klein Karoo and Olifants River. Each has unique climate, topography and fertile soil. Distilled wine or brandy is produced in the Cape Winelands, Overberg, and Garden Route districts of the province. Brandy from these regions is regarded as amongst the best in the world due to the high, legally-enforced distilling standards in the region, technically making it equivalent to Cognac.

<text>Mpumalanga () is one of the nine provinces of South Africa. The name means &quot;East&quot;, or literally &quot;The Place Where the Sun Rises&quot; in the Nguni languages. Mpumalanga lies in eastern South Africa, bordering Eswatini and Mozambique. It shares borders with the South African provinces of Limpopo to the north, Gauteng to the west, the Free State to the southwest, and KwaZulu-Natal to the south. The capital is Mbombela.

Mpumalanga was formed in 1994, when the area that was the Eastern Transvaal was merged with the former bantustans KaNgwane, KwaNdebele and parts of Lebowa and Gazankulu. Although the contemporary borders of the province were only formed at the end of apartheid, the region and its surroundings have a history that extends back thousands of years. Much of its history, and current significance is as a region of trade.

== History ==

=== Precolonial Era ===

Archeological sites in the Mpumalanga region indicate settlement by humans and their ancestors dating back 1.7 million years. Rock paintings, engravings and other archeological evidence throughout the province indicate that Mpumalanga has a long history of human habitation by groups of hunter gatherers. Excavations not far from the Mpumalanga border in the Origstad district, show evidence of Middle Stone Age habitation dating back to 40,000 years ago. The Lion Cavern, in Ngwenya on the Eswatini border, shows evidence of people mining iron ore in the Mpumalanga region and surrounding areas from at least 28 000 years ago.

Evidence from mine shafts and trade goods shows that there was notable industry in tin, copper, gold, iron, ochre, and bronze. The Lydenburg Heads, from around 500 CE, are Africa&#x27;s oldest Iron Age artworks south of the equator and were found in Mpumalanga. Evidence from a site near Mbombela shows evidence of agricultural societies from between the 6th to 17th century.

Mbayi stone-walled sites on the Mpumalanga highveld are indicative of a large precolonial agropastoral society between ~1500 and 1820 CE. These societies became centers of trade, with increasingly large and centralised populations This pattern increased as they connected to the Portuguese trading post in Maputo Bay.

In this era, groups that would become the Swazi, Pedi, Ndebele, Tsonga,Mapulana and others established themselves in the area that is now Mpumalanga.

=== Colonial era ===
In 1845, as part of the Great Trek, the first Dutch-speaking colonial settlers arrived in what they called the eastern Transvaal. The rest of the 19th century in the region was characterised by colonial encroachment and conflict over land and political control. In 1852, the Boers established the South African Republic. The well established Pedi, Swazi and Zulu kingdoms put up significant resistance against the settlers. The Pedi fought wars with the Boers in 1876 (see Sekhukhune Wars) and the Zulu fought with British settlers in 1879 (see Anglo-Zulu War). These interconnected conflicts played a role in shifting the balance of power in southern Africa to colonial control. After 1860, missionaries, especially German missionaries like Alexander Merensky set up mission stations in the region, spreading Christianity and European values.

Just as the region had been a center for trade in the precolonial era, in the colonial era, the Eastern Transvaal region became an important thoroughfare for trade between Johannesburg and Delagoa Bay (now Maputo). Gold mining around areas like Pilgrims Rest and Barberton and farming were the main forms of economic activity. On farms in the Transvaal, under a system known as Inboekstelsel, Boers carried out raids to capture children and forced them into indentured labour. During the South African War, the region was the site of notable battles.

=== Apartheid ===
When the National Party came to power in 1948, their policy of apartheid intensified the segregation that had defined communities in the Transvaal. Under a policy of forced removals, Black South Africans were evicted from areas reserved for white people and moved into homelands, including KaNgwane, KwaNdebele, Lebowa and Gazankulu. As the apartheid regime implemented oppressive policies that defined almost every aspect of life, activists responded with resistance.

In 1959, the small town of Bethal on what is now the Mpumalanga highveld was the center of the anti-apartheid consumer potato boycott in response to the working conditions Black South African labourers faced on farms in the area. The region was influenced by dynamics in exile and elsewhere in the country, for instance Black Consciousness, the Sharpeville Massacre and the 1976 Soweto Uprisings. In the 1980s, under intense repression, youth and labour organizations moblized against the government and townships and Bantustans erupted in political unrest and violence.

In 1986, an avoidable disaster killed 177 mine workers in Kinross Mine in the region&#x27;s highveld. The response to the disaster by the National Union of Mineworkers was a key point in the South African labour struggle. By the late 1980s, the intensity of resistance across South Africa (including areas like Mpumalanga, which hadn&#x27;t previously been seen as key areas of resistance) combined with economic factors and international pressure was strong enough to end apartheid. On 27 April 1994, when South Africa held its first democratic elections, Mpumalanga province was formed. It was originally called the &quot;Eastern Transvaal&quot; province, but the name was later changed to Mpumalanga on 24 August 1995.

=== Post-apartheid ===
The liberation movement turned leading party, the African National Congress (ANC) came into power in Mpumalanga after white minority rule ended. A program of land redistribution, aimed at granting land back to the black communities who were forcibly moved during apartheid, had redistributed tens of thousands of hectares to these communities and their descendants. However, the process has been marked by corruption, controversy and has been seen as inadequate to address the extent of apartheid spatial planning.

In 2001, 1,270 hectares of the Boomplaats farm near Mashishing was the first farm in South Africa to be expropriated.

== Geography ==
The Drakensberg escarpment divides Mpumalanga into a westerly half consisting mainly of high-altitude grassland called the Highveld and an eastern half situated in low-altitude subtropical Lowveld/Bushveld, mostly savanna habitat. The southern half of the Kruger National Park is in the latter region. The Drakensberg exceeds heights of 2000 m in most places, with this central region of Mpumalanga being very mountainous. These regions have alpine grasslands and small pockets of Afromontane forest. The Lowveld is relatively flat with interspersed rocky outcrops. The Lebombo Mountains form a low range in the far east, on the border with Mozambique.

Some of the oldest rocks on earth have been found in the Barberton area; these ancient greenstones and metamorphosed granites form the Crocodile River Mountains in the southeast of the province. The Lowveld is underlaid by African Cratonic Basement rocks of ages in excess of 2 billion years. The Highveld is mostly Karoo Sequence sedimentary rock of a younger, Carboniferous to Permian age.

Mpumalanga is the only South African province to border two provinces of Mozambique (Gaza Province to the northeast and Maputo Province to the east), as well as all four regions of Eswatini (Lubombo, Hhohho, Manzini, and Shiselweni districts).

=== Climate ===
The Lowveld is subtropical, due to its latitude and proximity to the warm Indian Ocean. The Highveld is comparatively much cooler and drier, due to its elevation of 1700 m to 2300 m above sea level. The Drakensberg escarpment receives the most precipitation, with all other areas being moderately well-watered by mostly-summer thunderstorms. The Highveld often experiences considerable freezing, while the Lowveld is mostly frost-free. Winter rainfall is rare, except for some drizzle on the escarpment. The differences in climate are demonstrated by comparing the capital, Mbombela, which is in the Lowveld, with Belfast, which is an hour away on the Highveld:

* Mbombela averages: January maximum: 29 °C (min: 19 °C), July maximum: 23 °C (min: 6 °C), annual precipitation: 767 mm
* Belfast averages: January maximum: 23 °C (min: 12 °C), June maximum: 15 °C (min: 1 °C), annual precipitation: 878 mm
With climate change in the province, rainfall is becoming more variable, temperatures and evaporation rates are rising and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. It is predicted that these changes will shift biomes so that most of the province will be savanna. 

== Ecology ==
Some of the earliest signs of life on Earth have been found in Mpumalanga. In the Makhonjwa mountain range&#x27;s greenstone belt near Barberton, a fossil layer shows microbial activity that is 3.22 billion years old. This discovery indicates that life emerged on Earth 300 million years earlier than previously thought.

Mpumalanga has a high plant and animal diversity. Many species are endemic to the province.

=== Endemic species ===

The diverse and special flora and fauna of the province enjoys protection in a range of nature reserves.
* Barberton Nature Reserve
* Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve
* Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, previously known as Gaza-Kruger-Gonarezhou Transfrontier Park. This international game park brings together some of the best and most established wildlife areas in southern Africa. The park is managed as an integrated unit across an unprecedented three international boundaries which includes the Kruger National Park (South Africa), Limpopo National Park (Mozambique) and Gonarezhou National Park (Zimbabwe).
* Lowveld National Botanical Garden in Mbombela 
* Sabi Sand Game Reserve, which is built up of numerous private reserves: Nottens Bush Camp, Idube Safari Lodge, Chitwa Chitwa Game Lodge, Djuma Game Reserve, Exeter Game Lodge, Inyati Private Game Reserve, Leopard Hills Private Game Reserve, Lion Sands Private Game Reserve, Londolozi Game Reserve, Mala Mala Game Reserve, Savanna Private Game Reserve and Ulusaba Game Lodge.
* Verloren Vallei near Dullstroom

Many species of plants are unique to the different geological formations within Mpumalanga. Some examples of these formations include serpentines of Barberton Mountains, norites of Sekhukhuneland, quartzites of Blyde River Canyon, and the dolomites in the northern plateaus.

== Law and government ==

Mpumalanga is governed by the Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature, a unicameral system of 30 legislators democratically elected though a closed list system. Under the constitution of South Africa, the legislature is intended to create laws, promote public participation and provide oversight. From 1994 to the present, the African National Congress has been the leading party in the Mpumalanga legislature. As of the 2019 elections, the Economic Freedom Fighters, Democratic Alliance and Freedom Front Plus are in opposition in the legislature. Elected every five years, the premier of Mpumalanga is the head of government in the province. Since 2024 Mandla Ndlovu has held the office of premier.

== Municipalities ==


Mpumalanga Province is divided into three district municipalities. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 18 local municipalities:

=== District municipalities ===
* Ehlanzeni District
** Bushbruckridge
** Mbombela
** Nkomazi
** Thaba Chweu
** Umjindi

* Gert Sibande District
** Albert Luthuli
** Dipaleseng
** Govan Mbeki
** Lekwa
** Mkhondo
** Msukaligwa
** Pixley ka Seme

* Nkangala District
** Delmas
** Dr JS Moroka
** Emalahleni
** Highlands
** Steve Tshwete
** Thembisile
== Economy ==

=== Farming ===

68% of land area in the province is used by agriculture. The climatic contrasts between the drier Highveld region, with its cold winters, and the hot, humid Lowveld allow for a variety of agricultural activities. Mpumalanga has been an important supplier of fruit and vegetables for local and international markets for decades. A history of dispossession mean that farming land is largely white owned, although policies of land redistribution era aim to address this.

Crops include maize, wheat, sorghum, barley, sunflower seed, soybeans, macadamias, groundnuts, sugar cane, vegetables, coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco, citrus, subtropical and deciduous fruit. Natural grazing covers approximately 14% of Mpumalanga. The main products are beef, mutton, wool, poultry and dairy.

Farming in the province is driven by both a combination of seasonal, permanent and temporary labourers. Conditions on farms vary widely but seasonal and temporary workers, many of whom are migrant workers from nearby Mozambique, face intense insecurity.

Forestry is extensive around Sabie and Graskop. Located near the forests, Ngodwana is the site of one of South Africa&#x27;s largest paper mills (Sappi).

=== Mining ===
Extensive mining is done and the minerals found include gold, platinum group metals, silica, chromite, vanadiferous magnetite, argentiferous zinc, antimony, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, tin, coal, andalusite, chrysotile asbestos, kieselguhr, limestone, magnesite, talc and shale.

Gold was first discovered in Mpumalanga province in 1883 by Auguste Roberts in the mountains surrounding what is now Barberton. Gold is still mined in the Barberton area today.

Mpumalanga accounts for 83% of South Africa&#x27;s coal production. 90% of South Africa&#x27;s coal consumption is used for electricity generation and the synthetic fuel industry. Coal power stations are in proximity to the coal deposits. A coal liquefaction plant in Secunda (Secunda CTL) is one of the country&#x27;s two petroleum-from-coal extraction plants, which is operated by the synthetic fuel company Sasol.

The high density of coal power stations on the Mpumalanga highveld means that the region has the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution in the world.

=== Attractions ===
Mpumalanga is popular with tourists. Kruger National Park, established in 1898 for the protection of Lowveld wildlife, covering , is a popular destination. The other major tourist attractions include the Sudwala Caves and the Blyde River Canyon.

Many activities including the big jump, mountain and quad biking, horse trails, river rafting and big game viewing are endemic to the region. This is &quot;Big Five&quot; territory. Towns in the Lowveld are Barberton, Mbombela, White River, Sabie, Graskop, Hazyview, Malelane, Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest, Lydenburg and Nkomazi.

In 2008, a haute cuisine route was formed, trickling from Mbombela down to Hazyview. The Lowveld gourmet route covers the four top fine dining restaurants the area has to offer. The restaurants include Summerfields Kitchen, Oliver&#x27;s Restaurant, Orange and Salt.

== Culture ==
Mpumalanga is home to a diverse range of cultures, including Swazi, Ndebele, Afrikaans, Tsonga, Zulu, Mapulana, Portuguese and Pedi communities.

The Ndebele Cultural Village at Botshabelo is a renowned center of cultural heritage, with displays of Ndebele house painting. Ndebele artist Esther Mahalangu gained international acclaim for her artwork rooted in Ndebele traditions and geometric patterns. Prominent South African artist Gerard Sekoto was born in Botshabelo.

Many celebrated South African musicians, such as Ray Phiri, Rebecca Malope and Pretty Yende, are from Mpumalanga.

Since 2003, Mpumalanga&#x27;s capital city, Mbombela, has hosted the Afrikaans national arts festival Innibos. The festival features music, comedy, arts, crafts and theatre.

==Gallery==
== Demographics ==

Mpumalanga&#x27;s population is 4,039,939 people (according to the 2011 census). The average population density is 52.81 people per km².

Some 30% of the people speak siSwati, the language of neighbouring Eswatini, with 26% speaking isiZulu, 10.3% isiNdebele, 10.2% Sepedi and 11.6% Xitsonga. As of the 2011 census, approximately 90.65% of Mpumalanga&#x27;s population are Black, 7.51% are White, and 0.91% are Coloured and 0.69% are Indian or Asian.

<text>The Regional Bus and Rail Company of Ticino (, known by its Italian initials FART) is a limited company in the Swiss southern canton of Ticino, which provides the urban and suburban bus network in and around Locarno in Switzerland. It also operates the cable cars between Verdasio and Rasa, Ticino, and between Intragna–Pila–Costa on behalf of the owning companies. Together with the Italian company (SSIF) they operate the railway between and , known as the in Switzerland and in Italy.

==Bus lines==
==Centovallina/Vigezzina railway==
Centovallina/Vigezzina railway line through the Swiss Centovalli and the Italian Valle Vigezzo connects the Gotthard trans-Alpine rail route at Locarno railway station with the Simplon trans-Alpine route at Domodossola, Italy. There are 10 stations on the Swiss side of the frontier and 12 stations on the Italian side, the complete rail journey takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Apart from being an important public service, the route of the railway is very scenic and popular with tourists.

===Rolling stock===
Traffic on the Centovallina and Vigezzina is fully in the hand of electric motor coaches. A series of 12 articulated EMUs ABe 4/6, built in 1992 by &quot;Vevey Technologies&quot; made up most through workings until 2007, often working in pairs. 8 ABe 4/6 51-58 are owned by FART, 4 ABe 4/6 61–64 by SSIF.

Nine articulated railcars from 1959–1968, three-element ABe 8/8 21-24 and two-element ABe or ABDe 6/6 31-35 cannot work in MU but can pull a trailer or two (101...111 and 201 from 1923, 120-123 from 1964, 130 from 1948).

2004 SSIF ordered three three-car panoramic multiple units from the Officine Ferroviaire Veronesi and Škoda Works. Soon the order was changed to three four-car trains. Delivery took place in 2007.

* Driving motor, Locarno direction: Be 4/4 Pp 82, 84, 86
* Non-driving motor: Be 4/4 Pi 87, 88, 89
* Trailer: Rimorchiata P 810, 811, 812
Classifications ABe and Be don&#x27;t match with classes available in every vehicle. In July 2008 the following consists were working:
* 85 - 812 - 89 - 86 1st class at the Locarno end (whole coach 86)
* 83 - 87 - 810 - 82 1st class at the Domodossola end (coach 83)
* 81 - 88 - 811 - 84 1st class at both ends (end compartment of coaches 81 and 84)

Off-season, these consists may be reduced to three vehicles. As a replacement, SSIF had ABe 8/8 24 fitted with a new cabody, looking very similar to the new trains. However, number of seats is much smaller than in a new train, thus it must be followed by an ABe 4/6 to allow transporting all passengers.

===History===
A formal request for the licensing of a rail network was made by the mayor of Locarno, Francesco Balli, in 1898, but although construction of the Centovalli Railway was begun in May 1913, the collapse of the financing bank later that year, together with the intervention of the First World War meant that construction was not resumed until August 1921, with the line being constructed from each end and meeting on 27 March 1923 and public service being inaugurated on 25 November 1923. On 12 November 1918 Italy and Switzerland had signed a contract about the construction of a narrow gauge railway, Locarno - Domodossola. This contract fixed the cross acceptance of Italian vehicles in Switzerland and vice versa without needing a second approval.

<doc id="313649" wikidata="Q155649" url="?curid=313649" title="Richard Holbrooke">
<text>Richard Charles Albert Holbrooke (April 24, 1941 – December 13, 2010) was an American diplomat and author. He was the only person to have held the position of Assistant Secretary of State for two different regions of the world (Asia from 1977 to 1981 and Europe from 1994 to 1996).

From 1993 to 1994, he was U.S. Ambassador to Germany. He was long well-known among journalists and in diplomatic circles. Holbrooke became familiar to the wider public in 1995 when he, together with former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, brokered a peace agreement among the warring factions in Bosnia leading to the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords. Holbrooke was a prime contender to succeed Warren Christopher as Secretary of State but was passed over in 1996 as President Bill Clinton chose Madeleine Albright instead. 

From 1999 to 2001, Holbrooke served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.
He was an adviser to the presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry in 2004. Holbrooke then joined the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator Hillary Clinton and became a top foreign policy adviser. Holbrooke was considered a likely candidate for Secretary of State had Kerry or Hillary Clinton been elected president. In January 2009, Holbrooke was appointed as a special adviser on Pakistan and Afghanistan, working under President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. During his career, Holbrooke worked to improve the lives of refugees, particularly the Hmong of Indochina. On December 13, 2010, Holbrooke died from complications of an aortic dissection.

Holbrooke&#x27;s unfulfilled ambition was to become Secretary of State; he, along with George Kennan and Chip Bohlen, were considered among the most influential U.S. diplomats who never achieved that position. Several considered Holbrooke&#x27;s role in the Dayton Accords to merit the Nobel Peace Prize.

== Early life ==
Holbrooke was born on April 24, 1941, in New York City, to Dan Holbrooke, a doctor, and Trudi Kearl (née Moos), a potter; brother, Andrew, survives him. Holbrooke&#x27;s mother, whose Jewish family fled Hamburg in 1933 for Buenos Aires before coming to New York, took him to Quaker meetings on Sundays. She stated: &quot;I was an atheist, his father was an atheist... We never thought of giving Richard a Jewish upbringing. The Quaker meetings seemed interesting.&quot;

Holbrooke&#x27;s father, who died of colon cancer when Richard was 15 years old, was born of Polish Jewish parents in Warsaw and took the name Holbrooke after migrating to the United States in 1939. The original family name was Goldbrajch. During his teens, Holbrooke spent more time at the house of his friend David Rusk than his own home. David&#x27;s father was Dean Rusk who became President Kennedy&#x27;s Secretary of State in 1960. Rusk inspired Holbrooke; however, he did not give him any special treatment during his career.

After Scarsdale High School, Holbrooke earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from Brown University in 1962, attending on a full-tuition scholarship. He was later a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, leaving in 1970.
At Brown, Holbrooke was the Editor-in-Chief of the Brown Daily Herald in his senior year (1961–62).

== Career ==
=== Foreign Service (1962–1969) ===
President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s call to service inspired Holbrooke to enter government work. A few weeks after college graduation, Holbrooke entered the Foreign Service where he underwent Vietnamese language training. He served for six years in Vietnam, first in the Mekong Delta, as a civilian representative for the Agency for International Development working on the rural Pacification Program, a program supporting the South Vietnam government with economic development and enacting local political reforms. Holbrooke later became a staff assistant to Ambassadors Maxwell Taylor and Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., by securing the position from his best friend, Anthony Lake.

During this time, he served with many other young diplomats who would play a major role in American foreign policy in the decades ahead, including John Negroponte, Frank G. Wisner, Les Aspin and Peter Tarnoff. When Holbrooke was 24, he joined a team of experts, formed by President Lyndon Johnson that was separate from the National Security Council.

Following his time in the White House, Holbrooke served as a special assistant to Under Secretaries of State (then the number-two position in the State Department) Nicholas Katzenbach and Elliot Richardson. In 1968, Holbrooke was asked to be part of the American delegation to the 1968 Paris peace talks, which was led by former New York Governor Averell Harriman and Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance. He also drafted a volume of the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret report on the government&#x27;s decision-making in Vietnam. Following these assignments, Holbrooke spent a year as a mid-career fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University.

=== Peace Corps and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; (1970–1976) ===
In 1970, at his own request, Holbrooke was assigned to be the Peace Corps Director in Morocco. Holbrooke initially rejected an offer to become the editor of the magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; instead recommending his friend, John Campbell. After two years, he left the Foreign Service to become the managing editor of the magazine after Campbell died of thyroid cancer. Holbrooke held the position from 1972–1976. During his tenure, the magazine ran investigative reports on Vietnam and the Middle East which disturbed some members of the foreign policy community. At the same time (1974–75), he was a consultant to the President&#x27;s Commission on the Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy and was a contributing editor to &quot;Newsweek International&quot;.

=== Carter Administration (1977–1981) ===
In the summer of 1976, Holbrooke left &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; to serve as campaign coordinator for national security affairs to Governor Jimmy Carter (D-Ga.) in his bid for the White House. During the campaign, Holbrooke helped Carter prepare for his foreign policy debates with President Gerald Ford. After Carter&#x27;s victory, Holbrooke followed in the footsteps of such diplomatic mentors as Philip Habib, Dean Rusk and Averell Harriman and, on March 31, 1977, became Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, making him the youngest person ever to hold that position, a post he held until 1981. While at State, he was a top adviser to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. During his service, he feuded with Carter&#x27;s National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, although they both held similar positions on policy. Holbrooke oversaw a warming with Cold War adversaries in the region, culminating in the normalization of relations with China in December 1978. He was also deeply involved in bringing hundreds of thousands of Indochinese refugees to the United States, thus beginning a lifelong involvement with the refugee issue.

=== East Timor controversy ===
In August 1977, then Assistant Secretary of State, Holbrooke traveled to Indonesia to meet with President Suharto in the midst of Indonesia&#x27;s occupation of East Timor, in which over 100,000 East Timorese were ultimately killed or starved to death. According to Brad Simpson, director of the Indonesia and East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archives, Holbrooke had visited officially to press for human rights reform but, after meeting Suharto, had instead praised him for Indonesia&#x27;s human rights improvements, for the steps that Indonesia had taken to open East Timor to the West, and for allowing a delegation of congressmen to enter the territory under strict military guard, where they were greeted by staged celebrations welcoming the Indonesian armed forces.

=== Wall Street years (1981–1993) ===
In January 1981, Holbrooke left government and became both senior advisor to Lehman Brothers and vice president of Public Strategies, a consulting firm he formed with James A. Johnson, a former top aide to Walter Mondale. From 1985 until 1993, Holbrooke served as managing director of Lehman Brothers. During this time, he co-authored &quot;Counsel to the President&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-selling memoirs of legendary Democratic wise man and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, published in 1991. He was a top policy adviser to then-Senator Al Gore (D-TN) during his 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. And four years later he advised Bill Clinton, in his quest for the White House.

Holbrooke also remained deeply engaged in prominent foreign policy issues. He visited Bosnia twice in 1992 as a private citizen and a member of the board of Refugees International, witnessing firsthand the damage and devastating human costs of the conflict. This experience committed Holbrooke to pursuing a more aggressive policy in the Balkans and, in a memo to his colleagues, he urged that &quot;Bosnia will be the key test of American policy in Europe. We must therefore succeed in whatever we attempt.&quot;

=== U.S. Ambassador to Germany (1993–1994) ===
In 1993, after Bill Clinton became president, Holbrooke was initially slated to be Ambassador to Japan due to his depth of knowledge and long experience in Asian affairs. However, this appointment eventually went to former Vice President Walter Mondale, and Holbrooke unexpectedly was appointed Ambassador to Germany. In 1992, Holbrooke was also a member of the Carnegie Commission on America and a Changing World and Chairman and principal author of the bipartisan Commission on Government and Renewal, sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation and the Peterson Institute. He was Chairman and principal author of the &quot;Memo to the President-Elect: Harnessing Process to Purpose,&quot; a blue-ribbon Commission report sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Institute for International Economics.

Holbrooke served in Germany during a dramatic moment: only a few years after German reunification, he helped shape U.S. relations with a new Germany. A highlight of his tenure was President Bill Clinton&#x27;s visit to Berlin in July 1994, when thousands of Germans crammed the streets to welcome the American leader. While in Germany, Holbrooke also was a key figure in shaping the U.S. policy to promote NATO enlargement, as well as its approach to the war in Bosnia.

In 1994, while serving as U.S. Ambassador to Germany, he conceived the idea of a cultural exchange center between the people of Berlin and Americans. With Richard von Weizsäcker, former President of Germany, and Henry A. Kissinger as co-Chairman, this institution—The American Academy in Berlin—was announced on September 9, 1994, the day after the U.S. Army Berlin Brigade left Berlin. The American Academy in Berlin opened three years later in a villa on the Wannsee once owned by the German-Jewish banker Hans Arnhold. The American Academy in Berlin is now (as of 2009) one of the most important links between Germany and the United States. Its Fellows have included writers (including Pulitzer Prize winning authors Arthur Miller and Jeffrey Eugenides), economists, government officials, and public policy experts such as Dennis Ross and former U.S. Ambassador to The People&#x27;s Republic of China, J. Stapleton Roy. In 2008, The American Academy in Berlin awarded its annual Henry A. Kissinger Award for Transatlantic Relations to George H. W. Bush. In 2007, the Award&#x27;s first recipient was former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.

=== Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs (1994–1996) ===

In 1994, Holbrooke returned to Washington to become the assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, a position he held until 1996, when he resigned for personal reasons (he had recently married the author Kati Marton and wished to return to New York). While assistant secretary, Holbrooke led the effort to implement the policy to enlarge NATO and had the distinction of leading the negotiation team charged with resolving the Balkans crisis.

On August 19, an Armoured personnel carrier following the Humvee Holbrooke was riding in fell off the side of Mt. Igman near Sarajevo. Three of Holbrooke&#x27;s five-man delegation team perished in the incident. In Holbrooke&#x27;s telling of the incident, he portrayed himself and the other surviving member of his delegation, General Clark, as active participants in the rescue mission. However, Holbrooke&#x27;s biographer George Packer, discredited Holbrooke&#x27;s story, stating that another man traveling with the delegation, Colonel Banky, was in fact the person who searched for the APC while Holbrooke and Clark waited near the Humvee. A report on the incident stated that the driver of the APC was going too fast.

In Paris in December 1995, Holbrooke was the chief architect of the Dayton Peace Accords which ended the three-and-a-half-year-long war in Bosnia. In 1996, he was awarded the Manfred Wörner Medal, awarded by the German Ministry of Defense for public figures who have rendered &quot;special meritorious service to peace and freedom in Europe.&quot;

=== Balkan envoy (1996–1999) ===

Upon leaving the State Department, Holbrooke was asked by President Clinton to become, as a private citizen, a special envoy to the Balkans given his service in the region. In 1997, Holbrooke became a special envoy to Cyprus and the Balkans on a pro-bono basis as a private citizen. During 1998 and 1999, in his capacity as special presidential envoy, Holbrooke worked to end the conflict between the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), who were fighting for an independent Kosovo in the Kosovo War. Holbrooke returned to Bosnia two years later to the city of Sarajevo. In March 1999 he traveled to Belgrade to deliver the ultimatum to Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević before the NATO attack began. Holbrooke was strongly anti-Serbia and referred to Serbs as &quot;murderous assholes&quot;. Holbrooke wrote numerous articles about his experiences in the Balkans, and in 1998, published the widely acclaimed book, &quot;To End a War&quot;, a memoir of his time as the chief negotiator of the Dayton Peace Accords, ending the Bosnian civil war. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked the book as one of the eleven best books of the year in 1998. In his book he assessed Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic negatively stating, &quot;although he paid lip service to the principles of a multi-ethnic state, he was not the democrat that some supporters in the West saw&quot;.

According to Radovan Karadžić and Muhamed Sacirbey, ex-Bosnian foreign minister, Holbrooke signed an agreement with Karadžić that if the latter withdrew from politics he would not be sent to the Hague tribunal. Holbrooke denied these terms, saying Karadžić&#x27;s statement was &quot;a flat-out lie.&quot;

Holbrooke and Bildt were considered candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize as a result of the Dayton Peace Accords. However, Holbrooke&#x27;s personal lobbying for the award may have been detrimental to their chances.

=== U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (1999–2001) ===
In August 1999, Holbrooke was sworn-in as the 22nd U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, replacing Bill Richardson. Holbrooke initially had issues passing the Senate because of perceived abuses of authority while as Clinton&#x27;s Balkan envoy. During his tenure, Holbrooke was known for innovation and for achieving diplomatic breakthroughs that settled a series of longstanding tensions in the United States&#x27; relationship with the UN. His highest-profile accomplishment was negotiating a historic deal between the United States and the UN&#x27;s then 188-Member States to settle the bulk of arrears owed by the United States to the United Nations. The deal, achieved with the agreement of the UN&#x27;s entire membership in late December 2000, lowered the rate of UN dues paid by the United States to the UN, fulfilling the terms of a U.S. law championed by Senators Jesse Helms (R-NC) and Joseph Biden (D-DE). In return for the reduction, the United States paid the UN over $900 million in back dues. During his time as ambassador Hobrooke forwent the official ambassador&#x27;s residence at the Waldorf Astoria hotel instead letting his chief of staff temporarily use the residence. 

Holbrooke secured a reduction in U.S. dues to the UN despite a booming American economy by enfolding the U.S. position within a broad push to update the UN&#x27;s long-outdated financial system. As negotiations reached a critical phase in the fall of 2000, Holbrooke bridged a gap between what the United States was legally permitted to pay and the amounts the rest of the UN membership were willing to shoulder by securing an unprecedented contribution by billionaire Ted Turner, founder of the UN Foundation. Holbrooke and his team received a standing ovation in the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee when the terms of the deal were presented.

Holbrooke&#x27;s other achievements as UN Ambassador included getting the United Nations Security Council to debate and pass a resolution on HIV/AIDS, the first time that body had treated public health as a matter of global security. In January 2000, Holbrooke used the United States&#x27; presidency of the UN Security Council to spotlight a series of crises in Africa, holding six consecutive UN debates that brought together leaders from the region and the across the globe, including former South African President Nelson Mandela and then U.S. Vice President Al Gore, to catalyze more effective UN interventions in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and elsewhere. Holbrooke decried a &quot;double standard&quot; whereby African conflicts received insufficient global attention.

In 2000, Holbrooke led a UN Security Council delegation in a series of diplomatic negotiations throughout Africa, including to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, and Uganda. Holbrooke also secured membership for Israel in the UN&#x27;s Western European and Others regional group, ending Israel&#x27;s historic exclusion from regional group deliberations and allowing it to, for the first time, stand for election to leadership positions in UN sub-bodies. During the final weeks of his term, Holbrooke secured consultative status at the United Nations for Hadassah, the Jewish women&#x27;s service organization, overcoming strenuous objections from certain Arab delegations.

==== GBCHealth ====
In January 2000, when the United States was in the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council, Ambassador Holbrooke held an unprecedented meeting of the Security Council to discuss AIDS in Africa. No Security Council session in the history of the UN had ever been devoted to a health issue prior to this historic meeting. Vice President Al Gore presided over the Security Council and declared that AIDS was a security threat to all nations.

Upon leaving the UN a year later, Holbrooke took over a nearly moribund NGO that was intended to mobilize businesses and corporations in the fight against AIDS. At the time, it had 17 members. Over the next six years, Holbrooke turned this organization—originally called the Global Business Council on HIV/AIDS—into a worldwide organization with over 225 members. It expanded to include malaria and tuberculosis, becoming the &quot;Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria&quot; in 2006. In 2011, the organization became GBCHealth and expanded its mandate to include an array of health issues. GBCHealth is the official focal point for mobilizing the business community in support of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and has grown into an important part of the ongoing war against these three diseases.

=== Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign ===
Holbrooke was Clinton&#x27;s lead foreign policy advisor in her 2008 campaign for president and was believed to be her preferred choice for Secretary of State. When Obama defeated Clinton and selected her as Secretary of State, Holbrooke was her preferred option for Deputy Secretary of State, but was vetoed by Obama.

=== Special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (2009–2010) ===
In January 2009, Holbrooke was appointed by President Obama as special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP). Holbrooke was never in serious contention to become Obama&#x27;s secretary of state although he interviewed for the position. After Hillary Clinton became secretary of state she requested that Holbrooke become SRAP, a newly created role which he had previously advocated for. Holbrooke&#x27;s tenure as SRAP has been considered lackluster. Holbrooke&#x27;s relationship with President Obama was minimal and his relationship was even worse with Joe Biden. He became unpopular in the administration when he attempted to aid Afghan President Hamid Karzai&#x27;s political opponents during his reelection bid. Holbrooke was well-liked in Pakistan by civilians because he actively sought to build a relationship with their country. In that position, he also helped kill an initiative to &quot;back the creation of a new UN special envoy empowered to pursue peace talks with the Taliban.&quot; He also asserted that:

one of the most cost-effective steps Washington could take would be to boost the agriculture sector of Afghanistan, which in years past had been a productive and profitable source of exports. Replicate the past success, he said, and Afghans would have money and jobs—and that, in turn, would create stability in the country. He called for &#x27;a complete rethink&#x27; of the drug problem in Afghanistan, suggesting that draconian eradication programs were bound to fail.

However, according to David Corn, &quot;Holbrooke&#x27;s skill set did not lead to much accomplishment in Afghanistan. He never worked out a productive relationship with Afghan President Hamid Karzai … He butted heads with other administration officials and was dismissed by European colleagues. He brokered no breakthroughs.&quot;

=== Other activities ===
Holbrooke was the vice chairman of Perseus LLC, a leading private equity firm. From February 2001 until July 2008, Holbrooke was a member of the Board of Directors of American International Group. He was a member of the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and formerly served on the Advisory Board of the National Security Network. Holbrooke was also a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Citizens Committee for New York City, and the Economic Club of New York. He was a member of the Trilateral Commission, and he has been listed on their membership roster as one of their &quot;Former Members in Public Service&quot;.

Holbrooke was the Founding Chairman of the American Academy in Berlin; President and CEO of the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, the business alliance against HIV/AIDS, until his appointment as a special envoy by President Barack Obama; and Chairman of the Asia Society. Holbrooke&#x27;s other board memberships included the American Museum of Natural History, Malaria No More (a New York-based nonprofit that was launched at the 2006 White House Summit with the goal of ending all deaths caused by malaria), Partnership for a Secure America, and the National Endowment for Democracy. Holbrooke was also an honorary trustee of the Dayton International Peace Museum, as well as professor-at-large at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, his alma mater. Additionally, Holbrooke was an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy.

Holbrooke also served as vice chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston, managing director of Lehman Brothers, managing editor of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, and director of the Peace Corps in Morocco.

He wrote numerous articles and two books: &quot;To End a War&quot;, and the co-author of &quot;Counsel to the President&quot;, and one volume of &quot;The Pentagon Papers&quot;. He received more than a dozen honorary degrees, including an LL.D. from Bates College in 1999. He wrote a monthly column for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Project Syndicate&quot;.

On March 20, 2007, he appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to mediate in what Stephen Colbert (or rather, his television alter-ego) saw as Willie Nelson infringing on his ice cream flavor time. Holbrooke was the &#x27;ambassador on call&#x27; and after a short mediation process the two parties agreed to taste each other&#x27;s Ben and Jerry&#x27;s ice cream to make amends. He subsequently sang &quot;On the Road Again&quot; in a trio with Colbert and Nelson.

Holbrooke was an Eminent Member of the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation until his death.

In June 2008, Conde Nast Portfolio reported that Holbrooke and his son allegedly got multiple below-rate loans at Countrywide Financial because the corporation considered them &quot;FOA&#x27;s&quot;—&quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; (Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo).

A documentary titled &quot;The Diplomat&quot; centered on the legacy of Holbrooke&#x27;s career appeared on HBO in the fall of 2015. The documentary was directed by his son, David Holbrooke, and features notes from Holbrooke&#x27;s &quot;secret audio diary&quot; which &quot;he dictated on a near daily basis from August 2010 until his death&quot;.

He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group and participated in every conference between 1995 and 2010.

== Positions ==
In January 2001, Holbrooke said that &quot;Iraq will be one of the major issues facing the incoming Bush administration at the United Nations.&quot; Further, &quot;Saddam Hussein&#x27;s activities continue to be unacceptable and, in my view, dangerous to the region and, indeed, to the world, not only because he possesses the potential for weapons of mass destruction but because of the very nature of his regime. His willingness to be cruel internally is not unique in the world, but the combination of that and his willingness to export his problems makes him a clear and present danger at all times.&quot;

On February 24, 2007, Holbrooke delivered the Democratic Party&#x27;s weekly radio address and called for &quot;a new strategy in Iraq&quot;, involving &quot;a careful, phased redeployment of U.S. troops&quot; and a &quot;new diplomatic offensive in the Gulf region to help stabilize Iraq.&quot;

During the 2008 South Ossetia war (1–16 August 2008) between Russia and Georgia, Holbrooke said during a CNN interview that he had predicted the conflict in early 2008.

== Personal life ==
Holbrooke was married three times. His first wife was Larrine Sullivan, whom he married in 1964; they had two sons, David and Anthony, before Holbrooke and Sullivan divorced in 1972. He later married Blythe Babyak, a reporter for &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;, on January 1, 1977; they divorced in 1978. He was married to Kati Marton from 1995 until his death. Before he married Marton, he was involved in a longstanding relationship with the broadcast journalist Diane Sawyer and lived with her for seven years.

Holbrooke had been good friends with diplomat Anthony Lake whom he met in Vietnam in the early 1960s while both of them were in the foreign service. They frequently visited each other and Lake aided Holbrooke throughout the early years of his career. They grew apart when Holbrooke had an affair with Lake&#x27;s wife, eventually rarely speaking, and by the time Lake became Bill Clinton&#x27;s National Security Advisor, their friendship was over.

== Death ==
On December 11, 2010, Holbrooke was admitted to George Washington University Hospital in Washington D.C. after falling ill at the State Department&#x27;s headquarters. While there, he underwent twenty hours of surgery to fix an aortic dissection, a rare condition.

Holbrooke died on December 13, 2010, from complications of the torn aorta. Holbrooke&#x27;s last words before being sedated for surgery, which have been clarified to have been a comical interchange with his doctor, were: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to end this war in Afghanistan.&quot; 

Holbrooke is interred at Oakland Cemetery in Sag Harbor, New York.

==Legacy==
Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;His premature death—while heroically bearing the crushing burdens of Afghanistan and Pakistan—is tragic in more ways than many Americans yet realize.&quot; President Obama memorialized Holbrooke, stating &quot;few have left such a towering legacy as a face of America to the world as Richard Holbrooke&quot;.

On January 14, 2011, Holbrooke&#x27;s memorial service was held at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

The 2014 film &quot;Diplomacy&quot; was dedicated to Holbrooke.

In 2015, Holbrooke&#x27;s son David directed a documentary, &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, which chronicled his father&#x27;s professional life and achievements.

A street in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, is named after Holbrooke, albeit in Albanian transliteration, &quot;Riçard Holbruk&quot;.

==Recognition==
In 1999, Holbrooke received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2011, President Obama created the Richard C. Holbrooke Award for Diplomacy to be awarded annually to up to five individuals or groups the Secretary of State has determined have made &quot;especially meritorious contributions to diplomacy.&quot;

To be against that war... he felt, would mark a man as soft... But that was a moment when the United States needed bucking up to say no to a rush to war.

Holbrooke was not just an appalling human being but a diplomat whose accomplishments were actually quite modest.&quot; (p. 94.)
