<text>Tooth enamel is one of the four major tissues that make up the tooth in humans and many animals, including some species of fish. It makes up the normally visible part of the tooth, covering the crown. The other major tissues are dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is a very hard, white to off-white, highly mineralised substance that acts as a barrier to protect the tooth but can become susceptible to degradation, especially by acids from food and drink. In rare circumstances enamel fails to form, leaving the underlying dentin exposed on the surface.

== Features ==
Enamel is the hardest substance in the human body and contains the highest percentage of minerals (at 96%), with water and organic material composing the rest. The primary mineral is hydroxyapatite, which is a crystalline calcium phosphate. Enamel is formed on the tooth while the tooth develops within the jaw bone before it erupts into the mouth. Once fully formed, enamel does not contain blood vessels or nerves, and is not made of cells. Remineralisation of teeth can repair damage to the tooth to a certain degree but damage beyond that cannot be repaired by the body. The maintenance and repair of human tooth enamel is one of the primary concerns of dentistry.

In humans, enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth, often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5 mm, and thinnest at its border with the cementum at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ).

The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish (bluish) white. It has been suggested that the color is determined by differences in the translucency of enamel, yellowish teeth having a thin, translucent enamel through which the yellow color of the dentin is visible and grayish teeth having a more opaque enamel. The translucency may be attributable to variations in the degree of calcification and homogeneity of the enamel. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue or translucent off-white tone, easily observable on the upper incisors. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. The enamel on primary teeth has a more opaque crystalline form and thus appears whiter than on permanent teeth.

The large amount of mineral in enamel accounts not only for its strength but also for its brittleness. Tooth enamel ranks 5 on Mohs hardness scale (between steel and titanium) and has a Young&#x27;s modulus of 83 GPa. Dentin, less mineralized and less brittle, 3–4 in hardness, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. On radiographs, the differences in the mineralization of different portions of the tooth and surrounding periodontium can be noted; enamel appears lighter than dentin or pulp since it is denser than both and more radiopaque.

Enamel does not contain collagen, as found in other hard tissues such as dentin and bone, but it does contain two unique classes of proteins: amelogenins and enamelins. While the role of these proteins is not fully understood, it is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as a framework for minerals to form on, among other functions. Once it is mature, enamel is almost totally without the softer organic matter. Enamel is avascular and has no nerve supply within it and is not renewed, however, it is not a static tissue as it can undergo mineralization changes.

== Structure ==

The basic unit of enamel is called an enamel rod. Measuring 4–8 μm in diameter, an enamel rod, formally called an enamel prism, is a tightly packed mass of hydroxyapatite crystallites in an organized pattern. In cross section, it is best compared to a keyhole, with the top, or head, oriented toward the crown of the tooth, and the bottom, or tail, oriented toward the root of the tooth.

The arrangement of the crystallites within each enamel rod is highly complex. Both ameloblasts (the cells which initiate enamel formation) and Tomes&#x27; processes affect the crystallites&#x27; pattern. Enamel crystallites in the head of the enamel rod are oriented parallel to the long axis of the rod. When found in the tail of the enamel rod, the crystallites&#x27; orientation diverges slightly (65 degrees) from the long axis.

The arrangement of enamel rods is understood more clearly than their internal structure. Enamel rods are found in rows along the tooth, and within each row, the long axis of the enamel rod is generally perpendicular to the underlying dentin. In permanent teeth, the enamel rods near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) tilt slightly toward the root of the tooth. Understanding enamel orientation is very important in restorative dentistry, because enamel unsupported by underlying dentin is prone to fracture.

The area around the enamel rod is known as interrod enamel. Interrod enamel has the same composition as enamel rod, however a histologic distinction is made between the two because crystallite orientation is different in each. The border where the crystallites of enamel rods and crystallites of interrod enamel meet is called the rod sheath.

Striae of Retzius are incremental lines that appear brown in a stained section of mature enamel. These lines are composed of bands or cross striations on the enamel rods that, when combined in longitudinal sections, seem to traverse the enamel rods. Formed from changes in diameter of Tomes&#x27; processes, these incremental lines demonstrate the growth of enamel, similar to the annual rings on a tree on transverse sections of enamel. The exact mechanism that produces these lines is still being debated. Some researchers hypothesize that the lines are a result of the diurnal (circadian), or 24-hour, metabolic rhythm of the ameloblasts producing the enamel matrix, which consists of an active secretory work period followed by an inactive rest period during tooth development. Thus, each band on the enamel rod demonstrates the work/rest pattern of the ameloblasts that generally occurs over a span of a week.

Perikymata which are associated with the Striae are shallow grooves noted clinically on the nonmasticatory surfaces of some teeth in the oral cavity. Perikymata are usually lost through tooth wear, except on the protected cervical regions of some teeth, especially the permanent maxillary central incisors, canines, and first premolars, and may be confused as dental calculus. Darker than the other incremental lines, the neonatal line is an incremental line that separates enamel formed before and after birth. The neonatal line marks the stress or trauma experienced by the ameloblasts during birth, again illustrating the sensitivity of the ameloblasts as they form enamel matrix. As one would expect, the neonatal line is found in all primary teeth and in the larger cusps of the permanent first molars. They contain irregular structures of enamel prisms with disordered crystallite arrangements basically formed by the abrupt bending of the prisms towards the root; usually, the prisms gradually bent back again to regain their previous orientation.

Gnarled enamel is found at the cusps of teeth. Its twisted appearance results from the orientation of enamel rods and the rows in which they lie.

== Development ==
Enamel formation is part of the overall process of tooth development. Under a microscope, different cellular aggregations are identifiable within the tissues of a developing tooth, including structures known as the enamel organ, dental lamina, and dental papilla. The generally recognized stages of tooth development are the bud stage, cap stage, bell stage, and crown, or calcification, stage. Enamel formation is first seen in the crown stage.}

Amelogenesis, or enamel formation, occurs after the first establishment of dentin, via cells known as ameloblasts. Human enamel forms at a rate of around 4 μm per day, beginning at the future location of cusps, around the third or fourth month of pregnancy. As in all human processes, the creation of enamel is complex, but can generally be divided into two stages. The first stage, called the secretory stage, involves proteins and an organic matrix forming a partially mineralized enamel. The second stage, called the maturation stage, completes enamel mineralization.
In the secretory stage, ameloblasts are polarized columnar cells. In the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells, enamel proteins are released into the surrounding area and contribute to what is known as the enamel matrix, which is then partially mineralized by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. When this first layer is formed, the ameloblasts move away from the dentin, allowing for the development of Tomes&#x27; processes at the apical pole of the cell. Enamel formation continues around the adjoining ameloblasts, resulting in a walled area, or pit, that houses a Tomes&#x27; process, and also around the end of each Tomes&#x27; process, resulting in a deposition of enamel matrix inside of each pit. The matrix within the pit will eventually become an enamel rod, and the walls will eventually become interrod enamel. The only distinguishing factor between the two is the orientation of the calcium phosphate crystallites.

In the maturation stage, the ameloblasts transport substances used in the formation of enamel. Histologically, the most notable aspect of this phase is that these cells become striated, or have a ruffled border. These signs demonstrate that the ameloblasts have changed their function from production, as in the secretory stage, to transportation. Proteins used for the final mineralization process compose most of the transported material. The noteworthy proteins involved are amelogenins, ameloblastins, enamelins, and tuftelins. How these proteins are secreted into the enamel structure is still unknown; other proteins, such as the Wnt signaling components BCL9 and Pygopus, have been implicated in this process. During this process, amelogenins and ameloblastins are removed after use, leaving enamelins and tuftelin in the enamel. By the end of this stage, the enamel has completed its mineralization.

At some point before the tooth erupts into the mouth, but after the maturation stage, the ameloblasts are broken down. Consequently, enamel, unlike many other tissues of the body, has no way to regenerate itself. After destruction of enamel from decay or injury, neither the body nor a dentist can restore the enamel tissue. Enamel can be affected further by non-pathologic processes.

Enamel is covered by various structures in relation to the development of tooth:
:* Nasmyth membrane or enamel cuticle, structure of embryological origin is composed of keratin which gives rise to the enamel organ.
:* Acquired pellicle, structure acquired after tooth eruption is composed of food debris, calculus, dental plaque (organic film).

== Enamel loss ==

The high mineral content of enamel, which makes this tissue the hardest in the human body, also makes it
demineralize in a process that often occurs as dental caries, otherwise known as cavities. Demineralization occurs for several reasons, but the most important cause of tooth decay is the ingestion of fermentable carbohydrates.
Tooth cavities are caused when acids dissolve tooth enamel: Enamel is also lost through tooth wear and enamel fractures.

::Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2(&quot;s&quot;) + 8H+(&quot;aq&quot;) → 10Ca2+(&quot;aq&quot;) + 6HPO42−(&quot;aq&quot;) + 2H2O(&quot;l&quot;)

Sugars and acids from candies, soft drinks, and fruit juices play a significant role in tooth decay, and consequently in enamel destruction. The mouth contains a great number and variety of bacteria, and when sucrose, the most common of sugars, coats the surface of the mouth, some intraoral bacteria interact with it and form lactic acid, which decreases the pH in the mouth. The critical pH for tooth enamel is generally accepted to be pH 5.5. When acids are present and the critical pH is reached, the hydroxyapatite crystallites of enamel demineralize, allowing for greater bacterial invasion deeper into the tooth. The most important bacterium involved with tooth decay is &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;, but the number and type of bacteria varies with the progress of tooth destruction.

Furthermore, tooth morphology dictates that the most common site for the initiation of dental caries is in the deep grooves, pits, and fissures of enamel. This is expected because these locations are impossible to reach with a toothbrush and allow for bacteria to reside there. When demineralization of enamel occurs, a dentist can use a sharp instrument, such as a dental explorer, and &quot;feel a stick&quot; at the location of the decay. As enamel continues to become less mineralized and is unable to prevent the encroachment of bacteria, the underlying dentin becomes affected as well. When dentin, which normally supports enamel, is destroyed by a physiologic condition or by decay, enamel is unable to compensate for its brittleness and breaks away from the tooth easily.
The extent to which tooth decay is likely, known as cariogenicity, depends on factors such as how long the sugar remains in the mouth. Contrary to common belief, it is not the amount of sugar ingested but the frequency of sugar ingestion that is the most important factor in the causation of tooth decay. When the pH in the mouth initially decreases from the ingestion of sugars, the enamel is demineralized and left vulnerable for about 30 minutes. Eating a greater quantity of sugar in one sitting does not increase the time of demineralization. Similarly, eating a lesser quantity of sugar in one sitting does not decrease the time of demineralization. Thus, eating a great quantity of sugar at one time in the day is less detrimental than is a very small quantity ingested in many intervals throughout the day. For example, in terms of oral health, it is better to eat a single dessert at dinner time than to snack on a bag of candy throughout the day.

In addition to bacterial invasion, enamel is also susceptible to other destructive forces. Bruxism, also known as clenching of or grinding on teeth, destroys enamel very quickly. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors. A common misconception is that enamel wears away mostly from chewing, but actually teeth rarely touch during chewing. Furthermore, normal tooth contact is compensated physiologically by the periodontal ligaments and the arrangement of dental occlusion. The truly destructive forces are the parafunctional movements, as found in bruxism, which can cause irreversible damage to the enamel.

Other nonbacterial processes of enamel destruction include abrasion (involving foreign elements, such as toothbrushes), erosion (involving chemical processes, such as dissolving by soft drinks or lemon and other juices), and possibly abfraction (involving compressive and tensile forces).

Though enamel is described as tough, it has a similar brittleness to glass, making it, unlike other natural crack-resistant laminate structures such as shell and nacre, vulnerable to fracture. In spite of this it can withstand bite forces as high as 1,000 N many times a day during chewing. This resistance is due in part to the microstructure of enamel which contains enamel tufts that stabilize such fractures at the dentinoenamel junction. The configuration of the tooth also acts to reduce the tensile stresses that cause fractures during biting.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease can also lead to enamel loss, as acid refluxes up the esophagus and into the mouth, occurring most during overnight sleep.

=== Oral hygiene ===
Because enamel is vulnerable to demineralization, prevention of tooth decay is the best way to maintain the health of teeth. Most countries have wide use of toothbrushes, which can reduce the number of dental biofilm and food particles on enamel. In isolated societies that do not have access to toothbrushes, it is common for those people to use other objects, such as sticks, to clean their teeth. In between two adjacent teeth, floss is used to wipe the enamel surfaces free of plaque and food particles to discourage bacterial growth. Although neither floss nor toothbrushes can penetrate the deep grooves and pits of enamel, good general oral-health habits can usually prevent enough bacterial growth to keep tooth decay from starting. Structural integrity of the enamel is genetic, and so is its predisposition to demineralization or attack from bacteria.

=== Fluoride remineralization ===
Fluoride catalyzes the diffusion of calcium and phosphate into the tooth surface, which in turn remineralizes the crystalline structures in a dental cavity. The remineralized tooth surfaces contain fluoridated hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite, which resist acid attack much better than the original tooth did. Fluoride therapy is used to help prevent dental decay.

Fluoride ions, as an antimicrobial, may activate bacterial genes associated with fluoride riboswitches. The combination of fluoride ions and QAS (quaternary ammonium salts) was found to have a stronger antimicrobial effect on many oral bacteria associated with dental decay, including &quot;S. mutans&quot;.

==== Fluoride in drinking water ====
Most dental professionals and organizations agree that the inclusion of fluoride in public water has been one of the most effective methods of decreasing the prevalence of tooth decay. Fluoride can be found in many locations naturally, such as the ocean and other water sources. The recommended dosage of fluoride in drinking water does not depend on air temperature.

Some groups have spoken out against fluoridated drinking water, for reasons such as the neurotoxicity of fluoride or the damage fluoride can do as fluorosis. Fluorosis is a condition resulting from the overexposure to fluoride, especially between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, and appears as mottled enamel. Consequently, the teeth look unsightly, although the incidence of dental decay in those teeth is very small. Where fluoride is found naturally in high concentrations, filters are often used to decrease the amount of fluoride in water. For this reason, codes have been developed by dental professionals to limit the amount of fluoride a person should take. These codes are supported by the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.

Furthermore, whereas topical fluoride, found in toothpaste and mouthwashes, does not cause fluorosis, its effects are now considered more important than those of systemic fluoride, such as when drinking fluorinated water. However, systemic fluoride works topically as well with fluoride levels in saliva increase also when drinking fluoridated water. Lately, dental professionals are looking for other ways to present fluoride (such as in varnish) or other mineralizing products such as Amorphous calcium phosphate to the community in the form of topical procedures, either done by professionals or self-administered. Mineralization of the incipient lesion instead of restoration later is a prime goal of most dental professionals.

== Dental procedures ==

=== Dental restorations ===

Most dental restorations involve the removal of enamel. Frequently, the purpose of removal is to gain access to the underlying decay in the dentin or inflammation in the pulp. This is typically the case in amalgam restorations and endodontic treatment.

Nonetheless, enamel can sometimes be removed before there is any decay present. The most popular example is the dental sealant. In the past, the process of placing dental sealants involved removing enamel in the deep fissures and grooves of a tooth, followed by replacing it with a restorative material. Presently, it is more common to only remove decayed enamel if present. In spite of this, there are still cases where deep fissures and grooves in enamel are removed in order to prevent decay, and a sealant may or may not be placed depending on the situation. Sealants are unique in that they are preventative restorations for protection from future decay, and have been shown to reduce the risk of decay by 55% over 7 years.

Aesthetics is another reason for the removal of enamel. Removing enamel is necessary when placing crowns and veneers to enhance the appearance of teeth. In both of these instances, when unsupported by underlying dentin, that portion of the enamel is more vulnerable to fracture.

=== Acid-etching techniques ===

Invented in 1955, acid-etching employs dental etchants and is used frequently when bonding dental restoration to teeth. This is important for long-term use of some materials, such as composites and sealants. By dissolving minerals in enamel, etchants remove the outer 10 micrometers on the enamel surface and make a porous layer 5–50 micrometers deep. This roughens the enamel microscopically and results in a greater surface area on which to bond.

The effects of acid-etching on enamel can vary. Important variables are the amount of time the etchant is applied, the type of etchant used, and the current condition of the enamel.

There are three types of patterns formed by acid-etching. Type 1 is a pattern where predominantly the enamel rods are dissolved; type 2 is a pattern where predominantly the area around the enamel rods are dissolved; and type 3 is a pattern where there is no evidence left of any enamel rods. Besides concluding that type 1 is the most favorable pattern and type 3 the least, the explanation for these different patterns is not known for certain but is most commonly attributed to different crystallite orientation in the enamel.

=== Tooth whitening ===

The discoloration of teeth over time can result from exposure to substances such as tobacco, coffee, and tea. The staining occurs in the interprismatic region internally on the enamel, which causes the tooth to appear darker or more yellow overall. In a perfect state, enamel is colorless, but it does reflect underlying tooth structure with its stains since light reflection properties of the tooth are low.

Tooth whitening or tooth bleaching procedures attempt to lighten a tooth&#x27;s color in either of two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.

Studies show that patients who have whitened their teeth take better care of them. However, a tooth whitening product with an overall low pH can put enamel at risk for decay or destruction by demineralization. Consequently, care should be taken and risk evaluated when choosing a product which is very acidic. Tooth whiteners in toothpastes work through a mechanical action. They have mild abrasives which aid in the removal of stains on enamel. Although this can be an effective method, it does not alter the intrinsic color of teeth. Microabrasion techniques employ both methods. An acid is used first to weaken the outer 22–27 micrometers of enamel in order to weaken it enough for the subsequent abrasive force. This allows for removal of superficial stains in the enamel. If the discoloration is deeper or in the dentin, this method of tooth whitening will not be successful.

== Related pathology ==

There are 14 different types of amelogenesis imperfecta. The hypocalcification type, which is the most common, is an autosomal dominant condition that results in enamel that is not completely mineralized. Consequently, enamel easily flakes off the teeth, which appear yellow because of the revealed dentin. The hypoplastic type is X-linked and results in normal enamel that appears in too little quantity, having the same effect as the most common type.

Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, which can result from erythroblastosis fetalis, is a disease which has numerous effects on an infant, but it can also cause enamel hypoplasia and green staining of enamel.

Enamel hypoplasia is broadly defined to encompass all deviations from normal enamel in its various degrees of absence. The missing enamel could be localized, forming a small pit, or it could be completely absent.

Erythropoietic porphyria is a genetic disease resulting in the deposition of porphyrins throughout the body. These deposits also occur in enamel and leave an appearance described as red in color and fluorescent.

Fluorosis leads to mottled enamel and occurs from overexposure to fluoride.

Tetracycline staining leads to brown bands on the areas of developing enamel. Children up to age 8 can develop mottled enamel from taking tetracycline. As a result, tetracycline is contraindicated in pregnant women.

Celiac disease, a disorder characterized by an auto-immune response to gluten, also commonly results in demineralization of the enamel.

== Other mammals ==

For the most part, research has shown that the formation of tooth enamel in animals is almost identical to formation in humans. The enamel organ, including the dental papilla, and ameloblasts function similarly. The variations of enamel that are present are infrequent but sometimes important. Differences exist, certainly, in the morphology, number, and types of teeth among animals.
Dogs are less likely than humans to have tooth decay due to the high pH of dog saliva, which prevents an acidic environment from forming and the subsequent demineralization of enamel which would occur. If tooth decay does occur (usually from trauma), dogs can receive dental fillings just as humans do. Similar to human teeth, the enamel of dogs is vulnerable to tetracycline staining. Consequently, this risk must be accounted for when tetracycline antibiotic therapy is administered to young dogs. Enamel hypoplasia may also occur in dogs.

The mineral distribution in rodent enamel is different from that of monkeys, dogs, pigs, and humans. In horse teeth, the enamel and dentin layers are intertwined with each other, which increases the strength and wear resistance of those teeth.

== Other organisms ==
Enamel or enameloid is found in the dermal denticles of sharks and many early vertebrates, and it appeared there before gnathostome teeth evolved. The ganoin that covers the scales of many actinopterygians is probably derived from enamel. Enamel-like substances also coat the jaws of some crustacea, but this is not homologous with vertebrate enamel. Enameloid covers some fish scales.

== Mechanical properties ==
Due to the unique structure of enamel, the mechanical properties are very interesting. Enamel is the hardest material in the body and is one of the most durable load-bearing biological materials. It has been shown to have a fracture toughness three times greater than that of geological hydroxyapatite, the main mineral in enamel.

Consisting of rod and interrod regions within the microstructure of enamel, the mechanical properties of enamel vary depending on the location within the microstructure. The rod and interrod structure causes anisotropy in enamel as both components have different mechanical properties. The interrod enamel has around 53% and 74% decreased hardness and elastic modulus when compared to the rod structures. This leads to a composite like hierarchical structure of enamel. The hardness and stiffness parallel to the rod axis results in high hardness and modulus, shown to have modulus values of 85–90 GPa and hardness values of 3.4-3.9 GPa. The hardness and modulus in the direction perpendicular to the rod directions are lower values, shown to have an elastic modulus between 70 and 77 GPa and a hardness value of 3.0-3.5 GPa. The anisotropy between the two directions can be as high as 30%. This is due partially to the structure of the material and the directionality of the rods in the c-direction. The structure of enamel is also composite in nature between the interrod and rods which also leads to anisotropy. Single crystallite hydroxyapatite, the mineral enamel is based on, is also anisotropic. Single crystallite hydroxyapatite has a higher hardness and young&#x27;s modulus, which may be due to the defects present in enamel, such as substitutional ions as well as the presence of organic materials.

The mechanical properties of enamel not only are anisotropic due to the structure of the rods and interrods. They are also varying across the length of enamel from the enamel at the surface of the tooth, the outer enamel, to the junction between the dentin and enamel, DEJ. The elastic modulus increases as the distance between the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) increases within enamel. The fracture toughness is also anisotropic. The fracture toughness can vary by up to a factor of three due to the orientation of the rods. Also in enamel, Cracks do not easily penetrate the dentin, which may lead to the higher fracture toughness. Overall, enamel is a highly anisotropic material due to its microstructure, which leads to properties needed for the effective use of our teeth.

<doc id="314629" wikidata="Q213371" url="?curid=314629" title="Vitreous enamel">
<text>Vitreous enamel, also called porcelain enamel, is a material made by fusing powdered glass to a substrate by firing, usually between . The powder melts, flows, and then hardens to a smooth, durable vitreous coating. The word &quot;vitreous&quot; comes from the Latin , meaning &quot;glassy&quot;.

Enamel can be used on metal, glass, ceramics, stone, or any material that will withstand the fusing temperature. In technical terms fired enamelware is an integrated layered composite of glass and another material (or more glass). The term &quot;enamel&quot; is most often restricted to work on metal, which is the subject of this article. Essentially the same technique used with other bases is known by different terms: on glass as &quot;enamelled glass&quot;, or &quot;painted glass&quot;, and on pottery it is called &quot;overglaze decoration&quot;, &quot;overglaze enamels&quot; or &quot;enamelling&quot;. The craft is called &quot;enamelling&quot;, the artists &quot;enamellers&quot; and the objects produced can be called &quot;enamels&quot;.
Enamelling is an old and widely adopted technology, for most of its history mainly used in jewellery and decorative art. Since the 18th century, enamels have also been applied to many metal consumer objects, such as some cooking vessels, steel sinks, and cast-iron bathtubs. It has also been used on some appliances, such as dishwashers, laundry machines, and refrigerators, and on marker boards and signage.

The term &quot;enamel&quot; has also sometimes been applied to industrial materials other than vitreous enamel, such as enamel paint and the polymers coating enameled wire; these actually are very different in materials science terms.

The word &quot;enamel&quot; comes from the Old High German word (to smelt) via the Old French , or from a Latin word , first found in a 9th-century &quot;Life of Leo IV&quot;. Used as a noun, &quot;an enamel&quot; is usually a small decorative object coated with enamel. &quot;Enamelled&quot; and &quot;enamelling&quot; are the preferred spellings in British English, while &quot;enameled&quot; and &quot;enameling&quot; are preferred in American English.

== History ==
===Ancient===
The earliest enamel all used the cloisonné technique, placing the enamel within small cells with gold walls. This had been used as a technique to hold pieces of stone and gems tightly in place since the 3rd millennium BC, for example in Mesopotamia, and then Egypt. Enamel seems likely to have developed as a cheaper method of achieving similar results.

The earliest undisputed objects known to use enamel are a group of Mycenaean rings from Cyprus, dated to the 13th century BC. Although Egyptian pieces, including jewellery from the Tomb of Tutankhamun of c. 1325 BC, are frequently described as using &quot;enamel&quot;, many scholars doubt the glass paste was sufficiently melted to be properly so described, and use terms such as &quot;glass-paste&quot;. It seems possible that in Egyptian conditions the melting point of the glass and gold were too close to make enamel a viable technique. Nonetheless, there appear to be a few actual examples of enamel, perhaps from the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt (beginning 1070 BC) on. But it remained rare in both Egypt and Greece.

The technique appears in the Koban culture of the northern and central Caucasus, and was perhaps carried by the Sarmatians to the ancient Celts. Red enamel is used in 26 places on the Battersea Shield (c.350–50 BC), probably as an imitation of the red Mediterranean coral, which is used on the Witham Shield (400–300 BC). Pliny the Elder mentions the Celts&#x27; use of the technique on metal, which the Romans in his day hardly knew. The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan is a 2nd-century AD souvenir of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, made for the Roman military market, which has swirling enamel decoration in a Celtic style. In Britain, probably through preserved Celtic craft skills, enamel survived until the hanging bowls of early Anglo-Saxon art.

A problem that adds to the uncertainty over early enamel is artefacts (typically excavated) that appear to have been prepared for enamel, but have now lost whatever filled the cloisons or backing to a champlevé piece. This occurs in several different regions, from ancient Egypt to Anglo-Saxon England. Once enamel becomes more common, as in medieval Europe after about 1000, the assumption that enamel was originally used becomes safer.

===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===

In European art history, enamel was at its most important in the Middle Ages, beginning with the Late Romans and then the Byzantine, who began to use cloisonné enamel in imitation of cloisonné inlays of precious stones. The Byzantine enamel style was widely adopted by the peoples of Migration Period northern Europe. The Byzantines then began to use cloisonné more freely to create images; this was also copied in Western Europe. In Kievan Rus a finift enamel technique was developed.

Mosan metalwork often included enamel plaques of the highest quality in reliquaries and other large works of goldsmithing. Limoges enamel was made in Limoges, France, the most famous centre of vitreous enamel production in Western Europe, though Spain also made a good deal. Limoges became famous for champlevé enamels from the 12th century onwards, producing on a large scale, and then (after a period of reduced production) from the 15th century retained its lead by switching to painted enamel on flat metal plaques. The champlevé technique was considerably easier and very widely practiced in the Romanesque period. In Gothic art the finest work is in basse-taille and ronde-bosse techniques, but cheaper champlevé works continued to be produced in large numbers for a wider market.

Painted enamel remained in fashion for over a century, and in France developed into a sophisticated Renaissance and the Mannerist style, seen on objects such as large display dishes, ewers, inkwells and in small portraits. After it fell from fashion it continued as a medium for portrait miniatures, spreading to England and other countries. This continued until the early 19th century.

A Russian school developed, which used the technique on other objects, as in the Renaissance, and for relatively cheap religious pieces such as crosses and small icons.

===China===

From either Byzantium or the Islamic world, the cloisonné technique reached China in the 13–14th centuries. The first written reference to cloisonné is in a book from 1388, where it is called &quot;Dashi (&#x27;Muslim&#x27;) ware&quot;. No Chinese pieces that are clearly from the 14th century are known; the earliest datable pieces are from the reign of the Xuande Emperor (1425–1435), which, since they show a full use of Chinese styles, suggest considerable experience in the technique.

Cloisonné remained very popular in China until the 19th century and is still produced today. The most elaborate and most highly valued Chinese pieces are from the early Ming dynasty, especially the reigns of the Xuande Emperor and Jingtai Emperor (1450–1457), although 19th century or modern pieces are far more common.

=== Japan ===

Japanese artists did not make three-dimensional enamelled objects until the 1830s but, once the technique took hold based on analysis of Chinese objects, it developed very rapidly, reaching a peak in the Meiji and Taishō eras (late 19th/early 20th century). Enamel had been used as decoration for metalwork since about 1600, and Japanese cloisonné was already exported to Europe before the start of the Meiji era in 1868. Cloisonné is known in Japan as , literally &quot;seven treasures&quot;. This refers to richly coloured substances mentioned in Buddhist texts. The term was initially used for colourful objects imported from China. According to legend, in the 1830s Kaji Tsunekichi broke open a Chinese enamel object to examine it, then trained many artists, starting off Japan&#x27;s own enamel industry.

Early Japanese enamels were cloudy and opaque, with relatively clumsy shapes. This changed rapidly from 1870 onwards. The Nagoya cloisonné company ( existed from 1871 to 1884, to sell the output of many small workshops and help them improve their work. In 1874, the government created the company to sponsor the creation of a wide range of decorative arts at international exhibitions. This was part of a programme to promote Japan as a modern, industrial nation.

Gottfried Wagener was a German scientist brought in by the government to advise Japanese industry and improve production processes. Along with Namikawa Yasuyuki he developed a transparent black enamel which was used for backgrounds. Translucent enamels in various other colours followed during this period. Along with Tsukamoto Kaisuke, Wagener transformed the firing processes used by Japanese workshops, improving the quality of finishes and extending the variety of colours. Kawade Shibatarō introduced a variety of techniques, including (drip-glaze) which produces a rainbow-coloured glaze and (repoussé) technique, in which the metal foundation is hammered outwards to create a relief effect. Together with Hattori Tadasaburō he developed the (&quot;piling up&quot;) technique which places layers of enamel upon each other to create a three-dimensional effect. Namikawa Sōsuke developed a pictorial style that imitated paintings. He is known for (minimised wires) and (wireless cloisonné): techniques developed with Wagener in which the wire are minimised or burned away completely with acid. This contrasts with the Chinese style which used thick metal . Ando Jubei introduced the () technique which burns away the metal substrate to leave translucent enamel, producing an effect resembling stained glass. The Ando Cloisonné Company which he co-founded is one of the few makers from this era still active. Distinctively Japanese designs, in which flowers, birds and insects were used as themes, became popular. Designs also increasingly used areas of blank space. With the greater subtlety these techniques allowed, Japanese enamels were regarded as unequalled in the world and won many awards at national and international exhibitions.

===India and Islamic world===

Enamel was established in the Mughal Empire by around 1600 for decorating gold and silver objects, and became a distinctive feature of Mughal jewellery. The Mughal court was known to employ &quot;mīnākār&quot; (enamelers). These craftsmen reached a peak of during the reign of Shah Jahan in the mid-17th century. Transparent enamels were popular during this time. Both cloissoné and champlevé were produced in Mughal, with champlevé used for the finest pieces. Modern industrial production began in Calcutta in 1921, with the Bengal Enamel Works Limited.

Enamel was used in Iran for colouring and ornamenting the surface of metals by fusing over it brilliant colours that are decorated in an intricate design called Meenakari. The French traveller Jean Chardin, who toured Iran during the Safavid period, made a reference to an enamel work of Isfahan, which comprised a pattern of birds and animals on a floral background in light blue, green, yellow and red. Gold has been used traditionally for Meenakari jewellery as it holds the enamel better, lasts longer and its lustre brings out the colours of the enamels. Silver, a later introduction, is used for artifacts like boxes, bowls, spoons, and art pieces. Copper began to be used for handicraft products after the Gold Control Act, was enforced in India which compelled the Meenakars to look for an alternative material. Initially, the work of Meenakari often went unnoticed as this art was traditionally used on the back of pieces of &quot;kundan&quot; or gem-studded jewellery, allowing pieces to be reversible.

===Modern===

More recently, the bright, jewel-like colours have made enamel popular with jewellery designers, including the Art Nouveau jewellers, for designers of such as the eggs of Peter Carl Fabergé and the enameled copper boxes of the Battersea enamellers, and for artists such as George Stubbs and other painters of portrait miniatures.

Enamel was first applied commercially to sheet iron and steel in Austria and Germany in about 1850. Industrialization increased as the purity of raw materials increased and costs decreased. The wet application process started with the discovery of the use of clay to suspend frit in water. Developments that followed during the 20th century include enamelling-grade steel, cleaned-only surface preparation, automation, and ongoing improvements in efficiency, performance, and quality. 

Between the World Wars, Cleveland in the United States became a center for enamel art, led by Kenneth F. Bates; H. Edward Winter who had taught at the Cleveland School of Art wrote three books on the topic including &quot;Enamel Art on Metals&quot;. In Australia, abstract artist Bernard Hesling brought the style into prominence with his variously sized steel plates, starting in 1957. A resurgence in enamel-based art took place near the end of the 20th century in the Soviet Union, led by artists like Alexei Maximov and Leonid Efros.
== Properties ==
Vitreous enamel can be applied to most metals. Most modern industrial enamel is applied to steel in which the carbon content is controlled to prevent unwanted reactions at the firing temperatures. Enamel can also be applied to gold, silver, copper, aluminium, stainless steel, and cast iron.

Vitreous enamel has many useful properties: it is smooth, hard, chemically resistant, durable, scratch resistant (5–6 on the Mohs scale), has long-lasting colour fastness, is easy to clean, and cannot burn. Enamel is glass, not paint, so it does not fade under ultraviolet light. A disadvantage of enamel is a tendency to crack or shatter when the substrate is stressed or bent, but modern enamels are relatively chip- and impact-resistant because of good thickness control and coefficients of thermal expansion well-matched to the metal.

The Buick automobile company was founded by David Dunbar Buick with wealth earned by his development of improved enamelling processes, c. 1887, for sheet steel and cast iron. Such enameled ferrous material had, and still has, many applications: early 20th century and some modern advertising signs, interior oven walls, cooking pots, housing and interior walls of major kitchen appliances, housing and drums of clothes washers and dryers, sinks and cast iron bathtubs, farm storage silos, and processing equipment such as chemical reactors and pharmaceutical process tanks. Structures such as filling stations, bus stations and Lustron Houses had walls, ceilings and structural elements made of enamelled steel.

One of the most widespread modern uses of enamel is in the production of quality chalk-boards and marker-boards (typically called &#x27;blackboards&#x27; or &#x27;whiteboards&#x27;) where the resistance of enamel to wear and chemicals ensures that &#x27;ghosting&#x27;, or unerasable marks, do not occur, as happens with polymer boards. Since standard enamelling steel is magnetically attractive, it may also be used for magnet boards. Some new developments in the last ten years include enamel/non-stick hybrid coatings, sol-gel functional top-coats for enamels, enamels with a metallic appearance, and easy-to-clean enamels.

The key ingredient of vitreous enamel is finely ground glass called frit. Frit for enamelling steel is typically an alkali borosilicate glass with a thermal expansion and glass temperature suitable for coating steel. Raw materials are smelted together between into a liquid glass that is directed out of the furnace and thermal shocked with either water or steel rollers into frit.

Colour in enamel is obtained by the addition of various minerals, often metal oxides cobalt, praseodymium, iron, or neodymium. The latter creates delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine-red and warm grey. Enamel can be transparent, opaque or opalescent (translucent). Different enamel colours can be mixed to make a new colour, in the manner of paint.

There are various types of frit, which may be applied in sequence. A ground coat is applied first; it usually contains smelted-in transition metal oxides such as cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, and iron that facilitate adhesion to the metal. Next, clear and semi-opaque frits that contain material for producing colours are applied.

== Techniques of artistic enameling ==

The three main historical techniques for enamelling metal are:
* Cloisonné, French for &quot;cell&quot;, where thin wires are applied to form raised barriers, which contain different areas of (subsequently applied) enamel. Widely practiced in Europe, the Middle East and East Asia.
* Champlevé, French for &quot;raised field&quot;, where the surface is carved out to form pits in which enamel is fired, leaving the original metal exposed; the Romanesque Stavelot Triptych is an example.
* Painted enamel, a design in enamel is painted onto a smooth metal surface. Limoges enamel is the best known type of painted enamel, using this from the 16th century onwards. Most traditional painting on glass, and some on ceramics, uses what is technically enamel, but is often described by terms such as &quot;painted in enamels&quot;, reserving &quot;painted enamel&quot; and &quot;enamel&quot; as a term for the whole object for works with a metal base.

Variants, and less common techniques are:
* Basse-taille, from the French word meaning &quot;low-cut&quot;. The surface of the metal is decorated with a low relief design which can be seen through translucent and transparent enamels. The 14th century Royal Gold Cup is an outstanding example.
* Plique-à-jour, French for &quot;open to daylight&quot; where the enamel is applied in cells, similar to cloisonné, but with no backing, so light can shine through the transparent or translucent enamel. It has a stained-glass like appearance; the Mérode Cup is the surviving medieval example.
* Ronde bosse, French for &quot;in the round&quot;, also known as &quot;encrusted enamel&quot;. A 3D type of enamelling where a sculptural form or wire framework is completely or partly enamelled, as in the 15th century Holy Thorn Reliquary.
* Grisaille, version of painted enamel, French term meaning &quot;in grey&quot;, where a dark, often blue or black background is applied, then a palescent (translucent) enamel is painted on top, building up designs in a monochrome gradient, paler as the thickness of the layer of light colour increases.
* En résille (, French for &#x27;enamel in a network on glass&#x27;) where enamelled metal is suspended in glass. The technique was briefly popular in seventeenth-century France and was re-discovered by Margret Craver in 1953. Craver spent 13 years re-creating the technique.
Other types:
* Enamelled glass, in which a glass surface is enamelled, and fired to fuse the glasses.
* Stenciling, where a stencil is placed over the work and the powdered enamel is sifted over the top. The stencil is removed before firing, the enamel staying in a pattern, slightly raised.
* Sgraffito, where an unfired layer of enamel is applied over a previously fired layer of enamel of a contrasting colour, and then partly removed with a tool to create the design.
* Serigraph, where a silkscreen is used with 60–70in grade mesh.
* Surrey enamel, a 17th-century type for brass objects such as candlesticks; effectively champlevé.
* Counter-enamelling, not strictly a technique, but a necessary step in many techniques, especially painted enamel on thin plaques; introduced in 15th-century Europe. Enamel is applied to the back of a piece as well – sandwiching the metal – to equalize the rates of expansion under heat, and so create less tension on the glass so it does not crack.
* Safed chalwan, where jewels are set in white enamel

== Industrial enamel application ==

On sheet steel, a ground coat layer is applied to create adhesion. The only surface preparation required for modern ground coats is degreasing of the steel with a mildly alkaline solution. White and coloured second &quot;cover&quot; coats of enamel are applied over the fired ground coat. For electrostatic enamels, the coloured enamel powder can be applied directly over a thin unfired ground coat &quot;base coat&quot; layer that is co-fired with the cover coat in a very efficient two-coat/one-fire process.

The frit in the ground coat contains smelted-in cobalt and/or nickel oxide as well as other transition metal oxides to catalyse the enamel-steel bonding reactions. During firing of the enamel at between , iron oxide scale first forms on the steel. The molten enamel dissolves the iron oxide and precipitates cobalt and nickel. The iron acts as the anode in an electrogalvanic reaction in which the iron is again oxidised, dissolved by the glass, and oxidised again with the available cobalt and nickel limiting the reaction. Finally, the surface becomes roughened with the glass anchored into the holes.

== Building cladding ==
Enamel coatings applied to steel panels offer protection to the core material whether cladding road tunnels, underground stations, building superstructures or other applications. It can also be specified as a curtain walling. Qualities of this structural material include:
* Durable
* Withstands extreme temperatures and is non-flammable
* Long lasting UV, climate and corrosion resistance
* Dirt-repellent and graffiti-proof
* Resistant to abrasion and chemicals
* Easy cleaning and maintenance

<doc id="314643" wikidata="Q8069042" url="?curid=314643" title="Zendo (game)">
<text>Zendo is a game of inductive logic designed by Kory Heath in which one player (the &quot;Master&quot;) creates a rule for structures (&quot;koans&quot;) to follow, and the other players (the &quot;Students&quot;) try to discover it by building and studying various koans which follow or break the rule. The first student to correctly state the rule wins.

&quot;Zendo&quot; can be compared to the card game &quot;Eleusis&quot; and the chess variant &quot;Penultima&quot; in which players attempt to discover inductively a secret rule thought of by one or more players (called &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Nature&quot; in &quot;Eleusis&quot; and &quot;Spectators&quot; in &quot;Penultima&quot;) who declare plays legal or illegal on the basis of their rules. It can also be compared to Petals Around the Rose, a similar inductive reasoning puzzle where the &quot;secret rule&quot; is always the same.

The game can be played with any set of colorful playing pieces, and has been sold with a set of 60 Icehouse pyramids in red, yellow, green, and blue, 60 glass stones and a small deck of cards containing simple rules for beginners. The Icehouse pieces were replaced in the second edition with blocks, single size pyramids and wedges. Origami pyramids are a common choice of playing piece.

==History==
The rules were published in 2001 after more than a year of playtests and changes. In 2004, the Zendo boxed set won &quot;Best Abstract Board Game of 2003&quot; at the Origins Awards. In 2005, the set won the Mensa Select Game Award. &quot;Zendo&quot; is also published in Looney Labs&#x27; &quot;Playing with Pyramids&quot;, a book of rules and strategies for a dozen popular games playable with &quot;Icehouse&quot; pieces.

In December 2017, the company reissued &quot;Zendo&quot; game separate from the Looney pyramids line for the first time. The Icehouse pyramids were replaced by blocks, single size pyramids and wedges. Buddhist terminology were also removed from the instructions. In August 2018, &quot;Zendo Rules Expansion&quot; #1 was released, adding 10 rule cards to the game.

==Gameplay==
Within Zendo, most players are known as Students, who will build structures of pieces known as koans. Before play, one player (known as the Master) will invent a secret Rule, such as &quot;a koan has the Buddha-nature if and only if it contains one or more green pieces&quot;. The Master then builds two koans - one which follows the rule and one which does not. These are marked with a white and black stone respectively.

Students then take turns to build koans. After building a koan, a student may call either &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Mondo&quot;:

*Master: The Master determines whether that Student&#x27;s koan follows or breaks the Rule (also stylized as: &quot;possesses or lacks the Buddha-nature&quot;, in fitting with the game&#x27;s philosophical theme) and marks it with a white or black stone accordingly.
*Mondo: Each Student guesses whether the koan follows or breaks the rule, by holding a black or white stone in their hand. The Master marks whether the koan follows the rule, and stones are revealed simultaneously: Students who guessed correctly are awarded a Guessing Stone.

At the end of their turn, a Student may spend Guessing Stones to guess the Master&#x27;s Rule. If the guess is wrong, the Master may build and mark a new koan (which either fits the Master&#x27;s Rule but not the Student&#x27;s guess, or vice versa) to prove this. The first student to correctly state the rule wins that round and becomes the new Master.

== Philosophy of play ==
Zendo encourages inductive reasoning and scientific thinking due to the nature of the guessing process. Players are encouraged to think critically while playing the game.

Although it is possible to &#x27;win&#x27; Zendo by correctly stating a rule, there are no losers. Every player benefits from observing and following play. Furthermore, Masters may &#x27;win&#x27; as well, by choosing a challenging, yet simple Rule.

== Koan attributes ==

Pieces tend to be objects with multiple discrete distinguishing attributes; for example, Icehouse pieces, folded paper pyramids or Lego blocks. Using these, it is possible to create many different parts inside a koan. A partial list of koan attributes is below.
# Size of pieces
# Shape of pieces
# Color of pieces
# Number of pieces
# Relative orientation (&quot;pointing at another piece/parallel to another piece&quot;) of pieces
# Groundedness (pieces supported entirely by other pieces are not &quot;grounded&quot;) of pieces

== Awards ==
* &quot;Zendo&quot; won the 2003 Origins Award for &quot;Abstract Board Game&quot;.
* &quot;Zendo&quot; was named one of the 2005 Mensa Select games by American Mensa.

<text>The Strand (commonly referred to with a leading &quot;The&quot;, but formally without) is a major street in the City of Westminster, Central London. The street, which is part of London&#x27;s West End theatreland, runs just over from Trafalgar Square eastwards to Temple Bar, where it becomes Fleet Street in the City of London, and is part of the A4, a main road running west from inner London.

The road&#x27;s name comes from the Old English &quot;strond&quot;, meaning the beach or edge of a river, as it historically ran alongside the north bank of the River Thames. The river side of the street was home to grand houses, interspersed with slum alleys, between the 12th and 17th centuries. Historically important mansions built between the Strand and the river included Essex House, Arundel House, Old Somerset House, Savoy Palace, Durham House, York House and Cecil House, none of which survive. The aristocracy moved to the West End during the 17th century, and the Strand became known for its coffee shops, restaurants and taverns. The street was a centre point for theatre and music hall during the 19th century, and several venues have survived to the current day. 

At the east end of the street are two English Baroque churches: St Mary le Strand by James Gibbs and St Clement Danes by Christopher Wren. This easternmost stretch of the Strand is also home to King&#x27;s College, one of the two founding colleges of the University of London. Other notable structures include the Royal Courts of Justice and Australia House.

Several authors, poets and philosophers have lived on or near the Strand, including Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Virginia Woolf.

==Geography==
The street is the main link between the two cities of Westminster and London. It runs eastward from Trafalgar Square, parallel to the River Thames, to Temple Bar which is the boundary between the two cities at this point; the road ahead being Fleet Street. Traffic travelling eastbound follows a short crescent around Aldwych, connected at both ends to the Strand. The road marks the southern boundary of the Covent Garden district and forms part of the Northbank business improvement district.

The name was first recorded in 1002 as &quot;strondway&quot;, then in 1185 as &quot;Stronde&quot; and in 1220 as &quot;la Stranda&quot;. It is formed from the Old English word &#x27;strond&#x27;, meaning the edge of a river. Initially it referred to the shallow bank of the once much wider Thames, before the construction of the Victoria Embankment. The name was later applied to the road itself. In the 13th century it was known as &#x27;Densemanestret&#x27; or &#x27;street of the Danes&#x27;, referring to the community of Danes in the area.

Two London Underground stations were once named Strand: a Piccadilly line station (which was renamed Aldwych station) that operated between 1907 and 1994 and a former Northern line station which today forms part of Charing Cross station. &#x27;Strand Bridge&#x27; was the name given to Waterloo Bridge during its construction; it was renamed for its official opening on the second anniversary of the coalition victory in the Battle of Waterloo. London buses routes 23, 139 and 176 all run along the Strand, as do numerous night bus services.

==History==

During Roman Britain, what is now the Strand was part of the route to Silchester, known as &quot;Iter VIII&quot; on the Antonine Itinerary, and which later became known by the name Akeman Street. It was briefly part of a trading town called Lundenwic that developed around 600 AD, and stretched from Trafalgar Square to Aldwych. Alfred the Great gradually moved the settlement into the old Roman town of Londinium from around 886 AD onwards, leaving no mark of the old town, and the area returned to fields.

In the Middle Ages, the Strand became the principal route between the separate settlements of the City of London (the civil and commercial centre) and the royal Palace of Westminster (the national political centre). In the archaeological record, there is considerable evidence of occupation to the north of Aldwych, but much along the former foreshore has been covered by rubble from the demolition of the Tudor Somerset Place, a former royal residence, to create a large platform for the building of the first Somerset House, in the 17th century. The landmark Eleanor&#x27;s Cross was built in the 13th century at the western end of the Strand at Charing Cross by Edward I commemorating his wife Eleanor of Castile. It was demolished in 1647 by the request of Parliament during the First English Civil War, but reconstructed in 1865.

The west part of the Strand was in the parish of St Martin in the Fields and in the east it extended into the parishes of St Clement Danes and St Mary le Strand. Most of its length was in the Liberty of Westminster, although part of the eastern section in St Clement Danes was in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex. The Strand was the northern boundary of the precinct of the Savoy, which was approximately where the approach to Waterloo Bridge is now. All of these parishes and places became part of the Strand District in 1855, except St Martin in the Fields which was governed separately. The Strand District Board of Works was based at No. 22, Tavistock Street. Strand District was abolished in October 1900 and became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.

===Palaces===
From the 12th century onwards, large mansions lined the Strand including several palaces and townhouses inhabited by bishops and royal courtiers, mainly on the south side, with their own river gates and landings directly on the Thames. The road was poorly maintained, with many pits and sloughs, and a paving order was issued in 1532 to improve traffic.

What later became Essex House on the Strand was originally an Outer Temple of the Knights Templar in the 11th century. In 1313, ownership passed to the Knights of St John. Henry VIII gave the house to William, Baron Paget in the early 16th century. Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, rebuilt the house in 1563, originally calling it Leicester House. It was renamed Essex House after being inherited by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, in 1588. It was demolished around 1674 and Essex Street, leading up to the Strand, was built on the location by property speculator Nicholas Barbon.

Arundel House was originally the town house of the Bishops of Bath and Wells. It was owned by William FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Southampton between 1539 and his death in 1542, with ownership passing to Thomas Seymour in 1545. After Seymour was executed in 1549, the property was sold to Henry FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, and was owned by the Earldom for much of the 16th and 17th century. In 1666, it became the meeting place of the Royal Society after the Great Fire of London destroyed their previous venue. The house was demolished in 1678 and Arundel Street, adjoining the Strand, was built on the site.
Somerset House was built by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, regent of England from 1547 to 1549, demolishing three inns and the church of the Nativity of Our Lady and the Innocents in the process. After Somerset was executed in 1552, it became an occasional residence for Princess Elizabeth. When she became Queen in 1558, she returned part of the house to Seymour&#x27;s family (with ownership passing to his son, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford); the remainder was an occasional meeting place for the Royal Society. After Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1603, it was owned by Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI and I. The building was renamed Denmark House in commemoration of Anne&#x27;s brother, Christian IV of Denmark. After James died in 1625, his body lay there intestate for a month. The building was taken over by Parliament in 1645 following the Civil War, renaming it back to Somerset House. It had an irregular series of owners and residents for much of the 18th century until it was demolished in 1775. The house was rebuilt as a series of government buildings. The Stamp Office, later to become the Inland Revenue was established in Somerset House in 1789. In the late 20th century, a number of art galleries were set up on vacant parts, including the Courtauld Institute of Art and the King&#x27;s College London School of Law.
Savoy Palace was the London residence of John of Gaunt, King Richard II&#x27;s uncle and the nation&#x27;s power broker. In the 14th century the Savoy was the most magnificent nobleman&#x27;s mansion in England. During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, rebels, led by Wat Tyler, inflamed by opposition to the poll tax promoted by John of Gaunt, systematically demolished the Savoy and everything in it. In 1512 it was rebuilt as the Savoy Hospital for the poor. It gradually fell into dereliction and was divided into multiple tenancies. It was demolished in 1816–1820 to build the approach road to Waterloo Bridge. eventually being demolished in the 19th century. The Savoy Hotel now occupies this site.
Durham House, the historic London residence of the Bishop of Durham, was built circa 1345 and demolished in the mid-17th century. It was the home of Anne Boleyn. It had become derelict by the mid-17th century and was demolished in 1660. Durham Street and the Adelphi Buildings were built on its site.

York House was built as the London residence for the Bishop of Norwich not later than 1237. At the time of the Reformation it was acquired by King Henry VIII and came to be known as York House when he granted it to the Archbishop of York in 1556. In the 1620s it was acquired by the royal favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and after an interlude during the Civil War it was returned to George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who sold it to developers in 1672. It was then demolished and new streets and buildings built on the site, including George Street, Villiers Street, Duke Street, Of Alley, and Buckingham Street.

Cecil House, also called Exeter House or Burghley House, was built in the 16th century by Lord Burghley as an expansion of an existing Tudor house. Exeter House was demolished in 1676 and Exeter Exchange built on the site. A menagerie was built on the upper floors in 1773, which was later run by Edward Cross, who housed lions, tigers, monkeys and hippopotami. In 1826, an elephant, Chunee, nearly broke free from its cage and had to be destroyed; the skeleton was later put on display. The exchange was demolished in 1829, with the menagerie moving to the Surrey Zoological Gardens, and replaced by Exeter Hall, noted for its Evangelical meetings. This was demolished in 1907, and the site is now occupied by the Strand Palace Hotel.

Other significant palaces along the Strand include Worcester House, formerly the Inn, or residence, of the Bishop of Carlisle, Salisbury House, used for royal lodgings in the 15th and 16th centuries, Bedford House demolished in 1704, Hungerford House, which was demolished and replaced, in turn, by Hungerford Market and Charing Cross station and Northumberland House, a large Jacobean mansion, the historic London residence of the Dukes of Northumberland; built in 1605 and demolished in 1874. Northumberland Avenue now occupies the site. The official residence of the Secretary of State, next door at No. 1 the Strand, became the first numbered address in London.

Apart from the rebuilt Somerset House, all of these buildings have been demolished and replaced from the 17th century onwards. A New Exchange was built on part of the gardens of Durham House, in 1608–1609, facing the Strand. This high-class shopping centre enjoyed considerable popularity but was eventually destroyed in 1737.

===Modern era===

During the 17th century, many of the grand mansions on the Strand were demolished as the aristocracy moved to the West End. The Duck and Drake tavern on Strand was famed as a venue for the conspirators involved in the Gunpowder Plot. In the time of the Civil War, the Nag&#x27;s Head tavern was the venue of a meeting between Henry Ireton and some of the Levellers which resulted in the production of &quot;Remonstrance of the Army&quot;, demanding the abolition of the monarchy and the trial of King Charles I.

In the 18th century, coffee and chop houses were established on the street; Twinings was established at No. 206 in 1706 by Thomas Twining, supplier of tea to Queen Anne. The company claims to be the oldest ratepayer in Westminster. The Grecian Coffee House ran from around 1702 to 1803, while Tom&#x27;s ran from 1706 to around 1775. Though these premises were well-known, the alleyways around the Strand were regular haunts for pickpockets and prostitutes during this time. The Rose Tavern, at the eastern end of the street, was frequented by lawyers during the 18th century. It was later demolished and became Thanet Place. The Crown and Anchor in Arundel Street was the main meeting place for the Catholic Association, and helped established the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. It was later used for Catholic politicians such as Daniel O&#x27;Connell to address constituents. The original premises burned down in 1854, but was rebuilt. Simpson&#x27;s-in-the-Strand originally started at No. 100 in 1828 as a smoking and dining club. It later became a restaurant. The Strand was also notable in the 18th century as a centre for the British book trade, with numerous printers and publishers along the street. The prominent bookseller Andrew Millar is an example of one of the most successful publishers who owned a shop there.

In the 19th century, much of the Strand was rebuilt, and the houses to the south no longer backed onto the Thames and no longer had direct boat access, separated from the river by the Victoria Embankment constructed in 1865–1870 and reclaiming of land. King&#x27;s College, London was founded in 1828. The historic King&#x27;s Building, based next to the church of St Mary-le-Strand, was designed by Robert Smirke and constructed in 1829–1831 to complete the riverside frontage of Somerset House. King&#x27;s College Hospital opened as a branch of the college in 1840, and became a constituent part of the University of London in 1908. The current campus building was constructed between 1966 and 1972 by E.D. Jefferiss Mathews. In 2015, the college acquired Strand House, Bush House and other buildings in the Aldwych Quarter. The Royal Courts of Justice, at the eastern end of the Strand, was designed in the mid-1860s by G.E. Street as a replacement for the older courts at Westminster Hall, though construction was so delayed that he died shortly before Queen Victoria opened the courts in 1882. The West Green extension to the courts opened in 1911, while the Queen&#x27;s Building opened in 1968.
The architect John Nash redeveloped the western end of the Strand in the 1830s, including the construction of Charing Cross Hospital, later (1990s) converted for use as Charing Cross police station.

The street became well known for theatres, and at one point contained more than any other; including the Tivoli Music Hall at No. 65, the Adelphi, Gaiety, Savoy, Terry&#x27;s and Vaudeville. In the 21st century, only the Adelphi, Vaudeville and Savoy remain. The Piccadilly branch line from Holborn to Aldwych was built partly to serve theatre traffic. 

The Coal Hole tavern was founded at No. 91 in the early 19th century, and frequented by coal-heavers working on the Thames. The impresario Renton Nicholson held song-and-supper evenings at the inn, featuring tableaux vivants. The actor Edmund Kean established the Wolf Club at the venue, which is now commemorated by the Wolf Room.

Charing Cross railway station was built on the Strand in 1864, providing a boat train service to Europe, which stimulated the growth of hotels in the area to cater for travellers. These included the Charing Cross Hotel, attached to the station itself. Today, there are several luggage outlets and tourist agents on the Strand, as well as old postage stamp dealers. The philatelist Stanley Gibbons opened a shop at No. 435 in 1891. It moved to No. 391 in 1893, and is now currently based at No. 399.

The Strand Palace Hotel was designed by F.J.Wills and constructed in 1925–1930. The entrance was rebuilt in 1968, with the original being moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Strand underwent extensive redevelopment in the mid-20th century. The length of road from St Mary&#x27;s eastwards up to St Clement&#x27;s was widened in 1900, subsuming the former Holywell Street which forked from the Strand and ran parallel with it to the north, leaving the two churches of St Mary Le Strand and St Clement Danes as islands in the centre of the road. Gaiety Theatre was demolished, to be replaced by Citibank House, while Villiers House and New South Wales House were both built in 1957–1959. New South Wales House was subsequently demolished in 1996 and replaced by an office block. In 1998, a statue of Oscar Wilde was built at the junction of Adelaide Street and Duncannon Street, adjoining the western end of the Strand.

Between January 2021 and December 2022 Westminster City Council&#x27;s Strand Aldwych Scheme works took place, pedestrianising Strand between Melbourne Place and Lancaster Place whilst Aldwych was converted into a two-way street.

==Churches==

The church of St Clement Danes is believed to date from the 9th century. The name may have come from Harold Harefoot, a Danish king who ruled England around 1035–1040 and is buried in the church, or from a place of refuge for Danes after the conquest of Alfred the Great. It was transferred to the Order of the Knights Templar by Henry II in 1189. It survived the Great Fire in 1666, but was declared unsafe and rebuilt by Christopher Wren in 1679. The building was damaged during the Blitz in 1941, gutting much of the interior, and was rebuilt in 1958 by Sam Lloyd, since when it has served as the central church of the Royal Air Force. The church is one of two possible origins for the &quot;St Clement&#x27;s&quot; in the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;, though more contemporary accounts suggest St Clement&#x27;s, Eastcheap in the City of London to be more likely.

St Mary le Strand was designed by James Gibbs and completed in 1717, to replace a previous church demolished to make way for Somerset House. It was the first building to be designed by Gibbs, who was influenced by Wren and Michelangelo. The column on top of the church was originally designed to support a statue of Queen Anne, but was replaced with a spire following Anne&#x27;s death in 1714. It survived the Blitz but was in poor shape until John Betjeman led a campaign to restore it in the 1970s. Essex Street Chapel, the birthplace of British Unitarianism, abuts onto the Strand. The original chapel was built in 1774, but damaged in the Blitz. It was restored after the war, and now serves as the denominational headquarters of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches.

==Notable residents==
The print seller Rudolph Ackermann lived and worked at No. 101 The Strand between 1797 and 1827. His shop was one of the first to have gas lighting fitted.

In the 19th century, The Strand became a newly fashionable address and many avant-garde writers and thinkers gathered here, among them Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens, John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson and the scientist Thomas Henry Huxley. No. 142 was the home of radical publisher and physician John Chapman, who published contemporary authors from this house during the 1850s and edited the journal &quot;Westminster Review&quot; from 1851. George Eliot lived at No. 142 between 1851 and 1855. Virginia Woolf regularly travelled along the Strand, and a King&#x27;s College building named after her is in nearby Kingsway.

==Cultural references==
The Strand is the subject of a famous music hall song &quot;Let&#x27;s All Go Down the Strand&quot;, composed by Harry Castling and C. W. Murphy. The song opens with a group of tourists staying the night at Trafalgar Square while about to embark for the Rhineland. The chorus of &quot;Let&#x27;s all go down the Strand – have a banana&quot; is now recognised as a stereotypical part of Cockney music hall and parodied by English comedian Bill Bailey. John Betjeman used the title of the song for a television documentary made for Associated-Rediffusion in 1967. The same year, Margaret Williams used it for a stage comedy. Australian-born composer Percy Grainger used the name for his 1911 piano trio &quot;Handel in the Strand&quot;.

Virginia Woolf wrote about the Strand in several of her essays, including &quot;Street Haunting: A London Adventure,&quot; and the novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;. T. S. Eliot alluded to the Strand in his 1905 poem &quot;At Graduation&quot; and in his 1922 poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (part III, The Fire Sermon, v. 258: &quot;and along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street&quot;). John Masefield also referred to a &quot;jostling in the Strand&quot; in his poem &quot;On Growing Old&quot;. The poem &quot;Buses on the Strand&quot;, written in 1958 by Richard Percival Lister, featured in TFL&#x27;s &quot;Poems on the Underground&quot; scheme in 2013, appearing in tube carriages all over London. The scheme celebrated of the 150th year of the London Underground with works by poets with close London connections.

&quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, which began publishing in 1891, was named after the street. A BBC World Service arts and culture radio series was called &quot;The Strand&quot;. Bush House, situated on the Strand, was home to the World Service between 1941 and 2012.

The standard British &quot;Monopoly&quot; board has Strand in a group with the nearby Fleet Street and Trafalgar Square.

<text>GROningen MOlecular Simulation (GROMOS) is the name of a force field for molecular dynamics simulation, and a related computer software package. Both are developed at the University of Groningen, and at the Computer-Aided Chemistry Group at the Laboratory for Physical Chemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich). At Groningen, Herman Berendsen was involved in its development.

The united atom force field was optimized with respect to the condensed phase properties of alkanes.

== Versions ==

=== GROMOS87 ===
Aliphatic and aromatic hydrogen atoms were included implicitly by representing the carbon atom and attached hydrogen atoms as one group centered on the carbon atom, a united atom force field. The van der Waals force parameters were derived from calculations of the crystal structures of hydrocarbons, and on amino acids using short (0.8 nm) nonbonded cutoff radii.

=== GROMOS96 ===
In 1996, a substantial rewrite of the software package was released. The force field was also improved, e.g., in the following way: aliphatic CHn groups were represented as united atoms with van der Waals interactions reparametrized on the basis of a series of molecular dynamics simulations of model liquid alkanes using long (1.4 nm) nonbonded cutoff radii. This version is continually being refined and several different parameter sets are available. GROMOS96 includes studies of molecular dynamics, stochastic dynamics, and energy minimization. The energy component was also part of the prior GROMOS, named GROMOS87. GROMOS96 was planned and conceived during a time of 20 months. The package is made of 40 different programs, each with a different essential function. An example of two important programs within the GROMOS96 are PROGMT, in charge of constructing molecular topology and also PROPMT, changing the classical molecular topology into the path-integral molecular topology.

=== GROMOS05 ===
An updated version of the software package was introduced in 2005.

=== GROMOS11 ===
The current GROMOS release is dated in May 2011.

== Parameter sets ==
Some of the force field parameter sets that are based on the GROMOS force field. The A-version applies to aqueous or apolar solutions of proteins, nucleotides, and sugars. The B-version applies to isolated molecules (gas phase).

=== 54 ===
* 54A7 - 53A6 taken and adjusted torsional angle terms to better reproduce helical propensities, altered N–H, C=O repulsion, new CH3 charge group, parameterisation of Na+ and Cl− to improve free energy of hydration and new improper dihedrals.
* 54B7 - 53B6 &quot;in vacuo&quot; taken and changed in same manner as 53A6 to 54A7.

=== 53 ===
* 53A5 - optimised by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane, is an expansion and renumbering of 45A3.
* 53A6 - 53A5 taken and adjusted partial charges to reproduce hydration free enthalpies in water, recommended for simulations of biomolecules in explicit water.

=== 45 ===
* 45A3 - suitable to apply to lipid aggregates such as membranes and micelles, for mixed systems of aliphatics with or without water, for polymers, and other apolar systems that may interact with different biomolecules.
* 45A4 - 45A3 reparameterised to improve DNA representation.

=== 43 ===
* 43A1
* 43A2

<doc id="314650" wikidata="Q2386424" url="?curid=314650" title="Enamel paint">
<text>Enamel paint is paint that air-dries to a hard, usually glossy, finish, used for coating surfaces that are outdoors or otherwise subject to hard wear or variations in temperature; it should not be confused with decorated objects in &quot;painted enamel&quot;, where vitreous enamel is applied with brushes and fired in a kiln. The name is something of a misnomer, as in reality most commercially available enamel paints are significantly softer than either vitreous enamel or stoved synthetic resins, and are totally different in composition; vitreous enamel is applied as a powder or paste and then fired at high temperature. There is no generally accepted definition or standard for use of the term &quot;enamel paint&quot;, and not all enamel-type paints may use it.

==Paint==
Typically the term &quot;enamel paint&quot; is used to describe oil-based covering products, usually with a significant amount of gloss in them, however recently many latex or water-based paints have adopted the term as well. The term today means &quot;hard surfaced paint&quot; and usually is in reference to paint brands of higher quality, floor coatings of a high gloss finish, or spray paints. Most enamel paints are alkyd resin based. Some enamel paints have been made by adding varnish to oil-based paint.

Although &quot;enamels&quot; and &quot;painted enamel&quot; in art normally refer to vitreous enamel, in the 20th century some artists used commercial enamel paints in art, including Pablo Picasso (mixing it with oil paint), Hermann-Paul, Jackson Pollock, and Sidney Nolan. &quot;The Trial&quot; (1947) is one of a number of works by Nolan to use enamel paint, usually Ripolin, a commercial paint not intended for art, also Picasso&#x27;s usual brand. Some &quot;enamel paints&quot; are now produced specifically for artists.

Enamels paints can also refer to nitrocellulose based paints, one of the first modern commercial paints of the 20th century. They have since been superseded by new synthetic coatings like alkyd, acrylic and vinyl, due to toxicity, safety, and conservation (tendency to age yellow) concerns. In art has been used also by Pollock with the commercial paint named Duco. The artist experimented and created with many types of commercial or house paints during his career. Other artists: &quot;after discovering various types of industrial materials produced in the United States in the 1930s, Siqueiros&#x27; produced most of his easel works with uncommon materials which include Duco paint, a DuPont brand name for pyroxyline paint, a tough and resilient type of nitro-cellulose paint manufactured for the automotive industry&quot;. Nitro-cellulose enamels are also commonly known as modern lacquers. Enamel paint comes in a variety of hues and can be custom blended to produce a particular tint. It is also available in water-based and solvent-based formulations, with solvent-based enamel being more prevalent in industrial applications. For the greatest results, use a high-quality brush, roller, or spray gun when applying enamel paint. When dried, enamel paint forms a durable, hard-wearing surface that resists chipping, fading, and discoloration, making it a great choice for a wide range of surfaces and applications.

==Uses and categories==
*Floor enamel – May be used for concrete, stairs, basements, porches, and patios.
*Fast dry enamel – Can dry within 10–15 minutes of application. Ideal for refrigerators, counters, and other industrial finishes.
*High-temp enamel – May be used for engines, brake calipers, exhaust pipe and BBQs.
*Enamel paint is also used on wood to make it resistant to the elements via the waterproofing and rotproofing properties of enamel. Generally, treated surfaces last much longer and are much more resistant to wear than untreated surfaces.
*Model building – Xtracolor and Humbrol are mainstream UK brands. Colourcoats model paint is a high quality brand with authentic accurate military colours. Testors, a US company, offers the Floquil, Pactra, Model Master and Testors brands.
*Nail enamel – to color nails, it comes in many varieties for fast drying, color retention, gloss retention, etc.
*Epoxy enamel, polyurethane enamel, etc. used in protective coating / industrial painting purpose in chemical and petrochemical industries for anti-corrosion purposes.

<doc id="314651" wikidata="Q1691427" url="?curid=314651" title="Joe Fulks">
<text>Joseph Franklin &quot;Jumping Joe&quot; Fulks (October 26, 1921 – March 21, 1976) was an American professional basketball player. The NBA&#x27;s first scoring champion, he was sometimes called &quot;the first of the high-scoring forwards&quot;. He was posthumously enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978.

==Early life==
Fulks was born on a farm outside of Birmingham, Kentucky, a small town in the state&#x27;s far-western Purchase region. Due to his family&#x27;s low income, Fulks did not own a real basketball in his youth, instead practicing with a tin can or a stuffed sock until a local high school coach gifted him a used ball.

Fulks began his high school career for Birmingham High School, becoming a star player for the team. Following his junior season, he moved with his family to Kuttawa, Kentucky. This move preempted the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s damming of the Tennessee River, which flooded Birmingham under Kentucky Lake. Kuttawa was accused of recruiting Fulks to their basketball team by securing his father a job at the local prison, but an investigation by the Kentucky High School Association Board of Control did not find enough evidence to punish the school.

==College career==
He played college ball at Murray State University (then known as Murray State Teachers College) for two years before leaving school to join the Marines in May 1942. He served with 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines during World War II, and was discharged as a corporal in May 1946. His number 26 hangs in the rafters at Murray State&#x27;s CFSB Center.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Warriors (1946–1954)===
Fulks joined the BAA&#x27;s Philadelphia Warriors in 1946, at age 25, and as a rookie won the league&#x27;s first scoring title with a 23.2 points per game average as the Warriors won the BAA title. Fulks again led the league&#x27;s in scoring average during the 1947–48 season at 22.1 points per game, but lost the scoring title to Max Zaslofsky, who had more total points. Fulks had a career best 26.0 points per game average in the 1948–49 season. Fulks led the NBA in free throw percentage during the 1950–51 season.

Fulks set the BAA/NBA single game scoring record four different times. On December 3, 1946, in just his eighth game as a professional, Fulks became the league&#x27;s record holder for most points scored in a single game when he scored 37 points, making 16 field goals and five free throws, in Philadelphia&#x27;s 76–68 win over the Providence Steam Rollers. Just 20 games later on January 14, 1947, Fulks set a new single game scoring record when he scored 41 points, making 15 field goals and 11 free throws, in Philadelphia&#x27;s 104–74 win over the Toronto Huskies. In the 1946–47 season, Fulks also led the league in scoring for its inaugural season, scoring 23.2 points per game. Two seasons later, on December 18, 1948, Fulks tied Carl Braun&#x27;s single game scoring record when he scored 47 points, making 18 field goals and 11 free throws, in Philadelphia&#x27;s 94–90 win against the Providence Steamrollers.

For the fourth and final time, Fulks set a new single-game scoring record when he scored 63 points on February 10, 1949. It remained the most in an NBA game until Elgin Baylor scored 64 points in a 1959 game. Fulks&#x27; 63-point outburst came during a Warriors 108–87 victory over the Indianapolis Jets. Fulks made 27 of 56 field goal attempts and nine of 14 free throws. Along the way he shattered the record for most points in one half (33), field goals, and field goal attempts. Two seasons after his 63-point game, on January 4, 1951, Fulks grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds, alongside scoring 20 points, in a 92–69 win over the Baltimore Bullets.

The 6&#x27;5&quot; (1.96 m) Fulks was known both for his athletic drives to the basket as well as his shooting. He was perhaps most remembered as one of the pioneers of the modern jump shot. During his early career, Fulks was considered the league&#x27;s greatest offensive player. In his first three seasons, Fulks averaged 23.9 points per game at a time when, before the advent of the shot-clock, teams rarely scored over 70 points in a game. Fulks was named to the All-BAA First Team during his first three seasons. In 1971, he was one of 25 players named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team. However, indicative of his era, Fulks was a low-efficiency shooter, holding the 18th-worst career field goal percentage in NBA history for players who attempted at least 1,000 shots, making only 30.2% of the shots he attempted. He holds the record for missed shots in a game, in both the regular season and playoffs.

==Later life and death==
Upon his retirement, Fulks returned to Marshall County, Kentucky, where he lived the remainder of his life. He worked at the Kentucky State Penitentiary as the prison recreation director. Fulks was shot and killed on March 21, 1976, by Gregg Bannister, the son of his girlfriend, Roberta Bannister, during an argument over a handgun. A jury found Bannister guilty of reckless homicide and he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. Fulks was buried in Briensburg, Kentucky.

<doc id="314652" wikidata="Q1136640" url="?curid=314652" title="Square wave">
<text>A square wave is a non-sinusoidal periodic waveform in which the amplitude alternates at a steady frequency between fixed minimum and maximum values, with the same duration at minimum and maximum. In an ideal square wave, the transitions between minimum and maximum are instantaneous. 

The square wave is a special case of a pulse wave which allows arbitrary durations at minimum and maximum amplitudes. The ratio of the high period to the total period of a pulse wave is called the duty cycle. A true square wave has a 50% duty cycle (equal high and low periods).

Square waves are often encountered in electronics and signal processing, particularly digital electronics and digital signal processing. Its stochastic counterpart is a two-state trajectory.

== Origin and uses ==

Square waves are universally encountered in digital switching circuits and are naturally generated by binary (two-level) logic devices. They are used as timing references or &quot;clock signals&quot;, because their fast transitions are suitable for triggering synchronous logic circuits at precisely determined intervals. However, as the frequency-domain graph shows, square waves contain a wide range of harmonics; these can generate electromagnetic radiation or pulses of current that interfere with other nearby circuits, causing noise or errors. To avoid this problem in very sensitive circuits such as precision analog-to-digital converters, sine waves are used instead of square waves as timing references.

In musical terms, they are often described as sounding hollow, and are therefore used as the basis for wind instrument sounds created using subtractive synthesis. They also make up the &quot;beeping&quot; alerts used in many household, commercial, and industrial contexts. Additionally, the distortion effect used on electric guitars clips the outermost regions of the waveform, causing it to increasingly resemble a square wave as more distortion is applied.

Simple two-level Rademacher functions are square waves.

== Definitions ==

The square wave in mathematics has many definitions, which are equivalent except at the discontinuities:

It can be defined as simply the sign function of a sinusoid:
formula_1
which will be 1 when the sinusoid is positive, −1 when the sinusoid is negative, and 0 at the discontinuities. Here, &quot;T&quot; is the period of the square wave and &quot;f&quot; is its frequency, which are related by the equation &quot;f&quot; = 1/&quot;T&quot;.

A square wave can also be defined with respect to the Heaviside step function &quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) or the rectangular function Π(&quot;t&quot;):
formula_2

A square wave can also be generated using the floor function directly:
formula_3
and indirectly:
formula_4

Using the fourier series (below) one can show that the floor function may be written in trigonometric form
formula_5

== Fourier analysis ==


Using Fourier expansion with cycle frequency over time , an ideal square wave with an amplitude of 1 can be represented as an infinite sum of sinusoidal waves:
formula_6

The ideal square wave contains only components of odd-integer harmonic frequencies (of the form ).

A curiosity of the convergence of the Fourier series representation of the square wave is the Gibbs phenomenon. Ringing artifacts in non-ideal square waves can be shown to be related to this phenomenon. The Gibbs phenomenon can be prevented by the use of σ-approximation, which uses the Lanczos sigma factors to help the sequence converge more smoothly.

An ideal mathematical square wave changes between the high and the low state instantaneously, and without under- or over-shooting. This is impossible to achieve in physical systems, as it would require infinite bandwidth.

Square waves in physical systems have only finite bandwidth and often exhibit ringing effects similar to those of the Gibbs phenomenon or ripple effects similar to those of the σ-approximation.

For a reasonable approximation to the square-wave shape, at least the fundamental and third harmonic need to be present, with the fifth harmonic being desirable. These bandwidth requirements are important in digital electronics, where finite-bandwidth analog approximations to square-wave-like waveforms are used. (The ringing transients are an important electronic consideration here, as they may go beyond the electrical rating limits of a circuit or cause a badly positioned threshold to be crossed multiple times.)

== Characteristics of imperfect square waves ==

As already mentioned, an ideal square wave has instantaneous transitions between the high and low levels. In practice, this is never achieved because of physical limitations of the system that generates the waveform. The times taken for the signal to rise from the low level to the high level and back again are called the &quot;rise time&quot; and the &quot;fall time&quot; respectively.

If the system is overdamped, then the waveform may never actually reach the theoretical high and low levels, and if the system is underdamped, it will oscillate about the high and low levels before settling down. In these cases, the rise and fall times are measured between specified intermediate levels, such as 5% and 95%, or 10% and 90%. The bandwidth of a system is related to the transition times of the waveform; there are formulas allowing one to be determined approximately from the other.

<doc id="314653" wikidata="Q902642" url="?curid=314653" title="CHARMM">
<text>Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics (CHARMM) is the name of a widely used set of force fields for molecular dynamics, and the name for the molecular dynamics simulation and analysis computer software package associated with them. The CHARMM Development Project involves a worldwide network of developers working with Martin Karplus and his group at Harvard to develop and maintain the CHARMM program. Licenses for this software are available, for a fee, to people and groups working in academia.

== Force fields ==
The CHARMM force fields for proteins include: united-atom (sometimes termed &quot;extended atom&quot;) CHARMM19, all-atom CHARMM22 and its dihedral potential corrected variant CHARMM22/CMAP, as well as later versions CHARMM27 and CHARMM36 and various modifications such as CHARMM36m and CHARMM36IDPSFF. In the CHARMM22 protein force field, the atomic partial charges were derived from quantum chemical calculations of the interactions between model compounds and water. Furthermore, CHARMM22 is parametrized for the TIP3P explicit water model. Nevertheless, it is often used with implicit solvents. In 2006, a special version of CHARMM22/CMAP was reparametrized for consistent use with implicit solvent GBSW.

The CHARMM22 force field has the following potential energy function:

formula_1

The bond, angle, dihedral, and nonbonded terms are similar to those found in other force fields such as AMBER. The CHARMM force field also includes an improper term accounting for out-of-plane bending (which applies to any set of four atoms that are not successively bonded), where formula_2 is the force constant and formula_3 is the out-of-plane angle. The Urey-Bradley term is a cross-term that accounts for 1,3 nonbonded interactions not accounted for by the bond and angle terms; formula_4 is the force constant and formula_5 is the distance between the 1,3 atoms.

For DNA, RNA, and lipids, CHARMM27 is used. Some force fields may be combined, for example CHARMM22 and CHARMM27 for the simulation of protein-DNA binding. Also, parameters for NAD+, sugars, fluorinated compounds, etc., may be downloaded. These force field version numbers refer to the CHARMM version where they first appeared, but may of course be used with subsequent versions of the CHARMM executable program. Likewise, these force fields may be used within other molecular dynamics programs that support them.

In 2009, a general force field for drug-like molecules (CGenFF) was introduced. It &quot;covers a wide range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules, including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds&quot;. The general force field is designed to cover any combination of chemical groups. This inevitably comes with a decrease in accuracy for representing any particular subclass of molecules. Users are repeatedly warned in Mackerell&#x27;s website not to use the CGenFF parameters for molecules for which specialized force fields already exist (as mentioned above for proteins, nucleic acids, etc.).

CHARMM also includes polarizable force fields using two approaches. One is based on the fluctuating charge (FQ) model, also termed Charge Equilibration (CHEQ). The other is based on the Drude shell or dispersion oscillator model.

Parameters for all of these force fields may be downloaded from the Mackerell website for free.

== Molecular dynamics program ==
The CHARMM program allows for generating and analysing a wide range of molecular simulations. The most basic kinds of simulation are minimizing a given structure and production runs of a molecular dynamics trajectory. More advanced features include free energy perturbation (FEP), quasi-harmonic entropy estimation, correlation analysis and combined quantum, and quantum mechanics–molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods.

CHARMM is one of the oldest programs for molecular dynamics. It has accumulated many features, some of which are duplicated under several keywords with slight variants. This is an inevitable result of the many outlooks and groups working on CHARMM worldwide. The changelog file, and CHARMM&#x27;s source code, are good places to look for the names and affiliations of the main developers. The involvement and coordination by Charles L. Brooks III&#x27;s group at the University of Michigan is salient.

== Software history ==
Around 1969, there was considerable interest in developing potential energy functions for small molecules. CHARMM originated at Martin Karplus&#x27;s group at Harvard. Karplus and his then graduate student Bruce Gelin decided the time was ripe to develop a program that would make it possible to take a given amino acid sequence and a set of coordinates (e.g., from the X-ray structure) and to use this information to calculate the energy of the system as a function of the atomic positions. Karplus has acknowledged the importance of major inputs in the development of the (at the time nameless) program, including:

* Schneior Lifson&#x27;s group at the Weizmann Institute, especially from Arieh Warshel who went to Harvard and brought his consistent force field (CFF) program with him

In the 1980s, finally a paper appeared and CHARMM made its public début. Gelin&#x27;s program had by then been considerably restructured. For the publication, Bob Bruccoleri came up with the name HARMM (HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics), but it seemed inappropriate. So they added a C for Chemistry. Karplus said: &quot;I sometimes wonder if Bruccoleri&#x27;s original suggestion would have served as a useful warning to inexperienced scientists working with the program.&quot; CHARMM has continued to grow and the latest release of the executable program was made in 2015 as CHARMM40b2.

== Running CHARMM under Unix-Linux ==
The general syntax for using the program is:

codice_1

* codice_2 – The name of the program (or script which runs the program) on the computer system being used.
* codice_3 – A text file which contains the CHARMM commands. It starts by loading the molecular topologies (top) and force field (par). Then one loads the molecular structures&#x27; Cartesian coordinates (e.g. from PDB files). One can then modify the molecules (adding hydrogens, changing secondary structure). The calculation section can include energy minimization, dynamics production, and analysis tools such as motion and energy correlations.
* codice_4 – The log file for the CHARMM run, containing echoed commands, and various amounts of command output. The output print level may be increased or decreased in general, and procedures such as minimization and dynamics have printout frequency specifications. The values for temperature, energy pressure, etc. are output at that frequency.

== Volunteer computing ==
Docking@Home, hosted by University of Delaware, one of the projects which use an open-source platform for the distributed computing, BOINC, used CHARMM to analyze the atomic details of protein-ligand interactions in terms of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and minimizations.

World Community Grid, sponsored by IBM, ran a project named The Clean Energy Project which also used CHARMM in its first phase, which has been completed.

<text>Bernard Brendan &quot;Brian&quot; Farrell (9 January 1929 – 10 November 2014) was an Irish author, journalist, academic and broadcaster. He presented programmes such as &quot;Today Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Prime Time&quot; on RTÉ.

==Early life==
Born in Manchester, England to Irish parents, Farrell moved to Dublin, Ireland during the Second World War. He was educated at Coláiste Mhuire, Dublin; University College Dublin and Harvard University. He married Marie-Thérèse Dillon in April 1955 while attending Harvard.

==Family==
He is survived by his wife Marie-Therese and seven children, Naomi, Bernard, Miriam, David, Rachel, Theo and Brian.
Two of his sons followed him into academia: David Farrell is Head of the School of Politics and International Relations at University College Dublin, and Theo Farrell is the Deputy Vice-Chancellor(Education) at the University of Wollongong. Brian Farrell&#x27;s wife, Marie-Thérèse, is the daughter of Dr. Theo Dillon, one of the sons of John Dillon the Irish nationalist politician. Her uncle was James Dillon, the Leader of the Fine Gael party from 1959 to 1965.

==Academic career==
In 1955 he joined the administrative staff of University College Dublin became director of extramural studies and in 1957 assistant to the registrar. In 1966, he began lecturing in the Department of Ethics and Politics there and went on to become senior lecturer in politics. In the early 1980s, having run the Department of Ethics and Politics for a number of years since the death of the departmental head, Professor Rev Conor Martin, Farrell was controversially denied the post of department head and professor. The post instead was given to Professor John H. Whyte of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (QUB). In 1985 in compensation he was made Associate Professor of Politics, where he became the senior lecturer in Irish government. He retired from academia in the mid-1990s.

He wrote a number of books on Irish political history, including &quot;Chairman or Chief&quot; (regarding the office of the Taoiseach), &quot;The Founding of Dáil Éireann&quot; and a biography of Seán Lemass.

==Broadcasting career==
Farrell also had a successful career as a media commentator. He wrote articles for &quot;The Irish Press&quot; and the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. During the 1950s he worked with Radio Éireann and in 1962 he joined the newly established Irish television station, Telefís Éireann. He presented RTÉ&#x27;s main programmed of comment and analysis - &quot;Broadsheet&quot;, &quot;Newsbeat&quot;, &quot;7 Days&quot;, &quot;The Politics Programme&quot;, &quot;Frontline&quot;, &quot;Today Tonight&quot;, &quot;Farrell&quot; and &quot;Prime Time&quot; - into the new millennium. He also continued to work on radio from time to time until his retirement in 2004.

Farrell covered major events at home and abroad, starting with the visit of the American President John F. Kennedy to Ireland in 1963.

He presented the results programmed for ten Irish general elections. He interviewed several US Presidents, including this interview with Ronald Reagan in 1984.

Farrell was honored twice by the national press TV critics for his work in RTÉ current affairs programming. He received his first Jacob&#x27;s Award in 1968 for his presentation of &quot;7 Days&quot;. His second was awarded for his central role in RTÉ&#x27;s coverage of the 1977 general election results.

In December 2000, he presented an Irish historical program &quot;100 Years&quot;, a retrospective of events in Ireland over the 20th century.

In 2004 he presented a documentary &quot;Lights, Camera, Farrell!&quot;, that looks back at the election archives from television, highlighting some of the great moments from programmed and campaigns in Ireland.

==Death==
On 10 November 2014, Farrell died after a long battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease at the age of 85, he was surrounded by his family.

President Michael D Higgins described Farrell as &quot;an outstanding broadcaster and political commentator&quot; who &quot;set the standard for others to follow&quot;.

&quot;Prime Time&quot; presenter Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan said &quot;Brian had a vast knowledge of Irish politics and history. He could reference events that happened 100 years ago as clearly if they had happened last week. But he never showed it off or flaunted it.&quot; Ms O&#x27;Callaghan went on to say that Farrell had the ability to &quot;destroy and fillet politicians - but in the nicest possible way. There was no ego with Brian and that&#x27;s very unusual in our industry. He was a true gentleman and one of the good guys&quot;.

Tánaiste Joan Burton said he was &quot;a formidable interviewer for politicians to have to face&quot;.

RTÉ&#x27;s Director General Noel Curran described Farrell as &quot;a fantastic colleague. Wise, witty and supportive&quot;.

His Funeral Mass was held at 10.30am on Friday 14 November 2014 in the Church of the Holy Cross, Dundrum followed by cremation at Mt. Jerome, Harold&#x27;s Cross.

<text>Charles Gerald Anthony Mitchel (8 November 1920 – 18 August 1996) was an Irish actor and broadcaster, best known as an RTÉ television newscaster for almost 23 years.

==Early life==
Born in Dublin, Mitchel was educated at Clongowes Wood College boarding school in Clane, County Kildare. Mitchel subsequently attended Trinity College Dublin where he studied forestry. It was here that his interest in acting developed and he quickly became a leading member of the Trinity Players. Mitchel left Trinity in 1947 without taking a degree. He immediately joined the Gate Theatre where he played with the Longford company until 1958. He was one of the founders of Irish Actors Equity and served as president of the Catholic Stage Guild.

==Broadcasting career==
In 1961 Mitchel, joined the newly formed state television station, Telefís Éireann, as its first chief newsreader. His starting salary was £26 per week. Mitchel read the very first bulletin on the network at 9.15pm on Sunday 31 December 1961.

He received numerous honours, including being awarded television personality of the year in December 1962 - he also became the first RTÉ presenter to win a Jacobs&#x27; Award.

As chief newsreader, Mitchel led a team of readers for the main evening bulletins including Andy O&#x27;Mahony, Maurice O&#x27;Doherty, Don Cockburn and in later years, Derek Davis and Anne Doyle. Mitchel retired from RTE on Thursday 8 November 1984 after presenting his last TV bulletin, the flagship &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;.

In 1989 he joined LMFM, a local radio station in Drogheda, County Louth, where he read the news and answered listeners&#x27; queries.

==Personal life==
Mitchel was keenly interested in animal welfare and served as vice-president of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for several years in the 1980s. He bred basset hounds and adjudicated at dog shows.

Mitchel married Elizabeth (&#x27;Betty&#x27;) Stubbs on 9 May 1949 and they had two children, Nicholas and Susan. He died on 18 August 1996 at Bloomfield Nursing Home, Donnybrook and is buried at Glasnevin cemetery.

<doc id="314659" wikidata="Q1859538" url="?curid=314659" title="Manchester Oxford Road railway station">
<text>Manchester Oxford Road railway station is a railway station in Manchester, England, at the junction of Whitworth Street West and Oxford Street. It opened in 1849 and was rebuilt in 1960. It is the third busiest of the four stations in Manchester city centre.

The station serves the southern part of Manchester city centre, the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University, on the line from westwards towards Warrington, , Llandudno, Liverpool, and Blackpool. Eastbound trains go beyond Piccadilly to , , , , and . The station consists of four through platforms and one terminating bay platform.

The station sits on a Grade II listed viaduct, which was built in 1839 as part of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway. To reduce load on this viaduct, the station unusually utilises laminated wood structures as opposed to masonry, concrete, iron or steel. English Heritage describes it as a &quot;building of outstanding architectural quality and technological interest; one of the most dramatic stations in England&quot;. It was Grade II listed in 1995. Architectural critic Nikolaus Pevsner described the station as &quot;one of the most remarkable and unusual stations in the country&quot;.

It has long been envisaged, since the Manchester Hub plan in 2009, that the station will be upgraded and, in October 2016, a Transport and Works Act 1992 application was submitted to extend platforms at the station as part of the wider &quot;Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Oxford Road Capacity Scheme&quot;. , this application remains active but has not been approved by government. As a key transition node for both north–south and east–west transpennine routes, it is a recognised bottleneck and is the most delayed major station in the United Kingdom according to a &quot;Which?&quot; study in 2018 with over three quarters of services failing to depart on time during peak hours. In an attempt to obligate the DfT to provide funding for the Oxford Road upgrade to improve punctuality, Network Rail declared the Castlefield Corridor &#x27;congested&#x27; in September 2019.

==History==
The station opened as Oxford Road on 20 July 1849 and was the headquarters of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) until 1904. The station was built on the site of &#x27;Little Ireland&#x27;, a slum &quot;of a worse character than St Giles&quot;, in which about four thousand people had lived in &quot;measureless filth and stench&quot; (according to Friedrich Engels in &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England&quot;) and of a gasworks which was relocated to the west. The station buildings, which were temporary wooden structures, were accessed by an inclined esplanade winding to the right from Gloucester Street (now Whitworth Street West) to reach their north front.

There was a single platform on the north side of the line through to Manchester London Road (now Manchester Piccadilly) and a second platform on a west-facing siding. To allow for extra trains in connection with the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857, extra platforms and sidings were built, but removed afterwards. A meeting of MSJAR contract ticket holders in 1863 included in its list of complaints the want of punctuality &quot;especially as at Oxford Road station there is only one platform used for both passengers and milk&quot;.

From 1854 onwards, Oxford Road served as the terminus for a service to Liverpool, independent of the London and North Western Railway(LNWR) (one of the joint owners of MSJAR). The rail service went no further than Garston, with the final leg of the journey being made by steamer, but it alerted the LNWR to the possible use of the MSJAR by its co-owner, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) to reach areas west of Manchester. Consequently, in 1857, when the MSJAR began (the decision being taken on the casting vote of the board&#x27;s chairman, by rotation) running an Oxford Road – London Road service, the LNWR took strenuous measures to discourage it. Every train of the service was flagged down just short of the London Road platform and not allowed to proceed further, passengers being told they were liable to prosecution for trespass if they got out.

Goods going beyond the MSJAR were not handled at Oxford Road between March and July 1865 whilst some enlargement (and widening) work was carried out.

The MS&amp;LR pressed ahead with the joint lines to give it direct and independent rail access to Liverpool, but the LNWR blocked any matching improvement to the MSJAR and to Oxford Road, only offering to let these go ahead when the scheme for Manchester Central station was brought forward. To defeat the bill for the scheme, the LNWR then promised to cooperate with the MS&amp;LR in widening the MSJAR and enlarging Oxford Road.

However, Edward Watkin, chairman of the MS&amp;LR, later complained that the LNWR had ensured no improvement took place before the MS&amp;LR had its route to Liverpool. In October 1874, with Liverpool Central railway station now open, a letter to the press complained that with the additional services over the Cheshire Lines now using Oxford Road it was dangerously overcrowded. In the two and a half hours from 8 am, thirty-seven trains were booked to call at Oxford Road: this was far too many considering there was but one platform. Frequently, passengers were compelled to alight outside the station, sometimes on the siding rails, at risk of personal injury, because of &quot;the blocked-up state&quot; of the station. Furthermore, it was rumoured that the LNWR was planning to run a competing service (via Broadheath and Warrington) between Oxford Road and Liverpool Lime Street: if this were true, then it would further worsen the congestion, and the Board of Trade should forbid it.

In 1876, about £12,000 was spent on enlarging the station facilities, including the provision of a refreshment room; the station was then said to be handling about a hundred thousand passengers a week. Train-handling congestion was eased when Manchester Central railway station came into use, and in 1892 the MSJAR, under pressure to greatly improve Knott Mill, rejected the suggestion of Manchester Corporation that it could kill two birds with one stone by replacing its two existing unsatisfactory stations with a single new, thoroughly satisfactory, station somewhere between them. The MSJAR offered instead a limited reconstruction of the waiting rooms and booking hall; it also rejected the council&#x27;s offer of assistance with providing a more suitable approach to the station only to accept it two years later.

Press articles on the golden jubilee of the line in 1899 noted that the platform layout was still that of 1849 and somewhat of a museum piece: &quot;if the station were to be designed today... it would have a platform on each side of the main line, an advantage which its frequenters know it does not possess...&quot; and better use would be made of the space currently taken up by the terminal platform, used principally for special trains, mostly those serving Old Trafford during the cricket season.


Reconstruction took place during 1903–04. The approach was further improved, the ticket office and the refreshment room were expanded, and the MSJAR offices were removed. They were to have been moved to an adjacent building, but this proved unnecessary: the 78-year-old manager and secretary retired at the end of 1903, and administration of the line was taken over by an LNWR District Superintendent based at Manchester Exchange railway station: An island platform was added on the through lines, coming into use in November 1904.

From 1931, it was served by the MSJAR&#x27;s electric trains between Altrincham and Manchester Piccadilly. From July 1959, Altrincham electric trains were cut back from Piccadilly to terminate at Oxford Road in two new bay platforms. The station&#x27;s other lines were re-electrified at . The whole station was again rebuilt and reopened on 12 September 1960, to a design by W. R. Headley and Max Clendinning of British Rail&#x27;s London Midland region, encompassing three overlapping cones for the main structure. The station&#x27;s location on a viaduct running through the city centre required its load to be lightened, which the architects achieved by using wood for the station structure and platform canopies.

When Manchester Central railway station closed in 1969, further rebuilding took place: one of the bay platforms was taken out of use and a new through platform provided (platform 1), the others being renumbered accordingly. In 1971, the Altrincham line was re-electrified at and the 1930s DC trains withdrawn; from then on, local trains from Altrincham ran through to Piccadilly and on to . Oxford Road this, once again, became predominantly a through station.

Use of the station increased in 1988 when the Windsor Link between Deansgate and Salford Crescent opened, connecting lines to the north and south of Manchester. This led to further investment in the station, including the installation of computer screens.

In 1992, the Altrincham line stopping service was converted to light rail operation for the Manchester Metrolink. Oxford Road, once served almost entirely by suburban stopping trains, has now returned to having many more longer-distance services.

The station, a Grade II listed structure, requires frequent maintenance. In 2004, the station roof was partially refurbished to prevent leaking. In 2011, the platform shelters, seats and toilets were refurbished at a cost of £500,000. In 2013, the station received a £1.8million renovation to improve access, including lifts and an emergency exit.

On 10 December 2017, with the opening of the Ordsall Chord, it became possible for trains to run from to . Initially an hourly Northern service operated to the Calder Valley but, from May 2018, the TransPennine Express (TPE) to and services were rerouted through the station.

===Future===
In the Northern Hub plans, the platforms will be extended to allow use by longer trains. The bay platform will be removed to allow the other platforms to be extended. Under controversial plans much of the nearby area&#x27;s Victorian character will be razed, including the Salisbury pub, and the group of streets nearby known as &#x27;Little Ireland&#x27;.

In 2025, Network Rail began consulting on a proposed rationalisation to provide two through platforms accommodating 8-coach trains, with a central west-facing turnback platform replacing the current Platform 5.

==Architecture==
The station had become dilapidated by the 1950s and, in connection with the electrification and modernisation programme of the Manchester to London Euston line in 1960, the old buildings were replaced by the current structure by architects William Robert Headley and Max Clendinning and structural engineer Hugh Tottenham. It was designed in a distinctive style in concrete and wood with curves bringing to mind the Sydney Opera House.

The station is a grade II listed building. &#x27;Pevsner&#x27; calls it &quot;One of the most interesting and innovative buildings of the period ... the most ambitious example in this country of timber conoid shell roofing&quot; (p. 36) and &quot;One of the most remarkable and unusual stations in the country both for the architectural form and the technological interest...it is the most dramatic and it is an important example of the deployment of timber to achieve large roof spans incorporating clerestory lighting.&quot;(p. 178)

The choice of timber was forced by the weak viaduct on which the station is situated; anything heavier could have compromised its structural strength. The station has three overlapping conoid structures although they are only viewable from above. The light conoid roofs allow for a column-free interior space, maximising space and reducing load.

Despite its architectural acclaim, the structure began to deteriorate within ten years. The roof started to leak and for years the station&#x27;s platform buildings were encased in scaffolding and other metalwork, partly to support the structure and prevent material falling on the platforms and passengers. Partial remedial refurbishment was completed in 2004.

<doc id="314662" wikidata="Q5487069" url="?curid=314662" title="Frank Hall (broadcaster)">
<text>Frank Hall (24 February 1921 – 21 September 1995) was an Irish broadcaster, journalist, satirist and film censor. He is best remembered for his satirical revue programme &quot;Hall&#x27;s Pictorial Weekly&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Newry, County Down, Hall received little more than a primary education as he left school at the age of twelve to work in a local shop. He later worked as a waiter in London before moving to Dublin. On his return he joined the art department of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. Hall subsequently worked with the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; where he wrote a column on dance bands.

==Television==
After that, he moved to RTÉ where he worked in the newsroom. From 1964 to 1971 he presented &quot;Newsbeat&quot; , a regional news programme. He also presented &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; for the opening of the 1964 season, but his lack of success in that seat led to the return of the previous presenter, Gay Byrne. When &quot;Newsbeat&quot; ended, Hall started writing and presenting &quot;Hall&#x27;s Pictorial Weekly&quot;, a political satire show that ran for over 250 episodes until 1980. A successor show, &quot;Hall and Company&quot;, ran from 1980 until Hall&#x27;s retirement from television in 1986. He served as spokesperson for the Irish jury in the Eurovision Song Contest 1965 and 1966.

Hall won two Jacob&#x27;s Awards, in 1966 and 1975, for his work on &quot;Newsbeat&quot; and &quot;Hall&#x27;s Pictorial Weekly&quot; respectively.

==Film censor==
In 1978, Hall was appointed Ireland&#x27;s national film censor. During his period as censor he was known for his strict application of Irish censorship and his defence of family values. Among the films banned by him was &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, which he described as &quot;offensive to Christians and to Jews as well, because it made them appear a terrible load of gobshites&quot;.

==Family controversy==
Hall had a long running affair with the well known agony aunt, Frankie Byrne, with whom he had a daughter, who was given up for adoption shortly after her birth in 1956. In the 2006 RTE screening of Mint Production&#x27;s documentary &quot;Dear Frankie&quot;, Frank was named as the father of Frankie&#x27;s daughter though this was disputed at the time by Hall family members. In 2010, a play written by Niamh Gleeson, also entitled &quot;Dear Frankie,&quot; opened in the Liberty Hall theatre. Later in 2012, it opened again in the Gaiety Theatre, going on to play in theatres across the country.

==Death==
Hall died of a heart attack in Dublin in 1995. He is buried in Dardistown Cemetery in North Dublin.

<doc id="314665" wikidata="Q1461043" url="?curid=314665" title="Tom Gola">
<text>Thomas Joseph Gola (January 13, 1933 – January 26, 2014) was an American basketball player and politician. He is widely considered one of the greatest NCAA basketball players of all time. Gola was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1976. He led his high school team to the Philadelphia Catholic League championship, his college team to the National Invitation Tournament championship and the NCAA championship, and was on the Philadelphia Warriors 1956 championship team, all in the space of six years.

==Early life==
Thomas Joseph Gola was born on January 13, 1933, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the third of seven children born to Ike and Helen Gola. Gola&#x27;s father was a Philadelphia policeman of Polish descent who had changed the family&#x27;s surname from &quot;Galinsky&quot;. Gola was praised as a great all-around player as a high school student at La Salle College High School, part of the Philadelphia Catholic League, where he was second team All-Catholic League in 1949, and first team in 1950 and 1951. He led the Explorers to a Philadelphia Catholic League Championship in 1950. He also won the Markward Award as the Catholic League&#x27;s top player (future basketball hall of fame coach John Chaney won the Philadelphia Public League award the same year).

He entered La Salle University in 1951, a year after another Philadelphia basketball Hall-of-Famer, and future teammate on the Philadelphia Warriors from 1955 to 1962, Paul Arizin, graduated from Villanova. Arizin, ironically, had been cut from the La Salle high school team.

==College career==
Gola was one of the most talented collegiate athletes in Philadelphia sports history. He came to national attention while playing for his hometown La Salle University Explorers men&#x27;s basketball team.

Gola was recruited for college by the likes of Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp, North Carolina State coach Everett Case, and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, but he chose La Salle.

Gola starred as a college freshman and led La Salle to the 1952 NIT championship. He was the MVP of the NIT tournament. Gola paced the Explorers to the NCAA basketball championship in 1954 and was named tournament MVP. It was the first nationally televised NCAA championship game. That same season he was selected as National Player of the Year, was a consensus All-American, and was selected to the All-Tournament Team. In 1954, he also set a new collegiate records for rebounds (652), rebounds per game (23.0) and free throws in a season (202).

As a senior, Gola helped La Salle finish as the runner-up in the 1955 NCAA tournament to the University of San Francisco. It was the only one of his ten NCAA tournament games he would lose. He again made the All-Tournament Team, which also included future hall of fame legend Bill Russell (star of the championship Dons team). Gola was named the AP and UPI College Basketball Player of the Year, and was selected to the All-American team.

In his two years of NCAA tournament play, Gola scored 229 points. In his four years at La Salle, over 118 games, he averaged 20.9 points and 18.7 rebounds per game, with a .407 shooting percentage and .745 free throw percentage. As of 2024, he remains the NCAA all-time rebounding leader with 2,201 career rebounds. His was the first college player to score over 2,000 points and have over 2,000 rebounds. His La Salle teams were 102-19.

At , Gola was a forward who could shoot/score, rebound and defend, but he also had the ballhandling (dribbling, passing) skills of a guard, and with his shooting range and all-pro defensive skills, could play just as well in the backcourt. His nickname was &quot;Mr. All-Around&quot;.

He was inducted into the La Salle Hall of Athletes in 1961 and the Big 5 Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1977, Tom Gola was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame. He was in the inaugural class of Atlantic Ten Legends.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia / San Francisco Warriors (1955–1956, 1957–1962)===
After a phenomenal college career, Gola turned pro with the Philadelphia Warriors as a territorial draft pick. He teamed with All-Pros Paul Arizin and Neil Johnston to lead the Warriors to an NBA championship in 1956. He gained praise for concentrating on defense, passing and rebounding and allowing the other two to be the chief scorers during these years. It was his job to defend against the other team&#x27;s best guard, and to be a playmaker on offense for his teammates.

Gola served in the Army from 1956 to 1958, and he did not play in the 1956-1957 NBA season. He led the Warriors in assists in the 1957-1958 and 1958-1959 seasons, and was second team All-NBA in 1957-1958.

In 1959, Johnston temporarily retired due to a knee injury and the Warriors added seven-foot superstar Wilt Chamberlain. Again sacrificing himself for his team, Gola helped the Warriors consistently reach the NBA playoffs, but they could not beat the star-studded Boston Celtics in the NBA Eastern Division during his seasons in the early 1960s even with Chamberlain. During the 1959–60 season, Gola became the first Warrior to have three straight games with a triple-double (the only other being Draymond Green, 2016). On January 10, 1960, Gola recorded 18 points, 19 rebounds and 11 assists in a 116–103 win over the New York Knicks.

===New York Knicks (1962–1966)===
Gola played with the New York Knicks from 1962 to 1966. He led them in assists in 1963-1964.

Gola was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on April 26, 1976. He was a five-time NBA All-Star.

==Coaching career==
===La Salle (1968–1970)===
In 1968, Gola returned to his alma mater as head coach, leading the Explorers to a 37–13 record during his two-year stay. He was called in to pull the program out of trouble after a scandal under prior leadership. He was named Coach of the Year by Philadelphia and New York journalists. He led the Explorers to a 23–1 record during the 1968–69 season, but La Salle had been barred from the NCAA tournament before the season because an alumnus had offered some players &quot;no-show&quot; jobs. Many consider the 1968-1969 La Salle team, which was ranked second in the nation, the greatest team in Philadelphia city college basketball history, though barred from tournament play.

==Political career==
In 1968, Gola was elected to the Pennsylvania State House as a Republican, representing the Northeast Philadelphia-based 170th District. A change to the State Constitution made earlier that year had reorganized House seats into legislative districts, replacing the old system of allotting seats on an at-large, county-wide basis. This made Gola the first person to represent the newly created district. Ultimately, Gola would not finish-out his first term in the House, opting instead to seek the office of Philadelphia City Controller in 1969. He scored an 80,000-vote victory over Democrat Charles Peruto in the general election, and took office the following January.

Gola was defeated, however, in his bid for a second term in 1973 by Democrat William Klenk. His defeat was part of a broader setback for Republicans in the city that year, as Arlen Specter lost his bid for a third term as District Attorney of Philadelphia. Gola made his final attempt at elected office in 1983, when he sought the office of Mayor of Philadelphia. He came in last in the three-man Republican primary, behind Congressman Charlie Dougherty and the winner, John Egan, who went on to lose the fall general election to Wilson Goode.

==Personal life==
Gola was married to Caroline Norris in June 1955, and they had one son, Thomas Christopher.

At age 70, Gola fell into a coma after a serious fall, in 2003. Gola died on January 26, 2014, thirteen days after his 81st birthday, in Meadowbrook, Pennsylvania. A former U.S. Army specialist, he was buried at the Washington Crossing National Cemetery in Upper Makefield Township, Pennsylvania.

== Accolades ==
Wilt Chamberlain said, &quot;&#x27;When I was growing up [in Philadelphia], you whispered the name Tom Gola, because he was like a saint...&#x27;&quot; The legendary John Wooden said Gola was the &quot;&#x27;greatest all-round basketball player...&#x27;&quot; Notoriously difficult college coach Bob Knight once asked someone to introduce him to Gola, saying, &quot;&#x27;Can you do me a favor, can you introduce me to Tom Gola? He&#x27;s the only guy that played back then that could play for me now. He was my hero.&#x27;&quot; In 2002, he was honored in Madison Square Garden as one of the NCAA tournament’s five greatest players, along with Bill Bradley, Oscar Robertson, Chris Mullin, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame states of Gola that he is among a select few to have won NIT, NCAA, and NBA championships.

==Awards and honors==

=== Tom Gola Arena ===

Tom Gola Arena, home to the La Salle University Explorers men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, was named after him. The arena opened in 1998 and hosted its final game in 2024. Tom Gola Arena was reconstructed into the John Glaser Arena, the current home of the Explorers.

=== Tom Gola Plaza ===

Tom Gola Plaza, located outside of TruMark Financial Center, features a statue honoring Tom Gola surrounded by a brick walkway with names of doners to the men&#x27;s basketball team, lights, benches, a small garden, and a historical marker. The Plaza was opened on September 26, 2024, to continue the legacy of Gola after his name was no longer connected to the home of the Explorers.

=== Tom Gola Way ===
The driveway in front of TruMark Financial Center was renamed Tom Gola Way in 2024 to honor his legacy.

<text>Fire breathing is the act of making a plume or stream of fire by creating a precise mist of fuel from the mouth over an open flame. Regardless of the precautions taken, it is always a dangerous activity, but the proper technique and the correct fuel reduces the risk of injury or death.

==Performance==
Fire breathing is performed by both professionals and non-professionals. Professional fire breathers usually incorporate the fire performance skill within a show where other fire skills are performed. The element of danger in performing fire breathing and other fire skills enhances the entertainment spectacle for many audience members.

==Training==

The vast majority of professional fire-breathers are apprenticed by a seasoned professional and it is strongly recommended that teaching oneself be avoided due to the extreme risks. Most people who are taught fire breathing and eating skills are seasoned performers in their own right and are taught under the condition that the skills not be passed on until they become a recognised fire performer. Virtually all recorded incidents of serious injury by fire breathing involve untrained individuals, often while under the influence of alcohol. Using an incorrect fuel is usually a strong contributing factor.

== Health and safety ==
Performing with fire has many inherent risks to the health and safety of the practitioners. Fire breathing has a wider range of risks due to the required technique to create the effect. Having an actively spotting trained safety assistant with an appropriate fire blanket and fire extinguisher is an appropriate best practice when fire breathing and is a mandatory clause in most insurance policies for professional fire breathers.

===Fuels===
To increase safety, fire breathers must avoid highly combustible fuels such as alcohol, spirit-based fuels, and most petrochemicals, instead using safer combustibles with a higher flash point (&gt;50 °C). Due to its relatively safe (≈90 °C) flash point, paraffin, or highly purified lamp oil, is the preferred fuel for fire breathing. Although corn starch has been cited as a non-toxic fuel, the hazards of inhalation increase the potential risk of lung infections.

Fuels that are considered especially dangerous include:
* Ethanol can be absorbed into the blood stream without drinking. Thus attempting fire breathing with ethanol can cause intoxication.
* Methanol (used with many colored flame recipes) has a variety of entry vectors and can cause blindness or neurological disorders.
* Very low flash point fuels like naphtha, butane, and propane can create a condensed vapor build-up in the oral cavity leading to internal combustion, damaging the mouth or lungs. Naphtha is also quite carcinogenic, and performance careers built on using it entail a high risk of mouth cancer.
* Common fuels like gasoline and kerosene often contain carcinogenic components, such as sulfurated compounds or benzene. They also are far easier to ignite and even a seasoned fire breather would be at serious risk of injury using these fuels for breathing

===Self-ignition===
There is a risk of self ignition while performing fire breathing. Enhanced risk comes from the use of lower flash point fuels, inappropriate fabrics in clothing (such as polyester), wearing other flammable items or products (such as hairspray), poor technique and performance in unsuitable locations.

===Health===
When fire breathing with the wrong fuel, or when an improper technique is used, fire breathing can increase the risk of:
* Death
* Severe burns
* Fire breather&#x27;s pneumonia, a distinct type of lipid pneumonia
*Acute respiratory distress
* Oral and dental problems
* Fuel poisoning
* Dry cough
* Headache, dizziness, drunken ill feeling
* abdominal pains and diarrhea
* nausea and vomiting
* Dry tongue and cotton mouth
* Loss of taste
* Dry skin and topical heat burns
* Cancer of the mouth or throat from petrochemical exposure

==History==
A Roman slave named Eunus used fire breathing in an attempt to convince his fellow slaves that he had supernatural abilities in order for them to revolt against the Roman authorities. To do this, Eunus hid a nutshell containing burning material in his mouth.

==In modern culture==
Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss often includes fire-breathing in the band&#x27;s shows. &quot;It&#x27;s pretty dangerous,&quot; he observed. &quot;If you don&#x27;t blow it out and it doesn&#x27;t explode the right way, it comes back at you. The tip is &quot;[for someone who wanted to start breathing fire]&quot;… don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not worth it.&quot;

The MC Bat Commander, lead singer of the California comedy rock/New Wave/ska band The Aquabats, would regularly breathe fire to start off the band&#x27;s shows during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Mike Odd, the vocalist for the shock rock/horror metal band Rosemary&#x27;s Billygoat, included fire breathing in the band&#x27;s many outlandish stunts, alongside other forms of small-scale pyrotechnics. Zoran Žikić, bass guitarist for the Serbian and Yugoslav hard rock band Kerber, used to perform fire breathing on stage. In 1984, during an open-air concert, he got second degree burns while trying to perform fire breathing under windy conditions. After this incident he was forbidden by the rest of the band members to continue performing the stunt.

In Helluva Boss a character Asmodeus is loosely based on the fire breather.

==World records==

===Simultaneous fire breathing===
The world record for the number of people simultaneously fire breathing was set on 23 April 2009 by 293 students in the Dutch city of Maastricht as part of the Ragweek charity event.

===Fire breathing pass===
In August 2007 the record for the biggest fire breathing pass was set at the Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada; a single breath was passed to 21 people before the flame went out.

===Highest flame===
The world record for the highest flame is 8.05 m (26 ft 5 in), set by Antonio Restivo at a warehouse in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, on 11 January 2011.

===Most flames===

The most consecutive fire flames blown by one mouthful of fuel (without refuelling) is 387, achieved by Tobias Buschick (Germany) in Neuenbürg, Germany, on 1 August 2015.

The most flames blown in one minute is 189 (with refuelling) and was achieved by Zhu Jiangao (China) on the set of CCTV – Guinness World Records Special in Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China on 9 January 2015.

The most flames blown in 30 seconds is 55 (with refuelling) and is held by Christopher Campbell aka FenyxFyre (Canada) in London, Ontario, Canada, on 26 January 2021.

<text>Bnei Brak ( ) or Bene Beraq, is a city located on the central Mediterranean coastal plain in Israel, just east of Tel Aviv. A center of Haredi Judaism, Bnei Brak covers an area of 709 hectares (1,752 acres, or 2.74 square miles), and had a population of in . It is one of the poorest and most densely populated cities in Israel, and the fourth-most densely populated city in the world.

==History==
Bnei Brak takes its name from the ancient Biblical city of Beneberak, mentioned in the Tanakh (Joshua 19:45) in a long list of towns within the allotment of the tribe of Dan. Bnei Brak was founded as an agricultural village by eight Polish Hasidic families who had come to Palestine as part of the Fourth Aliyah. Yitzchok Gerstenkorn led them. It was founded about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the site of Biblical Beneberak. Bnei Brak was originally a moshava, and the primary economic activity was the cultivation of citrus fruits. Due to a lack of land, many of the founders turned to other occupations, and the village began to develop an urban character. Arye Mordechai Rabinowicz, formerly rabbi of Kurów in Poland, was the first rabbi. He was succeeded by Yosef Kalisz, a scion of the Vurker dynasty. The town was set up as a religious settlement from the outset, as is evident from this description of the pioneers: &quot;Their souls were revived by the fact that they merited what their predecessors had not. What particularly revived their weary souls in the mornings and toward evening, when they would gather in the beth midrash (Jewish study hall) situated in a special shack that was built immediately upon the arrival of the very first settlers, for &quot;tefilla betzibbur&quot; (communal prayer) three times a day, for the Daf Yomi &quot;shiur&quot; (Torah lesson) and a Gemara &quot;shiur&quot; and an additional one in Mishnayos and the Shulchan Aruch.&quot;

In 1928, the Great Synagogue was completed, and the village committee celebrated its inauguration by presenting statistics noting its development over the past four years. Bnei Brak, with a population of about 800 residents, covered about 2,000 dunams, including about 800 dunams which were citrus groves. It had 116 houses, 31 huts, six public buildings, and 48 cowsheds. In the summer of 1929, Bnei Brak was connected to the electricity grid. In the 1931 census of Palestine, the population of &quot;Benei Beraq&quot; was 956, all Jewish, in 255 houses. In 1940, it had 4,500 residents and 25 factories. In 1948, the population was 9,300. After 1948 new Bnei Brak neighborhoods including Neve Ahiezer were built on the Palestinian depopulated village of Al-Khayriyya. Bnei Brak achieved city status in 1950.

In April 2020, the entire city of Bnei Brak was placed under quarantine due to the coronavirus outbreak. On 29 March 2022, a Palestinian man killed five people in a mass shooting.

==Rabbinic presence==
Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (the &quot;Chazon Ish&quot;) emigrated from Belarus to Bnei Brak in its early days, and attracted a large following there. Leading rabbis who have lived in Bnei Brak include Yaakov Landau, Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler, Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky (&quot;the Steipler&quot;), Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman (Ponevezher Rov), Elazar Menachem Mann Shach, Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz, Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman, Nissim Karelitz, Shmuel Wosner and Chaim Kanievsky. In the early 1950s, the Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Chaim Meir Hager, founded a large neighborhood in Bnei Brak which continued to serve as a dynastic center under his son, Moshe Yehoshua Hager, and under his grandsons, Yisrael Hager and Menachem Mendel Hager.

Beginning in the 1960s, the rebbes of the Ukrainian Ruzhin dynasty (Sadigura, Husiatyn and Bohush) who had formerly lived in Tel Aviv, moved to Bnei Brak. In the 1990s, they were followed by the rebbe of Modzhitz. Unlike the former four Gerrer rebbes, who lived in Jerusalem, the current rebbe was a Bnei Brak resident until 2012. The rebbes of Alexander, Biala-Bnei-Brak, Koidenov, Machnovke, Nadvorne, Premishlan, Radzin, Shomer Emunim, Slonim-Schwarze, Strykov, Tchernobil, Trisk-Bnei-Brak and Zutshke also reside in Bnei Brak. Moshe Yehuda Leib Landau was the Rabbi of Bnei Brak until his death on March 30, 2019. He was a respected authority on &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) and &quot;kashrut&quot; (kosher supervision). The &quot;Rav Landau&quot; &quot;hechsher&quot; (kosher certification) is widely accepted. Nissim Karelitz, chief rabbi (&quot;av beis din&quot;) of the Lithuanian Haredi community, heads a beth din (rabbinical court) of Lithuanian and Hasidic dayanim, called &quot;She&#x27;eris Yisroel&quot;.

==Demographics==
According to figures by the municipality of Bnei Brak, the city has a population of over 181,000 residents, the majority of whom are Haredi Jews. In the 2021 Israeli legislative election, 89% of the voters chose Haredi parties. Pardes Katz, a neighborhood of about 30,000 inhabitants in northern Bnei Brak, is the sole neighborhood of the city where the majority of residents are not Haredi. In 2022, Bnei Brak was ranked Israel&#x27;s most densely-populated city, with 28,000 people per square kilometer.

==Economy==
One of the landmarks of Bnei Brak is the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Kahaneman St. It is owned by the Central Bottling Company (CBC), which has held the Israeli franchise for Coca-Cola products since 1968. It is among Coca-Cola&#x27;s ten largest single-plant bottling facilities worldwide.

Two major factories which dominated the centre of Bnei Brak for many years were the Dubek cigarette factory and the Osem food factory. As the town grew they found themselves in the middle of a residential area, and both companies subsequently left the area. Osem&#x27;s main factory is now located on Jabotinsky Road in Petah Tikva, just next to Bnei Brak.

In 2011 construction started on a business district, which will include 15 office towers. Several of the towers of the Bnei Brak Business Center are already built , and other buildings won&#x27;t be completed until after 2021.
== Transportation ==
===Railways===
Bnei Brak–Ramat HaHayal railway station opened in 1949 as &quot;Tel Aviv North station&quot;. It was renamed to Bnei Braq station in 1954. After a decline in importance of rail transport culminating in the closure of the station in the 1990s, the station was refurbished and reopened in 2000. The tracks through the station were electrified with the Israeli standard 25 kV 50 Hz AC in late 2021. In 2019 over a million passengers used the station.

==Healthcare==
Bnei Brak is home to Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center (MHMC), a Haredi hospital. It is located on the east side of the city, on the outskirts of the Ramat Aharon and Or Haim neighborhoods. It serves the residents of Bnei Brak, along with nearby Giv&#x27;at Shmuel, Petah Tikva and Ramat Gan. Founded in 1990, MHMC&#x27;s initially focus was maternity, and now it is a general care facility. It consists of 18 medical departments and 32 outpatient clinics, including 12 dialysis units, a high-risk pregnancy ward and a neonatal intensive care unit. With a 320-bed capacity, MHMC handles 13,000 births, and carries out more than 6,000 surgical procedures per annum. It features a six-story Mental Health Center, which sponsors an eating disorder clinic.

MHMC&#x27;s affairs are managed in strict accordance with &quot;halakha&quot;. It has been managed by three distinct groups: A board of directors, an association of rabbis and public servants, and most influential of all, the &quot;Halakhic Supervision Committee&quot;, a rabbinical committee consisting of Shmuel Wosner, Nissim Karelitz and Yitzchok Zilberstein, with Yisrael Rand, a confidant of Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman, serving as its secretary. Chaim Kanievsky was on its board of directors, as was Moshe Lion. If during any medical procedure there might arise some &quot;halakhic&quot; doubt, the medical staff will activate the &quot;halakhic&quot; team, which is headed by the hospital&#x27;s rabbi. Only after the &quot;halakhic&quot; ruling is issued can the medical activity be carried out. MHMC has its own beth midrash on the premises.

==Culture and lifestyle==

After Mayor Gottlieb of the National Religious Party was defeated, Haredi parties grew in status and influence; since then they have governed the city. As the Haredi population grew, the demand for public religious observance increased and more residents requested the closure of their neighbourhoods to vehicular traffic on Shabbat. In a short period, most of Bnei Brak&#x27;s secular and Religious Zionist residents migrated elsewhere, and the city has become almost homogeneously Haredi. The city had one non-Haredi neighborhood, Pardes Katz, but it too has had an influx of Haredim and is today predominantly Haredi. Some names of streets with a Zionist connotation were renamed for prominent Haredi figures, such as Herzl Street south of Jabotinsky Street, which was changed to HaRav Shach Street. Bnei Brak is one of the two poorest cities in Israel. A street in Bnei Brak was named after one of the town&#x27;s founders who was a great-grandfather of murdered journalist Daniel Pearl.

Bnei Brak is home to Israel&#x27;s first women-only department store, only one example of gender segregation in what is viewed as an ultra-orthodox city. Bnei Brak was home to one of the original gender-segregated bus lines that Israel&#x27;s courts ruled were illegal. Mehadrin bus lines are a type of bus line in Israel that mostly ran in and/or between major Haredi population centers and in which gender segregation and other rigid religious rules observed by some ultra-Orthodox Jews were applied until 2011. In these sex-segregated buses, female passengers sat in the back of the bus and entered and exited the bus through the back door if possible, while the male passengers sat in the front part of the bus and entered and exited through the front door. Additionally, &quot;tzniut&quot; (modest dress) was often required for women, playing a radio or secular music on the bus was avoided, and advertisements were censored.

The Bnei Brak municipality set up an alternative water supply, for use on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. This supply, which does not require intervention by Jews on days of rest, avoids the problems associated with Jews working on the day of rest at Mekorot, the national water company. Most of the streets are closed on Shabbat and Jewish holidays.

Bnei Brak won national attention when it lost a battle to remove the photos of women candidates from Likud election ads. Orly Erez-Likhovski, legal advisor of the Israel Religious Action Center declared it a victory for gender equality: 

In 2023, the Bnei Brak municipality made a loan of 20 million shekels to deal with the city&#x27;s rat issue. Earlier that year in June, a toddler was bitten throughout by rats in bed and found covered by blood. She was then rushed to the hospital Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center
(MHMC).
According to a city councilor, Yaakov Vidar of Likud, who ranked the city as one of the dirtiest in Israel, the mayor first denied there was a rat issue then had to admit the problem after the pressure from him and Idit Silman, the Minister of Environmental Protection, but the mayor claimed his words were merely a sarcastic joke.
The causes of the rodents were attributed to mishandling of garbage and sewage, and the creepy feature of limestone and brittle concrete that were used to build the city. The municipality also blamed the construction of Tel Aviv Light Rail disturbed the underground rats and forced them to move to the city.

<text>Lillooet () is a district municipality in the Squamish-Lillooet region of southwestern British Columbia. The town is on the west shore of the Fraser River immediately north of the Seton River mouth. On BC Highway 99, the locality is by road about northeast of Pemberton, northwest of Lytton, and west of Kamloops.

==First Nations==
A main population centre of the Stʼatʼimc (Lillooet Nation), who comprise just over 50 per cent of the Lillooet area residents, it is one of the southernmost communities in North America where indigenous people form the majority. First Nations communities assert the land is traditional territory, having been continuously inhabited for thousands of years. The confluence of several main streams with the Fraser attracted large seasonal and permanent indigenous populations. Situated in the Lower Fountain, the Bridge River Rapids (Sat&#x27; or Setl), which blocked migrating salmon, has remained a popular fishing and fish drying site for centuries. Keatley Creek Archaeological Site, one of the largest ancient pit-house communities in the Pacific Northwest, is one of the many archaeological and heritage sites in the vicinity. Several petroglyph sites have been documented along the Fraser in the vicinity of Lillooet.

==Name origin==
The First Nations name of Pap-shil-KWA-KA-meen translates as the &quot;place where the three rivers meet&quot;. The former European name of Cayoosh Flat inferred a dead or dying Cayuse horse (namely a decrepit specimen) at the river. In 1859, Governor Douglas granted a petition to change the name to Lillooet. The Lil&#x27;wat people lived on the Douglas Road, a.k.a. the Lakes Route, which was the main trail from the south. This name, which means &quot;wild onion&quot;, appears on Anderson&#x27;s 1849 map.

==Roads, ferries and bridges==
For the fortune seekers of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush (upper canyon) and the Cariboo Gold Rush, the portage-intensive Douglas Road from the south terminated at Lillooet. 
Across the Fraser, Parsonville was &quot;Mile 0&quot; of the Old Cariboo Road, which stretched about northward to Alexandria. Built as a toll road by Gustavus Blin Wright, the first 20 to 30 kilometres of tortuous canyon-brink grade remained little changed until the 1970s. In 1864, the shorter Cariboo Road, which connected Yale to Barkerville via Ashcroft, bypassed Lillooet.

The Fraser was crossed by ferry at Lillooet. Parsonville had faded into obscurity by 1889, when the first bridge at Lillooet opened. Consequently, Lillooet became &quot;Mile 0&quot;. The numbered roadhouse names of the Cariboo district became measured from the bend in Main Street commemorated by a cairn erected in 1939. However, when the present bridge was constructed south of the town, these old travel measurements became understated by about two miles.

In 1994, fire destroyed the station bridge over the Seton River. In 2020, a two-lane structure replaced the temporary single lane bridge installed in 1994.

==Mining== 
The section of Main Street north from the cairn was called &quot;the Golden Mile&quot; allegedly to reflect gold dust scattered on the ground but indisputably as a supply hub fueled by the goldrush traffic.

West of Lillooet, the Golden Cache Mine on Cayoosh Creek, was staked in 1895. However, promising expectations proved illusive, which ended further investment. The associated prospecting boom ceased by 1900, when mining activity relocated to the Klondike.

Other gold prospecting in the area included underground hard-rock mining in the Bridge River Country, which began in the 1880s and 1890s, but peaked from the 1930s to the 1950s. Gold Bridge and Bralorne were mining centres. Prospecting for gold continues and to a lesser extent for copper, silver and nephrite jade. Until the discovery of larger jade deposits near Cassiar, the Lillooet area was the world&#x27;s largest source of the nephrite form. Unknown tonnes were exported to China before government assayers discovered the nature of the &quot;black rocks&quot; that the Chinese miners found so interesting.

In the 1950s, local farmer and teacher Ron Purvis adapted the skil-saw concept to create a diamond rotary blade. The blade could safely cut the immovable jade boulders which line the banks and beds of the Fraser and Bridge rivers, whereas blasting would have shattered the rock. Although local stores sell polished jade souvenirs, major commercial jade operations no longer exist in the Lillooet area.

==Railway==
The northward advance of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE) rail head reached the head of
Seton Lake in January 1915 and the Lillooet locality the following month. PGE built a depot between the Seton River and Cayoosh Creek. That month, the first passenger train arrived, triggering a revival for the isolated town, since a railway could ship agricultural produce. By year end, the track reached Clinton, an additional .

To benefit the railway rather than land speculators, PGE had bypassed the downtown by crossing the Fraser south of the Seton River on the Lillooet railway bridge. PGE erected a station and four-stall roundhouse at East Lillooet, which was a divisional point. The initial depot, called Lillooet station, was westward across the Fraser.

In 1930, PGE built the Lillooet Diversion from the head of Seton Lake, through the downtown, and north to the Polley bridge. In 1931, PGE completed the bridge, built a new two-storey station downtown, and dismantled and reassembled the roundhouse nearby. The latter was demolished during the early 1970s. The Lillooet station building, which was replaced in 1986, was east of Craig ( east of Retakit after Craig closed) and south of Polley ( south of Fountain after Polley closed).

The withdrawal of the Cariboo Prospector passenger train in October 2002 ended through service. Canadian National Railway freight trains on break and the Kaoham Shuttle still use the station.

==Early community==
The town began as a goldrush centre in the late 1850s, booming during the progression of discoveries on the Fraser and in the Cariboo in the early 1860s. The title of &quot;the largest town west of Chicago and north of San Francisco&quot; moved in rapid succession from Yale to Lillooet, and then to Barkerville. Just after this gold rush, the town&#x27;s layout was surveyed by the Royal Engineers.

In 1860, the population was 4,000–5,000. About that time, Richard Hoey was granted on the Texas Creek Road. St. Mary the Virgin Anglican church was built in 1861 and a school established in 1863. That year, the hotels and shops served a population of about 1,600. The Stage Hotel (1860) was considered first class. The Pioneer Hotel (1862) became the Excelsior in the early 1900s. Further lodgings were the International Hotel (1866) and Victoria Hotel (1892).

In 1864, Joseph Watkinson, Thomas Harris, F.W. Foster, and Richard Hoey built the first flour mill. In 1896, St. Andrews Presbyterian church was erected. In 1904, the town was surveyed.

The 1930 fire destroyed the Excelsior, Hurley&#x27;s Grocery, a movie theatre and the government liquor store. In 1946, the settlement incorporated as a village municipality. In 1948, fire destroyed the Log Cabin Theatre, an 1860s livery barn that had been remodelled into theatre in 1934.

Booms occurred during local gold mining activity, and in the 1940s and 50s during the construction of the Bridge River Power Project. In 1996, the town re-incorporated as a district municipality.

==Forestry and agriculture==

The economy was historically based upon logging, the railway, ranching, farming, and government services. The long growing season has favoured orchards, and in recent times, ginseng. Once, hop and tobacco crops supported the former local beer, cigar and chewing tobacco industries. The town has relied upon forestry since the mid-1970s.

In the 1940s, an Italian named Savona planted vines in the Fountain area. Established in 2009, the Fort Berens Winery in East Lillooet was the first attempt at commercial viticulture. Visitors can taste the award-winning wines. The Cliff &amp; George Vineyards, about south on the west side of the Fraser, offers a similar opportunity as well as picnic areas on the historic Texas Creek Ranch near Texas Creek.

==Japanese internment camps==
Four internment camps existed in the Lillooet area during World War II, following the removal of Japanese Canadians from the British Columbia Coast in 1942. Each were &quot;self-support&quot; sites, where family groups who had the financial means could remain together, but the locations were more isolated than the camps in the Kootenays. Since internees were not permitted to return to the coast until 1949, many families permanently settled in Lillooet. The largest camp was East Lillooet, housing 309 people. The other nearby camps were at Shalalth, Minto Mine, and McGillvray Falls.

==Later community==
The town includes infrastructure typical for its size.

In 2009, the district developed a community plan. In 2013, the water treatment plant received a $5.6 million upgrade. In 2019, Tourism Lillooet released a strategic plan. In 2022, an electric vehicle fast charging station opened.

Police, fire, and ambulance, respectively operate emergency service bases. The Lillooet Hospital &amp; Health Centre is a Level 1 Community Hospital which includes 24-hour emergency services. The district owns and operates the Lillooet Airport.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lillooet had a population of 2,302 living in 1,111 of its 1,214 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 2,275. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Lillooet&#x27;s larger regional population includes that of the three large bands of the St&#x27;at&#x27;imc or Lillooet Nation whose reserves abut the town on all sides, and another three large reserves within ; 430 of the District of Lillooet&#x27;s population are aboriginal. Historical populations have included large numbers of Americans and Chinese, although there are few of either today (although many longtime local families, First Nations and non-First Nations, have some bloodlines from both). The town&#x27;s non-native population has been historically multi-ethnic in extraction, with a relatively high-rate of intermarriage between all groups.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Lillooet included:
*Irreligion (1,490 persons or 65.5%)
*Christianity (735 persons or 32.3%)
*Other (25 persons or 1.1%)
==Education==
Lillooet has one high school, Lillooet Secondary, which also serves students from neighbouring rural localities such as Shalalth, Seton Portage, Gold Bridge and Bralorne, although those communities do offer students a secondary school program. Cayoosh Elementary School is in the Cayoosh Heights subdivision and George M. Murray Elementary serves North Lillooet. The Upper St&#x27;at&#x27;imc Culture, Language and Education Society (USCLES) operates education programs, but most St&#x27;at&#x27;imc children attend the public school system. Post-secondary programs are offered at a Thompson Rivers University campus. The Fountainview Academy, about south, is an international private school, which offers work-study experience that includes organic farming.

==Climate==
Lillooet experiences a humid continental/oceanic climate, but it borders on a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb/Dfb/BSk).&quot;

Situated at an intersection of deep gorges in the lee of the Coast Mountains, it has a dry climate with an average of of precipitation being recorded annually. The locality often vies with Lytton and Osoyoos for the title of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Hot Spot&quot; on a daily basis in summer.

Lillooet holds the record for the fourth-hottest temperature recorded in British Columbia and Canada (behind Lytton, Ashcroft and Kamloops). On 29 June 2021, during the 2021 Western North America heat wave which brought unprecedented heat to the Pacific Northwest, the temperature reached . Lillooet also holds the record for the hottest temperature recorded in the province during the months of April (), May (), and December (). The coldest temperature recorded was measured at the airport during a November cold snap in 1985.

With an average annual snowfall of , Lillooet is the least snowy place in the BC Interior.

<doc id="314675" wikidata="Q6570217" url="?curid=314675" title="List of English words with disputed usage">
<text>Some English words are often used in ways that are contentious among writers on usage and prescriptive commentators. The contentious usages are especially common in spoken English, and academic linguists point out that they are accepted by many listeners. While in some circles the usages below may make the speaker sound uneducated or illiterate, in other circles the more standard or more traditional usage may make the speaker sound stilted or pretentious.

For a list of disputes more complicated than the usage of a single word or phrase, see English usage controversies.

== A ==

* – Some have argued that this word should not be used in the sense of &quot;to annoy&quot; or &quot;to oppress&quot;, but only to mean &quot;to make worse&quot;. According to AHDI, the use of &quot;aggravate&quot; as &quot;annoy&quot; occurs in English as far back as the 17th century. In Latin, from which the word was borrowed, both meanings were used. Sixty-eight percent of AHD4&#x27;s usage panel approves of its use in &quot;It&#x27;s the endless wait for luggage that aggravates me the most about air travel.&quot; M-W mentions that while &quot;aggravate&quot; in the sense of &quot;to rouse to displeasure or anger by usually persistent and often petty goading&quot; has been around since the 17th century, disapproval of that usage only appeared around 1870. RH states in its usage note under &quot;aggravate&quot; that &quot;The two most common senses of &quot;aggravate&quot; are &#x27;to make worse&#x27; and &#x27;to annoy or exasperate.&#x27; Both senses first appeared in the early 17th century at almost the same time; the corresponding two senses of the noun &quot;aggravation&quot; also appeared then. Both senses of &quot;aggravate&quot; and &quot;aggravation&quot; have been standard since then.&quot; Chambers cites this usage as &quot;colloquial&quot; and that it &quot;is well established, especially in spoken English, although it is sometimes regarded as incorrect.&quot;
* – originally a contraction of &quot;am not&quot;, this word is widely used as a replacement for &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;hasn&#x27;t&quot; as well. While &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; has existed in the English language for a very long time and is a common word in many dialects in both North America and the British Isles, it is not a part of standard English, and its use in formal writing is not recommended by most usage commentators. The above notwithstanding, &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; is used by educated speakers and writers for deliberate effect, what &quot;Oxford American Dictionary&quot; describes as &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; or &quot;reverse snobbery&quot;, and what &quot;Merriam-Webster Collegiate&quot; calls &quot;emphatic effect&quot; or &quot;a consistently informal style&quot;.
* – Some argue this cannot be used in the non-legal sense of &quot;an explanation or excuse to avoid blame or justify action.&quot; AHD4 notes that this usage was acceptable to &quot;almost half&quot; of the usage panel, while most opposed the word&#x27;s use as a verb. M-W mentions no usage problems, listing the disputed meaning second to its legal sense without comment. OED cites the non-legal noun and verb usages as colloquial and &quot;orig[inally] U.S.&quot;. Chambers deems this use &quot;colloquial&quot;.
* – An alternative to &quot;all right&quot; that some consider illiterate but others allow. RH says that it probably arose in analogy with other similar words, such as &quot;altogether&quot; and &quot;already&quot;; it does concede the use in writing as &quot;informal&quot;, and that &quot;all right&quot; &quot;is used in more formal, edited writing&quot;. AHD4 flags &quot;alright&quot; as &quot;nonstandard&quot;, and comments that this unacceptance (compared to &quot;altogether&quot; etc.) is &quot;peculiar&quot;, and may be due to its relative recentness (&quot;altogether&quot; and &quot;already&quot; date back to the Middle Ages, &quot;alright&quot; only a little over a century). Chambers refers to varying levels of formality of &quot;all right&quot;, deeming &quot;alright&quot; to be more casual; it recommends the use of &quot;all right&quot; &quot;in writing for readers who are precise about the use of language&quot;.
* – Some contend this word should not be used to begin a sentence. AHD4 says &quot;63 percent of the Usage Panel found acceptable the example &#x27;The warranty covers all power-train components. Also, participating dealers back their work with a free lifetime service guarantee. See also &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot; (below).
* – Some argue that &quot;alternative&quot; should be used only when the number of choices involved is exactly two. While AHD4 allows &quot;the word&#x27;s longstanding use to mean &#x27;one of a number of things from which only one can be chosen&#x27; and the acceptance of this usage by many language critics&quot;, it goes on to state that only 49% of its usage panel approves of its use as in &quot;Of the three alternatives, the first is the least distasteful.&quot; Neither M-W nor RH mentions any such restriction to a choice of two. Chambers qualifies its definition as referring to &quot;strictly speaking, two, but often used of more than two, possibilities&quot;.
* a.m./p.m. – These are abbreviations for the Latin adverbial phrases &quot;ante meridiem&quot; (&quot;before noon&quot;) and &quot;post meridiem&quot; (&quot;after noon&quot;). Some argue that they therefore should not be used in English as nouns meaning &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;afternoon&quot;; however, such use is consistent with ordinary nominalization features of English. AHD4 lists adjectival usage with &quot;an A.M. appointment&quot; and &quot;a P.M. appointment&quot;. RH gives &quot;Shall we meet Saturday a.m.?&quot; without comment. Also, the National Institute of Standards and Technology contends it is incorrect to use 12 a.m. or 12 p.m. to mean either noon or midnight.
* – Some speakers feel it is an obsolete form of . &quot;Amidst&quot; is more common in British English than American English, though it is used to some degree in both.
* – Some speakers feel it is an obsolete form of . &quot;Amongst&quot; is more common in British English than American English, though it is used to some degree in both.
* / and – The traditionalist view is that &quot;between&quot; should only be used when there are only two objects (or people) for comparison; and &quot;among&quot; or &quot;amongst&quot; should be used for more than two objects (or people). Most style guides and dictionaries do not support this advice, saying that &quot;between&quot; can be used to refer to something that is in the time, space or interval that separates more than two items. M-W says that the idea that &quot;between&quot; can be used only of two items is &quot;persistent but unfounded&quot; and AHD4 calls it a &quot;widely repeated but unjustified tradition&quot;. The OED says &quot;In all senses, &quot;between&quot; has been, from its earliest appearance, extended to more than two&quot;. Chambers says &quot;It is acceptable to use &quot;between&quot; with reference to more than two people or things&quot;, although does state that &quot;among&quot; may be more appropriate in some circumstances.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: I parked my car between the two telegraph poles.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: You&#x27;ll find my brain between my ears.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The duck swam between the reeds. (Undisputed if there are exactly two reeds)
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: They searched the area between the river, the farmhouse, and the woods.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: We shared the money evenly amongst the three of us.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: We shared the money between Tom, Dick, and me.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: My house was built among the gum trees.
* – Some argue &quot;amount&quot; should not be substituted for &quot;number&quot;. They recommend the use of &quot;number&quot; if the noun is countable and &quot;amount&quot; only if it is uncountable. While RH acknowledges the &quot;traditional distinction between &quot;amount&quot; and &quot;number&quot;, it mentions that &quot;[a]lthough objected to, the use of &quot;amount&quot; instead of &quot;number&quot; with countable nouns occurs in both speech and writing, especially when the noun can be considered as a unit or group &quot;(the amount of people present; the amount of weapons)&quot; or when it refers to money &quot;(the amount of dollars paid; the amount of pennies in the till)&quot;. (see also &quot;less&quot;)
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: I was amazed by the amount of people who visited my website.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: The number of people in the lift must not exceed 10.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: I was unimpressed by the amount of water consumed by the elephant.
* – Some argue that sentences should not begin with the word &quot;and&quot; on the argument that as a conjunction it should only join clauses within a sentence. AHD4 states that this stricture &quot;has been ridiculed by grammarians for decades, and ... ignored by writers from Shakespeare to Joyce Carol Oates.&quot; RH states &quot;Both &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot;, and to a lesser extent &quot;or&quot; and &quot;so&quot;, are common as transitional words at the beginnings of sentences in all types of speech and writing&quot;; it goes on to suggest that opposition to this usage &quot;... probably stems from the overuse of such sentences by inexperienced writers.&quot; ENCARTA opines that said opposition comes from &quot;too literal an understanding of the &#x27;joining&#x27; function of conjunctions&quot;, and states that any overuse is a matter of poor style, not grammatical correctness. COED calls the usage &quot;quite acceptable&quot;. Many verses of the King James Bible begin with &quot;and&quot; (though this could be regarded as a Hebraism), as does William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Jerusalem&quot;). Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage defends this use of &quot;and&quot;. Chambers states that &quot;Although it is sometimes regarded as poor style, it is not ungrammatical to begin a sentence with &quot;and&quot;.&quot; See also also (above) and but (below).
* – Although the &quot;expect&quot; sense is accepted by 87% of the Usage Panel, some prescriptivists insist that &quot;deal with in advance&quot; is the only correct use. Acceptance of the &quot;forestall&quot; sense has dropped to 57%.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: We anticipated the coming winter by stocking up on firewood.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: We anticipated a pleasant sabbatical year.
* – Some argue that this word should only be used in the sense of &quot;worried&quot; or &quot;worrisome&quot; (compare &quot;&quot;), but it has been used in the sense of &quot;eager&quot; for &quot;over 250 years&quot;; 52% of AHD4&#x27;s Usage Panel accepts its use in the sentence &quot;We are anxious to see the new show of contemporary sculpture at the museum.&quot; Also, it suggests that the use of &quot;anxious&quot; to mean &quot;eager&quot; may be mild hyperbole, as the use of &quot;dying&quot; in the sentence &quot;I&#x27;m dying to see your new baby.&quot; RH states bluntly that &quot;its use in the sense of &#x27;eager&#x27; ... is fully standard.&quot; M-W defines &quot;anxious&quot; as &quot;3 : ardently or earnestly wishing &lt;anxious to learn more&gt; / synonym see EAGER&quot; Chambers gives &quot;3 very eager • &quot;anxious to do well.&quot;&quot;

== B ==

* and – &quot;Barbaric&quot; applies to the culture of barbarians and may be positive (&quot;barbaric splendor&quot;); &quot;barbarous&quot; applies to the stereotypical behavior of barbarians and is negative (&quot;barbarous cruelty&quot;). This is standard English usage. However, M-W equates the third meaning of &quot;barbaric&quot; with the third of &quot;barbarous&quot;, that is, &quot;mercilessly harsh or cruel&quot;; COD11 and Chambers list &quot;savagely cruel&quot; and &quot;cruel and brutal; excessively harsh or vicious&quot;, respectively, as the &quot;first&quot; meanings for &quot;barbaric&quot;. Only AHD4 disallows this usage, and without comment.
** &quot;Undisputed&quot;. The environment of the venue was barbaric.
** &quot;Undisputed&quot;. Terrorism is barbarous.
** &quot;Disputed&quot;. Capital punishment is a disgusting, barbaric measure.
* begging the question – In logic, &quot;begging the question&quot; is another term for &quot;petitio principii&quot; or arguing in a circle, in other words making assumptions in advance about the very issue in dispute. It could also be understood as &quot;beggaring the question&quot;, i.e. making a beggar of the question.
:It is now often used to mean simply &quot;raising the question&quot; or &quot;leading to the question&quot;. The latter usage does not match the usual pattern (e.g. &quot;begging &quot;for&quot; money&quot;, &quot;begging &quot;for&quot; mercy&quot;), which would suggest &quot;begging for the question&quot;.
:* &quot;Undisputed&quot;. You argue that Christianity must be true because the Bible says so. Isn&#x27;t that begging the question?
:* &quot;Disputed&quot;. You want to go to the theatre. That begs the question which day we should go.
* – Some argue that if &quot;and&quot; should not be used to begin sentences, then neither should &quot;but&quot;. These words are both conjunctions; thus, they believe that they should be used only to link clauses within a sentence. AHD4 states that &quot;it may be used to begin a sentence at all levels of style.&quot;

== C ==

* and – Some argue that &quot;can&quot; refers to possibility and &quot;may&quot; refers to permission, and insist on maintaining this distinction, although usage of &quot;can&quot; to refer to permission is pervasive in spoken and very frequent in written English. M-W notes: &quot;&quot;Can&quot; and &quot;may&quot; are most frequently interchangeable in senses denoting possibility; because the possibility of one&#x27;s doing something may (or can) depend on another&#x27;s acquiescence, they have also become interchangeable in the sense denoting permission. The use of &quot;can&quot; to ask or grant permission has been common since the 19th century and is well established, although some commentators feel &quot;may&quot; is more appropriate in formal contexts. &quot;May&quot; is relatively rare in negative constructions (&quot;mayn&#x27;t&quot; is not common); &quot;cannot&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; are usual in such contexts.&quot; AHD4 echoes this sentiment of formality, noting that only 21% of the Usage Panel accepted &quot;can&quot; in the example &quot;Can I take another week to submit the application?&quot;. For its part, OED labels the use of &quot;can&quot; for &quot;may&quot; as &quot;colloquial&quot;.
* – &quot;Comprise&quot; means &quot;to consist of&quot;. A second meaning, &quot;to compose or constitute&quot;, as in &quot;comprised of&quot;, is sometimes attacked by usage writers. However, it is supported as sense 3 along with a usage note in M-W. AHD5 notes: &quot;Our surveys show that opposition to this usage has abated but has not disappeared. In the 1960s, 53 percent of the Usage Panel found this usage unacceptable; by 1996, the proportion objecting had declined to 35 percent; and by 2011, it had fallen a bit more, to 32 percent.&quot; &quot;Collins&quot; gives a usage note: &quot;The use of &quot;of&quot; after comprise should be avoided: the library comprises (not of) 500 000 books and manuscripts&quot;. Some usage writers further say to use comprise only for exhaustive inclusion. Reuters suggests &quot;Use only when listing all the component parts of a whole&quot;.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: The English Wikipedia comprises more than five million articles.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: More than five million articles are comprised in the English Wikipedia.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The English Wikipedia of more than five million articles.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The English Wikipedia is of more than five million articles.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: More than five million articles comprise the English Wikipedia.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: Diatoms comprise more than 70% of all phytoplankton.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: &quot;Those in the industry have mostly scoffed at the young, inexperienced Carter and the rest of the high school pals that comprise the company.&quot;
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: &quot;Both the union and the league are many individuals, ...&quot;
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: &quot;The committee is several NBA owners, including committee chair Clay Bennett of Oklahoma City.&quot;
* – First used in the 1920s as a transitive verb meaning &quot;to get into contact or in touch with (a person)&quot;, AHD5 notes that its usefulness and popularity have worn down resistance. In 1969, only 34 percent of the Usage Panel accepted its use, but in 1988, 65 percent of the Panel accepted it in the sentence &quot;She immediately called an officer at the Naval Intelligence Service, who in turn contacted the FBI&quot;. In 2004, 94 percent accepted contact in this same sentence.

== D ==

* – The original meaning in English is &quot;deplore&quot; or &quot;express disapproval of&quot; (the Latin from which the word derives means &quot;pray to avert evil&quot;, suggesting that some event would be a calamity). The word is now also used to mean &quot;play down&quot;, &quot;belittle&quot; or &quot;devalue&quot;, a shift that some disapprove of, as it suggests the word is being confused with the similar word &quot;depreciate&quot;; in fact, AHD4 states that in this sense &quot;deprecate&quot; has almost completely supplanted &quot;depreciate&quot;; however, a majority of the dictionary&#x27;s Usage Panel approved this sense. Its use with the approximate meaning &quot;to declare obsolescent&quot; in computer jargon is also sometimes condemned.
* – Cochrane (2004) states that to &quot;diagnose [someone] with a disease&quot; is an incorrect usage of the verb &quot;diagnose&quot;, which takes the physician as subject and a disease as object (e.g. &quot;to diagnose cancer&quot;). In American English, according to AHD4 and M-W, the sense of &quot;diagnose [someone] with a disease&quot; is listed without comment or tag; however, for its part, RH does not list such a usage, with or without comment. For British English, COD11 offers &quot;identify the medical condition of (someone): &quot;she was diagnosed as having epilepsy&quot; (2004); this usage, however, did not appear in editions as recently as the 1990s. Chambers does not offer this sense at all.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: Mr. Smith was diagnosed with diabetes.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: The doctor diagnosed diabetes.
* – Standard usage in both the UK and USA is &quot;different from&quot; (on the analogy of &quot;to differ from&quot;). In the UK, this competes with &quot;different to&quot; (coined on the analogy of &quot;similar to&quot;). In America, it competes with &quot;different than&quot; (coined on the analogy of &quot;other than&quot;). &quot;Different to&quot; is also found in Irish, South African, Australian, and New Zealand English.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: The American pronunciation of English is different from the British.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The American pronunciation of English is different to the British.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The American pronunciation of English is different than the British.
* – Standard usage is as a word for &quot;unbiased,&quot; but some have also rendered it synonymous with &quot;uninterested&quot;.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: As their mutual best friend, I tried to remain disinterested in their argument so as not to anger either.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The key to attracting a member of the opposite sex is to balance between giving attention to him or her and appearing disinterested.
* – The adjectival use of &quot;due to&quot; is undisputed. Its adverbial use, however, has been a subject of dispute for many years, as witnessed by several (especially U.S.) dictionary usage notes that in the end designate it as &quot;standard.&quot; William Strunk, in his &quot;Elements of Style&quot;, labelled the disputed adverbial use of &quot;due to&quot; as &quot;incorrect.&quot; Although the first (1926) edition of Fowler condemned the adverbial use as &quot;common ... only ... among the illiterate&quot;, the third (1996) edition said, &quot;Opinion remains sharply divided, but it begins to look as if this use of &quot;due to&quot; will form part of the natural language of the 21., as one more example of a forgotten battle.&quot; &quot;Due to&quot; is frequently used in place of &quot;by&quot;, &quot;from&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;because of&quot;, and other prepositions and prepositional phrases. Undisputed synonyms for &quot;due to&quot; are &quot;caused by&quot; and &quot;attributable to&quot;.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: He died due to cancer. &quot;(He died of cancer.)&quot;
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: Due to the end of the Second War, circumstances altered profoundly. &quot;(With the end of the Second War, circumstances altered profoundly.)&quot;
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: His death was due to cancer.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: Many thought the problem was due to mismanagement.

== E ==

* – Frequently used as a synonym for &quot;enormousness&quot; or &quot;immensity&quot;, but traditionally means &quot;extreme wickedness&quot;. According to AHD4, this distinction has not always occurred historically, but is now supported by 59% of the dictionary&#x27;s Usage Panel. COD11 states that &quot;enormity&quot; as a synonym for &quot;hugeness&quot; &quot;is now broadly accepted as standard English.&quot; Although Chambers lists &quot;immenseness or vastness&quot; as a meaning, it says it &quot;should not be used&quot; in that sense, commenting that it is encountered often because the word &quot;enormousness&quot; is &quot;awkward&quot;; it recommends using instead another word, such as &quot;hugeness, greatness,&quot; etc.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The enormity of the elephant astounded me.
** &quot;Traditional usage&quot;: The enormity of Stalin&#x27;s purges astounds me.

* and – Many adhere to the rule that &quot;farther&quot; only should refer to matters of physical distance or position, while &quot;further&quot; should be reserved for more abstract usages involving time or degree (as well as undisputed descriptions of &quot;moreover&quot; and &quot;in addition&quot;).
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: San Jose is further from L.A. than Santa Barbara.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: L.A. was a couple of hours farther from home than I expected.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: If her fever increases any farther, I will call the doctor.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: I would like to discuss the issue further at a later time.
* – Used by some interchangeably with &quot;fortunately&quot;, strictly speaking &quot;fortuitousness&quot; is a reference to an occurrence depending on chance. M-W notes that use of the word in the sense of &quot;fortunate&quot; has been standard for at least 70 years, and notes that the sense of &quot;coming or happening by a lucky chance&quot; is virtually unnoticed by usage critics.

== G ==

* – &quot;Gender&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;sex&quot; in the sense of the biological or social qualities, &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;. It is never used to refer to sexual intercourse.
**&quot;Gender&quot; traditionally refers to grammatical gender, a feature in the grammar of a number of different languages. Some argue that its use as a euphemism for &quot;sex&quot; is to be avoided as a genteelism; Fowler (p. 211) says it is used &quot;either as a jocularity ... or a blunder.&quot;
** &quot;Sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot; can be used in different but related senses, with &quot;sex&quot; referring to biological characteristics and &quot;gender&quot; to social roles and expectations based on sex. Use of &quot;gender&quot; as interchangeable with or as a replacement for &quot;sex&quot; may confuse readers who draw this distinction. &quot;See gender identity, gender role.&quot;

== H ==

* – The question surrounding &quot;hoi polloi&quot; is whether it is appropriate to use the article &quot;the&quot; preceding the phrase; it arises because &quot;οἱ&quot; (&quot;hoi&quot;) is the Greek word for &quot;the&quot; in the phrase and classical purists complain that adding &quot;the&quot; makes the phrase redundant: &quot;the the common people&quot;. Foreign phrases borrowed into English are often reanalyzed as single grammatical units, requiring an English article in appropriate contexts. AHD4 says &quot;The Arabic element &quot;al-&quot; means &#x27;the&#x27;, and appears in English nouns such as &quot;alcohol&quot; and &quot;alchemy&quot;. Thus, since no one would consider a phrase such as &quot;the alcohol&quot; to be redundant, criticizing &quot;the hoi polloi&quot; on similar grounds seems pedantic.&quot;
* – Some argue this word should not be used as an expression of confidence in an outcome; however, M-W classes &quot;hopefully&quot; with other words such as &quot;interestingly&quot;, &quot;frankly&quot;, and &quot;unfortunately&quot; (which are unremarkably used in a similar way) as disjuncts, and describes this usage as &quot;entirely standard&quot;. AHD4, however, notes that opposition to this usage by their usage panels has grown from 56% to 73%, despite support for similar disjuncts (such as 60% support for the use of &quot;mercifully&quot; in &quot;Mercifully, the game ended before the opponents could add another touchdown to the lopsided score&quot;). AHD4 opines that this opposition is not to the use of these adverbs in general, but that this use of &quot;hopefully&quot; has become a &quot;shibboleth&quot;. OED lists this usage without any &quot;colloquial&quot; or other label, other than to say &quot;Avoided by many writers&quot;. See also the discussion of &quot;hopefully&quot; as a dangling modifier. One investigation in modern corpora on Language Log revealed that outside fiction, where it still represents 40% of all uses (the other qualifying primarily speech and gazes), disjunct uses account for the vast majority (over 90%) of all uses of the word.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: &quot;Hopefully, I shall be spared the guillotine&quot;, the prisoner thought.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: Hopefully, the prisoner approached the guillotine. His hope was misplaced.
* – The &quot;Compact Oxford Dictionary&quot; from 1996 has a usage note criticizing use of &quot;humanitarian&quot; as in &quot;humanitarian disaster&quot;, saying &quot;the adjective &quot;humanitarian&quot; is often used inaccurately by reporters, e.g &quot;This is the worst humanitarian disaster within living memory&quot;, as if &quot;humanitarian&quot; meant &#x27;of or relating to humanity, though the current entry given by OxfordDictionaries.com has a more tempered commentary: &quot;The primary sense of humanitarian is &#x27;concerned with or seeking to promote human welfare.&#x27; Since the 1930s, a new sense, exemplified by phrases such as &quot;the worst humanitarian disaster this country has seen&quot;, has been gaining currency, and is now broadly established, especially in journalism, although it is not considered good style by all&quot;. Most dictionaries are implicitly neutral, giving no sense covering this usage but neither any usage comment criticizing it. However, besides the current OxfordDictionaries.com entry, Random House Dictionary, the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, and the Macmillan Dictionary all give senses for the use in &quot;humanitarian disaster&quot;.

== I ==

* – A large majority of the AHD Usage Panel has disapproved of the use of the verb meaning &quot;to have an effect&quot; since the early 1980s. Even in its 2001 survey, 85 percent of the Panel rejected the intransitive use in the sentence &quot;These policies are impacting on our ability to achieve success&quot;, and 80 percent rejected the transitive use in the sentence &quot;The court ruling will impact the education of minority students&quot;.
* – Irony refers to an incongruity between what is expected and what actually occurs, especially if what actually occurs thwarts human wishes or designs. People often misuse &quot;ironic&quot;, applying it to events and circumstances that are simply &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or &quot;&quot;. In AHD&#x27;s 1987 survey, 78 percent of the Usage Panel rejected the use of &quot;ironically&quot; in the sentence &quot;In 1969 Susan moved from Ithaca to California where she met her husband-to-be, who, ironically, also came from upstate New York&quot;. By contrast, 73 percent accepted the sentence &quot;Ironically, even as the government was fulminating against American policy, American jeans and videocassettes were the hottest items in the stalls of the market&quot;, where the incongruity can be seen as an example of human inconsistency.

== L ==

* and – &quot;Lay&quot; is a transitive verb, requiring a direct object. &quot;Lay&quot; and its principal derivatives (&quot;laid&quot;, &quot;laying&quot;) are correctly used in these examples: &quot;Now I lay me down to sleep. The chicken is laying an egg.&quot; &quot;Lie&quot; is an intransitive verb and cannot take an object. &quot;Lie&quot; and its principal derivatives (&quot;lay&quot;, &quot;lain&quot;, &quot;lying&quot;) are correctly used in these examples: &quot;My mother lies &quot;[not&quot; lays&quot;]&quot; down after meals. I fell asleep as soon as I lay &quot;[not&quot; laid&quot;]&quot; on the sand. The bills had lain &quot;[not&quot; laid&quot;]&quot; there all week. I was lying &quot;[not&quot; laying&quot;]&quot; in my nest when she rang.&quot;·
* – Some argue that &quot;less&quot; should not be substituted for &quot;&quot;. Merriam-Webster notes &quot;The traditional view is that &quot;less&quot; applies to matters of degree, value, or amount and modifies collective nouns, mass nouns, or nouns denoting an abstract whole while &quot;fewer&quot; applies to matters of number and modifies plural nouns. &quot;Less&quot; has been used to modify plural nouns since the days of King Alfred and the usage, though roundly decried, appears to be increasing. &quot;Less&quot; is more likely than &quot;fewer&quot; to modify plural nouns when distances, sums of money, and a few fixed phrases are involved &lt;&quot;less&quot; than 100 miles&gt; &lt;an investment of &quot;less&quot; than $2000&gt; &lt;in 25 words or &quot;less&quot;&gt; and as likely as &quot;fewer&quot; to modify periods of time &lt;in &quot;less&quot; (or &quot;fewer&quot;) than four hours&gt;.&quot;
**&quot;Disputed usage&quot;: This lane 12 items or less.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: We had fewer players on the team this season.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: There is less water in the tank now.
* and – Some object to the use of &quot;like&quot; as a conjunction, stating it is rather a preposition and that only &quot;as&quot; would be appropriate in this circumstance. M-W, however, cites &quot;like&quot; use as a conjunction as standard since the 14th century, and opines that opposition to it is &quot;perhaps more heated than rational&quot; (see M-W&#x27;s entry &quot;like [7, conjunction]&quot;). AHD4 says &quot;Writers since Chaucer&#x27;s time have used like as a conjunction, but 19th-century and 20th-century critics have been so vehement in their condemnations of this usage that a writer who uses the construction in formal style risks being accused of illiteracy or worse&quot;, and recommends using &quot;as&quot; in formal speech and writing. OED does not tag it as colloquial or nonstandard, but notes, &quot;Used as conj[unction]: = &#x27;like as&#x27;, as. Now generally condemned as vulgar or slovenly, though examples may be found in many recent writers of standing.&quot; Chambers lists the conjunctive use as &quot;colloquial&quot;.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;. He is an American as am I.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;. He is an American like me.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;. It looks as if this play will be a flop.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;. This play looks like a flop.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;. He is an American like I am.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;. It looks like this play will be a flop.
* – Some argue &quot;literally&quot; should not be used as a mere emphatic, unless the thing to which it refers is actually true. It is used to disambiguate a possible metaphorical interpretation of a phrase. M-W does not condemn the second use, which means &quot;in effect&quot; or &quot;virtually&quot;, but says &quot;the use is pure hyperbole intended to gain emphasis, but it often appears in contexts where no additional emphasis is necessary&quot;.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The party literally went off with a bang. [No, it did not, unless there was an actual loud noise.]
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: I literally ran more than 25 miles today. I ran a marathon.
* – The use of &quot;loan&quot; as a verb meaning &quot;to give out a loan&quot; is disputed, with &quot;lend&quot; being preferred for the verb form. AHD4 flatly states &quot;[t]he verb loan is well established in American usage and cannot be considered incorrect&quot;; M-W states &quot;... loan is entirely standard as a verb&quot;. RH says &quot;Sometimes mistakenly identified as an Americanism, &quot;loan&quot; as a verb meaning &quot;to lend&quot; has been used in English for nearly 800 years&quot;; it further states that objections to this use &quot;are comparatively recent&quot;. Chambers defines the verb &quot;loan&quot; as &quot;to lend (especially money)&quot;. OED merely states &quot;Now chiefly U.S.&quot;, and COD11 includes the meaning without tag or comment.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: I lent him some money.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: Fill out the paperwork for a loan.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: I loaned him some money.

== M ==
* – Some state that as a transitive verb in the context &quot;to come together by chance or arrangement&quot;, &quot;meet&quot; (as in &quot;meet (someone)&quot;) does not require a preposition between verb and object; the phrase &quot;meet with (someone)&quot; is deemed incorrect. Chambers flags this usage &quot;US&quot;; RH allows it in the sense of &quot;to join, as for conference or instruction: &quot;I met with her an hour a day until we solved the problem.&quot;&quot; On the other hand, none of M-W, AHD4, or COD11 entertains this usage. NOTE: In the sense of fulfilling prerequisites or criteria (&quot;We met with the entry requirements&quot;), or that of encountering (&quot;Our suggestions may meet with opposition; the soldiers met with machine-gun fire&quot;), the verb phrase &quot;meet with&quot; is not in dispute.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: I will meet with you tonight.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: I will meet you tonight.
* – Traditionally, &quot;momentarily&quot; means &quot;for a moment&quot;, but its use to mean &quot;in a moment&quot; is disputed. M-W and RH give this latter usage a standard entry without comment, while OED and Chambers tag it &quot;N.Amer.&quot; AHD5 has a usage note indicating that 68% of their Usage Panel deems this usage &quot;acceptable&quot;. See also List of commonly misused English words#M.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: Ladies and gentlemen, the captain wishes to inform you the plane will be in the air momentarily.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: The flash from the atom bomb momentarily lit up the night sky.

== N ==

* – Traditionally &quot;nauseous&quot; means &quot;causing nausea&quot; (synonymous with &quot;nauseating&quot;); it is commonly used now as a synonym for &quot;queasy,&quot; that is, having the feeling of nausea. AHD4 notes the traditional view, stating that 72% of the Usage Panel preferred &quot;nauseated&quot; over &quot;nauseous&quot; to mean &quot;affected with nausea&quot;; however, 88% of that same panel preferred &quot;nauseating&quot; to &quot;nauseous&quot; to mean &quot;causing nausea&quot;; in other words, a maximum of only 28% prefers &quot;nauseous&quot; in either case. It also states that in common usage, &quot;nauseous&quot; is synonymous with &quot;nauseated&quot;. M-W, however, asserts that &quot;[t]hose who insist that nauseous ... is an error for nauseated are mistaken&quot;. Both M-W and AHD4 accept that &quot;nauseous&quot; is supplanting &quot;nauseated&quot; for &quot;feeling nausea&quot;, and in turn being replaced by &quot;nauseating&quot; for &quot;causing nausea&quot; in general usage; they only differ on the correctness of the change. RH states &quot;The two literal senses of nauseous [...] appear in English at almost the same time in the early 17th century, and both senses are in standard use at the present time. &quot;Nauseous&quot; is more common than &quot;nauseated&quot; in the sense &#x27;affected with nausea&#x27;, despite recent objections by those who imagine the sense to be new.&quot; CHAMBERS lists the sense of causing nausea first and affected with nausea second, while COD11 gives the affliction first and causation second; both dictionaries list the entries without comment. OED goes further, tagging its &quot;nauseated&quot; usage as &quot;Orig[inally] U.S.&quot;, but demoted its &quot;nauseating&quot; usage to &quot;literary&quot;. OED also notes that the original (now obsolete) sense of the word in English was &quot;inclined to sickness or nausea; squeamish&quot;. Curiously, this oldest seventeenth-century meaning (inclined to nausea), while distinct from the disputed twentieth-century usage (afflicted by nausea), more closely resembles the latter than it does the prescribed meaning (causing nausea).
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: That smell is nauseous.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: That smell is making me nauseous.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: That smell is nauseating.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: That smell is making me nauseated.
** &quot;Obsolete usage&quot;: You should not invite him to go fishing next week, as he is quite nauseous.
** &quot;Obsolete usage&quot;: As she was a nauseous woman by nature, she avoided fishmongers&#x27; and butchers&#x27; shops.

== O ==

* – Fowler notes that some editors regard this as an Americanism. The American source M-W&#x27;s &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage&quot;, 1989, eventually settles on accepting it, but has this to say: &quot;Bache 1869 and Ayres 1881 succinctly insulted contemporaries who used this word, calling them vulgar and unschooled. Times have changed: modern critics merely insult the word itself. Follett 1966, for example, claims that overly is useless, superfluous, and unharmonious, and should be replaced by the prefix over-. Bryson 1984 adds that &#x27;when this becomes overinelegant ... the alternative is to find another adverb [...]&#x27;.&quot; The prefix &quot;over-&quot; is safer, and accepted by all: &quot;He seemed over-anxious.&quot; M-W, AHD4, and RH include the word without comment, and OED notes only &quot;After the Old English period, &quot;rare&quot; (outside Scotland and North America) until the 20th cent.&quot; In most cases &quot;too&quot; or &quot;excessively&quot; would be better choices than &quot;over-&quot;.

== P ==

* originally meant a joke or witticism (as in French &quot;plaisanterie&quot;). It is now generally used to mean only polite conversation in general (as in the phrase &quot;exchange of pleasantries&quot;). 
* and – Today, all major style guides recommend &quot;people.&quot; For example, the Associated Press and the New York Times recommend &quot;people&quot; except in quotations and set phrases. Under the traditional distinction, which Garner says is pedantic, &quot;persons&quot; describes a finite, known number of individuals, rather than the collective term &quot;people&quot;. This debate raged towards the end of the 19th century. &quot;Persons&quot; is correct in technical and legal contexts.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: There are 15 people registered to attend.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: There are countless people online at this moment.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: The law makes special provision for children and young persons.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: In Christian theology there are three persons in the Trinity.
* – Traditionally, &quot;presently&quot; is held to mean &quot;after a short period of time&quot; or &quot;soon&quot;. It is also used in the sense &quot;at the present time&quot; or &quot;now&quot;, a usage which is disapproved of by many, though in medieval and Elizabethan times &quot;presently&quot; meant &quot;now&quot; (but in the sense of &quot;immediately&quot; rather than &quot;currently&quot;). RH dates the sense of &quot;now&quot; back to the 15th century—noting it is &quot;in standard use in all varieties of speech and writing in both Great Britain and the United States&quot;—and dates the appearance of the sense of &quot;soon&quot; to the 16th century. It considers the modern objection to the older sense &quot;strange&quot;, and comments that the two senses are &quot;rarely if ever confused in actual practice. &quot;Presently&quot; meaning &#x27;now&#x27; is most often used with the present tense &quot;(The professor is presently on sabbatical leave)&quot; and &quot;presently&quot; meaning &#x27;soon&#x27; often with the future tense &quot;(The supervisor will be back presently)&quot;.&quot; M-W mentions the same vintage for the sense of &quot;now&quot;, and that &quot;it is not clear why it is objectionable.&quot; AHD4 states that despite its use &quot;nowadays in literate speech and writing&quot; that there is still &quot; lingering prejudice against this use&quot;. In the late 1980s, only 50% of the dictionary&#x27;s Usage Panel approved of the sentence &quot;General Walters is … presently the United States Ambassador to the United Nations&quot;. COD11 lists both usages without comment; CHAMBERS merely flags the sense of &quot;now&quot; as &quot;N Amer, especially US&quot;.

== R ==
* and – Some people argue that &quot;raise&quot; should not be used to mean an upbringing of a being, since &quot;raise&quot; originally meant to cause something or someone to rise, and &quot;rear&quot; meant to bring up something or someone. Although &quot;raise&quot; was formerly condemned in this sense, it may now be considered standard, at least with regard to animals, and is common at least informally with regard to human children.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: You rear hogs, but you raise children.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: You raise hogs, but you rear children.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: You rear hogs, and you rear children.
* and – According to traditional rules of English grammar, &quot;raise is almost always used transitively&quot;, whereas &quot;rise is almost exclusively intransitive in its standard uses&quot;. However, because of their similar meanings, they may be used by many informal speakers as though they were interchangeable.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The elevator was raising.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The elevator was being risen.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: The elevator was rising.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: The elevator was being raised.
* – The traditional meaning of &quot;refute&quot; is &quot;disprove&quot; or &quot;dispel with reasoned arguments&quot;. It is now often used as a synonym for &quot;deny&quot;. The latter sense is listed without comment by M-W and AHD4, while CHAMBERS tags it as colloquial. COD11 states that &quot;Traditionalists object to [the use of &quot;refute&quot; as &quot;deny&quot;], but it is now widely accepted in standard English.&quot; However, RH does not mention this use at all. &quot;Refute&quot; is also often confused with ; a &quot;&quot;, in formal debate terms, is a counter-refutation, and it also has a specific legal sense, though like &quot;refutation&quot;, the word has taken on the informal and disputed meaning of &quot;denial&quot;.
* – Literally meaning &quot;compared with&quot;, some now use &quot;relatively&quot; to mean &quot;moderately&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; (perhaps in the sense of &quot;compared to the average or to the expectation&quot;). AHD4 does not list this usage at all; M-W has apparently blended the two usages into one.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: That man was relatively annoying.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: Though relatively harmless when compared with dimethylmercury, mercury (II) oxide is still quite toxic.

== S ==

* , and – Formerly, &quot;Scotch&quot; was used as an alternative for &quot;Scots&quot; or &quot;Scottish&quot;. The current convention is as follows:
** &quot;Scottish&quot; for most purposes, including people, animals, and things in general.
** &quot;Scots&quot; also for people, and for identifiably human matters and institutions (e.g., &quot;the Scots&quot;, &quot;Scotsmen&quot;; &quot;Scots Law&quot; (capitalised); &quot;the Scots language&quot;, which is never &quot;the Scottish language&quot;; rarely &quot;Scots culture&quot;, which is more commonly &quot;Scottish culture&quot;). It appears in combining form in &quot;Scots-Irish&quot;. The &quot;Scots pine&quot; is named after Scotland, though not limited to it.
** &quot;Scotch&quot; is sometimes (and decreasingly) used for foods produced in Scotland (e.g., &quot;Scotch salmon&quot;, &quot;Scotch tomatoes&quot;; more commonly &quot;Scottish&quot;), and always for &quot;Scotch whisky&quot; (never &quot;Scottish whisky&quot;). It also appears in &quot;Scotch bonnet&quot;, &quot;Scotch egg&quot;, &quot;Scotch broth&quot; and the &quot;scotch doubles&quot; tournament format (which is usually lower-cased); and in the &quot;Scotch Game&quot; or &quot;Scotch Opening&quot; in chess. &quot;Scotch&quot; is otherwise best avoided, especially as applied to people, as Scots themselves consider it offensive, including the archaic &quot;Scotchmen&quot;.
:There is also the unrelated verb &quot;&quot; (also lower-cased), as in the following example from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;:
:* &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: &quot;We have scotched the snake, not killed it.&quot;

* – This means &quot;look for&quot;, but is sometimes used to mean &quot;try&quot; or &quot;want&quot;. The latter usage is criticised by Fowler in the entry &quot;Formal Words&quot;.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: &quot;... we did seek to resolve the Iraq crisis by peaceful means ... those who seek to emulate his legacy of murder ... the Liberals seek to undermine that future ...&quot;
:* &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: &quot;Seek and ye shall find.&quot;

== T ==

* – &quot;Than&quot; is the subject of a longstanding dispute as to its status as a preposition or conjunction. 
* – Originally the third person plural pronoun, but sometimes used with a singular meaning. It may be used to refer either to an indefinite individual, or to a specific individual of unknown, unspecified, or non-binary gender. This singular usage has traditionally been considered informal but is becoming more accepted in formal writing. For example, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2015 deemed it permissible as a last resort. The Chicago Manual of Style in 2017 acklowledged its growing popularity but still recommended avoiding it when possible.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: A person is rude if they show no respect for their hosts.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: One is rude if one shows no respect for one&#x27;s hosts.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: It is rude not to show respect for hosts.
* – &quot;Thusly&quot; (AHD4 suggests) was originally coined by educated writers to make fun of uneducated people trying to sound genteel. The word &quot;thusly&quot; appears with no associated usage notes in M-W; COD11 tags it as &quot;informal&quot;, with the entry &quot;thus&quot; tagged as &quot;literary or formal&quot;. CHAMBERS does not list the word at all, and it is unknown in British usage. MAU considers it a nonword and laments that it appears in otherwise respectable writing. However, &quot;thusly&quot; has diffused into popular usage. Some people accept it as an adverb in its own right, while others believe should be used in all cases.

== U ==

* – Some usage critics and style guides have argued that &quot;unique&quot; means only &quot;sole&quot; or &quot;without equal&quot;. The AP Stylebook says &quot;it means one of a kind. Do not describe something as &quot;rather unique&quot;, &quot;most unique&quot;, or &quot;very unique&quot;&quot; but most dictionaries do give a third meaning: &quot;unusual&quot;, which can be qualified by, &quot;quite&quot;, &quot;very&quot;, &quot;somewhat&quot;, as in &quot;The theme of the party was somewhat unique&quot; (see &quot;comparison&quot;). M-W has a usage note under its entry for &quot;unique&quot;, which says in part &quot;Many commentators have objected to the comparison or modification (as by somewhat or very) of unique, often asserting that a thing is either unique or it is not. Objections are based chiefly on the assumption that unique has but a single absolute sense, an assumption contradicted by information readily available in a dictionary.&quot; &quot;The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage&quot; is quite plain in its disagreement with the critics: 
:* &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: &quot;As documented in depth by the Boston Globe, Massachusetts high schools feature some of the most uniquely oriented fields in all of baseball.&quot; &quot;None of those may be more unique than the field that Braintree (Mass.) High calls home.&quot; &quot;The setting has required some rather unique rule modifications to work in the town hall.&quot; &quot;While French&#x27;s Common may be the Bay State&#x27;s most unique park, it certainly isn&#x27;t alone.&quot;

* – The primary meaning of &quot;urgent&quot; is as a description of a pressing need. Especially in journalistic contexts, it is sometimes used by transference to describe the thing needed, or to mean &quot;happening very soon&quot;.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: There is an urgent need for talks
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: There is a need for urgent talks
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: The President promised that urgent talks would be held

== W ==

* and – &quot;Penguin Working Words&quot; recommends &quot;while&quot; only, and notes that &quot;whilst&quot; is old-fashioned. &quot;Cambridge Guide to English Usage&quot; and M-W&#x27;s &quot;Webster&#x27;s Guide to English Usage&quot; comment on its regional character, and note that it is rare in American usage. It is thus safer to use only &quot;while&quot; in international English. Both &quot;whilst&quot; and &quot;amongst&quot; are excrescent inflections of the more standard &quot;while&quot; and &quot;among&quot;, and could be classified as grammatically incorrect; however, other excrescent inflections are widely accepted in Modern English (&quot;against&quot;, &quot;midst&quot;, etc.), and some others are widely encountered in both forms (&quot;amid&quot; and &quot;amidst&quot;, &quot;among&quot; and &quot;amongst&quot;). Although &quot;against&quot; has no widely acceptable alternative, &quot;mid-&quot; or &quot;middle&quot; can be substituted for some uses of &quot;midst&quot; (the stock phrase &quot;in their/our midst&quot; remains common and has no widely accepted alternative using &quot;mid&quot; or &quot;middle&quot;).
* – Some argue that &quot;who&quot; should be used only as a subject pronoun, the corresponding object pronoun being &quot;&quot;. Strictly speaking, using &quot;who&quot; instead of &quot;whom&quot; is substituting a subjective pronoun for an objective pronoun and hence is the same as using &quot;she&quot; instead of &quot;her&quot; (e.g., &quot;I saw she today.&quot;). Most people never use &quot;whom&quot; in spoken English and instead use &quot;who&quot; for all cases. Those who use &quot;whom&quot; in everyday speech may recognize substitution of &quot;who&quot; as substandard. &quot;Fowler&#x27;s&quot; has an extensive entry on &quot;who and whom&quot; including several quotes from major publications where &quot;whom&quot; is used incorrectly.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: You are talking to whom?
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: You are talking to who?
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: To whom are you talking?
** &quot;Widely disputed usage&quot;: To who are you talking?
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: Who are you talking to?
** &quot;Incorrect usage&quot;: &quot;... far more hostile to Diana whom she believes betrayed the Prince of Wales&quot; – &quot;Independent Magazine&quot;, 1993 (FOWLER)
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: &quot;... far more hostile to Diana who she believes betrayed the Prince of Wales&quot;
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: &quot;Whom do men say that I am?&quot; (Mark 9:27, King James Version)
* – This extension of &quot;who&quot; (see above) along with its object form &quot;whomever&quot; is attended by the same uncertainties as &quot;who&quot; along with &quot;whom&quot;, and is discussed in the same sources. (See the relevant section at Who.)
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: Give it to whoever wants it.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: Give it to whoever you think should have it.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: Give it to whomever you choose to give it.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: Give it to whoever you choose to give it to.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: Give it to whomever wants it.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: Give it to whomever you think should have it.
* – The use of &quot;whose&quot; to refer to non-persons (called inanimate &quot;whose&quot;) has drawn criticism from those who note that it derives from &quot;who&quot;, which can be used only with persons and the personified. English lacks a possessive form of &quot;which&quot;, so there is no word that could substitute for &quot;whose&quot; in the disputed example below to make it undisputed; the sentence would have to be reworded. Usually that is done with &quot;of which&quot; constructions, though these can sometimes be awkward or stilted and may inspire further rewriting.
** &quot;Undisputed usage&quot;: That&#x27;s the woman &quot;whose&quot; husband keeps waking us up at night.
** &quot;Disputed usage&quot;: That&#x27;s the car &quot;whose&quot; alarm keeps waking us up at night.
** &quot;Undisputed rewording, but potentially stilted:&quot; That&#x27;s the car of which the alarm keeps waking us up at night.
** &quot;Undisputed rewording:&quot; That car&#x27;s alarm is the one that keeps waking us up at night.

<text>The human cannonball act is a performance in which a person who acts as the &quot;cannonball&quot; is ejected from a cylinder that has been specially designed to resemble a cannon. The human cannonball lands on a horizontal net or inflated bag placed at the predicted landing point. Outdoor performances may aim at a body of water.

==History==

The first human cannonball, launched in 1877 at the Royal Aquarium in London, was the 17-year-old Rossa Matilda Richter, going by the stage name &quot;Zazel&quot;. She was launched by a spring-style cannon invented by the Canadian William Leonard Hunt (&quot;The Great Farini&quot;). She later toured with the P.T. Barnum Circus. Farini&#x27;s cannon used rubber springs to launch a person from the cannon, limiting the distance they could be launched. Richter&#x27;s career as a human cannonball ended when she broke her back during an unrelated tightrope act.

During World War I, Ildebrando Zacchini proposed using spring-loaded cannons to shoot Italian soldiers across enemy lines, but the Italian government considered the plan too risky. In Cairo in 1922, Zacchini invented a cannon that used compressed air to launch a human. He first tested his new cannon with his son Bruno Zacchini, and after traveling back to Italy, Ringling Brothers scouts invited the Zacchini family to the United States. Members of the Zacchini family were later inducted into the Ringling Brothers Circus Hall of Fame.

==Cannon mechanics==
The impetus in the cannon is provided either by a spring or jet of compressed air. This makes the device work more like a catapult, where the cylinder propelling the human stops at the mouth of the cannon. Some cannons utilize nitrocellulose, specifically the dinitrate ester, cellulose dinitrate (pyroxylin).

In a circus performance, gunpowder may be used to provide visual and auditory effects unrelated to the launching mechanism. Fireworks and smoke may also be used to increase the visual effect.

The largest retailer of these human cannons is located in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. This supplier provides approximately 80% of all human cannon catapults.

==World record==
There is a claim that the current world record for the longest human cannonball flight is , established by David &quot;The Bullet&quot; Smith Jr. on the set of &quot;Lo Show dei Record&quot;, in Milan, Italy, on March 10, 2011. The distance was measured from the mouth of the cannon to the farthest point reached on the net. Smith was launched by an 8 m (26&#x27; 3&quot;) long cannon. It was estimated that he traveled at a speed of 120 km/h (74.6 mph), reaching a maximum altitude of 23 m (75&#x27; 6&quot;).

There is, however, a contradictory claim that Smith&#x27;s father, David &quot;Cannonball&quot; Smith Sr., set a record of , on August 31, 2002, at The Steele County Free Fair, in Owatonna, Minnesota. It is estimated that Smith Sr. traveled at over during the flight.


==Risk==
More than 30 human cannonballs have died during the performance of this stunt. Among the latest was that which occurred in Kent, United Kingdom on April 25, 2011, where a human cannonball died as a result of the failure of the safety net. Landing is considered to be the most dangerous aspect of the act.
==Special forces==
The human cannonball principle is the subject of a patent application by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, whereby a rail-guided chair driven by compressed air is brought to a sudden stop, propelling the special forces member, police officer or firefighter onto the roof of a tall building.

<text>Muzz Skillings (born January 6, 1964, in Queens, New York) is an American bassist, singer, guitarist and songwriter. He is best known for being the original bassist with Living Colour.

Skillings played bass, sang backing vocals, and co-wrote songs on the Grammy award-winning 1988 debut album &quot;Vivid&quot;, the Grammy award-winning 1990 follow up &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot;, and the 1991 EP &quot;Biscuits&quot;. His use of melodic, complex and moving bass lines during his time with Living Colour left him with high acclaim from musicians worldwide.

Skillings&#x27;s departure from the band in 1992 was due to musical differences and a desire to branch off and evolve musically outside of Living Colour. He left under good terms (as indicated in his liner notes printed in the album sleeve of Living Colour&#x27;s 1995 best-of compilation, &quot;Pride&quot;) and has returned to the band on occasion to substitute for their current bassist Doug Wimbish.

Skillings has since led a band called Medicine Stick, in which he plays electric guitar and sings lead vocals, as well as writes the songs.

<doc id="314680" wikidata="Q1517660" url="?curid=314680" title="The Mask of Dimitrios">
<text>The Mask of Dimitrios is a 1944 American film noir starring Sydney Greenstreet, Zachary Scott, Faye Emerson, Peter Lorre, and Victor Francen. Directed by Jean Negulesco, it was written by Frank Gruber, based on the 1939 novel of the same title written by Eric Ambler. Scott played the title role, of Dimitrios Makropoulos, in his film debut.

==Plot==
In 1938, the Dutch mystery writer Cornelius Leyden is visiting Istanbul. At an evening soiree, a fan, Colonel Haki of the Turkish police, believes he would be interested in the story of international intriguer and master criminal Dimitrios Makropoulos, whose body was just washed up on a local beach. Leyden is immediately captivated by what he learns about the Salonika-born one-time fig packer&#x27;s tale.

The two go to a mortuary to view the body, straining the timid writer&#x27;s stomach.

Haki then takes Leyden to meet a former lover of Dimitrios, now the madame at a local brothel, igniting a quest that will zig-zag him across Europe. Irana Preveza stoically relates her seduction, Dimitrios&#x27; sordid dealings, a high life together that came crashing down when he turned paid assassin. Recalling his flight, footsteps ahead of police, clutching borrowed francs left unpaid, leaves her doubled over in bitter tears.

Leyden leaves for Sophia, sharing an overnight train cabin with a congenial obese Englishman traveling on. Later, he catches the man ransacking his hotel room. Calling himself &quot;Peters&quot;, the intruder rants over betrayal by Dimitrios in a smuggling deal that sent him to prison. Suspicious of the report of his Istanbul death, Peters plans to blackmail him, now a respected Parisian banker, with the truth of his real identity. Offering a half share of a million French franc payoff, he seeks to inveigle Leyden in his scheme, but the Dutchman declines to become ensnared. Content to research his book, he follows a clue given him by Peters to Geneva.

There he meets the suave and aristocratic Wladislaw Grodek, a viper who had once hired Dimitrios to obtain some Yugoslavian military secrets. Dimitrios masterfully manipulated a meek minor government official into a gambling debt so great he handed over a strategic minefield chart to clear it. Caught, the mouse confessed and committed suicide; Dimitrios, playing both sides, double-crossed Grodek and sold the chart to a rival government.

Eventually, Peters sends Leyden to Paris, where he intends to spring his trap on Dimitrios. He does, and collects his million francs, but the pair is tracked by Makropoulos to a familiar lair. There Dimitrios coldly shoots Peters twice. Leyden, more angry than afraid, launches upon the assailant, sending his revolver flying. As they struggle Peters crawls to the gun, then holds Dimitrios at bay. He sends Leyden away, who hardly reaches the stairs before three shots are heard.

Police immediately arrive, and take the garrulous Peters into custody. Over his shoulder he bids farewell to Leyden, urging him to send on a copy of his book to him in prison.

==Background==
The novel was published in 1939. The character Dimitrios Makropoulos in Ambler&#x27;s book drew upon the early career of notorious munitions kingpin and &quot;merchant of death&quot; Sir Basil Zaharoff, whose life, wealth, and villainy were also portrayed in the titular character of the Orsen Welles mystery thriller Mr. Arkadin.

The assassination attempt involving Dimitrios was based a 1923 plot against the agrarian reform prime minister of Bulgaria, Aleksandar Stamboliyski, who survived the February 2, 1923 shooting but was murdered by right-wing secret police on June 14 following a successful &quot;coup d&#x27; etat&quot;.

==Production==
Film rights were bought by Warner Bros. The screenplay was assigned to A.I. Bezzerides with Henry Blanke to produce and Nancy Coleman and Helmut Dantine to star. Coleman did not like her role and Faye Emerson replaced her. Dantine was assigned to another film and replaced by Zachary Scott who had just impressed on Broadway in &quot;Those Endearing Young Charms&quot;; it was his first film.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review in June 1944: &quot;In telling the picaresque story of a mystery writer on the trail of a Levantine bum whose career of crime in the Balkans has stimulated the writer&#x27;s awe, the film wallows deeply in discourse and tediously trite flashbacks...To be sure, the Warner schemists have poured some scabby atmosphere into this film and have been very liberal with the scenery in picturing international haunts and Balkan dives...This sort of worldly melodrama calls for refinement in cinematic style, but the writing and direction of this picture betray a rather clumsy, conventional approach.&quot;

An undated UK Channel 4 review asserts that &quot;the film promises more action than it delivers, but there are opportunities for fine performances by Lorre and, especially, Greenstreet as the master crook. Atmospheric cinematography and an intriguing script turn this into a fine example of film noir with an immensely entertaining cast.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; called the movie &quot;One of the great film noir classics to come out of the 1940s, &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; boasts no superstars, just uniformly fine talents, a terrific script full of subtle intrigue and surprises, and Negulesco&#x27;s exciting direction. It&#x27;s an edge-of-the-seater all the way.&quot;

==Adaptation==
&quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; was adapted as a radio play aired on the April 16, 1945, broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, with Greenstreet and Lorre reprising their roles.

<text>Simon the Zealot (, ), also the Canaanite or the Canaanean (, ; ; ; ), was one of the apostles of Jesus. A few pseudepigraphical writings were connected to him, but Jerome does not include him in &quot;De viris illustribus&quot; written between 392 and 393 AD.

==Identity==
===Gospel-based traditions===
The name Simon occurs in all of the Synoptic Gospels and the Book of Acts each time there is a list of apostles, without further details:

To distinguish him from Simon Peter, he is given a surname in all three of the Synoptic Gospels where he is mentioned. Simon is called &quot;&quot;Zelotes&quot; in Luke and Acts ( ). For this reason, it is generally assumed that Simon was a former member of the political party, the Zealots. In Matthew and Mark, however, he is called &quot;Kananites&quot; in the Byzantine majority and &quot;Kananaios&quot;&quot; in the Alexandrian manuscripts and the Textus Receptus ( ). Both &quot;Kananaios&quot; and &quot;Kananites&quot; derive from the Hebrew word קנאי &quot;qanai&quot;, meaning &quot;&quot;, so most scholars today generally translate the two words to mean &quot;Zealot&quot;. However, Jerome and others, such as Bede, suggested that the word &quot;Kananaios&quot; or &quot;Kananite&quot; should be translated as &quot;Canaanean&quot; or &quot;Canaanite&quot;, meaning that Simon was from the town of קנה Cana in Galilee. If this is the case, his epithet would have been &quot;Kanaios&quot;.

Robert Eisenman has argued that contemporary talmudic references to Zealots refer to them as &quot;kanna&#x27;im&quot; &quot;but not really as a group—rather as avenging priests in the Temple&quot;. Eisenman&#x27;s broader conclusions, that the zealot element in the original apostle group was disguised and overwritten to make it support the assimilative Pauline Christianity of the Gentiles, are more controversial. John P. Meier argues that the term &quot;Zealot&quot; is a mistranslation and in the context of the Gospels means &quot;zealous&quot; or &quot;religious&quot; (in this case, for keeping the Law of Moses), as the Zealot movement apparently did not exist until 30 to 40 years after the events of the Gospels. However, neither Brandon nor Hengel support this view.

====Other identifications====
In the gospels Simon the Zealot is not directly identified with Simon the brother of Jesus mentioned in Mark 6:3:

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; suggests that Simon the Zealot may be the same person as Simeon of Jerusalem or Simon the brother of Jesus or both. He would then be the cousin of Jesus or a son of Joseph from a previous marriage. Another tradition holds that this is the Simeon of Jerusalem who served as the second bishop of Jerusalem from 62 to 107 CE after the execution of James the Just, although he was born in Galilee.

===Later tradition (apocrypha and medieval)===
The apicriphal second-century &quot;Epistle of the Apostles&quot; (&quot;Epistula Apostolorum&quot;), a polemic against gnostics, lists him among the apostles purported to be writing the letter (who include Thomas) as Judas Zelotes. Certain Old Latin translations of the Gospel of Matthew substitute &quot;Judas the Zealot&quot; for Thaddeus/Lebbaeus in Matthew 10:3. To some readers, this suggests that he may be identical with the &quot;Judas not Iscariot&quot; mentioned in John 14:22: &quot;Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Our Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?&quot; As it has been suggested that Jude is identical with the Apostle Thomas (see Jude Thomas), an identification of &quot;Simon Zelotes&quot; with Thomas is also possible. Barbara Thiering identified Simon Zelotes with Simon Magus; however, this view has received no serious acceptance. The New Testament records nothing more of Simon, aside from this multitude of possible but unlikely pseudonyms.

In the apocryphal Arabic Infancy Gospel a fact related to this apostle is mentioned. A boy named Simon is bitten by a snake in his hand; he is healed by Jesus, who told the child &quot;you shall be my disciple&quot;. The mention ends with the phrase &quot;this is Simon the Cananite, of whom mention is made in the Gospel.&quot;

Isidore of Seville drew together the accumulated anecdotes of Simon in &quot;De Vita et Morte&quot;.

According to the Golden Legend, which is a collection of hagiographies, compiled by Jacobus de Voragine in the thirteenth century, &quot;Simon the Cananaean and Judas Thaddeus were brethren of James the Less and sons of Mary Cleophas, who was married to Alpheus.&quot;

In later tradition, Simon is often associated with Jude the Apostle as an evangelizing team; in Western Christianity, they share their feast day on 28 October. The most widespread tradition is that after evangelizing in Egypt, Simon joined Jude in Persia and Armenia or Beirut in today&#x27;s Lebanon, where both were martyred in 65. This version is the one found in the Golden Legend. He may have suffered crucifixion as the Bishop of Jerusalem. According to an Eastern tradition, Simon travelled to Georgia on a missionary trip, died in Abkhazia and was buried in Nicopsia, a not yet identified site on the Black Sea coast. His remains were later transferred to Anakopia in today&#x27;s Abkhazia.
Another tradition states that he traveled in the Middle East and Africa. Christian Ethiopians claim that he was crucified in Samaria, while Justus Lipsius writes that he was sawn in half at Suanir, Persia. However, Moses of Chorene writes that he was martyred at Weriosphora in Caucasian Iberia. Tradition also claims he died peacefully at Edessa.

Yet another tradition says he visited Roman Britain. In this account, in his second mission to Britain, he arrived during the year 60, the first of Boadicea&#x27;s rebellion. He was crucified 10 May 61 by the Roman Catus Decianus, at Caistor, modern-day Lincolnshire in England. According to Caesar Baronius and Hippolytus of Rome, Simon&#x27;s first arrival in Britain was in the year 44, during the Roman conquest. Nikephoros I of Constantinople writes:

Another tradition, doubtless inspired by his title &quot;the Zealot&quot;, states that he was involved in the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 AD).

==Sainthood==
Simon, like the other Apostles, is regarded as a saint by the Catholic Church, including the Eastern Catholic Churches, as also by the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheran Church and the churches of the Anglican Communion. In the Church of England he is remembered (with Jude) with a Festival on 28 October.

==In Christian art==
In art, Simon has the identifying attribute of a saw because according to tradition he was martyred by being sawn in half.

===Gallery===
==In Islam==
In Islam, Muslim exegesis and Quran commentary name the twelve apostles and include Simon amongst the disciples. Muslim tradition says that Simon was sent to preach the faith of God to the Berbers, outside North Africa.

<text>Ramat HaSharon (, ) is an affluent city located on Israel&#x27;s central coastal strip in the south of the Sharon region, bordering the cities of Tel Aviv to the south, Hod-HaSharon to the east, and Herzliya and kibbutz Glil Yam to the north. It is part of the Tel Aviv District, within the Gush Dan metropolitan area. In Ramat HaSharon had a population of and its citizens are nearly entirely Jewish.

==History==

Ramat HaSharon, originally Ir Shalom (, City of Peace), was a moshava established in 1923 by olim from Poland. It was built on 2,000 dunams () of land purchased for 5 Egyptian pounds per dunam. In the 1931 census, the village-esque town had a population of 312.

In 1932, this Jewish community was renamed Kfar Ramat HaSharon ( The Highplain Village of the Sharon [region]). By 1950, the population was up to 900. Rapid population growth in the 1960s and 1970s led to construction of many new roadways, schools and parks. Several distinct neighborhoods evolved in the 1970s, including Morasha on the southern edge, one with many military and air force personnel in the eastern edge, and many successful professionals moved into the developing city. Ramat HaSharon became a highly desirable place to live in the 1980s as a very safe place, containing many gardens and wide boulevards, and attracting many upper middle class suburban families.

While qualifying for city status by number of residents (with more than 30 thousand residents) from the 1980s, Ramat HaSharon&#x27;s mayors preferred to maintain the local council designation and acted to maintain the character of the settlement by limiting development. Although, Ramat HaSharon was later granted city status in 2002.

=== Archaeology ===
In August 2021, Israeli archaeologists led by Yoav Arbel excavated a Byzantine and Early Islamic settlement at Khirbat el-‘Ora, prior to the establishment of a new neighborhood. The excavation revealed a wine press paved with a mosaic along with a coin minted by Emperor Heraclius. According to coin expert Robert Kool, one side of the gold depicted the emperor and his two sons, while the other side depicted the hill of Golgotha in Jerusalem. A Greek or Aramaic inscription was engraved on the surface of the coins, probably with the name of the coin owner. According to Yoel Arbel, stone mortars and millstones were used to grind barley and wheat and very likely also to crush herbs and healing plants.

==Geography==
The main portion of the city is located north of Highway 5, east of Highway 20 and Glil Yam, to the west of the Israel Military Industries factory and Highway 4, and to the south of Herzliya. The city&#x27;s administrative boundaries extend in an L-shaped fashion to the south of highway 5 and bordering with Tel Aviv reaching until Highway 2 in the west.

The Neve-Gan neighborhood is disconnected from the rest of the city and is located to the south of the main city, and is adjacent to Kiryat Shaul Cemetery Tel Aviv&#x27;s Tel Baruch. The Israel Tennis Centers is also south of route 5. The Cinema City Glilot commercial complex is similarly disconnected from the city and is located on the intersection of highway 5 and 2.

The majority of the population lives around the two main streets: &quot;Sokolov&quot; and &quot;Usishkin&quot;. in the west. The east in the &quot;Morasha&quot; neighborhood, has no major commercial area, important locations or even a high school. Morasha has long been neglected because of political reasons, though the population hopes they will get more support after a small increase in later years

==Economy==

Until the 1960s, it was primarily a farming community, known for its strawberry fields and citrus groves. Ramat HaSharon is also home to Israel Military Industries, the manufacturer of weapons and small arms for the Israel Defense Forces and the world market.

== Education ==
Ramat Hasharon has seven elementary schools, two middle schools (Alumim, and Kelman), and two high schools (Rothberg, and Alon). Midrasha LoOmanut, an art teachers training college, and Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music are located in the city. The Geology Museum is located in a Bauhaus style building built in 1945.

==Sports==
Ramat HaSharon is home to the Israel Tennis Center, founded in 1975, which hosts and organizes international, national and regional tennis tournaments. The courts are also widely used during the Maccabiah Games. The ATP World Tour, which had been in Israel from 1987 to 1996, was scheduled to return to the Israel Tennis Center in September 2014 with the Negev Israel Open, but the event was cancelled because of the military conflict in the region. Along with tennis facilities, which include 24 illuminated courts, and stands which seat up to 4,500 spectators, the central management of the organization, which manages 13 other tennis centers around the country, is located in the town. It also is home to Canada Stadium, where most Davis Cup and other significant Israeli tennis matches have been played since the mid-1970s.

Herbalife Ramat HaSharon is the city&#x27;s women basketball team, one of the leading teams in the Israeli league and a former European champion. The city&#x27;s football team, Hapoel Ramat HaSharon, plays in Ligat Ha&#x27;al, the premiere league of Israeli football. Alumim, one of the city&#x27;s junior high schools, has won many trophies in sports, especially for achievements in track and field.

<text>In differential geometry, a one-form (or covector field) on a differentiable manifold is a differential form of degree one, that is, a smooth section of the cotangent bundle. Equivalently, a one-form on a manifold formula_1 is a smooth mapping of the total space of the tangent bundle of formula_1 to formula_3 whose restriction to each fibre is a linear functional on the tangent space. Let formula_4 be a one-form. Then
formula_5

Often one-forms are described locally, particularly in local coordinates. In a local coordinate system, a one-form is a linear combination of the differentials of the coordinates:
formula_6
where the formula_7 are smooth functions. From this perspective, a one-form has a covariant transformation law on passing from one coordinate system to another. Thus a one-form is an order 1 covariant tensor field.

==Examples==

The most basic non-trivial differential one-form is the &quot;change in angle&quot; form formula_8 This is defined as the derivative of the angle &quot;function&quot; formula_9 (which is only defined up to an additive constant), which can be explicitly defined in terms of the atan2 function. Taking the derivative yields the following formula for the total derivative:
formula_10
While the angle &quot;function&quot; cannot be continuously defined – the function atan2 is discontinuous along the negative formula_11-axis – which reflects the fact that angle cannot be continuously defined, this derivative is continuously defined except at the origin, reflecting the fact that infinitesimal (and indeed local) in angle can be defined everywhere except the origin. Integrating this derivative along a path gives the total change in angle over the path, and integrating over a closed loop gives the winding number times formula_12

In the language of differential geometry, this derivative is a one-form on the punctured plane. It is closed (its exterior derivative is zero) but not exact, meaning that it is not the derivative of a 0-form (that is, a function): the angle formula_13 is not a globally defined smooth function on the entire punctured plane. In fact, this form generates the first de Rham cohomology of the punctured plane. This is the most basic example of such a form, and it is fundamental in differential geometry.

==Differential of a function==
Let formula_14 be open (for example, an interval formula_15), and consider a differentiable function formula_16 with derivative formula_17 The differential formula_18 assigns to each point formula_19 a linear map from the tangent space formula_20 to the real numbers. In this case, each tangent space is naturally identifiable with the real number line, and the linear map formula_21 in question is given by scaling by formula_22 This is the simplest example of a differential (one-)form.

<doc id="314693" wikidata="Q1490788" url="?curid=314693" title="Jadis (band)">
<text>Jadis are a British neo-prog group. They play guitar-driven rock with the use of synthesisers to add depth and atmosphere, and an emphasis on melody. They were previously signed to InsideOut Music.

The name Jadis is taken from the novel &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; by C. S. Lewis. The same character appears as the white witch in &quot;The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;

==History==
Jadis were formed in 1982 and in 1987 self-released the cassette &quot;Jadis&quot;, which was produced by Marillion&#x27;s Steve Rothery. In 1992, &quot;More Than Meets the Eye&quot; was released and was received well in the progressive rock scene.

Jadis are led by Gary Chandler (vocals, electric guitar), although generally the whole group are given songwriting credit. Other original members of the band were Trevor Dawkins (bass), Pete Salmon (keyboards) and Paul Alwin (drums), who was replaced by Mark Law in July 1988. Later members were Martin Orford (keyboards), John Jowitt (bass) and Steve Christey (drums). Orford and Jowitt were also members of IQ during that time.

In the late 1990s, Orford and Jowitt left the band for a while and were replaced by Mike Torr (keyboards) and Steve Hunt (bass), but they returned for 2000&#x27;s &quot;Understand&quot;. After completing their album &quot;Photoplay&quot; in 2006, Orford left the band for a second time because he retired from the music industry. He was replaced with Italian session pianist/keyboardist Giulio Risi but has since rejoined. The same year, Jowitt also left the band again, and was replaced with session player Andy Marlow. The band released the album &quot;See Right Through You&quot; in 2012, followed by &quot;No Fear of Looking Down&quot; in 2016. After two compilations the album &quot;More Questions Than Anwers&quot; was released in 2024.

The band are based in Southampton.

<doc id="314696" wikidata="Q932068" url="?curid=314696" title="Environmental health">
<text>Environmental health is the branch of public health concerned with all aspects of the natural and built environment affecting human health. To effectively control factors that may affect health, the requirements that must be met to create a healthy environment must be determined. The major sub-disciplines of environmental health are environmental science, toxicology, environmental epidemiology, and environmental and occupational medicine.

== Definitions ==
=== WHO definitions ===
Environmental health was defined in a 1989 document by the World Health Organization (WHO) as:
Those aspects of human health and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It is also referred to as the theory and practice of accessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially affect health.

A 1990 WHO document states that environmental health, as used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, &quot;includes both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation and some biological agents, and the effects (often indirect) on health and well being of the broad physical, psychological, social and cultural environment, which includes housing, urban development, land use and transport.&quot;

, the WHO website on environmental health states that &quot;Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviours. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. This definition excludes behaviour not related to environment, as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment, as well as genetics.&quot;

The WHO has also defined environmental health services as &quot;those services which implement environmental health policies through monitoring and control activities. They also carry out that role by promoting the improvement of environmental parameters and by encouraging the use of environmentally friendly and healthy technologies and behaviors. They also have a leading role in developing and suggesting new policy areas.&quot;

=== Other considerations ===
The term environmental medicine may be seen as a medical specialty, or branch of the broader field of environmental health. Terminology is not fully established, and in many European countries they are used interchangeably.

Other terms referring to or concerning environmental health include environmental public health and health protection.

===Pediatric environmental health===
Children&#x27;s environmental health is the academic discipline that studies how environmental exposures in early life—chemical, biological, nutritional, and social—influence health and development in childhood and across the entire human life span. Pediatric environmental health is based on the recognition that children are not “little adults.” Infants and children have unique patterns of exposure and vulnerabilities. Environmental risks of infants and children are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those of adults. Pediatric environmental health is highly interdisciplinary. It spans and brings together general pediatrics and numerous pediatric subspecialties as well as epidemiology, occupational and environmental medicine, medical toxicology, industrial hygiene, and exposure science.

== Disciplines ==

Five basic disciplines generally contribute to the field of environmental health: environmental epidemiology, toxicology, exposure science, environmental engineering, and environmental law. Each of these five disciplines contributes different information to describe problems and solutions in environmental health. However, there is some overlap among them.
* Environmental epidemiology studies the relationship between environmental exposures (including exposure to chemicals, radiation, microbiological agents, etc.) and human health. Observational studies, which simply observe exposures that people have already experienced, are common in environmental epidemiology because humans cannot ethically be exposed to agents that are known or suspected to cause disease. While the inability to use experimental study designs is a limitation of environmental epidemiology, this discipline directly observes effects on human health rather than estimating effects from animal studies. &quot;Environmental epidemiology&quot; is the study of the effect on human health of physical, biologic, and chemical factors in the external environment, broadly conceived. Also, examining specific populations or communities exposed to different ambient environments, Epidemiology in our environment aims to clarify the relationship that exist between physical, biologic or chemical factors and human health.
* Toxicology studies how environmental exposures lead to specific health outcomes, generally in animals, as a means to understand possible health outcomes in humans. Toxicology has the advantage of being able to conduct randomized controlled trials and other experimental studies because they can use animal subjects. However, there are many differences in animal and human biology, and there can be a lot of uncertainty when interpreting the results of animal studies for their implications for human health.
* Exposure science studies human exposure to environmental contaminants by both identifying and quantifying exposures. Exposure science can be used to support environmental epidemiology by better describing environmental exposures that may lead to a particular health outcome, identify common exposures whose health outcomes may be better understood through a toxicology study, or can be used in a risk assessment to determine whether current levels of exposure might exceed recommended levels. Exposure science has the advantage of being able to very accurately quantify exposures to specific chemicals, but it does not generate any information about health outcomes like environmental epidemiology or toxicology.
* Environmental engineering applies scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments from potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and general improvement of environmental quality.
* Environmental law includes the network of treaties, statutes, regulations, common and customary laws addressing the effects of human activity on the natural environment.

Information from epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science can be combined to conduct a risk assessment for specific chemicals, mixtures of chemicals or other risk factors to determine whether an exposure poses significant risk to human health (exposure would likely result in the development of pollution-related diseases). This can in turn be used to develop and implement environmental health policy that, for example, regulates chemical emissions, or imposes standards for proper sanitation. Actions of engineering and law can be combined to provide risk management to minimize, monitor, and otherwise manage the impact of exposure to protect human health to achieve the objectives of environmental health policy.

== Concerns ==

Environmental health addresses all human-health-related aspects of the natural environment and the built environment. Environmental health concerns include:
* Biosafety.
* Disaster preparedness and response.
* Food safety, including in agriculture, transportation, food processing, wholesale and retail distribution and sale.
* Housing, including substandard housing abatement and the inspection of jails and prisons.
* Childhood lead poisoning prevention.
* Land use planning, including smart growth.
* Liquid waste disposal, including city waste water treatment plants and on-site waste water disposal systems, such as septic tank systems and chemical toilets.
* Medical waste management and disposal.
* Occupational health and industrial hygiene.
* Radiological health, including exposure to ionizing radiation from X-rays or radioactive isotopes.
* Recreational water illness prevention, including from swimming pools, spas and ocean and freshwater bathing places.
* Solid waste management, including landfills, recycling facilities, composting and solid waste transfer stations.
* Toxic chemical exposure whether in consumer products, housing, workplaces, air, water or soil.
* Toxins from molds and algal blooms.
* Vector control, including the control of mosquitoes, rodents, flies, cockroaches and other animals that may transmit pathogens.

According to recent estimates, about 5 to 10% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost are due to environmental causes in Europe. By far the most important factor is fine particulate matter pollution in urban air. Similarly, environmental exposures have been estimated to contribute to 4.9 million (8.7%) deaths and 86 million (5.7%) DALYs globally. In the United States, Superfund sites created by various companies have been found to be hazardous to human and environmental health in nearby communities. It was this perceived threat, raising the specter of miscarriages, mutations, birth defects, and cancers that most frightened the public.

=== Air quality ===
Air quality includes ambient outdoor air quality and indoor air quality. Large concerns about air quality include environmental tobacco smoke, air pollution by forms of chemical waste, and other concerns.

==== Outdoor air quality ====
Air pollution is globally responsible for over 6.5 million deaths each year. Air pollution is the contamination of an atmosphere due to the presence of substances that are harmful to the health of living organisms, the environment or climate. These substances concern environmental health officials since air pollution is often a risk-factor for diseases that are related to pollution, like lung cancer, respiratory infections, asthma, heart disease, and other forms of respiratory-related illnesses. Reducing air pollution, and thus developing air quality, has been found to decrease adult mortality.

Common products responsible for emissions include road traffic, energy production, household combustion, aviation and motor vehicles, and other forms of pollutants. These pollutants are responsible for the burning of fuel, which can release harmful particles into the air that humans and other living organisms can inhale or ingest.

Air pollution is associated with adverse health effects like respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, related illnesses, and even death. The risk of air pollution is determined by the pollutant&#x27;s hazard and the amount of exposure that affects a person. For example, a child who plays outdoor sports will have a higher likelihood of outdoor air pollution exposure than an adult who tends to spend more time indoors, whether at work or elsewhere. Environmental health officials work to detect individuals who are at higher risks of consuming air pollution, work to decrease their exposure, and detect risk factors present in communities.

However, as shown in research by Ernesto, Sánchez-Triana in the case of Pakistan. After identifying the main sources of air pollution, such as mobile sources, such as heavy-duty vehicles and motorized 2–3 wheelers; stationary sources, such as power plants and burning of waste; and natural dust. The country implemented a clean air policy to reduce the road transport sector, which is responsible for 85% of particulate matter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) total emissions and 72% of particulate matter of less than 10 microns (PM10) Most successful policies were:
* Improving fuel quality by reducing the sulfur content in diesel
* Converting diesel minibuses and city delivery vans to compressed natural gas (CNG)
* Installing diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) on existing large buses and trucks
* Converting existing two-stroke rickshaws to four-stroke CNG engines
* Introducing low-sulfur fuel oil (1% sulfur) to major users located in Karachi

==== Indoor air quality ====
Household air pollution contributes to diseases that kill almost 4.3 million people every year. Indoor air pollution contributes to risk factors for diseases like heart disease, pulmonary disease, stroke, pneumonia, and other associated illnesses. For vulnerable populations, such as children and elderly populations, who spend large amounts of their time indoors or indoor air quality can be dangerous.

Burning fuels like coal or kerosene inside homes can cause dangerous chemicals to be released into the air. Dampness and mold in houses can cause diseases, but few studies have been performed on mold in schools and workplaces. Environmental tobacco smoke is considered to be a leading contributor to indoor air pollution since exposure to second and third-hand smoke is a common risk factor. Tobacco smoke contains over 60 carcinogens, where 18% are known human carcinogens. Exposure to these chemicals can lead to exacerbation of asthma, the development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiopulmonary diseases, and an increase in the likelihood of cancer development.

=== Climate change and its effects on health ===
Climate change makes extreme weather events more likely, including ozone smog events, dust storms, and elevated aerosol levels, all due to extreme heat, drought, winds, and rainfall. These extreme weather events can increase the likelihood of undernutrition, mortality, food insecurity, and climate-sensitive infectious diseases in vulnerable populations. The effects of climate change are felt by the whole world, but disproportionately affect disadvantaged populations who are subject to climate change vulnerability.

Climate impacts can affect exposure to water-borne pathogens through increased rates of runoff, frequent heavy rains, and the effects of severe storms. Extreme weather events and storm surges can also exceed the capacity of water infrastructure, which can increase the likelihood that populations will be exposed to these contaminants. Exposure to these contaminants are more likely in low-income communities, where they have inadequate infrastructure to respond to climate disasters and are less likely to recover from infrastructure damage as quickly.

Problems like the loss of homes, loved ones, and previous ways of life, are often what people face after a climate disaster occurs. These events can lead to vulnerability in the form of housing affordability stress, lower household income, lack of community attachment, grief, and anxiety around another disaster occurring.

=== Environmental racism ===

Certain groups of people can be put at a higher risk for environmental hazards like air, soil and water pollution. This often happens due to marginalization, economic and political processes, and racism. Environmental racism uniquely affects different groups globally, however generally the most marginalized groups of any region are affected. These marginalized groups are frequently put next to pollution sources like major roadways, toxic waste sites, landfills, and chemical plants. In a 2021 study, it was found that racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States are exposed to disproportionately high levels of particulate air pollution. Racial housing policies that exist in the United States continue to exacerbate racial minority exposure to air pollution at a disproportionate rate, even as overall pollution levels have declined. Likewise, in a 2022 study, it was shown that implementing policy changes that favor wealth redistribution could double as climate change mitigation measures. For populations who are not subject to wealth redistribution measures, this means more money will flow into their communities while climate effects are mitigated.

=== Noise pollution ===

Noise pollution is usually environmental, machine-created sound that can disrupt activities or communication between humans and other forms of life. Exposure to persistent noise pollution can cause numerous ailments like hearing impairment, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular problems, annoyance, problems with communication and other diseases. For American minorities that live in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status, they often experience higher levels of noise pollution compared to their higher socioeconomic counterparts.

Noise pollution can cause or exacerbate cardiovascular diseases, which can further attribute to a larger range of diseases, increase stress levels, and cause sleep disturbances. Noise pollution is also responsible for many reported cases of hearing loss, tinnitus, and other forms of hypersensitivity(stress/irritability) or lack thereof to sound(present or subconscious from continuous exposure). These conditions can be dangerous to children and young adults who consistently experience noise pollution, as many of these conditions can develop into long-term problems, including physical and mental health issues.

Children who attend school in noisy traffic zones have shown to have 15% lower memory development compared to other students who attended schools in quiet traffic zones, according to a Barcelona study. This is consistent with research that suggests that children who are exposed to regular aircraft noise &quot;have inadequate performance on standardised achievement tests.&quot;

Exposure to persistent noise pollution can cause one to develop hearing impairments, like tinnitus or impaired speech discrimination. One of the largest factors in worsened mental health due to noise pollution is annoyance. Annoyance due to environmental factors has been found to increase stress reactions and overall feelings of stress among adults. The level of annoyance felt by an individual varies, but contributes to worsened mental health significantly.

Noise exposure also contributes to sleep disturbances, which can cause daytime sleepiness and an overall lack of sleep, which contributes to worsened health. Daytime sleepiness has been linked to several reports of declining mental health and other health issues, job insecurities and further social and environmental factors declining.

=== Safe drinking water ===

Access to safe drinking water is considered a &quot;basic human need for health and well-being&quot; by the United Nations. According to their reports, over 2 billion people worldwide live without access to safe drinking water. In 2017, almost 22 million Americans drank from water systems that were in violation of public health standards. Globally, over 2 billion people drink feces-contaminated water, which poses the greatest threat to drinking water safety. Contaminated drinking water could transmit diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid, diarrhea and polio.

Harmful chemicals in drinking water can negatively affect health. Unsafe water management practices can increase the prevalence of water-borne diseases and sanitation-related illnesses. Inadequate disinfecting of wastewater in industrial and agricultural centers can also infect hundreds of millions of people with contaminated water. Chemicals like fluoride and arsenic can benefit humans when the levels of these chemicals are controlled;but other, more dangerous chemicals like lead and metals can be harmful to humans.

In America, communities of color can be subject to poor-quality water. In communities in America with large Hispanic and black populations, there is a correlated rise in SDWA health violations. Populations who have experienced lack of safe drinking water, like populations in Flint, Michigan, are more likely to distrust tap water in their communities. Populations to experience this are commonly low-income, communities of color.

=== Hazardous materials management ===
Hazardous materials management, including hazardous waste management, contaminated site remediation, the prevention of leaks from underground storage tanks and the prevention of hazardous materials releases to the environment and responses to emergency situations resulting from such releases. When hazardous materials are not managed properly, waste can pollute nearby water sources and reduce air quality.

According to a study done in Austria, people who live near industrial sites are &quot;more often unemployed, have lower educations levels, and are twice as likely to be immigrants. With the interest of environmental health in mind, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was passed in the United States in 1976 that covered how to properly manage hazardous waste.

There are a variety of occupations that work with hazardous materials and help manage them so that everything is disposed of correctly. These professionals work in various sectors, including government agencies, private industry, consulting firms, and non-profit organizations, all with the common goal of ensuring the safe handling of hazardous materials and waste. These positions include but are not limited to Environmental Health and Safety Specialists, Waste collectors, Medical Professionals, and Emergency Responders. Handling waste, especially hazardous materials is considered one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. Often, these workers may not have all of information about the specific hazardous materials they encounter, making their jobs even more dangerous. The sudden exposure to materials they are not properly prepared to handle can lead to severe consequences. This emphasizes the importance of training, safety protocols, and the use of personal protective equipment for those working with hazardous waste.

== Information and mapping ==

The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) is a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site, that includes open access to resources produced by US government agencies and organizations, and is maintained under the umbrella of the Specialized Information Service at the United States National Library of Medicine. TEHIP includes links to technical databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and consumer-oriented resources. TEHIP is responsible for the Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET), an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases including the Hazardous Substances Data Bank, that are open access, i.e. available free of charge. TOXNET was retired in 2019.

There are many environmental health mapping tools. TOXMAP is a geographic information system (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory and Superfund Basic Research Programs. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US federal government. TOXMAP&#x27;s chemical and environmental health information is taken from the NLM&#x27;s Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) and PubMed, and from other authoritative sources.

== Environmental health profession ==
Environmental health professionals may be known as environmental health officers, public health inspectors, environmental health specialists or environmental health practitioners. Researchers and policy-makers also play important roles in how environmental health is practiced in the field. In many European countries, physicians and veterinarians are involved in environmental health. In the United Kingdom, practitioners must have a graduate degree in environmental health and be certified and registered with the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health or the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland. In Canada, practitioners in environmental health are required to obtain an approved bachelor&#x27;s degree in environmental health along with the national professional certificate, the Certificate in Public Health Inspection (Canada), CPHI(C). Many states in the United States also require that individuals have a bachelor&#x27;s degree and professional licenses to practice environmental health. California state law defines the scope of practice of environmental health as follows:

:&quot;Scope of practice in environmental health&quot; means the practice of environmental health by registered environmental health specialists in the public and private sector within the meaning of this article and includes, but is not limited to, organization, management, education, enforcement, consultation, and emergency response for the purpose of prevention of environmental health hazards and the promotion and protection of the public health and the environment in the following areas: food protection; housing; institutional environmental health; land use; community noise control; recreational swimming areas and waters; electromagnetic radiation control; solid, liquid, and hazardous materials management; underground storage tank control; onsite septic systems; vector control; drinking water quality; water sanitation; emergency preparedness; and milk and dairy sanitation pursuant to Section 33113 of the Food and Agricultural Code.

The environmental health profession had its modern-day roots in the sanitary and public health movement of the United Kingdom. This was epitomized by Sir Edwin Chadwick, who was instrumental in the repeal of the poor laws, and in 1884 was the founding president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now called the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health.

<text>Longreach is a rural town and locality in the Longreach Region, Queensland, Australia. It is the administrative centre of the Longreach Regional Council, which was established in 2008 as a merger of the former Longreach, Ilfracombe, and Isisford shires. Longreach is a well known tourist destination due to its aviation history and importance. In the , the locality of Longreach had a population of 3,124.

== Geography ==
Longreach is in Central West Queensland, approximately from the coast, west of Rockhampton. The town is on the Tropic of Capricorn in the south-east of the locality. The town is named after the ‘long reach’ of the Thomson River on which it is situated.

Lochern National Park is in the south-western part of the locality (formerly in Vergemont).

The main industries of the area are cattle, sheep, and, more recently, tourism.

The Landsborough Highway enters the locality from the south-east (Ilfracombe), passes through the town and then exits to the north-west (Corfield). The Central Western railway line takes the same route, the town being served by the Longreach railway station. The Thomson Developmental Road commences at the town and passes through the south-east of the locality (briefly passing through the westernmost part of Ilfracombe) before exiting to the south (Stonehenge).

In Longreach, the streets are named after species of birds, with the streets running east–west named after water birds and those running north–south after land birds. The main business street is called Eagle Street. Other streets honour Hudson Fysh, an Australian aviation pioneer, and Sir James Walker, a farmer and long-serving mayor of the former Longreach Shire Council.

== History ==
Longreach lies within the traditional tribal lands of the Iningai people. Iningai (also known as Yiningay, Muttaburra, Tateburra, Yinangay, Yinangi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Iningai people. The Iningai language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Longreach Region, particularly the towns of Longreach, Barcaldine, Muttaburra and Aramac as well as the properties of Bowen Downs and catchments of Cornish Creek and Alice River.

Kuungkari (also known as Kungkari and Koonkerri) is a language of Western Queensland. The Kuungkari language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Longreach Shire Council and Blackall-Tambo Shire Council.

The first Europeans to enter the area were part of the expedition led by William Landsborough in 1862. This party initially tried to intimidate the resident Iningai by galloping their horses at them and shooting over their heads. However, they found the Iningai were a bold, powerfully built people who did not run away. Through an Aboriginal Native Police trooper named Jemmy who accompanied Landsborough and spoke the Iningai language, they were able to communicate with the Iningai and were told the geography of the region and shown the best roads to travel by. An Iningai man named Wittin acted as their guide.

In 1862, the enormous Bowen Downs cattle station was established across the region by William Landsborough, Nathaniel Buchanan and Edward Cornish, with the financial backing of Robert Morehead and Matthew Young of the Scottish Australian Investment Company. In 1872, Bowen Downs was divided into two huge properties, the section along the Thomson River being named Mount Cornish, managed by Edward R. Edkins. An outstation of this Mount Cornish cattle station was called Longreach, because it was situated on a long reach of the Thomson River. This location later developed into the township of Longreach. 

The town of Longreach was gazetted in 1887, and its post office opened on 1 October 1891. The Central Western railway line reached the town on 15 February 1892, causing the population to grow. Longreach State School opened on 22 May 1893 with an enrolment of 102 students, and the Presentation Sisters founded a primary school in 1900 that became Our Ladies&#x27; College. In 1920 Qantas was formed making a big start to the little town. St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School was established in 1925. In 1935 Our Ladies&#x27; College expanded to offer secondary education to Year 10, becoming the first secondary school in Central Western Queensland.

Cominos Brothers opened a cafe in Eagle Street, the town’s main street in 1911. The cafe was known as Comino Bros. Central Café and American Bar, probably because it had an American-style soda fountain.

Longreach Rail Post Office opened by April 1940 and closed in 1962.

Longreach State High School opened on 24 January 1966.

Evesham State School opened in the former Morella on 23 January 1967. It was mothballed on 31 December 2009 and then permanently closed on 31 December 2010.

In 1970, Queen Elizabeth II, The Duke of Edinburgh and Her Royal Highness Princess Anne toured Australia including Queensland. The Queensland tour began on Sunday 12 April when the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; entered Moreton Bay at Caloundra, sailing into Newstead Wharf. After several days of engagements in the city of Brisbane, Queen Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh commenced their regional tour flying to Longreach on Wednesday 15 April. The primary purpose for their stopover in Longreach was to visit the first operational base of Queensland’s first airline, Qantas, which became Australia’s Overseas Airline. During the visit they viewed an exhibition of Qantas memorabilia, including a replica of the company’s first aircraft, the AVRO 504K of 1921. The occasion marked the 50th anniversary of the founding of The Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, Limited (Qantas). Qantas Airways celebrated its centenary in 2020.

On 1 January 1986, Our Ladies&#x27; College relocated to the St Joseph&#x27;s site. A pre-school was added in 1992. It returned to being only a primary school (P-6) at the end of 1994. In 2002, the school changed its name to Our Ladies&#x27; School.

Longreach School of Distance Education (also known as Longreach School of the Air) opened on 27 January 1987.

In early April 2010, Longreach experienced a significant locust plague described by local residents as the worst in three decades.

In January 2019, it was decided to reduce the number of localities within Longreach Region by amalgamating the localities to the north and west of the town of Longreach into the locality of Longreach. The localities amalgamated were: Camoola, Chorregon, Ernestina, Maneroo, Morella, Tocal, and Vergemont. As a consequence of this amalgamation, the Longreach Region has only three localities: Longreach, Ilfracombe and Isisford.

On 17 August 2024, the purchase of this land to turn into a national park, Queensland&#x27;s environment minister, Leanne Linard, assured the industry that small-scale opal mining would still be permitted in suitable areas, aiming for a balance between conservation and mining. However, many in the industry, including Erik Madsen, founder of the Australian Opal Centre, remain sceptical. Madsen emphasized that opal is Australia&#x27;s national gemstone, making this issue one of national significance. On that date, the miners have been mandated to retrieve licenses and permits to continue their work.

<text>Ferdinand Tönnies (; 26 July 1855 – 9 April 1936) was a German sociologist, economist, and philosopher. He was a significant contributor to sociological theory and field studies, best known for distinguishing between two types of social groups, Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (&quot;community and society&quot;). He co-founded the German Sociological Association together with Max Weber and Georg Simmel and many other founders. He was president of the society from 1909 to 1933, after which he was ousted for having criticized the Nazis. Tönnies was regarded as the first proper German sociologist and published over 900 works, contributing to many areas of sociology and philosophy. Tönnies, Max Weber, and Georg Simmel are considered the founding fathers of classical German sociology. Though there has been a resurgence of interest in Weber and Simmel, Tönnies has not drawn as much attention.

Ferdinand Tönnies was born on 26 July 1855 on the Haubarg &quot;De Reap&quot;, Oldenswort on the Eiderstedt Peninsula into a wealthy farmer&#x27;s family in North Frisia, Duchy of Schleswig, then under Danish rule. Tönnies was the only sociologist of his generation who came from the countryside. He was the third child of church chief and farmer August Ferdinand Tönnies (1822–1883), and his wife Ida Frederica (born Mau, 1826–1915), came from a theological family from East Holstein. His father, of Frisian ancestry, was a successful farmer and cattle rancher, while his mother hailed from a line of Lutheran ministers. The two had seven children, four sons and three daughters. On the day he was born, Ferdinand Tönnies received the baptismal name of Ferdinand Julius and moved to Husum, on the North Sea, after his father retired in 1864.

=== Education and academic career ===
Tönnies enrolled at the University of Strasbourg after graduating from high school in 1872. He took the time to utilize his freedom to travel, exploring the academic fields of the Universities of Jena, Bonn, Leipzig, Berlin, and Tübingen. At age 22, he received a doctorate in philology at the University of Tübingen in 1877 (with a Latin thesis on the ancient Siwa Oasis). However, by this time, his main interests had switched to political philosophy and social issues. After completing postdoctoral work at the University of Berlin, he traveled to London to continue his studies on the seventeenth-century English political thinker Thomas Hobbes. Tönnies earned a Privatdozent in philosophy at the University of Kiel from 1909 to 1933 after submitting a draft of his major book, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, as his Habilitationsschrift in 1881. He held this post at the University of Kiel for only three years. Because he sympathized with the Hamburg dockers&#x27; strike of 1896, the conservative Prussian government considered him to be a social democrat, and Tönnies would not be called to a professorial chair until 1913. He returned to Kiel as a professor emeritus in 1921 where he took on a teaching position in sociology and taught until 1933 when he was ousted by the Nazis, due to earlier publications in which he had criticized them and had endorsed the Social Democratic Party. Remaining in Kiel, he died three years later in isolation in his home in 1936.

=== Sociological contributions ===
Many of his writings on sociological theories furthered pure sociology, including &quot;and&quot; (1887). He coined the metaphysical term &quot;Voluntarism&quot;. Tönnies also contributed to the study of social change, particularly on public opinion, customs and technology, crime, and suicide. He also had a vivid interest in methodology, especially statistics, and sociological research, inventing his own technique of statistical association. After publishing &quot;and&quot; , Tönnies focused aspects of the social life such as morals, folkways, and public opinion. However he is best known for his published work on and because his later works applied those concepts to aspects of social life.

==&quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; and &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;==
Tönnies distinguished between two types of social groupings. &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot;—often translated as &quot;community&quot; (or left untranslated)—refers to groups based on feelings of togetherness and mutual bonds, which are felt like a goal to be kept up, their members being means for this goal. &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;—often translated as &quot;society&quot;—on the other hand, refers to groups that are sustained by it being instrumental for their members&#x27; aims and goals. The equilibrium in &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; is achieved through means of social control, such as morals, conformism, and exclusion, while &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; keeps its balance through police, laws, tribunals, and prisons. Amish and Hasidic communities are examples of &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot;, while states are types of &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;. Rules in &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; are implicit, while &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; has explicit rules (written laws).

&quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; may be exemplified historically by a family or a neighborhood in a pre-modern (rural) society; &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; by a joint-stock company or a state in a modern society, i.e. the society when Tönnies lived. &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; relationships arose in an urban and capitalist setting, characterized by individualism and impersonal monetary connections between people. Social ties were often instrumental and superficial, with self-interest and exploitation increasingly the norm. Examples are corporations, states, or voluntary associations. In his book &quot;Einteilung der Soziologie&quot; (Classification of Sociology) he distinguished between three disciplines of sociology, being Pure or Theoretical (&quot;reine, theoretische&quot;) Sociology, Applied (&quot;angewandte&quot;) Sociology, and Empirical (&quot;emprische&quot;) Sociology.

His distinction between social groupings is based on the assumption that there are only two primary forms of an actor&#x27;s will to approve of other men. For Tönnies, such approval is by no means self-evident; he is pretty influenced by Thomas Hobbes. Following his &quot;essential will&quot; (&quot;Wesenwille&quot;), an actor will see himself as a means to serve the goals of social grouping; very often, it is an underlying, subconscious force. Groupings formed around an essential will are called a Gemeinschaft. The other will is the &quot;arbitrary will&quot; (&quot;Kürwille&quot;): An actor sees a social grouping as a means to further his individual goals, so it is purposive and future-oriented. Groupings around the latter are called Gesellschaft. Whereas the membership in a Gemeinschaft is self-fulfilling, a Gesellschaft is instrumental for its members. In pure sociology—theoretically—these two standard types of will are to be strictly separated; in applied sociology—empirically—they are always mixed.

Gender Polarity in &quot;Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft&quot;

What is less well-known when discussing the work of Tönnies is that he frequently uses gender concepts to explain his main ideas. Essential will-arbitrary will, Gemeinschaft-Gesellschaft, are all thought of in terms of the polarity of feminine-masculine. Gemeinschaft, for example, is feminine: &quot;the eternal-feminine,&quot; since motherliness is the basis of all being together. Essential will is also feminine, whereas Gesellschaft and arbitrary choice are masculine. Tönnies&#x27; theory appears to consign him to a nineteenth-century view of the public world belonging to males, while women are relegated to the private realm, as it links together Gemeinschaft/home/woman as opposed to Gesellschaft/marketplace/man.

Views on Family

In his article &quot;&quot;Funfzehn Thesen zur Erneuerung eines Familienlebens&quot;,&quot; published in 1893, he claims that the dissolution of family life has tainted modern society&#x27;s blood. Tonnies believed that one of the most important ways to resurrect Gemeinschaft in the modern world would be to improve and prolong family life.

The demise of the family is caused by modern capitalism and its consequences: low pay, excessive hours of labor for men and women alike, and terrible living conditions. He believes family life has to be revitalized since it is the foundation of all culture and morals. In this case, he proposed two solutions that revolved around the idea of unions devoted to aid and nurture, as he would claim, &quot;the family spirit.&quot;

Two Solutions

# The first would be groupings of organically linked families who, in order to strengthen family life, would preserve family documents, correspond regularly, gather at family festivals, and assist one another by pooling resources. A family fund would be set up to help those who had fallen on hard times or who required money to develop unique skills. 
# The second version would bring together unrelated families and be dedicated to a simpler and healthier way of life, a more serious and reasonable method of social interaction, and a better comprehension of masculine and feminine thought. Three to five families would choose to band together to achieve these goals; eventually, they might live together in a common residence, engage in cooperative purchasing, and even share products. Groups may eventually band together in order to gain greater economic and moral power.

== Criticisms ==
Tönnies&#x27; distinction between &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; and &quot;Gesellschaft&quot;, like others between tradition and modernity, has been criticized for over-generalizing differences between societies and implying that all societies were following a similar evolutionary path, an argument which Tönnies himself never actually proclaimed.

== Legacy ==

The impact that Ferdinand Tönnies left on sociology was the division of groups unconsciously and consciously. His contribution to sociology included fundamental dichotomy, community and society—where structural forms are being made through social life. He separates the idea that individual consciousness vs community consciousness by indicating that community is built through beliefs and society is built through power and a separation of classes.

<text>Erectile tissue is tissue in the body with numerous vascular spaces, or cavernous tissue, that may become engorged with blood. However, tissue that is devoid of or otherwise lacking erectile tissue (such as the labia minora, vestibule, vagina and urethra) may also be described as engorging with blood, often with regard to sexual arousal.

==In sex organs==

Erectile tissue exists in external genitals such as the corpora cavernosa of the penis and their homologs in the clitoris, also called the corpora cavernosa. During penile or clitoral erection, the corpora cavernosa will become engorged with arterial blood, a process called &quot;tumescence&quot;. This may result from any of various physiological stimuli which can be internal or external. This process of stimulation, due to internal or external stimuli, is also known as sexual arousal. The corpus spongiosum is a single tubular structure located just below the corpora cavernosa in males. This may also become slightly engorged with blood, but less so than the corpora cavernosa.

==In the nose==

Erectile tissue is present in the anterior part of the nasal septum and is attached to the turbinates of the nose. The nasal cycle occurs as the erectile tissue on one side of the nose congests and the other side decongests. This process is controlled by the autonomic nervous system with parasympathetic dominance being associated with congestion and sympathetic with decongestion. The time of one cycle may vary greatly between individuals, with Kahana-Zweig et al. finding a range between 15 minutes and 10.35 hours though the average was noted as 2.15 ± 1.84 hours.

==Other types==
Erectile tissue is also found in the urethral sponge and perineal sponge. The erection of nipples is not due to erectile tissue, but rather due to the contraction of smooth muscle under the control of the autonomic nervous system.

<doc id="314708" wikidata="Q789195" url="?curid=314708" title="Autosuggestion">
<text>Autosuggestion is a psychological technique related to the placebo effect, developed by pharmacist Émile Coué at the beginning of the 20th century. It is a form of self-induced suggestion in which individuals guide their own thoughts, feelings, or behavior. The technique is often used in self-hypnosis.

==Typological distinctions==
Émile Coué identified two very different types of self-suggestion:
* intentional, &quot;&quot;reflective autosuggestion&quot;: made by deliberate and conscious effort, and
* unintentional, &quot;spontaneous auto-suggestion&quot;&quot;: which is a &quot;natural phenomenon of our mental life … which takes place without conscious effort [and has its effect] with an intensity proportional to the keenness of [our] attention&quot;.

In relation to Coué&#x27;s group of &quot;spontaneous auto-suggestions&quot;, his student Charles Baudouin (1920, p. 41) made three further useful distinctions, based upon the sources from which they came:
* &quot;Instances belonging to the representative domain   (sensations, mental images, dreams, visions, memories, opinions, and all intellectual phenomena).&quot;
* &quot;Instances belonging to the affective domain   (joy or sorrow, emotions, sentiments, tendencies, passions).&quot;
* &quot;Instances belonging to the active or motor domain   (actions, volitions, desires, gestures, movements at the periphery or in the interior of the body, functional or organic modifications).&quot;

==Émile Coué==
Émile Coué, who had both B.A. and B.Sc. degrees before he was 21, graduated top of his class (with First Class Honours) with a degree in pharmacology from the prestigious Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris in 1882. Having spent an additional six months as an intern at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris, he returned to Troyes, where he worked as an apothecary from 1882 to 1910.

===&quot;Hypnosis&quot; à la Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault and Hippolyte Bernheim===
In 1885, his investigations of hypnotism and the power of the imagination began with Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault and Hippolyte Bernheim, two leading exponents of &quot;hypnosis&quot;, of Nancy, with whom he studied in 1885 and 1886 (having taken leave from his business in Troyes). Following this training, &quot;he dabbled with ‘hypnosis’ in Troyes in 1886, but soon discovered that their Liébeault&#x27;s techniques were hopeless, and abandoned ‘hypnosis’ altogether&quot;.

===Hypnotism à la James Braid and Xenophon LaMotte Sage===
In 1901, Coué sent to the United States for a free book, &quot;Hypnotism as It is&quot; (i.e., Sage, 1900a), which purported to disclose &quot;secrets [of the] science that brings business and social success&quot; and &quot;the hidden mysteries of personal magnetism, hypnotism, magnetic healing, etc.&quot;. Deeply impressed by its contents, he purchased the French language version of the associated correspondence course (i.e., Sage, 1900b, and 1900c), created by stage hypnotist extraordinaire, &quot;Professor Xenophon LaMotte Sage, A.M., Ph.D., LL.D., of Rochester, New York&quot; (who had been admitted into the prestigious &quot;Medico-Legal Society of New York&quot; in 1899).

In real life, Xenophon LaMotte Sage was none other than Ewing Virgil Neal (1868-1949), the multi-millionaire, calligrapher, hypnotist, publisher, advertising/marketing pioneer (he launched the career of Carl R. Byoir), pharmaceutical manufacturer, parfumier, international businessman, confidant of Mussolini, Commandatore of the Order of the Crown of Italy, Officer of the Legion of Honour, and fugitive from justice, who moved to France in the 1920s.

Sage&#x27;s course supplied the missing piece of the puzzle — namely, Braid-style hypnotic inductions — the solution for which had, up to that time, eluded Coué: 
::     &quot;Coué immediately recognised that the course’s Braid-style of hypnotism was ideal for &quot;mental therapeutics&quot;. He undertook an intense study, and was soon skilled enough to offer hypnotism alongside his pharmaceutical enterprise. In the context of Liébeault’s ‘hypnosis’, Braid’s hypnotism, and Coué’s (later) discoveries about autosuggestion, one must recognise the substantially different orientations of Liébeault’s &quot;&quot;suggestive therapeutics&quot;, which concentrated on imposing the coercive power of the operator’s suggestion, and Braid’s &quot;psycho-physiology&quot;&quot;, which concentrated on activating the transformative power of the subject’s mind.&quot;

Although he had abandoned Liébeault&#x27;s &quot;hypnosis&quot; in 1886, he adopted Braid&#x27;s &quot;hypnotism&quot; in 1901; and, in fact, in addition to, and (often) separate from, his auto-suggestive practices, Coué actively used Braid&#x27;s hypnotism for the rest of his professional life.

==Suggestion and Auto-suggestion==

Coué was so deeply impressed by Bernheim&#x27;s concept of “suggestive therapeutics” — in effect, &quot;an imperfect re-branding of the ‘dominant idea’ theory that Braid had appropriated from Thomas Brown&quot; — that, on his return to Troyes from his (1886–1886) interlude with Liébeault and Bernheim, he made a practice of reassuring his clients by praising each remedy&#x27;s efficacy. He noticed that, in specific cases, he could increase a medicine&#x27;s efficacy by praising its effectiveness. He realized that, when compared with those to whom he said nothing, those to whom he praised the medicine had a noticeable improvement (this is suggestive of what would later be identified as a &quot;placebo response&quot;).
:     &quot;Around 1903, Coué recommended a new patent medicine, based on its promotional material, which effected an unexpected and immediate cure (Baudouin, 1920, p.90; Shrout, 1985, p.36). Coué (the chemist) found “[by subsequent] chemical analysis in his laboratory [that there was] nothing in the medicine which by the remotest stretch of the imagination accounted for the results” (Shrout, ibid.). Coué (the hypnotist) concluded that it was cure by suggestion; but, rather than Coué having cured him, the man had cured himself by &quot;continuously telling himself the same thing that Coué had told him&quot;.&quot;

==The birth of &quot;Conscious Autosuggestion&quot;==
Coué discovered that subjects could not be hypnotized against their will and, more importantly, that the effects of hypnotic suggestion waned when the subjects regained consciousness. He thus eventually developed the Coué method, and released his first book, &quot;Self-Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion&quot; (published in 1920 in England and two years later in the United States). He described autosuggestion itself as:
Although Coué never doubted pharmaceutical medicine, and still advocated its application, he also came to believe that one&#x27;s mental state could positively affect, and even amplify, the pharmaceutical action of medication. He observed that those patients who used his mantra-like conscious suggestion, &quot;Every day, in every way, I&#x27;m getting better and better&quot;, (French: &quot;Tous les jours, à tous points de vue, je vais de mieux en mieux&quot;; lit. &#x27;Every day, from all points of view, I&#x27;m getting better and better&#x27;) — in his view, replacing their &quot;thought of illness&quot; with a new &quot;thought of cure&quot;, could augment their pharmaceutical regimen in an efficacious way.

==The Coué method==

The Coué method centers on a routine repetition of this particular expression according to a specified ritual, in a given physical state, and in the absence of any sort of allied mental imagery, at the beginning and at the end of each day. Coué maintained that curing some of our troubles requires a change in our subconscious/unconscious thought, which can only be achieved by using our imagination. Although stressing that he was not primarily a healer but one who taught others to heal themselves, Coué claimed to have affected organic changes through autosuggestion.

===Underlying principles===
Coué thus developed a method which relied on the belief that &quot;any idea exclusively occupying the mind turns into reality&quot;, although only to the extent that the idea is within the realm of possibility. For instance, a person without hands will not be able to make them grow back. However, if a person firmly believes that his or her asthma is disappearing, then this may actually happen, as far as the body is actually able to physically overcome or control the illness. On the other hand, thinking negatively about the illness (e.g. &quot;I am not feeling well&quot;) will encourage both mind and body to accept this thought.

===Willpower===
Coué observed that the main obstacle to autosuggestion was willpower. For the method to work, the patient must refrain from making any independent judgment, meaning that he must not let his will impose its own views on positive ideas. Everything must thus be done to ensure that the positive &quot;autosuggestive&quot; idea is consciously &quot;accepted&quot; by the patient, otherwise one may end up getting the opposite effect of what is desired.

Coué noted that young children always applied his method perfectly, as they lacked the willpower that remained present among adults. When he instructed a child by saying &quot;clasp your hands&quot; and then &quot;you can&#x27;t pull them apart&quot; the child would thus immediately follow his instructions and be unable to unclasp their hands.

=== Self-conflict ===
Coué believed a patient&#x27;s problems were likely to increase if his willpower and imagination opposed each other, something Coué referred to as &quot;self-conflict.&quot; As the conflict intensifies, so does the problem i.e., the more the patient consciously wants to sleep, the more he becomes awake. The patient must thus abandon his willpower and instead put more focus on his imaginative power in order to fully succeed with his cure.

===Effectiveness===
With his method, which Coué called &quot;un truc,&quot; patients of all sorts would come to visit him. The list of ailments included kidney problems, diabetes, memory loss, stammering, weakness, atrophy and all sorts of physical and mental illnesses. According to one of his journal entries (1916), he apparently cured a patient of a uterus prolapse as well as &quot;violent pains in the head&quot; (migraine).

===Evidence===
Advocates of autosuggestion appeal to brief case histories published by Émile Coué describing his use of autohypnosis to cure, for example, enteritis and paralysis from spinal cord injury.

==Autogenic training==

Autogenic training is an autosuggestion-centered relaxation technique influenced by the Coué method. In 1932, German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz developed and published on autogenic training.

===Conceptual difference from Autosuggestion===
By contrast with the conceptualization driving Coué&#x27;s auto-suggestive self-administration procedure — namely, that constant repetition creates a situation in which &quot;a particular idea saturates the microcognitive environment of &#x27;the mind&#x27;…&quot;, which, then, in its turn, &quot;is converted into a corresponding ideomotor, ideosensory, or ideoaffective action, by the &quot;ideodynamic principle of action&quot;&quot;, &quot;which then, in its turn, generates the response&quot; — the primary target of the entirely different self-administration procedure developed by Johannes Heinrich Schultz, known as &quot;Autogenic Training&quot;, was to affect the autonomic nervous system, rather than (as Coué&#x27;s did) to affect &#x27;the mind&#x27;.

===Efficacy of Autogenic training===
Although, as Myga, Kuehn &amp; Azanon (2022) observe, there has been very little research into autosuggestion, there have been a number of clinical trials supporting the efficacy-claims for autogenic training; and, along with other relaxation techniques such as progressive relaxation and meditation has replaced Coué&#x27;s method in therapy.

Wolfgang Luthe (Schultz&#x27;s co-author) was a firm believer that autogenic training was a powerful approach that should only be offered to patients by qualified professionals.

<text>In algebra, synthetic division is a method for manually performing Euclidean division of polynomials, with less writing and fewer calculations than long division.

It is mostly taught for division by linear monic polynomials (known as Ruffini&#x27;s rule), but the method can be generalized to division by any polynomial.

The advantages of synthetic division are that it allows one to calculate without writing variables, it uses few calculations, and it takes significantly less space on paper than long division. Also, the subtractions in long division are converted to additions by switching the signs at the very beginning, helping to prevent sign errors.

== Regular synthetic division ==
The first example is synthetic division with only a monic linear denominator formula_1.

:formula_2

The numerator can be written as formula_3.

The zero of the denominator formula_4 is formula_5.

The coefficients of formula_6 are arranged as follows, with the zero of formula_4 on the left: 

:formula_8

The after the bar is &quot;dropped&quot; to the last row.
:formula_9

The is multiplied by the before the bar and placed in the .
:formula_10

An is performed in the next column.
:formula_11

The previous two steps are repeated, and the following is obtained:
:formula_12

Here, the last term (-123) is the remainder while the rest correspond to the coefficients of the quotient. 
The terms are written with increasing degree from right to left beginning with degree zero for the remainder and the result.
:formula_13

Hence the quotient and remainder are:

:formula_14
:formula_15

===Evaluating polynomials by the remainder theorem===

The above form of synthetic division is useful in the context of the polynomial remainder theorem for evaluating univariate polynomials. To summarize, the value of formula_6 at formula_17 is equal to the remainder of the division of formula_6 by formula_19

The advantage of calculating the value this way is that it requires just over half as many multiplication steps as naive evaluation. An alternative evaluation strategy is Horner&#x27;s method.

== Expanded synthetic division ==
This method generalizes to division by any monic polynomial with only a slight modification with changes in bold. Note that while it may not be displayed in the following example, the divisor must also be written with verbose coefficients. (Such as with formula_20) Using the same steps as before, perform the following division:
:formula_21

We concern ourselves only with the coefficients.
Write the coefficients of the polynomial to be divided at the top.
:formula_22

Negate the coefficients of the divisor. 
:formula_23

Write in every coefficient but the first one on the left in an upward right diagonal (see next diagram).
:formula_24

Note the change of sign from 1 to −1 and from −3 to 3. &quot;Drop&quot; the first coefficient after the bar to the last row.

:formula_25

Multiply the dropped number by the diagonal before the bar and place the resulting entries diagonally to the right from the dropped entry.
:formula_26

Perform an addition in the next column.
:formula_27

Repeat the previous two steps until you would go past the entries at the top with the next diagonal.
:formula_28

Then simply add up any remaining columns.
:formula_29

Count the terms to the left of the bar. Since there are two, the remainder has degree one and this is the two right-most terms under the bar. Mark the separation with a vertical bar.
:formula_30
The terms are written with increasing degree from right to left beginning with degree zero for both the remainder and the result.
:formula_31

The result of our division is:
:formula_32

=== For non-monic divisors ===

With a little prodding, the expanded technique may be generalised even further to work for any polynomial, not just monics. The usual way of doing this would be to divide the divisor formula_4 with its leading coefficient (call it &quot;a&quot;):
:formula_34

then using synthetic division with formula_35 as the divisor, and then dividing the quotient by &quot;a&quot; to get the quotient of the original division (the remainder stays the same). But this often produces unsightly fractions which get removed later and is thus more prone to error. It is possible to do it without first reducing the coefficients of formula_4.

As can be observed by first performing long division with such a non-monic divisor, the coefficients of formula_37 are divided by the leading coefficient of formula_4 after &quot;dropping&quot;, and before multiplying.

Let&#x27;s illustrate by performing the following division:

:formula_39

A slightly modified table is used:

:formula_40

Note the extra row at the bottom. This is used to write values found by dividing the &quot;dropped&quot; values by the leading coefficient of formula_4 (in this case, indicated by the &quot;/3&quot;; note that, unlike the rest of the coefficients of formula_4, the sign of this number is not changed).

Next, the first coefficient of formula_37 is dropped as usual:

:formula_44

and then the dropped value is divided by 3 and placed in the row below:

:formula_45

Next, the new (divided) value is used to fill the top rows with multiples of 2 and 1, as in the expanded technique:

:formula_46

The 5 is dropped next, with the obligatory adding of the 4 below it, and the answer is divided again:

:formula_47

Then the 3 is used to fill the top rows:

:formula_48

At this point, if, after getting the third sum, we were to try and use it to fill the top rows, we would &quot;fall off&quot; the right side, thus the third sum is the first coefficient of the remainder, as in regular synthetic division. But the values of the remainder are not divided by the leading coefficient of the divisor:

:formula_49

Now we can read off the coefficients of the answer. As in expanded synthetic division, the last two values (2 is the degree of the divisor) are the coefficients of the remainder, and the remaining values are the coefficients of the quotient:

:formula_50

and the result is

:formula_51

=== Compact Expanded Synthetic Division ===

However, the diagonal format above becomes less space-efficient when the degree of the divisor exceeds half of the degree of the dividend. Consider the following division:

:formula_52

It is easy to see that we have complete freedom to write each product in any row as long as it is in the correct column, so the algorithm can be compactified by a greedy strategy, as illustrated in the division below:

:formula_53

The following describes how to perform the algorithm; this algorithm includes steps for dividing non-monic divisors:

=== Python implementation ===

The following snippet implements Expanded Synthetic Division in Python for arbitrary univariate polynomials:
def expanded_synthetic_division(dividend, divisor):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Fast polynomial division by using Expanded Synthetic Division. 
 Also works with non-monic polynomials.

 Dividend and divisor are both polynomials, which are here simply lists of coefficients. 
 E.g.: x**2 + 3*x + 5 will be represented as [1, 3, 5]
 out = list(dividend) # Copy the dividend
 normalizer = divisor[0]
 for i in range(len(dividend) - len(divisor) + 1):
 # For general polynomial division (when polynomials are non-monic),
 # we need to normalize by dividing the coefficient with the divisor&#x27;s first coefficient
 out[i] /= normalizer

 coef = out[i]
 if coef != 0: # Useless to multiply if coef is 0
 # In synthetic division, we always skip the first coefficient of the divisor,
 # because it is only used to normalize the dividend coefficients
 for j in range(1, len(divisor)):
 out[i + j] += -divisor[j] * coef

 # The resulting out contains both the quotient and the remainder,
 # the remainder being the size of the divisor (the remainder
 # has necessarily the same degree as the divisor since it is
 # what we couldn&#x27;t divide from the dividend), so we compute the index
 # where this separation is, and return the quotient and remainder.
 separator = 1 - len(divisor)
 return out[:separator], out[separator:] # Return quotient, remainder.

<doc id="314725" wikidata="Q1233528" url="?curid=314725" title="William Lane Craig">
<text>William Lane Craig (; born August 23, 1949) is an American analytic philosopher, Christian apologist, author, and theologian. He is a professor of philosophy at Houston Christian University and at the Talbot School of Theology of Biola University.

Craig has updated and defended the Kalam cosmological argument for the existence of God. He has also published work where he argues in favor of the historical plausibility of the resurrection of Jesus. His study of divine aseity and Platonism culminated with his book &quot;God Over All&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Craig was born August 23, 1949, in Peoria, Illinois, to Mallory and Doris Craig. He attended East Peoria Community High School from 1963 to 1967, where he competed in debate and won the state championship in oratory. In September 1965, his junior year, he became a Christian.

After graduating from high school, Craig attended Wheaton College, majoring in communications. He graduated in 1971 and married his wife, Jan, whom he met on the staff of Campus Crusade for Christ, the next year. They have two grown children and reside in suburban Atlanta, Georgia.

In 1973, Craig entered the program in philosophy of religion at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School north of Chicago, where he studied under Norman Geisler. In 1975, Craig began doctoral studies in philosophy at the University of Birmingham in England, writing on the cosmological argument under the direction of John Hick. He was awarded a doctorate in 1977. Out of this study came his first book, &quot;The Kalam Cosmological Argument&quot; (1979), a defense of the argument he first encountered in theologian Stuart Hackett&#x27;s work on the same topic.

Craig was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship in 1978 from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to pursue research on the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus under the direction of Wolfhart Pannenberg at the University of Munich in Germany. His studies in Munich under Pannenberg&#x27;s supervision led to a second doctorate, this one in theology, awarded in 1984 with the publication of his doctoral thesis, &quot;The Historical Argument for the Resurrection of Jesus During the Deist Controversy&quot; (1985).

==Career==
Craig joined the faculty of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois in 1980, where he taught philosophy of religion until 1986.

After a one-year stint at Westmont College on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, Craig moved in 1987 with his wife and two young children back to Europe, where he was a visiting scholar at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Louvain) in Belgium until 1994. At that time, Craig joined the Department of Philosophy and Ethics at Talbot School of Theology in suburban Los Angeles as a research professor of philosophy, a position he currently holds, and he went on to become a professor of philosophy at Houston Christian University in 2014. In 2017, Biola University created a permanent faculty position and endowed chair, the William Lane Craig Endowed Chair in Philosophy, in honor of Craig&#x27;s academic contributions.

Craig served as president of the Philosophy of Time Society from 1999 to 2006. He helped revitalize the Evangelical Philosophical Society and served as its president from 1996 to 2005. In the mid-2000s, Craig established the online Christian apologetics ministry ReasonableFaith.org.

Craig has authored or edited over forty books and over two hundred articles published in professional philosophy and theology journals, including: &quot;The Journal of Philosophy&quot;, &quot;British Journal for the Philosophy of Science&quot;,&quot; Philosophy and Phenomenological Research,&quot;&quot; Philosophical Studies&quot;, &quot;Australasian Journal of Philosophy,&quot; &quot;Faith and Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Erkenntnis&quot;, and &quot;American Philosophical Quarterly.&quot;

== Philosophical and theological views ==

===Kalam cosmological argument===
Craig has written and spoken in defense of a version of the cosmological argument called the &quot;Kalam cosmological argument&quot;. While the Kalam originated in medieval Islamic philosophy, Craig added appeals to scientific and philosophical ideas in the argument&#x27;s defense. Craig&#x27;s work has resulted in contemporary interest in the argument, and in cosmological arguments in general.

Craig formulates his version of the argument as follows: 
# Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence.
# The universe began to exist. 
# Therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence.

Craig&#x27;s defense of the argument mainly focuses on the second premise, which he offers several arguments for. For example, Craig appeals to Hilbert&#x27;s example of an infinite hotel to argue that actually infinite collections are impossible, and thus the past is finite and has a beginning. In another argument, Craig says that the series of events in time is formed by a process in which each moment is added to history in succession. According to Craig, this process can never produce an actually infinite collection of events, but at best a potentially infinite one. On this basis, he argues that the past is finite and has a beginning.

Craig also appeals to various physical theories to support the argument&#x27;s second premise, such as the standard Big Bang model of cosmic origins and certain implications of the second law of thermodynamics.

The Kalam argument concludes that the universe had a cause, but Craig further argues that the cause must be a person. First, Craig argues that the best way to explain the origin of a temporal effect with a beginning from an eternally existing cause is if that cause is a personal agent endowed with free will. Second, the only candidates for a timeless, spaceless, immaterial being are abstract objects like numbers or unembodied minds; but abstract objects are causally effete. Third, Craig uses Richard Swinburne&#x27;s separation of causal explanation; causal explanation can be given in terms either of initial conditions and laws of nature or of a personal agent and its volitions; but a first physical state of the universe cannot be explained in terms of initial conditions and natural laws.

Craig&#x27;s arguments to support the Kalam argument have been discussed and debated by a variety of commentators, including Adolf Grünbaum, Quentin Smith, Wes Morriston, Graham Oppy, Andrew Loke, Robert C. Koons, and Alexander Pruss. Many of these papers are contained in the two-volume anthology &quot;The Kalām Cosmological Argument&quot; (2017), volume 1 covering philosophical arguments for the finitude of the past and volume 2 the scientific evidence for the beginning of the universe.

===Divine omniscience===
Craig is a proponent of Molinism, an idea first formulated by the Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina according to which God possesses foreknowledge of which free actions each person would perform under every possible circumstance, a kind of knowledge that is sometimes termed &quot;middle knowledge&quot;. Protestant-Molinism, such as Craig&#x27;s, first entered Protestant theology through two anti-Calvinist thinkers: Jacobus Arminius and Conrad Vorstius. Molinists such as Craig appeal to this idea to reconcile the perceived conflict between God&#x27;s providence and foreknowledge with human free will. The idea is that, by relying on middle knowledge, God does not interfere with anyone&#x27;s free will, instead choosing which circumstances to actualize given a complete understanding of how people would freely choose to act in response. Craig also appeals to Molinism in his discussions of the inspiration of scripture, Christian exclusivism, the perseverance of the Saints, and missionary evangelism.

===Resurrection of Jesus===
Craig has written two volumes arguing for the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus, &quot;The Historical Argument for the Resurrection of Jesus&quot; (1985) and &quot;Assessing the New Testament Evidence for the Historicity of the Resurrection of Jesus&quot; (3rd ed., 2002). In the former volume, Craig describes the history of the discussion, including David Hume&#x27;s arguments against the identification of miracles. The latter volume is an exegetical study of the New Testament material pertinent to the resurrection.

Craig structures his arguments for the historicity of the resurrection under 3 headings:
# The tomb of Jesus was found empty by a group of his female followers on the Sunday after his crucifixion.
# Various individuals and groups experienced appearances of Jesus alive after his death.
#The earliest disciples came to believe that God had raised Jesus from the dead despite strong predispositions to the contrary.
Craig argues that the best explanation of these three events is a literal resurrection. He applies an evaluative framework developed by philosopher of history C. Behan McCullagh to examine various theoretical explanations proposed for these events. From that framework, he rejects alternative theories such as Gerd Lüdemann&#x27;s hallucination hypothesis, the conspiracy hypothesis, and Heinrich Paulus or Friedrich Schleiermacher&#x27;s apparent death hypothesis as lacking explanatory scope, explanatory power, and sufficient historical plausibility. In 1996 Craig participated in the Resurrection Summit, a meeting held at St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary, New York, in order to discuss the resurrection of Jesus. Papers from the summit were later compiled and published in the book &quot;The Resurrection. An Interdisciplinary Symposium on the Resurrection of Jesus&quot;, edited by S.T Davis, D. Kendall and G. O&#x27;Collins.

===Philosophy of time===
Craig defends a presentist version of the A-theory of time. According to this theory, the present exists, but the past and future do not. Additionally, he holds that there are tensed facts, such as &quot;it is now lunchtime&quot;, which cannot be reduced to or identified with tenseless facts of the form &quot;it is lunchtime at noon on February 10, 2020.&quot; According to this theory, presentness is a real aspect of time, and not merely a projection of our thought and talk about time. He raises several defenses of this theory, two of which are especially notable. First, he criticizes J. M. E. McTaggart&#x27;s argument that the A-theory is incoherent, suggesting that McTaggart&#x27;s argument begs the question by covertly presupposing the B-theory. Second, he defends the A-theory from empirical challenges arising from the standard interpretation of Einstein&#x27;s Special Theory of Relativity (SR). He responds to this challenge by advocating a neo-Lorentzian interpretation of SR which is empirically equivalent to the standard interpretation, and which is consistent with the A-theory and with absolute simultaneity. Craig criticizes the standard interpretation of SR on the grounds that it is based on a discredited positivist epistemology. Moreover, he claims that the assumption of positivism invalidates the appeal to SR made by opponents of the A-theory.
=== Divine eternity ===
Craig argues that God existed in a timeless state causally prior to creation, but has existed in a temporal state beginning with creation, by virtue of his knowledge of tensed facts and his interactions with events. He gives two arguments in support of that view. First, he says that, given his tensed view of time, God cannot be timeless once he has created a temporal universe, since, after that point, he is related to time through his interactions and through causing events in time. Second, Craig says that as a feature of his omniscience, God must know the truth related to tensed facts about the world, such as whether the statement &quot;Today is January 15th&quot; is true or not or what is happening &quot;right now&quot;.

===Divine aseity===
Craig has published on the challenge posed by platonism to divine aseity or self-existence. Craig rejects both the view that God creates abstract objects and that they exist independently of God. Rather, he defends a nominalistic perspective that abstract objects are not ontologically real objects. Stating that the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument is the chief support of platonism, Craig criticizes the neo-Quinean criterion of ontological commitment, according to which the existential quantifier of first order logic and singular terms are devices of ontological commitment.
Craig favors a neutral interpretation of the quantifiers of first-order logic, so that a statement can be true, even if there isn&#x27;t an object being quantified over. Moreover, he defends a deflationary theory of reference based on the intentionality of agents, so that a person can successfully refer to something even in the absence of some extra-mental thing. Craig gives the example of the statement “the price of the ticket is ten dollars” which he argues can still be a true statement even if there isn&#x27;t an actual object called a “price.” He defines these references as a speech act rather than a word-world relation, so that singular terms may be used in true sentences without commitment to corresponding objects in the world. Craig has additionally argued that even if one were to grant that these references were being used as in a word-world relation, that fictionalism is a viable explanation of their use; in particular pretense theory, according to which statements about abstract objects are expressions of make-believe, imagined to be true, even if literally false.

===Atonement===
In preparation for writing a systematic philosophical theology, Craig undertook a study of the doctrine of the atonement which resulted in two books, &quot;The Atonement&quot; (2019) and &quot;Atonement and the Death of Christ&quot; (2020).

===Historical Adam===
Also as a preliminary study for his systematic philosophical theology Craig explored the biblical commitment to and scientific credibility of an original human pair who were the universal progenitors of mankind. Following the Assyriologist Thorkild Jacobsen, Craig argues on the basis of various family resemblances that Genesis 1-11 plausibly belongs to the genre of mytho-history, which aims to recount historical persons and events in the figurative and often fantastic language of myth. Most recently Craig has begun writing a projected multi-volume systematic philosophical theology.

===Other views===
Craig is a critic of metaphysical naturalism, New Atheism, and prosperity theology, as well as a defender of Reformed epistemology. He also states that a confessing Christian should not engage in homosexual acts. Craig maintains that the theory of evolution is compatible with Christianity. He is a fellow of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture and was a fellow of the International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design. In his debate with Paul Helm, Craig explains that he would call himself an &quot;Arminian&quot; &quot;in the proper sense.&quot; Elsewhere, he has described himself as a Wesleyan or Wesleyan-Arminian.

As a non-voluntaristic divine command theorist, Craig believes God had the moral right to command the killing of the Canaanites if they refused to leave their land, as depicted in the Book of Deuteronomy. This has led to some controversy, as seen in a critique by Wes Morriston. Craig has also proposed a neo-Apollinarian Christology in which the divine logos stands in for the human soul of Christ and completes his human nature.

==Reception==
According to Nathan Schneider, &quot;[many] professional philosophers know about him only vaguely, but in the field of philosophy of religion, [Craig&#x27;s] books and articles are among the most cited&quot;. Fellow philosopher Quentin Smith writes that &quot;William Lane Craig is one [of] the leading philosophers of religion and one of the leading philosophers of time.&quot;

In 2021, Academic Influence ranked Craig the nineteenth most influential philosopher in the world over the previous three decades (1990-2020) and the world&#x27;s fourth most influential theologian over the same period.

In 2009, New Atheist Christopher Hitchens had an interview before his debate with Craig in that same year. During that interview, Hitchens said: &quot;I can tell you that my brothers and sisters and co-thinkers in the unbelieving community take [Craig] very seriously. He&#x27;s thought of as a very tough guy. Very rigorous, very scholarly, very formidable. [...] I say that without reserve. I don&#x27;t say it because I&#x27;m here. Normally, I don&#x27;t get people saying: &#x27;Good luck tonight&#x27; and &#x27;don&#x27;t let us down&#x27;, you know. But with him, I do.&quot;

In 2011, with respect and compliment to his debating skills, New Atheist Sam Harris once described Craig as &quot;the one Christian apologist who seems to have put the fear of God into many of my fellow atheists&quot;.

Following a 2011 debate with Craig, Lawrence Krauss stated that Craig had a &quot;simplistic view of the world&quot; and that in the debate, Craig had said &quot;disingenuous distortions, simplifications, and outright lies&quot;.

In 2014, he was named alumnus of the year by Wheaton College.

In 2016, Craig was named Alumnus of the Year by Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.

<doc id="314730" wikidata="Q3099696" url="?curid=314730" title="Monic polynomial">
<text>In algebra, a monic polynomial is a non-zero univariate polynomial (that is, a polynomial in a single variable) in which the leading coefficient (the nonzero coefficient of highest degree) is equal to 1. That is to say, a monic polynomial is one that can be written as
:formula_1
with formula_2

== Uses ==
Monic polynomials are widely used in algebra and number theory, since they produce many simplifications and they avoid divisions and denominators. Here are some examples.

Every polynomial is associated to a unique monic polynomial. In particular, the unique factorization property of polynomials can be stated as: &quot;Every polynomial can be uniquely factorized as the product of its leading coefficient and a product of monic irreducible polynomials.&quot;

Vieta&#x27;s formulas are simpler in the case of monic polynomials: &quot;The th elementary symmetric function of the roots of a monic polynomial of degree equals formula_3 where formula_4 is the coefficient of the th power of the indeterminate.&quot;

Euclidean division of a polynomial by a monic polynomial does not introduce divisions of coefficients. Therefore, it is defined for polynomials with coefficients in a commutative ring.

Algebraic integers are defined as the roots of monic polynomials with integer coefficients.

== Properties ==
Every nonzero univariate polynomial (polynomial with a single indeterminate) can be written 
:formula_5
where formula_6 are the coefficients of the polynomial, and the leading coefficient formula_7 is not zero. By definition, such a polynomial is &quot;monic&quot; if formula_8

A product of monic polynomials is monic. A product of polynomials is monic if and only if the product of the leading coefficients of the factors equals .

This implies that, the monic polynomials in a univariate polynomial ring over a commutative ring form a monoid under polynomial multiplication.

Two monic polynomials are associated if and only if they are equal, since the multiplication of a polynomial by a nonzero constant produces a polynomial with this constant as its leading coefficient.

Divisibility induces a partial order on monic polynomials. This results almost immediately from the preceding properties.

==Polynomial equations==

Let formula_9 be a polynomial equation, where is a univariate polynomial of degree . If one divides all coefficients of by its leading coefficient formula_10 one obtains a new polynomial equation that has the same solutions and consists to equate to zero a monic polynomial.

For example, the equation
:formula_11
is equivalent to the monic equation
:formula_12

When the coefficients are unspecified, or belong to a field where division does not result into fractions (such as formula_13 or a finite field), this reduction to monic equations may provide simplification. On the other hand, as shown by the previous example, when the coefficients are explicit integers, the associated monic polynomial is generally more complicated. Therefore, primitive polynomials are often used instead of monic polynomials when dealing with integer coefficients.

==Integral elements==
Monic polynomial equations are at the basis of the theory of algebraic integers, and, more generally of integral elements.

Let be a subring of a field ; this implies that is an integral domain. An element of is &quot;integral&quot; over if it is a root of a monic polynomial with coefficients in .

A complex number that is integral over the integers is called an algebraic integer. This terminology is motivated by the fact that the integers are exactly the rational numbers that are also algebraic integers. This results from the rational root theorem, which asserts that, if the rational number formula_14 is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, then is a divisor of the leading coefficient; so, if the polynomial is monic, then formula_15 and the number is an integer. Conversely, an integer is a root of the monic polynomial formula_16

It can be proved that, if two elements of a field are integral over a subring of , then the sum and the product of these elements are also integral over . It follows that the elements of that are integral over form a ring, called the integral closure of in . An integral domain that equals its integral closure in its field of fractions is called an integrally closed domain.

These concepts are fundamental in algebraic number theory. For example, many of the numerous wrong proofs of the Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem that have been written during more than three centuries were wrong because the authors supposed wrongly that the algebraic integers in an algebraic number field have unique factorization.

== Multivariate polynomials ==
Ordinarily, the term &quot;monic&quot; is not employed for polynomials of several variables. However, a polynomial in several variables may be regarded as a polynomial in one variable with coefficients being polynomials in the other variables. Being &quot;monic&quot; depends thus on the choice of one &quot;main&quot; variable. For example, the polynomial
:formula_17
is monic, if considered as a polynomial in with coefficients that are polynomials in :
:formula_18
but it is not monic when considered as a polynomial in with coefficients polynomial in :
:formula_19

In the context of Gröbner bases, a monomial order is generally fixed. In this case, a polynomial may be said to be monic, if it has 1 as its leading coefficient (for the monomial order).

For every definition, a product of monic polynomials is monic, and, if the coefficients belong to a field, every polynomial is associated to exactly one monic polynomial.

<text>The Roman provinces (, pl. ) were the administrative regions of Ancient Rome outside Roman Italy that were controlled by the Romans under the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire. Each province was ruled by a Roman appointed as governor.

For centuries, it was the largest administrative unit of the foreign possessions of ancient Rome. With the administrative reform initiated by Diocletian, it became a third level administrative subdivision of the Roman Empire, or rather a subdivision of the imperial dioceses (in turn subdivisions of the imperial prefectures).

== History ==

A province was the basic and, until the Tetrarchy (from AD 293), the largest territorial and administrative unit of the empire&#x27;s territorial possessions outside Roman Italy.

During the republic and early empire, provinces were generally governed by politicians of senatorial rank, usually former consuls or former praetors. A later exception was the province of Egypt, which was incorporated by Augustus after the death of Cleopatra and was ruled by a governor of only equestrian rank, perhaps as a discouragement to senatorial ambition. That exception was unique but not contrary to Roman law, as Egypt was considered Augustus&#x27;s personal property, following the tradition of the kings of the earlier Hellenistic period.

=== Republican period ===

The English word &quot;province&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;provincia&quot;. The Latin term &quot;provincia&quot; had an equivalent in eastern, Greek-speaking parts of the Greco-Roman world. In the Greek language, a province was called an &quot;eparchy&quot; (, &quot;eparchia&quot;), with a governor called an &quot;eparch&quot; (, &quot;eparchos&quot;).

==== Emergence ====

The Latin , during the middle republic, referred not to a territory, but to a task assigned to a Roman magistrate. That task might require using the military command powers of &quot;imperium&quot; but otherwise could even be a task assigned to a junior magistrates without &quot;imperium&quot;: for example, the treasury was the of a quaestor and the civil jurisdiction of the urban praetor was the . In the middle and late republican authors like Plautus, Terence, and Cicero, the word referred something akin to a modern ministerial portfolio: &quot;when... the senate assigned to the various magistrates... what they were doing was more like allocating a portfolio than putting people in charge of geographic areas&quot;.

The first commanders dispatched with were for the purpose of waging war and to command an army. However, merely that a &quot;provincia&quot; was assigned did not mean the Romans made that territory theirs. For example, Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus in 211 BC received Macedonia as his &quot;provincia&quot; but the republic did not annex the kingdom, even as Macedonia was continuously assigned until 205 BC with the end of the First Macedonian War. Even though the Second and Third Macedonian Wars saw the Macedonian province revived, the senate settled affairs in the region by abolishing Macedonia and replacing it with four client republics. Macedonia only came under direct Roman administration in the aftermath of the Fourth Macedonian War in 148 BC. Similarly, assignment of various in Hispania was not accompanied by the creation of any regular administration of the area; indeed, even though two praetors were assigned to Hispania regularly from 196 BC, no systematic settlement of the region occurred for nearly thirty years and what administration occurred was &quot;ad hoc&quot; and emerged from military necessities.

In the middle republic, the administration of a territory – whether taxation or jurisdiction – had basically no relationship with whether that place was assigned as a &quot;provincia&quot; by the senate. Rome would even intervene on territorial disputes which were part of no &quot;provincia&quot; at all and were not administered by Rome. The territorial province, called a &quot;permanent&quot; &quot;provincia&quot; in the scholarship, emerged only gradually.

==== Permanent &quot;provincia&quot; ====

The acquisition of territories, however, through the middle republic created the recurrent task of defending and administering some place. The first &quot;permanent&quot; was that of Sicily, created after the First Punic War. In the immediate aftermath, a quaestor was sent to Sicily to look out for Roman interests but eventually, praetors were dispatched as well. The sources differ as to when sending a praetor became normal: Appian reports 241 BC; Solinus indicates 227 BC instead. Regardless, the change likely reflected Roman unease about Carthaginian power: quaestors could not command armies or fleets; praetors could and initially seem to have held largely garrison duties. This first province started a permanent shift in Roman thinking about . Instead of being a task of military expansion, it became a recurrent defensive assignment to oversee conquered territories. These defensive assignments, with few opportunities to gain glory, were less desirable and therefore became regularly assigned to the praetors. 

Only around 180 BC did provinces take on a more geographically defined position when a border was established to separate the two commanders assigned to Hispania on the river Baetis. Later provinces, once campaigns were complete, were all largely defined geographically. Once this division of permanent and temporary emerged, magistrates assigned to permanent provinces also came under pressures to achieve as much as possible during their terms. Whenever a military crisis occurred near some province, it was normally reassigned to one of the consuls; praetors were left with the garrison duties. In the permanent provinces, the Roman commanders were initially not intended as administrators. However, the presence of the commander with forces sufficient to coerce compliance made him an obvious place to seek final judgement. A governor&#x27;s legal jurisdiction thus grew from the demands of the provincial inhabitants for authoritative settlement of disputes. 

In the absence of opportunities for conquest and with little oversight for their activities, many praetorian governors settled on extorting the provincials. This profiteering threatened Roman control by unnecessarily angering the province&#x27;s subject populations and was regardless dishonourable. It eventually drew a reaction from the senate, which reacted with laws to rein in the governors. After initial experimentation with &quot;ad hoc&quot; panels of inquest, various laws were passed, such as the &quot;lex Calpurnia de repetundis&quot; in 149 BC, which established a permanent court to try corruption cases; troubles with corruption and laws reacting to it continued through the republican era. By the end of the republic, a multitude of laws had been passed on how a governor would complete his task, requiring presence in the province, regulating how he could requisition goods from provincial communities, limiting the number of years he could serve in the province, etc.

==== Assignment ====

Prior to 123 BC, the senate assigned consular provinces as it wished, usually in its first meeting of the consular year. The specific provinces to be assigned were normally determined by lot or by mutual agreement among the commanders; only extraordinarily did the senate assign a command (outside of sortition). But in 123 or 122 BC, the tribune Gaius Sempronius Gracchus passed the &quot;lex Sempronia de provinciis consularibus&quot;, which required the senate to select the consular provinces before the consular elections and made this announcement immune from tribunician veto. The law had the effect of, over time, abolishing the temporary , as it was not always realistic for the senate to anticipate the theatres of war some six months in advance. Instead, the senate chose to assign consuls to permanent provinces near expected trouble spots. From 200 to 124 BC, only 22 per cent of recorded consular were permanent provinces; between 122 and 53 BC, this rose to 60 per cent.

While many of the provinces had been assigned to sitting praetors in the earlier part of the second century, with new praetorships created to fill empty provincial commands, by the start of the first century it had become uncommon for praetors to hold provincial commands during their formal annual term. Instead they generally took command as promagistrate after the end of their term. The use of prorogation was due to an insufficient number of praetors, which was for two reasons: more provinces needed commands and the increased number of permanent jury courts (&quot;quaestiones perpetuae&quot;), each of which had a praetor as president, exacerbated this issue. Praetors during the second century were normally prorogued &quot;pro praetore&quot;, but starting with the Spanish provinces and expanding by 167 BC, praetors were more commonly prorogued with the augmented rank &quot;pro consule&quot;; by the end of the republic, all governors acted &quot;pro consule&quot;.

Also important was the assertion of popular authority over the assignment of provincial commands. This started with Gaius Marius, who had an allied tribune introduce a law transferring to him the already-taken province of Numidia (then held by Quintus Caecilius Metellus), allowing Marius to assume command of the Jugurthine War. This innovation destabilised the system of assigning provincial commands, exacerbated internal political tensions, and later allowed ambitious politicians to assemble for themselves enormous commands which the senate would never have approved: the Pompeian &quot;lex Gabinia&quot; of 67 BC granted Pompey all land within 50 miles of the Mediterranean; Caesar&#x27;s Gallic command that encompassed three normal provinces.

=== Late Republican period ===
In the late Republican period, Roman authorities generally preferred that a majority of people in Rome&#x27;s provinces venerated, respected, and worshipped gods from Rome proper and Roman Italy to an extent, alongside normal services done in honor of their &quot;traditional&quot; gods.

==== Transition to empire ====
The increasing practices of prorogation and statutorily-defined &quot;super commands&quot; driven by political tactics undermined the republican constitutional principle of annually-elected magistracies. This allowed the powerful men to amass disproportionate wealth and military power through their provincial commands, which was one of the major factors in the transition from a republic to an imperial autocracy.

The senate attempted to push back against these commands in many instances: it preferred to break up any large war into multiple territorially separated commands; for similar reasons, it opposed the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot; which gave Pompey an overlapping command over large portions of the Mediterranean. The senate, which had long acted as a check on aristocratic ambitions, was unable to stop these immense commands, which culminated eventually with the reduction of the number of meaningfully-independent governors during the triumviral period to three men and, with the end of the republic, to one man.

=== Early imperial period ===

During his sixth and seventh consulships (28 and 27 BC), Augustus began a process which saw the republic return to &quot;normality&quot;: he shared the &quot;fasces&quot; that year with his consular colleague month-by-month and announced the abolition of the triumvirate by the end of the year in accordance with promises to do so at the close of the civil wars. At the start of 27 BC, Augustus formally had a provincial command over all of Rome&#x27;s provinces. That year, in his &quot;first settlement&quot;, he ostentatiously returned his control of them and their attached armies to the senate, likely by declaring that the task assigned to him either by the &quot;lex Titia&quot; creating the Triumvirate or that the war on Cleopatra and Antony was complete. In return, at a carefully-managed meeting of the senate, he was given commands over Spain, Gaul, Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Egypt to hold for ten years; these provinces contained 22 of the 28 extant Roman legions (over 80 per cent) and contained all prospective military theatres.

The provinces that were assigned to Augustus became known as imperial provinces and the remaining provinces, largely demilitarised and confined to the older republican conquests, became known as public or senatorial provinces, as their commanders were still assigned by the senate on an annual basis consistent with tradition. Because no one man could command in practically all the border-regions of the empire at once, Augustus appointed subordinate legates for each of the provinces with the title &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;. These lieutenant &quot;legati&quot; probably held &quot;imperium&quot; but, due to their lack of an independent command, were unable to triumph and could be replaced by their superior (Augustus) at any time. These arrangements were likely based on the precedent of Pompey&#x27;s proconsulship over the Spanish provinces after 55 BC entirely through legates, while he stayed in the vicinity of Rome. In contrast, the public provinces continued to be governed by proconsuls with formally independent commands. In only three of the public provinces were there any armies: Africa, Illyricum, and Macedonia; after Augustus&#x27; Balkan wars, only Africa retained a legion.

To make this monopolisation of military commands palatable, Augustus separated prestige from military importance and inverted it. The title &quot;pro praetore&quot; had gone out of use by the end of the republic and was regardless in inferior status to a proconsul. More radically, Egypt (which was sufficiently powerful that a commander there could start a rebellion against the emperor) was commanded by an equestrian prefect, &quot;a very low title indeed&quot; as prefects were normally low-ranking officers and equestrians were not normally part of the elite. In Augustus&#x27; &quot;second settlement&quot; of 23 BC, he gave up his continual holding of the consulship in exchange for a general proconsulship – with a special dispensation from the law that nullified &quot;imperium&quot; within the city of Rome – over the imperial provinces. He also gave himself, through the senate, a general grant of &quot;imperium maius&quot;, which gave him priority over the ordinary governors of the public provinces, allowing him to interfere in their affairs.

Within the public and imperial provinces there also existed distinctions of rank. In the public provinces, the provinces of Africa and Asia were given only to ex-consuls; ex-praetors received the others. The imperial provinces eventually produced a three-tier system with prefects and procurators, legates &quot;pro praetore&quot; who were ex-praetors, and legates &quot;pro praetore&quot; who were ex-consuls. The public provinces&#x27; governors normally served only one year; the imperial provinces&#x27; governors on the other hand normally served several years before rotating out. The extent to which the emperor exercised control over all the provinces increased during the imperial period: Tiberius, for example, once reprimanded legates in the imperial provinces for failing to forward financial reports to the senate; by the reign of Claudius, however, the senatorial provinces&#x27; proconsuls were regularly issued with orders directly from the emperor.

=== Late imperial period ===


The emperor Diocletian introduced a radical reform known as the &quot;tetrarchy&quot; (AD 284–305), with a western and an eastern senior emperor styled &quot;Augustus&quot;, each seconded by a junior emperor (and designated successor) styled &quot;caesar&quot;. Each of these four defended and administered a quarter of the empire. In the 290s, Diocletian divided the empire anew into almost a hundred provinces, including Roman Italy. Their governors were hierarchically ranked, from the proconsuls of Africa Proconsularis and Asia through those governed by &quot;consulares&quot; and &quot;correctores&quot; to the &quot;praesides&quot;. The provinces in turn were grouped into (originally twelve) dioceses, headed usually by a &quot;vicarius&quot;, who oversaw their affairs. Only the proconsuls and the urban prefect of Rome (and later Constantinople) were exempt from this, and were directly subordinated to the tetrarchs.

Although the Caesars were soon eliminated from the picture, the four administrative resorts were restored in 318 by Emperor Constantine I, in the form of praetorian prefectures, whose holders generally rotated frequently, as in the usual magistracies but without a colleague. Constantine also created a new capital, named after him as Constantinople, which was sometimes called &#x27;New Rome&#x27; because it became the permanent seat of the government. In Italy itself, Rome had not been the imperial residence for some time and 286 Diocletian formally moved the seat of government to Mediolanum (modern Milan), while taking up residence himself in Nicomedia. During the 4th century, the administrative structure was modified several times, including repeated experiments with Eastern-Western co-emperors. 
Detailed information on the arrangements during this period is contained in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (Record of Offices), a document dating from the early 5th century. Most data is drawn from this authentic imperial source, as the names of the areas governed and titles of the governors are given there. There are however debates about the source of some data recorded in the &#x27;, and it seems clear that some of its own sources are earlier than others. Some scholars compare this with the list of military territories under the &quot;duces&quot;, in charge of border garrisons on so-called &quot;limites&quot;, and the higher ranking &#x27;, with more mobile forces, and the later, even higher &quot;magistri militum&quot;.

Justinian I made the next changes in 534–536 by abolishing, in some provinces, the strict separation of civil and military authority that Diocletian had established. This process was continued on a larger scale with the creation of Exarchates in the 580s and culminated with the adoption of the military theme system in the 640s, which replaced the older administrative arrangements entirely. Some scholars use the reorganization of the empire into themata in this period as one of the demarcations between the Dominate and the Byzantine (or the Later Roman) period.

Cisalpine Gaul (in northern Italy) was occupied by Rome in the 220s BC and became considered geographically and &quot;de facto&quot; part of Roman Italy, but remained politically and &quot;de jure&quot; separated. It was legally merged into the administrative unit of Roman Italy in 42 BC by the triumvir Augustus as a ratification of Caesar&#x27;s unpublished acts (&quot;Acta Caesaris&quot;).

<text>Christopher Horne, also known by his stage name christ., is a Scottish musician. He disclaims any religious meaning in the stage name; he describes it as short for his full name, and the full stop or period as indicating that status as an abbreviation.

christ. performs as a solo electronic music artist, and his music is often likened to that of the (also Scottish) electronic group Boards of Canada. In fact, credited as &quot;Chris H.&quot;, he was an early participant in the nebulous Hexagon Sun collective from which Boards of Canada emerged, and was a collaborator with the group until approximately 1995. He appeared on the &quot;Twoism&quot; album as co-writer of the track &quot;Melissa Juice&quot;, reissued by Warp in 2002 (his credits were removed from the reissue at his own request). Horne&#x27;s departure was amicable and he thanks the duo on his &quot;Pylonesque EP&quot; issued on the Benbecula Records label in 2001. He followed this release with a full-length album &quot;Metamorphic Reproduction Miracle&quot; on the same label which was very well received within the genre.

christ. has toured the UK, Europe and Japan and performed a live session for John Peel at Maida Vale studios in London on 17 December 2003. This session became notable among Peel&#x27;s fans as being the only known occasion upon which the DJ requested an encore. He released his fourth full-length album, his second for Benbecula, on 22 January 2007 (after delays, due to manufacturing and marketing issues extending past the intended November 2006 date).

<text>Benbecula Records was a Scottish independent record label. Established in 1999 in Edinburgh, Scotland, by local musicians Phase 6 and Beluga, Benbecula Records began as a CD-R-based record label before moving towards large-run commercial vinyl record and CD releases in 2000.

The label closed on 1 November 2009.

==Biography==
Traditionally, Benbecula Records embodied the Scottish electronic music scene, releasing the works of local artists Christ., Clubbed to Death, Reverbaphon, Frog Pocket, Genaro and Operator. Later on, Benbecula Records increasingly represented artists from abroad, particularly Canadian musician Prhizzm, American free jazz artist Brian Ellis, German producer E.Stonji, and English musicians Birdengine, Ochre and Damien Shingleton.

==Minerals Series==
In the &quot;spirit of independent music making&quot;, Benbecula Records announced a new initiative in 2005 titled the &quot;minerals series&quot;. This series aimed at producing limited CD-R runs of albums and compilations which, though deemed notable by the label in some regard, were not commercially viable as full-scale releases. The first instalment of the minerals series was a 12-disc set of CD-Rs. Customers who purchased the full set received a bonus CD containing rare unreleased Christ. tracks, with the full package wrapped in a cloth band. Following the success of this initiative – the label sold out of the series during the pre-order phase – Benbecula Records continued producing CD-Rs as part of the minerals series as a complement to its range of commercial releases.

<doc id="314742" wikidata="Q927550" url="?curid=314742" title="Malcolm Turnbull">
<text>Malcolm Bligh Turnbull (born 24 October 1954) is an Australian former politician and businessman who served as the 29th prime minister of Australia from 2015 to 2018. He held office as leader of the Liberal Party of Australia and was the member of parliament (MP) for the New South Wales division of Wentworth from 2004 to 2018.

Turnbull graduated from the University of Sydney as a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws, before attending Brasenose College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar, earning a Bachelor of Civil Law degree. For more than two decades, he worked as a journalist, lawyer, merchant banker, and venture capitalist. He was Chair of the Australian Republican Movement from 1993 to 2000, and was one of the leaders of the unsuccessful &quot;Yes&quot; campaign in the 1999 republic referendum. He was first elected to the Australian House of Representatives as a member of parliament (MP) for the division of Wentworth in New South Wales at the 2004 election, and was Minister for the Environment and Water in the Howard government from January 2007 until December 2007.

After coming second in the 2007 leadership election, Turnbull won the leadership of the Liberal Party in a leadership spill the following year and became Leader of the Opposition. However, his support of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme proposed by the Rudd government in December 2009 led in turn to a leadership challenge by Tony Abbott, who defeated Turnbull by a single vote. Though initially planning to leave politics after this, Turnbull chose to remain and was later appointed Minister for Communications in the Abbott government following the Liberal-National Coalition&#x27;s victory at the 2013 election.

Two years later, citing consistently poor opinion polling, Turnbull resigned from the Cabinet on 14 September 2015 and challenged Abbott, successfully reclaiming the leadership of the Liberal Party by ten votes. He was sworn in as prime minister the following day. The Turnbull government initiated the National Innovation and Science Agenda as its key economic priority, working to promote STEM education, increase venture capital funding for new start-ups, and launch an &quot;ideas boom&quot;. Turnbull also pursued &quot;city deals&quot; with local and state governments to improve planning outcomes and encourage investment in major infrastructure projects such as the Western Sydney Airport. In 2016, Turnbull led the Coalition to a narrow victory in a double dissolution election. In his second term, Turnbull initiated and campaigned for the &quot;Yes&quot; side in the same-sex marriage plebiscite, which was ultimately successful. Turnbull also announced Snowy Hydro 2.0, a major expansion of the Snowy Mountains Scheme as a key component in enabling the transition to renewable energy. In late 2017, the government experienced a parliamentary eligibility crisis that saw fifteen parliamentarians forced out of Parliament due to concerns about dual citizenship.

To address climate change and reform energy policy, in August 2018 Turnbull proposed the National Energy Guarantee. Although initially agreed to by the Cabinet, the policy was ultimately rejected by the party room. This, combined with poor opinion polling, led to Peter Dutton challenging Turnbull for the Liberal leadership. Although Turnbull defeated Dutton in the party room, a majority of MPs demanded a second spill, which Turnbull did not contest. On 24 August 2018, Scott Morrison defeated Dutton and Julie Bishop in the contest, and replaced Turnbull as prime minister. Turnbull resigned from Parliament, triggering a by-election in his former seat of Wentworth. The Liberal Party lost the by-election to independent candidate Kerryn Phelps, which resulted in the Coalition losing its absolute majority in the House of Representatives.

Since retiring from politics, Turnbull has become an advisor to Kasada, an Australian cybersecurity start-up. He has been critical of the direction of the Liberal Party, and has joined with his former opponent Kevin Rudd in criticising the dominance of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp in Australian political debate.

==Early life and education==
Malcolm Bligh Turnbull was born in Sydney, on 24 October 1954, the only child of Bruce Bligh Turnbull and Coral Magnolia Lansbury. His father was a hotel broker, while his mother was a radio actor, writer, and academic, and a second cousin of the British film and television actress Angela Lansbury. His maternal grandmother, May Lansbury (&quot;née&quot; Morle), was born in England, while his other grandparents were Australian-born. He is also of Scottish descent; his great-great-great-grandfather John Turnbull (1751–1834) arrived on the &quot;Coromandel&quot; in 1802 in New South Wales and became a tailor. In an interview in 2015, Turnbull said that his middle name &quot;Bligh&quot; has been a family tradition for generations, originally given in honour of Governor William Bligh. Turnbull&#x27;s parents married in December 1955, fourteen months after his birth. The Turnbulls lived in a two-bedroom flat in Vaucluse, where Turnbull would attend the nearby public school. Bruce and Coral&#x27;s marriage was an unhappy one, and Turnbull wrote that the couple rarely slept or spent time together, only staying married due to himself. Coral frequently belittled her husband about his lack of education and that the fortunes of the family depended on her. Coral started spending increasing amounts of time with John Salmon, a professor of history at the University of New South Wales. When Turnbull was nine, Salmon received a teaching post in New Zealand, and Coral went with him, ending the marriage. Bruce told Turnbull that Coral was studying for another degree, which although Coral did get a PhD in New Zealand, was an effort by Bruce to hide the fact that Coral had left him. Turnbull was from then raised solely by his father. Turnbull suffered from asthma as a young child.

After spending his first three years of schooling at Vaucluse Public School, he started boarding at Sydney Grammar School in St Ives. Turnbull wrote that he hated boarding school, as he was bullied due to bed wetting. Bruce, now a single father, had troubles paying school fees, causing many letters to be sent to the Turnbull residence from the school bursar. These financial issues forced the Turnbulls to move from Vaucluse to a small flat in Double Bay, where they lived without much furniture. Turnbull then began to attend Grammar&#x27;s high school campus on College Street, on a partial scholarship. During this time he lived at the school&#x27;s former Randwick boarding facilities. Also during this time Bruce remarried, and his business continued to grow. The Turnbulls moved into a large apartment in Point Piper, and the pressure of the school fees was relieved. Although a mediocre mathematician, Turnbull excelled in Greek, English, and History, and joined the debating and drama clubs, where he won the Lawrence Campbell Oratory Competition and starred in numerous Shakespeare plays, respectively. He was made senior school co-captain in 1972, however, contrary to certain sources, Turnbull was not the dux of his graduating year at Sydney Grammar. In 1987, in memory of his late father, he set up the Bruce Turnbull means-tested scholarship at Sydney Grammar, offering full remission of fees to a student unable to afford them.

In 1973, Turnbull attended the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1977 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1978. Turnbull wrote for the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Honi Soit&quot;, writing largely about politics. Turnbull also visited former Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang, discussing 1920s and 1930s state politics. During his studies, he was involved in student politics, serving as board director of the University of Sydney Union and a member of the Students&#x27; Representative Council. He also worked part-time as a political journalist for &quot;Nation Review&quot;, Radio 2SM and Channel 9, covering state politics. Around this time, Turnbull would meet businessman Kerry Packer, for whom he would later do extensive legal work.

In 1978, Turnbull won a Rhodes Scholarship and attended Brasenose College, Oxford, where he briefly studied for a business degree before switching to a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law from 1978 to 1980, graduating with honours. While at Oxford, he worked for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and contributed to newspapers and magazines in both the United States and Australia. He befriended the future UK prime minister Theresa May, who credits Turnbull for encouraging her husband Philip May to propose to her. Turnbull also met his future wife, Lucy, during this time. During Turnbull&#x27;s time at Oxford, a university don wrote of him that he was &quot;always going to enter life&#x27;s rooms without knocking&quot;.

== Professional career ==

=== Costigan commission ===
After graduating from Oxford, Turnbull returned to Australia and began working as a barrister. He was general counsel and secretary for Australian Consolidated Press Holdings Group from 1983 to 1985. During this time, he defended Kerry Packer against the &quot;Goanna&quot; allegations made by the Costigan Commission, accusing Packer of the murder of bank manager Ian Coote, among other crimes. The Commission believed that Packer had committed the murder to hide other criminal activities. Turnbull attempted to use the press to goad the counsel assisting the commission, Douglas Meagher QC, into suing him and Packer for a 6000-word statement intentionally defamatory of Costigan and Meagher, accusing them of being &quot;unjust, capricious, dishonest and malicious&quot;. The statement worked, and it was printed in full in many newspapers, increasing public opinion of Packer. Turnbull later advised Packer to sue Meagher for defamation, an action that was struck down by Justice David Hunt as being an abuse of process, saying that Turnbull had managed &quot;to poison the fountain of justice&quot;. These tactics made Turnbull enemies within the NSW Bar Association, leading to Turnbull&#x27;s departure from that organisation. After the findings of the Costigan Commission were handed down, accusing Packer of tax evasion, drug trafficking and murder, Turnbull phoned Premier of Queensland Joh Bjelke-Petersen, requesting an inquest into the Commission&#x27;s findings. Bjelke-Petersen agreed to hold the inquest, which refuted the Costigan Commission&#x27;s allegations that Packer had committed murder.

=== &quot;Spycatcher&quot; trial ===
In partnership with Bruce McWilliam, he established his own law firm, Turnbull McWilliam. During 1986, Turnbull defended Peter Wright, a former MI5 official who wrote the book &quot;Spycatcher,&quot; detailing his work for the spy agency during the Cold War. The British government had obtained an injunction to stop the book&#x27;s sale, and wanted to do the same in Australia. Turnbull argued that the book had nothing new in it, that other books with never-before-seen confidential information had been allowed by the British government with minimal changes while wanting to restrict a different book, and that the government had lied to the court through the trial. The case was successful after going through the New South Wales Court of Appeal, stopping the British government&#x27;s attempts to suppress the book&#x27;s publication in Australia. The case was widely reported, making Turnbull a public figure in Australia and the United Kingdom, and causing the book to sell over 2 million copies in Australia. Turnbull later wrote a book on the trial, titled &quot;The Spycatcher Trial&quot;.

=== Other legal work ===
In 1987, Turnbull established an investment banking firm, Whitlam Turnbull &amp; Co Ltd, in partnership with Neville Wran, the former Labor Premier of New South Wales, and Nicholas Whitlam, the former Chief Executive of the State Bank of New South Wales and the son of former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Whitlam parted company with the firm in 1990; it operated as Turnbull &amp; Partners Ltd until 1997.

Turnbull left the firm he co-founded in 1997 to become a managing director of Goldman Sachs Australia, eventually becoming a partner in Goldman Sachs and Co. Additionally, he worked as a director of Star Technology Systems from 1993 to 1995. During this time Turnbull was also the chairman of Axiom Forest Resources, which conducted logging in the Solomon Islands under the trading name Silvania Forest Products. The latter&#x27;s work was described by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau as a &quot;clear-felling operation&quot;, and the then Solomon Islands Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni reportedly threatened to close it down for &quot;constant breaches of logging practices&quot;, according to a critical article in the &quot;Solomon Times&quot;.

Turnbull purchased a stake in the internet service provider OzEmail in 1994 for $500,000. He sold this stake several months before the dot com bubble burst in 1999 for $57 million to then-telecommunications giant MCI Worldcom. 

In May 2002, Turnbull appeared before the HIH Insurance royal commission to be questioned on Goldman Sachs&#x27;s involvement in the possible privatisation of one of the acquisitions of the collapsed insurance company. The Royal Commissioner&#x27;s report made no adverse findings against him or Goldman Sachs, however, Turnbull was one of nine defendants who settled later litigation over the collapse in undisclosed payments, thought to be worth as much as $500m.

==Early political involvement==
In 1981, Turnbull stood for Liberal Party preselection in the Division of Wentworth prior to the 1981 Wentworth by-election. He was defeated by Peter Coleman, who went on to win the seat. In 1982, following his retirement from politics, former prime minister William McMahon nominated Turnbull as his preferred successor in Lowe; the Liberals chose another candidate, and lost the by-election to Labor. Turnbull later attempted preselection in the safe state seat of Mosman in 1983, losing to Phillip Smiles. He let his membership of the Liberal Party lapse in 1986, before rejoining in 2000. Turnbull was made Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party in 2000, and was a member of the party&#x27;s federal and New South Wales executives from 2002 to 2003. He also spent time as a director of the Menzies Research Centre, the Liberal Party&#x27;s research centre.

=== Australian Republican Movement ===
In 1993, Turnbull was appointed by Prime Minister Paul Keating as Chair of the Republic Advisory Committee, charged with exploring ways of moving Australia to a republican form of government by replacing the Queen of Australia with an elected Australian head of state. Later that year, Turnbull became Chair of the Australian Republican Movement, a position he would hold until 2000. He was an elected delegate at the 1998 Australian Constitutional Convention in Canberra. At the convention, Turnbull cautioned against mixing the roles of president and prime minister, advocating a parliamentary republic, and supported the bi-partisan appointment republican model adopted by the convention.

Turnbull was an active campaigner in the unsuccessful 1999 referendum to establish an Australian republic, serving as Chair of the Yes Committee. He published a book on the campaign, titled &quot;Fighting for the Republic&quot;. When the referendum failed, he accused incumbent prime minister and monarchist John Howard of &quot;breaking the nation&#x27;s heart&quot;. Turnbull retired from the Australian Republican Movement in 2000, having already left the board of Ausflag in 1994; he joined the Australian National Flag Association in 2004.

===Choice of political party===
Turnbull has had a long affiliation with the Liberal Party of Australia throughout his career. During his time in the Australian Republican Movement however, he considered running for preselection for the Australian Labor Party. Turnbull&#x27;s mother was close friends with Premier of New South Wales Neville Wran and Senator Lionel Murphy, who had briefly dated her in university. Both men were members of the Labor Party. Turnbull himself was also friends with another Labor premier, Bob Carr. In 2015, it was revealed that Turnbull had held talks with Labor state politician John Della Bosca during the 1990s on a possible party switch, and that he had harboured aspirations in his youth to head the Australian Workers&#x27; Union, which is linked with the Labor Party. The accusation, made by former Labor Foreign Minister Bob Carr, was cited by Labor Leader Bill Shorten during the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.

==Howard government==
===Entry to parliament===

In 2000, Turnbull intended to seek Liberal preselection for Wentworth but did not eventually contest after concluding that preselection hopeful Peter King had the numbers in the branches. In 2003, Turnbull announced that he would challenge King for the seat and successfully defeated him to become the Liberal candidate. During what was a bitter preselection campaign, King accused Turnbull of branch stacking, by having local members transferring their membership to a branch that would decide the pre-selection, what King referred to as &quot;branch stripping&quot;.

Following his preselection loss, King stood against Turnbull at the 2004 federal election as an independent candidate. As a result, the traditionally safe Liberal seat became an electoral wildcard, the contest becoming a three-person race between Turnbull, King and the Labor candidate David Patch. During the campaign, Turnbull spent over 600,000 on his campaign. While the Liberal primary vote eventually fell by 10.3% to a total 41.8%, King received only 18% of the primary vote with a 57%/43% Liberal/Labor preference split which meant Turnbull was elected, albeit on a reduced 55.5% two-party vote after a 2.4% swing. The result meant that Wentworth was classified as a marginal seat for the first time since the 1993 federal election.

=== Cabinet Minister ===

Announcing a cabinet reshuffle on 24 January 2006, Prime Minister John Howard promoted Turnbull from the backbench to the role of parliamentary secretary, giving him special responsibility for water at the height of the 2000s Australian drought. On 26 September 2006, Howard announced the creation of a new Office of Water Resources, sitting within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to address the problem of drought in Australia; Turnbull was given responsibility for this office.

In January 2007, Howard promoted Turnbull to the Cabinet as Minister for the Environment and Water. In this position, Turnbull approved a proposed 1.7 billion Bell Bay Pulp Mill in north Tasmania, near Launceston. Turnbull&#x27;s approval of the Bell Bay Pulp Mill project of Gunns came on 4 October 2007 and followed a report by the government&#x27;s chief scientist Jim Peacock on the project&#x27;s potential environmental impact, which required the project to meet 48 &quot;strict environmental&quot; conditions.

In February 2007, Turnbull was criticised for claiming a government allowance of 175 a night and paying it to his wife as rent while living in a townhouse owned by her in Canberra.

During the 2007 federal election campaign, Turnbull announced that if re-elected the government would contribute 10 million to the investigation of an untried Russian technology that aims to trigger rainfall from the atmosphere, even when there are no clouds. The Australian Rain Corporation presented research documents written in Russian, explained by a Russian researcher who spoke to local experts in Russian. Although Turnbull claimed that the Australian Rain Corporation was Australian-based, investigations revealed that it was 75% Swiss-owned. It was also revealed that a prominent stakeholder in the Australian Rain Corporation, Matt Handbury, is a nephew of Rupert Murdoch. Turnbull refused to answer questions regarding Handbury&#x27;s contribution to the Wentworth Forum, the main fund-raising organisation for Turnbull&#x27;s 2007 election campaign.

== Opposition ==
===Aftermath of 2007 election===
Turnbull retained his seat at the 2007 federal election with a two-party vote 1.3% swing in Wentworth, despite a 5.6% swing away from the Coalition in the state, and a 5.4% swing against them nationwide. After John Howard lost his seat of Bennelong, on 25 November 2007 Peter Costello, who Howard stated publicly should succeed him, announced he would not seek the party leadership. Turnbull declared his candidacy later that same day, and was considered by the media as a favourite.

On 29 November he narrowly lost the leadership vote to Brendan Nelson by three votes; Nelson quickly appointed Turnbull Shadow Treasurer. Shortly after the vote, fellow Shadow Cabinet Minister Nick Minchin publicly suggested that Turnbull&#x27;s failure to consult with party colleagues before declaring his opinion to the media on issues such as an apology to the Stolen Generations was what had cost him the leadership. This led to a disagreement between the two and culminated in Minchin privately telling Turnbull that he was &quot;too fucking sensitive.&quot; In May 2008, Turnbull led the Coalition response to the 2008 Australian federal budget, criticising the increased taxes on luxury cars and certain alcoholic drinks, citing a possible increase in inflation as a concern.

===Leader of the Opposition (2008–2009)===

After months of consistently poor opinion polling, Turnbull challenged Brendan Nelson for the leadership on 16 September 2008. He won the ballot by four votes and became Leader of the Opposition. Later that month, Turnbull confessed that he had smoked marijuana in his younger days, becoming the first Liberal Leader to make such an admission. In early 2009, Turnbull appointed Chris Kenny, a former staffer to Alexander Downer and an &quot;Advertiser&quot; journalist, as his chief of staff. In May 2009, Turnbull attacked the 2009 Australian federal budget which came amidst the fallout from the global financial crisis.

In June 2009, Godwin Grech, a Treasury civil servant, privately contacted Turnbull, alleging that a car dealer with links to the Labor Party had received preferential treatment under the OzCar program, sparking the &#x27;OzCar affair&#x27;. Turnbull later repeated these allegations in Parliament, stating that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan had &quot;used their offices and taxpayers&#x27; resources to seek advantage for one of their mates and then lied about it to the Parliament&quot; and that they needed to &quot;either explain their actions or resign&quot;. On 22 June, the email Grech had secretly provided to Turnbull supporting allegation was alleged to have been faked by Grech. Grech subsequently admitted the forgery, with an Australian National Audit Office inquiry on 4 August clearing both Rudd and Swan of any wrongdoing. The resulting embarrassment of having repeated false allegations, as well as Turnbull&#x27;s demeanour throughout the OzCar affair, was judged as the cause of a subsequent significant decline in his approval ratings in opinion polls.

On 24 November 2009, Liberal and National MPs and Senators met to discuss the Rudd government&#x27;s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS). Turnbull announced that his policy would be to support the CPRS, despite significant disagreement among his colleagues. In response, Liberal MPs Wilson Tuckey and Dennis Jensen looked to move a leadership spill motion, intending to nominate Kevin Andrews as a challenger to Turnbull. While this attempt failed, increasing numbers of MPs and Senators publicly criticised the position, with several resigning from the Shadow Cabinet, including Tony Abbott.

On 1 December 2009, just one week after Turnbull announced the policy on the CPRS, Abbott announced he would challenge Turnbull for the leadership. Though initially regarded as having little chance of success, with Turnbull stating in public that Abbott did not have the numbers to win, Abbott defeated Turnbull in the ballot by a single vote. After the shock result, Turnbull returned to the backbench and said he would serve out the remainder of his term as Member for Wentworth. On 6 April 2010, he announced he would not seek re-election to the Australian Parliament. However, on 1 May 2010 he reversed this decision saying that he had been convinced by former prime minister John Howard to not give up his political career.

=== Shadow Minister (2010–2013) ===
At the 2010 federal election, Turnbull was re-elected with an 11.01% two-party swing towards him. After discussing the possibility of a return to the Shadow Cabinet with Tony Abbott, Turnbull was made Shadow Minister for Communications. In his first policy announcement in the role, Turnbull stated that a Coalition government would &quot;demolish&quot; the recently introduced National Broadband Network.

Delivering the 2012 Alfred Deakin Lecture on digital liberty, he spoke out strongly against the Gillard government&#x27;s proposed two-year data retention law. In July 2012, Turnbull was criticised by some Liberal MPs for saying that civil unions should be introduced as a first step towards establishing same-sex marriage in Australia. Tony Abbott rejected Turnbull&#x27;s suggestion of holding a conscience vote on the issue.

==Abbott government==
===Minister for Communications (2013–2015)===

On 9 April 2013, Turnbull and Tony Abbott presented their party&#x27;s alternative National Broadband Network (NBN) plan. The plan prioritised a modified and scaled-down NBN with &quot;fibre to the node&quot; (FTTN) and last-mile by copper cable. The new policy contrasted with the previous position which had called for the dismantling of the entire NBN.

After the Coalition victory in the 2013 federal election, Turnbull was appointed Minister for Communications and began implementing the alternative NBN strategy. In 2014, Turnbull announced that the Vertigan Report, a cost–benefit analysis of providing fast broadband to regional and rural Australia through wireless and satellite services, revealed that continuing the plan would cost nearly 5 billion and was expected to produce only 600 million in economic benefits – a return of just 10%. In spite of the economic cost, Turnbull stated that whilst subsidising broadband to regional areas is &quot;fiendishly expensive&quot;, there was no other option.

In December 2014, Turnbull brokered a deal between the Australian government, NBN Co and Telstra whereby NBN Co acquired Telstra&#x27;s copper network and hybrid-fibre coaxial (HFC) to deliver the NBN. Telstra and NBN Co agreed to work together on the FTTN trial involving 200,000 premises. In August 2015, Turnbull revealed that the overall end cost of the network build would likely expand up to an additional $15 billion, with NBN Co likely to take on the additional expenditure as debt. Though still cheaper than the original Labor Party NBN policy, which aimed to deliver much faster connection speeds, the peak funding requirement under the Liberal model ran to between $46 billion and $56 billion.

===February 2015 leadership spill motion===

Following persistent leadership tensions amidst poor opinion polling, a leadership spill motion was moved against Tony Abbott on 9 February 2015. Although the spill motion was defeated 61 votes to 39, Turnbull had been reported as considering a run for the leadership if the spill motion had succeeded. Before the motion Turnbull had told reporters that &quot;if, for whatever reason, the leadership of a political party is vacant then anyone, any member of the party can stand, whether they be a minister or a backbencher, without any disloyalty to the person whose leadership has been declared vacant.&quot;

== Prime Minister of Australia (2015–2018)==

===September 2015 leadership election===
Despite the defeat of the February 2015 spill motion, questions over Abbott&#x27;s leadership did not abate, with the government consistently performing poorly in opinion polls. On 14 September 2015, after 30 consecutive Newspolls had put the Liberals far behind Labor, Turnbull resigned from the Cabinet and announced he would challenge Abbott for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Turnbull stated that Abbott &quot;was not capable of providing the economic leadership we need&quot; and that the Liberal Party needs a &quot;style of leadership that respects the people&#x27;s intelligence.&quot; Turnbull defeated Abbott by 54 votes to 44 at the subsequent leadership ballot. He was sworn in as the 29th prime minister of Australia the following day.

Turnbull announced an extensive reshuffle of the Cabinet on 20 September 2015 to form the first Turnbull ministry. Notably, he increased the number of female Cabinet ministers from two to five and appointed Marise Payne as Australia&#x27;s first female Minister for Defence. The number of Cabinet ministers rose from 19 to 21. On Turnbull&#x27;s key policy differences with Abbott, particularly climate change, republicanism and same-sex marriage, he stated that there would be no immediate change before any election. The Nationals successfully negotiated a total of $4 billion worth of deals from Turnbull, as well as control of the water portfolio, in exchange for a continued Coalition agreement. Turnbull stated that he would not lead a government that did not take climate change seriously.

=== 2016 federal election ===
On 21 March 2016, Turnbull announced that Parliament would consider bills to reinstate the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC), with the bills having previously been rejected twice before. Turnbull stated if the Senate rejected the bills a third time, he would advise the governor-general, Sir Peter Cosgrove, to call a double dissolution of Parliament and a federal election for 2 July. Turnbull also brought forward the delivery of the federal budget from 10 to 3 May to facilitate this. On 18 April, the Senate once again rejected the bills to reinstate the ABCC. On 8 May, Turnbull visited Government House to advise Cosgrove to issue the writs for a double dissolution on 9 May; this confirmed the date of the election as 2 July 2016.

During the 2016 federal election campaign, a ReachTEL opinion poll of 626 Wentworth voters conducted on 31 May predicted a two-party swing against Turnbull for the first time since his election to Wentworth, revealing a reduced 58% two-party vote from a large 10.9% two-party swing. A controversy occurred during the election campaign, when the president of the Australian National Imams Council, Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman participated in an Iftar dinner hosted by Turnbull at Kirribilli House. Turnbull said he would not have invited Alsuleiman if he had known of his position regarding homosexuals.

At the election, the Coalition lost 14 seats and retained majority government by a single seat. The result was the closest since the 1961 federal election. In the days following the election, when the result was still not certain, Turnbull had to negotiate with the crossbench to secure confidence and supply support from Bob Katter, Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan in the event of a hung parliament and resulting minority government.

In February 2017, Turnbull confirmed he had donated $1.75 million to the Liberal Party&#x27;s election campaign.

===Asylum seeker policy===
Asylum seeker policy is a contentious wedge issue in Australian politics, especially since the Tampa affair. Continuing the bipartisan stance of Operation Sovereign Borders has been at the forefront the Coalition&#x27;s asylum seeker policy. Around 1,250 asylum seekers remain in the offshore processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru. In August 2016, protestors called for the closure of camps on Manus and Nauru after &quot;The Guardian&quot; released leaked incident reports alleging &quot;routine dysfunction and cruelty&quot; on Nauru.

In July 2016, the Obama administration set up a refugee centre in Costa Rica in response to a Central American migration crisis. In November, Turnbull and Peter Dutton announced that Australia would accept 1,250 refugees from Central America, in exchange for the U.S. accepting refugees on Nauru and Manus.

Turnbull and President Donald Trump held a phone conversation on 28 January 2017, the transcript of which was later leaked to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. On 2 February 2017, Trump tweeted that Obama&#x27;s deal was &quot;dumb&quot;. US Vice President Mike Pence later confirmed that the United States would honour the deal, subject to &quot;extreme vetting&quot; of asylum seekers. Australia began receiving Central American asylum seekers in July 2017.

===Energy policy===
Since the 2016 election, the Turnbull government had followed prior Coalition government energy policies. This involved the wholesale dismissal of renewable energy targets and emissions intensity schemes. This had only hardened when South Australia faced large blackouts, which Turnbull had blamed on the state&#x27;s &quot;ambitious&quot; renewable energy target. In response to the gas and energy crisis that occurred in March 2017, Malcolm Turnbull announced a 50% increase in the capacity of Snowy Hydro through &quot;pumped hydro&quot; technology.

In April 2017, Turnbull announced that he would use the Commonwealth government&#x27;s powers to place export restrictions on the nation&#x27;s liquified natural gas (&quot;LNG&quot;) industry. He announced that these changes were in response to the high wholesale gas prices that were a result of a shortage of gas in the domestic gas market, and that it was &quot;unacceptable&quot; that domestic prices were so high, indicating that a consequence of these restrictions would be a decrease in the wholesale gas price. The multinational gas companies and the gas industry association heavily criticised the policy, saying that it would neither increase supply nor reduce the wholesale price of gas.
===Same-sex marriage plebiscite===

Prior to Turnbull becoming prime minister, the parliamentary Liberal Party voted to resolve the issue of same-sex marriage by putting the question to Australian voters via a plebiscite. Enabling legislation was rejected twice by the Senate, and so the government decided to adopt a postal plebiscite option, which involved the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducting a nationwide survey asking voters whether they would like to see a change in the definition of marriage. Sending out of ballots began on 12 September 2017, as attempts to prevent the survey through a High Court challenge failed. The survey ended 7 November 2017 and results released 15 November the same year. It returned with a total of 7,817,247 (61.6%) &quot;Yes&quot; responses and 4,873,987 (38.4%) &quot;No&quot; responses.

Following the vote, after four days of debates regarding amendments which included proposals to increase religious protections to refuse services to same-sex couples, on 7 December 2017 same-sex marriage was legalised through a parliamentary vote by the House of Representatives; Turnbull himself voted &quot;Yes&quot;. The first same-sex marriages in Australia occurred as a result of the law change from 9 January 2018.

===Parliamentary eligibility crisis===
Members of Turnbull&#x27;s government were among those embroiled in the parliamentary eligibility crisis that arose in 2017, which disqualified several parliamentarians who held dual citizenship in accordance with subsection 44(i) of the Australian Constitution. Three Cabinet members were among the &quot;Citizenship Seven&quot; whose cases were heard in the High Court of Australia: the leader and deputy leader of the co-governing National Party, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, Senator Fiona Nash, and Resources Minister Matt Canavan, who resigned from Cabinet after discovering his potential dual citizenship. The High Court ruled that Canavan was eligible, but disqualified dual citizens Joyce and Nash from Parliament.

The Turnbull government temporarily lost its one-seat majority in the House of Representatives after Joyce&#x27;s disqualification and the resignation of Liberal Party MP John Alexander, who also held dual citizenship. However, in December 2017 both Joyce and Alexander, having renounced their foreign citizenships, contested and won by-elections in their former seats of New England and Bennelong respectively, thereby retaining Turnbull&#x27;s governing majority in the House of Representatives.

===August 2018 leadership spills===
On 21 August 2018, Turnbull survived a challenge to his leadership of the Liberal Party by Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, winning by 48 votes to 35. The spill highlighted ideological tensions within the Liberal Party, between the moderate wing led by Turnbull and the conservative wing represented by Dutton and Tony Abbott. From 21 to 23 August, tensions mounted and Dutton announced that he would seek a second spill. Turnbull responded that, pending a report from the Solicitor-General of Australia on the eligibility of Dutton to serve in Parliament and the receipt of a petition calling for a party room meeting that bore the signatures of at least half (43) of the parliamentary party, he would call such a meeting, vacate the leadership (regarding the petition as a vote of no confidence) and not stand in the subsequent leadership election. On the morning of 24 August, the Solicitor-General advised that Peter Dutton was &quot;not ineligible&quot; to serve. Later that morning, Dutton presented to Turnbull a document calling for a party room meeting that contained the minimum 43 signatures.
A party meeting was then called and the leadership was spilled, with Scott Morrison elected as Turnbull&#x27;s successor by 45 votes over Dutton with 40. In his final press conference as prime minister, Turnbull denounced Dutton and Abbott as &quot;wreckers&quot;.

On 27 August Turnbull announced that he would resign from Parliament over the coming days. On 31 August 2018 he tendered a formal notice of resignation to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

==Political ideology==
Coming from the moderate faction of the Liberal Party, Turnbull has been described as being pragmatic and holding a centrist ideology, with progressive and socially liberal views. An acolyte of former Prime Ministers Alfred Deakin and Robert Menzies, Turnbull said in a 2017 speech: &quot;In 1944 Menzies went to great pains not to call his new political party, consolidating the centre right of Australian politics, &quot;conservative&quot; – but rather the Liberal Party, which he firmly anchored in the centre of Australian politics.&quot; Later he added: &quot;The sensible centre, to use my predecessor Tony Abbott&#x27;s phrase, was the place to be and it remains the place to be now.&quot;

==Life after politics==
On 1 June 2019, Turnbull returned to the private sector as a senior advisor to major global private equity firm KKR. Turnbull returned to Australia in December 2019 and appeared on the final episode of &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; hosted by Tony Jones on 9 December 2019.

Turnbull publicly criticised the Morrison government for not taking strong enough action on climate change, arguing that they should readopt his National Energy Guarantee (NEG) policy. In a piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he stated that, &quot;Scott Morrison can&#x27;t afford to waste the bushfire crisis when Australia urgently needs its own Green New Deal...There are simply no more excuses. We cannot allow political prejudice and vested interests to hold us up any longer. If ever there was a crisis not to waste, it is this one. Morrison has the chance now to reinstate the NEG with higher targets. Both he and Josh Frydenberg were among its strongest supporters when I was PM. They abandoned it in the lead-up to an election, to pacify the right wing of the Coalition that sabotaged it in the first place.&quot;

On 25 October 2020, Turnbull gave his support to former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s petition for a &quot;Royal Commission to ensure a strong, diverse Australian news media&quot; with the goal of investigating Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s control over Australian news media, tweeting that he had signed it and encouraging others to follow suit. The petition became the most signed parliamentary e-petition in Australia, with more than 500,000 signatures. The petition was tabled in the House of Representatives by Labor MP Andrew Leigh on 9 November 2020.

In January 2021, Turnbull joined the board of the International Hydropower Association as a non-executive member, also becoming a co-chair of the organisation&#x27;s International Forum on Pumped Storage Hydropower.

In 2023, Turnbull gave a speech at the Centre for Asia Pacific Resilience and Innovation, at the organisation&#x27;s annual forum in Taipei, Taiwan. In the speech, he stated that Taiwan was under a greater threat from local actors who spread lies than external forces, seemingly hinting at recent issues involving China.

==Personal life==

Turnbull is married to Lucy Turnbull (), who was the Lord Mayor of Sydney from 2003 to 2004 and has held a number of other prominent positions. The couple were married on 22 March 1980 at Cumnor, Oxfordshire, by a Church of England priest while Turnbull was attending the University of Oxford. They live in the eastern suburbs of Sydney.

Turnbull and Lucy have two adult children, Alex and Daisy, and , three grandchildren. Alex Turnbull is married to Yvonne Wang, who is of Chinese descent.

The use of Bligh as a male middle name is a tradition in the Turnbull family. It is also Turnbull&#x27;s son&#x27;s middle name. One of Turnbull&#x27;s ancestors was colonist John Turnbull, who named his youngest son William Bligh Turnbull in honour of deposed Governor William Bligh at the time of the Rum Rebellion.

In 2008, Turnbull became the first Liberal leader to have admitted to smoking cannabis.

===Religion===
Raised Presbyterian, Turnbull became agnostic in the beginning of his adult life and later converted to Roman Catholicism &quot;by mid-2002&quot;; his wife&#x27;s family is Roman Catholic. However, he has found himself at odds with the church&#x27;s teaching on abortion, stem cell research and same-sex marriage. Turnbull supported legislation relaxing restrictions on abortion pill RU486, and he also voted for the legalisation of somatic cell nuclear transfer. He did so despite vocal opposition to both proposals by Cardinal George Pell, the then-Archbishop of Sydney.

=== Personal wealth ===
In 2005, the combined net worth of Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull was estimated at 133 million, making him Australia&#x27;s richest parliamentarian until the election of billionaire Clive Palmer in the 2013 election.

Turnbull made the &quot;BRW Rich 200&quot; list for the second year running in 2010, and although he slipped from 182 to 197, his estimated net worth increased to 186 million, and he continued to be the only sitting politician to make the list. Turnbull was not listed in the 2014 list of the &quot;BRW Rich 200&quot;. As of 2015, his estimated net worth is in excess of 200 million.

== Honours ==
On 1 January 2001, Turnbull received the Centenary Medal for services to the corporate sector. In the 2021 Australia Day Honours, he was awarded Companion of the Order of Australia for &quot;eminent service to the people and Parliament of Australia, particularly as Prime Minister, through significant contributions to national security, free trade, the environment and clean energy, innovation, economic reform and marriage equality, and to business and philanthropy&quot;.

<doc id="314743" wikidata="Q1553014" url="?curid=314743" title="Hume's principle">
<text>Hume&#x27;s principle or HP says that, given two collections of objects formula_1 and formula_2 with properties formula_3 and formula_4 respectively, the number of objects with property formula_3 is equal to the number of objects with property formula_4 if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) between formula_1 and formula_8. In other words, that bijections are the &quot;correct&quot; way of measuring size.

HP can be stated formally in systems of second-order logic. It is named for the Scottish philosopher David Hume and was coined by George Boolos. The principle plays a central role in Gottlob Frege&#x27;s philosophy of mathematics. Frege shows that HP and suitable definitions of arithmetical notions entail all axioms of what we now call second-order arithmetic. This result is known as Frege&#x27;s theorem, which is the foundation for a philosophy of mathematics known as neo-logicism.

== Origins ==

Hume&#x27;s Principle appears in Frege&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of Arithmetic&quot; (§63), which quotes from Part III of Book I of David Hume&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; (1740).

In the treatise, Hume sets out seven fundamental relations between ideas, in particular concerning &quot;proportion&quot; in quantity or number. He argues that our reasoning about proportion in quantity, as represented by geometry, can never achieve &quot;perfect precision and exactness&quot;, since its principles are derived from sense-appearance. He contrasts this with reasoning about number or arithmetic, in which such a precision &quot;can&quot; be attained:

Algebra and arithmetic [are] the only sciences in which we can carry on a chain of reasoning to any degree of intricacy, and yet preserve a perfect exactness and certainty. We are possessed of a precise standard, by which we can judge of the equality and proportion of numbers; and according as they correspond or not to that standard, we determine their relations, without any possibility of error. &quot;When two numbers are so combined, as that the one has always a unit answering to every unit of the other, we pronounce them equal&quot;; and it is for want of such a standard of equality in [spatial] extension, that geometry can scarce be esteemed a perfect and infallible science. (I. III. I.)
Note Hume&#x27;s use of the word &quot;number&quot; in the ancient sense to mean a set or collection of things rather than the common modern notion of &quot;positive integer&quot;. The ancient Greek notion of number (&quot;arithmos&quot;) is of a finite plurality composed of units. See Aristotle, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, 1020a14 and Euclid, &quot;Elements&quot;, Book VII, Definition 1 and 2. The contrast between the old and modern conception of number is discussed in detail in Mayberry (2000).

== Influence on set theory ==
The principle that cardinal number was to be characterized in terms of one-to-one correspondence had previously been used by Georg Cantor, whose writings Frege knew. The suggestion has therefore been made that Hume&#x27;s principle ought better be called &quot;Cantor&#x27;s Principle&quot; or &quot;The Hume-Cantor Principle&quot;. But Frege criticized Cantor on the ground that Cantor defines cardinal numbers in terms of ordinal numbers, whereas Frege wanted to give a characterization of cardinals that was independent of the ordinals. Cantor&#x27;s point of view, however, is the one embedded in contemporary theories of transfinite numbers, as developed in axiomatic set theory.

<text>The Amami woodcock (Scolopax mira) is a medium-sized wader. It is slightly larger and longer-legged than the Eurasian woodcock, and may be conspecific.

This species is a restricted-range endemic found only in forests on Amami Oshima, Okinawa and Tokunoshima. 
Consequently, due to the introduction of the invasive small Indian mongoose, their population is declining. Insofar as its habits are known, they are similar to the Eurasian woodcock.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The Amami woodcock was originally described as a subspecies of the Eurasian woodcock, due to a juvenile that resembled the Eurasian woodcock in coloration. Later, some argued that the Amami woodcock was a distinct species—Kobayashi in 1979 and Cramp &amp; Simmons in 1983. Comparison between the two species revealed their distinct physical features, and led to the emergence of the Amami woodcock as a distinct species.

<text>WSR-74 radars were Weather Surveillance Radars designed in 1974 for the National Weather Service. They were added to the existing network of the WSR-57 model to improve forecasts and severe weather warnings. Some have been sold to other countries like Australia, Greece, and Pakistan.

== Radar properties ==

There are two types in the WSR-74 series, which are almost identical except for operating frequency. The WSR-74C (used for local warnings) operates in the C band, and the WSR-74S (used in the national network) operates in the S band (like the WSR-57 and the current WSR-88D). S band frequencies are better suited because they are not attenuated significantly in heavy rain while the C Band is strongly attenuated, and has a generally shorter maximum effective range.

The WSR-74C uses a wavelength of 5.4 cm. It also has a dish diameter of 8 feet, and a maximum range of 579 km (313 nm) as it was used only for reflectivities (see Doppler dilemma).

== History ==

The WSR-57 network was very spread out, with 66 radars to cover the entire country. There was little to no overlap in case one of these vacuum-tube radars went down for maintenance. The WSR-74 was introduced as a &quot;gap filler&quot;, as well as an updated radar that, among other things, was transistor-based. In the early 1970s, Enterprise Electronics Corporation (EEC), based out of Enterprise, Alabama won the contract to design, manufacture, test, and deliver the entire WSR-74 radar network (both C and S-Band versions).

WSR-74C radars were generally local-use radars that didn&#x27;t operate unless severe weather was expected, while WSR-74S radars were generally used to replace WSR-57 radars in the national weather surveillance network. When a network radar went down, a nearby local radar might have to supply updates like a network radar. NWS Lubbock received the first WSR-74C in August 1973 following widespread attention from the F5 Lubbock tornado of 1970.

128 of the WSR-57 and WSR-74 model radars were spread across the country as the National Weather Service&#x27;s radar network until the 1990s. They were gradually replaced by the WSR-88D model (Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler), constituting the NEXRAD network. The WSR-74 had served the NWS for two decades.

The last WSR-74C used by the NWS was located in Williston, ND, before being decommissioned at the end of 2012.

No WSR-74S&#x27;s are in the NWS inventory today, having been replaced by the WSR-88D, but some of these radars are in commercial use.

WSR-74 sites include the following two categories:

<text>WSR-57 radars were the primary weather surveillance radar used by the United States for over 35 years. The National Weather Service operated a network of this model radar across the country, watching for severe weather. 

==History==

The WSR-57 (Weather Surveillance Radar - 1957) was the first &#x27;modern&#x27; weather radar. Initially commissioned at the Miami Hurricane Forecast Center, the WSR-57 was installed in other parts of the Contiguous United States (CONUS). The WSR-57 was the first generation of radars designed expressly for a national warning network.

The WSR-57 was designed in 1957 by Dewey Soltow using World War II technology, using modified versions of those used by United States Navy aircraft. In accordance with the Joint Electronics Type Designation System, it was designated AN/FPS-41, as the 41st design of an Army-Navy fixed radar(pulsed) electronic device for searching. It provided only coarse reflectivity data and no velocity data, which made it extremely difficult to predict tornadoes. Weather systems were traced across the radar screen using grease pencils. Forecasters had to manually turn a crank to adjust the radar&#x27;s scan elevation, and needed considerable skill to judge the intensity of storms based on green blotches on the radar scope.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has pictures of the Charleston, SC, WSR-57 radar image of the 1989 Hurricane Hugo. A WSR-57 dish, located on the roof of the National Hurricane Center (NHC), was blown away by Hurricane Andrew. The NHC report on Hurricane Andrew shows its last radar image, as well as images from nearby WSR-88D radars. 

As the network of WSR-57 radars aged, some were replaced with WSR-74S models of similar performance but with better reliability. WSR-57 operators sometimes had to scramble for spare parts no longer manufactured in this country. 128 of the WSR-57 and WSR-74 model radars were spread across the country as the National Weather Service&#x27;s radar network until the 1990s. The WSR-57 radars were gradually replaced by the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler, WSR-88D, which NOAA named the NEXRAD network. The last WSR-57 radar in the United States was decommissioned on December 2, 1996.

<text>The Moluccan woodcock (Scolopax rochussenii), also known as the Obi woodcock, is a lowland wader endemic to Indonesia. Its distribution is restricted to Obi and possibly Bacan, two small islands in North Maluku. It is a medium-sized bird, measuring 32-40 centimetres, and is the largest of the woodcocks. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to severe habitat destruction on Obi.

== Description ==
The Moluccan woodcock measures 32-40 centimetres in length. Its body shape is stocky and compact, with a rounded, robust chest, wide pointed wings, and a short tail. The bill is long, straight, and dark. The upperside of the bird is black with light tan spots and sparse barring, while the underside is unstreaked and yellow-orange with slight black mottling. It has black bands between the eye and bill and on the back of the neck.

The Moluccan woodcock is larger than other members of the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot;&quot;. S. rochusseni&quot; resembles &quot;S. celebensis&quot; (Sulawesi woodcock) but is larger, lighter, and more spotted. Despite their similar appearance, it is unlikely that the range of &quot;S. rochusseni&quot; and &quot;S. celebensis&quot; would overlap.

== Taxonomy ==
The Moluccan woodcock is part of the sandpiper family Scolopacidae. Of the 15 genera in the sandpiper family, the Moluccan woodcock belongs to &quot;Scolopax&quot;, the woodcock genus. &quot;Scolopax&quot; includes eight species of woodcock, six of which are localized island endemic species, including the Moluccan woodcock. Within the Scolopacidae family, woodcocks are most closely related to snipes.

A Moluccan woodcock was collected for the first time in 1862 by Heinrich Bernstein and the species was later named &quot;Scolopax rochussenii&quot; in 1866 by Hermann Schlegel.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The Moluccan woodcock is a lowland species that prefers wet, coastal habitats in or close to forests. Their presence is closely associated with rivers and streams, and they occupy the same habitats year-round. Initially, the Moluccan woodcock was believed to be a montane bird, a habitat preference that would explain the lack of observations of the species. However, despite its occasional use of montane habitat, it is now considered more characteristic of lowland environments. Moluccan woodcocks fly anywhere between 15 and 1150 meters in elevation, but their population density is higher at lower altitudes. The species is tolerant of minor habitat destruction and has been found to occupy secondary forests affected by selective logging and small-scale agriculture. The estimated territory size for the Moluccan woodcock is 10.67 hectares.

Moluccan woodcocks are endemic to Indonesia. They have been found on Obi and Bacan, two small islands in the north of the Moluccas, an archipelago in eastern Indonesia. It is estimated that there are 9530 Moluccan woodcock territories on Obi. Only one individual has been recorded on Bacan in 1902, with most knowledge of the species coming from observations on Obi. It is unknown whether the species is still present on the island of Bacan.

== Behaviour ==

=== Display flights ===
Moluccan woodcocks are usually only ever observed during display behaviour. The purpose of this behaviour in the Moluccan woodcock is unclear, and very little is known about the species&#x27; behaviour when it is not performing a display flight. Display behaviour occurs during dusk or dawn during the wet season from March until August. It consists of rapid and shallow wingbeats with loud vocalizations, with no obvious flight pattern. The bird follows a river or stream, or circles over a swamp, maintaining an altitude of approximately 10 meters over the canopy.

=== Territorial conflicts ===
Moluccan woodcocks occasionally engage in territorial conflicts while performing a display flight. These encounters occur when two birds meet one another while participating in display behaviour. The conflict consists of a short flight where both individuals fly parallel to one another and do not overlap into the other&#x27;s space. The birds communicate with a descending, twittering vocalization throughout the encounter.

=== Vocalizations ===
The Moluccan woodcock&#x27;s vocalizations are described as hard, explosive, metallic rattles, transcribed as &quot;ti’ti’ti’ti’ti’ti’ti’ti&quot;. Each trill lasts 0.1-0.6 seconds long and occur at intervals of 1.9-3.2 seconds. One trill contains 8-11 motifs, with each motif between 0.04 and 0.05 seconds long. The vocalizations are only known to occur during display flights.

== Documented sightings ==
A Moluccan woodcock was collected for the first time in 1862 by Heinrich Bernstein. From 1862 to 1982, only eight Moluccan woodcocks were recorded. Of these eight birds, seven were found on Obi and one was found on Bacan in 1902. From 1982 to 2013, there were no recordings of the Moluccan woodcock. The species seemingly disappeared until 2013 when a group of researchers rediscovered the bird and recorded its vocalizations for the first time. Today, the Moluccan woodcock is still not well understood and is considered to be an enigmatic species. Obi residents have limited knowledge of this bird and are unlikely to recognize it. Locals do not hunt or eat the species and therefore rarely have the opportunity to see Moluccan woodcocks up close.

== Threats and conservation status ==
The Moluccan woodcock is designated as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. While the species is tolerant of minor habitat destruction caused by selective logging and small-scale agriculture, the Moluccan woodcock still faces serious threats to its conservation. Severe habitat destruction caused by logging and mining activities on Obi is the major risk to the species&#x27; conservation, causing an overall decrease in population size. Unregulated large-scale nickel mining has led to the removal of all native vegetation and topsoil in some regions of western and southern Obi, causing dramatic modifications to the landscape and local bird populations. Moluccan woodcocks are not known to be hunted or trapped by locals on Obi.

The Moluccan woodcock was considered to be endangered from the years 2000 to 2021. In 2021, the species&#x27; designation was changed to vulnerable after having found that the species is more widespread on Obi than initially thought.

Conservation recommendations for the Moluccan woodcock include stricter mining regulations, the protection of lowland forests and rivers, and the establishment of a watershed management plan on Obi. Larger-scale sampling surveys are essential to better understand the distribution and population trend of the species and to better inform conservation management decisions.

<text>Villers-Cotterêts () is a commune in the Aisne department in Hauts-de-France, France. It is notable as the signing-place in 1539 of the &quot;Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts&quot; discontinuing the use of Latin in official French documents, and as the birthplace in 1802 of French novelist Alexandre Dumas &quot; père&quot;.

==Geography==
It is located NE of Paris via the RN2 facing Laon. Its nickname &quot;Petite villa sur la côte de Retz&quot; means &quot;Little villa by the coast of Retz&quot;, as the town is situated next to the Forest of Retz, which covers of land.

==History==
Villers-Cotterêts is famous in French law because of the &quot;Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts&quot; of 1539 signed by king Francis I of France (&#x27;François Ier&#x27;), which made French the official language in the kingdom instead of regional languages like Occitan or the elite European lingua franca of the time, Latin.

In 1914, the British Expeditionary Force fought a rearguard action here during the Retreat from Mons. On 1 September, the British 4th (Guards) Brigade who were covering the withdrawal of 2nd Division, came into contact with the leading units of the German III Corps on the edge of woodland near Villers-Cotterêts. The brigade lost more than 300 men in the encounter, but were able to break away and continue the withdrawal. Many are buried at Guards&#x27; Grave, a military cemetery maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. An ancillary hospital to that of Royaumont was set up in the town and a silent documentary about it was made.

La Plaine Saint-Rémy, Pisseleux, was an ancient commune that was merged with Villers-Cotterêts in 1971.

==Population==

The inhabitants are called &quot;Cottevreziens&quot; in French.
==Notable residents==
* Charles Baur (1929–2015), Mayor of Villers-Cotterêts (1953–1989), President of the Regional Council of Picardy (1976–1978, 1985–2004)

==Sports==
The town was the start of Stage 4 in the 2007 Tour de France.

==Sights==
The original château was built around 950 AD and was burnt to the ground twice before being rebuilt out of stone in the early 12th century. The front entrance is the only original remaining structure, which is listed with the Historic Monument Registry at the École des Beaux Arts. Francis I purchased the château from the de Noüe family to house his mistress Anne de Pisseleu d&#x27;Heilly. The was updated with 18th-century régence decoration by Gilles-Marie Oppenordt. The current owner is the Pépinières du Valois, an agricultural venture.

In 1902 the city opened a Museum Alexandre Dumas to gather souvenirs about the family. In 1952 the museum moved to a local 19th century mansion that served as General Maunoury&#x27;s headquarters during the First World War. It has three rooms, each of them dedicated to one of the family members, being the general Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, his son novelist Alexandre Dumas &quot;père&quot; and grandson novelist/playwright Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;.

<doc id="314768" wikidata="Q15527343" url="?curid=314768" title="Mary Gaudron">
<text>Mary Genevieve Gaudron (born 5 January 1943) is an Australian lawyer and judge, who was the first female Justice of the High Court of Australia. She was the Solicitor-General of New South Wales from 1981 until 1987 before her appointment to the High Court. After her retirement in 2002, she joined the International Labour Organization, serving as the President of its Administrative Tribunal from 2011 until 2014.

==Early life==
Gaudron was born in Moree, in northern rural New South Wales in 1943, the daughter of working-class parents Edward and Grace Gaudron. She would later speak about the intense racism towards Indigenous Australians which was part of everyday life in Moree and how it influenced her strong opposition to all forms of discrimination.

In 1951, H. V. Evatt passed through Moree to campaign for the &quot;no&quot; case in the 1951 referendum, at which the Menzies Liberal government was attempting to alter the Constitution of Australia in order to ban the Australian Communist Party. Evatt was addressing a small crowd from the back of a blue Holden ute, discussing the upcoming referendum and the Constitution, and Gaudron, not knowing what Evatt was referring to, asked &quot;Please sir, what&#x27;s a Constitution?&quot; Evatt explained that it was &quot;the laws by which Parliaments were governed.&quot; Gaudron asked whether it was similar to the Ten Commandments and Evatt replied that &quot;you could call it the Ten Commandments of government.&quot; Gaudron then asked for a copy and Evatt subsequently sent her one in the mail. Gaudron, expecting two stone tablets, was disappointed to receive only a small pamphlet. However, when the school bullies declared the pamphlet useless, Gaudron retorted that it was of great use to lawyers, and that some day she would be one.

==Education==
Gaudron was educated at St Ursula&#x27;s College in Armidale. In 1960 Gaudron was awarded a federal government scholarship to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Sydney, which she graduated with in 1962. In 1961 she also commenced a part-time Bachelor of Laws degree, graduating in 1965 with first-class honours and the University&#x27;s Medal for Law. Gaudron was the second female recipient, after Elizabeth Evatt, and the first female part-time student to be awarded the medal.

While studying, Gaudron attempted to obtain articles of clerkship (then five years in duration), but was not successful. She later said, &quot;Many distinguished lawyers took a lot of trouble and effort to explain to me that it was not their policy to take on women as articled clerks.&quot;

Instead, she took a job with the Australian Public Service, although, in accordance with the then regulations, she was required to relinquish her employment when she married. In 1988, Gaudron was awarded an honorary doctorate in law from Macquarie University, and another from the University of Sydney in 1999.

==Career==

===Barrister===
Gaudron was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in October 1968 after having completed her articles of clerkship and commenced practice as a barrister. She attempted to buy a room for herself in one of the barristers&#x27; chambers in Sydney but was regularly knocked back because she was a woman. When future High Court colleague Michael McHugh attempted to sell his room, the other members of his chambers would not let Gaudron buy it, although there were no other buyers. She eventually shared a room with Janet Coombs, another pioneering female barrister. Gaudron regularly argued before the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court in the early 1970s, particularly in the area of industrial law. In 1972 she became the first woman to be appointed to the Council of the New South Wales Bar.

Gaudron&#x27;s first major breakthrough was in 1970 with &quot;O&#x27;Shaughnessy v Mirror Newspapers Ltd&quot;, where as a 27-year-old junior counsel she successfully argued the matter single-handedly before the High Court after the plaintiff, Peter O&#x27;Shaughnessy, sacked his senior counsel, Clive Evatt QC, preferring her ability over the veteran. According to O&#x27;Shaughnessy, &#x27;she cut a valiant figure, this &quot;slip of a girl&quot;, who stood unsupported before the five legal elders of the land. They were obviously impressed by her courage, her sheer elegant dash, her shining intellect finding expression in felicitous language, her good manners, charm, poise. And perhaps, when all is said and done, by her sheer cheek in taking on the case.&#x27;

Another one of Gaudron&#x27;s significant cases was in 1972, when she successfully argued the Equal Pay case for the Whitlam Labor government before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

Early in 1972, Gaudron had entered a bar with a male barrister friend when the waitress informed the friend that the bar did not serve women. Gaudron &quot;patiently explained to the barmaid that my friend didn&#x27;t want a woman because he&#x27;d brought his own,&quot; eventually creating &quot;something of a scene&quot; which attracted the attention of Labor politician Clyde Cameron, who said that he didn&#x27;t realise such sexual discrimination still existed. Gaudron said that &quot;the discrimination being practised in that particular hotel was nothing compared to the discrimination over which he would undoubtedly preside when he became Minister for Industrial Relations after the next election.&quot; However, the Whitlam government was elected on 2 December, and Cameron duly became Minister for Industrial Relations. Whitlam called Gaudron on 3 December to hire her to argue the case for equal pay.

The case, begun by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and supported by the Whitlam government, extended the reach of the original but limited equal pay decision of 1969. Prior decisions had guaranteed equal pay only for certain specific occupations and later, certain limited industries (industries traditionally considered &#x27;women&#x27;s work&#x27;, such as the textile industry), whereas this case extended the principle of equal pay to all workers. Gaudron&#x27;s argument was based on the principles of the 1951 Equal Remuneration Convention of the International Labour Organization (an organisation she would later work for). However, Gaudron later came to regard her argument, that Australia had not ratified the Convention because the commission would not grant equal pay (thus preventing Australia from fulfilling its obligations under the convention), as somewhat disingenuous, and recalled it with a measure of embarrassment.

===Conciliation and Arbitration Commission===
In April 1974, Gaudron was appointed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as Deputy President, becoming the youngest ever federal judge. It was rumoured that Cameron had advocated in Cabinet for her appointment, first by emphasising her outstanding academic record, then by noting her humble working-class background, to which Whitlam supposedly said, &quot;Next you&#x27;ll be telling us she was born in a bloody manger!&quot;

Gaudron&#x27;s most notable case on the Arbitration Commission was an important test case for maternity leave in 1979, which laid down award standards allowing for a year&#x27;s unpaid leave for all full-time and permanent part-time workers. In 1979–1980, Gaudron was the inaugural chair of the NSW Legal Services Commission. Gaudron held the position of Deputy President until her resignation in May 1980.

===Lecturer, QC and Solicitor-General===
Gaudron lectured at the University of New South Wales&#x27; law school for a brief time, then in February 1981 she was appointed the Solicitor-General of New South Wales, the first female Solicitor-General in any Australian jurisdiction. That same year, she was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC), the first female QC in New South Wales. In her capacity as Solicitor-General, Gaudron argued for New South Wales in such landmark High Court cases as the Tasmanian Dams case. From 1981 to 1986, she served on the Council of Macquarie University, and from 1984 to 1986, chaired an advisory council at the University of Wollongong.

===High Court Justice===
The death of Justice Lionel Murphy in October 1986 and the retirement of Chief Justice Harry Gibbs in February 1987 created two vacancies on the High Court. On 6 February 1987, John Toohey and Gaudron were appointed to the court. At just 44 years of age, Gaudron was the fourth youngest Justice, after Evatt, McTiernan and Dixon, as well as the first female Justice.

As a High Court Justice, Gaudron contributed to every area of Australian law, most notably to Australian criminal law, in judgments that &quot;combine technical mastery with a general tendency to insist on strict compliance by trial judges with their obligations in directing juries&quot;. Gaudron was part of the progressive Mason and Brennan courts, which decided such influential cases as &quot;Cole v Whitfield&quot;, &quot;Dietrich v The Queen&quot;, and the Mabo case. Gaudron was consistently opposed to all forms of discrimination, with notable judgments in this vein including the decision in &quot;Street v Queensland Bar Association&quot; (on Section 117 of the Constitution of Australia) and her joint judgment with Justice McHugh in &quot;Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia&quot;.

Gaudron was generally regarded as not particularly emotive in her writing style, although the judgment for which she is perhaps best remembered popularly was the Mabo case, where, in a joint judgment with Justice Deane, she said that Australia&#x27;s past treatment of Indigenous Australians was &quot;the darkest aspect of the history of this nation&quot;.

The award of Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) was made to six of the seven serving High Court justices in the Bicentennial Australia Day Honours of 1988. Gaudron had declined the award without explanation.

On 19 September 1997 Gaudron was appointed the founding Patron of Australian Women Lawyers and continued in this role until 20 February 2009.

===Retirement===
On 21 June 2002, Gaudron announced her retirement from the High Court, effective from 10 February 2003. She left the court at the age of just 60, ten years before she reached the mandatory retirement age. Gaudron&#x27;s early retirement was lamented by all areas of the legal profession. Justice Michael Kirby, who was a close friend of Gaudron, has stated many times that her absence left the court with a different character and turned it into &quot;a more blokey place&quot;.

In March 2003, Gaudron joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2004 she was a member of an inquiry into trade union rights in Belarus. She was also appointed as a judge of the ILO&#x27;s Administrative Tribunal. From July 2011, she has been appointed as President of the Tribunal.

==Criticism==
Gaudron has occasionally been criticised throughout her career. At the time of her appointment to the High Court in 1987, the New South Wales legal magazine &quot;Justinian&quot; published anonymous remarks stating &quot;a melancholy catalogue of sins of omission and commission as well as the better claims of others&quot; ought to have weighed against her appointment, and that she held &quot;an emotional disposition inappropriate in a holder of judicial office&quot;. Jack Waterford in &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; observed that her appointment would likely be controversial as she was &quot;strongly identified with the Labor Party, and despite a formidable career, has not generally been regarded as in the front rank of the legal profession&quot;.

When she announced her retirement, an anonymous academic said that Gaudron had failed to achieve the expectations set by her supporters, and that among the other High Court Justices, Gaudron was &quot;erratic&quot; and &quot;certainly not among the court&#x27;s greats&quot;. Another anonymous academic said that Gaudron&#x27;s Labor connections had delivered her unearned promotions.

==Approbation==
Despite this anonymous criticism, Gaudron also received much praise. Former President of the New South Wales Bar, Ruth McColl, described Gaudron&#x27;s contribution to Australian law as &quot;an extraordinarily humanising effect ... the strong views she expresses in cases involving discrimination and like issues, are very influential and important in the development of the law in those areas&quot;. The Anti-Discrimination Commissioner of Tasmania, Jocelynne Scutt, said that &quot;her contribution has been outstanding both as a jurist and as an advocate. And it has been profoundly significant in terms of her being a woman, too.&quot; Former Chief Justice Anthony Mason remarked that Gaudron&#x27;s &quot;contribution just can&#x27;t be described as symbolic&quot;, but rather she had &quot;made a very significant and genuine contribution&quot; to Australian law.

Gaudron described herself in 2005 as privileged &quot;to be a bit player in the maintenance of the rule of law in Australia&quot;.

==Family==
Gaudron has two daughters, Danielle and Julienne, with her first husband, Ben Nurse. Danielle was born during her final year of Law School and Julienne was a baby at her appointment to the Arbitration Commission. She also has a son, Patrick, with her second husband, John Fogarty.

<text>Mr. Baseball is a 1992 American sports comedy film directed by Fred Schepisi, starring Tom Selleck, Ken Takakura, Dennis Haysbert, and Aya Takanashi. It depicts a tumultuous season in the career of veteran New York Yankees first baseman Jack Elliot, who is traded to the Chunichi Dragons of the Japanese Central League during Spring Training, and forced to contend with overwhelming expectations and cultural differences during the Dragons&#x27; run at the pennant.

Although the film was a limited success, it remains accurate, as of the 2020s, in portraying the peculiarities of Japanese baseball. It is used as a training resource by foreign professional baseball players who join a Japanese team.

==Plot==
Jack Elliot is an aging American baseball player unsuspectingly put on the trading block during Spring Training in 1992 by the New York Yankees in favor of &quot;rookie phenom&quot; first baseman Ricky Davis, and there&#x27;s only one taker: the Nagoya Chunichi Dragons of Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball.

Upon arrival in Japan, Elliot clashes with the Japanese culture and the team&#x27;s manager, and before long he alienates his new teammates. He believes the rules and management style of his new skipper, Uchiyama, are ludicrous, and continues to do things his way, which leads his already dwindling performance to suffer even more. His only ally on the team is another American ballplayer, Max &quot;The Hammer&quot; Dubois, with whom he commiserates about his frustrations. However, Max is a team player on the Dragons, and warns Elliot to be one too. At the same time, Elliot develops a relationship with the beautiful Hiroko, who he later learns is Uchiyama&#x27;s daughter.

After one too many outbursts, including knocking out his interpreter during a brawl, Elliot is suspended from play. After meeting Hiroko&#x27;s family, including Uchiyama, Uchiyama admits to Jack that he hired him over the objections of management and now his own career, not just Jack&#x27;s, is in jeopardy. Dragons management wanted Pete Clifton from Boston, but Uchiyama pulled some strings with management to pick Jack because he was the right choice to turn the team around. After hearing this, Elliot swallows his pride and admits his deficiencies. Uchiyama becomes his mentor. In a rare show of humility, he apologizes to the team in Japanese, erroneously saying he wants to build a rather than a of friendship (the words are homophones but stressed differently) and the team rallies around him and teaches him the value of sportsmanship and respect for hard work. Uchiyama lifts his suspension and begins to work with Elliot on improving his play. The reinvigorated Elliot&#x27;s enthusiasm for team play is contagious and the mediocre Dragons become contenders for the Central League pennant. In the process, he also utilizes a Japanese tradition of being able to tell off Uchiyama while intoxicated to convince him to encourage his players to be more aggressive and &quot;have a little fun.&quot;

Eventually, Elliot gets the opportunity to break Uchiyama&#x27;s record of seven consecutive games with a home run, but not before his positive response to a call from his American agent complicates his relationship with Hiroko. His newfound respect for team play becomes apparent in a crucial game against the Yomiuri Giants. With the bases loaded, two outs and his team down 6–5, the team brass expects Uchiyama to signal for a bunt to try to tie the game, even though it would deny Elliot the chance to break the home run record. Elliot goes to Uchiyama and asks if he read the sign correctly. Uchiyama nods and tells him to swing away, knowing that a home run would break his record. Elliot takes a called strike one with a questionable call on the first pitch. Elliot fouls the second pitch back. Faced with a no-ball, two-strike count, Elliot sees the Giants&#x27; infield is playing deep and bunts. The Giants are caught off-guard and the bunt is successful in allowing the tying run to cross home plate. As the Giants struggle to field the ball, Elliot, approaching first base, veers slightly inside the baseline and knocks over the Giants&#x27; pitcher covering first on the play, which allows the winning run to score from second base.

With the Dragons winning the pennant, Uchiyama can keep his job and Max ends his five-year career in NPB by signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Elliot, who marries Hiroko, becomes a coach and mentor with the Detroit Tigers. The movie ends with one of the players calling him Chief, which is the same as he called Uchiyama in Japan.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
According to director Fred Schepisi, the original premise for &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; — a baseball comedy that explored cultural differences between Japan and the United States—was conceived after the commercial success of the 1989 film &quot;Major League&quot;.

The first story treatment was drafted by Theo Pelletier, a writer with no previous film credits to his name, and developed into a screenplay by Monte Merrick and Gary Ross. When Schepisi came onto the project, Tom Selleck had already been cast as the lead, and because of an unusual clause in his contract, had final say over the approval of the script. This resulted in the involvement of another screenwriter, Kevin Wade.

Complicating matters further was the takeover of Universal Studios by Japanese conglomerate Matsushita (now known as Panasonic, which was previously a subsidiary of Matsushita). Universal was concerned about issues of cultural sensitivity in the depiction of Japanese characters, so they recruited John Junkerman, an experienced writer and director of films about Japan, to rework the story. Schepisi and a fourth screenwriter, Ed Solomon, traveled to Japan to do research.

After returning from Japan, Schepisi and Solomon rewrote the entire script, highlighting cultural clashes between the characters for comic effect, but this version in turn was rewritten by Kevin Wade to accommodate Tom Selleck. Since Wade&#x27;s contract expired mid-way through production, however, he only worked on it for about three weeks, leaving many loose ends that eventually had to be sorted out by Schepisi. In the end, the participation of many people in the process resulted in a screenplay that was much more conventional than Schepisi originally intended.

In a later interview, he said he felt as though the film was not as good as it could have been:
===Filming===
Filming of &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; took place primarily in Nagoya, with limited filming in Tokyo, Florida, and New York. Doug Claybourne, one of the producers, began preparation for location filming in Japan in 1991. Most scenes were filmed in the city of Nagoya, including a number that were eventually cut from the film. Most prominent are the scenes filmed at Nagoya Stadium, the former home of the Chunichi Dragons in Otobashi, Nagoya. Thousands of local extras volunteered to sit in the stands during the filming of game situations, even braving a typhoon to cheer on the fictionalized Dragons during their climactic showdown with the Yomiuri Giants.

Filming of other scenes did not range very far from the stadium. Two scenes of Jack Elliot and his interpreter Yoji (Toshi Shioya), were filmed on the Meitetsu Line shuttling between Nagoya Station and Kanayama Station. The scenes at Jack Elliot&#x27;s suite apartment were filmed at the Tsukimi-ga-oka Mansion complex in Kakuozan, a thirty-minute subway and local train ride from the stadium. The scene in which Jack is interviewed by , MC of the CBC TV sports program &quot;&quot;, was filmed on the actual set of the program (although, as Kuno has noted, the shot was very brief and he had no opportunity to speak with Selleck on set). 
Scenes of Jack and Hiroko&#x27;s visit to local shrines were filmed at the Ōsu Kannon marketplace, near the heart of the city&#x27;s commercial district. Sequentially, the scenes at Ōsu begin with Jack praying and clanging the bell at Fuji Sengen Shrine, before moving to Banshō-ji to offer incense. The building that housed Hiroko&#x27;s &quot;Concepts Graphic Designs&quot; still stands in the Minami-yama/Hibari-ga-oka neighborhood of Nagoya, although the Minami-yama Pharmacy located next door has since changed locations to Irinaka. A scene in which Jack meets a group of other expatriate American ballplayers at a foreigners&#x27; bar was filmed in Sakae, on the site of the current Shooter&#x27;s.

Only two scenes set in Japan were filmed outside of Nagoya:
# Jack&#x27;s &quot;Big Hit, Happy Body&quot; commercial, filmed in a tea field overlooking Mikawa Bay.
# Jack&#x27;s visits to the home of his manager, Uchiyama, which appear to have been filmed in the Komaki or Inuyama area.

Commenting on his working relationship with Selleck, Schepisi commented &quot;He was extremely helpful getting the baseball thing right. Getting the American pride thing right.&quot;

====Alternate scenes====
Three scenes that were eventually cut from the North American release of the film (but retained in the Japanese release) were also filmed in Nagoya. All three scenes cast light on Jack&#x27;s relationships with Uchiyama and Hiroko. These include:
# an exchange between Jack and Hiroko in Osu, in the arcade leading down to Bansho-ji Temple.
# an exchange between Jack and Hiroko in front of Tsukimi-ga-oka Mansion.
# a dialogue between Jack and Uchiyama (Ken Takakura) in the Heiwa Park cemetery.

===Stadiums===
Throughout the film, the Dragons play every team in the Japanese Central League except the Hanshin Tigers and Yakult Swallows (although Yoji quotes from an article from Chunichi Sports newspaper praising a leaping catch that Jack made to close the door against the Swallows). Nearly all are home games, filmed at Nagoya Baseball Stadium with extras in the stands. The only road game the Dragons play in the film is against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, filmed on location at nearby Okazaki Stadium in Aichi Prefecture. The Yokohama Taiyo Whales were rebranded the Yokohama BayStars by the time the film premiered in Japan in February 1993.

The spring training baseball scene was filmed at Dedeaux Field on the campus of the University of Southern California.

===Uniforms===
All the uniforms, caps, and training gear featured in the film are authentic and current at the time of release. The Los Angeles Dodgers-inspired uniforms that the Chunichi Dragons players wear in the film—with the royal blue caps emblazoned with white &quot;D&quot; insignias in Casey font—are the same that the Dragons wore between 1987 and 1996. Oddly, the insignia on the Dragons cap is changed in the American theatrical release poster, emblazoned instead with a more angular &quot;D&quot; topped by a macron. The Dragons have never worn a cap like this.

The Detroit Tigers cap that Selleck wears in the last scene of the film, when he is coaching a rookie at the Tigers spring training facility, is the same cap he donned while playing the role of Thomas Magnum in the classic television series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; Tom Selleck, who hails from Detroit, Michigan, is a lifelong Detroit Tigers fan and former minority shareholder of the team.

===Models===
While the movie is entirely fictitious, certain characters and scenes are based on real-life personalities and events. The character of Uchiyama, manager of the team, is very closely based on Senichi Hoshino, who managed the Dragons from 1987 to 1991 (he returned to manage the Dragons from 1996 to 2001). The scene in which Elliot taunts an opposing pitcher who refuses to throw him a strike by gripping the bat upside down was apparently based on a real-life incident. Western player Randy Bass, playing for the Hanshin Tigers who was challenging Japan&#x27;s single-season home run record in 1985, also tauntingly turned his bat around in protest. Similarly, Hankyu Braves player Daryl Spencer did this as he was challenging an offensive Triple Crown in 1965. The African American sidekick role, played by Dennis Haysbert, is believed to be based on the experiences of several African American players in Japan, including brothers Leron Lee and Leon Lee (who was a consultant on the film and has a cameo role).

===Advisors===
Many former players, baseball historians, and Japan experts served as advisors on the film, including former Lotte/Yokohama/Yakult slugger Leon Lee (who also makes a brief cameo in the film) and former MLB/Yakult Swallows player Doug DeCinces. Brad Lesley, another former American expat baseball player, has a small role in the film, as Alan Niven—playing a slugger rather than his natural position of relief pitcher.

==Promotion==
Universal released a theatrical trailer for &quot;Mr Baseball&quot; in the summer of 1992. The trailer, which runs two minutes and fourteen seconds, features dialogue and scenes that are absent from the final version of the film.

For example, at the scene of Jack&#x27;s first press conference, Yoji asks, &quot;have you ever slept with Madonna?&quot; During his first meeting with Uchiyama, Jack responds to the demand to shave his moustache by saying, &quot;he probably can&#x27;t even grow one.&quot; In the locker room scene where Jack is confused about how to use the Japanese-style toilet, he quips to Max, &quot;I need somebody to tell me how to go to the can&quot; (later changed in the final version of the film to &quot;I need somebody to tell me how to take a crap&quot;).

The music in the trailer is mostly sampled from Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s soundtrack, but also includes samples from &quot;Turning Japanese&quot; by The Vapors. The song also appears in the MCA Universal Home Video promotional tape distributed to video rental shops in 1993. &quot;Turning Japanese&quot; did not appear in the final version of the soundtrack.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Upon its release, &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; ... racks up a real home run for Tom Selleck.,&quot; comparing the actor to Clark Gable. Bill Diehl of ABC called &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; &quot;uproariously funny,&quot; while Steve Wille of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; glowed, &quot;Tom Selleck deserves a baseball Oscar.&quot;

Siskel and Ebert, in their review of the film, commented on its formulaic plot and lackluster writing, but also praised the film for its realistic crowd shots, direction, and Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s soundtrack. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; singled out Selleck&#x27;s performance for praise, writing, &quot;The character of Jack, whose being sent to Japan is the impetus for &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot;, provides Mr. Selleck with something unusual: a movie role that actually suits his talents. Mr. Selleck&#x27;s easygoing, self-deprecating manner works particularly well when he lets himself look silly, as he often does here.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; currently holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews — most of them written years after the film&#x27;s release; conversely, audiences gave the film a 41% rating. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Box office===
&quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; opened in 1,855 theaters on Friday, October 2, 1992. During its first weekend, it grossed over $5 million at the box office, coming in third behind &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;. During its six-week run in theatres, it went on to gross $20.8 million domestically.

Despite the limited marketability of baseball movies overseas, Universal positioned it for a wide distribution beyond the North American market. However, a disappointing showing in Japan and Europe prevented the studio from recouping on its enormous expenses. &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; (ミスター・ベースボール) opened in theaters in Japan on February 6, 1993, and proceeded to gross a disappointing ¥150 million ($1.25 million).

By the end of its run in Japan, during the summer of 1993, it appeared as the &quot;B film&quot; in Universal double features—such as with the Robert Redford and River Phoenix film &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992). Screenings in European theatres followed, but with little fanfare. It premiered in Germany on June 16, 1993.

===Fan culture in Nagoya===
Since 2011, an American fan dressed as Jack Elliot has garnered media attention for his enthusiastic support of the Chunichi Dragons, especially their minor-league affiliate, which plays in the old Nagoya Stadium — the setting of the film.

===Home media===
MCA Universal Home Video released &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; on VHS in March, 1993. It was later reissued in 1997.

=== By professional players ===
&quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; has found a niche audience in foreign professional baseball players who join a Japanese team. They use the film to prepare themselves for what they are about to experience.

According to baseball players interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2022, the film still accurately portrays the peculiarities of Japanese baseball.
