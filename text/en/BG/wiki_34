<text>Lycoperdon is a genus of puffball mushrooms. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 50 species. In general, it contains the smaller species such as the pear-shaped puffball and the gem-studded puffball. It was formerly classified within the now-obsolete order Lycoperdales, as the type genus which, following a restructuring of fungal taxonomy brought about by molecular phylogeny, has been split. &quot;Lycoperdon&quot; is now placed in the family Agaricaceae of the order Agaricales.

The scientific name has been created with Greek words (&quot;lycos&quot; meaning &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;perdomai&quot; meaning &quot;to fart&quot;) and based on several European dialects in which the mushroom name sounds like &quot;wolf-farts&quot;. 

Most species are edible, ranging from mild to tasting distinctly of shrimp.

<text>CV/gate (an abbreviation of &quot;control voltage/gate&quot;) is an analog method of controlling synthesizers, drum machines, and similar equipment with external sequencers. The control voltage typically controls pitch and the gate signal controls note on-off.

This method was widely used in the epoch of analog modular synthesizers and CV/Gate music sequencers, since the introduction of the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer in 1977 through to the 1980s, when it was eventually superseded by the MIDI protocol (introduced in 1983), which is more feature-rich, easier to configure reliably, and more readily supports polyphony. The advent of digital synthesizers also made it possible to store and retrieve voice &quot;patches&quot; – eliminating patch cables and (for the most part) control voltages. However, numerous companies – including Doepfer, who designed a modular system for Kraftwerk in 1992, Buchla, MOTM, Analogue Systems, and others continue to manufacture modular synthesizers that are increasingly popular and rely primarily on analog CV/gate signals for communication. Additionally, some recent non-modular synthesizers (such as the Alesis Andromeda) and many effects devices (including the Moogerfooger pedals by Moog as well as many guitar oriented devices) include CV/gate connectivity. Many modern studios use a hybrid of MIDI and CV/gate to allow synchronization of older and newer equipment.

== Basic usage ==

In modular synthesizers, each synthesizer component (e.g., low frequency oscillation (LFO), voltage controlled filter (VCF), etc.) can be connected to another component by means of a patch cable that transmits voltage. Changes in that voltage cause changes to one or more parameters of the component. This frequently involved a keyboard transmitting two types of data (CV and gate), or control modules such as LFOs and envelope generators transmitting CV data:
* Control voltage (CV) indicates which note (event) to play: a different voltage for each key pressed; those voltages are typically connected to one or more oscillators, thus producing the different pitches required. Such a method implies that the synthesizer is monophonic. CV can also control parameters such as rate, depth and duration of a control module.
* Trigger indicates when a note should start, a pulse that is used to trigger an event, typically an ADSR envelope. In the case of triggering a drum machine, a clock signal or LFO square wave could be employed to signal the next beat. The trigger can be a specific part of an electronic pulse, such as the rising slope of an electronic signal.
* Gate is related to a Trigger, but sustains the signal throughout the event. It turns on when the signal goes high, and turns off when the signal goes low.

=== CV ===

The concept of CV is fairly standard on analog synthesizers, but not its implementation. For pitch control via CV, there are two prominent implementations:
* Volts per octave was popularized by Bob Moog in the 1960s, and was widely adopted for control interfacing. One volt represents one octave, so the pitch produced by a voltage of 3 V is one octave lower than that produced by a voltage of 4 V. Each 1 V octave can be divided linearly into 12 semi-tones. Companies using this CV method included Roland, Moog, Sequential Circuits, Oberheim, ARP and the Eurorack standard from Doepfer, including more than 7000 modules from at least 316 manufacturers. This convention typically had control modules carry the source voltage (B+, 5 V) on the ring of a TRS jack, with the processed voltage returning on the tip. However, other manufacturers have used different implementations with voltages including –5 V to 5 V, 0 V to 5 V, 0 V to 10 V with the B+ possibly on the tip. This makes interoperability of modules problematic.
* Hertz per volt, used by most but not all Korg and Yamaha synthesizers, represents an octave of pitch by doubling voltage, so the pitch represented by 2 V is one octave lower than that represented by 4 V, and one higher than that represented by 1 V.

The table compares notes and corresponding voltage levels in both implementations (this example uses 1 V per octave and 55 Hz/V):

The voltages are linked by the formula formula_1, which can also be written formula_2.

These two implementations are not critically incompatible: voltage levels used are comparable and there are no other safety concerns. So, for example, connecting a Hz/volt keyboard to a volts/octave synthesizer will likely produce some sound, but it will be completely out of tune. At least one commercial interface has been created to solve the problem, the Korg MS-02 CV/trigger interface.

On synthesizers the CV signal may be labelled &quot;CV&quot;, &quot;VCO in&quot;, &quot;keyboard in&quot;, &quot;OSC&quot; or &quot;keyboard voltage&quot;.

CV control of parameters other than pitch usually follows the same pattern of minimum to maximum voltage. For example, Moog modular synthesizers use the 0 V - 5 V control voltage for all other parameters. They are represented on the front panel of many synthesizers as knobs, but often a patch bay allows the input or output of the related CV to synchronize multiple modules together. The pitch voltage from a keyboard could also be used to control the rate of an LFO, which could be applied to the volume of the oscillator output, creating a tremolo that becomes faster as the pitch rises. Modules that can be controlled by CV include VCF, VCA, high and low frequency oscillators, ring modulators, sample and hold circuits and noise injection.

=== Trigger ===

Trigger also has two implementations:
* V-trigger, &quot;voltage trigger&quot;, or &quot;positive trigger&quot; normally holds voltage low (around 0 v) and at trigger produces a fixed positive voltage to switch a note on. The trigger voltage level differs among brands, from 2 V to 10 V. V-trigger is used by Roland and Sequential Circuits synthesizers, among others.
* S-trigger, &quot;short circuit trigger&quot;, or &quot;negative trigger&quot; normally holds voltage high, shorting the trigger to ground when the note should play. S-trigger were used in the early Moog Modular systems, however they are rarely used nowadays. This is not to be confused with the inverted gate signals used in Korg and Yamaha synthesizers.

Depending on the voltage level, connecting an incompatible triggering system will either yield no sound at all or reverse all keypress events (i.e. sound will be produced with no keys pressed and muted on keypress).

On older equipment, the gate/trigger signal may be labelled &quot;gate&quot;, &quot;trig&quot; or &quot;S-trig&quot;.

=== Gate ===
* Like a Trigger, gate signal voltage may vary among brands. In some implementations, gate signals may even dip into negative voltage ranges. Gate inputs are typically isolated, or &quot;buffered&quot; to prevent damage to some equipment that cannot handle excessive or negative voltages.

== Modern usage ==

Since the publishing of the MIDI standard in 1983, usage of CV/gate to control synthesizers has decreased dramatically. The most criticized aspect of the CV/gate interface is the allowance of only a single note to sound at a single moment of time.

Shortly after the MIDI standard came out Roland introduced the Roland MPU-101, a MIDI to CV/gate converter that takes an input from four MIDI channels; i.e. a variable base MIDI channel plus the next three consecutive MIDI channels and converted up to four MIDI channels into four separate CV/gate outputs able to control four separate CV/gate synthesizers or a four-voice synthesizer like the Oberheim Four Voice analog synthesizer which is made up of four separate monophonic SEM modules.

However, the 1990s saw renewed interest in analog synthesizers and various other equipment. In order to facilitate synchronization between these older instruments and newer MIDI-enabled equipment, some companies produced several models of CV/gate-MIDI interfaces. Some models target controlling a single type of synthesizer and have fixed CV and gate implementation, while some models are more customizable and include methods to switch used implementation.

CV/gate is also very easy to implement and it remains an easier alternative for homemade and modern modular synthesizers. Also, various equipment, such as stage lighting, sometimes uses a CV/gate interface. For example, a strobe light can be controlled using CV to set light intensity or color and gate to turn an effect on and off. With the resurgence of non-modular analog synthesizers, the exposure of synthesizer parameters via CV/gate provided a way to achieve some of the flexibility of modular synthesizers. Some synthesizers could also generate CV/gate signals and be used to control other synthesizers.

One of the main advantages of CV/gate over MIDI is in the resolution. The fundamental MIDI control message uses seven bits or 128 possible steps for resolution. Thirty two controls per channel allow MSB (Most Significant Byte) and LSB (Least Significant Byte) together to specify 14 bits or 16,384 possible steps of total resolution. Control voltage is analog and by extension infinitely variable. There is less likelihood of hearing the zipper effect or noticeable steps in resolution over large parameter sweeps. Human hearing is especially sensitive to pitch changes, and for this reason MIDI pitch bend uses 14 bits fundamentally. Beyond the 512 directly defined 14-bit controls, MIDI also defines tens of thousands of 14-bit RPNs (Registered Parameter Number) and NRPNs (Non-Registered Parameter Number), but there is no method described for going beyond 14 bits.

A major difference between CV/gate and MIDI is that in many analog synthesizers no distinction is made between voltages that represent control and voltages that represent audio. This means that audio signals can be used to modify control voltages and vice versa. In MIDI they are completely separate however, and additional software such as Expert Sleepers is required to convert analog CV signals into numerical MIDI control data.

Some software synthesizers emulate control voltages to allow their virtual modules to be controlled as early analog synthesizers were. For example, Reason allows myriad connection possibilities with CV, and allows gate signals to have a &quot;level&quot; rather than a simple on-off (for example, to trigger not just a note, but the velocity of that note).

In 2009, Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU) released a virtual instrument plug-in, Volta, allowing Mac-based audio workstations with Audio Units support to control some hardware devices. CV control is based on the audio interface line level outputs, and as such only supports a limited number of synthesizers.

In recent years, many guitar effects processors have been designed with CV input. Implementations vary widely and are not compatible with one another so it is critical to understand how a manufacturer is producing the CV before attempting to use multiple processors in a system. Moog has facilitated this by producing two interfaces designed to receive and transmit CV in a system, the MP-201 (which includes MIDI) and the CP-251. Examples of effects allowing the use of CV include delays (Electroharmonix DMB and DMTT, Toneczar Echoczar, Line6, Strymon and others), tremolo (Goatkeeper), Flange (Foxrox Paradox), envelope generators/lowpass filters/ring modulators (Big Briar, WMD) and distortion (WMD).

<text>CIH, also known as Chernobyl or Spacefiller, is a Microsoft Windows 9x computer virus that first emerged in 1998. Its payload is highly destructive to vulnerable systems, overwriting critical information on infected system drives and, in some cases, destroying the system BIOS. The virus was created by Chen Ing-hau (陳盈豪, pinyin: &quot;Chén Yíngháo&quot;), a student at Tatung University in Taiwan. It was believed to have infected sixty million computers internationally, resulting in an estimated () in commercial damages.

Chen claimed to have written the virus as a challenge against bold claims of antiviral efficiency by antivirus software developers. Chen stated that after classmates at Tatung University spread the virus, he apologized to the school and made an antivirus program available for public download. Weng Shi-hao (翁世豪), a student at Tamkang University, co-authored with the antivirus program. Prosecutors in Taiwan could not charge Chen at the time because no victims came forward with a lawsuit. Nevertheless, these events led to new computer crime legislation in Taiwan.

The name &quot;Chernobyl Virus&quot; was coined sometime after the virus was already well known as CIH and refers to the complete coincidence of the payload trigger date in some variants of the virus (actually the virus creation date in 1998, to trigger exactly a year later) and the Chernobyl disaster, which happened in the Soviet Union on April 26, 1986.

The name &quot;Spacefiller&quot; was introduced because most viruses write their code to the end of the infected file, with infected files being detectable because their file size increases. In contrast, CIH looks for gaps in the existing program code, where it then writes its code, preventing an increase in file size; in that way, the virus avoids detection.

==History==
The virus first emerged in 1998. In March 1999, several thousand IBM Aptivas shipped with the CIH virus, just one month before the virus would trigger. In July 1999, copies of remote administration tool Back Orifice 2000 given out to DEF CON 7 attendees were discovered by the organizers to have been infected with CIH. On December 31, 1999, Yamaha shipped a software update to their CD-R400 drives that was infected with the virus. In July 1998, a demo version of the first-person shooter game &quot;Sin&quot; was infected by one of its mirror sites.

CIH&#x27;s dual payload was delivered for the first time on April 26, 1999, with most of the damage occurring in Asia. CIH filled the first 1024 KB of the host&#x27;s boot drive with zeros and then attacked certain types of BIOS. Both of these payloads served to render the host computer inoperable, and for most ordinary users, the virus essentially destroyed the PC. Technically, however, it was possible to replace the BIOS chip, and methods for recovering hard disk data emerged later.

The virus made another comeback in 2001 when a variant of the LoveLetter Worm in a VBS file that contained a dropper routine for the CIH virus was circulated around the internet under the guise of a nude picture of Jennifer Lopez.

A modified version of the virus called CIH.1106 was discovered in December 2002, but it is not widespread and only affects Windows 9x-based systems.

==Virus specifics==
CIH spreads under the Portable Executable file format under the Windows 9x-based operating systems, Windows 95, 98, and ME. CIH does not spread under Windows NT-based operating systems nor Win16-based operating systems such as Windows 3.x or below.

CIH infects Portable Executable files by splitting the bulk of its code into small slivers inserted into the inter-section gaps commonly seen in PE files and writing a small re-assembly routine and table of its own code segments&#x27; locations into unused space in the tail of the PE header. This earned CIH another name, &quot;Spacefiller&quot;. The size of the virus is around 1 kilobyte, but due to its novel multiple-cavity infection method, infected files do not grow at all. It uses methods of jumping from processor ring 3 to 0 to hook system calls.

The payload, which is considered extremely dangerous, first involves the virus overwriting the first megabyte (1024KB) of the hard drive with zeroes, beginning at sector 0. This deletes the contents of the partition table, and may cause the machine to hang or cue the blue screen of death.

The second payload tries to write to the Flash BIOS. BIOSes that can be successfully written to by the virus have critical boot-time codes replaced with junk. This routine only works on some machines. Much emphasis has been put on machines with motherboards based on the Intel 430TX chipset, but by far the most important variable in CIH&#x27;s success in writing to a machine&#x27;s BIOS is the type of Flash ROM chip in the machine. Different Flash ROM chips (or chip families) have different write-enable routines specific to those chips. CIH makes no attempt to test for the Flash ROM type in its victim machines and has only one write-enable sequence.

For the first payload, any information that the virus has overwritten with zeros is lost. If the first partition is FAT32, and over about one gigabyte, all that will get overwritten is the MBR, the partition table, the boot sector of the first partition and the first copy of the FAT of the first partition. The MBR and boot sectors can simply be replaced with copies of the standard versions; the partition table can be rebuilt by scanning over the entire drive and the first copy of the FAT can be restored from the second copy. This means a complete recovery with no loss of user data can be performed automatically by a tool like Fix CIH.

If the first partition is not FAT32 or is smaller than 1 GB, the bulk of user data on that partition will still be intact, but without the root directory and FAT it will be difficult to find it, especially if there is significant fragmentation.

If the second payload executes successfully, the computer will not start at all. Reprogramming or replacement of the Flash BIOS chip is then required, as most systems that CIH can affect predate BIOS restoration features.

<doc id="312671" wikidata="Q1764619" url="?curid=312671" title="Mechanosynthesis">
<text>Mechanosynthesis is a term for hypothetical chemical syntheses in which reaction outcomes are determined by the use of mechanical constraints to direct reactive molecules to specific molecular sites. There are presently no non-biological chemical syntheses which achieve this aim. Some atomic placement has been achieved with scanning tunnelling microscopes.

==Introduction==
In conventional chemical synthesis or chemosynthesis, reactive molecules encounter one another through random thermal motion in a liquid or vapor. In a hypothesized process of mechanosynthesis, reactive molecules would be attached to molecular mechanical systems, and their encounters would result from mechanical motions bringing them together in planned sequences, positions, and orientations. It is envisioned that mechanosynthesis would avoid unwanted reactions by keeping potential reactants apart, and would strongly favor desired reactions by holding reactants together in optimal orientations for many molecular vibration cycles. In biology, the ribosome provides an example of a programmable mechanosynthetic device.

A non-biological form of mechanochemistry has been performed at cryogenic temperatures using scanning tunneling microscopes. So far, such devices provide the closest approach to fabrication tools for molecular engineering. Broader exploitation of mechanosynthesis awaits more advanced technology for constructing molecular machine systems, with ribosome-like systems as an attractive early objective.

Much of the excitement regarding advanced mechanosynthesis regards its potential use in assembly of molecular-scale devices. Such techniques appear to have many applications in medicine, aviation, resource extraction, manufacturing and warfare.

Most theoretical explorations of advanced machines of this kind have focused on using carbon, because of the many strong bonds it can form, the many types of chemistry these bonds permit, and utility of these bonds in medical and mechanical applications. Carbon forms diamond, for example, which if cheaply available, would be an excellent material for many machines.

It has been suggested, notably by K. Eric Drexler, that mechanosynthesis will be fundamental to molecular manufacturing based on nanofactories capable of building macroscopic objects with atomic precision. The potential for these has been disputed, notably by Nobel Laureate Richard Smalley (who proposed and then critiqued an unworkable approach based on &quot;Smalley fingers&quot;).

The Nanofactory Collaboration, founded by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle in 2000, is a focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda specifically aimed at positionally controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development.

In practice, getting exactly one molecule to a known place on the microscope&#x27;s tip is possible, but has proven difficult to automate. Since practical products require at least several hundred million atoms, this technique has not yet proven practical in forming a real product.

The goal of one line of mechanoassembly research focuses on overcoming these problems by calibration, and selection of appropriate synthesis reactions. Some suggest attempting to develop a specialized, very small (roughly 1,000 nanometers on a side) machine tool that can build copies of itself using mechanochemical means, under the control of an external computer. In the literature, such a tool is called an assembler or molecular assembler. Once assemblers exist, geometric growth (directing copies to make copies) could reduce the cost of assemblers rapidly. Control by an external computer should then permit large groups of assemblers to construct large, useful projects to atomic precision. One such project would combine molecular-level conveyor belts with permanently mounted assemblers to produce a factory.

In part to resolve this and related questions about the dangers of industrial accidents and popular fears of runaway events equivalent to Chernobyl and Bhopal disasters, and the more remote issue of ecophagy, grey goo and green goo (various potential disasters arising from runaway replicators, which could be built using mechanosynthesis) the UK Royal Society and UK Royal Academy of Engineering in 2003 commissioned a study to deal with these issues and larger social and ecological implications, led by mechanical engineering professor Ann Dowling. This was anticipated by some to take a strong position on these problems and potentials —– and suggest any development path to a general theory of so-called mechanosynthesis. However, the Royal Society&#x27;s nanotech report did not address molecular manufacturing at all, except to dismiss it along with grey goo.

Current technical proposals for nanofactories do not include self-replicating nanorobots, and recent ethical guidelines would prohibit development of unconstrained self-replication capabilities in nanomachines.

==Diamond mechanosynthesis==

There is a growing body of peer-reviewed theoretical work on synthesizing diamond by mechanically removing/adding hydrogen atoms and depositing carbon atoms (a process known as diamond mechanosynthesis or DMS). 
For example, the 2006 paper in this continuing research effort by Freitas, Merkle and their collaborators reports that the most-studied mechanosynthesis tooltip motif (DCB6Ge) successfully places a C2 carbon dimer on a C(110) diamond surface at both 300 K (room temperature) and 80 K (liquid nitrogen temperature), and that the silicon variant (DCB6Si) also works at 80 K but not at 300 K. These tooltips are intended to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e.g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for tooltip translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in paper III—tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly. Over 100,000 CPU hours were invested in this study.

The DCB6Ge tooltip motif, initially described at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was the first complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface. Although an early paper gives a predicted placement speed of 1 dimer per second for this tooltip, this limit was imposed by the slow speed of recharging the tool using an inefficient recharging method and is not based on any inherent limitation in the speed of use of a charged tooltip. Additionally, no sensing means was proposed for discriminating among the three possible outcomes of an attempted dimer placement—deposition at the correct location, deposition at the wrong location, and failure to place the dimer at all—because the initial proposal was to position the tooltip by dead reckoning, with the proper reaction assured by designing appropriate chemical energetics and relative bond strengths for the tooltip-surface interaction.

More recent theoretical work analyzes a complete set of nine molecular tools made from hydrogen, carbon and germanium able to (a) synthesize all tools in the set (b) recharge all tools in the set from appropriate feedstock molecules and (c) synthesize a wide range of stiff hydrocarbons (diamond, graphite, fullerenes, and the like). All required reactions are analyzed using standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods.

Further research to consider alternate tips will require time-consuming computational chemistry and difficult laboratory work.
In the early 2000s, a typical experimental arrangement was to attach a molecule to the tip of an atomic force microscope, and then use the microscope&#x27;s precise positioning abilities to push the molecule on the tip into another on a substrate. Since the angles and distances can be precisely controlled, and the reaction occurs in a vacuum, novel chemical compounds and arrangements are possible.

==History==
The technique of moving single atoms mechanically was proposed by Eric Drexler in his 1986 book &quot;The Engines of Creation&quot;.

In 1989, researchers at IBM&#x27;s Zürich Research Institute successfully spelled the letters &quot;IBM&quot; in xenon atoms on a cryogenic copper surface, grossly validating the approach. Since then, a number of research projects have undertaken to use similar techniques to store computer data in a compact fashion. More recently the technique has been used to explore novel physical chemistries, sometimes using lasers to excite the tips to particular energy states, or examine the quantum chemistry of particular chemical bonds.

In 1999, an experimentally proved methodology called feature-oriented scanning (FOS) was suggested. The feature-oriented scanning methodology allows precisely controlling the position of the probe of a scanning probe microscope (SPM) on an atomic surface at room temperature. The suggested methodology supports fully automatic control of single- and multiprobe instruments in solving tasks of mechanosynthesis and bottom-up nanofabrication.

In 2003, Oyabu &quot;et al.&quot; reported the first instance of purely mechanical-based covalent bond-making and bond-breaking, i.e., the first experimental demonstration of true mechanosynthesis—albeit with silicon rather than carbon atoms.

In 2005, the first patent application on diamond mechanosynthesis was filed.

In 2008, a $3.1 million grant was proposed to fund the development of a proof-of-principle mechanosynthesis system.

In 2013, IBM made &quot;A Boy and His Atom&quot;, a short animated film using atoms.

<doc id="312672" wikidata="Q5658623" url="?curid=312672" title="Harlem World">
<text>Harlem World is the debut studio album by American rapper Mase. It was released on October 28, 1997, by Bad Boy Records and Arista Records. The album was nominated at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album. It went on to sell 4.9 million copies, being certified as quadruple platinum in the United States.

It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on November 15, 1997, selling nearly 273,000 copies in its first week.

==Reception==

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said of the album: &quot;...creatively refreshing, well-crafted lyrics... rap&#x27;s newest bad boy more than holds his own on his solo debut... his distinctive marble-mouthed drawl... creates a regular-guy persona all too rare in hip-hop.&quot;Muzik (4/9, p.84) - 4 stars (out of 5) - &quot;...Harlem on the rise? Most definitely.&quot;
Rap Pages (1/98, p.105) - Solid Material - &quot;...Creatively refreshing, well-crafted lyrics and a high-energy track over a hyped beat easily make this...&quot;

In 2008, the single &quot;Feel So Good&quot; was ranked number 67 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.

<text>Jacques Salomon Hadamard (; 8 December 1865 – 17 October 1963) was a French mathematician who made major contributions in number theory, complex analysis, differential geometry, and partial differential equations.

==Biography==
The son of a teacher, Amédée Hadamard, of Jewish descent, and Claire Marie Jeanne Picard, Hadamard was born in Versailles, France and attended the Lycée Charlemagne and Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where his father taught. In 1884 Hadamard entered the École Normale Supérieure, having placed first in the entrance examinations both there and at the École Polytechnique. His teachers included Tannery, Hermite, Darboux, Appell, Goursat, and Picard. He obtained his doctorate in 1892 and in the same year was awarded the for his essay on the Riemann zeta function.

In 1892 Hadamard married Louise-Anna Trénel, also of Jewish descent, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. The following year he took up a lectureship in the University of Bordeaux, where he proved his celebrated inequality on determinants, which led to the discovery of Hadamard matrices when equality holds. In 1896 he made two important contributions: he proved the prime number theorem, using complex function theory (also proved independently by Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin); and he was awarded the Bordin Prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his work on geodesics in the differential geometry of surfaces and dynamical systems. In the same year he was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Rational Mechanics in Bordeaux. His foundational work on geometry and symbolic dynamics continued in 1898 with the study of geodesics on surfaces of negative curvature. For his cumulative work, he was awarded the Prix Poncelet in 1898.

After the Dreyfus affair, which involved him personally because his second cousin Lucie was the wife of Dreyfus, Hadamard became politically active and a staunch supporter of Jewish causes though he professed to be an atheist in his religion.

In 1897 he moved back to Paris, holding positions in the Sorbonne and the Collège de France, where he was appointed Professor of Mechanics in 1909. In addition to this post, he was appointed to chairs of analysis at the École Polytechnique in 1912 and at the École Centrale in 1920, succeeding Jordan and Appell. In Paris Hadamard concentrated his interests on the problems of mathematical physics, in particular partial differential equations, the calculus of variations and the foundations of functional analysis. He introduced the idea of &quot;well-posed problem&quot; and the &quot;method of descent&quot; in the theory of partial differential equations, culminating in his seminal book on the subject, based on lectures given at Yale University in 1922. Later in his life he wrote on probability theory and mathematical education.

Hadamard was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1916, in succession to Poincaré, whose complete works he helped edit. He became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1920. He was elected a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1929. He visited the Soviet Union in 1930 and 1934 and China in 1936 at the invitation of Soviet and Chinese mathematicians.

Hadamard stayed in France at the beginning of the Second World War and escaped to southern France in 1940. The Vichy government permitted him to leave for the United States in 1941 and he obtained a visiting position at Columbia University in New York. He moved to London in 1944 and returned to France when the war ended in 1945.

Hadamard was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by Yale University in October 1901, during celebrations for the bicentenary of the university. He was awarded the CNRS Gold medal for his lifetime achievements in 1956. He died in Paris in 1963, aged ninety-seven.

Hadamard&#x27;s students included Maurice Fréchet, Paul Lévy, Szolem Mandelbrojt, and André Weil.

==On creativity==
In his book &quot;Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field&quot;, Hadamard uses the results of introspection to study mathematical thought processes, and tries to report and interpret observations, personal or gathered from other scholars engaged in the work of invention. In sharp contrast to authors who identify language and cognition, he describes his own mathematical thinking as largely wordless, often accompanied by mental images that represent the entire solution to a problem. He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of the day (approximately 1900), asking them how they did their work.

Hadamard described the experiences of the mathematicians/theoretical physicists Carl Friedrich Gauss, Hermann von Helmholtz, Henri Poincaré and others as viewing entire solutions with &quot;sudden spontaneousness&quot;.

Hadamard described the process as having four steps of the five-step Graham Wallas creative process model, with the first three also having been put forth by Helmholtz: Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification (Wallas&#x27; five stages added &quot;Intimation&quot; prior to Illumination, a sudden feeling of being about to find the solution to a problem).

<doc id="312678" wikidata="Q3352369" url="?curid=312678" title="Footpath">
<text>A footpath (also pedestrian way, walking trail, nature trail) is a type of thoroughfare that is intended for use only by pedestrians and not other forms of traffic such as motorized vehicles, bicycles and horses. They can be found in a wide variety of places, from the centre of cities, to farmland, to mountain ridges. Urban footpaths are usually paved, may have steps, and can be called alleys, lanes, steps, etc.

National parks, nature preserves, conservation areas and other protected wilderness areas may have footpaths (trails) that are restricted to pedestrians. The term footpath can also describe a pavement/sidewalk in some English-speaking countries (such as Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland).

A footpath can also take the form of a footbridge, linking two places across a river.

==Origins and history==

Public footpaths are rights of way originally created by people walking across the land to work, market, the next village, church, and school. This includes mass paths and corpse roads. Some footpaths were also created by those undertaking a pilgrimage. Examples of the latter are the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way in England and Pilgrim&#x27;s Route (St. Olav&#x27;s Way or the Old Kings&#x27; Road) in Norway. Some landowners allow access over their land without dedicating a right of way. These permissive paths are often indistinguishable from normal paths, but they are usually subject to restrictions. Such paths are often closed at least once a year, so that a permanent right of way cannot be established in law.

A mass path is a pedestrian track or road connecting destinations frequently used by rural communities, most usually the destination of Sunday Mass. They were most common during the centuries that preceded motorised transportation in Western Europe, and in particular the British Isles and the Netherlands (where such a path is called &quot;kerkenpad&quot; (lit. Church path). Mass paths typically included stretches crossing fields of neighboring farmers and were likely to contain stiles, when crossing fences or other boundaries, or plank footbridges to cross ditches. Some mass paths are still used today in the Republic of Ireland, but are usually subject to Ireland&#x27;s complicated rights of way law.

Corpse roads provided a practical means for transporting corpses, often from remote communities, to cemeteries that had burial rights, such as parish churches and chapels of ease. In Great Britain, such routes can also be known by a number of other names: bier road, burial road, coffin road, coffin line, lyke or lych way, funeral road, procession way, corpse way, etc.

Nowadays footpaths are mainly used for recreation and have been frequently linked together, along with bridle paths and newly created footpaths, to create long-distance trails. Also, organizations have been formed in various countries to protect the right to use public footpaths, including the Ramblers Association and the Open Spaces Society in England. Footpaths are now also found in botanic gardens, arboretums, regional parks, conservation areas, wildlife gardens, and open-air museums. There are also educational trails, themed walks, sculpture trails and historic interpretive trails.

==Rights of way==
In England and Wales, public footpaths are rights of way on which pedestrians have a legally protected right to travel. Other public rights of way in England and Wales, such as bridleways, byways, towpaths, and green lanes are also used by pedestrians. In Scotland there is no legal distinction between a footpath and a bridleway and it is generally accepted that cyclists and horse riders may follow any right of way with a suitable surface. The law is different in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and there are far fewer rights of way in Ireland as a whole (see Keep Ireland Open).

===Definitive path maps===
Footpaths and other rights of way in England and Wales are shown on definitive maps. A definitive map is a record of public rights of way in England and Wales. In law it is the definitive record of where a right of way is located. The highway authority (normally the county council, or unitary authority in areas with a one-tier system) has a statutory duty to maintain a definitive map, though in national parks the national park authority usually maintains the map. The Inner London boroughs are exempt from the statutory duty though they have the powers to maintain a map: currently none does so.

Currently, the number of footpaths in the UK totals 427,301 (around 81% of all rights of way) with a net combined route length of 105,125 miles.

In Scotland different legislation applies and there is no legally recognised record of rights of way. However, there is a National Catalogue of Rights of Way (CROW), compiled by the Scottish Rights of Way and Access Society (Scotways), in partnership with Scottish Natural Heritage, and the help of local authorities.

===Open Spaces Society===

The Open Spaces Society is a charitable British organisation that works to protect public rights of way and open spaces in the United Kingdom, such as common land and village greens. It is Britain&#x27;s oldest national conservation body. The society was founded as the Commons Preservation Society and merged with the National Footpaths Society in 1899, and adopted their present name.

Much of the Open Spaces Society&#x27;s work is concerned with the preservation and creation of public paths. Before the introduction of definitive maps of public paths in the early 1950s, the public did not know where paths were, and the Open Spaces Society helped the successful campaign for paths to be shown on Ordnance Survey maps. It advises the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and National Assembly for Wales on applications for works on common land. Local authorities are legally required to consult the society whenever there is a proposal to alter the route of a public right of way.

The Ramblers are another British organisation concerned with the protection of footpaths.

==Urban footpaths==
There are a variety of footpaths in urban settings, including paths along streams and rivers, through parks and across commons. Another type is the alley, normally providing access to the rear of properties or connecting built-up roads not easily reached by vehicles. Towpaths are another kind of urban footpath, but they are often shared with cyclists. A typical footpath in a park is found along the seawall in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This is a segregated path, with one lane for skaters and cyclists and the other for pedestrians.

In the US and Canada, where urban sprawl has begun to strike even the most rural communities, developers and local leaders are currently striving to make their communities more conducive to non-motorized transportation through the use of less traditional paths. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has established the Active Living by Design program to improve the livability of communities in part through developing trails, The Upper Valley Trails Alliance has done similar work on traditional trails, while the Somerville Community Path and related paths, are examples of urban initiatives. In St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada The Grand Concourse, is an integrated walkway system that has over of footpaths which link every major park, river, pond, and green space in six municipalities.

In London, England, there are several long-distance walking routes which combine footpaths and roads to link green spaces. These include the Capital Ring, London Outer Orbital Path and the Jubilee Walkway, the use of which have been endorsed by Transport for London.

===Alley and steps===

An alley is a narrow, usually paved, pedestrian path, often between the walls of buildings in towns and cities. This type is usually short and straight, and on steep ground can consist partially or entirely of steps. In older cities and towns in Europe, alleys are often what is left of a medieval street network, or a right of way or ancient footpath. Similar paths also exist in some older North American towns and cities. In some older urban development in North America lanes at the rear of houses, to allow for deliveries and garbage collection, are called alleys. Alleys may be paved, or unpaved, and a blind alley is a cul-de-sac. Some alleys are roofed because they are within buildings, such as the traboules of Lyon, or when they are a pedestrian passage through railway embankments in Britain. The latter follow the line of rights-of way that existed before the railway was built.

Because of topography, steps (stairs) are the predominant form of alley in hilly cities and towns. This includes Pittsburgh (see Steps of Pittsburgh), Cincinnati (see Steps of Cincinnati), Portland, Oregon, Seattle, and San Francisco in the United States, as well as Hong Kong, and Rome.

==Long-distance paths==

Footpaths (and other rights of way) have been combined, and new paths created, so as to produce long-distance walking routes in a number of countries. These can be rural in nature, such as the Essex Way, in southern England, which crosses farmland, or urban as with various routes in London, England, or along a coastline like the South West Coast Path in the West of England, or in the high mountains, like the Pacific Crest Trail in the US, which reaches at Forester Pass in the Sierra Nevada.

==Maintenance==

Many footpaths require some maintenance. Most rural paths have an earth or grass surface with stiles, and or gates, including kissing gates. A few will have stepping stones, fords, or bridges.

Urban footpaths may be constructed of masonry, brick, concrete, asphalt, cut stone or wood boardwalk. Crushed rock, decomposed granite, fine wood chips are also used. The construction materials can vary over the length of the footpath and may start with a well constructed hard surface in an urban area, and end with an inexpensive soft or loose surface in the countryside.

Stairs or steps are sometimes found in urban alleys, or cliff paths to beaches.

==Issues==
The main issues in urban areas include maintenance, litter, crime, and lighting after dark. In the countryside there are issues relating to conflicts between walkers and livestock, and these occasionally result in people being injured or even killed. Dogs often contribute to such conflicts – see in England and Wales The Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953. Also footpaths in remote locations can be difficult to maintain and a route along a country path can be impeded by ploughing, crops, overgrown vegetation, illegal barriers (including barbed wire), damaged stiles, etc.

===Confrontation with landowners in the UK===

There have been numerous problems over the years in England and Wales with landowners.

One notable example was with the millionaire property tycoon Nicholas Van Hoogstraten who had a long-standing dislike of and dispute with ramblers, describing them as &quot;scum of the earth&quot;. In 1999 Hoogstraten erected a large fence across a footpath on his country estate in East Sussex. Local ramblers staged a protest against the erection of the fence outside the boundary of Van Hoogstraten&#x27;s estate. On 10 February 2003 and after a 13-year battle and numerous legal proceedings, the path was finally re-opened.

====Isle of Man====
Another conflict involved Jeremy Clarkson, a TV presenter and &quot;Top Gear&quot; host who lives on the Isle of Man. He became frustrated at the lack of privacy at his home when ramblers deviated from a pathway to take photographs of his dwelling. Clarkson&#x27;s property bordered a small 250-metre strip of land that had no definitive status as a public right of way but was used by walkers regardless. Clarkson aimed to close access to this small strip of his land, thereby forcing ramblers to take a small diversion to stick to the official public right of way and therefore protecting his claimed right to privacy on his own property. In May 2010 the former transport minister, Hon. David Anderson MHK, accepted the conclusions of a public inquiry that all except five of the paths claimed at the inquiry as public rights of way have been dedicated as public rights of way and should be added to the definitive map.

<text>The Hellenic Statistical Authority ( ), known by its acronym ELSTAT (), is the national statistical service of Greece.

The purpose of ELSTAT is to produce, on a regular basis, official statistics, as well as to conduct statistical surveys which:
* cover all the fields of activity of the public and private sector,
* underpin the processes for decision making, policy drawing and evaluating the policies of the Government and the public administrations and services (evaluation indicators),
* are submitted to international agencies in compliance with the obligations of the country and
* concern the general public or specific categories of users of statistics in Greece and abroad

In accordance with its establishing law, ELSTAT is an independent authority and it is not subject to the control of any governmental bodies or other administrative authority. Its operation is subject to the control of the Hellenic Parliament.

== History ==
The agency was originally established as the National Statistical Service of Greece (Εθνική Στατιστική Υπηρεσία Ελλάδος) in 1956 by Legislative Decree 3627/1956. In 1986, Presidential Decree 224/1986 it was transformed into the General Secretariat of the National Statistical Service of Greece and became part of the Ministry of National Economy. Law 2392/1996 provided for the arrangement of issues concerning the access of the General Secretariat of the National Statistical Service of Greece to administrative sources and files, as well as statistical confidentiality issues.

On 20 October 2009, the new finance minister in the newly elected Cabinet of George Papandreou announced that Greece&#x27;s budget deficit was expected to reach ~12.5% of GDP. On 8 January 2010, the European Commission published its report &#x27;Report on Greek government deficit and debt statistics&#x27;.

On 23 April 2010 Prime Minister George Papandreou formally requested an international bailout for Greece. The European Union (EU), European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed to participate in the bailout. On 2 May 2010, the IMF, Papandreou, and other Eurozone PMs agreed to the first bailout package for €110 billion ($143 billion) over 3 years. The third austerity package was announced by the Greek government.

As recommended by Eurostat, ESYE was dissolved and replaced by ELSTAT in July 2010 via Law 3832/2010 (amended since by Laws 3842/2010, 3899/2010, 3943/2011, 3965/2011, 4047/2012 and 4072/2012).

==Overview== 
The Hellenic Statistical Authority collects data pertaining to the population (it is responsible for the conduct of the population census, every 10 years), health and social security, employment and unemployment, education, etc. The statistical data collected by ELSTAT are used by both the Greek State and international organisations (such as UNESCO, the UN, OECD), by enterprises, the scientific community, citizens and others.

ELSTAT employs 740 people working in the central office and in 50 Regional Statistical Offices located in various regions of Greece. The registered office of ELSTAT is in the Municipality of Piraeus.

==Management==
The President of ELSTAT is Dr Athanasios C. Thanopoulos, who was unanimously proposed for the position of the President by an international Committee of Experts. He assumed the responsibilities of the President of the Hellenic Statistical Authority in February 2016, by virtue of a decision issued by the Minister of Finance.

<doc id="312689" wikidata="Q241638" url="?curid=312689" title="Silvia Cartwright">
<text>Dame Silvia Rose Cartwright (née Poulter; born 7 November 1943) is a New Zealand jurist who served as the 18th Governor-General of New Zealand, from 2001 to 2006. She was the second woman to hold the office, after Dame Catherine Tizard.

==Early life==
Cartwright is a former student at Otago Girls&#x27; High School, and is a graduate of the University of Otago, where she gained her Bachelor of Laws degree in 1967.

==Public life==

===Legal career===
In 1989, Cartwright became the first female Chief District Court Judge, and in 1993 she was the first woman to be appointed to the High Court.

Cartwright presided over a 1988 inquiry into issues related to cervical cancer and its treatment at Auckland&#x27;s National Women&#x27;s Hospital, known as the Cartwright Inquiry. Cartwright has previously served on the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and played a major role in the drafting of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

In 2007, in recognition for Cartwright&#x27;s work as a lawyer, the Auckland Women Lawyers&#x27; Association established a lecture known as the Dame Silvia Cartwright Lecture Series.

===Governor-General of New Zealand===
Cartwright&#x27;s term as Governor-General of New Zealand was from 4 April 2001 to 4 August 2006. She was succeeded by Anand Satyanand at midday on 23 August 2006. During the intervening period, Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias was the Administrator of the Government (acting governor-general).

On 16 June 2002, Cartwright made a speech at the Annual General Meeting of Save The Children&#x27;s New Zealand branch, in which she criticised section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961, which allowed parents to use &quot;reasonable force&quot; to discipline their children. A number of groups criticised this position, such as the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards – the Monarchist League stated that these comments were &quot;overstepping the mark&quot; for a representative of the Queen, while Green Party MP Sue Bradford welcomed the comments.

On 12 August 2002, in a speech at the opening of the Specialised Applied Research Centre of the Victoria University of Wellington, Cartwright questioned whether longer sentences would reduce criminal reoffending rates. This was after the Sentencing Act 2002 and the Parole Act 2002 were passed – Acts for which Cartwright granted Royal Assent on 12 July 2002. The Acts introduced mandatory sentences for criminal convictions, and reduced the likelihood of parole. ACT New Zealand MP Stephen Franks was critical of the remarks, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think she was regarded as one of the most weighty judges and she&#x27;s putting herself into a difficult constitutional position by weighing in this area&quot;, as was the Sensible Sentencing Trust. However, Prime Minister Helen Clark defended the governor-general, stating &quot;One of the challenges for us is we clearly are no longer a dominion of Britain where the Governor-General is exactly like the Queen&quot;.

On Waitangi Day 2004, following National leader Don Brash&#x27;s controversial Orewa Speech on race relations, Cartwright controversially gave a different interpretation of the phrase &quot;He iwi tahi tatou&quot;.

Following the 2005 general election, former National deputy leader Gerry Brownlee stated that Cartwright had not allowed National the chance at forming a government. Brownlee said &quot;I have to publicly say that I have lost respect for the Governor-General and I think it is time we sat down now and started to look at a much more formal constitution for New Zealand&quot;. In response, Helen Clark said that the governor-general followed a &quot;very, very proper process&quot;.

===Cambodian War Crimes Tribunal===
Cartwright was appointed to sit as one of two international judges in the Trial Chamber of the Cambodia Tribunal by Cambodia&#x27;s Supreme Council of Magistracy. Multiple Defence requests that she stand down from this position have been consistently rejected by both the Trial Chamber and Supreme Court Chambers on their merits.

==Honours and awards==

In the 1989 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Cartwright was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to women. Upon her retirement from the High Court, she was granted the use of the style &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life. In 1990, Cartwright received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and in 1993 she was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. She was made a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2001, and she was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Service Order at the State luncheon at Parliament to farewell her on 2 August 2006.

In the 2022 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Platinum Jubilee Honours, Cartwright was appointed an additional Member of the Order of New Zealand, for services to New Zealand.

Cartwright is an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation and a fellow of the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institution in the United States.

<doc id="312694" wikidata="Q234533" url="?curid=312694" title="Cornelia (mother of the Gracchi)">
<text>Cornelia (c. 190s – c. 115 BC) was the second daughter of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, a Roman general prominent in the Second Punic War, and Aemilia Paulla. Although drawing similarities to prototypical examples of virtuous Roman women, such as Lucretia, Cornelia puts herself apart from the rest because of her interest in literature, writing, and her investment in the political careers of her sons. She was the mother of the Gracchi brothers, and the mother-in-law of Scipio Aemilianus.

== Biography ==
Cornelia married Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, grandson of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, when he was already in middle age. The union proved to be a happy one, and together they had 12 children, which is very unusual by Roman standards. Six of them were boys and six were girls. Only three are known to have survived childhood: Sempronia, who married her cousin Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, and the two Gracchi brothers (Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus), who would defy the political institutions of Rome with their attempts at popular reforms.

After her husband&#x27;s death, she chose to remain a widow while still enjoying a princess-like status and set herself to educating her children. She even refused the marriage proposal of King Ptolemy VIII Physcon because she is made to be a virtuous and dutiful wife after the death of her only husband. However, her refusal could simply be justified by the fact that she had a desire for more independence and freedom in the manner in which her children were to be raised.

Later in her life, Cornelia studied literature, Latin, and Greek. Cornelia took advantage of the Greek scholars she brought to Rome, notably the philosophers Blossius (from Cumae) and Diophanes (from Mytilene), who were to educate young men. She had been taught the importance of receiving an education and came to play an extensive role in her sons&#x27; education during the &quot;bygone republican era,&quot; resulting in the creation of a &quot;superior breed of Roman political leader.&quot; Cornelia always supported her sons Tiberius and Gaius, even when their actions outraged the conservative patrician families in which she was born. She took a lot of pride in them, comparing her children to &quot;jewels&quot; and other precious things, according to Valerius Maximus.

After their violent deaths, she retired from Rome to a villa in Misenum but continued to receive guests. Her villa saw the likes of many learned men, including Greek scholars, who came from all over the Roman world to read and discuss their ideas freely. Rome worshipped her virtues, and when she died at an advanced age, the city voted for a statue in her honor.

== Role in the political careers of her children==
It is important to note that M. I. Finely advances the argument that &quot;the exclusion of women from any direct participation in political or governmental activity&quot; was a normal practice in Ancient Roman society. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to characterize the extent of Cornelia&#x27;s involvement in the political careers of her children, yet there is important evidence to support the fact that she was, at the very least, engaged.

A common social practice in Rome was extending the political line of a family through dynastic marriages, especially when two families were rising to power at about the same time. The marriage of Sempronia (Cornelia&#x27;s daughter) to her cousin reaffirmed the continuation of the great Scipio lineage, seeing as though the legacy of Scipio Africanus had to be continued somehow. Scipio Aemilianus saw important growth in his political prestige as a result of this marriage, although not enough to compare to his brothers-in-law and their revolutionary political reforms.

One of the most important aspects of the life of Cornelia is her relationship with her adult sons. Most of the information that we have on her role during this time is what Plutarch wrote in both the &quot;Life of Tiberius Gracchus&quot; and the &quot;Life of Gaius Gracchus&quot;. She is portrayed as active during their political careers, especially during Gaius’.

Plutarch writes of how Gaius removed a law that disgraced Marcus Octavius, the tribune whom Tiberius had deposed, because Cornelia asked him to remove it. Plutarch states that the people all approved of this out of respect for her (due to her sons and her father). Plutarch also writes that Cornelia may have helped Gaius undermine the power of the consul Lucius Opimius by hiring foreign harvesters to help provide resistance (which suggests that harvesters were supporters of the Gracchi).
Plutarch also writes that, when one of Gaius&#x27;s political opponents attacked Cornelia, Gaius retorted:
&quot;What,&quot; said he, &quot;dost thou abuse Cornelia, who gave birth to Tiberius?&quot; And since the one who had uttered the abuse was charged with effeminate practices, &quot;With what effrontery,&quot; said Gaius, &quot;canst thou compare thyself with Cornelia? Hast thou borne such children as she did? And verily all Rome knows that she refrained from commerce with men longer than thou hast, though thou art a man.&quot;
This remark suggests that the Gracchi used their mother&#x27;s reputation as a chaste, noble woman to their advantage in their political rhetoric.

==Cornelia&#x27;s letter excerpts==

The manuscripts of Cornelius Nepos, the earliest Latin biographer (ca. 110-24 BC), include several excerpts from a letter supposedly composed by Cornelia to Gaius (her younger son). If the letters are authentic, they would make Cornelia one of only four Roman women whose writings survive to the present day, and they would show how Roman women wielded considerable influence in political families. Additionally, this would make Cornelia the first woman in her own family who wrote and passed down the importance of writing to her posterity. The letters may be dated to just before Gaius&#x27; tribunate in 122 BC (Gaius would be killed the following year in 121 BC, over a decade after the death of his brother Tiberius in 133 BC). The wording in the letter is very interesting, insomuch as it uses the first person, is very assertive and displays copious amounts of raw emotion, which may have been new and unusual for a woman writing at that time, particularly to a man of such important social standing. The two excerpts read as follows:

&quot;You will say that it is a beautiful thing to take on vengeance on enemies. To no one does this seem either greater or more beautiful than it does to me, but only if it is possible to pursue these aims without harming our country. But seeing as that cannot be done, our enemies will not perish for a long time and for many reasons, and they will be as they are now rather than have our country be destroyed and perish.

I would dare to take an oath solemnly, swearing that, except for those who have murdered Tiberius Gracchus, no enemy has foisted so much difficulty and so much distress upon me as you have because of the matters: you should have shouldered the responsibilities of all of those children whom I had in the past, and to make sure that I might have the least anxiety possible in my old age; and that, whatever you did, you would wish to please me most greatly; and that you would consider it sacrilegious to do anything of great significance contrary to my feelings, especially as I am someone with only a short portion of my life left. Cannot even that time span, as brief as it is, be of help in keeping you from opposing me and destroying our country? In the final analysis, what end will there be? When will our family stop behaving insanely? When will we cease insisting on troubles, both suffering and causing them? When will we begin to feel shame about disrupting and disturbing our country? But if this is altogether unable to take place, seek the office of tribune when I will be dead; as far as I am concerned, do what will please you, when I shall not perceive what you are doing. When I have died, you will sacrifice to me as a parent and call upon the god of your parent. At that time does it not shame you to seek prayers of those gods, whom you considered abandoned and deserted when they were alive and on hand? May Jupiter not for a single instant allow you to continue in these actions nor permit such madness to come into your mind. And if you persist, I fear that, by your own fault, you may incur such trouble for your entire life that at no time would you be able to make yourself happy.&quot;

In the early 40s BC, Cicero, Nepos&#x27;s contemporary, referenced Cornelia&#x27;s letters. Cicero portrayed his friend Atticus as arguing for the influence of mothers on children&#x27;s speech by noting that the letters&#x27; style appeared to Atticus to show that the Gracchi were heavily influenced by Cornelia&#x27;s speech more than by her rearing. Later in history, Marcus Fabius Quintilian (ca. 35- ca. 100) would reassert Atticus&#x27;s view of Cornelia&#x27;s letters when he said &quot;we have heard that their mother Cornelia had contributed greatly to the eloquence of the Gracchi, a woman whose extremely learned speech also has been handed down to future generations in her letters&quot; (Inst. Orat. 1.1.6).4

While Cicero&#x27;s reference to Cornelia&#x27;s letters make it clear that elite Romans of the time period were familiar with Cornelia&#x27;s writings, today&#x27;s historians are divided about whether today&#x27;s surviving fragments are authentically Cornelia&#x27;s words. Instead, the fragments are likely to have been propaganda circulated by the elite optimate faction of Roman politics, who were opposed to the populist reforms of Cornelia&#x27;s sons. The letters appear to present Cornelia (a woman with considerable cultural cachet) as opposed to her son&#x27;s reforms, and Gaius as a rash radical detached from either the well-being of the Roman Republic or the wishes of his respected mother—meaning that the surviving fragments could either be outright contemporary forgeries or significantly altered versions of what Cornelia actually wrote.

==The Cornelia statue==
After her death, a marble statue of Cornelia was erected, but only the base has survived; it is &quot;the first likeness of a secular Roman woman set up by her contemporaries in a public space&quot;. Her statue endured during the revolutionary reign of Sulla, and she became a model for future Roman women culminating with the portrait said to be of Helena, Emperor Constantine&#x27;s mother, four hundred years later. Later, anti-populist conservatives filed away the reference to her sons and replaced it with a reference to her as the daughter of Africanus rather than the mother of the Grachii.

== Changing legacy over time ==

The historical Cornelia remains somewhat elusive. The figure portrayed in Roman literature likely represents more what she signified to Roman writers than an objective account. This significance changed over time as Roman society evolved, in particular the role of women. The problems in interpreting the literature are compounded by the fact only one work allegedly attributed to Cornelia herself survives, and classicists have questioned its authenticity since the nineteenth century. The &quot;Cornelia Fragments&quot;, detailed above, purport to constitute what remains of a letter written in 124 BC to her son, Gaius, and were preserved later in the manuscripts of Cornelius Nepos, who wrote on the Gracchi. In the letter, Cornelia expresses strong opposition to Gaius’ intentions to stand for the tribunate. She also urges him not to continue the revolutionary policies of his older brother Tiberius Gracchus, which led ultimately to his death. The fragments were likely included in Nepos’ &quot;Life of Gaius Gracchus&quot;, now lost.

Controversy over the &quot;Fragments&quot;’ authenticity has focused on the letter’s style and content. While a consensus seems to agree that the fragments do resemble the writing style and language of an educated Roman aristocrat of the late second century BC, several observe Cornelia’s rebuking of Gaius’ policies in the letter seems to conflict what is understood about her positions preserved in other sources. The vehemence with which she addresses Gaius seems to conflict, to some scholars, with what is believed regarding her maternal devotion. Because of these doubts, some scholars hypothesize the &quot;Fragments&quot; constitute either a later forgery created by someone wishing to separate Cornelia&#x27;s political ideologies from those of her sons, while others suggest they are a much later fabrication, representing a &quot;rhetorical exercise&quot; wherein the writer attempted to recreate what Cornelia might have said, and the letter was inadvertently included as legitimate source material in Aemilius Probus’ edition of Nepos’ works in the 5th century AD. These theories themselves prove problematic, as the letter constitutes only one data point, and are therefore insufficient in reconstructing broad conclusions about Cornelia&#x27;s political ideals or making inferences about nebulous ideas of &quot;maternal devotion.&quot; As has also been pointed out, if they do in fact represent the work of a forger, he was an expert in the grammar, language, and writing style of the late 2nd century Roman elite. A majority seems to believe that the &quot;Fragments&quot; are authentic and represent a private letter written by a highly educated woman, who never intended her stern rebuke to be read by anyone but her son.

With the &quot;Fragments&quot; being the only primary source material produced by Cornelia that survive, the reconstruction of the historical Cornelia relies mainly on how later Roman writers saw her. This is problematic because Roman depictions of Cornelia clearly change over time. The earliest image of Cornelia, painted largely by Plutarch&#x27;s views, is of an aristocratic woman, spending much of her time living extravagantly in her family&#x27;s villa, who because of her family&#x27;s wealth, opportunities, and interest in education (particularly Greek), receives the best-possible education in Latin and Greek rhetoric. She is somewhat controversial, both for her sons’ political policies and for having developed (and frequently making use of) such strong rhetorical abilities, despite being a woman. These early accounts emphasize her education and abilities but place comparatively much less emphasis on her maternal role.

Over subsequent centuries Cornelia evolved in the eyes of Roman writers, and her memory was adapted to fit their agendas. Her educational achievement and abilities were de-emphasized in favor of her example of &quot;idealized maternity.&quot; Her education was incorporated into her role as mother: education in order to pass it on to her sons. She was excised from the political controversy that surrounded her family and transformed into a heroic figure. As historian Emily Hemelrijk concludes, &quot;the Cornelia we know is to a high degree a creation of later times.&quot;

== Modern representations ==

An anecdote related by Valerius Maximus in his &quot;Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri IX&quot; (IV, 4, &quot;incipit&quot;) demonstrates Cornelia&#x27;s devotion to and admiration for her sons. When women friends questioned Cornelia about her mode of dress and personal adornment, which was far more simple and understated than was usual for a wealthy Roman woman of her rank and station, Cornelia indicated her two sons and said, &quot;haec ornamenta mea [sunt]&quot;, i.e., &quot;These are my jewels.&quot;

Cornelia also serves as the feminine personification of the State of Ohio. A prominent statue of her carries the iconic phrase attributed to her, &quot;These are my jewels&quot;, as its title and has stood on the grounds of the Statehouse for most of its history. This installation, which is often simply called &quot;Ohio&#x27;s Jewels&quot; was completed by Levi Scofield in 1894 and features the Roman matron standing alone on an elevated on a platform gesturing to the seven men who occupy less-conspicuous areas around her feet. Each man possess a deep connection to the State and its essential service in the Civil War effort on the Union&#x27;s behalf. Collectively, these men are the subject of her affectionate comment, standing in place of her sons (she, herself, standing in place of the State). It was first displayed at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, an event that&#x27;s own name paid homage to the popular personification of the United States.

Cornelia, as Cornelia Gracchi, is also gilded on the Heritage Floor, of Judy Chicago&#x27;s iconic feminist artwork, &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (1974–1979).

==Battle==

The French advance guard caught up with Josef Vukassovich&#x27;s Austrian rear-guard at about 9 am on 10 May and after a clash followed them towards Lodi. Vukassovich was soon relieved by Gerhard Rosselmini&#x27;s covering force near the town. The town&#x27;s defences were not strong, the defenders were few, and the French were able to get inside and make their way towards the bridge. The span was defended from the far bank by nine battalions of infantry arrayed in two lines and fourteen guns. The Austrian general in command at Lodi, Sebottendorf, also had four squadrons of Neapolitan cavalry at his disposal, giving him a total of 6,577 men, who were mostly completely exhausted after a hasty forced march. Sebottendorf decided that it was inadvisable to retire in daylight, and opted to defend the crossing until nightfall.

According to French grenadier François Vigo-Roussillon, the Austrians had men attempting to destroy the bridge but the French stopped their efforts by bringing up guns to fire along its length. It should have been fairly easy to prevent a French crossing because the bridge was wooden and could have been burnt. The bridge was about 200 yards long and was simply constructed with wooden piles driven into the river bed every few yards with beams laid to form a roadway.

The French advance guard was not strong enough to try to cross the bridge so several hours passed as additional French forces arrived. That afternoon, French artillery arrived and the heavy guns were positioned to fire across the river. With the heavy guns in place, a violent cannonade began to pound the Austrian positions across the river. It has been suggested that Bonaparte was personally involved in directing some of the guns and that his troops began to refer to him as &quot;le petit caporal&quot; (the little corporal) because of this. However, there is no contemporary evidence to back this up.

After bombarding the Austrian positions for several hours, at about 6 pm the French prepared to attack. Marc Antoine de Beaumont&#x27;s cavalry was sent to ford the river upstream while the 2nd battalion of carabiniers (elite light infantry) was readied inside the walls of the town for an assault onto the bridge itself. The carabiniers stormed out of the gates and onto the bridge. Vigo-Roussillon tells us that the enemy artillery fired one salvo when the troops were part-way across, causing numerous casualties, at which point the column wavered and stopped. It was then that a number of senior French officers, including André Masséna, Louis Berthier, Jean Lannes, Jean-Baptiste Cervoni, and Claude Dallemagne, rushed to the head of the column and led it forward again. (Some authorities suggest that the French retreated and attacked again, but an important Austrian source supports the thesis of a single attack.)

As the French column pushed forward over the bridge, some French carabiniers climbed down the bridge pilings and waded through the river firing as they went. The Austrian troops, already exhausted from hours of marching and fighting without food and presumably demoralised by the French cannonade, were likely concerned that the French cavalry was in position to cut them off from the main Austrian army. The Austrian morale collapsed as the carabiniers rushed towards them and a hasty retreat ensued. The remaining Austrian soldiers made the most of the gathering darkness to make their escape towards Crema though some units maintained a dogged rearguard action thus discouraging the French from pursuing too closely. Oberst Count Attems of &quot;Terzi&quot; Infantry Regiment # 16 was killed covering the successful, though costly withdrawal.

Austrian losses were 21 officers, 5,200 men, and 235 horses killed, wounded, or captured. In addition, 12 cannons, 2 howitzers and 30 ammunition wagons were lost. The French suffered approximately 1,000 casualties.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Lodi was not a decisive engagement since the bulk of the Austrian army managed to escape. Nevertheless, the engagement became a central element in the Napoleonic legend convincing even Napoleon himself that he was superior to other generals and that he was destined to achieve great things.

<doc id="312698" wikidata="Q193506" url="?curid=312698" title="Cato the Younger">
<text>Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (&quot;of Utica&quot;; , ; 95 BC – April 46 BC), also known as Cato the Younger (), was an influential conservative Roman senator during the late Republic. A staunch advocate for liberty and the preservation of the Republic’s principles, he dedicated himself to protecting the traditional Roman values he believed were in decline. A noted orator and a follower of Stoicism, his scrupulous honesty and professed respect for tradition gave him a political following which he mobilised against powerful generals of his day, including Julius Caesar and Pompey.

Before Caesar&#x27;s civil war, Cato served in a number of political offices. During his urban quaestorship in 63 BC, he was praised for his honesty and incorruptibility in running Rome&#x27;s finances. He passed laws during his plebeian tribunate in 62 BC to expand the grain dole and force generals to give up their armies and commands before standing in elections. He also frustrated Pompey&#x27;s ambitions by opposing a bill brought by Pompey&#x27;s allies to transfer the military command to Pompey against the Catilinarian conspirators. He opposed, with varying success, Caesar&#x27;s legislative programme during Caesar&#x27;s first consulship in 59 BC. Leaving for Cyprus the next year, he was praised for his honest administration and after his return was elected as praetor for 54 BC.

He supported Pompey&#x27;s sole consulship in 52 BC as a practical matter and to draw Pompey from his alliance with Caesar. In this, he was successful. He and his political allies advocated a policy of confrontation and brinksmanship with Caesar; though it seemed that Cato never advocated for actual civil war, this policy greatly contributed to the start of civil war in January 49 BC. During the civil war, he joined Pompey and tried to minimise the deaths of his fellow citizens. But after Pompey&#x27;s defeat and his own cause&#x27;s defeat by Caesar in Africa, he chose to take his own life rather than accept what he saw as Caesar’s tyrannical pardon, turning himself into a martyr for and a symbol of the Republic.

His political influence was rooted in his moralist principles and his embodiment of Roman traditions that appealed to both senators and the innately conservative Roman voter. He was criticised by contemporaries and by modern historians for being too uncompromising in obstructing Caesar and other powerful generals. Those tactics and their success led to the creation of the First Triumvirate and the outbreak of civil war. The epithet &quot;the Younger&quot; distinguishes him from his great-grandfather, Cato the Elder, who was viewed by ancient Romans in similar terms as embodying tradition and propriety.

==Early life==

Cato was born in 95 BC, the son of his homonymous father and Livia. He was descended from Cato the Elder – this Cato&#x27;s great-grandfather – who was a &quot;novus homo&quot; (&quot;new man&quot;) and the first of the family to be elected to the consulship. The elder Cato was famed for his austerity and traditional Roman values, which was affected for political reasons and meant to embellish his reputation as &quot;the foremost representative of the &quot;mos maiorum&quot;&quot;.

He and his sister Porcia were orphaned, probably before Cato was four years old, and the children were taken in by their maternal uncle, Marcus Livius Drusus. After Drusus&#x27; death and the resulting start of the Social war in 91 BC, Cato and his sister probably came into the household of his mother&#x27;s older brother, Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus. Moving in with Cato and his sister were a half-brother and two half-sisters from his mother Livia&#x27;s first marriage to Quintus Servilius Caepio. Cato was especially close to his half-brother, Gnaeus Servilius Caepio, and his elder half-sister, Servilia, who would later marry Marcus Junius Brutus (the father of the tyrannicide) and become the mistress of Julius Caesar.

Stories of Cato&#x27;s early childhood are broadly unreliable and told mainly to suggest that Cato&#x27;s character as an adult had been established in childhood. They include claims that Cato was a poor student, a dubious tale that Quintus Poppaedius Silo – one of the Italian leaders during the Social war – once threatened to hang Cato out of a window unless he voiced support for Italian citizenship (Cato supposedly remained silent), and a claim that Cato asked his tutor for a sword with which to assassinate Sulla during Sulla&#x27;s proscription.

Around the age of 16, Cato was inducted into the &quot;quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot;, the board of priests in charge of consulting and interpreting the Sibylline Oracles. This was a prestigious honour, for which he was likely selected on the initiative of his uncle Mamercus Lepdius, and it put Cato into the centre of the senatorial elite.

==Political development==
Shortly after his induction into the &quot;quindecimviri&quot;, he received his inheritance, which immediately made him a wealthy citizen (though modest among the elite). Plutarch reports around this time, he also began to study Stoicism under the philosopher Antipater of Tyre, Epicureanism under a Philostratus, and Peripatetism under a certain Demetrius.

=== Embodying the &quot;mos maiorum&quot; ===

He also started to adopt a pattern of ostentatious public antiquarianism. To that end, he adopted an austere lifestyle where he refused to travel long distances on horseback (preferring to walk), travelled the city barefoot, and wore only a toga without a tunic. His sartorial choices were modelled on statues of Rome&#x27;s legendary founders and heroes, who were depicted wearing togas alone, rather than any philosophical inclinations. These choices were deliberate and political:


His first appearance on the public stage was to oppose changes to the Basilica Porcia, a public building commissioned by his great-grandfather Cato the Elder during his term as censor in 184 BC. The plebeian tribunes proposed moving a column that impeded their view of the Forum. Cato may have been expected to defend the monument – such monuments extolled the families of those who built them – but the column may not have actually been part of the Basilica. Regardless, Cato used the opportunity to enter public life with an appearance defending his family&#x27;s honour and reputation, showing his &quot;pietas&quot;, and connecting himself to his famous ancestor.

=== Marriages and alliances ===

Cato&#x27;s first marriage was early in his twenties. He was first betrothed to his cousin Aemilia Lepida (a daughter of Mamercus Lepidus). The reasons were unclear: because of his close relations to Mamercus Lepidus, the match would not have been very useful politically in building new alliances; he may have been motivated by love or by the large size of the dowry. Aemilia Lepida had previously been betrothed to Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica, but Scipio broke off the match, after which Cato was betrothed. However, some time later, Scipio changed his mind and Lepidus evidently decided that a match with Scipio was more desirable. The two were married shortly after. Cato was angry and threatened a lawsuit against his uncle to enforce the engagement, but was dissuaded by his friends.

He instead married Atilia, the daughter of an Atilius Serranus (the specific identity is unknown). While the &quot;gens Atilia&quot; had consular ancestors, it had not been successful in reaching the consulship after the end of the second century BC. By her, he later had a son, Marcus Porcius Cato, and a daughter, Porcia. Around this time he also secured an excellent marriage for his sister in Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. His half-sisters&#x27; very favourable matches helped develop a strong network of political allies.

=== Military service ===

In 72 BC, Cato volunteered to fight in the war against Spartacus, presumably to support his half-brother Caepio, who was serving as a military tribune in the consular army of Lucius Gellius. Although the army was defeated twice in battle, Cato&#x27;s valour was recognised. Although the consul Gellius recommended Cato for awards, he publicly declined them and indicated that he thought Gellius&#x27; standards for military achievement too low; news of this implicit rebuke made its way back to Rome and buttressed Cato&#x27;s reputation.

A few years later, in 67 BC, he stood for the military tribunate. After winning election, he was dispatched to Macedonia under propraetor Marcus Rubrius, where he earned the respect of the soldiers by sharing their burdens and treating them justly. He insisted on walking, refusing to ride a horse. Over a winter, he travelled to Pergamum and became the patron of a Greek Stoic philosopher named Athenodorus who, contradicting Cato the Elder&#x27;s disdain for Greek philosophers, accompanied Cato back to Rome.

During his service in Macedonia, he received the news that his beloved half-brother Caepio was ill and dying in Thrace. He immediately went to see him but was unable to arrive before his brother&#x27;s death. Cato was overwhelmed by grief and, ignoring Stoic principles of &quot;apatheia&quot; (living without passions), he spared no expense to organise lavish funeral ceremonies. After the end of his military commission, he travelled through Asia Minor and through Galatia. Before returning to Rome, he also visited Pompey, who was then supervising the final stages of the Third Mithridatic War. Cato, according to Plutarch, received an exaggerated and deferential welcome from the proconsul, which most scholars doubt actually occurred.

== Entry to politics ==

Cato returned to Rome in early 65 BC and intended to stand for the quaestorship later that year. He spent substantial time familiarising himself with the laws related to the office – largely on administration of state finances both in Rome and in the provinces – and may have been angling to engage in reforms of state treasury operations. He was easily elected and took office on 5 December 65 BC.

Around this time, Lucullus – one of the wealthiest men in Rome and long-time commander of troops against Mithridates VI Eupator in the Third Mithridatic War – approached him about marrying Cato&#x27;s younger half-sister Servilia. This was likely part of Lucullus&#x27; attempt to win allies in his bid for a triumph against Mithridates, which had been stymied by Pompey&#x27;s supporters, who wanted to permit Pompey (then in Asia) to return and claim all the credit. Cato agreed and after the marriage, during his quaestorship, he helped Lucullus (by this point in the second or third year of campaigning for a triumph) in browbeating his opponents into eventually granting a triumph in 63 BC.

=== Quaestorship (64 BC) ===

Cato was assigned to the state treasury (the &quot;aerarium&quot;) in Rome as one of the urban quaestors. The complexity of Roman financial law and the treasury&#x27;s record-keeping had caused the relatively junior Roman aristocrats to delegate much of the work to the treasury staff, resulting in widespread corruption. Cato started his term by prosecuting a number of the clerks and firing a number of others; even after one was acquitted after intervention from one of the censors, Cato refused to rehire him.

He also started the process of collecting on long-standing state debts and made prompt payments to state creditors. In doing so, he cooperated with Julius Caesar, who had then just completed a term as &quot;curule aedile&quot; and was acting as a prosecutor in court, in challenging the legal immunity and payments given to men who had received bounties for killings during the Sullan proscriptions. He also changed procedures to ensure that the treasury archives rejected fraudulent documents.

On his last day in the &quot;aerarium&quot;, Plutarch reports that he discovered that his old friend and colleague in the urban quaestorship, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, was entering fraudulent records; Cato apparently stormed back to erase them before the end of his term. He also spent an enormous amount of money – some five talents, about four per cent of his inheritance – to make copies of all the treasury archives from Sulla to his own day so that he could keep them on hand.

Cato gained an exemplary reputation for honesty in administering the &quot;aerarium&quot;. According to Plutarch&#x27;s biography, he &quot;taught men that a city can be rich without treating its citizens unjustly&quot; and &quot;brought the quaestorship into greater esteem than the senate, so that everybody thought and said that Cato had given the quaestorship the dignity of the consulship&quot;.

=== Tribunate (62 BC) ===

In 63 BC, Cato stood for the plebeian tribunate of 62 BC. After his election but before his term started in December, he opposed granting additional honours to Pompey, engaged in an unsuccessful prosecution of Lucius Licinius Murena, and took part in a famous debate on the Catilinarian conspiracy.

==== Catilinarian conspiracy ====

Lucius Sergius Catilina, a noble patrician, led a rebellion against the state, raising an army in Etruria. Upon discovery of an associated plot against the lives of the consuls and other magistrates in Rome, Cicero arrested the conspirators within the city and proposed executing them without trial, a violation of citizen rights to appeal. While Cicero could have done this on his own authority (augmented by a &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot;), he convened the senate and put the matter before it, almost certainly to diffuse responsibility. The matter of killing the conspirators was a novel one: while the use of deadly force against citizens under arms was generally accepted, summarily executing prisoners was not.

Cato&#x27;s brother-in-law, Decimus Junius Silanus, who was one of the consuls-elect, spoke first in favour of death, as did the rest of the former consuls. But Julius Caesar, then praetor-elect, countered with a proposal to imprison the conspirators, which started to gain the support of the house. Cato spoke two or three speeches after Caesar. According to Sallust, among other things he argued that the senate was being too soft against enemies of the state, that it was folly to await the ultimate test of the conspirators&#x27; guilt – the overthrow of the state – because the very proof of their guilt would make it impossible to enforce the laws, and that precedent and religious scruples demanded severe action. In Sallust&#x27;s depiction, both Cato and Caesar make appeals to precedent and &quot;mos maiorum&quot;: Caesar calls executing the subdued conspirators &quot;a new type of punishment&quot; and attempted to draw Cato into contradicting his great-grandfather&#x27;s lenient stance on the Rhodians after the Third Macedonian War; Cato viewed executing traitors as consistent with ancient Roman tradition. While Caesar&#x27;s speech – due to the fact he was praetor-elect and would soon assume a presidency of one of the permanent courts – seemed to imply he would as a judge support a prosecution for murder, Cato&#x27;s counter-arguments convinced the senators to act aggressively and decisively by playing on their fears.

Cato and his political allies also saw in the Catilinarian crisis an opportunity to ruin Caesar&#x27;s career, if not have him killed, by falsely incriminating him in it. The famous story of Cato&#x27;s misinterpreting a love letter from Servilia (Cato&#x27;s half-sister and wife of consul-elect Silanus) to Caesar as incriminating evidence comes from this episode; it may, if historical, show how suspicious Cato was of Caesar&#x27;s motives. The source of the enmity was both political and personal: historians speculate various reasons, from political opposition to envy of Caesar&#x27;s social and political success (by this time he had already been elected &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, beating out a family ally) to retaliation for malicious rumours of Caesar&#x27;s having been Cato&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s father or that Caesar was purchasing sexual favours from Servilia&#x27;s daughter. At the same time, it is easy to see contemporary parallels between Caesar and Catiline: Caesar had likely supported Catiline&#x27;s bids for the consulship; Caesar, like Catiline, was buried under massive debts; Caesar too hailed from an ancient patrician clan that had fallen on hard times; and Caesar too would have been forced into exile or bankrupt obscurity if he were to fail in his political career.

==== As tribune ====
Cato&#x27;s first action on entering his tribunate in December 63 BC was to propose a law expanding the grain dole. He brought the bill with the support of the senate late in the year, according to Plutarch, to calm discontent in the city and strengthen the senate&#x27;s political position. The law more than doubled the number of people receiving subsidised grain, placed a considerable burden on the republic&#x27;s finances, and possibly made Cato one of the most generous politicians in the history of the grain dole. His grain bill also showed that the &quot;lex frumentaria&quot; was not the exclusive preserve of the so-called &quot;populares&quot;, but rather, that &quot;the advocacy of corn distribution knew no party&quot;.

One of the other tribunes of the plebs, Metellus Nepos, proposed two bills to grant Pompey additional honours. The first would transfer command of the (nearly completed) campaign against Catiline in northern Italy to Pompey. The second would have allowed Pompey to stand &quot;in absentia&quot; for the consulship of 61 BC and to lead troops into the &quot;pomerium&quot; (the sacred boundary of the city). Cato strongly opposed both. When Nepos initially presented the bill, Cato tried to talk him down as a friend but was unsuccessful, returning to invective after Nepos refused. The senate, at Cato&#x27;s urging, voted down the bills; Nepos moved to bring them before the popular assemblies regardless.

Nepos, along with his ally Caesar, convened the assembly at the Forum before the Temple of Castor and Pollux. Cato and one of his allies, another tribune named Quintus Minucius Thermus, forced their way to the front and Cato then sat between Nepos and Caesar. When Nepos directed the bill to be read, he vetoed it; when Nepos started to read it himself, Cato snatched the draft from his hands; when Nepos started to recite it from memory, Thermus put his hand over Nepos&#x27; mouth to stop him from speaking. A fight accordingly broke out in the Forum. In response to the violence, the senate passed a &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot;; Nepos fled Rome to Pompey in the east and Caesar backed down. Suetonius and Plutarch then assert that Nepos, Caesar, or both were removed from their offices; modern scholars do not believe these assertions, as the senate during the republic had no such powers. More contemporaneous sources imply that the senate may have moved to ratify Nepos&#x27; departure from the city (tribunes were legally forbidden from leaving the city), which Cato likely objected to.

Later, Cato, with another fellow tribune named Lucius Marius, passed a law establishing penalties for military commanders who misrepresented the number of enemies or Roman soldiers killed in battles and required commanders to swear as to the accuracy of the numbers in their reports when returning from campaign. The law may have been aimed at Caesar, who would take up in the following year a governorship in Spain, where he would have opportunities to campaign against the Spanish tribes. Cato may also have been involved in the passage of a law requiring candidates at elections to make their official declarations of candidacy in person before an official within the city; such a law precluded a general from holding a military command and standing for office, as entering the &quot;pomerium&quot; vitiated promagisterial &quot;imperium&quot; (military command authority). This law may have been aimed at Pompey, who was thought to desire another consulship on his return, or Caesar, to force him to choose between the consulship and military glory.

Near the end of 62 BC, a scandal occurred involving Publius Clodius Pulcher&#x27;s sacrilegious intrusion into secret rites to Bona Dea. When Clodius was acquitted on charges of sacrilege, apparently due to jury tampering via bribery, Cato moved to correct a loophole in the law. While the &quot;lex Aurelia&quot; in 70 BC had distributed the jury pool between senators, equestrians, and the &quot;tribuni aerarii&quot;, the anti-graft provisions of then-existing laws applied only to senators, meaning that bribing the non-senatorial jurors was legal. Cato&#x27;s push against bribery was opposed by some of his normal allies, such as Cicero, who believed that it undermined senatorial government in alienating the equestrians, and was eventually dropped.

=== Senatorial leadership ===

Cato was fortunate to emerge into politics when much of the senate was devoid of senior consular leadership. The previous Social War, followed by Sulla&#x27;s civil war and then the proscriptions, had destroyed a great number of senatorial families. Because of the great bloodletting of previous decades and a growing trend toward semi-retirement rather than active political life after leaving office, by 65 BC, the number of active senior leaders – &quot;consulares&quot;, that is, former consuls – in the senate had fallen to just nine. Cato&#x27;s pro-senatorial beliefs and oratorical skills positioned him in taking an active role in leading more conservative senators:

Moreover, his archaic mannerisms also helped him gain influence among the senators and the people. According to Fred Drogula, a classicist, by making &quot;himself into a living example of the old-fashioned Roman... [he] tapped into the deep vein of patriotism and conservatism that ran through the blood of every Roman citizen... disagreeing with [Cato] seemed to be a rejection of Roman tradition and therefore of Rome itself&quot;. His antiquarianism and birth to a family that had produced consuls more than a century into the past also helped win prestige among the senatorial elite.

For Fred Drogula, Cato&#x27;s posturing as &quot;the voice of the ancestors enabled him to push or shame others into agreeing with his opinions&quot;, which also helped to make up for his meagre financial resources in an expensive political environment where large bribes paid to voters was a normal part of campaigning. His principled stands also found themselves well taken in a senate which sought to portray itself as morally upright. It, however, made him a difficult ally or potential ally: he would accept few deviations from what he saw as traditional Roman principles.

By the end of his tribunate, he was remarkably popular among the nobility, especially for such a junior senator with no claims to military victory. He also was instrumental in uniting the senate, even at this earlier stage in his career, against Caesar; his success in his anti-Caesarian politics, however, forced Caesar to adopt more aggressive &quot;popularis&quot; tactics and eventually form his alliance with Pompey and Crassus. In the years after his tribunate, many of the other leading conservative senators died or retired. Cato then assumed a loose leadership of the more conservative wing of senators, further bolstering his influence.

== Before the civil war ==

After his tribunate, Caesar left for Spain and Pompey returned to Rome in February 61 BC. Pompey divorced his wife, Mucia, the half-sister of Metellus Nepos, partly due to her adultery and partly to distance himself from the riots for which Metellus Nepos was blamed, and asked to marry one of Cato&#x27;s nieces. The alliance proposal reflected Cato&#x27;s recognition as a major political player; Cato rejected the offer, indicating that he likely had already made up his mind to oppose Pompey&#x27;s eastern settlements and proposals.

In doing so, he drew a wedge between Pompey and the senate. His anti-Pompeian policy was likely a political error: Pompey was then seeking to reconcile with the senate; Cato&#x27;s refusal forced Pompey to look for alternative allies to provide promised retirement lands to his veterans and secure ratification of his eastern settlements. He first sought to have one of his legates elected as consul for 60 BC: to do this, he distributed enormous bribes among the voters. In response, Cato again championed legislation banning bribery (proposed by a tribune named Marcus Aufidius Lurco), which was defeated, in part because the voters liked receiving payments for their votes. At the elections, Pompey&#x27;s legate was successful, as well as Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, who had become one of Pompey&#x27;s enemies after Pompey&#x27;s divorce of Celer&#x27;s half-sister, Mucia. Celer, along with Cato and Lucullus, then proceeded successfully to obstruct Pompey&#x27;s agenda through the year. In this year, he also opposed a plan to renegotiate &quot;publicani&quot; tax collection contracts in Asia brought by Marcus Licinius Crassus with filibuster tactics, unheedful of alienating the wealthy &quot;publicani&quot;. Cato&#x27;s success in opposing Pompey and Crassus&#x27; agendas forced them to recalculate; for both men, these were vital promises they had made to key supporters.

The return of Caesar from Spain in June of 60 BC forced Caesar too to choose: he either could enter the city and give up his command to stand for the consulship or he would retain the command in hopes for a triumph, per the law passed during Cato&#x27;s tribunate. Caesar requested dispensation from the law from the senate – such dispensations were normal – but Cato proceeded to filibuster the request. In response, Caesar surprisingly gave up his triumph to stand for the consulship. Cato and his allies had tried to disincentivise Caesar&#x27;s campaign by assigning the next year&#x27;s consuls to an unimportant job in Italy. They also sought to get an opponent – Cato&#x27;s son-in-law Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus – elected as Caesar&#x27;s consular colleague, including by ignoring their own anti-bribery positions when matching the enormous bribes paid out by Caesar and his allies. In the end, both Caesar and Bibulus were elected as consuls for 59 BC.

Cato&#x27;s successful opposition to Pompey and Crassus seemed to forebode poorly for Caesar&#x27;s chance on his entrance to the consulship. Faced with this obstructionism and his need to make a success of his consulship, Caesar responded by forming an alliance with Pompey and Crassus, today known as the First Triumvirate. Caesar would play the junior partner and, as a middleman, ensure that Pompey and Crassus (who were themselves rivals) could cooperate.

=== Caesar&#x27;s consulship (59 BC) ===

Caesar&#x27;s consular year started with his bringing a bill before the senate to distribute public lands to poor citizens and Pompey&#x27;s veterans. Well written, brought in the traditional manner, and deferential to the senate&#x27;s prerogatives, Cato lacked any real justification to oppose it; he settled instead for filibustering. For the whole of January, he prevented the senate from acting on the bill and was dragged to prison at Caesar&#x27;s orders before being released. Caesar moved instead to bring the matter before the people.

Bibulus, called to a public debate on the bill, offered no substantive reasons for opposition before exclaiming, in frustration, &quot;You will not have this law this year, not even should you all want it!&quot; Thereafter, Cato and Bibulus entered the forum every morning to declare unfavourable religious omens and preclude a vote, until one morning they were assaulted in the street and driven off, pelted with manure. The bill then passed. Added to Caesar&#x27;s bill was the requirement that senators swear to uphold the law or face punishment; Cato and an ally refused, until Cicero gave a face-saving argument that Cato&#x27;s presence at Rome would serve the republic far more than his exile, leading them to take the oath on the last day before the deadline.

With a sufficient portion of the public on Caesar&#x27;s side after Bibulus&#x27; embarrassing display of obstinate obstructionism and Bibulus&#x27; self-confinement to his home, Caesar moved rapidly to pass further legislation. Over the first half of the year, he passed laws:
* recognising Ptolemy XII Auletes as Egyptian king,
* ratifying Pompey&#x27;s eastern settlements,
* bailing out the &quot;publicani&quot; tax farmers for Crassus, and
* adding Campania to his &quot;lex agraria&quot;.

Cato and his allies continued to resist these bills, but were unsuccessful. Plutarch reports Cato was again dragged to prison for his opposition, but this may be apocryphal. He also opposed the &quot;lex Vatinia&quot; which assigned to Caesar the provinces of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum for five years. Alone, he also opposed Caesar&#x27;s assignment to Transalpine Gaul as well. Cato and his allies may also have engaged in a boycott of public business to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Caesar&#x27;s acts.

Cato, however, supported one bill Caesar brought forth, the &quot;lex Iulia de repetundis&quot;, which detailed specific financial and administrative duties for governors to prevent extortion and embezzlement by provincial governors. His opposition to Caesar&#x27;s legislative programme was likely focused only on those bills which would benefit Caesar personally, which – unlike passing land reform laws – suppressing corruption would not do.

Throughout the consulship, Cato and his allies also produced a substantive amount of propaganda meant to discredit Caesar and his triumviral allies by branding them tyrants, a message reinforced by the violence visited upon Bibulus to secure passage of the agrarian law; the campaign was successful in making it difficult for the three allies to use mob tactics out of fear that they might validate the opposition&#x27;s rumours. The senators cowed into assent to Caesar&#x27;s policies started to filter out of Caesar&#x27;s camp – though this did not mean they became Catonians – leading to another reshuffling of alliances.

=== Cyprus (58 BC) ===

Following Caesar&#x27;s consulship and departure to Gaul, opponents of Caesar started to move to question the legal validity of his legislative actions. They also brought Publius Vatinius, the tribune who had passed the &quot;lex Vatinia&quot; assigning the provinces to Caesar, to stand charges, but the court proceedings were disrupted by a mob led by Publius Clodius Pulcher.

Pulcher had been elected during Caesar&#x27;s consulship as one of the plebeian tribunes of 58 BC. Also in office were a number of triumvirate-friendly magistrates, including both consuls. In March of that year, Clodius promulgated a bill annexing the island of Cyprus. The assignment of governor was initially slated for one of the consuls – Aulus Gabinius, a friend of Pompey, – but after he was unable to take the post, Clodius promulgated a bill to appoint Cato instead as &quot;pro quaestore pro praetore&quot;. Reasons for the appointment are divided: the traditional view is that Clodius wanted Cato away on business; other historians have suggested that doing so was instead an attempt to forge a political alliance or that Cato allowed Clodius to send Cicero into exile for the appointment. Accounts of public reactions to the appointment also were divided: Cicero, for example, praised Cato for accepting it, as, even though Cicero rejected the annexation, he believed Cato to be the right person for the job; on the other hand, Plutarch reports that Cato was forced by law to go. Modern historians also see another reason: there was little productive to do in Rome when triumviral allies controlled all the major magistracies; leaving for Cyprus would allow Cato to buttress his reputation as an honest governor while waiting for the political winds to shift.

After arriving in Cyprus and announcing annexation, the local king – a Roman ally – there killed himself rather than suffer the indignity of deposition. Cato then personally catalogued and solicited bids on all the royal possessions. In doing so, he demonstrated great diligence, but alienated some of his friends in the meantime, receiving them poorly and treating them with suspicion. Cato&#x27;s loss of his account books, low amount recovered from Cyprus, and over-preparation on his return to Rome could indicate that he engaged in some modest embezzlements or allowed his nephew, Marcus Junius Brutus, to engage in usurious moneylending or embezzlement on his behalf. His administration of Cyprus, was, however, well regarded on his reputation for honesty alone. Upon his return, he held a &quot;de facto&quot; glittering naval parade up the Tiber before starting a procession conveying the treasures to the treasury.

=== Return from Cyprus ===

By the time Cato returned from Cyprus, Clodius and Pompey had turned on each other and Cicero had been recalled from exile with Pompey&#x27;s support. Cicero&#x27;s gratitude and debt to Pompey had him support Pompey&#x27;s ambitions: shortly after his return, Cicero proposed a prestigious and wide-ranging grain commission and proposed extraordinarily long &quot;supplicationes&quot; for Caesar&#x27;s Gallic victories. Cato also divorced his loving wife Marcia so he could – with her father&#x27;s consent – marry her to his friend, Quintus Hortensius, in part to cement an alliance.

By 56 BC, the triumviral coalition was faring poorly. With Pompey attacked both by the conservative Cato-aligned senators and by Clodius – who was himself an independent operator – Pompey was forced to double down in his alliance with the other triumvirs. Added was the threat of Caesar&#x27;s replacement in Gaul, setting up the renewal of the triumviral coalition at the Luca Conference: Caesar would, for Pompey, bring Clodius to heel; both Pompey and Crassus would receive prestigious military commands following a dual consulship; and Caesar would be renewed in Gaul. Without the ability to win elections outright, the three allies decided to postpone the elections into the new year, force the election of an &quot;interrex&quot;, and hopefully in the chaos secure consulships for Pompey and Crassus.

The consuls of 56 BC resigned without replacement at the close of their terms; the republic started 55 BC without magistrates. At untimely elections in late January marred by mob violence, Cato supported Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, his brother-in-law. After the triumvirs distributed bribes and used violence to force the other candidates from the elections, Pompey and Crassus were elected consuls for 55 BC and took office immediately. At those elections, Cato stood for the praetorship against Publius Vatinius; he secured support among the initial voters, so Pompey interrupted the elections to give more bribes and remove known Catonian voters. Vatinius was then elected.

At the debate that year about the &quot;lex Trebonia&quot; to grant Crassus the province of Syria so he could fight a war of choice against the Parthian Empire, Cato again repeated his tactic of filibustering until his opponents had him arrested so he could claim to be poorly treated. To avoid a repeat of this embarrassment, at later debates, his attendance was barred by armed mobs. He tried similar obstructive tactics against the &quot;lex Licinia Pompeia&quot; to extend Caesar&#x27;s command, but again failed. At this time, Plutarch reports – if not an injection of imaginative foreshadowing – that Cato moved to split Pompey from Caesar rather than opposing the united triumvirate. At the end of the year, Pompey was to assume his command in Spain but decided against tradition to stay near Rome and govern entirely through his legates.

=== Praetorship (54 BC) ===

Pompey and Crassus&#x27; consulship, while a short-term success, was unsuccessful in the long-run. The elections for the magistrates for 54 BC were a victory for Cato and his allies. Without violence to force a decision in their favour, the electorate reacted coldly to the triumvirs&#x27; favoured candidates. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus – who had stood the previous year – and Appius Claudius Pulcher were elected. Cato was returned for a praetorship and allotted the presidency of the extortion court. Opponents of the triumvirs immediately brought a number of prosecutions against the triumvirs&#x27; allies; almost all were acquitted &quot;in large part because the complex network of connections among senators meant that the litigants could not be reduced to stark choices between two political parties or ideologies&quot;.

One case was that against Aulus Gabinius, who was convicted for receiving a ten thousand talent bribe from Ptolemy XII Auletes to invade Egypt and place him back on the throne. Gabinius was forced into exile. Of the many prosecutions brought against triumviral supporters, Gabinius&#x27; was the only one successful. Cato may also have tendentiously interpreted the jurisdiction of his corruption court so he could push through prosecutions he had yet been unable to do via normal legislation.

Cato also brought legislation to clamp down on electoral bribery by requiring that all candidates submit detailed financial records. But the bill, although passed by the senate, was unpopular among the people and defeated. Bribes for votes were a regular stream of income for many people; shutting down corruption would have been a self-inflicted financial wound. Similarly unpopular was Cato&#x27;s reaction to Caesar&#x27;s victories over the Gauls and Germans. On receipt of reports that Caesar had attacked during a truce but won a victory in which he killed some 430 thousand Germans, Cato objected to it as a sacrilege and demanded Caesar&#x27;s surrender to the Germans. None joined him.

That year also proved that Cato&#x27;s push for stronger anti-bribery legislation had both been a failure and was deeply needed. As interest rates doubled as candidates borrowed to finance bribes, a deal was struck between the two conservative sitting consuls, a triumviral supporter, and a triumviral opponent to pool resources to bribe voters and support the sitting consuls&#x27; assignment to desirable provinces. When one of the participants disclosed the plot to the senate, all were charged with electoral corruption, with the largest loss falling on the consul Domitius (Cato&#x27;s brother-in-law). In response to the scandal, the senate delayed elections for an inquiry, but tribunes started to bring vetoes against various electoral proposals.

=== Chaos ===

Repeated tribunician vetoes prevented elections to be held in 54 for the magistrates for 53 BC. The ancient sources believe that the delays were artificially created to justify the creation of Pompey as dictator, calls which Cato and senators such as Marcus Junius Brutus, strongly opposed. After Cato praised Pompey on his civic-mindedness in publicly refusing a possible dictatorship, the political situation stabilised and two conservative consuls, Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus and Marcus Valerius Messalla Rufus, were elected in July 53 BC. During their truncated terms, they seem only to have tried to pass one bill, to introduce a delay between magistracy and governorship of five years: doing so reduced the ability for consuls to select their own provinces and made it more difficult to borrow money, to be repaid from provincial earnings, by delaying those provincial earnings. Cato was probably one of the co-authors and major supporters of the proposal; it was, however, defeated before the people and panned by younger senators.

While Caesar&#x27;s daughter, Julia, had died the previous year, Pompey&#x27;s support of Caesar continued: he lent a legion from Spain to Gaul at Caesar&#x27;s request (a deal Cato condemned for bypassing the senate and treating public legions as personal property). Also in 53, news arrived of Crassus&#x27; defeat and death at the hands of the Parthians in Syria. While Plutarch reports this made a confrontation between Caesar and Pompey inevitable, their alliance did not immediately break down, even after Pompey&#x27;s marriage to Cornelia Metella.

The year also was rocked with political violence between the duelling mobs led by Clodius and Titus Annius Milo, who also was standing for the consulship. Their months-long clashes, along with tribunician obstruction against the holding of elections, led again to calls for Pompey as dictator. After the year 52 started with no magistrates and Clodius was murdered by Milo after a chance encounter outside of Rome, the level of violence increased; among other things, the senate house and the Basilica Porcia in the Forum was destroyed by fire in Clodius&#x27; makeshift funeral pyre.

=== Pompey&#x27;s sole consulship (52 BC) ===

With a political impasse and anarchy in the streets, Cato and Bibulus proposed making Pompey sole consul (i.e. consul without a colleague). Plutarch and others report that this was to deny Pompey a dictatorship while also establishing a functioning government. Some modern historians, such as John T Ramsey, however, conceive of the choice in political terms: the obstructive tribunes wanted to prosecute Milo for Clodius&#x27; murder, which could not happen if he were elected to the consulship and gained legal immunity. Electing Pompey alone would stabilise the city and, by precluding Milo&#x27;s election, ensure Milo could be brought to trial. While a clear departure from tradition, it allowed Pompey to be brought on side while also restoring order to the city without handing Pompey unlimited power.

Pompey&#x27;s sole consulship was a turning point in the republic. He convened a trial, with the jury intimidated by his soldiers, in which Milo was charged with public disorder. Cato was one of the jurors and two of his allies helped conduct the trial, which may indicate a compromise to bring Milo to trial; Cato made clear his vote for acquittal, but – even with Cicero defending – Milo was condemned regardless. However, Cato had not succeeded in bringing Pompey fully into the senatorial fold: Pompey during his consulship supported the so-called &quot;law of the ten tribunes&quot; which granted Caesar the right to stand for the consulship &quot;in absentia&quot;.

With starting success in forcing a break between Pompey and Caesar, Cato stood for the consulship of 51 BC. He reportedly did so out of a claim of public duty, in the vein of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus being summoned by the people, to defend the republic from Caesar and Pompey. He was defeated after running an austere campaign. Erich Gruen summarises: he &quot;distribute[d] no cash and promise[d] no favours; the campaign seem[ed] to have been designed to win admiration rather than votes&quot;. Cicero complained that while the state needed him, Cato was unwilling or unable to set aside his scruples so to actually win a consular election; after his defeat, Cato did not stand for the consulship again.

==Caesar&#x27;s civil war==

The First Triumvirate had been formed to get around Cato&#x27;s obstructionism. From around 52 BC onwards, Cato tried to separate Pompey from Caesar. For some time, Pompey tried to keep his options open, but was eventually won over that his pre-eminence was incompatible with Caesar&#x27;s rising influence and popularity. Cato continued to arrange opposition to Caesar and continued to spread the view that Caesar was a tyrant-in-making, which by 51 BC became a common view among the senatorial elite. However, by this point, events began to spiral out of Cato&#x27;s control, as the initiative moved towards Cato&#x27;s allies who, unlike Cato, were willing to go to any length to destroy Caesar.

Attempts to recall Caesar from Gaul started in earnest in 51 BC under consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Cato&#x27;s former quaestorian colleague). After Caesar&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Alesia, he argued the rationale for Caesar&#x27;s standing for the consulship &quot;in absentia&quot; was gone and that Caesar&#x27;s &quot;provincia&quot; (here meaning &quot;task&quot;) was complete and, therefore, he and his army should return home. Such attempts were vetoed by Caesar&#x27;s allies in the tribunate and also opposed by Pompey. The next year, 50 BC, the senate was starting to move in earnest to discuss termination of Caesar&#x27;s command; in response, Caesar tried to secure new allies with bribes, including one of the consuls elected for the year, Lucius Aemilius Paullus.

Among Caesar&#x27;s allies was Gaius Scribonius Curio, who cleverly proposed that both Caesar and Pompey should disarm by giving up their commands concurrently; Cato, in a possibly apocryphal outburst related by Plutarch, exclaimed that the proposal was a Caesarian plot to take over the government. Such strong opposition would have been inconsistent with Cato&#x27;s general policy of acting against concentrated power and would in addition have been premature. Regardless, the majority of senators viewed the proposal favourably, as mutual disarmament would bring down tensions and avert a possible civil war. Opposition to Curio&#x27;s proposal highlighted that Pompey&#x27;s term in Spain was still relatively recent, having been granted in 52 BC, making it unjustifiable to strip Pompey of his command so soon. However, the vast majority of the senate (370 to 22) accepted Curio&#x27;s compromise. Cato&#x27;s vote on this important matter is unrecorded, though most historians believe Cato voted against it, probably to pressure Caesar to fold. Some historians, however, such as Helga Botermann, believe that letters from Seneca may suggest that Cato voted in favour.

Cato&#x27;s years of advocacy against Caesar had inculcated a confrontational anti-Caesarian policy among younger senators, hoping that a united senatorial front would force Caesar to fold. The success of his strategy of branding Caesar a tyrant convinced many senators to choose war over negotiations. By the weeks before the start of the war in early January 49 BC, Cato, Pompey, and their allies had hardened their political position to the point where they were unwilling to offer any concessions at all. Cato continued to push Pompey and others to maintain a hard line, rejecting all proposed compromises, in the hope that Caesar would back down. On the 7th of January, 49 BC, the senate was sufficiently frightened and browbeaten to pass a &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; against Caesar, likely under the false pretences that Caesar was already invading.

=== Flight from Italy ===

Caesar did not back down and instead crossed the Rubicon, to Cato&#x27;s surprise. Cato&#x27;s political strategy pushed Caesar into a position where the only way out of political extinction would be civil war. When Caesar chose civil war, Cato&#x27;s demeanour shifted and he quickly started to push for a negotiated settlement. When news of Caesar&#x27;s rapid advance south reached Rome, Pompey made the decision to flee Italy for the eastern provinces and to use the fleet to contain Caesar to Italy before retaking the peninsula.

When Caesar offered peace terms on 23 January that he would be willing to lay down his command and stand for a consulship in person in return for amnesty and Pompey&#x27;s departure to Spain, Cicero relates that Cato strongly supported the plan and forced himself into the war council at which the proposal was discussed. That the peace offers were decisively rejected by the hard-liners who wanted to defeat Caesar militarily indicates that Cato by this point had lost control of his coalition. He attempted to have the senate give Pompey overall command, but the senate chose to divide command among various generals, whom Caesar then defeated in detail.

Pompey assigned Cato to Sicily to raise men and supplies. Pompey may have wanted to keep Cato and his gloomy attitude on the civil war away from the actual fighting. Another reconstruction, however, places Cato at the centre of an abortive strategy to blockade Italy to starve Caesar out by stripping Italy of Sicilian grain supplies. But on 23 April, after being faced with a landing by Gaius Asinius Pollio, he abandoned the island – apparently, according to Cicero, without giving battle, even though his forces were sufficient to resist. Regardless, after further Caesarian landings under Curio, Cato would have been forced to retreat.

=== Greece and Africa ===

After retreating, Cato fled to join Pompey at Dyrrhachium. Upon his arrival there, Plutarch relates that Cato admitted that Cicero&#x27;s more moderate policy, advocating compromise with Caesar, had been correct: &quot;[Cato&#x27;s] distress at the consequences of his own hard-line policies... may have been weigh heavily on him&quot;. He was then sent to Asia Minor to organise transport ships; but finding no need for himself, he induced Rhodes to take Pompey&#x27;s side and left his family there before returning to Pompey in Greece, where he declined command of naval forces, citing Bibulus&#x27; senior consular status. After the indecisive Pompeian victory at the Battle of Dyrrhachium, Cato is said to have been greatly affected by the sight of the casualties.

Cato was not present at the Battle of Pharsalus. He had opposed the proposals that Pompey should chase Caesar down after his withdrawal from Dyrrhachium. Left behind in command at Dyrrhachium, also possibly for political reasons to remove critics (including Cicero) from decision-making following a prospective Pompeian victory, Cato received news of the defeat from Titus Labienus. In the aftermath of the defeat, he decamped to Corcyra and asked Cicero to take command because he still held &quot;imperium&quot; from his promagistracy and was the senior consular present; Cicero declined, preferring instead to return home and seek Caesar&#x27;s pardon. Allowing defectors to leave peacefully, Cato loaded his men and set sail for Egypt via Cyrene. But learning of Pompey&#x27;s death at the hands of the Ptolemies and that Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio was still in command in Africa, he moved to join them. Discovering a fractured situation, he reconciled Metellus Scipio with Publius Attius Varus and had Metellus Scipio put in command. While the recorded reasons were that Cato believed that Metellus Scipio had both consular dignity and a name that would inspire the soldiers, as the inheritor of the &quot;Cornelii Scipiones&quot; that had defeated Hannibal, it is possible that Cato was simply unwilling to lead a fight against fellow citizens.

== Final campaign and death ==
Cato was given command of the city of Utica after convincing Metellus Scipio to spare the town&#x27;s inhabitants when they attempted to defect to Caesar. He successfully expanded the city&#x27;s defences, raised troops, and stockpiled supplies while waiting for Caesar&#x27;s eventual arrival. During his time in Africa, however, Cato became convinced that victory for his own cause under Metellus Scipio would be accompanied by appalling reprisals.

When Cato pushed for a strategy of attrition against Caesar, Metellus Scipio accused Cato of cowardice for being unwilling to risk battle. Around this time, Cato privately confided that the war was hopeless and that he would abandon Rome regardless of the victor. Metellus Scipio ignored Cato&#x27;s relatively pacific advice and engaged in a decisive battle at Thapsus, where his forces were annihilated.

Cato, garrisoning Utica, received news of the defeat three days later, which drove the city into a panic. Knowing that the city would likely defect, Cato evacuated any Roman citizens who wished to flee. He also sent an embassy consisting of his family and allies, headed by one of Caesar&#x27;s kinsmen, Lucius Julius Caesar, to seek pardon for themselves. Cato himself prepared for death.

After righting the city&#x27;s financial accounts and disbursing the remaining monies to the city&#x27;s inhabitants, Cato discussed with his friends at dinner the Stoic belief that a truly free man would never become a slave. After he demanded his sword, which had been removed from his room, his family and friends begged him not to kill himself. Dismissing them, he asked for a report on the ships fleeing the city. Satisfied that all was well, he stabbed himself in the abdomen. The specific details of Cato&#x27;s suicide were greatly embellished after his death, especially in Plutarch&#x27;s account, which states:

Caesar is said to have responded to his death by lamenting that Cato&#x27;s death meant Caesar could not pardon him.

==Legacy and reception==
Cato&#x27;s death triggered a series of eulogies, of which both Cicero and Brutus were authors, starting to identify Cato as a great Stoic philosopher. Caesar responded with an &quot;Anticato&quot;, which has not survived. 

=== Political legacy ===

The traditional political culture of the middle republic was one built around aristocratic compromise, political debate, and reform. The extent of Cato&#x27;s obstruction broke down the traditional republican norms of compromise and discussion; escalation in response to that obstruction proved dangerous to the republic and ran contrary to its ethos. His policies with regard to stopping powerful politicians such as Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus alienated – through its very success – them from the rest of the senatorial class, leading to the formation of their alliance in 59 BC.

Many scholars believe that Cato&#x27;s political strategy before 49 BC contributed significantly in starting the civil war that was the proximate cause of the collapse of the Roman republic, even if he did not intend for conflict. While his strategy – convincing senators that Caesar was a threat to the republic and wanted to make himself king – was successful, that success backfired when those senators then gambled everything on defeating Caesar, whom they saw as an existential threat to liberty, in civil war.

During most of his political career, he consistently obstructed powerful military figures to the fullest extent possible. This uncompromising position had him push strongly, before the civil war, for further confrontation with Caesar, seemingly to pressure Caesar to back down. Cato and his allies also pushed Pompey away from the various olive branches and compromises before the civil war. Up to the last, when Pompey was close to accepting an offer where Caesar would give up all his legions except one and provinces except Illyricum, Cato played on Pompey&#x27;s paranoia by painting Pompey as a Caesarian mark. To the extent that Caesar may have feared prosecution, conviction, and exile – a claim no longer accepted without controversy – Cato was one of the few pushing strongly for Caesar&#x27;s political destruction via prosecution.

Posthumously, Cato&#x27;s opposition to Caesar was cast in predominantly ideological terms, with Cato serving as a heroic symbol of republican values amid its collapse. His life was also appropriated by Augustus as a symbol of republican values. 

Cato&#x27;s commitment to liberty and resistance to tyranny inspired &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot;, a series of 18th-century political essays by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, which played a significant role in shaping Enlightenment political thought and the principles underlying the American Revolution.

=== As a stoic ===
Some scholars point to how Cato acted in ways profoundly inconsistent with Stoic tenets: his anger at the breaking of his betrothal to Aemilia Lepida, breakdown over the death of his half-brother Caepio, his visible despair at the sight of casualties from the civil wars, etc. For such scholars, Cato&#x27;s actions fit into the mould of a traditional Roman acting in line with traditional Roman values rather than Stoic ones. On the other hand, others point out that Cato&#x27;s contemporaries noted his Stoic behaviours and positions explicitly. Cicero lampooned it in &quot;Pro Murena&quot;, and also mentioned it in letters and contemporaneous philosophical texts.

Modern scholars such as Kit Morell note that &quot;the &#x27;Stoic martyr&#x27; tradition has distorted or distracted from the historical Cato&quot;.

<text>Legio III Cyrenaica, ( Third Legion &quot;Cyrenean&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. The legion had its origins among the forces of Mark Antony during the civil wars of late first century BC. In the Imperial period it was stationed in Egypt, where it played a key role in campaigns against the Nubians and Jews. In the first century AD, it was usually located in Arabia Petraea. There are still records of the legion in Syria at the beginning of the 5th century. The legion symbol is unknown.

== History ==

=== Origins and service in Egypt ===
The origins of the legion are unclear, but it is first attested as part of Mark Antony&#x27;s forces during the period of the Second Triumvirate (43-33 BC). Cyrenaica was under the control of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus before 36 BC and of Mark Antony after that date; either of them might have established the Legio III. Pollard and Berry suggest that the legion was established by Lucius Pinarius Scarpus, an ally of Mark Antony who was his governor of Cyrenaica in the 30s BC. The legio III is one of the many legions that appear in Mark Antony&#x27;s Legionary denarii produced in 32-31 BC.

After Augustus defeated Antony at the Battle of Actium in 30 BC and annexed Egypt, he used the legion to occupy Thebes, the main centre in Upper Egypt. The soldiers of this legion are attested worshipping the Egyptian god Ammon. In either 7 AD or 9 AD the legion was transferred to Alexandria.

In 26-25 BC a vexillatio of III Cyrenaica took part in a disastrous Roman attack on Arabia Felix. The campaign was commanded Aelius Gallus, the prefect of Egypt. This caused the province of Egypt to be unprotected, as the legions were off fighting. Because of this the Nubian kingdom of Meroë attacked Upper Egypt. In 24 BC a Roman governor named Gaius Petronius took the legions, one of which was III Cyrenaica, and marched upstream along the Nile and reached Napata, the capital of Nubia. After this, the Nubians attacked the Romans a lot less.

=== Service beyond Egypt ===
On other occasions, vexillationes were sent abroad. It is possible that one of them was sent to Tongeren in Gallia Belgica during the reign of Caligula, which may have been part of the army he wanted to use to invade Britain in 40 AD. Another vexillatio took part Domitius Corbulo&#x27;s campaign against the Parthian Empire in 63 AD. During the First Romano-Jewish war, the Third and Twenty-Second legions fought against the Jews of Alexandria.

In the civil war of the Year of the Four Emperors (69 AD), the III Cyrenaica were among the first supporters of the new emperor Vespasian. This could be because a subunit of the III Cyrenaica took part in the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD.

=== Second century AD ===
In 106 AD the legion was transferred to the province of Arabia Petraea. Its base was at Bosra.
It subsequently returned to Egypt, perhaps in connection with the emperor Trajan&#x27;s war against the Parthians, and/or the rebellion of the Jews of Alexandria in the Kitos War (115-117 AD). The legion returned to Arabia once more after 125 AD. Between 132 AD and 136 AD, subunits of this legion fought against the Jews in the Bar Kokhba revolt. During the reign of Antoninus Pius, they were stationed in Hegra in Arabia, but subunits fought in Mauretania against the Mauri. Later, subunits of the III Cyrenica took part in the Parthian War of Lucius Verus from 162 to 166 AD. In 175 AD, the legion sided with Avidius Cassius, a Roman general who revolted against Marcus Aurelius, but was killed by his own officers.

=== Later history ===
During the civil war following the death of the emperor Commodus in 192 AD the Legio III Cyrenaica sided with the eastern pretender Pescennius Niger. Niger was defeated by Septimius Severus. Subsequently, Severus invaded Mesopotamia to fight against the Parthians and it is possible that the Legio III took part in these campaigns. It certainly participated in the Parthian war launched by Severus&#x27; son Caracalla in 216 AD. The legion may also have taken part in Severus Alexander&#x27;s war against the Sasanian Empire from 231 to 233 In 260 AD, the Sasanians took the Roman emperor Valerian captive, and several Roman provinces in the east became independent under Odaenathus of Palmyra. Odaenathus led Roman units against the Persians, one of which was the III Cyrenica. In 273 AD the legion helped build roads in Jordan. The later history of this unit is unclear, but the third Cyrenaican legion was still at Bostra at the beginning of the fifth century.

== Timeline ==


The following is a list of campaigns and actions thought to have been seen by Legion III Cyrenaica during much of its existence:

*35(?) BC - Leg. III is formed, likely by Mark Antony or Lepidus in Cyrene. At this time, Legions still likely hold to the Republic tradition of being numbered in order of their creation, so this may have been the third Legion that [Anthony] had established and had under his direct command and loyalty.
*31 BC – (Battle of Actium) – Either before or after Anthony and Cleopatra are defeated by Octavian (later Augustus), it is thought soldiers of Leg. III Cyrenaica defect from Anthony and claim allegiance to Octavian - who spares the Legion from being disbanded.
*26 – 25 BC – Action in Arabia Felix (Yemen), commanded by Aelius Gallus, Prefect of Egypt.
*23 BC – Action against Nubian invaders, Elements of III likely stationed in Thebes, Egypt.
*23(?) BC (AD?) - Roman military presence in Egypt is reduced to 2 Legions: III Cyrenaica and XXII Deiotariana. Which other Legions, or how many there were, is not known.
*AD 7 – 11 – Suggested time period that the double-fortress at Nikopolis is established.
*AD 11 – Elements of Leg III under command of Publius Juventius Rufus, stationed in Berenike.
*AD 39 / 40 – A detachment (vexillation) of Leg III was sent up to the northern coast of Gaul (France) to assist Emperor Caligula&#x27;s legions with his rather unimpressive invasion of Britain. III was apparently used as a logistics and supplies organizer for the invasion / landing force.
*AD 58 – 63 – Under the command of Gn. Domitius Corbulo, elements of III saw action in the Parthian frontier.
*AD 66 – 70 – The First Jewish–Roman War. An uprising of Jews starts in Alexandria, and spreads to Judea. Elements of III and XXII fought their way to Jerusalem, and with the assistance of several other legion, auxiliary and allied forces (around 60,000 troops) surrounded and besieged the city, led by Vespasian, Proconsul of Africa.
*AD 69 – &quot;Year of the Four Emperors&quot;. Factions led by Galba, Otho, and then Vitellius all tried to seize control of Rome after the death of Nero. These factions, who had no aristocratic claim to the throne, (and hardly any support of the legions nor the Senate) all tried to take control one after another by force. 
**July 1 – With support of Gaius Licinius Mucianus, Governor of Syria and Tiberius Alexander, Prefect of Egypt, Vespasian is urged to revolt and take the throne. The legions in Alexandria, two days later those of Judea, and then in August those of Syria and the Danube region declare Vespasian Emperor. Vespasian sends Mucianus to march on Rome with 20,000 troops while Vespasian heads to Alexandria to control the grain supply and starve Rome into submission.
**December 22 Vespasian is sworn in as emperor while still in Egypt.
*AD 70 – A vexillation of Leg III, along with X Fretensis, completes the siege of Jerusalem under the command of Vespasian&#x27;s son, Titus.
*AD 84 – 88 – It is believed a detachment of Leg III is sent to help repair a footbridge along the Danube River, with legions VII Claudia, IV Flavia Felix, and either I or II Adiutrix. A stone engraving commemorating the bridge mentions &quot;The Legion from Egypt&quot;. III appears to have been sent out abroad more often than XXII, so it is possible this is referring to III.
*AD 90 – Soldiers of III construct a bridge in Koptos (likely to improve or support roads to ports in Berenike and Quseir).
*AD 107 – 109 – Previously suggested date when Leg III departs Egypt - May instead be elements of III on expeditionary missions into Syria.
*AD 116 – Elements of III (or XXII?) are sent back to Judea to suppress another revolt, known as the Kitos War
*AD 120 or 127 – III makes its departure from Egypt, being relocated to Bosra (aka Bostra, Syria / Jordan), where the capital was renamed from Petra to Nova Trajana Basra honoring Emperor Trajan. While in Bosra, Leg III constructs city gates, bridges and a massive amphitheater, which still exists today and is a popular tourist attraction. Meanwhile, Legion II Trajana Fortis replaces III in Egypt.
*AD 132 – 136 – Yet another Jewish war, the Bar Kokhba revolt. It is thought elements of III and XXII are sent to Judea. Legion XXII may have been destroyed during this war, or perhaps the earlier Kitos War.
*AD 162 – 166 – Elements of III again in Parthia, under command of Lucius Verus.
*AD 193 – Leg III supported Pescennius Niger in his failed attempt to take the throne after Emperor Commodus.
*AD 262 – 267 – It is possible that elements of III were involved with fighting Queen Zenobia in Palmyra (Syria).
*AD 420s or 430s – III is listed in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, a record of Roman military units and their stations. Legion III is listed as &quot;Praefectus legionis tertiae Cyrenaicae, Bostra.&quot;

<text>Legio II Italica (&quot;Italian Second Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army.

==Formation==
Originally having the &quot;cognomen&quot; &quot;Pia&quot;, the legion was raised alongside III &quot;Italica&quot; by emperor Marcus Aurelius when legions sent from the Danube frontier to the East to take part in the Parthian War could not be quickly recalled. There is good evidence to show both legions were raised in AD 165.

==Unit history==
The legion&#x27;s main theatre of operations was the Roman province of Noricum, in the southern margin of the Danube, where Germanic incursions were frequent.

In 180 II &quot;Italica&quot; was stationed in Lauriacum, modern Lorch.

===Year of the five emperors===
In 193, II &quot;Italica&quot; marched into Rome with Septimius Severus, then fighting for power. The new emperor awarded them the title of &quot;Fidelis&quot; (loyal) to acknowledge their support. Later Septimius Severus would use II &quot;Italica&quot; against the rebellions of Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus, as well as in his Parthian campaigns.

===Under Gallienus===
In the 3rd century, support of the legions was of crucial importance to candidates for the throne. Well aware of this fact, Gallienus granted II &quot;Italica&quot; the cognomina &quot;VII Pia VII Fidelis&quot; (seven times faithful, seven times loyal) to secure their continuing support.

===Later service===
There are still records of the II &quot;Italica&quot; in Noricum in the beginning of the 5th century.

==Symbol==
The legion symbol is a she-wolf and the twins Romulus and Remus, a reference to the rule of Marcus Aurelius and his colleague Lucius Verus.

<text>Abramtsevo () is a former country estate and now museum-reserve located north of Moscow, in the proximity of Khotkovo, that became a centre for the Slavophile movement and an artists&#x27; colony in the 19th century. The estate is located in the village of Abramtsevo, in Sergiyevo-Posadsky District of Moscow Oblast. The Abramtsevo Museum-reserve site is an object of cultural heritage in Russia.

==History==

Originally owned by the author Sergei Aksakov, other writers and artists — such as Nikolai Gogol — at first came there as his guests. Under Aksakov, visitors to the estate discussed ways of ridding Russian art of Western influences to revive a purely national style. In 1870, eleven years after Aksakov&#x27;s death, it was purchased by Savva Mamontov, a wealthy industrialist and patron of the arts.

Under Mamontov, Russian themes and folk art flourished there. During the 1870s and 1880s, Abramtsevo hosted a colony of artists who sought to recapture the quality and spirit of medieval Russian art in a manner parallel to the Arts and Crafts movement in Great Britain. Several workshops were set up there to produce handmade furniture, ceramic tiles, and silks imbued with traditional Russian imagery and themes.

Working together in a cooperative spirit, the artists Vasily Polenov and Viktor Vasnetsov designed a plain but picturesque church, with murals painted by Polenov, Vasnetsov and his brother, a gilded iconostasis by Ilya Repin and Mikhail Nesterov, and folklore-inspired sculptures by Viktor Hartmann and Mark Antokolsky. Towards the turn of the 20th century, drama and opera on Russian folklore themes (e.g., Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;) were produced in Abramtsevo by the likes of Konstantin Stanislavsky, with sets contributed by Vasnetsov, Mikhail Vrubel, and other distinguished artists.

On August 12, 1977, by the decree of the Council of Ministers of Soviet Russia, the Abramtsevo Museum-Estate was transformed into the State Historical, Artistic and Literary Museum-Reserve Abramtsevo. In 1995, it was classified as cultural heritage monument of federal significance.

==Museum==
Abramtsevo is now open to the public and tourists can wander along the many paths through the surrounding forest and cross the wooden bridges that served as an inspiration for the artists at the Abramtsevo Colony. They can also visit many of the buildings to see works produced by the artists at the colony, e.g., a wooden bathhouse in the shape of a traditional dwelling of Ancient Rus, designed by Ivan Ropet, and the House on Chicken Legs, a fairy-tale abode of an evil witch, Baba Yaga, designed by Vasnetsov. One building, the main &quot;manor,&quot; is said to have been the model for the estate in which Anton Chekhov set &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;.

<text>A typology is a system of classification used to organize things according to similar or dissimilar characteristics. 

Typologies are distinct from taxonomies in that they primarily address things not categorizable based on empirical and objective characteristics, such as abstract and conceptual ideas or subjective criteria, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

The earliest evidence for the use of typology as a noun in the English language dates to the 1850s when it was invoked by William Maxwell Hetherington.

<text>Toccata (from Italian &quot;toccare&quot;, literally, &quot;to touch&quot;, with &quot;toccata&quot; being the action of touching) is a virtuoso piece of music typically for a keyboard or plucked string instrument featuring fast-moving, lightly fingered or otherwise virtuosic passages or sections, with or without imitative or fugal interludes, generally emphasizing the dexterity of the performer&#x27;s fingers. Less frequently, the name is applied to works for multiple instruments (the opening of Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; being a notable example).

==History==
===Renaissance===
The form first appeared in the late Renaissance period. It originated in northern Italy. Several publications of the 1590s include toccatas, by composers such as Claudio Merulo, Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, Adriano Banchieri, and Luzzasco Luzzaschi. These are keyboard compositions in which one hand, and then the other, performs virtuosic runs and brilliant cascading passages against a chordal accompaniment in the other hand. Among the composers working in Venice at this time was the young Hans Leo Hassler, who studied with the Gabrielis; he brought the form back with him to Germany. It was in Germany where it underwent its highest development, culminating in the work of Johann Sebastian Bach more than a hundred years later.

===Baroque===

The Baroque toccata, beginning with Girolamo Frescobaldi, is more sectional and increased in length, intensity and virtuosity from the Renaissance version, reaching heights of extravagance equivalent to the overwhelming detail seen in the architecture of the period. It often featured rapid runs and arpeggios alternating with chordal or fugal parts. Sometimes there was a lack of regular tempo and almost always an improvisational feel.

Other Baroque composers of toccatas, in the period before Bach, include Johann Pachelbel, Michelangelo Rossi, Johann Jakob Froberger, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Alessandro Scarlatti, and Dieterich Buxtehude.

Bach&#x27;s toccatas are among the most famous examples of the form, and his Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 is one of the most popular organ works today, although its authorship is disputed by some authorities. His toccatas for organ are improvisatory compositions, and are often followed by an independent fugue movement. In such cases, the toccata is used in place of the usually more stable prelude. Bach&#x27;s toccatas for harpsichord BWV 910-916 are multi-sectional works which include fugal writing, rhetorical flourishes, recitative, and aria-like movements as part of their structure.

===After the Baroque===
Beyond the Baroque period, toccatas are found less frequently. There are a few notable examples, however. From the Romantic period, Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt each wrote a piano toccata. Schumann&#x27;s ambitious Toccata in C major is considered one of the most technically difficult works in the repertoire and the foremost representative of the genre in the 1800s. The Liszt toccata is a very short and austere composition from his late period, and is practically a toccata only by name. Smaller-scale toccatas are sometimes called &quot;toccatina&quot;: Liszt&#x27;s contemporary and well-known virtuoso in his day Charles-Valentin Alkan composed a brief toccatina as his last published work (Op. 75).

From the early 20th century, Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian each wrote a toccata for solo piano, as did French composers Maurice Ravel as part of &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot;, Jules Massenet, Claude Debussy in his suite &quot;Pour le piano&quot; and also &quot;Jardins sous la pluie&quot; (which is a toccata but not in name), Pierre Sancan and York Bowen&#x27;s Toccata Op. 155. Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote four toccatas for solo piano, while Moises Moleiro wrote two. George Enescu&#x27;s Piano Suite No. 2, Op. 10, opens with a toccata. The first piece&quot;, &quot;Sévère réprimande&quot;&quot; (&quot;Severe Reprimand&quot;), of Erik Satie&#x27;s 1912 composition &quot;Veritables Preludes flasques&quot; (pour un chien) is a toccata. The British composer Peter Seabourne reverted to the earlier multi-sectional manner of Bach in his piano cycle called &quot;Steps Volume 6: Toccatas and Fantasias&quot;, his six examples being designed to be interpolated between the seven Bach toccatas for harpsichord BWV 910-916. The same composer&#x27;s earlier cycle &quot;Steps Volume 1: An anthology&quot; includes a toccata movement called &quot;A Touch&quot;, with reference to the Italian verb &quot;toccare&quot;.

The toccata form was of great importance in the French romantic organ school, something of which Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens laid the foundation with his &quot;Fanfare&quot;. Toccatas in this style usually consist of rapid chord progressions combined with a powerful tune (often played in the pedal). The most famous examples are the ending movement of Charles-Marie Widor&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot;, and the Finale of Louis Vierne&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;.

Toccatas occasionally make appearances in works for full orchestra; a notable example is the final movement of the Eighth Symphony of Ralph Vaughan Williams. It could be said that the finales of Francis Poulenc&#x27;s Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra and Maurice Ravel&#x27;s Piano Concerto are toccatas in all but name. The first movements of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s Piano Concerto and Nikolai Medtner&#x27;s 2nd piano concerto are toccatas. The final movement of John Adams&#x27; Violin Concerto is entitled &quot;Toccare,&quot; again referring to the origins of the word toccata; and the first movement (&quot;Schnelle halbe&quot;) of Paul Hindemith&#x27;s fifth &quot;Kammermusik&quot; (a viola concerto) is written as a toccata. Another contemporary composer who has written many toccatas is Emma Lou Diemer. In addition to several toccatas for organ, she has written three for piano (that of 1979 is frequently played), one for flute chorus, one for violin and piano, one for solo timpani and one for six mallet percussion. Both the finales of Samuel Barber&#x27;s violin concerto and piano concerto can be described as toccatas. The Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera often utilizes toccatas or toccata-like forms as the finales of his works; notably in the Harp Concerto, Piano Concerto No.1, Violin Concerto, Guitar Sonata, and his Piano Sonatas. Russian jazz composer Nikolai Kapustin composed two toccatinas: one as part of his Eight Concert Etudes, Op. 40 and another, Opus 36. Evgeny Kissin wrote a jazz-inspired toccata as part of his &quot;Four Piano Pieces&quot;, Op. 1.

==Literature==
Robert Browning used the motif or concept of a toccata by Baldassare Galuppi to evoke thoughts of human transience in his poem &quot;A Toccata of Galuppi&#x27;s&quot; (although Galuppi did not actually write any piece with the name &#x27;Toccata&#x27;).

<text>Cumbric is an extinct Celtic language of the Brittonic subgroup spoken during the Early Middle Ages in the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; or &quot;Old North&quot;, in Northern England and the southern Scottish Lowlands. It was closely related to Old Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. Place-name evidence suggests Cumbric may also have been spoken as far south as Pendle and the Yorkshire Dales. The prevailing view is that it became extinct in the 12th century, after the incorporation of the semi-independent Kingdom of Strathclyde into the Kingdom of Scotland.

==Problems with terminology==

Dauvit Broun sets out the problems with the various terms used to describe the Cumbric language and its speakers. The people seem to have called themselves the same way that the Welsh called themselves (most likely from reconstructed Brittonic meaning &quot;fellow countrymen&quot;). The Welsh and the Cumbric-speaking people of what are now southern Scotland and northern England probably felt they were actually one ethnic group. Old Irish speakers called them &quot;Britons&quot;, , or . The Norse called them . In Latin, the terms and were Latinised as Cambria and Cumbria respectively. In Medieval Latin, the English term Welsh became (&quot;of Wales&quot;), while the term referred to Cumbrians (&quot;of Cumbria&quot;). However, in Scots, a Cumbric speaker seems to have been called – from the Scots &quot;Welsh&quot;.


The Latinate term Cambria is often used for Wales; nevertheless, the &quot;Life of St Kentigern&quot; ( 1200) by Jocelyn of Furness has the following passage:

John T. Koch defined the specifically Cumbric region as &quot;the area approximately between the line of the River Mersey and the Forth-Clyde Isthmus&quot;, but went on to include evidence from the Wirral Peninsula in his discussion and did not define its easterly extent. Kenneth H. Jackson described Cumbric as &quot;the Brittonic dialect of Cumberland, Westmorland, northern Lancashire, and south-west Scotland&quot; and went on to define the region further as being bound in the north by the Firth of Clyde, in the south by the River Ribble and in the east by the Southern Scottish Uplands and the Pennine Ridge. The study Brittonic Language in the Old North by Alan G. James, concerned with documenting place- and river-names as evidence for Cumbric and the pre-Cumbric Brittonic dialects of the region &quot;Yr Hen Ogledd&quot;, considered Loch Lomond the northernmost limit of the study with the southernmost limits being Liverpool Bay and the Humber, although a few more southerly place-names in Cheshire and, to a lesser extent, Derbyshire and Staffordshire were also included.

==Available evidence==

The evidence from Cumbric comes almost entirely through secondary sources, since no known contemporary written records of the language survive. The majority of evidence comes from place names of the north of England and the south of Scotland. Other sources include the personal names of Strathclyde Britons in Scottish, Irish, and Anglo-Saxon sources, and a few Cumbric words surviving into the High Middle Ages in southwest Scotland as legal terms. Although the language is long extinct, traces of its vocabulary arguably have persisted into the modern era in the form of &quot;counting scores&quot; and in a handful of dialectal words.

From this scanty evidence, little can be deduced about the singular characteristics of Cumbric, not even the name by which its speakers referred to it. However, linguists generally agree that Cumbric was a Western Brittonic language closely related to Welsh and, more distantly, to Cornish and Breton.

Around the time of the battle described in the poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, c. 600, Common Brittonic is believed to have been transitioning into its daughter languages: Cumbric in North Britain, Old Welsh in Wales, and Southwestern Brittonic, the ancestor of Cornish and Breton. Kenneth Jackson concludes that the majority of changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the fifth to the end of the sixth century. This involved syncope and the loss of final syllables. If the poem ultimately dates to this time, it would have originally been written in an early form of Cumbric, the usual name for the Brythonic speech of the Hen Ogledd; Jackson suggested the name &quot;Primitive Cumbric&quot; for the dialect spoken at the time. However, scholars date the poem to between the 7th and the early 11th centuries, and the earliest surviving manuscript of it dates to the 13th, written in Old Welsh and Middle Welsh.

===Place names===
Cumbric place-names occur in Scotland south of the firths of Forth and Clyde. Brittonic names north of this line are Pictish. Cumbric names are also found commonly in the historic county of Cumberland and in bordering areas of Northumberland. They are less common in Westmorland, east Northumberland, and Durham, with some in Lancashire and the adjoining areas of North and West Yorkshire. Approaching Cheshire, late Brittonic placenames are probably better characterised as Welsh rather than as Cumbric. As noted below, however, any clear distinction between Cumbric and Welsh is difficult to prove. Many Brittonic place-names remain in these regions which should not be described as Cumbric, such as Leeds, Manchester, Wigan and York, because they were coined in a period before Brittonic split into Cumbric and its sister dialects.

Some of the principal towns and cities of the region have names of Cumbric origin, including:
*Bathgate, West Lothian: meaning &#x27;boar wood&#x27; (Welsh &#x27;wild boar&#x27; + &#x27;forest, wood&#x27;).
*Bryn, Metropolitan Borough of Wigan: from the word meaning &quot;hill&quot; (W. &quot;bryn&quot;).
*Carlisle, Cumberland: recorded as in the Roman period; the word &#x27;fort&#x27; was added later. The Welsh form is derived by regular sound changes from the Romano-British name.
*Glasgow, Scotland: widely believed to derive from words cognate with glas &#x27;green&#x27; and the Welsh gae, &#x27;field&#x27; (possibly that below Glasgow Cathedral).
*Lanark, Lanarkshire: from the equivalent of Welsh &#x27;glade, clearing&#x27;.
*Penicuik, Midlothian: from words meaning &#x27;hill of the cuckoo&#x27; (W. ).
*Penrith, Westmorland &amp; Furness: meaning &#x27;chief ford&#x27; (Welsh &#x27;head, chief&#x27; + &#x27;ford&#x27;).

Several supposed Cumbric elements occur repeatedly in place names of the region. The following table lists some of them according to the modern Welsh equivalent:

Some Cumbric names have historically been replaced by Scottish Gaelic, Middle English, or Scots equivalents, and in some cases the different forms occur in the historical record.
*Edinburgh occurs in early Welsh texts as and in medieval Scottish records as (Gaelic ), all meaning &#x27;fort of Eidyn&#x27;.
*Falkirk similarly has several alternative medieval forms meaning &#x27;speckled church&#x27;: etc. from Cumbric (Welsh ); etc. from Gaelic (modern Gaelic ); etc. from Scots (in turn from Old English ).
*Kirkintilloch began as a Cumbric name recorded as in the 10th century, but was partly replaced by the Gaelic words &#x27;head&#x27; + &#x27;hillock&#x27; later on (plus &#x27;church&#x27; from Scots again).
*Kinneil derives from Gaelic &#x27;head of the [Antonine] Wall&#x27; but it was recorded by Nennius as (Welsh ), and by Bede as , which appears to be a merger of Cumbric and Gaelic.

Derivatives of Common Brittonic &quot;*magno&quot;, such as Welsh &quot;maen&quot; and Cornish &quot;men&quot;, mean &quot;stone&quot;, particularly one with a special purpose or significance. In the Cumbric region, the word &quot;Man&quot; frequently occurs in geographical names associated with standing stones (most notably the Old Man of Coniston) and it is possible, albeit &quot;hard to say&quot; according to Alan G. James, if the Cumbric reflex &quot;*main&quot; had any influence on these.

===Counting systems===

Among the evidence that Cumbric might have influenced local English dialects are a group of counting systems, or scores, recorded in various parts of northern England. Around 100 of these systems have been collected since the 18th century; the scholarly consensus is that these derive from a Brittonic language closely related to Welsh. Though they are often referred to as &quot;sheep-counting numerals&quot;, most recorded scores were not used to count sheep, but in knitting or for children&#x27;s games or nursery rhymes. These scores are often suggested to represent a survival from medieval Cumbric, a theory first popularized in the 19th century. However, later scholars came to reject this idea, suggesting instead that the scores were later imports from either Wales or Scotland, but in light of the dearth of evidence one way or another, Markku Filppula, Juhani Klemola, and Heli Paulasto posit that it remains plausible that the counting systems are indeed of Cumbric origin.

Cumbric, in common with other Brythonic languages, used a vigesimal counting system, i.e. numbering up to twenty, with intermediate numbers for ten and fifteen. Therefore, after numbering one to ten, numbers follow the format one-and-ten, two-and-ten etc. to fifteen, then one-and-fifteen, two-and-fifteen to twenty. The dialect words for the numbers themselves show much variation across the region. (see chart) 

===Scots and English===
A number of words occurring in the Scots language and Northern English dialects have been proposed as being of possible Brittonic origin. Ascertaining the real derivation of these words is far from simple, due in part to the similarities between some cognates in the Brittonic and Goidelic languages and the fact that borrowing took place in both directions between these languages.

Another difficulty lies with other words which were taken into Old English, as in many cases it is impossible to tell whether the borrowing is directly from Brittonic or not (e.g. &quot;Brogat&quot;, &quot;Crag&quot;, below). The following are possibilities:
* Bach – &#x27;cowpat&#x27; (cf. Welsh &#x27;dung&#x27;, Gaelic )
* Baivenjar – &#x27;mean fellow&#x27; (Welsh &#x27;scoundrel&#x27;)
* Brat – &#x27;apron&#x27;. The word appears in Welsh (with meanings &#x27;rag, cloth&#x27; and &#x27;pinafore&#x27;), Scots and northern English dialects, but may be an Old English borrowing from Old Irish.
* Brogat – a type of mead (Welsh &#x27;&#x27; – also found in Chaucer)
* Coble – a type of small, flat-bottomed boat (also in Northeast England), akin to Welsh &quot;&quot; &#x27;a hollow&#x27; and Latin &quot;&quot;; distinct from the round-bottomed coracle.
* Crag – &#x27;rocks&#x27;. Either from Brittonic (Welsh ) or Goidelic (Scottish Gaelic ).
* Croot – &#x27;small boy&#x27; (Welsh , Gaelic &#x27;small person&#x27;, &#x27;humpback/hunchback&#x27;)
* Croude – a type of small harp or lyre (as opposed to the larger ; Welsh &#x27;bowed lyre&#x27;, later &#x27;fiddle&#x27;, Gaelic )
* Lum – Scottish word for &#x27;chimney&#x27; (Middle Welsh )

==Equivalence with Old Welsh==

The linguistic term Cumbric is defined according to geographical rather than linguistic criteria: that is, it refers to the variety of Brittonic spoken within a particular region of North Britain and implies nothing about that variety except that it was geographically distinct from other varieties. This has led to a discussion about the nature of Cumbric and its relationship with other Brittonic languages, in particular with Old Welsh.

Linguists appear undecided as to whether Cumbric should be considered a separate language, or a dialect of Old Welsh. Koch calls it a dialect but goes on to say that some of the place names in the Cumbric region &quot;clearly reflect a developed medieval language, much like Welsh, Cornish or Breton&quot;. Jackson also calls it a dialect but points out that &quot;to call it Pr[imitive] W[elsh] would be inaccurate&quot;, so clearly views it as distinct in some meaningful respect.

It has been suggested that Cumbric was more closely aligned to the Pictish language than to Welsh, though there is considerable debate regarding the classification of that language. On the basis of place name evidence it has also been proposed that all three languages were very similar. In all probability, the &quot;Cumbric&quot; of Lothian more nearly resembled the &quot;Pictish&quot; of adjacent Fife than the Welsh dialects spoken over 300 miles away in Dyfed and accordingly, Alan G. James has argued that all 3 languages may have formed a continuum.

The whole question is made more complex because there is no consensus as to whether any principled distinction can be made between languages and dialects.

Below, some of the proposed differences between Cumbric and Old Welsh are discussed.

===Retention of Brittonic &quot;*rk&quot;===
In Welsh, Cornish, and Breton, the Common Brittonic cluster &quot;*rk&quot; was spirantized to (Welsh &quot;rch&quot;, Cornish &quot;rgh&quot;, Breton &quot;rc&#x27;h&quot;) but a number of place names appear to show Cumbric retained the stop in this position. Lanark and Lanercost are thought to contain the equivalent of Welsh &quot;llannerch&quot; &#x27;clearing&#x27;.

There is evidence to the contrary, however, including the place names Powmaughan and Maughanby (containing Welsh &quot;Meirchion&quot;) and the word &quot;kelchyn&quot; (related to Welsh &quot;cylch&quot;). Jackson concludes that the change of Common Brittonic &quot;*rk&quot; &gt; &quot;&quot;may&quot; have been somewhat later in Cumbric&quot;.

===Retention of Brittonic &quot;*mb&quot;===
There is evidence to suggest that the consonant cluster &quot;mb&quot; remained distinct in Cumbric later than the time it was assimilated to &quot;mm&quot; in Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. The cluster remains in:
* Old English &quot;Cumbraland&quot; &quot;land of Cumbrians&quot; (from Common Brittonic &quot;*kombrogi&quot;, whence Welsh &quot;Cymru&quot; &quot;Wales&quot; also originates).
* &quot;Crombocwater&quot; and &quot;Crombokwatre&quot;, two 14th-century records of Crummock Water and &quot;Crombok&quot; an 1189 record for Crummack Dale in Yorkshire (from Common Brittonic &quot;*Crumbāco-&quot; &quot;curved one&quot; (W &quot;crwm&quot; &quot;curved&quot;)).
* Cam Beck, the name of a stream in north Cumbria recorded as &quot;Camboc&quot; (1169) and believed to be from Common Brittonic &quot;*Cambāco-&quot; &quot;crooked stream&quot; (W &quot;cam&quot;, CB &quot;kamm&quot;).
* Crimple Beck, Yorkshire, which is said to derive from Common Brittonic. &quot;*Crumbopull-&quot; &quot;crooked pool&quot;. Here the &quot;b&quot; is assumed to have survived late enough to cause provection.

Jackson notes that only in the north does the cluster appear in place names borrowed after &quot;circa&quot; 600AD and concludes that it may have been a later dialectal survival here.

===Syncope===
Jackson notes the legal term &quot;galnys&quot;, equivalent to Welsh &quot;galanas&quot;, may show syncope of internal syllables to be a feature of Cumbric. Further evidence is wanting, however.

===Devoicing===
James mentions that devoicing appears to be a feature of many Cumbric place names. Devoicing of word final consonants is a feature of modern Breton and, to an extent, Cornish. Watson notes initial devoicing in Tinnis Castle (in Drumelzier) (compare Welsh &quot;dinas&quot; &#x27;fortress, city&#x27;) as an example of this, which can also be seen in the Cornish Tintagel, &quot;din&quot; &#x27;fort&#x27;. Also notable are the different English names of two Welsh towns named &quot;Dinbych&quot; (&#x27;little fort&#x27;); Denbigh and Tenby.

There is also a significant number of place names which do not support this theory. Devoke Water and Cumdivock (&lt; &quot;Dyfoc&quot;, according to Ekwall) and Derwent (&lt; Common Brittonic &quot;Derwentiō&quot;) all have initial . The name Calder (&lt; Brit. &quot;*Caletodubro-&quot;) in fact appears to show a voiced Cumbric consonant where Welsh has &quot;Calettwr&quot; by provection, which Jackson believes reflects an earlier stage of pronunciation. Jackson also notes that Old English had no internal or final , so would be borrowed with by sound substitution. This can be seen in names with &quot;c, k, ck&quot; (e.g. Cocker &lt; Brittonic &quot;*&quot;, Eccles &lt; Brittonic &quot;eglēsia&quot;).

===Loss of ===
The Cumbric personal names Gospatrick, Gososwald and Gosmungo meaning &#x27;servant of St...&#x27; (Welsh, Cornish, Breton &quot;gwas&quot; &#x27;servant, boy&#x27;) and the Galloway dialect word &quot;gossock&quot; &#x27;short, dark haired inhabitant of Wigtownshire&#x27; (W. &quot;gwasog&quot; &#x27;a servant&#x27;) apparently show that the Cumbric equivalent of Welsh and Cornish &quot;gwas&quot; &amp; B &quot;gwaz&quot; &#x27;servant&#x27; was &quot;*gos&quot;. Jackson suggests that it may be a survival of the original Proto-Celtic form of the word in –o- (i.e. &quot;*uɸo-sto&quot;).

This idea is disputed by the &quot;Dictionary of the Scots Language&quot;; and the occurrence in Gospatrick&#x27;s Writ of the word &quot;wassenas&quot; &#x27;dependants&#x27;, thought to be from the same word &quot;gwas&quot;, is evidence against Jackson&#x27;s theory. Koch notes that the alternation between &quot;gwa-&quot; and &quot;go-&quot; is common among the Brittonic languages and does not amount to a systematic sound change in any of them.

Thomas Clancy opined that the royal feminine personal name in Life of Kentigern, &quot;Languoreth&quot;, demonstrates the presence of /gw/ Cumbric.

It is noteworthy that the toponym &quot;Brenkibeth&quot; in Cumberland (now Burntippet; possibly &quot;bryn&quot;, &quot;hill&quot; + &quot;gwyped&quot;, &quot;gnats&quot;) may display this syllable anglicized as &quot;-k-&quot;. The name, however, may not be Brittonic at all, and instead be of Scandinavian origin.

===Semantics of &quot;Penn&quot;===
In the &quot;Book of Aneirin&quot;, a poem entitled &quot; &quot;Peis Dinogat&quot; &quot; (possibly set in the Lake District of Cumbria), contains a usage of the word &quot;penn&quot; &quot;head&quot; (attached to the names of several animals hunted by the protagonist), that is unique in medieval Welsh literature and may, according to Koch, reflect Cumbric influence (&quot;[r]eferring to a single animal in this way is otherwise found only in Breton, and we have no evidence that the construction ever had any currency in the present-day Wales&quot;). The relevant lines are:

:Pan elei dy dat ty e vynyd
:Dydygei ef penn ywrch penn gwythwch penn hyd
:Penn grugyar vreith o venyd
:Penn pysc o rayadyr derwennyd

Translated as:

: When your father went to [the] mountain
: He brought a head of buck, head of wild pig, head of stag
: Head of speckled grouse from [the] mountain
: Head of fish from [the] falls of Derwent

The form &quot;derwennydd&quot; however, is at odds with the absence of the ending &quot;-ydd&quot; noted below.

It is to be noted, however, that such semantics are probably archaisms, and rather than being features diagnostic of linguistic distinctiveness, are more likely to be legacies of features once common to all Brittonic speech.

===Definite article===
The modern Brittonic languages have different forms of the definite article: Welsh &quot;yr, -&#x27;r, y&quot;, Cornish &quot;an&quot;, and Breton &quot;an, ar, al&quot;. These are all taken to derive from an unstressed form of the Common Brittonic demonstrative &quot;*sindos&quot;, altered by assimilation (compare the Gaelic articles). Throughout Old Welsh the article is &quot;ir&quot; (or &quot;-r&quot; after a vowel), but there is evidence in Cumbric for an article in &quot;-n&quot; alongside one in &quot;-r&quot;. Note the following:

*Tallentire, Cumbria (&quot;Talentir&quot; 1200–25): &#x27;brow/end of the land&#x27; (Welsh &quot;tal y tir&quot;)
*Triermain, Cumbria (&quot;Trewermain, Treverman&quot; c 1200): &#x27;homestead at the stone&#x27; (Welsh &quot;tre(f) y maen&quot;)
*Treales, Lancashire (&quot;Treueles&quot; 1086): possibly &#x27;village of the court&#x27; (Welsh &quot;tre(f) y llys&quot;). But note Treflys, Powys which has no article.
*Pen-y-Ghent, Yorkshire (&quot;Penegent&quot; 1307): &#x27;hill of the border country&#x27; (Welsh &quot;pen y gaint&quot;). The final element is disputed. Ekwall says it is identical to Kent (&lt; Br &quot;*Kantion&quot;), which is related to Welsh &quot;cant&quot; &#x27;rim, border&#x27;, though Mills gives &#x27;coastal district&#x27; or &#x27;land of the hosts or armies&#x27; for the county.
*Traquair, Borders (&quot;Treverquyrd&quot; 1124): &#x27;homestead on the River Quair&#x27; (Welsh &quot;tre(f) y Quair&quot;).
*Penicuik, Midlothian (&quot;Penicok&quot; 1250): &#x27;hill of the cuckoo&#x27; (Welsh &quot;pen y cog&quot;)
*Liscard, Wirral Peninsula (&quot;Lisenecark&quot; 1260): possibly &#x27;court of the rock&#x27; (Welsh &quot;llys y garreg&quot;), but also suggested is Irish &quot;lios na carraige&quot; of identical meaning.

===Absence of &quot;-ydd&quot;===
Of all the names of possible Cumbric derivation, few are more certain than Carlisle and Derwent which can be directly traced back to their Romano-British recorded forms &quot;Luguvalium&quot; and &quot;Derventio&quot;.

The modern and medieval forms of Carlisle (&quot;Luel&quot; c1050, &quot;Cardeol&quot; 1092, &quot;Karlioli&quot; c1100 (in the Medieval Latin genitive case), &quot;Cærleoil&quot; 1130) and Derwent (&quot;Deorwentan stream&quot; c890 (Old English), &quot;Derewent&quot;) suggest derivations from Br *&quot;Luguvaljon&quot; and &quot;*Derwentjō&quot;. But the Welsh forms &quot;Caerliwelydd&quot; and &quot;Derwennydd&quot; are derived from alternative forms &quot;*Luguvalijon, *Derwentijō&quot; which gave the &quot;-ydd&quot; ending. This appears to show a divergence between Cumbric and Welsh at a relatively early date.

If this was an early dialectal variation, it can&#x27;t be applied as a universal sound law, as the equivalent of W &quot;mynydd&quot; &#x27;mountain&#x27; occurs in a number of Cumbric names with the spirant intact: E.g. Mindrum (&quot;Minethrum&quot; 1050) from &#x27;mountain ridge&#x27; (Welsh &quot;mynydd trum&quot;). It might also be noted that Medieval Welsh forms of &quot;Caerliwelydd&quot;
and &quot;Derwennydd&quot; both occur in poems of supposed Cumbrian origin whose rhyme and metre would be disrupted if the ending were absent.

Of additional relevance is that Guto Rhys demonstrated &quot;some robust proof&quot; of the presence of the &quot;-ydd&quot; ending in the closely aligned Pictish language.

===Use of the name element &quot;Gos-&quot;===
One particularly distinctive element of Cumbric is the repeated use of the element or (W. &#x27;boy, lad; servant, attendant&#x27;) in personal names, followed by the name of a saint. The practice is reminiscent of Gaelic names such as &quot;Maol Choluim&quot; &quot;Malcolm&quot; and &quot;Gille Crìosd&quot; &quot;Gilchrist&quot;, which have Scottish Gaelic (Old Irish &#x27;bald, tonsured; servant&#x27;) and (&#x27;servant, lad&#x27;, &lt; Old Irish &#x27;a youth&#x27;).

The most well-known example of this Cumbric naming practice is &quot;Gospatric&quot;, which occurs as the name of several notable Anglo-Scottish noblemen in the 11th and 12th centuries. Other examples, standardised from original sources, include &quot;Gosmungo&quot; (Saint Mungo), &quot;Gososwald&quot; (Oswald of Northumbria) and &quot;Goscuthbert&quot; (Cuthbert).

==Date of extinction==
It is impossible to give an exact date of the extinction of Cumbric. However, there are some pointers which may give a reasonably accurate estimate. In the mid-11th century, some landowners still bore what appear to be Cumbric names. Examples of such landowners are Dunegal (Dyfnwal), lord of Strathnith or Nithsdale; Moryn (Morien), lord of Cardew and Cumdivock near Carlisle; and Eilifr (Eliffer), lord of Penrith.

There is a village near Carlisle called Cumwhitton (earlier Cumquinton). This appears to contain the Norman name Quinton, affixed to a cognate of the Welsh &quot;cwm&quot;, meaning valley. There were no Normans in this area until 1069 at the earliest.

In the Battle of the Standard in 1138, the Cumbrians are noted as a separate ethnic group. Given that their material culture was very similar to their Gaelic and Anglian neighbours, it is arguable that what set them apart was still their language. Also the castle at Castle Carrock – Castell Caerog – dates from around 1160–1170. Barmulloch, earlier Badermonoc (Cumbric &quot;monk&#x27;s dwelling&quot;), was given to the church by Malcolm IV of Scotland between 1153 and 1165.

A more controversial point is the surname Wallace. It means &quot;Welshman&quot;. It is possible that all the Wallaces in the Clyde area were medieval immigrants from Wales, but given that the term was also used for local Cumbric-speaking Strathclyde Welsh, it seems equally, if not more, likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being &quot;Welsh&quot; due to their Cumbric language.

Surnames in Scotland were not inherited before 1200 and not regularly until 1400. Sir William Wallace (known in Gaelic as Uilleam Breatnach – namely William the Briton or Welshman) came from the Renfrew area – itself a Cumbric name. Wallace slew the sheriff of Lanark (also a Cumbric name) in 1297. Even if he had inherited the surname from his father, it is possible that the family spoke Cumbric within memory in order to be thus named.

There are also some historical pointers to a continuing separate ethnic identity. Prior to being crowned king of Scotland in 1124, David I was invested with the title Prince of the Cumbrians. William the Lion between 1173 and 1180 made an address to his subjects, identifying the Cumbrians as a separate group. This does not prove that any of them still spoke Cumbric at this time.

The legal documents in the Lanercost Cartulary, dating from the late 12th century, show witnesses with Norman French or English names, and no obvious Cumbric names. Though these people represent the upper classes, it seems significant that by the late 12th century in the Lanercost area, Cumbric is not obvious in these personal names. In 1262 in Peebles, jurymen in a legal dispute over peat cutting also have names which mostly appear Norman French or English, but possible exceptions are Gauri Pluchan, Cokin Smith and Robert Gladhoc, where &quot;Gladhoc&quot; has the look of an adjectival noun similar to Welsh &quot;gwladog&quot; = &quot;countryman&quot;. In the charters of Wetherall Priory near Carlisle there is a monk called Robert Minnoc who appears as a witness to 8 charters dating from around 1260. His name is variously spelled Minnoc/Minot/Mynoc and it is tempting to see an equivalent of the Welsh &quot;mynach&quot; – &quot;Robert the Monk&quot; here.

Given that in other areas which have given up speaking Celtic languages, the upper classes have generally become Anglicised before the peasantry, it is not implausible that the peasantry continued to speak Cumbric for at least a little while after. Around 1200 there is a list of the names of men living in the area of Peebles. Amongst them are Cumbric names such as Gospatrick: servant or follower of Saint Patrick, Gosmungo: servant of Saint Mungo, Guososwald: servant of Oswald of Northumbria and Goscubrycht: servant of Cuthbert. Two of the saints – Oswald and Cuthbert — are from Northumbria showing influence on Cumbric not found in Welsh.

In 1305 Edward I of England prohibited the &quot;Leges inter Brettos et Scottos&quot;. The term Brets or Britons refers to the native, traditionally Cumbric speaking people of southern Scotland and northern England as well as the Pictish speakers in Northern Scotland.

It seems that Cumbric could well have survived into the middle of the 12th century as a community language and even lasted into the 13th on the tongues of the last remaining speakers. Certain areas seem to be particularly dense in Cumbric place-names even down to very minor features. The two most striking of these are around Lanercost east of Carlisle and around Torquhan south of Edinburgh. If the 1262 names from Peebles do contain traces of Cumbric personal names then we can imagine Cumbric dying out between 1250 and 1300 at the very latest.

<doc id="312714" wikidata="Q27124" url="?curid=312714" title="Red knot">
<text>The red knot or just knot (Calidris canutus) is a medium-sized shorebird which breeds in tundra and the Arctic Cordillera in the far north of Canada, Europe, and Russia. It is a large member of the &quot;Calidris&quot; sandpipers, second only to the great knot. Six subspecies are recognised.

Their diet varies according to season; arthropods and larvae are the preferred food items at the breeding grounds, while various hard-shelled molluscs are consumed at other feeding sites at other times. North American breeders migrate to coastal areas in Europe and South America, while the Eurasian populations winter in Africa, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand. This species forms enormous flocks when not breeding.

== Taxonomy, systematics, and evolution ==
The red knot was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Tringa canutus&quot;. One theory is that it gets its name and species epithet from King Cnut; the name would refer to the knot&#x27;s foraging along the tide line and the story of Cnut and the tide. There appears to be no historical foundation for this etymology. Another etymology is that the name is onomatopoeic, based on the bird&#x27;s grunting call note.

The red knot and the great knot were originally the only two species placed in the genus &quot;Calidris&quot;, but many other species of sandpiper were subsequently added. A 2004 study found that the genus was polyphyletic and that the closest relative of the two knot species is the surfbird (currently &quot;Aphriza virgata&quot;).

There are six subspecies, in order of size;
* &quot;C. c. roselaari&quot; – (largest)
* &quot;C. c. rufa&quot; 
* &quot;C. c. canutus&quot; 
* &quot;C. c. islandica&quot; 
* &quot;C. c. rogersi&quot; 
* &quot;C. c. piersmai&quot; – (smallest)

Studies based on mitochondrial sequence divergence and models of paleoclimatic changes during the glacial cycles suggest that &quot;canutus&quot; is the most basal population, separating about 20,000 years ago (95% confidence interval: 60,000–4,000 years ago) with two distinct lineages of the American and Siberian breeders emerging about 12,000 years ago (with a 95% confidence interval: 45,000–3,500 years ago).

== Distribution and migration ==

In the breeding season, the red knot has a distribution in the high Arctic, then migrates to coasts around the world from 50° N to 58° S. The red knot has one of the longest migrations of any bird. Every year it travels more than from the Arctic to the southern tip of South America and repeats the trip in reverse. The exact migration routes and wintering grounds of individual subspecies are still somewhat uncertain. The nominate race &quot;C. c. canutus&quot; breeds in the Taymyr Peninsula and possibly Yakutia and migrates to Western Europe and then down to western and southern Africa. &quot;C. c. rogersi&quot; breeds in the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia, and winters in eastern Australia and New Zealand. Small and declining numbers of &quot;rogersi&quot; (but possibly of the later described &quot;piersmai&quot;) winter in the mudflats in the Gulf of Mannar and on the eastern coast of India. The recently split race &quot;C. c. piersmai&quot; breeds in the New Siberian Islands and winters in north-western Australia. &quot;C. c. roselaari&quot; breeds in Wrangel Island in Siberia and north-western Alaska, and it apparently winters in Florida, Panama and Venezuela. &quot;C. c. rufa&quot; breeds in the Canadian low Arctic, and winters South America, and &quot;C. c. islandica&quot; breeds in the Canadian high Arctic as well as Greenland, and winters in Western Europe.

Birds wintering in west Africa were found to restrict their daily foraging to a range of just of intertidal area and roosted a single site for several months. In temperate regions such as the Wadden Sea they have been found to change roost sites each week and their feeding range may be as much as during the course of a week.

B95, also known as Moonbird, is a noted individual of the subspecies &quot;C. c. rufa&quot;. A male, he has become famous amongst conservationists for his extreme longevity — he was aged at least 20 as of his last sighting in May 2014.

== Description and anatomy ==

An adult red knot is the second largest &quot;Calidris&quot; sandpiper, measuring long with a wingspan. The body shape is typical for the genus, with a small head and eyes, a short neck and a slightly tapering bill that is no longer than its head. It has short dark legs and a medium thin dark bill. The winter, or basic, plumage becomes uniformly pale grey, and is similar between the sexes. The alternate, or breeding, plumage is mottled grey on top with a cinnamon face, throat and breast and light-coloured rear belly. The alternate plumage of females is similar to that of the male except it is slightly lighter and the eye-line is less distinct. &quot;Canutus&quot;, &quot;islandica&quot; and &quot;piersmai&quot; are the &quot;darker&quot; subspecies. Subspecies &quot;rogersi&quot; has a lighter belly than either &quot;roselaari&quot; or &quot;piersmai&quot;, and &quot;rufa&quot; is the lightest in overall plumage. The transition from alternate to basic plumages begins at the breeding site but is most pronounced during the southwards migration. The molt to alternate plumage begins just prior to the northwards migration to the breeding grounds, but is mostly during the migration period.

The large size, white wing bar and grey rump and tail make it easy to identify in flight. When feeding the short dark green legs give it a characteristic &#x27;low-slung&#x27; appearance. When foraging singly, they rarely call, but when flying in a flock they make a low monosyllabic &#x27; and when migrating they utter a disyllabic &#x27;. They breed in the moist tundra during June to August. The display song of the male is a fluty &quot;poor-me&quot;. The display includes circling high with quivering wing beats and tumbling to the ground with the wings held upward. Both sexes incubate the eggs, but the female leaves parental care to the male once the eggs have hatched.

Juvenile birds have distinctive submarginal lines and brown coverts during the first year. In the breeding season the males can be separated with difficulty (&lt;80% accuracy in comparison to molecular methods) based on the more even shade of the red underparts that extend towards the rear of the belly.

The weight varies with subspecies, but ranges between . Red knots can double their weight prior to migration. Like many migratory birds they also reduce the size of their digestive organs prior to migration. The extent of the atrophy is not as pronounced as species like the bar-tailed godwit, probably because there are more opportunities to feed during migration for the red knot. Red knots are also able to change the size of their digestive organs seasonally. The size of the gizzard increases in thickness when feeding on harder foods on the wintering ground and decreases in size while feeding on softer foods in the breeding grounds. These changes can be very rapid, occurring in as little as six days.

== Behaviour ==

=== Diet and feeding ===
On the breeding grounds, knots eat mostly spiders, arthropods, larvae, and some plant material obtained by surface pecking, and on the wintering and migratory grounds they eat a variety of hard-shelled prey such as bivalves (including mussels), gastropods and small crabs that are ingested whole and crushed by a muscular stomach.

While feeding in mudflats during the winter and migration red knots are tactile feeders, probing for unseen prey in the mud. Their feeding techniques include the use of shallow probes into the mud while pacing along the shore. When the tide is ebbing, they tend to peck at the surface and in soft mud they may probe and plough forward with the bill inserted to about in depth. The bivalved mollusc &quot;Macoma&quot; is their preferred prey on European coasts, swallowing them whole and breaking them up in their gizzard. In Delaware Bay, they feed in large numbers on the eggs of horseshoe crabs, a rich, easily digestible food source, which spawn just as the birds arrive in spring. They are able to detect molluscs buried under wet sand from changes in the pressure of water that they sense using Herbst corpuscles in their bill. Unlike many tactile feeders their visual field is not panoramic (allowing for an almost 360 degree field of view), as during the short breeding season they switch to being visual hunters of mobile, unconcealed prey, which are obtained by pecking. Pecking is also used to obtain some surface foods in the wintering and migratory feeding grounds, such as the eggs of horseshoe crabs.

=== Breeding ===
The red knot is territorial and seasonally monogamous; it is unknown if pairs remain together from season to season. Males and females breeding in Russia have been shown to exhibit site fidelity towards their breeding locales from year to year, but there is no evidence as to whether they exhibit territorial fidelity. Males arrive before females after migration and begin defending territories. As soon as males arrive, they begin displaying, and aggressively defending their territory from other males.

The red knot nests on the ground, near water, and usually inland. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with leaves, lichens and moss. Males construct three to five nest scrapes in their territories prior to the arrival of the females. The female lays three or more usually four eggs, apparently laid over the course of six days. The eggs measure in size and are ground coloured, light olive to deep olive buff, with a slight gloss. Both parents incubate the eggs, sharing the duties equally. The off duty parent forages in flocks with others of the same species. The incubation period lasting around 22 days. At early stages of incubation the adults are easily flushed from the nest by the presence of humans near the nest, and may not return for several hours after being flushed. However, in later stages of incubation they will stay fast on the eggs. Hatching of the clutch is usually synchronised. The chicks are precocial at hatching, covered in downy cryptic feathers. The chicks and the parents move away from the nest within a day of hatching and begin foraging with their parents. The female leaves before the young fledge while the males stay on. After the young have fledged, the male begins his migration south and the young make their first migration on their own.

== Relationship with horseshoe crab ==

=== Stopover sites and food availability ===
As one of the “longest-distance migrants in the animal kingdom,” the red knot relies heavily on the same stopping sites each year along their migratory routes to refuel their bodies for completing their migrations to and from breeding sites. Red knots travel “in larger flocks than do most shorebirds&quot; flying “9300 miles from south to north every [northern hemisphere] spring and repeat the trip in reverse every autumn”. Northern hemisphere winters are spent in Tierra del Fuego South America and migration routes lead to breeding locations on islands and mainland above the Arctic circle during the short arctic summer. These long expeditions are broken into various segments about 1500 miles each ending at staging areas that are visited yearly. Specifically, the Delaware Bay is the most vital migratory rest stop for the red knot, as much of their physiological demands are met by consuming the abundance of horseshoe crab eggs as their main food source during migration. The relationship between red knot and horseshoe crab is evolutionarily intertwined as “their arrival coincides with the annual horseshoe crab spawning in the Delaware Bay”. Data supports the hypothesis that abundance of horseshoe crab eggs on beaches such as in the Delaware Bay drive movement and distribution of red knots, and the number of horseshoe crabs in the Delaware Bay characterize its importance/ relevance to their migration route. Other stopover spots in the US include islands off the coast of Massachusetts, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia. Fewer red knots undergo overland migration routes and winter on the Gulf Coast. Stopover areas on this route are found in the Mississippi river drainage, Northern U.S. saline lakes, and plains in Southern Canada.

=== Dependence on horseshoe crab eggs as food source ===
Red knots undergo various physiological changes before their migration to account for the physical demand of the long expedition: “flight muscle mass increases, while leg muscle mass decreases. Stomach and gizzard masses decrease, while fat mass increases by more than 50 percent”. They arrive at stopover sites extremely thin. Since the gizzard is shrunken for their travel, fewer hard foods are eaten and instead soft and nutritious horseshoe crab eggs are the desired food source. As the migration is timed with the release of eggs, they are widely available in these specific stop over locations, making the resource easy to locate and digest, saving the birds energy. Thus, the abundance and accessibility of horseshoe crab eggs at these specific locations justify their intertwined relationship. Body weight may be up to doubled during stopover stays lasting around 10–14 days from constant consumption of food to increase their body fat enough to continue the remainder of their trip. The abundant horseshoe crab population inhabiting the Delaware bay deems it the most important stopover habitat in the red knots migration “supporting an estimated 50 to 80 percent of all migrating rufa red knots each year”.

Because of the interrelatedness between horseshoe crab egg abundance and red knot viability, the health of the horseshoe crab population is increasingly relevant in the discussion of red knot population fluctuation and success. Horseshoe crabs were harvested for fertilizer and to feed animals in the early 20th century, and currently are harvested for bait usage by U.S. fishing companies. Horseshoe crab populations took a toll, and red knot population “numbers in Tierra del Fuego (winter) and Delaware bay (spring) declined about 75 percent from 1980s to 2000s”. Overharvesting of the crabs in the 1990s provoked the action for population management by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to establish “mandatory state-by state harvest quotas and [create] the 1,500-square-mile Carl N. Shuster Jr. Horseshoe Crab Sanctuary off the mouth of Delaware bay.” Subsequently, commercial horseshoe crab bait use has been reduced by population management and innovative bait conservation techniques, and a correlated stabilization in knot populations has been recorded as well.

== Status ==
The red knot has an extensive range, estimated at , and a large population of about 1.1 million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. However many local declines have been noted such as the dredging of intertidal flats for edible cockles (&quot;Cerastoderma edule&quot;) which led to reductions in the wintering of &quot;islandica&quot; in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The quality of food at migratory stopover sites is a critical factor in their migration strategy.

This is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. This commits signatories to regulate the taking of listed species or their eggs, to establish protected areas to conserve habitats for the listed species, to regulate hunting and to monitor the populations of the birds concerned.

Knot populations appear to have stabilized in recent years, though at low levels.

== Threats ==
Red knot populations are greatly affected by climate change since middle and high arctic habitats are necessary for breeding. Higher latitudes and coastal areas where red knots breed and winter are most affected by climate change. Nesting sites are generally on open ground in the tundra near water. Male knots prepare 3–5 sites for nests on “normally dry, stony areas of tundra in upland areas, often near ridges and not far from wetlands”. Thus, sea level rise, coastal erosion, and general warming temperatures due to global warming destroy the ideal breeding habitats for the red knot in these arctic coastal regions. Migratory animals by nature have adapted to various environments. Subsequently, rapid and complex responses to climate change are prominent and in the case of the red knot in the recent changing climate, evolutionarily damaging. As arctic breeding grounds continue to warm, red knot body size has decreased, and less success for survival of birds born in warmer years is reported. Even more significantly, their wintering areas in the tropics have become more stabilized, resulting in shorter bill birds (likely due to the fact that stable conditions breed greater ecological success and less variability within species). Consequently, knots struggle to reach their main food sources which include deeply buried mollusks, adding to lesser access to food as well as more expenditure of energy in attempting to attain food.

Indirect threats including horseshoe crab over harvesting and climate change greatly threaten red knot populations. Issues such as climate change may be harder to immediately/directly alter, yet limiting horseshoe crab harvest and human disturbance to protect knot food sources and migratory/breeding sites are effective methods of conservation for the red knot.

== Conservation efforts ==
In 2003, scientists projected that at its current rate of decline the American subspecies, rufa, might become extinct as early as 2010, but as of April 2011 the subspecies is still extant. In New Jersey, state and local agencies are taking steps to protect these birds by limiting horseshoe crab harvesting and restricting beach access. In Delaware, a two-year ban on the harvesting of horseshoe crabs was enacted but struck down by a judge who cited insufficient evidence to justify the potential disruption to the fishing industry but a male-only harvest has been in place in recent years.

Late in the fall of 2014, the red knot rufa was listed as a federally threatened species under the United States Endangered Species Act – the second most critical status that can be awarded to a subspecies. This followed a decade of intensive petitioning by environmental groups and a lawsuit against the Department of the Interior for alleged negligence in the protection of endangered species through failure to evaluate and list them. The reasons for the red knot rufa&#x27;s listing were varied; habitat degradation, loss of key food supplies, and threats posed by climate change and sea level rise were all listed as factors that were considered when the red knot rufa was listed.

<text>Baia Mare ( , ; ; ; ) is a city along the Săsar River, in northwestern Romania; it is the capital of Maramureș County. The city lies in the region of Maramureș, a subregion of Transylvania. It is situated about from Bucharest, from the border with Hungary, and from the border with Ukraine.

Located south of the and Gutâi mountains, Baia Mare had a population of 108,759 at the 2021 census, and a metropolitan area home to about 200,000 residents. The city administers four villages: Blidari (&quot;Kőbánya&quot;), Firiza (&quot;Felsőfernezely&quot;), Valea Borcutului (&quot;Borpatak&quot;), and Valea Neagră (&quot;Feketepatak&quot;). Baia Mare was named the Romanian Youth Capital from 2 May 2018 to 1 May 2019.

Baia Mare is the greenest municipality in Romania, with 133 square meters of green space for each inhabitant.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
The city&#x27;s development on the middle course of Săsar River, in the middle of a plateau with a warm Mediterranean-like climate, has facilitated living conditions since the Palaeolithic.

=== Ancient times ===
During the Bronze Age the region was inhabited by Thracian tribes. Later, it was included in the Dacian Kingdom formed by the King Burebista when the mining exploration began, as the area is rich in gold and silver.

=== Middle Ages ===
Baia Mare is first mentioned in written documents released by Charles I of Hungary in 1328 under the name of &quot;Rivulus Dominarum&quot; (). In 1347 the town was identified in documents by Louis I of Hungary as an important medieval town with a prosperous mining industry. Its rules of organisation were characteristic of the &quot;free towns&quot; of that time. In 1411 the town and its surrounding areas, including the mines, were transferred into the property of the Hunyadi family by Sigismund, King of Hungary (later also Holy Roman Emperor), who recognised Janos Hunyadi&#x27;s contribution to stop the Turkish invasion of Europe.

The town went into a period of prosperity, during which the St. Stephen Cathedral was built. Today the cathedral tower is one of the best-known of the town&#x27;s historic landmarks (see Stephen&#x27;s Tower). The first school, named &quot;Schola Rivulina&quot;, was opened in Baia Mare in 1547 by the Reformed Church following the Protestant Reformation.

=== Modern period ===

In 1703 Pintea Viteazul and his band managed to free the town for a short period of time from the German Imperial rule, under which it belonged the royal treasury. Since then Pintea is considered an important figure in the town&#x27;s history, representing the idea of freedom. The Budești Church has Pintea&#x27;s chain mail shirt and a helmet, reportedly worn by him in his battles. The Museum of Baia Mare displays his weapons and their harness.

In 1748 the city&#x27;s mining industry made a leap forward when the Austrian authorities created the headquarters of &quot;Superior Mining&quot;.

In the late nineteenth century, Simon Hollósy, István Réti, János Thorma, Béla Iványi-Grünwald, and Károly Ferenczy were among numerous young Hungarians who left the area to study the arts in Munich, as Hungary lacked an academy of art in those times. Simon Hollósy, the young Hungarian painter, was teaching in his studio new western European techniques.

Some of those young painters decided to settle down together in Baia Mare, then called Nagybánya, to work on art. They persuaded Hollósy to join them and founded the Nagybánya artists&#x27; colony, working on naturalism and &quot;plein air&quot; painting. The artists&#x27; colony became known later on for influencing the development of twentieth-century Hungarian and Romanian art. Works by each of these important painters is held by the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest, which in 2009 opened the exhibit, &quot;Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914&quot;, 2 Oct 2009 - Jan 2010. In addition, in 1966 the museum held a major exhibition of their work: &quot;The Art of Nagybánya. Centennial Exhibition in Celebration of the Artists&#x27; Colony in Nagybánya&quot;.

Following World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved, and in 1920, Baia Mare officially became part of the Kingdom of Romania. It became part of Hungary again in 1940 by the Second Vienna Award, until the end of World War II. Near the end of that period, the city hosted the Baia Mare ghetto. After the war, the city was returned to Romania. Shortly after World War II in postwar development, the town of Baia Mare started to grow both in population and inhabited area. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new town centre was developed with modern architecture buildings and structures.

====Cyanide spill====
On 30 January 2000, Baia Mare was the site of what has been considered Europe&#x27;s worst ecological disaster since Chernobyl, which took place at gold mining company Aurul, a joint-venture of the Australian company Esmeralda Exploration and the Romanian government. The tailing dam at the gold processing plant broke and 70 tons of toxic cyanide and heavy metal-laced waste water escaped into the River Tisza and into Hungary, making its way into the Danube and affecting Romania, Hungary, Ukraine, Serbia, and Bulgaria. More than 1,400 tons of fish, numerous eagles, storks and otters died. Scientists fear the release may have led to the ultimate extinction of at least five fish species. Despite the accident&#x27;s happening in Romania, much of the adverse effects were suffered in Hungary. The accident prompted Hungary to ban the use of cyanide in gold processing and it has urged the rest of Europe to do the same.

Since 2013, local Romanian (Romani) businessman Daniel Boldor has been operating out of the CUPROM mine and refinery outside of Baia Mare, selling what he claims are under-extracted Ore concentrate shipments to international metal traders in China, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States. Based on claims that the material was, in fact, worthless mining sludge, the public prosecutor&#x27;s office in Constanța filed an indictment against Boldor in June 2018 on charges of money laundering, customs fraud, document forgery, the collection and transport of hazardous waste, and tax evasion.

====Roma wall====
In 2011, the local administration built a 1.8m-tall wall between the road Strada Horea and an area of social housing that houses 1000 Roma people into one-room apartments, some without water or electricity. According to the mayor, this wall was designed to &quot;prevent traffic accidents&quot;, while pro-democracy organizations say it amounts to a &quot;roma wall&quot; and &quot;institutionalized racism&quot;.

In 2011, the national anti-discrimination council fined mayor Cătălin Cherecheș for the building of the wall and ordered it to be pulled down.

The wall nevertheless proved popular with the majority population and the mayor was overwhelmingly re-elected in 2012.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms of Baia Mare was granted to the city by the Government in the late 1990s, early 2000s, some years after the communist symbols established in 1968 were de facto out of use starting 1989.

The shield is party per pale. In dexter, gules a miner in a mine argent, in sinister, azure a church tower or. The shield is topped by a mural crown with seven towers.

The miner refers to the main local economical activity. The church tower refers to the local cultural/ecclesiastical tradition. The crest shows the city&#x27;s status as a county seat.

==Geography==
The city is situated in the vicinity of the Gutâi and mountains. Altitudes reach in some peaks. The area is famous for its outstanding landscapes, and the mountains are easily accessible from the city, notable routes being: Igniș (1,307 m), Mogoșa (1,246 m), Gutâi (1,443 m), Creasta Cocoșului (1,450 m), Piatra Șoimului (839 m), Pleștioara (803 m), Dealul Bulat (683 m), Murgau (633 m), Dealul Crucii (500 m), etc.

The city is situated in the Baia Mare valley and is encircled on all sides by hills and mountains, which makes the climate in the city milder than the rest of the surrounding area. Proof of this is that the outskirts of Baia Mare are the only areas where you can find chestnut trees that usually need Mediterranean climate to grow. This is the northernmost reach of the chestnut tree. However, abrupt temperature changes take place and, during the winters, the temperatures may occasionally drop below -20 degrees Celsius.

The summers are mild, cooler than in the rest of the country. The precipitations in this area are quite high, due to the mountains in the north and east which do not allow the air masses to pass beyond the region&#x27;s limits, the average rainfall being almost 1,000 mm/year. The city of Baia Mare is the most populous of northern Romanian cities (Satu Mare, Suceava, and Botoșani), with a population of approximately 109,000. It also has a high level of culture and education, being home to theatres, schools, museums and art galleries.

<doc id="312719" wikidata="Q157638" url="?curid=312719" title="Frankfurt National Assembly">
<text>The Frankfurt National Assembly () was the first freely elected parliament for all German states, including the German-populated areas of the Austrian Empire, elected on 1 May 1848 (see German federal election, 1848).

The session was held from 18 May 1848 to 30 May 1849 in the Paulskirche at Frankfurt am Main. Its existence was both part of and the result of the &quot;March Revolution&quot; within the states of the German Confederation.

After long and controversial debates, the assembly produced the so-called Frankfurt Constitution (&quot;Paulskirchenverfassung&quot; or St. Paul&#x27;s Church Constitution, officially the &quot;Verfassung des Deutschen Reiches&quot;) which proclaimed a German Empire based on the principles of parliamentary democracy. This constitution fulfilled the main demands of the liberal and nationalist movements of the Vormärz and provided a foundation of basic rights, both of which stood in opposition to Metternich&#x27;s system of Restoration. The parliament also proposed a constitutional monarchy headed by a hereditary emperor (&quot;Kaiser&quot;).

The Prussian king Frederick William IV refused to accept the office of &quot;Emperor of the Germans&quot; when it was offered to him on the grounds that such a constitution and such an offer were an abridgment of the rights of the princes of the individual German states. In the 20th century, however, major elements of the Frankfurt constitution became models for the Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949.

== Background ==

=== Napoleonic upheavals and German Confederation ===

In 1806, the Emperor Francis II had relinquished the crown of the Holy Roman Empire and dissolved the Empire. This was the result of the Napoleonic Wars and of direct military pressure from Napoléon Bonaparte.

After the victory of Prussia, the United Kingdom, Imperial Russia, and other states over Napoléon in 1815, the Congress of Vienna created the German Confederation (&quot;Deutscher Bund&quot;). The Austrian Empire dominated this system of loosely connected, independent states, but the system failed to account for the rising influence of Prussia. After the so-called &quot;Wars of Liberation&quot; (&quot;Befreiungskriege&quot;, the German term for the German part of the War of the Sixth Coalition), many contemporaries had expected a nation-state solution and thus considered the subdivision of Germany as unsatisfactory.

Apart from this nationalist component, calls for civic rights influenced political discourse. The Napoleonic &quot;Code Civil&quot; had led to the introduction of civic rights in some German states in the early 19th century. Furthermore, some German states had adopted constitutions after the foundation of the German Confederacy. Between 1819 and 1830, the Carlsbad Decrees and other instances of Restoration politics limited such developments. The unrest that resulted from the 1830 French July Revolution led to a temporary reversal of that trend, but after the demonstration for civic rights and national unity at the 1832 Hambach Festival, and the abortive attempt at an armed rising in the 1833 &quot;Frankfurter Wachensturm&quot;, the pressure on representatives of constitutional or democratic ideas was raised through measures such as censorship and bans on public assemblies.

=== The 1840s ===

The 1840s began with the Rhine Crisis, a primarily diplomatic scandal caused by the threat from the French prime minister Adolphe Thiers to invade Germany in a dispute between Paris and the four other Great Powers (including Austria and Prussia) over the Middle East. The threat alarmed the German Confederate Diet (&quot;Bundesversammlung&quot;), which was made up of representatives of the individual princes, and the only institution representing the whole German Confederation. The Diet voted to extend the Fortresses of the German Confederation (&quot;Bundesfestungen&quot;) at Mainz, Ulm, and Rastatt, while the Kingdom of Bavaria developed the fortress at Germersheim. Patriotic feelings of the public were effectively captured in the poem &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot; (&quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;) by Max Schneckenburger, and in songs such as &quot;Der Deutsche Rhein&quot; and the &quot;Lied der Deutschen&quot;, the national anthem of Germany since 1922.

The mid-1840s saw an increased frequency of internal crises. This was partially the result of large-scale political developments, such as the escalation of the Schleswig-Holstein Question and the erection of the &quot;Bundesfestungen&quot;. Additionally, a series of bad harvests in parts of Germany, notably the southwest, led to widely spread famine-related unrest in 1845 and 1846. The changes caused by the beginnings of industrialization exacerbated social and economic tensions considerably, especially in Saxony and Silesia.

Meanwhile in the reform-oriented states, such as Baden, the development of a lively scene of &quot;Vereine&quot; (clubs or voluntary associations) provided an organizational framework for democratic, or popular, opposition. Especially in Southwest Germany, censorship could not effectively suppress the press. At such rallies as the Offenburg Popular Assembly of September 1847, radical democrat was called to overthrow the &quot;status quo&quot;. At the same time, the bourgeois opposition had increased its networking activities and began coordinating its activities in the individual chamber parliaments more and more confidently. Thus, at the Heppenheim Conference on 10 October 1847, eighteen liberal members from a variety of German states met to discuss common motions for a German nation-state.

In Prussia, King Frederick William IV finally approved the assembly of a &quot;United Diet&quot; promised by his father in the decree of 22 May 1815. This body was commanded to debate and vote only on taxes and loans. However, as soon as it opened in April 1847, its members began discussions of press freedoms, voting, and human rights, the power to introduce legislation and foreign policy. After eleven weeks, the United Diet rejected a loan request. The King closed the diet in disgust and refused to say when it would be reopened. However, the people&#x27;s enthusiasm for the United Diet was undeniable, and it was clear that a new political age was dawning. Many of the most eloquent members of the United Diet would play important roles in the future Frankfurt Parliament.

Between 1846 and 1848, broader European developments aggravated this tension. The Peasant Uprising in Galicia in February and March 1846 was a revolt against serfdom, directed against manorial property and social oppression. Rioting Galician peasants killed some 1,000 noblemen and destroyed about 500 manors. Despite its failure, the uprising was seen by some scholars, including Karl Marx, as a &quot;deeply democratic movement that aimed at land reform and other pressing social questions.&quot; The uprising was praised by Marx and Friedrich Engels for being &quot;the first in Europe to plant the banner of social revolution&quot;, and seen as a precursor to the coming Spring of Nations. At the same time, the suppression of the Free City of Cracow in the midst of the uprising aroused the emotions of nationalists in Germany as much as in Poland.

In Switzerland, the Sonderbund War of November 1847 saw the swift defeat of the conservative Catholic cantons and victory for the radical left-wing in the Protestant cantons. Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich had pondered military intervention and later regretted not doing so, blaming the resulting waves of revolution on the Swiss.

Three months later, revolutionary workers and students in France deposed the &quot;Citizen King&quot; Louis-Philippe I in the February Revolution; their action resulted in the declaration of the Second Republic. In many European states, the resistance against Restoration policies increased and led to revolutionary unrest. In several parts of the Austrian Empire, namely in Hungary, Bohemia, Romania, and throughout Italy, in particular in Sicily, Rome, and Northern Italy, there were bloody revolts, replete with calls for local or regional autonomy and even for national independence.

Friedrich Daniel Bassermann, a liberal deputy in the second chamber of the parliament of Baden, helped to trigger the final impulse for the election of a pan-German assembly (or parliament). On 12 February 1848, referring to his own motion (&quot;Motion Bassermann&quot;) in 1844 and a comparable one by Carl Theodor Welcker in 1831, he called for a representation, elected by the people, in the Confederate Diet. Two weeks later, news of the successful revolution in France fanned the flames of the revolutionary mood. The revolution on German soil began in Baden, with the occupation of the &quot;Ständehaus&quot; at Karlsruhe. This was followed in April by the &quot;Heckerzug&quot; (named after its leader, Friedrich Hecker), the first of three revolutionary risings in the Grand Duchy. Within a few days and weeks, the revolts spread to the other German states.

=== The March Revolution ===

The central demands of the German opposition(s) were the granting of basic and civic rights regardless of property requirements, the appointment of liberal governments in the individual states and most importantly the creation of a German nation-state, with a pan-German constitution and a popular assembly. On 5 March 1848, opposition politicians and state deputies met at the Heidelberg Assembly to discuss these issues. They resolved to form a pre-parliament (&quot;Vorparlament&quot;), which was to prepare the elections for a national constitutional assembly. They also elected a &quot;Committee of Seven&quot; (&quot;Siebenerausschuss&quot;), which proceeded to invite 500 individuals to Frankfurt.

This development was accompanied and supported since early March by protest rallies and risings in many German states, including Baden, the Kingdom of Bavaria, the Kingdom of Saxony, the Kingdom of Württemberg, Austria and Prussia. Under such pressure, the individual princes recalled the existing conservative governments and replaced them with more liberal committees, the so-called &quot;March Governments&quot; (&quot;Märzregierungen&quot;). On 10 March 1848, the Bundestag of the German Confederation appointed a &quot;Committee of Seventeen&quot; (&quot;Siebzehnerausschuss&quot;) to prepare a draft constitution; on 20 March, the Bundestag urged the states of the confederation to call elections for a constitutional assembly. After bloody street fights (&quot;Barrikadenaufstand&quot;) in Prussia, a Prussian National Assembly was also convened, with the task of preparing a constitution for that kingdom.

=== The Pre-Parliament ===

The Pre-Parliament (&quot;Vorparlament&quot;) was in session at the St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Frankfurt am Main (&quot;Paulskirche&quot;) in Frankfurt from 31 March to 3 April, chaired by Carl Joseph Anton Mittermaier. With the support of the moderate liberals, and against the opposition of the radical democrats, it decided to cooperate with the German Confederate Diet (&quot;Bundestag&quot;), to form a national constitutional assembly which would write a new constitution. For the transitional period until the actual formation of that assembly, the &quot;Vorparlament&quot; formed the Committee of Fifty (&quot;Fünfzigerausschuss&quot;), as a representation to face the German Confederation.

Though the pre-parliament had decided on 13 May 1848 for the opening of the National Assembly, the date was pushed to 18 May so that deputies from Prussia&#x27;s outer provinces, which had only recently joined the Confederation, could arrive in time. By this calculation, the number of Prussian deputies to parliament was increased.

==== Preparing for the Elections ====
According to the pre-parliament&#x27;s rules for elections, one deputy was to be seated for every 50,000 inhabitants within the Confederation, totaling some 649 jurisdictions (see this list of deputies at the opening of the parliament or list of all deputies on German Wikipedia).

The actual elections to the National Assembly depended on the laws of the individual states, which varied considerably. Württemberg, Holstein, the Electorate of Hesse (Hesse-Kassel) and the four remaining free cities (Hamburg, Lübeck, Bremen and Frankfurt) held direct elections. Most states chose an indirect procedure, usually involving a first round, voting to constitute an Electoral college which chose the actual deputies in a second round. There also were different arrangements regarding the right to vote, as the Frankfurt guidelines only stipulated that voters should be independent (&quot;selbständig&quot;) adult males. The definition of independence was handled differently from state to state and was frequently the subject of vociferous protests. Usually, it was interpreted to exclude the recipients of any poverty-related support, but in some areas, it also barred any person who did not have a household of their own, including apprentices living at their masters&#x27; homes. Even with restrictions, however, it is estimated that about 85% of the male population could vote. In Prussia, the definition used would have pushed this up to 90%, whereas the laws were much more restrictive in Saxony, Baden, and Hanover. The boycott in Austria&#x27;s Czech majority areas and complications in Tiengen (Baden), (where the leader of the &quot;Heckerzug&quot; rebellion, Freidrich Hecker, in exile in Switzerland, was elected in two rounds) caused disruptions.

== Organisation of the &quot;Nationalversammlung&quot; ==
On 18 May 1848, 379 deputies assembled in the Kaisersaal and walked solemnly to the Paulskirche to hold the first session of the German national assembly, under its chairman (by seniority) Friedrich Lang. Heinrich von Gagern, one of the best-known liberals throughout Germany, was elected president of the parliament. (See this List of deputies that attended the opening of the parliament.)

=== Assembly in the St. Paul&#x27;s Church ===

The evangelical community of Frankfurt provided St. Paul&#x27;s Church (&quot;Paulskirche&quot;) to the Pre-Parliament, which in turn became the home of the National Assembly. The altar was removed and a lectern was put in place for the presidium and the speaker, while the church organ was hidden by the large painting &quot; Germania&quot;. On either side of the gallery was the library. Despite its large capacity, which allowed the sitting of 600 deputies and a gallery for 2,000 spectators, there were some disadvantages. St. Paul&#x27;s Church had extremely narrow corridors between the rows of seats in the central hall, and there were no rooms for consultation by the committees. The gallery attendees quickly became famous for their noise during the debates, which the more eloquent deputies learned to abuse to gain applause for themselves or raucous blame upon their enemies.

=== Form and Function of the Parliament ===
The Committee of Fifty that emerged from the Pre-parliament could have drafted Rules of Procedure for the National Assembly but rejected doing so on 29 April 1848. Therefore, Robert Mohl worked out his draft with two other deputies. The draft was completed on 10 May and adopted as regulation at the first sitting of the Parliament on 18 May. A commission was set up to draft the definitive rules of procedure on 29 May, which was adopted following a short debate. Six sections with 49 paragraphs regulated the electoral test, the board and staff of the assembly, quorum (set at 200 deputies), the formation of committees, order of debate, and inputs and petitions.

Among other things, the rules of procedure provided that the meetings were public but could be confidential under certain conditions. In the 15 committees, the subjects of negotiation were pre-deliberated. It was settled on how applications were to be handled (twenty votes were needed for the plenary presentation) and that the agenda was fixed by the President at the end of the previous session. Deputies spoke in the order in which they answered but with a change from opponents and supporters of the bill. Speaking time was unlimited. Twenty deputies together could request the conclusion of a debate, at which the decision was then in plenary. There were no seating arrangements, but the deputies soon arranged themselves according to their political affiliations, from left and right.

By formal change or simple use, the Rules of Procedure could be modified. Political factions largely determined the speakers in a debate. A name roll call had to take place if at least fifty deputies demanded it; Speaker Friedrich Bassermann wanted to allow this only when needed because of uncertainty over the vote, but opponents saw in the roll call a means of documenting how the deputies voted. Finally, to save time, on 17 October 1848 voting cards were introduced (white &quot;yes&quot;, blue &quot;no&quot;) as a means of true documentation.

By the Rules of Procedure, an absolute majority of deputies present elected the President and the two Vice-Presidents of the National Assembly. A new election of officers was held every four weeks, as Robert von Mohl had suggested. The President maintained order in the session, set the agenda, and led the meeting. The overall board also included eight secretaries, who were jointly elected by a relative majority for the entire term. A panel of twelve stenographers wrote down all discussions in every session and withdrew in the evening to compare notes. They were assisted by 13 clerks. Final copies of the daily sessions were printed for the public two or three days later, though by the time of the Rump Parliament, printings were up to ten days late. Furthermore, the staff consisted of messengers and servants.

=== Presidents of the National Assembly ===
*Friedrich Lang as president by seniority (18 May 1848 until 19 May 1848)
*Heinrich von Gagern (19 May 1848 until 16 December 1848)
*Eduard Simson (18 December 1848 until 11 May 1849)
*Theodor Reh (12 May 1849 until 30 May 1849)
*Friedrich Wilhelm Löwe as president of the Stuttgart rump parliament (6 June 1849 until 18 June 1849)

=== Calculating the number of deputies ===
The Pre-Parliament had set the ratio of one deputy to the National Assembly per 50,000 inhabitants of the German Confederation, totaling 649 deputies. However, Czech-majority constituencies in Bohemia and Moravia boycotted the election, reducing the total to 585. As many deputies held multiple assignments in state parliaments or government offices, this reduced the average daily attendance to between 400 and 450 members. For important ballots, up to 540 deputies might attend to cast their vote. In April 1849, there were on average 436 deputies each sitting before the Austrian deputies were recalled (see below).

Because of resignations and replacements, the total number of deputies who served between 18 May 1848 and 17 June 1849 has never been determined satisfactorily. Historian Jörg-Detlef Kühne counted a total of 799 deputies, while Thomas Nipperdey reckoned a high figure of 830. In the middle, Wolfram Siemann counted 812 deputies and Christian Jansen 809, which are the most popular figures. The discrepancy may be due to the chaotic conditions of the elections, where disputes over constituencies and the conduct of the elections caused the late sitting of some deputies. Adjustments to the &quot;Demarkationslinie&quot; in the Grand Duchy of Posen created new constituencies and new deputies as late as February 1849 (see below). Finally, the passage of the Austrian Constitution in March 1849 convinced a few Czech deputies who had boycotted the National Assembly to appear, if only in moral opposition. For these reasons, the total number of deputies may never be settled.

=== Social background of the deputies ===
The social makeup of the deputies was very homogeneous throughout the session. The parliament mostly represented the educated bourgeoisie. 95% of deputies had the &quot;abitur&quot;, more than three-quarters had been to university, half of which had studied jurisprudence. A considerable number of deputies were members of a &quot;Corps&quot; or a &quot;Burschenschaft&quot;. In terms of profession, upper-level civil servants formed the majority: this group included a total of 436 deputies, including 49 university lecturers or professors, 110 judges or prosecutors, and 115 high administrative clerks and district administrators (&quot;Landräte&quot;). Due to their oppositional views, many of them had already conflicted with their princes for several years, including professors such as Jacob Grimm, Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, Georg Gottfried Gervinus and Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht (all counted among the Göttingen Seven), and politicians such as Welcker and Itzstein who had been champions of constitutional rights for two decades. Among the professors, besides lawyers, experts in German Studies and historians were especially common, because under the sway of restoration politics, academic meetings in such disciplines, e.g. the &quot;Germanisten-Tage&quot; of 1846 and 1847, were often the only occasions where national themes could be discussed freely. Apart from those mentioned above, the academic Ernst Moritz Arndt, Johann Gustav Droysen, Carl Jaup, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, Bruno Hildebrand and Georg Waitz are especially notable.

Because of this composition, the National Assembly was later often dismissively dubbed the &quot;Professorenparlament&quot; (&quot;Professors&#x27; parliament&quot;) and ridiculed with verses such as &quot;Dreimal 100 Advokaten – Vaterland, du bist verraten; dreimal 100 Professoren – Vaterland, du bist verloren!&quot; &quot;Three times 100 lawyers – Fatherland, you are betrayed; three times 100 professors – Fatherland, you are doomed&quot;.

149 deputies were self-employed bourgeois professionals, such as lawyers, doctors, journalists or clergymen, including well-known politicians such as Alexander von Soiron, Johann Jacoby, Karl Mathy, Johann Gustav Heckscher, Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler and Wilhelm Murschel.

The economically active middle class was represented by only about 60 deputies, including many publishers, including Bassermann and Georg Friedrich Kolb, but also businessmen, industrialists and bankers, such as Hermann Henrich Meier, Ernst Merck, Hermann von Beckerath, Gustav Mevissen and Carl Mez.

Tradesmen and representatives of agriculture were very poorly represented – the latter were mostly represented by big landowners from east of the Elbe, accompanied by only three farmers. Craftsmen like Robert Blum or Wilhelm Wolff were associated almost exclusively with the radical democratic Left, as they knew the social problems of the underprivileged classes from personal observations. A few of them, e.g. Wolff already saw themselves as explicit socialists.

A further striking aspect is the large number of well-known writers among the deputies, including Anastasius Grün, Johann Ludwig Uhland, Heinrich Laube and Victor Scheffel.

=== Factions and committees ===
In his opening speech on 19 May 1848, Gagern defined the main tasks of the national assembly as the creation of a &quot;constitution for Germany&quot; and the achievement of German unification. This was followed by a total of 230 sessions, supported by 26 committees and five commissions, in the course of which the deputies developed the Frankfurt Constitution.

While the opening session had generally been quite chaotic, with the deputies seated haphazardly, independent of their political affiliations, ordered parliamentary procedures developed quickly. Soon, deputies started assembling in &quot;Klubs&quot; (clubs), which served as discussion groups for kindred spirits and led to the development of &quot;Fraktionen&quot; (Parliamentary groups or factions), a necessary prerequisite for the development of political majorities. These &quot;Fraktionen&quot; were perceived as clubs and thus usually named after the location of their meetings; generally, they were quite unstable. According to their stances, especially on the constitution, the powers of parliament, and central government as opposed to individual states, they are broadly divided into three basic camps:
# The &quot;democratic left&quot; (&quot;demokratische Linke&quot;)—also called the &quot;Ganzen&quot; (&quot;the whole ones&quot;) in contemporary jargon—consisting of the extreme and the moderate left (the Deutscher Hof group and its later split-offs Donnersberg, Nürnberger Hof and Westendhall).
# The &quot;liberal center&quot;—the so-called &quot;Halben&quot; (&quot;Halves&quot;)—consisting of the left and right center (the right-wing liberal Casino and the left-wing liberal Württemberger Hof, and the later split-offs Augsburger Hof, Landsberg and Pariser Hof).
# The &quot;conservative right&quot;, composed of Protestants and conservatives (first Steinernes Haus, later Café Milani).

The largest groupings in numerical terms were the Casino, the Württemberger Hof, and beginning in 1849 the combined left, appearing as the &quot;Centralmärzverein&quot; (&quot;Central March Club&quot;).

In his memoirs, the deputy Robert von Mohl wrote about the formation and functioning of the Clubs:

== Provisional central power ==


Since the national assembly had not been initiated by the German Confederation, it was lacking not only major constitutional bodies, such as a head of state and a government, but also legal legitimation. A modification of the &quot;Bundesakte&quot;, the constitution of the German Confederation could have brought about such legitimation, but was practically impossible to achieve, as it would have required the unanimous support of all 38 signatory states. Partially for this reason, influential European powers, including France and Russia, declined to recognize the Parliament. While the left demanded to solve this situation by creating a revolutionary parliamentary government, the center and right acted to create a monarchy.

===Formation of the Central Power===
On 24 June 1848, Heinrich von Gagern argued for a regency and provisional central government to carry out parliamentary decisions. On 28 June 1848, the Paulskirche parliament voted, with 450 votes against 100, for the so-called Provisional Central Power (&quot;Provisorische Zentralgewalt&quot;). The next day, 29 June, the Parliament cast votes for candidates to be the &quot;Reichsverweser&quot; or Regent of the Empire, a temporary head of state. In the final tally, Archduke John of Austria gained 436 votes, Heinrich von Gagern received 52 votes, John Adam von Itzstein got 32 votes, and Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary only 1 vote. The office of Regent was declared &quot;irresponsible&quot;, meaning the Regent could not govern except through his ministers, who were responsible to the Parliament.

The Parliament then dispatched a deputation to the Archduke to present the honor bestowed upon him. However, the Confederate Diet (&quot;Bundesversammlung&quot;) sent their own letter, which the Archduke received prior to the parliamentary deputation, informing him that the princes of the Confederation had nominated him Regent before the Parliament had done so. The implication was that the Regent should receive his power from the princes rather than the revolutionaries, but the practical effect of this power was yet to be seen.

The Archduke received the delegation on 5 July 1848 and accepted the position, stating, however, that he could not undertake full responsibility in Frankfurt until he had finished his current work of opening the Austrian Parliament in Vienna. Therefore, Archduke John drove to Frankfurt where he was sworn in as Regent on the morning of 12 July 1848 in the Paulskirche, and then crossed over to the Thurn and Taxis Palace to deliver a speech to the Confederate Diet, which then declared the end of its work and delegated its responsibilities to the Regent. Archduke John returned to Vienna on 17 July to finish his tasks there.

=== Practical tasks of the Provisional Central Power ===
The practical tasks of the Provisional Central Power were performed by a cabinet, consisting of a college of ministers under the leadership of a prime minister (&quot;Ministerpräsident&quot;). At the same time, the Provisional Central Power undertook to create a government apparatus, made up of specialized ministries and special envoys, employing, for financial reasons, mainly deputies of the assembly. The goal was to have a functional administration in place at the time of the Constitution&#x27;s passage. Whatever form the final government of united Germany was to take would be defined by the Constitution, and necessary changes to the Provisional Central Power would be made accordingly. Significantly, the terms of the Regent&#x27;s service explicitly forbade him or his ministers from interfering in the formulation of the Constitution.

On 15 July 1848, the Regent appointed his first government under prime minister Prince Carl zu Leiningen, the maternal half-brother of Queen Victoria of Great Britain. Ministers of the Interior, Justice, War, and Foreign Affairs were appointed on the same day, while Ministers for Finance and Trade were appointed on 5 August.

At the end of August 1848, there were a total of 26 persons employed in the administration of the provisional government. By 15 February 1849, the number had increased to 105. Some 35 of them worked in the War Department and had been employed by the Confederate Diet in the same capacity. The Ministry of Commerce employed 25 staff, including the section in charge of the German Fleet, which was only separated as an independent Naval ministry in May 1849. The diplomatic section employed mostly freelance personnel who held portfolios for state governments.

=== Prime Ministers of the Provisional Government ===
* Anton von Schmerling (15 July 1848 until 5 August 1848)
* Carl zu Leiningen (5. August 1848 until 5 September 1848)
* Anton von Schmerling (24 September 1848 until 15 December 1848)
* Heinrich von Gagern (17 December 1848 until 10 May 1849)
* (16 May 1849 until 3 June 1849)
* (3 June 1849 to 20 December 1849)

=== Relations with the National Assembly ===

As the National Assembly had initiated the creation of the Provisional Central Power, the Regent, and his government were expected to be subservient to their whims. Theoretically, the transfer of the Confederate Diet&#x27;s authority to the Regent on 12 July gave him legitimate, binding power independent of the National Assembly. The Diet&#x27;s rules regarding unanimous decision-making and a &quot;liberum veto&quot; had been a source of weakness when divided among 39 members. But, when concentrated in the hands of one man, it could make him supreme if he chose to be so.

However, the Regent was a man of advanced age who was convinced, like most of his contemporaries, that his office would be of short duration and his role should be strictly an honor. Therefore, the personalities of the Prime Ministers during the life of the Provisional Central Power clearly defined the government during their tenures. Carl zu Leiningen was staunchly anti-Prussian and essentially anti-prince. His family had been mediatized along with hundreds of other nobles in the Napoleonic period, and he expected the remaining princes of Germany to set aside their crowns as well. Anton von Schmerling held contempt for many of the institutions he had dutifully served, such as the Confederate Diet, and considered the National Assembly and his administration to be the future of Germany. Yet, as the National Assembly dragged out its work on the Constitution, the role of the Provisional Central Power changed. Soon, its purpose was to shore up the diminishing legitimacy of the whole project in the eyes of the people and the princes. Heinrich Gagern&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister in December was to serve that purpose, even though relations between the Regent and the former President of the National Assembly were poor.

After the Constitution was rejected by the larger states in April 1849, Gagern came into conflict with the Regent over his refusal to defend the Constitution and resigned. (See &quot;Provisional Rump Parliament and Dissolution&quot; for the conflict between the Provisional Central Power and the National Assembly, and &quot;Aftermath&quot; for the period following.)

== Main political issues ==

=== Schleswig-Holstein Question and development of political camps ===
Influenced by the general nationalist atmosphere, the political situation in Schleswig and Holstein became especially explosive. According to the 1460 Treaty of Ribe, the two duchies were to remain &quot;eternally undivided&quot; and stood in personal union with Denmark. Nonetheless, only Holstein was part of the German Confederation, whereas Schleswig, with a mixed population of German-speakers and Danish speakers, formed a Danish fiefdom. German national liberals and the left demanded that Schleswig be admitted to the German Confederation and be represented at the national assembly, while Danish national liberals wanted to incorporate Schleswig into a new Danish national state. When King Frederick VII announced on 27 March 1848 the promulgation of a liberal constitution under which the duchy, while preserving its local autonomy, would become an integral part of Denmark, the radicals broke into revolt. The Estates of Holstein followed suit. A revolutionary government for the duchies was declared, and an army was hastily formed.

====Opening hostilities====

Denmark landed 7,000 troops near Flensburg on 1 April 1848 to suppress the rebels. The Confederate Diet ordered Prussia to protect the duchies on 4 April and recognized the revolutionary government. But it was only when Denmark ordered its fleet to seize Prussian ships on 19 April that General Friedrich von Wrangel marched his Prussian troops against Danish positions at the &quot;Dannevirke&quot; entrenchment and the city of Schleswig. His columns pushed through Schleswig and seized the key fortress of Fredericia without a struggle on 2 May. All of Jutland lay before Wrangel and the National Assembly urged a swift defeat of the Danes for the sake of Schleswig&#x27;s revolution. But pressure from foreign sources arose from all quarters: Nicholas I of Russia sent sharp warnings to Berlin about respecting the integrity of Denmark, as King Frederick was a cousin of the Tsar. The British were agitated by Prussian aggression. Then, Sweden landed 6,000 troops on the Island of Funen opposite the Duchy of Schleswig.

====Arranging an armistice====
With Prussia threatened by war on several fronts, terms for an armistice were arranged through Swedish mediation at Malmö on 2 July 1848 and the order to cease operations handed to General Wrangel ten days later. However, Wrangel refused to accept the terms, declaring he was under orders &quot;not&quot; from Berlin but from the Confederate Diet, which had just been superseded by the Provisional Central Power. Therefore, he would hold positions and await further orders from the Regent. With popular sentiment on Wrangel&#x27;s side, the Berlin court could not condemn him. They tried to steer a middle course by recognizing Wrangel&#x27;s actions but asked the Regent for direct control of the German Federal Army in order to enforce a peace based on 2 July agreement. The Regent approved, but added extra demands upon the Danes and ordered the 30,000-strong German Confederate VIII. Army Corps to support Wrangel. This infuriated the foreign powers, who dispatched further threats to Berlin.

On 26 August, Prussia, under strong pressure from Britain, Russia, and Sweden, signed a six-month armistice with Denmark at Malmö. Its terms included the withdrawal of all German Confederate soldiers from Schleswig-Holstein and a shared administration of the land. No recognition was made of the Provisional Central Power in the deliberations.

On 5 September, at Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann&#x27;s instigation, the National Assembly initially rejected the Malmö Armistice with a vote of 238 against 221. After that, Prime Minister Leiningen resigned his office. The Regent entrusted Dahlmann to form a new ministry, but his fiery rhetoric over Schleswig-Holstein could not be turned into political capital. The Austrian deputy Anton von Schmerling succeeded Leiningen as Prime Minister.

====The &quot;Septemberunruhen&quot;====

In a second vote, on 16 September 1848, the Assembly accepted the &quot;de facto&quot; position and approved the armistice with a narrow majority. In Frankfurt this led to the &quot;Septemberunruhen&quot; (&quot;September unrest&quot;), a popular rising that entailed the murder of parliamentarians from the Casino faction, Lichnowsky and Auerswald. The Regent was forced to call for the support of Prussian and Austrian troops stationed in the Fortress of Mainz, and these restored order in Frankfurt and the vicinity within two weeks.

Henceforth, the radical democrats, whose views were both leftist and nationalist, ceased to accept their representation through the National Assembly. In several states of the German Confederation, they resorted to individual revolutionary activities. For example, on 21 September, Gustav Struve declared a German republic at Lörrach, thus starting the second democratic rising in Baden. The nationalist unrest in Hungary spread to Vienna in early October, leading to a third revolutionary wave, the &quot;Wiener Oktoberaufstand&quot; (&quot;Vienna October rising&quot;), which further impeded the work of the Assembly.

Thus, the acceptance of the Treaty of Malmö marks the latest possible date of the final breach of cooperation between the liberal and the radical democratic camps. Radical democratic politicians saw it as final confirmation that the bourgeois politicians, as Hecker had said in spring 1848, &quot;&quot;negotiate with the princes&quot; instead of &quot;acting in the name of the sovereign people&quot;&quot;, thus becoming &quot;traitors to the cause of the people&quot;. In contrast, the bourgeois liberals saw the unrests as further proof for what they saw as the short-sighted and irresponsible stance of the left, and of the dangers of a &quot;left-wing mob&quot; spreading anarchy and murder. This early divide of its main components was of major importance for the later failure of the National Assembly, as it caused lasting damage not only to the esteem and acceptance of the parliament, but also to the cooperation among its factions.

=== The German &quot;Reichsflotte&quot; and financial problems ===

Denmark&#x27;s blockade of the North German coast caused deputies of National Assembly to call for the creation of the &quot;Reichsflotte&quot; or Imperial Fleet. The vote passed overwhelmingly on 14 June 1848, and this date is still celebrated as the foundation of the modern German Navy. However, the National Assembly had no funds to disburse for the project. National enthusiasm led to numerous penny-collections across Germany, as well the raising of volunteers to man whatever vessels could be purchased, to be commanded by retired naval officers from coastal German states.

Actual monies for the Navy did not become available until the Confederate Diet dissolved itself on 12 July 1848 and the Federal Fortress budget (&quot;Bundesmatrikularkasse&quot;) came into possession of the Provisional Central Power. The Regent then appointed the Bremen senator Arnold Duckwitz as Minister of the Marine (&quot;Minister für Marineangelegenheiten&quot;) to develop a war fleet with Prince Adalbert of Prussia as Commander in Chief and Karl Brommy as Chief of Operations. Difficulties arose in the procurement and equipment of suitable warships, as the British and Dutch were wary of a new naval power arising in the North Sea, and Denmark pressed its blockade harder. Furthermore, most German states forbade their trained personnel from serving in another navy, even though it was to be for their own common defense.
Nevertheless, by 15 October 1848, three steam corvettes and one sailing frigate were placed into service. In total, two sailing frigates, two steam regattas, six steam corvettes, 26 rowing gunboats, and one hawk ship were procured from diverse places.

In consequence, however, the entire budget inherited from the Confederate Diet was spent. Discussions in the National Assembly for raising funds through taxes were tied into the Constitutional debates, and the Provisional Central Power could not convince the state governments to make any more contributions than what they had agreed upon in the Confederate Diet. Even worse, the chaotic finances of such states as Austria, which was fighting wars in Italy and Hungary and suppressing rebellions in Prague and Vienna, meant little or no payment was to be expected in the near future.

Effectively, the National Assembly and the Provisional Central Power were bankrupt and unable to undertake such rudimentary projects as paying salaries, purchasing buildings, or even publishing notices. The revolution functioned on the financial charity of individual Germans and the good will of the states, which grew thinner as the months passed.

=== The German army and rising confidence of the princes ===
On 12 July 1848, the Confederate Diet transferred responsibility for the German Confederate Army and the Federal Fortresses to the Provisional Central Power. The Regent appointed General Eduard von Peucker, Prussia&#x27;s representative to the Federal Military Commission, as Minister of War.

Anxious to bring the war with Denmark to a victorious conclusion, on 15 July the National Assembly decreed that the German Confederate Army should be doubled in size. This was to be done by raising the proportion of recruits to 2 percent of the population, and also by the abolition of all laws of exemption in the individual States. Not only did the Prussian government complain about interference in its conduct of the Danish war, but the various Chambers of the States published complaints against the Parliament for violating their sovereignty and threatening their already shaky state budgets. Many common people also denounced the idea of an expanded army and conscription.

==== The military parade of 6 August ====
On 16 July, the Minister of War sent a circular to the state Governments with a proclamation to the German troops, in which he decreed the Regent as the highest military authority in Germany. At the same time, he ordered the state governments to call out the troops of every garrison for a parade on 6 August, the 42nd anniversary of the end of the Holy Roman Empire. Their commanding officers were to read Peucker&#x27;s proclamation before them, after which the troops were to shout &quot;Hurrah!&quot; for the Regent three times. Then, the soldiers were to assume the German cockade as a symbol of their allegiance to the new order of things.

In Berlin, King Frederick William issued a decree to the army that on 6 August there was to be no parade anywhere in Prussia. In Vienna, Minister of War Theodore von Latour and the Ministerial Council were indignant at the presumption. Latour demanded a sharp response from the government of Austria, which at that moment was headed by Archduke John in Vienna. Ironically, the Archduke had to dispatch a complaint about the matter in the name of the Austrian government to himself as head of the Provisional Central Power.

Thus, the attempt of the Provisional Central Power to assert its authority over all the armed forces within Germany failed. The Regent still held authority over the German Confederate Army, but this force represented less than half of the standing armies of the states, and these were led by officers whose loyalty remained first and foremost to their sovereign princes.

==== The Cologne cathedral festival ====
On 20 July the Regent, along with Heinrich Gagern and a large deputation from the Parliament, accepted an invitation by King Frederick William to take part in a festival celebrating new construction to the great Cologne Cathedral. The radical left condemned the festival, correctly assuming it would strengthen feelings of loyalty in the people toward their princes. On 15 August, the deputation arrived in Cologne by riverboat. Standing on the quay, the King embraced the Regent to the cheer of the crowds, and then allowed Gagern to present the members of the deputation. He addressed to them a few friendly words on the importance of their work and added with emphasis: &quot;Do not forget that there are still Princes in Germany, and that I am one of them.&quot;

Later, a torchlight parade carried the King and the Regent to the cathedral square, where the crowds showered them with adulation. Gagern, however, missed the parade entirely as it dispersed due to rains before it reached the end of the route where he awaited it. The National Assembly deputies marched in the parade only as one of many groups, flanked by fire-fighters and police. Finally, at the grand banquet afterward, a toast by prominent leftist deputy Franz Raveaux was missed by the royal retinue and other dignitaries, as all of them departed early.

Taken together, these were glaring indications of the revolutionaries&#x27; lessening influence, whereas cheering crowds surrounding the King and Regent amplified the growing confidence of the princes.

=== &quot;Oktoberaufstand&quot; and execution of Blum ===

The Vienna Uprising at the beginning of October forced the Austrian court to flee the city. The National Assembly, instigated by left-wing deputies, attempted to mediate between the Austrian government and the revolutionaries. In the meantime, the Austrian army violently suppressed the rising. In the course of events, the deputy Robert Blum, one of the figureheads of the democratic left, was arrested. General Alfred von Windisch-Grätz ignored Blum&#x27;s parliamentary immunity, tried him before a military tribunal, and had him executed by firing squad on 9 November 1848. This highlighted the powerlessness of the National Assembly and its dependence on the goodwill of the state governments of the German Confederation. In &quot;Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany&quot; (1852), Friedrich Engels wrote:

The fact that fate of the revolution was decided in Vienna and Berlin, that the key issues of life were dealt with in both those capitals without taking the slightest notice of the Frankfurt assembly—that fact alone is sufficient to prove that the institution was a mere debating club, consisting of an accumulation of gullible wretches who allowed themselves to be abused as puppets by the governments, so as to provide a show to amuse the shopkeepers and tradesmen of small states and towns, as long as it was considered necessary to distract their attention.

The execution also indicated that the force of the March Revolution was beginning to flag by the autumn of 1848. This did not apply only to Austria. The power of the governments appointed in March was eroding. In Prussia, the Prussian National Assembly was disbanded and its draft constitution rejected.

=== Defining &quot;Germany&quot; ===

With history, politics, and ethnicity in conflict, defining the meaning of &quot;Germany&quot; was proving a major obstacle for the National Assembly. The biggest problem was that the two most powerful states, Prussia and especially Austria, had large possessions with non-German populations outside the boundaries of the Confederation. Incorporating such areas into a German nation-state not only raised questions regarding the national identity of the inhabitants, but also challenged the relationship between the two states within Germany. At the same time, Denmark and the Netherlands administered sovereign territories within the Confederation, further entangling the question of &quot;Germany&quot; in the affairs of foreign powers.

This problem was partially solved on 11 April 1848, when the Confederate Diet admitted Prussia&#x27;s outer territories (the Province of Prussia and as-yet undefined &quot;German areas&quot; of the Grand Duchy of Posen) into the Confederation. On the same day, Austria&#x27;s Emperor Ferdinand I granted Hungary an independent ministry responsible to the Diet at Pesth, theoretically severing Hungary from Austria&#x27;s German possessions.

Deputy Venedey addressed the &quot;German Question&quot; during a debate on 5 July 1848 in this way: &quot;I am against any other expression, or against any other explanation, than &quot;every German&quot;... In France there are also many nationalities, but all know that they are French. There are also different nationalities in England, and yet all know that they are Englishmen. We want to start by saying that everyone is German. We should therefore also stand by the expression &quot;every German&quot;, and vote very soon, because if these words lead to weeks of negotiations, we never come to an end.&quot; In reply to that, deputy Titus Mareck of Graz quipped, &quot;Try and say &quot;every German&quot;, and you will see if the Slavs in Styria and Bohemia will be satisfied with it. I can assure you that this expression will be properly interpreted by the Czechs and Slavic leaders.&quot; Thus, the question proved too complicated to be answered after months of negotiations, much less weeks.

====Schleswig====
Though the Duchy of Schleswig&#x27;s situation was troublesome, its position within the new Germany was undisputed. The Confederate Diet welcomed the embattled duchy as its newest appendage on 12 April 1848. The &quot;Vorparlement&quot; similarly decreed the union of Schleswig with the German state, and sent invitations for Schleswig deputies to participate in the upcoming National Assembly.

====Bohemia and Moravia====
Bohemia and Moravia were already part of the Confederation, and without question were to remain within the new Germany, despite protests by the Czech population. Districts in the Czech majority areas boycotted elections to the National Assembly, and only a few Czech deputies took their seats in the Paulskirche. The Pan-Slav Congress begun in Prague on 2 June 1848 was cut short on 12 June by civil unrest, and the city was bombarded into submission by General Windisch-Grätz on 16 June. The National Assembly applauded the destruction of Slav secession, but some deputies saw in Windisch-Grätz&#x27;s violence a warning of what might befall them in the future.

====Posen and the &quot;Demarkationslinie&quot;====
Similar to Bohemia, the National Assembly was determined to incorporate much of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen against the wishes of the majority Polish population, especially after the failed Greater Poland uprising which lasted from 20 March until 9 May. Three separate debates and votes (the first on 26 April 1848 in the &quot;Vorparlement&quot;, the next on 27 July, the last on 6 February 1849) demarcated the borderline (&quot;Demarkationslinie Posen&quot;) between the German areas to have representation in the National Assembly and the Polish areas to be excluded. Each successive vote on the &quot;Demarkationslinie&quot; contracted the Polish area until only one-third of the province was excluded, while large a Polish population was to remain within the future German state.

====Limburg====
Debates about the integration of the Duchy of Limburg into the new Germany strained otherwise good relations with King William II of the Netherlands. King William was also Grand Duke of Luxemburg, which was a member of the German Confederation. After the Belgian revolution was finally settled in 1839, Luxemburg ceded 60 percent of its territory to Belgium. As compensation, the Dutch province of Limburg became a member of the Confederation, although only that portion whose population equaled what was lost to Belgium. Thus, the cities of Maastricht and Venlo were excluded. Membership meant very little, as the administration of Limburg remained entirely Dutch and the population was Dutch in national sentiment. Nevertheless, the National Assembly held several debates over the fate of Limburg, which not only irritated King William but also the British and the French. The Limburg question was never solved during the life of the National Assembly.

====Austrian Littoral and Trentino====
Despite their ethnic differences, the Italian-majority areas of the Austrian Littoral fully participated in the National Assembly. However, due to historical considerations, former Venetian possessions such as Monfalcone and half of Istria remained outside of the Confederation, and the question of their full integration into the new Germany was discussed. Most of the left-wing deputies had nationalist sentiments for the Italian revolutionaries in Milan and Venice and argued for a unified Italian state in the fashion of the new Germany being planned. However, there were few who approved of separating the littoral from the German Confederation, if only for strategic reasons.

In the Italian areas of Tyrol known as Trentino, the voting districts of Trient and Roveredo sent deputies to Frankfurt. In fact, the Roveredo municipal government petitioned the National Assembly to allow the Trentino to secede from the German Confederation. In response, the &quot;Landtag&quot; of Tyrol dispatched a letter of protest to the National Assembly for accepting the petition. The question of Istria&#x27;s full admission into the Confederation, and Trentino&#x27;s withdrawal, were referred to Committee but never voted upon in the Assembly itself.

====Auschwitz and Zator====
The two Austrian Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator joined the German Confederation in 1818 by virtue of their affiliation with Austrian Silesia, but the question of whether they should be part of the new Germany was only discussed briefly in the National Assembly. The population was entirely Polish and the territories an integral part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, itself outside of the Confederate boundaries. Deputy Carl Giskra of Mährisch-Trubau rhetorically asked how much longer the &quot;German lands of Zator and Auschowitz&quot; should remain part of Galicia, but another deputy derisively referred to the territories as &quot;fantasy duchies&quot; and denounced the question even being raised.

==== Greater German or smaller German solution ====
Regardless of these questions, the shape of the future German nation-state had only two real possibilities. The &quot;Smaller German Solution&quot; (&quot;Kleindeutsche Lösung&quot;) aimed for a Germany under the leadership of Prussia and excluded Imperial Austria so as to avoid becoming embroiled in the problems of that multi-cultural state. The supporters of the &quot;Greater German Solution&quot; (&quot;Großdeutsche Lösung&quot;), however, supported Austria&#x27;s incorporation. Some of those deputies expected the integration of all the Habsburg monarchy&#x27;s territories, while other Greater German supporters called for a variant only including areas settled by Germans within a German state.

The majority of the radical left voted for the Greater German variant, accepting the possibility formulated by Carl Vogt of a &quot;holy war for western culture against the barbarism of the East&quot;, i.e., against Poland and Hungary, whereas the liberal centre supported a more pragmatic stance. On 27 October 1848, the National Assembly voted for a Greater German Solution, but incorporating only &quot;Austria&#x27;s German lands&quot;.

====Austria&#x27;s protests====
The court camarilla surrounding the incapacitated Austrian Emperor Ferdinand was not, however, willing to break up the state. On 27 November 1848, only a few days before the coronation of Ferdinand&#x27;s designated successor, Franz Joseph I, Prime Minister Prince Felix zu Schwarzenberg declared the indivisibility of Austria. Thus, it became clear that, at most, the National Assembly could achieve national unity within the smaller German solution, with Prussia as the sole major power. Although Schwarzenberg demanded the incorporation of the whole of Austria into the new state once more in March 1849, the dice had fallen in favor of a Smaller German Empire by December 1848, when the irreconcilable differences between the position of Austria and that of the National Assembly had forced the Austrian, Schmerling, to resign from his role as &quot;Ministerpräsident&quot; of the provisional government. He was succeeded by Heinrich von Gagern.

Nonetheless, the Paulskirche Constitution was designed to allow a later accession of Austria, by referring to the territories of the German Confederation and formulating special arrangements for states with German and non-German areas. The allocation of votes in the &quot;Staatenhaus&quot; (§ 87 ) also allowed for a later Austrian entry.

== Drafting the Imperial Constitution ==

The National Assembly appointed a three-person committee of constitution on 24 May 1848, chaired by Bassermann and charged with preparing and coordinating the drafting of a &quot;Reichsverfassung&quot; (&quot;Imperial Constitution&quot;). It could make use of the preparatory work done by the Committee of Seventeen appointed earlier by the Confederate Diet.

Remarkably, the National Assembly did not begin its mandated work of drafting the Constitution until 19 October 1848. Up to that time, exactly five months after the opening of the National Assembly, the deputies had failed to move forward with its most important task. However, they were driven to urgency by the violent outbreak of the Vienna Uprising and its suppression by the Austrian Army.

=== Basic rights ===
On 28 December, the Assembly&#x27;s press organ, the &quot;Reichsgesetzblatt&quot; published the &quot;Reichsgesetz betreffend die Grundrechte des deutschen Volkes&quot; (&quot;Imperial law regarding the basic rights of the German people&quot;) of 27 December 1848, declaring the basic rights as immediately applicable.

The catalogue of basic rights included Freedom of Movement, Equal Treatment for all Germans in all of Germany, the abolishment of class-based privileges and medieval burdens, Freedom of Religion, Freedom of Conscience, the abolishment of capital punishment, Freedom of Research and Education, Freedom of Assembly, basic rights in regard to police activity and judicial proceedings, the inviolability of the home, Freedom of the Press, independence of judges, Freedom of Trade and Freedom of establishment.

=== Qualifying the Emperor ===

On 23 January 1849, a resolution that one of the reigning German princes should be elected as Emperor of Germany was adopted with 258 votes against 211. As the King of Prussia was implicitly the candidate, the vote saw conservative Austrian deputies joining the radical republican left in opposition.

=== The first and second readings ===

The first reading of the Constitution was completed on 3 February 1849. A list of amendments were proposed by 29 governments in common and on 15 February Gottfried Ludolf Camphausen, Prussia&#x27;s representative to the National Assembly, handed the draft to Prime Minister Gagern, who forwarded it to the Committee of the Parliament that was preparing the Constitution for its second reading. The amendments, designed to ensure the prerogatives of the princes in various state functions, were sidelined by arguments from the left for universal suffrage in elections and the secret ballot. Only two of Camphausen&#x27;s amendments were discussed and no modifications made. Furthermore, passage of the Austrian Constitution on 4 March 1849 was used as an excuse by Prince Schwarzenberg to declare the first draft of the federal Constitution incompatible with Austrian law, and would therefore have to be scrapped and replaced by a more accommodating document. The proclamation shocked the National Assembly, resulting in floral speeches condemning &quot;Austrian sabotage&quot;. But when on 21 March deputy Carl Theodor Welcker of Frankfurt brought up a motion to pass the Constitution &quot;as is&quot; to force the issue, it was rejected by 283 votes against 252. Nevertheless, shows of resistance to their Constitutional work by so many of the states shook the confidence of many deputies. There was suddenly a desperation in the National Assembly to complete their work.

The second reading commenced on 23 March 1849 after agreements had been reached with the Center and the Left over procedure: It was to be read without interruption to the very end; every paragraph was to be voted upon as reported by the committee on the Constitution; amendments were to be considered only at the request of at least 50 deputies. The reading proceeded with unusual pace, as the deputies feared they would become illegitimate in public opinion unless they overcame mounting obstacles and produced the Constitution. The Center conceded an amendment on the last day, in the form of an extension of the suspensive veto, to cover changes in the Constitution. They warned it could be used to overthrow the Imperial system, to which the Left applauded. Austria&#x27;s proposed amendment to turn the Imperial dignity into a Directory was soundly defeated, thus protecting the office of Emperor. The Left derided the center by shouting, &quot;A German Emperor chosen by a majority of four votes from four faithless Austrians!&quot; However, 91 Austrian deputies had cast votes for the Imperial system, thus rejecting Prince Schwarzenberg&#x27;s interference. An article to create an &quot;Imperial Council&quot; to advise the Emperor was stricken from the Constitution at the last moment.

=== Passage of the Constitution ===

The National Assembly passed the complete Imperial Constitution in the late afternoon of 27 March 1849. It was carried narrowly, by 267 against 263 votes. The version passed included the creation of a hereditary emperor (&quot;Erbkaisertum&quot;), which had been favoured mainly by the &quot;erbkaiserliche&quot; group around Gagern, with the reluctant support of the Westendhall group around Heinrich Simon.

The people were to be represented by a directly elected House of Commons (&quot;Volkshaus&quot;) and a House of the States (&quot;Staatenhaus&quot;) of representatives sent by the individual states. Half of each &quot;Staatenhaus&quot; delegation was to be appointed by the respective state government, the other by the state parliament.

== Head of state and &quot;Kaiserdeputation&quot; ==
As the near-inevitable result of having chosen the Smaller German Solution and the constitutional monarchy as form of government, the Prussian king was elected as hereditary head of state on 28 March 1849. The vote was carried by 290 votes against 248 abstentions, embodying resistance primarily by all left-wing, southern German and Austrian deputies. The deputies knew that Frederick William IV held strong prejudices against the work of the Frankfurt Parliament, but on 23 January, the Prussian government had informed the states of the German Confederation that Prussia would accept the idea of a hereditary emperor. 

Further, Prussia (unlike Bavaria, Württemberg, Saxony, and Hannover) had indicated its support of the draft constitution in a statement made after the first reading. Additionally, the representatives of the provisional government had attempted through innumerable meetings and talks to build an alliance with the Prussian government, especially by creating a common front against the radical left and by arguing that the monarchy could only survive if it accepted a constitutional-parliamentary system. The November 1848 discussion of Bassermann and Hergenhahn with the king also aimed in the same direction.

Shortly after the vote of 27 March 1849, Archduke John announced his resignation as Regent, explaining that the vote ended all reason for his office. President of the Assembly Eduard von Simson rushed to the Thurn and Taxis palace and pleaded for him to remain as Regent until the coronation could occur.

On 3 April 1849, the &quot;Kaiserdeputation&quot; (&quot;Emperor Deputation&quot;), a group of deputies chosen by the National Assembly and headed by Simson, offered Frederick William the office of Emperor. He gave an evasive answer, arguing that he could not accept the crown without the agreement of the princes and Free Cities. In reality, Frederick William believed in the principle of the Divine Right of Kings and thus did not want to accept a crown touched by &quot;the hussy smell of revolution&quot;. Then, on 5 April 1849, Prince Schwarzenberg recalled the Austrian deputies from the National Assembly and denounced the Constitution as being incompatible with Austrian sovereignty, with the caveat that Austria did not exclude itself from a German union, providing it was structured according to Austria&#x27;s needs. To ensure Austria&#x27;s role in German affairs did not diminish, Schwarzenberg convinced Archduke John to remain in office as Regent.

By 14 April 1849, 28 mostly petty states had accepted the constitution, and Württemberg was the only kingdom to do so after much hesitation. The kings of Hanover, Saxony, and Bavaria awaited Prussia&#x27;s formal response to the Constitution before decreeing their own. Then, on 21 April, King Frederick William IV formally rejected the Imperial Constitution and the crown that was to go with it.

This spelled the final failure of the National Assembly&#x27;s constitution and thus of the German revolution. The rejection of the crown was understood by the other princes as a signal that the political scales had fully tipped against the liberals. Opinion even in autumn 1848 had it that the National Assembly had taken far too long to draft the Constitution. Had they accomplished their task in the summer and offered the crown in autumn, the revolution might have taken a different turn.

== Rump parliament and dissolution ==
On 5 April 1849, all Austrian deputies left Frankfurt. The new elections called for by Prime Minister Heinrich Gagern did not take place, further weakening the assembly. In desperation, Gagern demanded that the Regent personally intervene with the Princes to save the Constitution. Reminding Gagern of his own terms forbidding the Provisional Central Power from interfering in the work of the Constitution, the Regent refused, and Gagern resigned in consequence on 10 May 1849.

On 14 May, the Prussian parliamentarians also resigned their mandates. In the following week, nearly all conservative and bourgeois-liberal deputies left the parliament. The remaining left-wing forces insisted that 28 states had accepted the Frankfurt Constitution and began the Constitutional Campaign (&quot;Reichsverfassungskampagne&quot;), an all-out call for resistance against the Princes who refused to accept the Constitution. The supporters of the campaign did not consider themselves revolutionaries. From their perspective, they represented a legitimate national executive power acting against states that had breached the Constitution. Nonetheless, only the radical democratic left was willing to use force to support the Constitution, notwithstanding their original reservations against it. In view of their failure, the bourgeoisie and the leading liberal politicians of the faction of the &quot;Halbe&quot; (&quot;half ones&quot;) rejected a renewed revolution and withdrew—most of them disappointed—from their hard work in the Frankfurt Parliament.

=== The May Uprisings ===
In the meantime, the &quot;Reichsverfassungskampagne&quot; had not achieved any success regarding acceptance of the Constitution, but had managed to mobilize those elements of the population that were willing to commit violent revolution. In Saxony, this led to the May Uprising in Dresden, in the Bavarian part of the Palatinate, the &quot;Pfälzer Aufstand&quot;, a rising during which revolutionaries gained the &quot;de facto&quot; governmental power. On 14 May, Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden had to flee the country after a mutiny of the Rastatt garrison. The insurrectionists declared a Baden Republic and formed a revolutionary government headed by the Paulskirche deputy Lorenz Brentano. Together with Baden soldiers that had joined their side, they formed an army under the leadership of the Polish general Mieroslawski.

=== Break with the Provisional Central Power ===
The Regent appointed the conservative Greater German advocate and National Assembly deputy Maximilian Grävell as his new Prime Minister on 16 May 1849. This so incensed the National Assembly that they held a vote of no confidence in the government on 17 May, resulting in a vote of 191 against 12 with 44 abstentions. Receiving moral support from Austria, the Regent stood defiant and retained his Prime Minister. Calls for the resignation of the Regent immediately followed.
The next day, 18 May, Prime Minister Grävell ascended the speaker&#x27;s podium in the &quot;Paulskirche&quot; and explained the Regent&#x27;s motives for appointing him as Prime Minister, and the Regent&#x27;s refusal to obey the National Assembly&#x27;s decisions. Grävell stated, &quot;You remember, gentlemen, that [the Regent] had declared to the deputation of the National Assembly which had been sent to him that he accepted the request made to him as a result of [all the German] governments&#x27; approval. You will recall that the Regent was introduced into his office in this place, but then the Confederate Diet ... gave him authority. The Regent, as a thoroughly conscientious man, will certainly never be able to lay down his office into any other hands than into those who have empowered him.&quot;

The uproar in the parliament was intense, yet Grävell persisted: &quot;If you have patience to wait, I will explain. The Regent can and will only return his office to the National Assembly from which it originated. But he will do so and cannot do otherwise, except as a staunch steward of the power entrusted to him by the governments, and only to return this power back into the hands of the governments.&quot;

Great unrest answered Grävell&#x27;s words, as the National Assembly was directly confronted with the statement that the Regent&#x27;s power originated from the states, &quot;not&quot; the revolution. With insults and jeers raining down from the gallery, the Prime Minister further stated, &quot;Gentlemen! Consider the consequences of the withdrawal of the Regent and the divorce of Germany from this war [with Denmark]. Remember that the honor of Germany is at stake!&quot; Grävell finally concluded, &quot;These, gentlemen, are the motives for why we came here, and why we cannot resign, in spite of your open distrust.&quot; The Prime Minister then departed. Deputy William Zimmermann of Stuttgart shouted from the gallery, &quot;This is unheard of in the history of the world!&quot;

After reading the rules of the Provisional Central Power, adopted 28 June and 4 September 1848, especially articles that address the removal of ministers and the Regent, President Theodore Reh of the National Assembly read the report from the Committee of Thirty that drafted a provisional regency (&quot;Reichsregentschaft&quot;) to defend the Constitution. The vote passed with a majority (126 to 116 votes) for the plan with a provisional governor (&quot;Reichstatthalter&quot;) to replace the Regent. However, external events overtook the National Assembly before they could attempt to carry out their plan.

=== Removal of the National Assembly to Stuttgart ===
As German Confederate troops under orders from the Regent began to crush revolutionary outbreak in the Palatinate, the remaining deputies in the Free City of Frankfurt began to feel threatened. Further deputies that were not willing to align with radical democratic left resigned their mandates or gave them up when asked to by their home governments. On 26 May, the Frankfurt National Assembly had to lower its quorum to a mere hundred due to the enduring low presence of deputies. The remaining deputies decided to escape an approaching army of occupation by moving the parliament to Stuttgart in Württemberg on 31 May. This had been suggested by the deputy Friedrich von Römer, who was also prime minister and minister of justice of the Württemberg government. Essentially, the Frankfurt National Assembly was dissolved at this point. From 6 June 1849 onwards, the remaining 154 deputies met in Stuttgart under the presidency of Friedrich Wilhelm Löwe. This convention was dismissively called the Rump Parliament (&quot;Rumpfparlament&quot;).

=== The Provisional Regency and People&#x27;s Army ===
Since the Provisional Central Power and the Regent refused to acknowledge the new situation, the Rump Parliament declared both as dismissed and proclaimed a new provisional regency (&quot;Reichsregentschaft&quot;) led by five deputies Franz Raveaux, Carl Vogt, Heinrich Simon, Friedrich Schüler and August Becher, and fashioned after the Directory of the French First Republic. Following its view of itself as the legitimate German parliament, the rump parliament called for tax resistance and military resistance against those states that did not accept the Paulskirche Constitution. On 16 June 1849, the rump parliament declared the formation of a People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Volkswehr&quot;) consisting of four classes from age 18 to 60. The Provisional Regency then called all Germans to arms in order to defend the Constitution of 1849.
Since these actions challenged the authority of Württemberg, and the Prussian army was successfully crushing the rebellions in the nearby Baden and the Palatinate, Römer and the Württemberg government distanced themselves from the rump parliament and prepared for its dissolution.

=== Dissolution ===
On 17 June, Römer informed the president of the parliament that &quot;the Württemberg government was no longer in a position to tolerate the meetings of the National Assembly that had moved to its territory, nor the activities of the regency elected on the 6th, anywhere in Stuttgart or Württemberg&quot;. At this point, the rump parliament had only 99 deputies and did not reach a quorum according to its own rules. On 18 June, the Württemberg army occupied the parliamentary chamber before the session started. The deputies reacted by organizing an impromptu protest march which was promptly quashed by the soldiers without bloodshed. Those deputies that were not from Württemberg were expelled.

Subsequent plans to move the parliament (or what was left of it) to Karlsruhe in Baden could not be implemented due to the looming defeat of the Baden revolutionaries, which was completed five weeks later.

==Aftermath==

After rejecting the Imperial Constitution on 21 April 1849, Prussia attempted to undermine the Provisional Central Power. King Frederick William IV intended to assume its functions after the Regent announced his resignation at the end of March. However, Prince Schwarzenberg had foiled Prussia&#x27;s efforts to do so. Therefore, Prussia chose to support the &quot;Unionspolitik&quot; (&quot;union policy&quot;) designed by the conservative Paulskirche deputy Joseph von Radowitz for a Smaller German Solution under Prussian leadership. This entailed modifying the Frankfurt Parliament&#x27;s conclusions, with a stronger role for the Prussian hereditary monarch and imposed &quot;from above&quot;. The National Assembly was notified of Prussia&#x27;s intentions on 28 April. The deputies refused to consider changes to their Constitution, and Prince Schwarzenberg similarly rejected Prussia&#x27;s proposals on 16 May. A draft dated 28 May 1849 created a league of the three kingdoms of Prussia, Hannover, and Saxony for one year in which to formulate an acceptable constitution for Germany.

The &quot;Erbkaiserliche&quot; around Gagern supported Prussia&#x27;s policy in the Gotha Post-Parliament and the Erfurt Union Parliament. This policy was based on Prussia&#x27;s insistence that both the National Assembly and the German Confederation were defunct. However, Austria&#x27;s policy was that the German Confederation had never ceased to exist. Rather, only the Confederate Diet had dissolved itself on 12 July 1848. Therefore, the Austrian Emperor could be restored as President of the German Confederation in succession to the Regent.

With this in mind, Archduke John attempted to resign his office once more in August 1849, stating that the Regency should be jointly held by Prussia and Austria through a committee of four until 1 May 1850, by which time all of the German governments should have decided on a new Constitution. The two governments agreed in principle, and a so-called &quot;Compact of Interim&quot; was signed on 30 September, transferring all responsibilities of the Provisional Central Power to the two states, though not relieving the Regent of his office just yet. By signing this compact, Prussia tacitly accepted Austria&#x27;s policy that the German Confederation still existed.

One week later, disagreements between the three kingdoms saw Prussia&#x27;s project for a new federal German government fall apart. On 5 October 1849, Hanover argued for an understanding with Austria before a new Parliament could be elected and a new Constitution drawn up, and Saxony seconded the motion. On 20 October, both kingdoms ended active participation in the league&#x27;s deliberations, isolating Prussia entirely. With Austria&#x27;s position in Germany more and more secure, Archduke John was finally permitted to resign his office of Regent on 20 December 1849.

Prussia spent the next year defying Austria&#x27;s protests. On 30 November 1850 the Punctuation of Olmütz forced Prussia to abandon its proposal to alter Germany&#x27;s political composition in its favor. By that time, all of the states in Germany had suppressed their Constitutions, popularly elected parliaments, and democratic clubs, thus erasing all work of the revolution. An exception was in Austria, where the hated &quot;corvée&quot; unpaid labor was not revived after it had been abolished in May 1848. On 30 May 1851, the old Confederate Diet was reopened in the Thurn and Taxis Palace.

== Long-term political effects ==
The March Revolution led to a major increase of Prussia&#x27;s political importance, though only gradually. By permitting the revolution to consolidate itself, and by supporting the Schleswig-Holstein rebellion with Prussian troops, the Hohenzollern dynasty was reviled in Scandinavia and especially Russia. Prussia&#x27;s role as a Great Power in Europe did not recover until the Crimean War saw Russia isolated, Austria maligned for its wavering policy, and Britain and France embarrassed by their poor military performance.

Yet Prussia, by its leading role in suppressing the revolution, had demonstrated its indispensability as a main player in German politics and its superiority over small and medium states. It was now in a far better strategic position among the lesser and petty princes. Revolutionary outbreaks in Swabia had terrified the two princes of Hohenzollern, and they sold their possessions to their Prussian cousin on 7 December 1849, thus giving the great northern power a foothold in the south. Prussia had also won the gratitude of the family of the Grand Duchy of Baden as an important ally in southern Germany, and the Smaller German Solution gained in popularity throughout the nation. This political pass contributed to the adoption of the Smaller German Solution after the Prussian victory in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, which led to the foundation of the North German Confederation. The Smaller German Solution was implemented after the 1870/71 Franco-Prussian War in the form of Prussian-dominated unification &quot;from above&quot;, namely the 1871 proclamation of the German Empire.

Historians have suggested several possible explanations for the German &quot;Sonderweg&quot; of the 20th century: discreditation of democrats and liberals, their estrangement, and the unfulfilled desire for a nation-state, which had led to separation of the national question from the assertion of civic rights.

The work of the National Assembly and more generally of the March revolution was judged harshly in the immediate aftermath. Authors such as Ludwig Häusser classed the ideas of the radical democratic left as irresponsible and naive foolishness. The bourgeois liberals were also discredited; many of them left politics disappointed and under great hostility from their fellow citizens in the individual states. It is probably partially due to this that Bassermann committed suicide in 1855. A positive reception of the National Assembly&#x27;s work only came about in the Weimar Republic and more so after World War II, when both the East German Democratic Republic and the Western Federal Republic of Germany competed for the use of the democratic Paulskirche heritage as specific traditions of the separate states.

<text>The State Flag of the Kyrgyz Republic consists of a red field charged with a yellow sun that contains a depiction of a &quot;tunduk&quot;, the opening in the center of the roof of a &quot;yurt&quot; (traditional nomadic tent). Adopted in 1992, just over seven months after the country&#x27;s independence was declared, to replace the flag of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, it has been the flag of Kyrgyzstan since that year. The red on the flag is said to be inspired by the pennant lifted by Manas, the country&#x27;s folk hero.

==History==

Kyrgyz rebels wielded white banners (named &quot;White Banner of National Liberation&quot;) during the Andijan uprising of 1898. Later, during the Central Asian revolt of 1916, they used it again during an uprising in Jizzakh and during an attack on Prebechakenska.

Under Soviet rule, the Union Republic — coterminous with modern-day Kyrgyzstan — utilized a flag derived from the flag of the Soviet Union and representing Communism, that was adopted in 1953. It declared itself independent on 31 August 1991, approximately four months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the Soviet-era flag maintained its status as the national flag for seven months after independence was declared. It was finally replaced by new design on 3 March 1992, one day after Kyrgyzstan was admitted to the United Nations along with seven other post-Soviet states.

In late 2023, a debate was led in the Zhogorku Kengesh (parliament of Kyrgyzstan) to straighten the wavy sun rays due to its supposed similarity to a sunflower, which in Kyrgyz culture can signify &quot;a fickle and servile person willing to switch allegiance for personal benefit&quot;. The bill passed its first reading on 29 November, and second and third readings on 20 December. The bill was signed into law by President Sadyr Japarov on 22 December. The law was officially published on 26 December and came into force on the same day.
== Chronology ==
==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colors and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The red field stands for &quot;bravery and valor&quot;, and alludes to the purported emblem hoisted by Manas, the national hero of Kyrgyzstan. The sun epitomizes peace and prosperity, while its 40 rays stand for the number of tribes united by Manas to fight against the Mongols, as well as the number of followers he had.

The centre of the sun features a stylized illustration of the roof (&quot;tunduk&quot;) atop a traditional Kyrgyz tent (&quot;yurt&quot;) when viewed from the interior. Although these tents are less commonly used today, its incorporation into the flag is meant to symbolize the &quot;origin of life&quot;, the &quot;unity of time and space&quot;, as well as the people&#x27;s &quot;hearth and home&quot; and their history.

===Proposals for change===
In late 2023, a debate was led in the Zhogorku Kengesh (parliament of Kyrgyzstan) to straighten the wavy sun rays due to its supposed similarity to a sunflower, which in Kyrgyz culture can signify &quot;a fickle and servile person willing to switch allegiance for personal benefit&quot;. The bill passed its first reading on 29 November, and second and third readings on 20 December. The bill was signed into law by President Sadyr Japarov on 22 December. The law was officially published on 26 December and came into force on the same day.

The red field has also been the source of much criticism. Some believe that it evokes the nation&#x27;s tempestuous history, while others are of the opinion that it is a lingering remnant of communism in the country.

===Color scheme===

==Regional flags==
Each region (&quot;областы&quot;, &quot;oblasty&quot; or &quot;облусу&quot;, &quot;oblusu&quot;) of Kyrgyzstan has its own flag.

<doc id="312722" wikidata="Q762048" url="?curid=312722" title="Concert band">
<text>A concert band, also called a wind band, wind ensemble, wind symphony, wind orchestra, symphonic band, the symphonic winds, or symphonic wind ensemble, is a performing ensemble consisting of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families of instruments, and occasionally including the harp, double bass, or bass guitar. On rare occasions, additional, non-traditional instruments may be added to such ensembles such as piano, synthesizer, or electric guitar.

Concert band music generally includes original wind compositions, concert marches, transcriptions of orchestral arrangements, light music, and popular music. Though the concert band does have similar instrumentation to the marching band, a marching band&#x27;s main purpose is to perform while marching. In contrast, a concert band usually performs as a stationary ensemble, though European ensembles often do both.

==Origins==
The origins of concert band can be traced back to the French Revolution, in which large bands would often gather for patriotic festivals and celebrations. These bands would play popular music that would immediately captivate the public&#x27;s attention. Throughout the French Revolution, however, serious composers were often not interested in composing music for bands; this was due in large part to the instrumentation. Concert bands were (and still are) not standardized in their required type and number of instruments, making it nearly impossible to write the correct number of parts for the correct types of instruments. The quality of instruments also impacted composers&#x27; unwillingness to compose music for concert band. Wind instruments at that time were often difficult to play in tune and had difficulty in switching pitch and rhythm fast enough. This in turn influenced bands to stick with pieces that were transposed from orchestral movements and arrangements, something that has carried into modern day.

During the 19th century, large ensembles of wind and percussion instruments in the British and American traditions existed mainly in the form of the military band for ceremonial and festive occasions, and the works performed consisted mostly of marches. The only time wind bands were used in a concert setting comparable to that of a symphony orchestra was when transcriptions of orchestral or operatic pieces were arranged and performed, as there were comparatively few original concert works for a large wind ensemble.

It wasn&#x27;t until the early 20th century that composers began writing works for concert band. Concert band composers of this time were frustrated at the lack of quality music for bands, and as such, began writing and performing pieces to remedy this. One of the first and most important original works for concert band, First Suite for Band by Gustav Holst, was written in 1909. Other composers of this time period include Ralph Vaughan Williams, Richard Wagner, and Aaron Copland.

=== Instrumentation ===
Before the 1950s, wind ensembles included various combinations of instruments. The modern &quot;standard&quot; instrumentation of the wind ensemble was more or less established by Frederick Fennell at Eastman School of Music as the Eastman Wind Ensemble in 1952 after the model of the orchestra: a pool of players from which a composer can select in order to create different sonorities. According to Fennell, the wind ensemble was not revolutionary, but developed naturally out of the music.

==Bands today==
===Military bands===
A military band is a group of personnel that performs musical duties for military functions, usually for the armed forces. A typical military band consists mostly of wind and percussion instruments. The conductor of a band commonly bears the title of Bandmaster or Director of Music. Ottoman military bands are thought to be the oldest variety of military marching band in the world, dating from the 13th century.

Military bands were originally used to control troops on the battlefield, by using instruments such as drums, bugles, and fifes among others. As communication systems during war became more advanced, the use of instruments on the battlefield as signaling devices fell out of use. From then on, military bands would fulfill a ceremonial role, entertaining troops and playing for the community. As its role shifted so too did its instrumentation. A wider range of instruments was employed to play transcriptions of orchestral works, the bulk of the early wind band repertoire. These military bands evolved into the modern drum and bugle corps and helped to spread the idea of a concert band. A modern military will often have multiple types of bands (e.g. the United States Marine Corps has both a drum and bugle corps and wind ensemble).

===Professional bands===
Professional concert bands not associated with the military appear across the globe, particularly in developed countries. However, most do not offer full-time positions. The competition to make it into one of these concert bands is incredibly high and the ratio of performers to entrants is narrowly small. Examples of professional non-military concert bands include:
* Dallas Wind Symphony, led by Jerry Junkin
* Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra, led for many years by Frederick Fennell, and currently conducted by Takeshi Ooi
* Osaka Shion Wind Orchestra 
* Royal Hawaiian Band, created by royal decree in 1836 by King Kamehameha III

===Community bands===
A community band is a concert band or brass band ensemble composed of volunteer (non-paid) amateur musicians in a particular geographic area. It may be sponsored by the local (municipal) government or self-supporting. These groups rehearse regularly and perform at least once a year. Some bands are also marching bands, participating in parades and other outdoor events. Although they are volunteer musical organizations, community bands may employ an artistic director (conductor) or various operational staff.

The rise of the community band can partially be attributed to industrialization. As the instruments became easier to manufacture, their availability greatly increased. This meant that many amateurs could now form a town band, their arrangements typically consisting of patriotic tunes, marches, and popular music. The American Civil War marked a turning point in the American community band where many military musicians, either stemming from amateur or professional backgrounds, sought to create their own community band after the war&#x27;s conclusion. The large number of bands created during this era led to a &quot;Golden Age of Bands&quot;, spearheaded by conductors such as John Philip Sousa and Patrick Gilmore. The new forms of twentieth-century entertainment, namely the radio and phonograph, led to decline in community bands. This led to instrument manufacturers, who previously had marketed to the community bands, to focus on schools. The expansion of school music programs would eventually help restore interest in the community band as graduates sought to play in a band together again.

===School bands===
A school band is a group of student musicians who rehearse and perform instrumental music together. A school band is usually under the direction of one or more conductors (band directors). A school band consists of woodwind instruments, brass instruments and percussion instruments, although upper level bands may also have string basses or bass guitar.

In many traditional U.S. high schools, there are multiple band levels, distinguished by skill level or other factors. In such schools, an audition may be required to advance to further band levels, while the common level would be open to anyone. For example, in many U.S. high schools, &quot;Concert Band&quot; refers to the introductory level band, &quot;Symphonic Band&quot; is the title for the intermediate level band, and &quot;Wind Ensemble&quot; is the title for the advanced level band.

==Instrumentation==

Instrumentation for the wind band is not completely standardized; composers will frequently add or omit parts. Instruments and parts in parentheses in the list below are less common but still often used; due to the fact that some bands are missing these instruments, important lines for these instruments are often cued into other parts.

Instrumentation differs depending on the type of ensemble. Middle school and high school bands frequently have more limited instrumentation and fewer parts (for example, no double reeds, or only two horn parts instead of four). This is both to limit the difficulty for inexperienced players and because schools frequently do not have access to the less common instruments.

The standard concert band will have several players on each part depending on available personnel and the preference of the conductor. A concert band can theoretically have as many as 200 members from a set of only 35 parts. The wind ensemble, on the other hand, will have very little doubling, if any; commonly, clarinets or flutes may be doubled, especially to handle any &quot;divisi&quot; passages, and others will have one player per part, as dictated by the requirements of a specific composition. It is also common to see two tubas and two euphoniums or baritones playing the same part in a wind ensemble.

While largely made up of wind and percussion instruments, string instruments such as the string bass and concert harp are often scored for. The use of a harp dates back to its inclusion in the professional and military bands of John Philip Sousa and Edwin Franko Goldman. Such bands would often contain the top harpists of the country, such as Winifred Bambrick, who was one of the first female instrumentalists to tour with the Sousa Band, and Victor Salvi, who played with the United States Navy Band. Notably, the United States Air Force Band scores for cellos, a practice unique to the ensemble that dates back to the tenure of director George S. Howard.

Complicated percussion parts are common in concert band pieces, often requiring many percussionists. Many believe this is a major difference between the orchestra (which usually lacks a large battery of percussion) and the concert band. While in older transcriptions and concert works, the timpani were treated as their own section as in an orchestra, today in bands the timpani are considered &quot;a part of&quot; the percussion section. Consequently, the timpani player often will double on other percussion instruments.

Contemporary compositions often call on players to use unusual instruments or effects. For example, several pieces call on the use of a siren while others will ask players to play recorders, whirly tubes, or to sing, hum, snap, clap or even crinkle sheets of paper. The wind band&#x27;s diverse instrumentation and large number of players makes it a very flexible ensemble, capable of producing a variety of sonic effects.

Instrumentation has developed throughout time to become more efficient for the conditions that marching bands need to play in. For example, clarinets were found to be more suitable than the older oboes and became more widely used in the 18th century. More heavy and bulky instruments were replaced by trombones and cornets. In the 19th century, band instruments became highly developed as they started to add keys and valves that made certain ranges and notes on instruments easier to navigate and perform, which became a huge game changer for all musicians.

==Repertoire==

===Development of a repertoire===

Until early in the 20th century, there was little music written specifically for the wind band, which led to an extensive repertoire of pieces transcribed from orchestral works, or arranged from other sources. However, as the wind band moved out of the sole domain of the military marching ensemble and into the concert hall, it has gained favor with composers, and now many works are being written specifically for the concert band and the wind ensemble. While today there are composers who write exclusively for band, many composers famous for their work in other genres have given their talents to composition for wind bands as well. This is especially true in Japan, where an enormous market can be found for wind band compositions, which is largely due to commissions by the All-Japan Band Association and leading professional ensembles such as the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra and Osaka Municipal Symphonic Band, as well as the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma Commissioning Program, the longest-running commissioning series for wind band in the United States.

===Important concert band literature===
==Wind-band research==
Research on wind-band topics began in earnest in 1964 through the &quot;Journal of Band Research&quot;, affiliated with the American Bandmasters Association.

During the early 21st century, organizations that promote band research began publishing more research on wind band-related topics: Germany-based IGEB (founded 1974), the World Association of Symphonic Bands and Ensembles (WASBE, founded 1983), and US-based organizations Historic Brass Society (founded 1988), National Band Association (NBA, founded 1960), and College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA, founded 1941).

Internationally notable wind-band researchers include Vincent Dubois on French bands, Paul Niemisto on Finnish bands, Frederick Harris on wind-band conductors, Jill M. Sullivan on US women&#x27;s bands, Frank Battisti on US bands, David Hebert on Japanese and Polynesian bands, Patrick M. Jones on US military bands, and David Whitwell on European bands and repertoire.

==Band associations==
Some notable band associations include:
* American Bandmasters Association
* British Association of Symphonic Bands and Wind Ensembles

<doc id="312726" wikidata="Q1367629" url="?curid=312726" title="Roman festivals">
<text>Festivals in ancient Rome were a very important part in Roman religious life during both the Republican and Imperial eras, and one of the primary feat of &quot;holy days&quot;; singular also &quot;feriae&quot; or dies ferialis) were either public &quot;(publicae)&quot; or private &quot;(privatae)&quot;. State holidays were celebrated by the Roman people and received public funding. Games &quot;(ludi)&quot;, such as the Ludi Apollinares, were not technically &quot;feriae&quot;, but the days on which they were celebrated were &quot;dies festi&quot;, holidays in the modern sense of days off work. Although &quot;feriae&quot; were paid for by the state, &quot;ludi&quot; were often funded by wealthy individuals. &quot;Feriae privatae&quot; were holidays celebrated in honor of private individuals or by families. This article deals only with public holidays, including rites celebrated by the state priests of Rome at temples, as well as celebrations by neighborhoods, families, and friends held simultaneously throughout Rome.

&quot;Feriae publicae&quot; were of three kinds:
* &quot;Stativae&quot; were annual holidays that held a fixed or stable date on the calendar.
* &quot;Conceptivae&quot; were annual holidays that were moveable feasts (like Easter on the Christian calendar, or Thanksgiving in North America); the date was announced by the magistrates or priests who were responsible for them.
* &quot;Imperativae&quot; were holidays held &quot;on demand&quot; (from the verb &quot;impero, imperare&quot;, &quot;to order, command&quot;) when special celebrations or expiations were called for.

One of the most important sources for Roman holidays is Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;, an incomplete poem that describes and provides origins for festivals from January to June at the time of Augustus.

==Keeping the &quot;feriae&quot;==

Varro defined &quot;feriae&quot; as &quot;days instituted for the sake of the gods.&quot; Religious rites were performed on the &quot;feriae&quot;, and public business was suspended. Even slaves were supposed to be given some form of rest. Cicero says specifically that people who were free should not engage in lawsuits and quarrels, and slaves should get a break from their labours. Agricultural writers recognized that some jobs on a farm might still need to be performed, and specified what these were. Some agricultural tasks not otherwise permitted could be carried out if an expiation were made in advance &quot;(piaculum)&quot;, usually the sacrifice of a puppy. Within the city of Rome, the flamens and the priest known as the &quot;Rex sacrorum&quot; were not allowed even to see work done.

On a practical level, those who &quot;inadvertently&quot; worked could pay a fine or offer up a &quot;piaculum&quot;, usually a pig. Work considered vital either to the gods or preserving human life was excusable, according to some experts on religious law. Although Romans were required not to work, they were not required to take any religious action unless they were priests or had family rites &quot;(sacra gentilicia)&quot; to maintain.

==List of festivals by month==
Following is a month-by-month list of Roman festivals and games that had a fixed place on the calendar. For some, the date on which they were first established is recorded. A deity&#x27;s festival often marked the anniversary (&quot;dies natalis,&quot; &quot;birthday&quot;) of the founding of a temple, or a rededication after a major renovation. Festivals not named for deities are thought to be among the oldest on the calendar.

Some religious observances were monthly. The first day of the month was the Kalends (or Calends, from which the English word &quot;calendar&quot; derives). Each Kalends was sacred to Juno, and the &quot;Regina sacrorum&quot; (&quot;Queen of the Rites,&quot; a public priestess) marked the day by presiding over a sacrifice to the goddess. Originally a pontiff and the &quot;Rex sacrorum&quot; reported the sighting of the new moon, and the pontiff announced whether the Nones occurred on the 5th or 7th of that month. On the Nones, announcements were made regarding events to take place that month; with the exception of the Poplifugia, no major festivals were held before the Nones, though other ceremonies, such as anniversaries of temple dedications, might be carried out. The Ides (usually the 13th, or in a few months the 15th) were sacred to Jupiter. On each Ides, a white lamb was led along the Via Sacra to the Capitolium for sacrifice to Jupiter.

The list also includes other notable public religious events such as sacrifices and processions that were observed annually but are neither &quot;feriae&quot; nor &quot;dies natales.&quot; Unless otherwise noted, the calendar is that of H.H. Scullard, &quot;Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic&quot;.

===Ianuarius===
*1 (Calends): From 153 BC onward, consuls entered office on this date, accompanied by &quot;vota publica&quot; (public vows for the wellbeing of the republic and later of the emperor) and the taking of auspices. Festivals were also held for the imported cult of Aesculapius and for the obscure god Vediovis.
* 3-5: most common dates for Compitalia, a movable feast &quot;(feriae conceptivae)&quot;
* 5 (Nones): &quot;Dies natalis&quot; (founding day) of the shrine of Vica Pota on the Velian Hill
*9: Agonalia in honor of Janus, after whom the month January is named; first of at least four festivals named Agonalia throughout the year
*11 and 15: Carmentalia, with Juturna celebrated also on the 11th
* 13 (Ides)
* 24–26: most common dates for the Sementivae, a &quot;feriae conceptivae&quot; of sowing, perhaps also known as the Paganalia as celebrated by the &quot;pagi&quot;
* 27: &quot;Dies natalis&quot; of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, or perhaps marking its rededication (see also July 15); &quot;Ludi Castores&quot; (&quot;Games of the Castors&quot;) celebrated at Ostia during the Imperial period

===Februarius===
In the archaic Roman calendar, February was the last month of the year. The name derives from &quot;februa&quot;, &quot;the means of purification, expiatory offerings.&quot; It marked a turn of season, with February 5 the official first day of spring bringing the renewal of agricultural activities after winter.
* 1 (Kalends): &quot;Dies natalis&quot; for the Temple of Juno Sospita, Mother and Queen; &quot;sacra&quot; at the Grove of Alernus, near the Tiber at the foot of the Palatine Hill

* 13 (Ides): minor festival of Faunus on the Tiber Island
* 13–22: Parentalia, a commemoration of ancestors and the dead among families
** 13: Parentatio, with appeasement of the Manes beginning at the 6th hour and ceremonies performed by the chief Vestal; temples were closed, no fires burned on altars, marriages were forbidden, magistrates took off their insignia, until the 21st
* 15: Lupercalia
* 17: last day of the &quot;feriae conceptivae&quot; Fornacalia, the Oven Festival; Quirinalia, in honour of Quirinus
*21: Feralia, the only public observation of the Parentalia, marked F &quot;(dies festus)&quot; in some calendars and FP (a designation of uncertain meaning) in others, with dark rites aimed at the gods below &quot;(di inferi)&quot;
* 22: Caristia (or Cara Cognatio, &quot;Dear Kindred&quot;), a potluck meal provided by all the family, and shared in a spirit of love and forgiveness
* 23: Terminalia, in honour of Terminus
* 24: Regifugium
*27: Equirria, first of two horse-racing festivals to Mars

===Martius===
In the old Roman calendar (until perhaps as late as 153 BC), the &quot;mensis Martius&quot; (&quot;Mars&#x27; Month&quot;) was the first month of the year. It is one of the few months to be named for a god, Mars, whose festivals dominate the month.
*1 (Kalends): the original New Year&#x27;s Day when the sacred fire of Rome was renewed; the dancing armed priesthood of the Salii celebrated the &quot;Feriae Marti&quot; (holiday for Mars), which was also the &quot;dies natalis&quot; (&quot;birthday&quot;) of Mars; also the Matronalia, in honor of Juno Lucina, Mars&#x27; mother 
* 7: a second festival for Vediovis 
* 9: a &quot;dies religiosus&quot; when the Salii carried the sacred shields &quot;(ancilia)&quot; around the city again
*14: the second Equirria, a &quot;Feriae Marti&quot; also called the Mamuralia or &quot;sacrum Mamurio&quot;
* 15 (Ides): &quot;Feriae Iovi&quot;, sacred to Jove, and also the feast of the year goddess Anna Perenna
* 16–17: the procession of the Argei
* 17: Liberalia, in honour of Liber; also an Agonalia for Mars
* 19: Quinquatrus, later expanded into a five-day holiday as Quinquatria, a &quot;Feriae Marti&quot;, but also a feast day for Minerva, possibly because her temple on the Aventine Hill was dedicated on this day
* 23: Tubilustrium, purification of the trumpets.
* 24: a day marked QRCF, when the Comitia Calata met to sanction wills
* 25: Hilaria, A two-weeks long festival commemorating Cybele&#x27;s lamentation (fasting, castigation, taurobolium, festoonment, washing) of the death and rejoicing of at the resurrection of her mortal lover Attis.
*31: anniversary of the Temple of Luna on the Aventine

===Aprilis===

A major &quot;feriae conceptivae&quot; in April was the Latin Festival.

*21: Dies Romana, a festival linked to the foundation of Rome. According to legend, Romulus is said to have founded the city of Rome on April 21, 753 BC. From this date, the Roman chronology derived its system, known by the Latin phrase &quot;Ab Urbe condita&quot;, meaning &quot;from the founding of the City&quot;, which counted the years from this presumed foundation.
*23: the first of two wine festivals (Vinalia), the &quot;Vinalia Priora&quot; for the previous year&#x27;s wine, held originally for Jupiter and later Venus
*25: Robigalia, an agricultural festival involving dog sacrifice
*27 (28 in the Julian calendar) to May 1: Ludi Florales in honour of Flora, extended to May 3 under the Empire

===Maius===
The &quot;feriae conceptivae&quot; of this month was the Ambarvalia.
*1 (Kalends): Games of Flora continue; sacrifice to Maia; anniversary of the Temple of Bona Dea on the Aventine; rites for the Lares Praestites, tutelaries of the city of Rome
* 3: in the Imperial period, a last celebration for Flora, or the anniversary of one of her temples
*9, 11, 13: Lemuria, a festival of the dead with both public and household rites, possibly with a sacrifice to Mania on the 11th

*15 (Ides): Mercuralia, in honor of Mercury; &quot;Feriae&quot; of Jove
*21: one of four Agonalia, probably a third festival for Vediovis 
*23: a second Tubilustrium; &quot;Feriae&quot; for Volcanus (Vulcan)
* 24: QRCF, following Tubilustrium as in March
* 25: anniversary of the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia

Scullard places the Taurian Games on June 25–26, but other scholars doubt these &quot;ludi&quot; had a fixed date or recurred on a regular basis.
* 1 (Kalends): anniversaries of the Temple of Juno Moneta; of the Temple of Mars on the &quot;clivus&quot; (slope, street) outside the Porta Capena; and possibly of the Temple of the Tempestates (storm goddesses); also a festival of the complex goddess Cardea or Carna

==&quot;Feriae conceptivae&quot;==
The following &quot;moveable feasts&quot; are listed roughly in chronological order.
* Compitalia, held sometime between December 17 (the Saturnalia) and January 5; in the later Empire, they were regularly held January 3–5, but Macrobius (5th century AD) still categorized them as &quot;conceptivae&quot;.
* Sementivae, a festival of sowing honoring Tellus and Ceres, placed on January 24–26 by Ovid, who regards these &quot;feriae&quot; as the same as Paganalia; Varro may indicate that the two were separate festivals.
* Fornacalia, a mid-February baking festival celebrated by the &quot;curiae&quot;, the 30 archaic divisions of the Roman people; the date was announced by the &quot;curio maximus&quot; and set for each &quot;curia&quot; individually, with a general Fornacalia on February 17 for those who had missed their own or who were uncertain to which &quot;curia&quot; they belonged.
* Amburbium, a ceremony to purify the city &quot;(urbs)&quot; as a whole, perhaps held sometime in February.
* Feriae Latinae (Latin Festival), a major and very old &quot;conceptivae&quot; in April.
* Ambarvalia, purification of the fields in May.
The Rosalia or &quot;Festival of Roses&quot; also had no fixed date, but was technically not one of the &quot;feriae conceptivae&quot; with a date announced by public priests based on archaic practice.

==&quot;Feriae imperativae&quot;==
Festivals were also held in ancient Rome in response to particular events, or for a particular purpose such as to propitiate or show gratitude toward the gods. For example, Livy reports that following the Roman destruction of Alba Longa in the 7th century BC, and the removal of the Alban populace to Rome, it was reported to have rained stones on the Mons Albanus. A Roman deputation was sent to investigate the report, and a further shower of stones was witnessed. The Romans took this to be a sign of the displeasure of the Alban gods, the worship of whom had been abandoned with the evacuation of Alba Longa. Livy goes on to say that the Romans instituted a public festival of nine days, at the instigation either of a &#x27;heavenly voice&#x27; heard on the Mons Albanus, or of the haruspices. Livy also says that it became the longstanding practice in Rome that whenever a shower of stones was reported, a festival of nine days would be ordered in response.

Another irregular festival of note is the Secular Games. Over the course of several days there were sacrifices, entertainers, and games hosted by the state, attempting to be the greatest display anyone living had ever seen. These games were intended to be held every 100 years with the purpose of it occurring only once in any individuals lifetime. At one point two cycles of the Secular Games were being held simultaneously, leading there to be people who would in fact witness it twice in their life.

==&quot;Mercatus&quot;==
The noun (plural ) means &quot;commerce&quot; or &quot;the market&quot; generally, but it also refers to fairs or markets held immediately after certain . Cicero said that Numa Pompilius, the semi-legendary second king of Rome, established in conjunction with religious festivals to facilitate trade, since people had already gathered in great numbers. In early times, these may have played a role in wholesale trade, but as commerce in Rome became more sophisticated, by the late Republic they seem to have become retail fairs specialized for the holiday market. The Sigillaria attached to the Saturnalia may have been a in this sense. Surviving record , July 14–19; , September 20–23; and , November 18–20. Others may have existed. The English word &quot;fair&quot; derives from Latin .

==&quot;Roman holidays&quot; as trope==
By the outset of the nineteenth century and particularly in response to the carnage of the latter years of the French revolution, the term &quot;Roman holiday&quot; had taken on sinister aspects, implying an event that occasions enjoyment or profit at the expense, or derived from the suffering, of others, as in this passage about a dying gladiator from Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;:

&quot;There&quot; were his young barbarians all at play,&quot;There&quot; was their Dacian mother—he their sire,Butchered to make a Roman holiday.&quot;

More benignly, the phrase was used as the title of a romantic movie set in Rome, &quot;Roman Holiday.&quot;

<text>Barry Hughart (March 13, 1934 – August 1, 2019) was an American author of fantasy novels.

== Background ==
Hughart was born in Peoria, Illinois on March 13, 1934. His father, John Harding Page, served as a naval officer. His mother, Veronica Hughart, was an architect.

Hughart was educated at Phillips Academy (Andover). After graduating from high school, he had undiagnosed depression, which was classified at the time as schizophrenia, and was treated in the Kings County Psychiatric Ward. Following his release he attended Columbia University, where he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1956.

Upon his graduation from Columbia, Hughart joined the United States Air Force and served from 1956 to 1960 where he was involved in laying mines in the Korean Demilitarized Zone.
During Hughart&#x27;s military service he began to develop his lifelong interest in China that led him to plan a series set in &quot;an Ancient China that never was&quot;. His connection to China continued after his military service, as he worked with TechTop, a military surplus company that was based in Asia, from 1960 to 1965.

From 1965 to 1970 Hughart was the manager of the Lenox Hill Book Shop in New York City.

== Writing ==

Barry Hughart&#x27;s writing career started with his novel &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, published in 1984, which won the 1985 World Fantasy Award for best novel and also won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award in 1986, followed by &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen&quot; in 1990. He intended to write seven novels about the adventures of Li Kao and Number Ten Ox, but his writing career was cut short due to issues with his publishers. After his last published novel, Hughart reportedly stopped writing. Hughart cites Alexandre Dumas, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Mark Twain as major influences in his work. &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; are two major works he also states as affecting his own writing.

===&quot;The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox&quot;===
&quot;The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox&quot; is a series of three books about Li Kao, an ancient sage and scholar with &quot;a slight flaw in his character&quot;, and his client, later assistant, the immensely strong peasant Number Ten Ox, who narrates the story. The series blends Chinese mythology—authentic and imagined, from several eras—with detective fiction and a gentle, ironic humour. The first book &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; was published in 1984, the title derived from &quot;The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl&quot; myth. It was followed in 1988 by &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot; and in 1990 by &quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen&quot;. No further books followed, although Hughart had planned a series of seven novels. In the last of these, Li Kao and Number Ten Ox would die facing the Great White Serpent (a conflict alluded to in &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;). They would then become minor celestial deities who would continue to cause problems for the August Personage of Jade. An omnibus edition, &quot;The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox&quot; was first published in 1998 by The Stars Our Destination Books in both hardback and trade paperback. It was illustrated by Kaja Foglio.

====&quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; (1984)====

The first novel in the series, &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;, received the 1986 Mythopoeic Award for Best Fantasy Novel and tied for the 1985 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. It has been translated into at least six different languages: Bulgarian; French; German; Hebrew; Japanese; and Spanish. Hughart considered the first draft of the book as completely &quot;wrong&quot; and set it aside for many years. His inspiration for finishing the book came about after reading &quot;The Importance of Understanding&quot; by Lin Yutang. Hughart stated that he realized his first version was about &quot;monsters and marvels and mayhem&quot; and that &quot;the book hadn&#x27;t really been about anything&quot;. When he decided to continue working on the book he made &quot;love&quot; the central theme of the story.

====&quot;The Story of the Stone&quot; (1988)====

The second book of the series. Master Li and Number Ten Ox set out on another adventure after the killing of a monk, to find out his murderer and to find a stolen manuscript from his library. &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot; takes place in the Valley of the Sorrows where they set out to find the Laughing Prince, the murder suspect.

====&quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen&quot; (1990)====
The third book of the series, &quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen&quot;, is the final adventure of Master Li and Number Ten Ox.

===Publication issues===
In an interview in 2000 Hughart blamed the end of the &quot;Master Li and Number Ten Ox&quot; series on unsympathetic and incompetent publishers. The style of his books made them difficult to classify and he felt his market was restricted by the decision to sell only to SF/fantasy outlets. As an example of publisher incompetence, Hughart notes that his publishers did not notify him of the awards given &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;. He also points out that &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot; was published three months ahead of schedule, so that no purchasable copies were available by the time the scheduled reviews finally appeared; finally, the paperback edition of &quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen&quot; was published simultaneously with the hardback edition resulting in few sales of the latter. When his publishers then refused to publish hardback editions of any future books, Hughart stated that he found it impossible to afford to continue writing novels, which brought the series to an end. Later in 2008, Hughart wrote

===Style===

Barry Hughart&#x27;s style has been considered difficult to classify. Hughart uses a &quot;faux-oriental style&quot; with &quot;long alliterations, poetic hyperboles, and casual references to Chinese culture&quot; and lighthearted humor.

===Themes===
Reviewers identify many themes in Hughart&#x27;s writing, from mystery, Chinese myths, humor, and thrill, to potions, magic plants, ghosts, and spells. &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; is as much a fantasy as a mystery, a long complex journey. Hughart imagined his own China with its own unique history, and each novel in his series builds upon the others. Hughart drew on numerous sources to create the Chinese mythology of &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;.

===Films===
Hughart also wrote dialogue for the following films:

* &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bride&quot; (1968) 
* &quot;Honeymoon with a Stranger&quot; (1969) 
* &quot;Man on the Move&quot; (Jigsaw) (1972) 
* &quot;Welcome Home, Johnny Bristol&quot; (1972) 
* &quot;The Other Side of Hell&quot; (1978) 
* &quot;Special Effects&quot; (1984) 
* &quot;Snow Job&quot; (1983–1985) 
* &quot;When the Bough Breaks&quot; (1986)

== Death ==
A small note was posted to barryhughart.org stating &quot;It has been confirmed as of 1-Aug-2019 that Mr. Hughart has passed on.&quot; &quot;Locus&quot; magazine also published a brief obituary indicating his date of death as 1 August 2019.

<doc id="312737" wikidata="Q7095403" url="?curid=312737" title="Oor Wullie">
<text>Oor Wullie () is a Scottish comic strip published in the D.C. Thomson newspaper &quot;The Sunday Post&quot;. It features a character called Wullie; Wullie is a Scots nickname for boys named William, equivalent to Willie. His trademarks are spiky hair, dungarees and an upturned bucket, which he uses as a seat: most strips since early 1937 begin and end with a single panel of Wullie sitting on his bucket. The earliest strips, with little dialogue, ended with Wullie complaining (e.g., &quot;I nivver get ony fun roond here!&quot;). The artistic style settled down by 1940 and has changed little since. A frequent tagline reads, &quot;Oor Wullie! Your Wullie! A&#x27;body&#x27;s Wullie!&quot; (Our Willie! Your Willie! Everybody&#x27;s Willie!).

Created by Thomson editor R. D. Low and drawn by cartoonist Dudley D. Watkins, the strip first appeared on 8 March 1936. Watkins continued to draw &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; until his death in 1969, after which the &quot;Post&quot; recycled his work into the 1970s. New strips were eventually commissioned from Tom Lavery, followed by Peter Davidson and Robert Nixon. Ken H. Harrison drew the strip from 1989 until 1997, when Davidson resumed duties. Between January 2005 and 2006, storylines were written by broadcaster Tom Morton from his home in Shetland, and subsequently they were written by Dave Donaldson, managing director of Thomson&#x27;s comics division. Former &quot;Dandy&quot; editor Morris Heggie took over as editor and main writer on Donaldson&#x27;s departure, and continued to write the strips until 2022. In more recent years writers have included Georgia Battle, Kate Dewar, Gerard Dignan, Craig Ferguson, Hector Mac, Daniel McGachey, and others, with writer and artist credits now appearing alongside the strips in The Sunday Post. 

Between 2016 and 2017, artist Diego Jourdan Pereira filled in for Peter Davidson on Wullie, The Broons and Wee Harry. Jourdan Pereira also provided illustrations for the 2017 Annual and official merchandising. 

Since Peter Davidson&#x27;s retirement, Oor Wullie has been drawn by Mike Donaldson, who also took over art duties on The Broons and wee Harry strips, as well as PC Murdoch Mysteries on the retirement of Ken Harrison in 2023. Occasional strips have been drawn by Gary Welsh. 

== Characters and story ==

Although Wullie&#x27;s hometown was unnamed in the original Watkins strips, it has been called Auchenshoogle since the late 1990s.

Wullie&#x27;s gang consists of himself, Fat Bob, Wee Eck and Soapy Soutar. Wullie is the self-proclaimed leader, a position which is frequently disputed by the others. In early strips, the gang met in a wooden shed - usually located in the garden at Wullie&#x27;s house. He also owns a pet mouse named Jeemy (Scots for &#x27;Jimmy&#x27;).

Wullie and his friends roam the streets of his town, though he is sometimes depicted at school, which he finds confining. Praise from his teacher, who addresses him as &quot;William&quot;, is rare and acutely embarrassing. His adventures often consist of unrealistic get-rich-quick schemes that lead to mischief, to the despair of his parents, Ma and Pa. Wullie&#x27;s Pa is called &quot;Tam&quot;; the only reference to this is in a strip from the 1960s during a conversation between Pa and the local policeman, Wullie&#x27;s arch-nemesis, P.C. Murdoch.

Famous people such as Nicola Sturgeon, Ewan McGregor, Andy Murray and Amy Macdonald have appeared in the strip over the years. In December 2016, Nicola Sturgeon featured Oor Wullie on a Christmas card, with the original illustration being auctioned for charity.

When &quot;The Topper&quot; launched in 1953, Oor Wullie appeared in the masthead, although not as a story in the comic. He often appeared sitting on his bucket, though other poses were used as well. The pose on Topper No. 1 had him wearing a top hat. He had the top hat in one hand and the other hand pointing at the &quot;Topper&quot; logo.

==Annuals==
Starting in 1940, the &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; strips also appeared in the form of a Christmas annual which alternated every second year with “The Broons”, another D. C. Thomson product. (No annuals were published between 1943 and 1946.) Pre-1966 annuals were undated. 

A facsimile of the first &quot;The Broons&quot; annual was released on 25 November 2006 and of the first &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; annual the following year, celebrating the 70th anniversaries of the strips.

Following the 80th anniversary in 2016, additional annuals of Oor Wullie were issued for 2016 and 2018, breaking from the biennial pattern. 

Since 1996 - the 60th anniversary of the strip - D.C. Thomson has also published a series of compilation books featuring &quot;The Broons&quot; and &quot;Oor Wullie&quot; on alternate pages.

The early stories are often recycled in current annuals. An example being the &quot;twin cousin&quot; story in the 2018 annual being first seen in the fifties.

==Bucket Trails==

In celebration of Oor Wullie&#x27;s 80th anniversary in 2016, he was the subject of a public art project when 55 decorated 5 ft sculptures of him were placed around Dundee and its environs with another 13 touring round Scotland over an 8-week period. The Bucket Trail was the largest mass public art project to have taken place in Scotland. The project ran from 27 June for two months, with the sculptures being auctioned in September for £883,000, for a new pediatric surgical suite at Tayside Children&#x27;s Hospital. In 2019 Oor Wullie&#x27;s BIG Bucket Trail 2019 was launched with 200 artistic interpretations of the figure at locations in cities across Scotland, raising money for Edinburgh Children&#x27;s Hospital, Glasgow Children&#x27;s Hospital and the Archie Foundation.

<doc id="312749" wikidata="Q5163231" url="?curid=312749" title="Consistory court">
<text>A consistory court is a type of ecclesiastical court, especially within the Church of England where they were originally established pursuant to a charter of King William the Conqueror, and still exist today, although since about the middle of the 19th century consistory courts have lost much of their subject-matter jurisdiction. Each diocese in the Church of England has a consistory court (called in the Diocese of Canterbury the &quot;Commissary Court&quot;).

== History of consistory courts in England ==
Consistory courts have been in existence in England since shortly after the Norman conquest and their jurisdiction and operation was essentially unaffected by the English reformations. Originally, the jurisdiction of consistory courts was very wide indeed and covered such matters as defamation, probate, and matrimonial causes as well as a general jurisdiction over both clergy and laity in relation to matters relating to church discipline and to morality more generally and to the use and control of consecrated church property within the diocese. The judge of the consistory court, appointed by the bishop, was the bishop&#x27;s official principal and vicar-general of the diocese and became known in his judicial capacity by the title &quot;chancellor&quot;.

Appeals lay from the consistory court to the provincial court of the archbishop. In the province of Canterbury, the archbishop&#x27;s court was known as the Court of Arches and was presided over by the archbishop&#x27;s official principal, known as the dean of the Arches. In the province of York, appeals lay to the Chancery Court of York presided over by the archbishop of York&#x27;s official principal, the auditor. Until 1532 further appeal lay to Rome; thereafter further appeal was to the Crown.

By the end of the eighteenth century, the exercise of jurisdiction over the laity in moral matters had fallen into desuetude. But there was no reform of the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts until the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1855 the defamation jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical court was brought to an end and in 1857 the probate jurisdiction was transferred to the newly created Court of Probate and the matrimonial jurisdiction to the newly created Divorce Court. Both of these new courts were temporal rather than ecclesiastical courts; but their procedure continued (as it continues to this day) to reflect the ecclesiastical origins of the jurisdiction with, for example, matrimonial proceedings being by way of petition and the &quot;citation&quot; of parties in probate proceedings. A major part of the jurisdiction left to the ecclesiastical courts was that which concerned the control of consecrated ecclesiastical property – essentially churches and their churchyards and certain other consecrated places such as municipal burial grounds. The other major aspect of their jurisdiction which remained was their criminal jurisdiction in relation to the clergy – i.e. their jurisdiction to deal with allegations of ecclesiastical offences against the clergy (for example for immoral conduct, neglect of duty or in relation to doctrinal or ceremonial matters). Their corrective jurisdiction over clergy was abrogated by the Church Discipline Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 86). However, by the Clergy Discipline Act 1892 (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. 32), a clergyman may be prosecuted and tried in a consistory court for immoral acts or conduct. Under this act, either party may appeal to a secular court or the monarch in Council.

Following a report in 1954 from the Archbishops’ Commission on Ecclesiastical Courts, the ecclesiastical courts were put on a statutory footing by the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1963. The jurisdiction of the consistory courts was not much altered by the 1963 Measure save that criminal jurisdiction over the clergy where the case involved a question of doctrine, ritual or ceremonial was transferred to a new court called the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved (which continues to have that role).

A further reform took place more recently when the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003 transferred the criminal jurisdiction over the clergy (other than in relation to matters of doctrine, ritual or ceremonial) to new &quot;bishop&#x27;s tribunals&quot; with modern tribunal procedure and a revised scheme of statutory penalties.

== Officers of the Consistory Court During the Early Modern Period ==

During the early modern period it became increasingly common for the bishop of an anglican diocese, or the archdeacon of a rural deanery, to delegate jurisdiction of the diocesan consistory court to a chancellor, who presided over cases such as probations of estates, excommunications, underpayment of tithables, and other serious moral transgressions within the diocese. This allowed the diocesan bishop and other clergy to focus on spiritual matters and retain an advocate learned in the law to oversee the administration of the inquisitorial court cases. The chancellor typically sat on a throne at the front of the ecclesiastical courtroom, presiding over the well where the proctors and litigants would sit. The diocesan registrar would sit on a slightly lower bench to the chancellor&#x27;s right, which would contain a small table allowing them to record the details of the court cases brought by the proctors, similar to a clerk in a temporal common law court.

Inside a wooden enclosure before the chancellor and registrar would typically be a round table at which the proctors and litigants would sit. In contrast with the rectilinear benches for the attorneys in a temporal English common law courtroom, the round table of the ecclesiastical courtroom symbolized that within the inquisitorial system of the anglican church, the role of proctors and litigants was to help inform the court of the truth, regardless of the best interest of whom they were hired to represent. Proctors could charge ecclesiastical litigants higher fees for cases that extended for longer amounts of time, so proctors would often ask chancellors to delay adjudication of disputes until further investigation could be conducted, allowing the proctors more time to ask for higher fees from the litigants. Often, proctors would bring cases against parishioners where no dispute previously existed, or even against the advice of clergy such as parish priests and bishop&#x27;s assistants. This sometimes led to disputes between the clergy, who were more concerned with forgiving the parishioners&#x27; sins from a religious perspective, and the proctors, who were more concerned with using the absolution and punishment of sins as a mechanism to make a greater profit for the church court. 

Finally, apparitors of the ecclesiastical court would ensure the appearance of ecclesiastical defendants before the chancellor and carry out some of the ecclesiastical punishments upon conviction, similar to the role of a bailiff or constable in a temporal English common law court. The apparitors would typically sit in a chair overlooking the well of the court as well as the entrance to the diocesan courtroom from the nave of the cathedral, allowing them to call litigants before the court and ensure the operation of the cases. Additionally, apparitors might also ensure the appearance of ecclesiastical defendants by overseeing the church prison for the archdeaconry, diocese, or archdiocese. They were generally paid based upon the number of summonses they served each month to litigants, although one apparitor might work for multiple dioceses or archdeaconries when the caseloads were low, or also receive a small salary for their general duties to the court in some of the larger dioceses and archdioceses.
==Jurisdiction today==
=== Status and powers of consistory courts ===
Consistory courts are the King&#x27;s courts with the ultimate appellate authority being either His Majesty in Council (i.e. the Privy Council) or a Commission of Review directed by His Majesty under the Great Seal.

They are superior courts in the sense that it need not appear in any proceedings or judgements of a consistory court that the court was acting within its jurisdiction; but they are inferior courts in the sense that they can be stopped from exceeding their jurisdiction by a prohibiting order granted on judicial review.

A consistory court has the same powers as the High Court in relation to the attendance and examination of witnesses and the production and inspection of documents.

If any person does or omits to do anything in connection with proceedings before, or with an order made by, a consistory court that constitutes contempt of the consistory court, that person is liable to be punished by the High Court as if that person had been guilty of contempt of the High Court.

=== Matters within the consistory courts&#x27; jurisdiction ===
The consistory court of a diocese has jurisdiction to hear and determine: 
* proceedings for obtaining a faculty to authorise an act relating to land in the diocese, or to something on, in or otherwise appertaining to land there, for which a faculty is required; 
* proceedings for an order under section 21 of the Care of Churches and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1991 (delivery of article to place of safety); 
* proceedings for obtaining a faculty under section 4 of the Faculty Jurisdiction Measure 1964 (sale of books in parochial library); 
* proceedings for an injunction or a restoration order under section 13 of the Care of Churches and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1991; 
* proceedings under section 68(7) or (12) of the Mission and Pastoral Measure 2011 (enforcement or interpretation of leases); 
* proceedings under section 71(9) of that measure (compensation for loss of burial rights); 
* proceedings upon a awarded by the bishop of the diocese; 
* any other proceedings which, immediately before the passing of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1963 on 31 July 1963, the court had power to determine (except proceedings the jurisdiction for which was expressly abolished by that measure).

=== Faculty jurisdiction ===
The exercise of the faculty jurisdiction forms the very great majority of the work of the consistory courts today – the rest of the statutory jurisdiction being largely concerned with rather technical matters of ecclesiastical law and only rarely invoked.

As a general rule, land and buildings become subject to the jurisdiction of the consistory court by virtue of being consecrated by the bishop of the diocese. In the case of more recently built churches there will be a formal record of consecration; in the case of ancient churches, there is a legal presumption that they have been consecrated. All parish churches, and certain other buildings and land even though not consecrated, are subject to the faculty jurisdiction. The consecrated parts of municipal cemeteries are subject to the faculty jurisdiction.

A faculty is required for any material alteration in such a church or its churchyard.

A faculty is required for the disturbance or removal of human remains that have been buried in consecrated land; it is a criminal offence to remove a body from consecrated land without the authority of a faculty.

The jurisdiction also extends to all the goods appertaining to such a church, as well as to its fabric and any fittings annexed to the realty, and also to the churchyard.

It is because of the existence of the faculty jurisdiction that the &quot;ecclesiastical exemption&quot; from listed building control is provided for in heritage protection legislation, Parliament having taken the view that there was already in place, in relation to the buildings and land of the Church of England that were in ecclesiastical use, a satisfactory legal regime controlling their use and alteration. (The benefit of the exemption is extended under the current heritage protection legislation to the buildings of other denominations who have satisfied the Secretary of State that they have established adequate regimes for preserving the historic and architectural character of their listed ecclesiastical buildings.) Much of the work of the consistory courts today involves applying principles of ecclesiastical law to applications (&quot;petitions&quot;) for faculties to make alterations to listed church buildings. Those legal principles have been developed in recent years expressly to take account of the desirability of preserving the historic and architectural character of the church&#x27;s listed buildings but in such a way that the needs – particularly those that relate to the mission of the church – are fully taken into account in determining faculty petitions that seek the making of changes to listed churches. The criteria to be adopted by consistory courts when considering proposals for the alteration of churches which are listed buildings under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 are set out in &quot;Re St Alkmund, Duffield&quot; [2013] Fam 158, a decision of the Arches Court of Canterbury.

== Judge ==
Each Consistory court is presided over by a single judge who is styled the &quot;Chancellor of the Diocese&quot; (or in Canterbury the &quot;Commissary-General&quot;).

The chancellor is appointed by the bishop of the diocese by letters patent following consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Dean of the Arches and Auditor.

Ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the diocese, both contentious and voluntary, is committed to the Chancellor under two separate offices, those of &quot;official principal&quot; and &quot;vicar-general&quot;: the distinction between the two offices is that the official principal usually exercises contentious jurisdiction and the vicar-general voluntary jurisdiction.

A person is eligible for appointment as chancellor only if the person holds or has held high judicial office, holds or has held the office of circuit judge, or has the qualifications required for holding the office of circuit judge. A lay person must be a communicant of the Church of England to be eligible. The chancellor takes the judicial oath, the oath of allegiance and, if a lay person, makes the Declaration of Assent required by Canon G 2 of the Canons of the Church of England. The chancellor may be removed by the bishop only if the Upper House of the Convocation of the province resolves that he is incapable of acting or unfit to act.

Chancellors are addressed on the bench as &quot;Worshipful Sir&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot; and are styled &quot;The Worshipful&quot;.

When sitting, chancellors wear the same black silk gown that was formerly worn by judges in the Chancery Division of the High Court and by certain other judges, with a short wig, collar and bands. On ceremonial occasions chancellors wear a full-bottomed wig and the silk gown is worn over a court coat, court waistcoat with lace jabot and knee breaches, silk stockings and patent leather pumps with buckles.

The consistory court itself is styled &quot;this venerable court&quot;. Most have a mace, carried by the apparitor, who is usually a member of the staff of the diocesan registry and who was historically the official who served the processes of the court and caused defendants to appear by summons.

There may also be a deputy chancellor who may exercise the court&#x27;s jurisdiction in the same way as the chancellor. In order to be appointed a deputy chancellor a person must have the qualifications required to be appointed a chancellor.

==Procedure==
The procedure to be followed by the court and by parties in faculty proceedings are set out in the Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2015.

The consistory court usually sits &quot;on paper&quot; without formal hearings. Contentious cases can be determined on consideration of written representations if the chancellor considers it expedient and all the parties agree.

When hearings are required they can be held in any convenient building; which might be the church to which the proceedings relate or an existing court building or a school or community hall made available for the purpose. Historically some consistory courts were housed in the cathedral church of the diocese and some cathedrals still contain court rooms, although these are now used for other purposes. For example, the former consistory court at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is now the Chapel of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. One of the oldest surviving complete ecclesiastical courtrooms in Great Britain is the consistory court at Chester Cathedral. Probably the oldest known example (1617) is in the Chapel of St Nicholas, King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk.

Until the latter part of the nineteenth century there were legal practitioners in England known as &quot;advocates&quot; who practised solely in ecclesiastical and admiralty law and formed a chartered institution called Doctors&#x27; Commons. After the transfer of much of the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to new, temporal courts in the 1850s, Doctors’ Commons declined and was eventually closed. Thereafter, counsel (i.e. barristers) were permitted to appear in the ecclesiastical courts and nowadays solicitors also appear. The only limitation that exists in relation to representation is the issue of funding. Where commercial interests are involved in contested faculty proceedings (e.g. a petition to allow the grant of a way leave to a utility undertaker) legal representation is usually engaged by the petitioners. Where the petitioners are private individuals or parochial church councils they may not have the resources to instruct solicitors and counsel; though it is not uncommon for counsel to appear &quot;pro bono&quot;.

==Registrars==
The registrar of the diocese is also the registrar of the consistory court. The qualification for appointment as a registrar is a general qualification within the meaning of section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. He was usually also the legal secretary to the bishop, and now must be a legal adviser, and is registrar to the archdeacons. He must be learned in ecclesiastical law, and be a communicant of the Church of England. He is appointed by the bishop after consultation with the Bishop&#x27;s Council and the Standing Committee of Diocesan Synod.

There may be a deputy registrar who carries out some of the work of the registrar. There may be a separate clerk of the court, if there might be a conflict of interest for the registrar to act in this capacity.

Each consistory court has a seal, which is in the care of the registrar.

==Discipline of clergy==
Consistory courts no longer have criminal (i.e. disciplinary) jurisdiction over the clergy.

The machinery under which the clergy formally could be disciplined in a consistory court was contained in the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1963. Courts were convened on only three occasions under that legislation. The last discipline case to be heard by a consistory court was that of Brandon Jackson, the Dean of Lincoln, who was acquitted of sexual misconduct in 1995. A number of disciplinary cases have subsequently been heard by the new bishops&#x27; disciplinary tribunals established by the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003.

==Appeals==
An appeal generally lies from the consistory court of a diocese to the Court of Arches or the Chancery Court of York, depending on whether the diocese is in the Province of Canterbury or the Province of York. Permission to appeal is needed, either from the consistory court or from the appeal court. However, if the appeal to any extent relates to a matter involving doctrine, ritual or ceremonial then the appeal lies instead to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved and permission to appeal is not needed. For determining the court to which an appeal lies, on the application of a party to the proceedings in the consistory court the chancellor must give a certificate stating whether or not the proposed appeal relates to any extent to a matter involving doctrine, ritual or ceremonial. The chancellor must also, if the appeal lies to the Court of Arches or the Chancery Court of York, decide whether to give permission to appeal.

In faculty cases, a further appeal lies from the Court of Arches or the Chancery Court of York to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council but only with the permission of the Judicial Committee. A decision of the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved can be appealed from by presenting a petition to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery that His Majesty appoint a Commission of Review.

<text>The hanbō (半棒, &quot;half-staff&quot;) is a staff used in martial arts. Traditionally, the &quot;hanbō&quot; was approximately three &quot;shaku&quot; or about long, half the length of the usual staff, the &quot;rokushakubō&quot; (&quot;six &quot;shaku&quot; staff&quot;). Diameter was . However, depending on the school the length and diameter varied.

As with any weapon, bearers would often find one best suited to their build, opting often for one that comes up to about waist/hip height.

==Usage==
Hanbōjutsu, the art of wielding the &quot;hanbō&quot;, is a focus in several martial arts including the &quot;Kukishin-ryū&quot; &quot;koryū&quot; classical school of martial arts, and &quot;Kukishinden-ryū&quot;, one of the nine schools of &quot;Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu&quot;. Part of the importance in using this length is that it is approximately that of a walking cane. Although techniques with a cane in this &quot;ryū-ha&quot; utilize pulling or hooking and possess one rounded end, they invariably function the same as a &quot;hanbō&quot; in all other respects. The hanbō can be held toward one end, and be swung like a katana or kendo sword. Additionally, it can be held in the middle like a staff and strike and block from either end.

The &quot;hanbō&quot; can be used as a means of striking, restraining or even throwing someone.
It is useful to know because sticks are abundant and can be picked up if attacked. Masaaki Hatsumi says that one who wishes to be a swordsman should first master &quot;hanbō&quot; techniques, since it can be held and utilized in a similar fashion to a Japanese sword (but without the cutting edge). When utilized properly (parrying by deflecting the sword by striking the flat parts of the blade), it can be used against a &quot;katana&quot;.

<text>A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders in the Catholic Church. There are also friars outside of the Catholic Church, such as within the Anglican Communion. The term, first used in the 12th or 13th century, distinguishes the mendicants&#x27; itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders&#x27; allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. A friar may be in holy orders or be a non-ordained brother. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, and Carmelites.

==Definition==
Friars are different from monks in that they are called to the great evangelical counsels (vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience) in service to society, rather than through cloistered asceticism and devotion. Whereas monks live in a self-sufficient community, friars work among laypeople and are supported by donations or other charitable support. Monks or nuns make their vows and commit to a particular community in a particular place. Friars commit to a community spread across a wider geographical area known as a province and so they will typically move around, spending time in different houses of the community within their province.

==Etymology==
The English term &quot;friar&quot; is derived from the Norman French word &quot;frere&quot; (brother), from the Latin &quot;frater&quot; (brother), which was widely used in the Latin New Testament to refer to members of the Christian community. Fray is sometimes used in Spain and former Spanish colonies such as the Philippines or the American Southwest as a title, such as in Fray Juan de Torquemada.

==Orders==

In the Catholic church, there are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four great orders and the so-called lesser orders.

===Major orders===
The four great orders were mentioned by the Second Council of Lyons (1274):

* The Carmelites, founded 1155. They are also known as the White Friars because of the white cloak which covers their brown habit. They received papal approval from Honorius III in 1226 and later by Innocent IV in 1247. The Carmelites were founded as a purely contemplative order, but became mendicants in 1245. There are two types of Carmelites, those of the Ancient Observance (OCarm) and those of the Discalced Carmelites (OCD), founded by St. Teresa of Ávila in the 16th century. 

* The Franciscans, founded in 1209. They are also known as the Friars Minor. The Franciscans were founded by St. Francis of Assisi and received oral papal approval by Innocent III in 1209 and formal papal confirmation by Honorius III in 1223. Today the Friars Minor is composed of three branches: the Order of Friars Minor (Brown Franciscans), Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (Brown Friars with long pointed hoods) and the Order of Friars Minor Conventual wearing grey or black habits (thus known as Grey Friars). In the Franciscan order, a friar may be an ordained priest or a religious brother.
* The Dominicans, founded 1216. They are also known as the Friar Preachers or the Black Friars from the black mantle (cappa) worn over their white habit. The Dominicans were founded by St. Dominic and received papal approval from Honorius III in 1216 as the Ordo Praedicatorum under the Rule of St. Augustine. They became a mendicant order in 1221. There are also Dominican Orders within the Anglican Communion, such as the Order of Christ the Saviour.
* The Augustinians, founded in 1244 (the &quot;Little Union&quot;) and enlarged in 1256 (the Grand Union). They are also known as the Hermits of St. Augustine or the Austin Friars. Their rule is based on the writings of Augustine of Hippo. The Augustinians were assembled from various groups of hermits as a mendicant order by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 (Little Union). Additional groups were added by Alexander IV in 1256 (Grand Union).

===Lesser orders===
Some of the lesser orders are: 
* The Trinitarians, established in 1198
* The Mercedarians, established in 1218
* The Servites, established in 1240
* The Minims, established in 1474
* The Third Order Regular of St. Francis, a branch of the Third Order of St. Francis, part of the Franciscan Order established in 1447
* The Discalced Carmelites, established in 1568 
* The Order of Augustinian Recollects, established in 1598 through the Chapter of Toledo
* The Discalced Trinitarians, established in 1599
* The Order of Penance, established in 1781.

===Order of Malta===
In the Sovereign Military Order of Malta the term Fra&#x27; (an abbreviation for the Latin word &quot;frater&quot; meaning &quot;brother&quot;) is used when addressing the professed Knights of Justice who have taken vows.

==Other Christian traditions==
Orders of friars (and sisters) exist in other Christian traditions, including the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, the Order of Ecumenical Franciscans and the Order of Lesser Sisters and Brothers. In the Anglican Communion there are also a number of mendicant groups such as the Anglican Friars Preachers, the Society of Saint Francis and the Order of St Francis.

==Other usage of the term==
Several high schools, as well as Providence College, use friars as their school mascot.

The Major League Baseball team San Diego Padres have the Swinging Friar (&quot;padre&quot; is also a Spanish word for the priestly title &quot;father&quot;; in 1769 San Diego was founded by Spanish Franciscan friars under Junípero Serra).

The University of Michigan&#x27;s oldest a cappella group is a male octet known as The Friars. The University of Pennsylvania has a senior honor society known as Friars. Sports teams at Father Dueñas Memorial School on the island of Guam are known as the Friars.

<text>Beersheba (, / ), officially Be&#x27;er-Sheva, is the largest city in the Negev desert of southern Israel. Often referred to as the &quot;Capital of the Negev&quot;, it is the centre of the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in Israel, the eighth-most populous Israeli city with a population of , and the second-largest city in area (after Jerusalem), with a total area of 117,500 dunams (45 mi2 / 117.5 km2).

Human habitation near present-day Beersheba dates back to the fourth millennium BC. In the Bible, Beersheba marks the southern boundary of ancient Israel, as mentioned in the phrase &quot;From Dan to Beersheba.&quot; Initially assigned to the Tribe of Judah, Beersheba was later reassigned to Simeon. During the monarchic era, it functioned as a royal city but eventually faced destruction at the hands of the Assyrians. The Biblical site of Beersheba is Tel Be&#x27;er Sheva, lying some 4 km distant from the modern city, which was established at the start of the 20th century by the Ottomans. The city was captured by the British-led Australian Light Horse troops in the Battle of Beersheba during World War I.

The population of the town was completely changed in 1948–49 during the First Arab–Israeli War. Beersheba had been almost entirely Muslim, and the 1947 UN Partition Plan designated it to be part of the Arab state. It was occupied by the Egyptian army from May 1948 until October 1948 when it was captured by the Israel Defense Forces and part of the Arab population was expelled. Today, the metropolitan area is composed of approximately equal Jewish and Arab populations, with a large portion of the Jewish population made up of the descendants of Sephardi Jews and Mizrahi Jews who fled, relocated or were expelled from Arab countries after Israel&#x27;s founding in 1948, as well as smaller communities of Bene Israel and Cochin Jews from India. Second and third waves of immigration have taken place since 1990, bringing Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union as well as Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia. The Soviet immigrants have made the game of chess a major sport in Beersheba, and it is now Israel&#x27;s national chess center, with more chess grandmasters per capita than any other city in the world.

Beersheba is home to Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. This city also serves as a center for Israel&#x27;s high-tech and developing technology industry.

==Etymology==
The Book of Genesis gives two etymologies for the name &quot;Be&#x27;er Sheba&quot;. Genesis 21:28-31 relates:Then Abraham set seven ewes apart. And Abimelech said to Abraham, &quot;What mean these seven ewes, which you have set apart? And [Abraham] said, &quot;That you are to take these seven (&quot;sheba&quot;) ewes from me, to be for me a witness that I have dug this well (&quot;bǝ&#x27;er&quot;).&quot; Therefore the name of that place was Be&#x27;er Sheba, for there the two of them had sworn (&quot;nishbǝ&#x27;u&quot;).Genesis 26 relates:And Isaac redug the wells which had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, and which the Philistines had sealed after the death of Abraham, and he used the same names as had his father . . . And they arose in the morning, and they swore (&quot;wa-yishabǝ&#x27;u&quot;) each to his fellow, and Isaac sent them off, and they departed him in peace. On that same day, Isaac&#x27;s men came to him to tell him of the well which they had dug, and they said to him, &quot;We found water.&quot; And he called it &quot;Shib&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;seven&quot; normally, possibly &quot;oath&quot; or a proper noun); therefore the name of the city is Be&#x27;er Sheba to this day.The original Hebrew name could therefore relate to the oath of Abraham and Abimelech (&#x27;well of the oath&#x27;) or the seven ewes in that oath (&#x27;well of the seven&#x27;), as related in , and/or to the oath of Isaac and Abimelech in . Alternatively, Obadiah Sforno suggested that the well is called Seven because it was the seventh dug; the narrative of Genesis 26 includes three wells dug by Abraham which are reopened by Isaac (Esek, Sitnah, Rehoboth), for a total of six, after which Isaac goes to Beersheba, the seventh well.

The double name of Shib&#x27;a and Beersheba is referenced again by the Masoretic Text in Joshua 19:2, usually translated &quot;Beersheba or Sheba&quot;; however the Septuagint reads &quot;Beersheba and Samaa (Σαμαὰ)&quot; which fits with MT 1 Chron. 4:28.

Abraham ibn Ezra and Samuel b. Meir suggest the two etymologies refer to two different cities.

During the Ottoman administration, the city was referred as (&quot;Belediye Birüsseb&quot;).

==Hebrew Bible==
Beersheba is mainly dealt with in the Hebrew Bible in connection with the Patriarchs Abraham and Isaac, who both dug a well and close peace treaties with King Abimelech of Gerar at the site. Hence it receives its name twice, first after Abraham&#x27;s dealings with Abimelech (), and again from Isaac who closes his own covenant with Abimelech of Gerar and whose servants also dig a well there (). The place is thus connected to two of the three Wife–sister narratives in the Book of Genesis.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Beersheba was founded when Abraham and Abimelech settled their differences over a well of water and made a covenant (see ). Abimelech&#x27;s men had taken the well from Abraham after he had previously dug it so Abraham brought sheep and cattle to Abimelech to get the well back. He set aside seven lambs to swear that it was he that had dug the well and no one else. Abimelech conceded that the well belonged to Abraham and, in the Bible, Beersheba means &quot;Well of Seven&quot; or &quot;Well of the Oath&quot;.

Beersheba is further mentioned in the following Bible passages: Isaac built an altar in Beersheba (Genesis 26:23–33). Jacob had his dream about a stairway to heaven after leaving Beersheba. (Genesis 28:10–15 and 46:1–7). Beersheba was the territory of the tribe of Simeon and Judah (Joshua 15:28 and 19:2). The sons of the prophet Samuel were judges in Beersheba (I Samuel 8:2). Saul, Israel&#x27;s first king, built a fort there for his campaign against the Amalekites (I Samuel 14:48 and 15:2–9). The prophet Elijah took refuge in Beersheba when Jezebel ordered him killed (I Kings 19:3). The prophet Amos mentions the city in regard to idolatry (Amos 5:5 and 8:14). Following the Babylonian conquest and subsequent enslavement of many Israelites, the town was abandoned. After the Israelite slaves returned from Babylon, they resettled the town. According to the Hebrew Bible, Beersheba was the southernmost city of the territories settled by Israelites, hence the expression &quot;from Dan to Beersheba&quot; to describe the whole kingdom.

Zibiah, the consort of King Ahaziah of Judah and the mother of King Jehoash of Judah, was from Beersheba.

==History==

The city has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. Considered unimportant for centuries, Be’er Sheva regained notoriety under Byzantine rule (in the 4th–7th century), when it was a key point on the Limes Palestinae, a defense line built against the desert tribes; however, it fell to the Arabs in the 7th century and to the Turks in the 16th century.

It long remained a watering place and small trade centre for the nomadic Bedouin tribes of the Negev, despite Turkish efforts at town planning and development around 1900. Its capture in 1917 by the British Army opened the way for their conquest of Palestine and Syria. After being taken by Israeli troops in October 1948, Beersheba was rapidly settled by new immigrants and has since developed as the administrative, cultural, and industrial centre of the Negev. It is one of the largest cities in Israel outside of metropolitan Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa.

===Chalcolithic===
Human settlement in the area dates from the Copper Age. The inhabitants lived in caves, crafting metal tools and raising cattle. Findings unearthed at Tel Be&#x27;er Sheva, an archaeological site east of modern-day Beersheba, suggest the region has been inhabited since the 4th millennium BC (between 5000 and 6,000 years ago).

===Iron Age Israelite town===
Tel Be&#x27;er Sheva, an archaeological site containing the ruins of an ancient town believed to have been the Biblical Beersheba, lies a few kilometers east of the modern city. The town dates to the early Israelite period, around the 10th century BCE. The site was possibly chosen due to the abundance of water, as evidenced by the numerous wells in the area. According to the Hebrew Bible, the wells were dug by Abraham and Isaac when they arrived there. The streets were laid out in a grid, with separate areas for administrative, commercial, military, and residential use. It is believed to have been the first planned settlement in the region, and is also noteworthy for its elaborate water system; in particular, a huge cistern carved out of the rock beneath the town.

===Persian period===
During the Persian rule 539 BC–c. 332 BC, Beersheba was at the south of Yehud Medinata autonomous province of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. During that era, the city was rebuilt and a citadel had been constructed. Archeological finds from between 359 and 338 BC have been made, finding pottery and an ostracon.

===Hellenistic period===
During the Hasmonean rule, the city was not attributed great importance as it was not mentioned when conquered from Edom or described in the Hasmonean wars.

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
Around 64-63 BC, the Roman general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus made Beersheba, known as Birosaba, the southern part of the Judea province. During the Herodian period there was a small settlement in Beersheba. Remains of a Jewish village dating back to the 1st century AD were discovered in the Harkapet neighborhood in the north of the city.

In the following years, the town served as front-line defence against Nabatean attacks and was on the limes belt, which in this region is attributed to the time of Vespasian (1st century AD). The city become the centre of an eparchy around 268. During the Roman and Byzantine periods, the city developed significantly and the burial grounds on the outskirts of the city became residential areas. The inhabitants, which consisted of Nabataeans, Jews and other ethnicities, spoke primarily Greek and lived from olive oil production, viticulture, agricultural and other trades.

After the reforms of Diocletian, the town became part of the province of Palaestina Tertia and grew to an approximate size of 60 hectares during its peak in the 6th century. Beersheba was described in the Madaba Map and Eusebius of Caesarea as a large village with a Roman garrison. The camp was later identified in aerial photographs taken during the First World War and other structures associated with the camp, such as a bath house and dwellings, were found in later excavations.

During the Byzantine period, at least six churches were built there, one of which is the largest church to have been excavated in the Negev. Some of the churches were still in use until the Umayyad period but it remains uncertain whether they continued beyond the early eight century. Monasticism is also attested in historical documents and one structure has been identified as a monastery. Barsanuphius of Gaza corresponded with a certain monk of Beersheba, John, who might be identified with John the Prophet, who between 525 and 527 moved to the monastery of Seridus and together with Barsanuphius wrote over 850 letters on spiritual direction.

=== Early Muslim period ===
During the early Muslim period, some of the Byzantine buildings continued to be used, but there was a slow decline of the city, which was manifested in the demolition of the public buildings and their transformation into a source of raw material for secondary construction. In the second half of the 8th century, the city was apparently abandoned.

===Mamluk period===
In 1483, during the late Mamluk era, the pilgrim Felix Fabri noted Beersheba as a city. Fabri also noted that Beersheba marked the southern-most border of &quot;the Holy Land&quot;.

===Ottoman period===


The present-day city was built to serve as an administrative center by the Ottoman administration for the benefit of the Bedouin at the outset of the 20th century and was given the name of &quot;Bir al-Sabi&quot; (well of the seven). Until World War I, it was an overwhelmingly Muslim township with some 1,000 residents. Ben-David and Kressel have argued that the Bedouin traditional market was the cornerstone for the founding of Beersheba as capital of the Negev during this period, and Negev Bedouin. Anthropologist and educationalist Aref Abu-Rabia, who worked for the Israeli Ministry of Education and Culture, described it as &quot;the first Bedouin city&quot;.

In June 1899, the Ottoman government ordered the creation of the Beersheba sub-district (&quot;kaza&quot;) of the district (&quot;mutasarrıflık&quot;) of Jerusalem, with Beersheba to be developed as its capital. Implementation was entrusted to a special bureau of the Ministry of the Interior. The British incorporation of Sinai into Egypt led to a need for the Ottomans to consolidate their hold on southern Palestine. There was also a desire to encourage the Bedouin to become sedentary, with a predicted increase of tranquility and tax revenue. The first governor (&quot;kaymakam&quot;), Isma&#x27;il Kamal Bey, lived in a tent lent by the local sheikh until the government house (&quot;Saraya&quot;) was built. Kamal was replaced by Muhammed Carullah Efendi in 1901, who in turn was replaced by Hamdi Bey in 1903. The governor in 1908 was promoted to &#x27;adjoint&#x27; (&quot;mutassarrıf muavin&quot;) to the governor of the Jerusalem district, which placed him above the other sub-district governors.

A visitor to Beersheba in May 1900 found only a ruin, a two-storey stone khan, and several tents. By the start of 1901 there was a barracks with a small garrison as well as other buildings. The Austro-Hungarian-Czech orientalist Alois Musil noted in August 1902:
: Bir es-Seba grows from day to day; This year, instead of the tents, we found stately houses along a beautiful road from the Sarayah to the bed of the wadi. In the government building a garden has been laid out, and all sorts of trees have been planted which are sure to prosper, for the few shrubs planted two years ago by the steam mill at the south-east end of the road have grown considerably. The lively construction activity is also causing a lively exploitation of the ruins.

By 1907, there was a large village, military post, a residence for the &quot;kaymakam&quot; and a large mosque. The population increased from 300 to 800 between 1902 and 1911, and by 1914 there were 1,000 people living in 200 houses.

A plan for the town in the form of a grid was developed by a Swiss and a German architect and two others. The grid pattern can be seen today in Beersheba&#x27;s Old City. Most of the residents at the time were Arabs from Hebron and the Gaza area, although Jews also began settling in the city. Many Bedouin abandoned their nomadic lives and built homes in Beersheba.

===First World War and British Mandate===

During World War I, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line to Beersheba, inaugurating the station on October 30, 1915. The celebration was attended by the Ottoman army commander Jamal Pasha and other senior government officials. The train line was captured by Allied forces in 1917, towards the end of the war. Today, it forms part of the Israeli railway network.

Beersheba played an important role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in World War I. The Battle of Beersheba was part of a wider British offensive in aimed at breaking the Turkish defensive line from Gaza to Beersheba. The Ottoman army engaged in three battles with the British forces near Gaza between March 26 and November 7, 1917. Having failed in the First and Second Battles of Gaza, the British succeeded in the Third Battle of Gaza. On October 31, 1917, three months after taking Rafah, General Allenby&#x27;s troops breached the line of Turkish defense between Gaza and Beersheba. Approximately five-hundred soldiers of the Australian 4th Light Horse Regiment and the 12th Light Horse Regiment of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, led by Brigadier General William Grant, with only horses and bayonets, charged the Turkish trenches, overran them and captured the wells in what has become known as the Battle of Beersheba, called the &quot;last successful cavalry charge in British military history.&quot; On the edge of Beersheba&#x27;s Old City is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery containing the graves of Australian, New Zealand and British soldiers. The town also contains a memorial park dedicated to them.

During the Palestine Mandate, Beersheba was a major administrative center. The British constructed a railway between Rafah and Beersheba in October 1917 which opened to the public in May 1918, serving the Negev and settlements south of Mount Hebron. In 1928, at the beginning of the tension between the Jews and the Arabs over control of Palestine and wide-scale rioting which left 133 Jews dead and 339 wounded, many Jews abandoned Beersheba, although some returned occasionally. After an Arab attack on a Jewish bus in 1936, which escalated into the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, the remaining Jews left.

At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, Beersheba had a population of 2,356 (2,012 Muslims, 235 Christians, 98 Jews and 11 Druze). At the time of the 1931 census, Beersheba had 545 occupied houses and a population of 2,959 (2,791 Muslims, 152 Christians, 11 Jews and five Baháʼí). The 1938 village survey did not cover Beersheba due to the area&#x27;s largely nomadic population and the Rural Property Tax Ordinance not being applied there. The 1945 village survey conducted by the Palestine Mandate government found 5,570 (5,360 Muslims, 200 Christians and 10 others).


===1948 Palestine war===

In 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) proposed that Beersheba be included within the Jewish state in their partition plan for Palestine. However, when the UN&#x27;s Ad Hoc Committee revised the plan, they moved Beersheva to the Arab state on account of it being primarily Arab. Egyptian forces had been stationed at Beersheva since May 1948.

After the Arab states invaded Palestine and declared war on the newly-founded Jewish state of Israel, Yigal Allon proposed the conquest of Beersheba, which was approved by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, Allon ordered the &quot;conquest of Beersheba, occupation of outposts around it, [and] demolition of most of the town.&quot; The objective was to break the Egyptian blockade of Israeli convoys to the Negev. The Egyptian army did not expect an offensive and fled en masse. Israel bombed the town on October 16. At 4:00 am on October 21, the 8th Brigade&#x27;s 89th battalion and the Negev Brigade&#x27;s 7th and 9th battalions moved in. Some troops advanced from the Mishmar HaNegev junction, north of Beersheba and others from the Turkish train station and Hatzerim. By 9:45, Beersheba was in Israeli hands. Around 120 Egyptian soldiers were taken prisoner. All of the Arab inhabitants who had resisted were expelled. The remaining Arab civilians, 200 men and 150 women and children, were taken to the police fort and, on October 25, the women, children, disabled and elderly were driven by truck to the Gaza border. The Egyptian soldiers were interned in POW camps. Some men lived in the local mosque and were put to work cleaning, however, when it was discovered that they were supplying information to the Egyptian army, they were also deported. The town was subject to large-scale looting by the Haganah, and by December, in one calculation, the total number of Arabs driven out from Beersheva and surrounding areas reached 30,000 with many ending up in Jordan as refugees. Following Operation Yoav, a 10-kilometer radius exclusion zone around Beersheba was enforced into which no Bedouin were allowed. In response, the United Nations Security Council passed two resolutions on the November 4 and 16 demanding that Israel withdraw from the area.

===Israel===
====First four decades====
Following the conclusion of the war, the 1949 Armistice Agreements formally granted Beersheba to Israel. The town was then transformed into an Israeli city with only an exiguous Arab minority. Beersheba was deemed strategically important due to its location with a reliable water supply and at a major crossroads, northeast to Hebron and Jerusalem, east to the Dead Sea and al Karak, south to Aqaba, west to Gaza and southwest to Al-Auja and the border with Egypt.

After a few months, the town&#x27;s war-damaged houses were repaired. As a post-independence wave of Jewish immigration to Israel began, Beersheba experienced a population boom as thousands of immigrants moved in. The city rapidly expanded beyond its core, which became known as the &quot;Old City&quot;, as new neighborhoods were built around it, complete with various housing projects such as apartment buildings and houses with auxiliary farms, as well as shopping centers and schools. The Old City was turned into a city center, with shops, restaurants, and government and utility offices. An industrial area and one of the largest cinemas in Israel were also built in the city. By 1956, Beersheba was a booming city of 22,000. In 1959, during the Wadi Salib riots, riots spread quickly to other parts of the country, including Beersheba.

Soroka Hospital opened its doors in 1960. By 1968, the population had grown to 80,000. The University of the Negev, which would later become Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, was established in 1969. The then Egyptian president Anwar Sadat visited Beersheba in 1979. In 1983, its population was more than 110,000. During the 1990s post-Soviet aliyah, the city&#x27;s population greatly increased as many immigrants from the former Soviet Union settled there.

====Urban development in the 21st century====

As part of its Blueprint Negev project, the Jewish National Fund funded major redevelopment projects in Beersheba. One such project is the Beersheba River Walk, a riverfront park stretching along 8 kilometers of the riverside and containing a manmade boating lake, a 12,000-seat amphitheater, green spaces, playgrounds, and a bridge along the route of the city&#x27;s Mekorot water pipes. The Beersheba River had previously been used as a dumping site and filled with untreated wastewater. After the renovation, the river was transformed and now flows with high-quality purified wastewater. At the official entrance to the river park is the Beit Eshel Park, which consists of a park built around a courtyard with historic remains from the settlement of Beit Eshel.


Four new shopping malls were also built. Among them is Kanyon Beersheba, a ecologically planned mall with pools for collecting rainwater and lighting generated by solar panels on the roof. It will be situated next to an 8,000-meter park with bicycle paths. In addition, the first ever farmer&#x27;s market in Israel was established as an enclosed, circular complex with 400 spaces for vendors surrounded by parks and greenery.

A new central bus station was built in the city. The station has a glass-enclosed complex also containing shops and cafés.

Some $10.5 million was also invested in renovating Beersheba&#x27;s Old City, preserving historical buildings and upgrading infrastructure. The Turkish Quarter was also redeveloped with newly cobbled streets, widened sidewalks, and the restoration of Turkish homes into areas for dining and shopping.

In 2011, city hall announced plans to turn Beersheba into the &quot;water city&quot; of Israel. One of the projects, &quot;Beersheva beach&quot;, is a 7-dunam fountain opposite city hall. Other projects included fountains near the Soroka Medical Center and in front of the Shamoon College of Engineering.

In the 1990s, as skyscrapers began to appear in Israel, the construction of high-rise buildings began in Beersheba. Today, downtown Beersheba has been described as a &quot;clean, compact, and somewhat sterile-looking collection of high-rise office and residential towers.&quot; The city&#x27;s tallest building is Rambam Square 2, a 32-story apartment building. Many additional high-rise buildings are planned or are under construction, including skyscrapers. There are further plans to build luxury residential towers in the city.

In December 2012, a plan to build 16,000 new housing units in the Ramot Gimel neighborhood was scrapped in favor of creating a new urban forest, which spans and serves as the area&#x27;s &quot;green lung&quot;, as part of the plans to develop a &quot;green band&quot; around the city. The forest includes designated picnic areas, biking trails, and walking trails. According to Mayor Ruvik Danilovich, Beersheba still has an abundance of open, underdeveloped spaces that can be used for urban development.

In 2017, a new urban building plan was approved for the city, designed to raise the city&#x27;s population to 340,000 by 2030. Under the plan, 13,000 more housing units will be built, along with industrial and business developments occupying a total of four million square meters. A second public hospital is also planned. Planning for the Beersheba Light Rail also began. In 2019, the construction of a new public hospital, which will be named after Shimon Peres, was approved. The hospital will be a complex that will feature 1,900 beds, commerce, hotel, alternative medicine, and paramedical services, and research centers, with the possibility of apartment units for medical faculty employees, students, and senior housing. It will be linked to the rest of the city by a light rail system.

In 2021, an outline plan was approved for the construction of 34,000 housing units in the city to increase the population to 400,000, as well as the construction of 4 million square meters of office and commercial space, 3 million square meters of industrial space, 2.7 million square meters of space in public buildings, and 370,000 square meters of space for the tourism industry. One of the primary goals of the plan is to boost connections between neighborhoods through a continuous network of streets which will be shaded and give preference to public transport and pedestrians. Under the plan, construction in the city center will be boosted and Rager Boulevard, which the plan identifies as the city&#x27;s main avenue, will be turned from a multi-lane road into an urban avenue with expanded residential construction alongside it.

====Security incidents in the city====
On October 19, 1998, sixty-four people were wounded in a grenade attack.
On August 31, 2004, sixteen people were killed in two suicide bombings on commuter buses in Beersheba for which Hamas claimed responsibility. On August 28, 2005, another suicide bomber attacked the central bus station, seriously injuring two security guards and 45 bystanders. During Operation Cast Lead, which began on December 27, 2008, and lasted until the ceasefire on January 18, 2009, Hamas fired 2,378 rockets (such as Grad rockets) and mortars, from Gaza into southern Israel, including Beersheba. The rocket attacks have continued, but have been only partially effective since the introduction of the Iron Dome rocket defense system.

In 2010, an Arab attacked and injured two people with an axe. In 2012, a Palestinian from Jenin was stopped before a stabbing attack in a &quot;safe house&quot;. On October 18, 2015, a lone gunman shot and killed a soldier guarding the Beersheva bus station before being gunned down by police. In September 2016, the Shin Bet thwarted a Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror attack at a wedding hall in Beersheba.

On March 22, 2022, a convicted Islamic State supporter carried out a stabbing and vehicle-ramming attack, killing four people and injuring two others.

During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the city became the target of several rocket attacks.

==Emblem of Beersheba==

Since 1950, Beersheba has changed its municipal emblem several times.
The 1950 emblem, designed by Abraham Khalili, featured a tamarix tree, a factory and water flowing from a pipeline. In 1972, the emblem was modernized with the symbolic representation of the Twelve Tribes and a tower. Words from the Bible are inscribed: Abraham &quot;planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba.&quot; (Genesis 21:33) Since 2012, it has incorporated the number seven as part of the city rebranding.

==Geography==

Beersheba is located on the northern edge of the Negev desert south-east of Tel Aviv and south-west of Jerusalem. The city is located on the main route from the center and north of the country to Eilat in the far south. The Beersheba Valley has been populated for thousands of years, as it has available water, which flows from the Hebron hills in the winter and is stored underground in vast quantities. The main river in Beersheba is &quot;Nahal Beersheva&quot;, a stream that flows year round and occasionally floods in the winter. The Kovshim and Katef streams are other important wadis that pass through the city. Beersheba is surrounded by several satellite towns, including Omer, Lehavim, and Meitar, and the Bedouin localities of Rahat, Tel as-Sabi, and Lakiya. Just northwest of the city (near Ramot neighborhood) is a region called Goral hills (heb:גבעות גורל lit: hills of fate), the area has hills with up to above sea level and low as above sea level. Due to heavy construction the flora unique to the area is endangered.
Northeast of the city (north to the Neve Menahem neighborhood) there are Loess plains and dry river bands.

===Climate===
Beersheba has a hot arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) bordering upon a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) though with Mediterranean influences. The city has characteristics of both Mediterranean and desert climates. Summers are hot and dry, and winters are mild. Rainfall is highly concentrated in the winter season. In summer, the temperatures are high in daytime and nighttime with an average high of and an average low of . Winters have an average high of and average low of . Snow is very rare; a snowfall on February 20, 2015, was the first such occurrence in the city since 2000.

Precipitation in summer is rare, most rainfalls come in winter between September and May, but the annual amount is low, averaging per year. There are sandstorms in summer. Haze and fog are common in winter, as a result of high humidity.


==Demographics==
Beersheba is one of the fastest-growing cities in Israel. Though it has a population of about 200,000, the city is larger in area than Tel Aviv, and its urban plan calls for an eventual population of 450,000–500,000. It is planned to have a population of 340,000 by 2030. The population of Beersheba is predominantly Jewish. Jews and others represent 97.3% of the population, of whom Jews are 86.5%. Arabs constitute around 2.69% of city population.
The Israel Central Bureau of Statistics divides the Beersheba metropolitan area into two areas: 
==Economy==

The largest employers in Beersheba are Soroka Medical Center, the municipality, Israel Defense Forces and Ben-Gurion University. A major Israel Aerospace Industries complex is located in the main industrial zone, north of Highway 60. Numerous electronics and chemical plants, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, are located in and around the city.

Beersheba is emerging as a high-tech center, with an emphasis on cyber security. A large high-tech park was built near the Be&#x27;er Sheva North Railway Station in 2012 and a fifth commercial building begun to be constructed. Deutsche Telekom, Elbit Systems, EMC, Lockheed Martin, Ness Technologies, WeWork and RAD Data Communications have opened facilities there, as has a cyberincubator run by Jerusalem Venture Partners. A Science park funded by the RASHI-SACTA Foundation, Beersheba Municipality and private donors was completed in 2008. Another high-tech park is located north of the city near Omer.

An additional three industrial zones are located on the southeastern side of the city – Makhteshim, Emek Sara and Kiryat Yehudit – and a light industry zone between Kiryat Yehudit and the Old City.

==Local government==
The mayor of Beersheba is Ruvik Danilovich, who was deputy mayor under Yaakov Turner.
==Educational institutions==

According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2022, Beersheba has a ca.8,975 preschoolers in ca.300 preschools &amp; kindergartens. A total of 99 schools teaching a student population of ca.45,291: 60 elementary schools with an enrollment of 19,617 (ca.3,200 of whom are entering the 1st grade), and 39 high schools with an enrollment of 16,699. Of Beersheba&#x27;s 12th graders, 90% earned a Bagrut matriculation certificate in 2022. The city also has several private schools and yeshivot in the religious sector with 3,000 or more students.

Beersheba is home to one of Israel&#x27;s major universities, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, located on an urban campus in the city (Dalet neighborhood). Other schools in Beersheva are the Open University of Israel, Shamoon College of Engineering (SCE), Kaye Academic College of Education, Practical Engineering College of Beersheba (), and a campus of the Israeli Air and Space College (&quot;Techni Be&#x27;er sheva &quot;).

==Neighborhoods==

After Israeli independence, Beersheba became a &quot;laboratory&quot; for Israeli architecture. &quot;Mishol Girit,&quot; a neighborhood built in the late 1950s, was the first attempt to create an alternative to the standard public housing projects in Israel. &quot;Hashatiah&quot; (literally, &quot;the carpet&quot;), also known as (the model neighborhood), was hailed by architects around the world. Today, Beersheba is divided into seventeen residential neighborhoods in addition to the Old City and Ramot, an umbrella neighborhood of four sub-districts. Many of the neighbourhoods are named after letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which also have numerical value, but descriptive place names have been given to some of the newer neighborhoods.

==Art and cultural institutions==

In 1953, Cinema Keren, the Negev&#x27;s first movie theater, opened in Beersheba. It was built by the Histadrut and had seating for 1,200 people.
Beersheba is the home base of the Israel Sinfonietta, founded in 1973. Over the years, the Sinfonietta has developed a broad repertoire of symphonic works, concerti for solo instruments and large choral productions, among them Handel&#x27;s &quot;Israel in Egypt,&quot; masses by Schubert and Mozart, Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; and Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot;. World-famous artists have appeared as soloists with the Sinfonietta, including Pinchas Zukerman, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Shlomo Mintz, Gary Karr, and Paul Tortelier. In the 1970s, a memorial commemorating fallen Israeli soldiers designed by the sculptor Danny Karavan was erected on a hill north-east of the city. The Beersheba Theater opened in 1973. The Light Opera Group of the Negev, established in 1980, performs musicals in English every year.

Landmarks in the city include &quot;Abraham&#x27;s well&quot;, a well dating to at least the 12th century CE (now inside a visitors center), and the old Turkish railway station, now the focus of development plans. The Artists House of the Negev, in a Mandate-era building, showcases artwork connected in some way to the Negev.

The Negev Museum of Art reopened in 2004 in the Ottoman Governor&#x27;s House, and an art and media center for young people was established in the Old City.

In 2009, a new tourist and information center, Gateway to the Negev, was built.

===Great Mosque of Beersheba===

In 1906, during the Ottoman era, the Great Mosque of Beersheba was built with donations collected from the Bedouin residents in the Negev. It was used actively as a mosque until the city fell to Israeli forces in 1948. The mosque was used until 1953 as the city&#x27;s courthouse. From then until the 1990s, when it was closed for renovations, the building housed an archeological museum, which the city intended to turn into the archeological branch of the Negev Museum. In 2011, however, the Supreme Court of Israel, sitting as the High Court of Justice, ordered the property to be turned into a museum of Islam without reverting to a place of worship.

==Transportation==

Beersheba is the central transport hub of southern Israel, served by roads, railways and air. Beersheba is connected to Tel Aviv via Highway 40, the second longest highway in Israel, which passes to the east of the city and is called the Beersheba bypass because it allows travellers from the north to go to southern locations, avoiding the more congested city center. From west to east, the city is divided by Highway 25, which connects to Ashkelon and the Gaza Strip to the northwest, and Dimona to the east. Finally, Highway 60 connects Beersheba with Jerusalem and the Shoket Junction, and goes through the West Bank. On the local level, a partial ring road surrounds the city from the north and east, and Road 406 (Rager Blvd.) goes through the city center from north to south.

Metrodan Beersheba, established in 2003, had a fleet of 90 buses and operates 19 lines in the city between 2003 and 2016, most of which depart from the Beersheba Central Bus Station. These lines were formerly operated by the municipality as the &#x27;Be&#x27;er Sheva Urban Bus Services&#x27;. Inter-city buses to and from Beersheba are operated by Egged, Dan BaDarom and Metropoline. The intercity bus service was transferred to Dan Be&#x27;er Sheva in 25&#x27;th of November 2016 and Metrodan Beersheva had been shut down. With the change to Dan Be&#x27;er Sheva the company introduced electronic payment stopping pay at the driver which was common in Beersheba.
Israel Railways operates two stations in the city that form part of the railway to Beersheba: the old Be&#x27;er Sheva North University station, adjacent to Ben Gurion University and Soroka Medical Center, and the new Be&#x27;er Sheva Central station, adjacent to the central bus station. Between the two stations, the railway splits into two, and also continues to Dimona and the Dead Sea factories. An extension is planned to Eilat and Arad.

The Be&#x27;er Sheva North University station is the terminus of the line to Dimona. All stations of Israel Railways can be accessed from Beersheba using transfer stations in Tel Aviv and Lod. Until 2012, the railway line to Beersheba used a slow single-track configuration with sharp curves and many level crossings which limited train speed. Between 2004 and 2012 the line was double tracked and rebuilt using an improved alignment and all its level crossings were grade separated. The rebuilding effort cost NIS 2.8 billion and significantly reduced the travel time and greatly increased the train frequency to and from Tel Aviv and Kiryat Motzkin to Beersheba. In addition, Beersheba will be linked to Tel Aviv and Eilat by a new passenger and freight high-speed railway system.

The Beersheba Light Rail is currently planned as a light rail system for the city of Beersheba and outlying communities. There have been plans for a light rail system in Beersheba for many years, and a light rail system appears in the master plan for the city. An agreement was signed for the construction of a light rail system in 1998, but was not implemented. In 2008, the Israeli Finance Ministry contemplated freezing the Tel Aviv Light Rail project and building a light rail system in Beersheba instead, but that did not happen. In 2014, mayor Ruvik Danilovich announced that the light rail system will be built in the city. In 2017, the Ministry of Transport gave the Beersheba municipality approval to proceed with preliminary planning on a light rail system. In August 2023, the light rail was officially approved. It is expected to be completed by 2033.

===Roundabouts===

In Be&#x27;er Sheva, there are over 250 roundabouts, giving the city its nickname of &quot;Roundabout Capital of Israel&quot;. Many roundabouts, part of Be&#x27;er-Sheva&#x27;s urban oasis project, include fountains, landscaping and sculptures by well-known artists (such as Menashe Kadishman&#x27;s The Horse Circle and Jeremy Langford&#x27;s The Drip Circle). Some commemorate famous people and international and local organizations, or mark important events. Some are named after the twin cities of Beer Sheva.

Well-known roundabouts are: Ilan Ramon Circle, Phantom Circle near the Air Force Technical School, Champions Square near Turner Stadium and Conch Arena, Chess Circle, Harp Circle near the Municipal Conservatory and the Be&#x27;er-Sheva Performing Arts Center, College Circle, Ben Gurion Circle, Light Circle, Freemasons Circle, Shofarot Circle, Twin Towers Circle.

===Hiking===
Beersheba is linked to &quot;Hilvan&quot; by the Abraham Path.

==Sports==
Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva plays in the Israeli Premier League, the top tier of Israeli football, having been promoted in the 2008–2009 Liga Leumit season. The club has won the Israeli championship five times, in 1975, 1976, 2016, 2017 and 2018, as well as the State Cup in 1997, 2020 and 2022. Beersheba has two other local clubs, Maccabi Be&#x27;er Sheva (based in Neve Noy) and F.C. Be&#x27;er Sheva (based in the north of Dalet), a continuation of the defunct Beitar Avraham Be&#x27;er Sheva. Hapoel play at the Turner Stadium.

Beersheba has a basketball club, Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva. The team plays at The Conch Arena, which seats 3,000.

Beersheba has become Israel&#x27;s national chess center; thanks to Soviet immigration, it is home to the largest number of chess grandmasters of any city in the world. The city hosted the World Team Chess Championship in 2005, and chess is taught in the city&#x27;s kindergartens. The Israeli chess team won the silver medal at the 2008 Chess Olympiad and the bronze at the 2010 Olympiad. The chess club was founded in 1973 by Eliyahu Levant, who served as its director for the next 40 years.

The city has the second largest wrestling center (AMI wrestling school) in Israel. The center is run by Leonid Shulman and has approximately 2,000 students, most of whom are from Russian immigrant families since the origins of the club are in the Nahal Beka immigrant absorption center. Maccabi Be&#x27;er Sheva has a freestyle wrestling team, whilst Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva has a Greco-Roman wrestling team. In the 2010 World Wrestling Championships, AMI students won five medals. Cricket is played under the auspices of Israel Cricket Association. Beersheba is also home to a rugby team, whose senior and youth squads have won several national titles (including the recent Senior National League 2004–2005 championship). Beersheba&#x27;s tennis center, which opened in 1991, features eight lighted courts, and the Beersheba (Teyman) airfield is used for gliding.

==Environmental awards==
In 2012, the Beersheba &quot;ring trail&quot;, a 42-kilometer hiking trail around the city, won third place in the annual environmental competition of the European Travelers Association.

<text>Dominicans () also known as Quisqueyans () are an ethno-national people, a people of shared ancestry and culture, who have ancestral roots in the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican ethnic group was born out of a fusion of European (mainly Spanish), native Taino, and African elements, this is a fusion that goes as far back as the 1500s. Due to this fusion, all Dominicans are of mixed-race heritage, tracing roots mainly to these three sources, the vast majority being evenly mixed, and smaller numbers being predominantly European or African. The demonym Dominican is derived from &quot;Santo Domingo&quot; (Spanish equivalent Saint Dominic) and directly inherited from the name of the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo, which was synonymous with the island of Hispaniola as a whole and centered in the city of Santo Domingo, the capital of modern Dominican Republic. Recent immigrants and their children, who are legal citizens of the Dominican Republic, can be considered &quot;Dominican&quot; by nationality but not ethnicity due to not having ancestral roots in the country.

&quot;Dominican&quot; was historically the name for the inhabitants of the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo, the site of the first Spanish settlement in the Western Hemisphere. Majority of Dominicans primarily trace their origin to the Captaincy General&#x27;s European settlers, with native Taino and African influences.

The majority of Dominicans reside in the Dominican Republic, while there is also a large Dominican diaspora, mainly in the United States and Spain. The total population of the Dominican Republic in 2016 was estimated by the National Bureau of Statistics of the Dominican Republic at 10.2 million, with 9.3 million of those being natives of the country, and the rest being of foreign origin.

==Name==
Historically the Dominican Republic was known as Santo Domingo, the name of its present capital and its patron saint, Saint Dominic. Hence the residents were called &quot;Dominicanos&quot; (Dominicans). The revolutionaries named their newly independent country &quot;La República Dominicana&quot;. It was often referred to as the &quot;Republic of San Domingo&quot; in English language 19th century publications.

==History==
=== Pre-European history ===
Prior to European colonization, the inhabitants of the island were the Arawakan-speaking Taíno, a seafaring people who moved into Hispaniola from the north-east region of South America, displacing earlier inhabitants, c. AD 650. The native Tainos divided the island into several chiefdoms and engaged in farming, fishing, as well as hunting, and gathering.

The Spaniards arrived in 1492. Columbus and his crew were the first recorded Europeans to encounter the Taíno people. Columbus described the native Taínos as a physically tall and well-proportioned people, with a noble character. After initially amicable relationships, the Taínos fought against the conquest, led by the female Chief Anacaona of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief Caonabo of Maguana, as well as Chiefs Guacanagaríx, Guamá, Hatuey, and Enriquillo. The latter&#x27;s successes gained his people an autonomous enclave for a time on the island. Within a few years after the 1492 arrival, the population of Taínos had declined drastically, due to smallpox, measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans. Census records from 1514 reveal that at least 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taino women, and many present-day Dominicans have significant Taíno ancestry.

=== European colonization ===
Christopher Columbus arrived on the island in December 5, 1492, during the first of his four voyages to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it &quot;La Española&quot; due to its diverse climate and terrain which reminded him of the Spanish landscape. In 1496, Bartholomew Columbus, Christopher&#x27;s brother, built the city of Santo Domingo, Western Europe&#x27;s first permanent colonization in the &quot;New World.&quot; The colony thus became the springboard for the further Spanish conquest of America and for decades the headquarters of Spanish colonial power in the hemisphere.

In 1501, the colony began to import African slaves. In 1697, after decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to France with the Treaty of Ryswick, whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain.

By the middle of the 18th century, the population was bolstered by European emigration from the Canary Islands, resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the Cibao Valley, and importation of slaves was renewed. After 1700, with the arrival of new Spanish colonists, the African holocaust resumed. However, as industry moved from sugar to cattle ranching, racial and caste divisions became less important, eventually leading to a blend of cultures—Spanish, African, and indigenous—which would form the basis of national identity for Dominicans. It is estimated that the population of the colony in 1777 was 400,000, of which 100,000 were European, 70,000 African, 100,000 European/indigenous mestizo, 60,000 African/indigenous mestizo, and 70,000 African/European.

Dominican privateers in the service of the Spanish Crown captured British, Dutch, French and Danish ships in the Caribbean Sea throughout the 18th century.

=== Independence ===

Santo Domingo attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844 from the Haitian government. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo from 1930 to 1961.
Trujillo&#x27;s regime carried out killings of thousands of Haitians and committed crimes in the United States, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Raids on the national treasury enabled Trujillo to amass a net worth of 800 million dollars (5.3 billion dollars today). It has been estimated that Trujillo&#x27;s tyrannical rule was responsible for the death of more than 50,000 Dominicans. The Dominican Civil War of 1965 was ended by a United States-led intervention, and was followed by the authoritarian rule of Joaquín Balaguer, the leader from 1966 to 1978. Since that time, the Dominican Republic has moved steadily toward representative democracy.

==Genetics and ethnicities==
According to recent genealogical DNA studies of the Dominican population, the genetic makeup is predominantly European and Sub-Saharan African, with a lesser degree of Native American ancestry. The average DNA admixture of the founder Dominican population was 73% European, 10% Native, and 17% African, but due to the migration from Haiti and other Afro-Caribbean countries, the current overall admixture is 50%-60% European, 8%-12% Native and 30%-40% African.
===2022 census===
Responses for the 2022 census population of 12 years old and above.
National Statistics Office.


A previous survey published in 2021, shows similar results with 74% of Dominicans self-identified as mixed (&quot;Indio&quot; 45%, mulatto/&quot;moreno&quot; 25%, mestizo/&quot;jabao&quot; 2%), 18% as white, 8% black, and 0.5% as &quot;other&quot;.
Previously, in the 1996 electoral roll, 82.5% of the adult population were &quot;Indio&quot;, 7.55% white, 4.13% black, and 2.3% mulatto. Other estimates puts the Dominican population at 60% mixed, 35% black, and 5% white.

Other groups in the country include the descendants of West Asians—mostly Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians. A smaller, yet significant presence of East Asians (primarily ethnic Chinese and Japanese) can also be found throughout the population. Dominicans are also composed of Sephardic Jews that were exiled from Spain and the Mediterranean area in 1492 and 1497, coupled with other migrations dating to the 1700s and during the Second World War contribute to Dominican ancestry.

In recent times, Dominican and Puerto Rican researchers identified in the current Dominican population the presence of genes belonging to the aborigines of the Canary Islands (commonly called Guanches). These types of genes have also been detected in Puerto Rico.

===In Dominican Republic===
Dominican Republic employs the jus sanguinis nationality law principle, unlike majority of other countries in the Americas. Therefore, citizenship is inherited through at least one parent or legal guardian who is a Dominican citizens or alternatively by invoking and proving one&#x27;s ancestral link to the country. This means that being a &quot;Dominican citizen&quot; and being an &quot;ethnic Dominican&quot; is not always interchangeable, as the former implies citizenship that one can receive moving from any country in the world to Dominican Republic, while the latter implies a people tied by ancestry and culture. Ethnic Dominicans are people who are not only born in Dominican Republic (and have legal status) or born abroad with ancestral roots in the country, but more importantly have family roots in the country going back several generations and descend from a mix of varying degrees of Spanish, Taino, and African, the three principal foundational roots of Dominican Republic. Nearly all Dominicans are mixed race, with 75% being &quot;visibly&quot; and &quot;evenly&quot; mixed, and the remaining 25% being predominantly of African or European blood but still with notable admixture. According to a 2017 estimate from the Dominican government, Dominican Republic had a population of 10,189,895, of which 847,979 were immigrants or descendants of recent immigrants and 9,341,916 were &quot;ethnic Dominicans&quot;.

==Immigration in the 20th and 21st centuries==
In the twentieth century, many Chinese, Arabs (primarily from Lebanon and Syria), Japanese and to a lesser degree Koreans settled in the country, working as agricultural laborers and merchants. Waves of Chinese immigrants, the latter ones fleeing the Chinese Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), arrived and worked in mines and building railroads. The current Chinese Dominican population totals 50,000 (2010 year). The Arab community is also rising at an increasing rate.
In addition, there are descendants of immigrants who came from other Caribbean islands, including Saint Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, Antigua, St. Vincent, Montserrat, Tortola, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks and settled mainly in the cities of San Pedro de Macorís and Puerto Plata, they have a population of 28,000. There is an increasing number of Puerto Rican immigrants in and around Santo Domingo; they are believed to number at about 10,000. Before and during World War II 800 Jewish refugees moved to the Dominican Republic, and many of their descendants live in the town of Sosúa. Nationwide, there are an estimated 100 Jews left. 82,000 Americans (in 1999), 40,000 Italians, 1,900 French, and 800 Germans.

The 2010 Census registered 311,969 Haitians; 24,457 Americans; 6,691 Spaniards; 5,763 Puerto Ricans; and 5,132 Venezuelans.

In 2012, the Dominican government made a survey of immigrants in the country and found that there were: 329,281 Haitian-born; 25,814 U. S.-born (excluding Puerto Rican-born); 7,062 Spanish-born; 6,083 Puerto Rican-born; 5,417 Venezuelan-born; 3,841 Cuban-born; 3,795 Italian-born; 3,606 Colombian-born; 2,043 French-born; 1,661 German-born; 1,484 Chinese-born; among others.

In the second half of 2017, a second survey of foreign population was conducted in the Dominican Republic. The total population in the Dominican Republic was estimated at 10,189,895, of which 9,341,916 were Dominicans with no foreign background. According to the survey, the majority of the people with foreign background were of Haitian origin (751,080 out of 847,979, or 88.6%), breaking down as follows: 497,825 were Haitians born in Haiti, 171,859 Haitians born in the Dominican Republic and 81,590 Dominicans with a Haitian parent. Other main sources of foreign-born population were Venezuela (25,872), the United States (10,016), Spain (7,592), Italy (3,713), China (3,069), Colombia (2,642), Puerto Rico (2,356), and Cuba (2,024).

==Emigration==
===United States===

The first recorded person of Dominican descent to migrate to what is now known as the United States was sailor-turned-merchant Juan Rodriguez. He arrived on Manhattan in 1613 from his home in Santo Domingo, which makes him the first non-Native American person to spend substantial time in the island. He also became the first Dominican, the first Latino, first Caribbean and the first person with European (specifically Portuguese) and African ancestry to settle in what is present day New York City.

Dominican emigration to the United States continued throughout the centuries. Recent research from the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute has documented some 5,000 Dominican emigrants who were processed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924.

During the second half of the twentieth century, there were three significant waves of immigration to the United States. The first period began in 1961, when a coalition of high-ranking Dominicans, with assistance from the CIA, assassinated General Rafael Trujillo, the nation&#x27;s military dictator. In the wake of his death, fear of retaliation by Trujillo&#x27;s allies, and political uncertainty in general, spurred migration from the island. In 1965, the United States began a military occupation of the Dominican Republic and eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain American visas. From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network that assisted subsequent arrivals. In the early 1980s, unemployment, inflation, and the rise in the value of the dollar all contributed to the third and largest wave of emigration from the island nation, this time mostly from the lower-class. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high, facilitated by the social networks of now-established Dominican communities in the United States.

Besides the United States, significant numbers of Dominicans have also settled in Spain and in the nearby U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.

===Dominican Emigration===
===Dominican Immigration===
==Culture==

The culture of the Dominican Republic, like its Caribbean neighbors, is a blend of the cultures of the European settlers, African slaves and settlers, and Taíno natives. Spanish is the official language. Other languages, such as English, French, German, Italian, and Chinese are also spoken to varying degrees. European, African, and Taíno cultural elements are most prominent in food, family structure, religion, and music. Many Arawak/Taíno names and words are used in daily conversation and for many foods native to the Dominican Republic.

===National symbols===
Some of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s important symbols are the flag, the coat of arms, and the national anthem, titled &quot;Himno Nacional&quot;. The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God&#x27;s protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.

In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military. A blue ribbon above the shield reads, &quot;Dios, Patria, Libertad&quot; (meaning &quot;God, Fatherland, Liberty&quot;). A red ribbon under the shield reads, &quot;República Dominicana&quot; (meaning &quot;Dominican Republic&quot;). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.

The national flower is the Bayahibe Rose and the national tree is the West Indian Mahogany. The national bird is the &quot;Cigua Palmera&quot; or Palmchat (&quot;Dulus dominicus&quot;).

===Language===
Spanish is the predominant language in the Dominican Republic; the local dialect is called Dominican Spanish, it closely resembles Canarian Spanish, Andalusian Spanish, and has influences from Arawak languages. Schools are based on a Spanish educational model, with English and French being taught as secondary languages in both private and public schools. Haitian Creole is spoken by the population of Haitian descent. There is a community of about 8,000 speakers of Samaná English in the Samaná Peninsula. They are the descendants of formerly-enslaved African Americans who arrived in the 19th century. Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of Dominican Americans, and the country&#x27;s economic ties with the United States motivate other Dominicans to learn English.

===Religion===
The Dominican Republic is 80% Christian, including 57% Roman Catholic and 23% Protestant. Recent but small scale immigration, as well as proselytizing, has brought other religions, with the following shares of the population: Spiritist: 1.2%, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: 1.1%, Buddhist: 0.10%, Baháʼí: 0.1%, Islam: 0.02%, Judaism: 0.01%, Chinese folk religion: 0.1%.

Roman Catholicism was introduced by Columbus and Spanish missionaries. Religion was not really the foundation of their entire society, as it was in other parts of the world at the time, and most of the population did not attend church on a regular basis. Nonetheless, most of the education in the country was based upon the Catholic religion, as the Bible was required in the curricula of all public schools. Children would use religious-based dialogue when greeting a relative or parent. For example, a child would say &quot;Bless me, mother&quot;, and the mother would reply &quot;May God bless you&quot;. The nation has two patroness saints: &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia&quot; (Our Lady Of High Grace) is the patroness of the Dominican people, and &quot;Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes&quot; (Our Lady Of Mercy) is the patroness of the Dominican Republic. The Catholic Church began to lose popularity in the late nineteenth century. This was due to a lack of funding, of priests, and of support programs. During the same time, the Protestant evangelical movement began to gain support. Religious tension between Catholics and Protestants in the country has been rare.

There have always been religious freedom throughout the entire country. Not until the 1950s were restrictions placed upon churches by Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was even put into place, with his assassination.

Judaism appeared in the Dominican Republic in the late 1930s. During World War II, a group of Jews escaping Nazi Germany fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of Sosúa. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.

===Cuisine===

Dominican cuisine is predominantly made up of a combination of Spanish, Native American, and African influences over the last few centuries. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries, but many of the names of dishes are different. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and &quot;mangú&quot; (mashed, boiled plantain). For heartier versions, these are accompanied by deep-fried meat (typically Dominican salami) and/or cheese. Similarly to Spain, lunch is generally the largest and most important meal of the day. Lunch usually consists of rice, some type of meat (chicken, beef, pork, or fish), beans, plantains, and a side portion of salad. &quot;La Bandera&quot; (literally, The Flag), the most popular lunch dish, consists of meat and red beans on white rice. There is a famous soup &quot;Sancocho&quot; a typical national soup made with seven kinds of variety of meats.

Dominican cuisine usually accommodates all the food groups, incorporating meat or seafood; rice, potatoes, or plantains; and is accompanied by some other type of vegetable or salad. However, meals usually heavily favor starches and meats over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with &quot;sofrito&quot;, which is a mix of local herbs and spices sautéed to bring out all of the dish&#x27;s flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in &quot;quipes&quot; or &quot;tipili&quot; (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican dishes include &quot;chicharrón&quot;, &quot;yuca&quot;, &quot;casabe&quot;, and &quot;pastelitos&quot; (empanadas), &quot;batata&quot;, &quot;pasteles en hoja&quot;, (ground-roots pockets) &quot;chimichurris&quot;, &quot;plátanos maduros&quot; (ripe plantain), and &quot;tostones&quot;.

Some treats Dominicans enjoy are &quot;arroz con dulce&quot; (or &quot;arroz con leche&quot;), &quot;bizcocho dominicano&quot; (lit. Dominican cake), &quot;habichuelas con dulce&quot; (sweet creamed beans), flan, &quot;frío frío&quot; (snow cones), dulce de leche, and &quot;caña&quot; (sugarcane).

The beverages Dominicans enjoy include &quot;Morir Soñando&quot;, rum, beer, &quot;Mama Juana&quot;, &quot;batida&quot; (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), &quot;mabí&quot;, and coffee.

===Music and dance===
Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the creation of the musical style called &quot;merengue&quot;, a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (it varies wildly) based on musical elements like drums, brass, and chorded instruments, as well as some elements unique to the music style of the DR. It includes the use of the &quot;tambora&quot; (Dominican drum), accordion, and &quot;güira&quot;. Its syncopated beats use Latin percussion, brass instruments, bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 the merengue music was promoted internationally, by some Dominicans groups like, Billo&#x27;s Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron Los Reyes del Merengue, Joseito Mateo and others. Later on it was more popularized via television, radio and international media, well-known merengue singers include singer/songwriter Juan Luis Guerra, Fernando Villalona, Eddy Herrera, Sergio Vargas, Toño Rosario, Johnny Ventura, and Milly Quezada and Chichí Peralta. Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the East Coast, during the 1980s and 90s, when many Dominican artists, among them Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferraira, Aventura, Milly, and Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos, residing in the U.S. (particularly New York City) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. The emergence of &quot;bachata&quot;, c along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other Latino groups in New York, New Jersey, and Florida have contributed to Dominican music&#x27;s overall growth in popularity.

Bachata, a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was &quot;amargue&quot; (&quot;bitterness&quot;, or &quot;bitter music&quot;, or blues music), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term &quot;bachata&quot; became popular. Bachata grew out of and is still closely related to, the pan-Latin American romantic style called &quot;bolero&quot;. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.

Salsa music has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like Johnny Pacheco, creator of the Fania All Stars played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.

===Visual arts===

Historically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between neoclassicism and romanticism. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of realism and impressionism. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles. The artists of the times were Celeste Woss y Gil (1890–1985), Jaime Colson (1901–1975), Yoryi O. Morel (1906–1979) and Darío Suro (1917–1997).

Between 1950 and 1970 Dominican art expressed the social and political conditions of the time. A need for a renewal of the image language emerged and, as a result, paintings were created in non-figurative, abstract, geometric and cubistic styles. The most notable artists included Paul Giudicelli (1921–1965), Clara Ledesma (1924–1999), Gilberto Hernandez Ortega (1924–1979), Gaspar Mario Cruz (1925–2006), Luichy M. Richiez (1928–2000), Eligio Pichardo (1929–1984), Domingo Liz (b. 1931), Silvano Lora (1934–2003), Cándido Bidó (1936–2011) and José Ramírez Conde (1940–1987).

===Fashion===
In only seven years, the Dominican Republic&#x27;s fashion week has become the most important event of its kind in all of the Caribbean and one of the fastest-growing fashion events in the entire Latin American fashion world. The country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Diseño de Altos de Chavón, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design.

World-famous fashion designer Oscar de la Renta was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932 and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer Cristóbal Balenciaga and then worked with the house of Lanvin in Paris. Then by 1963, de la Renta had designs carrying his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles. Although he settled in New York, de la Renta also marketed his work in Latin America, where it became very popular, and remained active in his native Dominican Republic, where his charitable activities and personal achievements earned him the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit and the Order of Cristóbal Colón.

===Sports===
Baseball is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second-highest number of Major League Baseball (MLB) players. Some of these players have been regarded among the best in the game.
Historically, the Dominican Republic has been linked to MLB since Ozzie Virgil Sr. became the first Dominican to play in the league. Juan Marichal is the first Dominican-born player in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Olympic gold medalist and world champion over 400 m hurdles Félix Sánchez hails from the Dominican Republic, as does current defensive end for the San Diego Chargers (National Football League [NFL]), Luis Castillo. Castillo was the cover athlete for the Spanish language version of Madden NFL 08.

<doc id="312757" wikidata="Q626483" url="?curid=312757" title="Tron">
<text>Tron (stylized as TRON) is a 1982 American science fiction action adventure film written and directed by Steven Lisberger from a story by Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird. The film stars Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer and video game developer who is transported inside the software world of a mainframe computer where he interacts with programs in his attempt to escape. It also stars Bruce Boxleitner, David Warner, Cindy Morgan, and Barnard Hughes. &quot;Tron&quot;, along with &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot;, was one of cinema&#x27;s earliest films to use extensive computer-generated imagery (CGI).

The inspiration for &quot;Tron&quot; dates back to 1976, when Lisberger became intrigued with video games after seeing &quot;Pong&quot;. He and producer Donald Kushner set up an animation studio to develop &quot;Tron&quot; with the intention of making it an animated film. To promote the studio itself, Lisberger and his team created a 30-second animation featuring the first appearance of the title character. Eventually, Lisberger decided to include live-action elements with both backlit and computer animation for the actual feature-length film. Various studios had rejected the storyboards for the film before Walt Disney Productions agreed to finance and distribute &quot;Tron&quot;. There, backlit animation was finally combined with the 2D computer animation and the live action.

&quot;Tron&quot; was released on July 9, 1982. The film was a moderate success at the box office, and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its groundbreaking visuals and acting but criticized its storyline as being incoherent. &quot;Tron&quot; received nominations for Best Costume Design and Best Sound at the 55th Academy Awards. It was however disqualified from the Best Visual Effects category because at the time the Academy felt that using computer animation was &quot;cheating&quot;. &quot;Tron&quot; spawned multiple video games (including an arcade tie-in released shortly after the film), and as it became a cult film, a multimedia franchise including comic books. A sequel titled &quot;&quot;, directed by Joseph Kosinski, was released in 2010, with Bridges and Boxleitner reprising their roles and Lisberger acting as producer. A commercial success, it was followed by the XD animated series &quot;&quot; in 2012, set between the two films. A third installment, &quot;&quot;, is scheduled to be released on October 10, 2025.

== Plot ==

Kevin Flynn is a leading software engineer, formerly employed by large technology corporation ENCOM. He now runs a video game arcade, and attempts to hack into ENCOM&#x27;s system with a program called CLU. However, ENCOM&#x27;s Master Control Program (MCP) halts his progress and CLU is deleted. Within ENCOM, programmer Alan Bradley and his girlfriend, engineer Lora Baines, discover that the MCP has closed off their access to projects. When Alan confronts the senior executive vice president, Ed Dillinger, he asserts the security measures are an effort to stop outside hacking attempts. However, when Dillinger privately questions the MCP through his computerized desk, he realizes the MCP has expanded into a powerful virtual intelligence and has been illegally appropriating personal, business, and government programs to increase its own capabilities. As Dillinger rose to the top of ENCOM by presenting Flynn&#x27;s games as his own, the MCP blackmails Dillinger by threatening to expose his plagiarism if he does not comply with its directives.

Lora deduces that Flynn is the hacker, and she and Alan go to his arcade to warn him. Flynn reveals that he has been trying to locate evidence proving Dillinger&#x27;s plagiarism. Together, the three form a plan to break into ENCOM and unlock Alan&#x27;s &quot;Tron&quot; program, a self-governing security measure designed to protect the system and counter the functions of the MCP. Once inside ENCOM, the three split up, and Flynn comes into direct conflict with the MCP through a laboratory terminal. Before Flynn can get the information he needs, the MCP uses an experimental laser to digitize and upload him into the ENCOM gaming grid. There, computer programs are living entities appearing in the likeness of the human &quot;Users&quot; (programmers) who created them. The space is ruled by the MCP and its second-in-command, Sark, who coerce programs to renounce their belief in the Users and force those who resist to compete in deadly games.

Flynn is put into the games and plays well; between matches, he befriends two other captured programs, Ram and Tron. The three escape into the system during a round of &quot;Light Cycle&quot; (an arcade game Flynn created and is skilled at), but Flynn and Ram become separated from Tron by an MCP pursuit party. While attempting to help a badly injured Ram, Flynn learns that he can manipulate portions of the system by accessing his programmer knowledge. Just before Ram &quot;derezzes&quot; (dies), he recognizes Flynn as a User, and encourages him to find Tron and free the system. Using his newfound ability, Flynn rebuilds a broken vehicle and disguises himself as one of Sark&#x27;s soldiers.

Tron enlists help from Yori, a sympathetic program, and at an I/O tower receives information from Alan necessary to destroy the MCP. Flynn rejoins them, and the three board a hijacked solar sailer to reach the MCP&#x27;s core. However, Sark&#x27;s command ship destroys the sailer, capturing Flynn and Yori and presumably killing Tron. Sark leaves the command ship and orders its deresolution, but Flynn keeps it intact by manipulating the system again.

Sark reaches the MCP&#x27;s core on a shuttle carrying captured programs deemed powerful or useful. While the MCP attempts to absorb these programs, Tron, who is still alive, confronts Sark and critically injures him, prompting the MCP to give Sark all its functions. Realizing that his ability to manipulate the system might give Tron an opening, Flynn leaps into the beam of the MCP, distracting it. Seeing a break in the MCP&#x27;s shield, Tron attacks through the gap and destroys the MCP and Sark, ending the MCP&#x27;s control over the system and allowing the captured programs to communicate with users again.

Flynn reappears in the real world, rematerialized at the terminal. Tron&#x27;s victory in the system has released all lockouts on computer access, and a nearby printer proves that Dillinger had plagiarized Flynn&#x27;s creations. The next morning, Dillinger enters his office to find the MCP deactivated and the proof of his theft publicized. Flynn is subsequently promoted to CEO of ENCOM and is happily greeted by Alan and Lora as their new boss.

=== Origins ===
The inspiration for &quot;Tron&quot; occurred in 1976 when Steven Lisberger, then an animator of drawings with his own studio, looked at a sample reel from a computer firm called MAGI and saw &quot;Pong&quot; for the first time. He was immediately fascinated by video games and wanted to do a film incorporating them. According to Lisberger, &quot;I realized that there were these techniques that would be very suitable for bringing video games and computer visuals to the screen. And that was the moment that the whole concept flashed across my mind&quot;. The film&#x27;s concept of entering a parallel game world was also inspired by the classic tale &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

Lisberger had already created an early version of the character &#x27;Tron&#x27; for a 30 second long animation which was used to promote both Lisberger Studios and a series of various rock radio stations. This backlit cel animation depicted Tron as a character who glowed yellow; the same shade that Lisberger had originally intended for all the heroic characters developed for the feature-length &quot;Tron&quot;. This was later changed to blue for the finished film (see Pre-production below). The prototype Tron was bearded and resembled the Cylon Centurions from the 1978 TV series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Also, Tron was armed with two &quot;exploding discs&quot;, as Lisberger described them on the 2-Disc DVD edition (see Rinzler).

Lisberger elaborates: &quot;Everybody was doing backlit animation in the 70s, you know. It was that disco look. And we thought, what if we had this character that was a neon line, and that was our Tron warrior – Tron for electronic. And what happened was, I saw &quot;Pong&quot;, and I said, well, that&#x27;s the arena for him. And at the same time I was interested in the early phases of computer generated animation, which I got into at MIT in Boston, and when I got into that I met a bunch of programmers who were into all that. And they really inspired me, by how much they believed in this new realm.&quot;

He was frustrated by the clique-like nature of computers and video games and wanted to create a film that would open this world up to everyone. Lisberger and his business partner Donald Kushner moved to the West Coast in 1977 and set up an animation studio to develop &quot;Tron&quot;. They borrowed against the anticipated profits of their 90-minute animated television special &quot;Animalympics&quot; to develop storyboards for &quot;Tron&quot; with the notion of making an animated film. But after &quot;Variety&quot; mentioned the project briefly during its early phase, it caught the attention of computer scientist Alan Kay. He contacted Lisberger and convinced him to use him as an adviser on the movie, then persuaded him to use real CGI instead of just hand-animation.

Bonnie MacBird wrote the first drafts of Tron with extensive input from Lisberger, basing the original personality of Alan on Alan Kay. As a result of working together, Kay and MacBird became close and later married. She also created Tron as a character (rather than a visual demo) and Flynn. Originally, MacBird envisioned Flynn more comedically, suggesting the then 30-year-old Robin Williams for the role. Besides many story changes after the script went to Disney, including giving it &quot;a more serious tone with quasi religious overtones&quot;, and removing most of the scientific elements, none of her dialogue remains in the final film, and there was a &quot;rather bitter credits dispute.&quot;

The film was eventually conceived as an animated film bracketed with live-action sequences. The rest involved a combination of computer-generated visuals and back-lit animation. Lisberger planned to finance the movie independently by approaching several computer companies but had little success. However, one company, Information International Inc., was receptive. He met with Richard Taylor, a representative, and they began talking about using live-action photography with back-lit animation in such a way that it could be integrated with computer graphics. At this point, there was a script and the film was entirely storyboarded, with some computer animation tests completed. He had spent approximately $300,000 developing &quot;Tron&quot; and had also secured $4–5 million in private backing before reaching a standstill. Lisberger and Kushner took their storyboards and samples of computer-generated films to Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Columbia Pictures – all of which turned them down.

In 1980, they decided to take the idea to Walt Disney Productions, which was interested in producing more daring productions at the time. Tom Wilhite, Disney&#x27;s vice president for creative development, watched Lisberger&#x27;s test footage and convinced Ron Miller to give the movie a chance. However, Disney executives were uncertain about giving $10–12 million to a first-time producer and director using techniques which, in most cases, had never been attempted. The studio agreed to finance a test reel which involved a flying disc champion throwing a rough prototype of the discs used in the film. It was a chance to mix live-action footage with back-lit animation and computer-generated visuals. It impressed the executives at Disney and they agreed to back the film. MacBird and Lisberger&#x27;s script was subsequently re-written and re-storyboarded with the studio&#x27;s input. At the time, Disney rarely hired outsiders to make films for them, and Kushner found that he and his group were given a chilly reception because they &quot;tackled the nerve center – the animation department. They saw us as the germ from outside. We tried to enlist several Disney animators, but none came. Disney is a closed group.&quot; As a result, they hired Wang Film Productions for the animation.

=== Production ===
Because of the many special effects, Disney decided in 1981 to film &quot;Tron&quot; completely in 65-mm Super Panavision (except for the computer-generated layers, which were shot in VistaVision; and both anamorphic 35mm and Super 35, which were used for some scenes in the &quot;real&quot; world, and subsequently &quot;blown up&quot; to 65 mm). Three designers were brought in to create the look of the computer world. French comic book artist Jean Giraud (also known as Moebius) was the main set and costume designer for the film. Most of the vehicle designs (including Sark&#x27;s aircraft carrier, the light cycles, the tank, and the solar sailer) were created by industrial designer Syd Mead. Peter Lloyd, a high-tech commercial artist, designed the environments. Nevertheless, these jobs often overlapped, leaving Giraud working on the solar sailer and Mead designing terrain, sets and the film&#x27;s logo. The original &#x27;Program&#x27; character design was inspired by Lisberger Studios&#x27; logo of a glowing bodybuilder hurling two discs.

To create the computer animation sequences of &quot;Tron&quot;, Disney turned to the four leading computer graphics firms of the day: Information International, Inc. of Culver City, California, who owned the Super Foonly F-1 (the fastest PDP-10 ever made and the only one of its kind); MAGI of Elmsford, New York; Robert Abel and Associates of California; and Digital Effects of New York City. Bill Kovacs worked on the film while working for Robert Abel before going on to found Wavefront Technologies. The work was not a collaboration, resulting in very different styles used by the firms.

&quot;Tron&quot; was one of the first films to make extensive use of any form of computer animation, and it is celebrated as a milestone in the industry, although only fifteen to twenty minutes of such animation were used (mostly scenes that show digital &quot;terrain&quot; or patterns, or include vehicles such as light-cycles, tanks and ships). Because the technology to combine computer animation and live action did not exist at the time, these sequences were interspersed with the filmed characters. One of the computers used had only 2 MB of memory and no more than 330 MB of storage. This put a limit on detail of background; and at a certain distance, they had a procedure of mixing in black to fade things out, a process called &quot;depth cueing&quot;. The film&#x27;s Computer Effects Supervisor Richard Taylor told them &quot;When in doubt, black it out!&quot;, which became their motto. Originally the film was meant to use white backgrounds like in &quot;THX 1138&quot; inside the Grid, but it would require such huge amounts of lights that it was decided to use black backgrounds instead.

The computers used at the time could not perform animation, so the frames had to be produced one by one. In some of the more complex sequences, like the Solar Sailer moving through metal canyons, each frame could take up to six hours to produce. There was no way to digitally print them on film, either; rather, a motion picture camera was placed in front of a computer screen to capture each individual frame.

Most of the scenes, backgrounds, and visual effects in the film were created using more traditional techniques and a unique process known as &quot;backlit animation&quot;. In this process, live-action scenes inside the computer world were filmed in black-and-white on an entirely black set, placed in an enlarger for blow-ups and transferred to large format Kodalith high-contrast film. These negatives were then used to make Kodalith sheets with a reverse (positive) image. Clear cels were laid over each sheet and all portions of the figure except the areas that were exposed for the later camera passes were manually blacked out. Next the Kodalith sheets and cel overlays were placed over a light box while a VistaVision camera mounted above it made separate passes and different color filters. A typical shot normally required 12 passes, but some sequences, like the interior of the electronic tank, could need as many as 50 passes. About 300 matte paintings were made for the film, each photographed onto a large piece of Ektachrome film before colors were added by gelatin filters in a similar procedure as in the Kodaliths. The mattes, rotoscopic and CGI were then combined and composed together to give them a &quot;technological&quot; appearance. With multiple layers of high-contrast, large format positives and negatives, this process required truckloads of sheet film and a workload even greater than that of a conventional cel-animated feature. The Kodalith was specially produced as large sheets by Kodak for the film and came in numbered boxes so that each batch of the film could be used in order of manufacture for a consistent image. However, this was not understood by the filmmakers and, as a result, glowing outlines and circuit traces occasionally flicker as the film speed varied between batches. After the reason was discovered, this was no longer a problem as the batches were used in order and &quot;zinger&quot; sounds were used during the flickering parts to represent the computer world malfunctioning as Lisberger described it. Lisberger later had these flickers and sounds digitally corrected for the 2011 restored Blu-ray release as they were not included in his original vision of the film. Due to its difficulty and cost, this process of back-lit animation was not repeated for another feature film.

Sound design and creation for the film was assigned to Frank Serafine, who was responsible for the sound design on &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; in 1979. “There were over 750 units [separate tape segments] in the picture,&quot; said Serafine. He created all the sound effects in the movie exclusively by synthesizers and similar electronic devices.

At one point in the film, a small entity called &quot;Bit&quot; advises Flynn with only the words &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; created by a Votrax speech synthesizer.

&quot;BYTE&quot; wrote: &quot;Although this film is very much the personal expression of Steven Lisberger&#x27;s vision, nevertheless [it] has certainly been a group effort&quot;. More than 569 people were involved in the post-production work, including 200 inkers and hand-painters, 85 of them from Taiwan&#x27;s Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest Studio. Unusual for an English-language production, in the end credits the Taiwanese personnel were listed with their names written in Chinese characters.

This film features parts of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; the multi-story ENCOM laser bay was the target area for the SHIVA solid-state multi-beamed laser. Also, the stairway that Alan, Lora, and Flynn use to reach Alan&#x27;s office is the stairway in Building 451 near the entrance to the main machine room. The cubicle scenes were shot in another room of the lab. At the time, &quot;Tron&quot; was the only film to have scenes filmed inside this lab.

The original script called for &quot;good&quot; programs to be colored yellow and &quot;evil&quot; programs (those loyal to Sark and the MCP) to be colored blue. Partway into production, this coloring scheme was changed to blue for good and red for evil, but some scenes were produced using the original coloring scheme: Clu, who drives a tank, has yellow circuit lines, and all of Sark&#x27;s tank commanders are blue (but appear green in some presentations). Also, the light-cycle sequence shows the heroes driving yellow (Flynn), orange (Tron), and red (Ram) cycles, while Sark&#x27;s troops drive blue cycles; similarly, Clu&#x27;s tank is red, while tanks driven by crews loyal to Sark are blue.

Because of all the personal information about citizens which exist inside computer networks, such as social security number and driver&#x27;s license, the idea was that each real world person has a digital counterpart inside the Grid based on information about them, which is why it was decided to use some of the same actors in both worlds.

Budgeting the production was difficult by reason of breaking new ground in response to additional challenges, including an impending Directors Guild of America strike and a fixed release date. Disney predicted at least $400 million in domestic sales of merchandise, including an arcade game by Bally Midway and three Mattel Intellivision home video games.

The producers also added Easter eggs: during the scene where Tron and Ram escape from the Light Cycle arena into the system, Pac-Man can be seen behind Sark (with the corresponding sounds from the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; arcade game being heard in the background), while a &quot;Hidden Mickey&quot; outline (located at time 01:12:29 on the re-release Blu-ray) can be seen below the solar sailer during the protagonists&#x27; journey. The film set also included the arcade games &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978), &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979) and &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980).

&quot;Tron&quot; was originally meant to be released during the Christmas season of 1982, but when chairman of the Disney board Card Walker found out the release date of Don Bluth&#x27;s film &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; was in early July, he rushed it into a summer release to be able to compete with Bluth, and it ended up competing with films like &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Poltergeist&quot;.

=== Music ===

The soundtrack for &quot;Tron&quot; was written by pioneer electronic musician Wendy Carlos, who is best known for her album &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; and for the soundtracks to many films, including the Stanley Kubrick-directed films &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot;. The music, which was the first collaboration between Carlos and her partner Annemarie Franklin, featured a mix of an analog Moog synthesizer and Crumar&#x27;s GDS digital synthesizer (complex additive and phase modulation synthesis), along with non-electronic pieces performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (hired at the insistence of Disney, which was concerned that Carlos might not be able to complete her score on time). Two additional musical tracks (&quot;1990&#x27;s Theme&quot; and &quot;Only Solutions&quot;) were provided by the American band Journey after British band Supertramp pulled out of the project. An album featuring dialogue, music and sound effects from the film was also released on LP by Disneyland Records in 1982.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Tron&quot; was released on July 9, 1982, in 1,091 theaters in the United States and Canada grossing USD $4 million on its opening weekend. It went on to gross $33 million in the United States and Canada and $17 million overseas, for a worldwide gross of approximately $50 million, which was Disney&#x27;s highest-grossing live action film for 5 years.

In addition, the film had $70 million in wholesale merchandise sales.

Despite the gross and merchandise sales, it was seen as a financial disappointment, and the studio wrote off some of its $17 million budget.

=== Critical response ===
The film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and described it as &quot;a dazzling movie from Disney in which computers have been used to make themselves romantic and glamorous. Here&#x27;s a technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish and fun&quot;. However, near the end of his review, he noted (in a positive tone), &quot;This is an almost wholly technological movie. Although it&#x27;s populated by actors who are engaging (Bridges, Cindy Morgan) or sinister (Warner), it&#x27;s not really a movie about human nature. Like &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; but much more so, this movie is a machine to dazzle and delight us&quot;. Ebert closed his first annual Overlooked Film Festival with a showing of &quot;Tron&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also awarded four out of four stars, calling it &quot;a trip, and a terrifically entertaining one at that...It&#x27;s a dazzler that opens up our minds to our new tools, all in a traditional film narrative.&quot; Each gave the film &quot;two thumbs up&quot;. &quot;Tron&quot; was also featured in Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s video pick of the week in 1993.

&quot;InfoWorld&quot;″s Deborah Wise was impressed, writing that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to believe the characters acted out the scenes on a darkened soundstage... We see characters throwing illuminated Frisbees, driving &#x27;lightcycles&#x27; on a video-game grid, playing a dangerous version of jai alai and zapping numerous fluorescent tanks in arcade-game-type mazes. It&#x27;s exciting, it&#x27;s fun, and it&#x27;s just what video-game fans and anyone with a spirit of adventure will love—despite plot weaknesses.&quot;

On the other hand, &quot;Variety&quot; disliked the film and said in its review, &quot;&quot;Tron&quot; is loaded with visual delights but falls way short of the mark in story and viewer involvement. Screenwriter-director Steven Lisberger has adequately marshalled a huge force of technicians to deliver the dazzle, but even kids (and specifically computer game geeks) will have a difficult time getting hooked on the situations&quot;. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin criticized the film&#x27;s visual effects: &quot;They&#x27;re loud, bright and empty, and they&#x27;re all this movie has to offer&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Gary Arnold wrote, &quot;Fascinating as they are as discrete sequences, the computer-animated episodes don&#x27;t build dramatically. They remain a miscellaneous form of abstract spectacle&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Jay Scott wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s got momentum and it&#x27;s got marvels, but it&#x27;s without heart; it&#x27;s a visionary technological achievement without vision&quot;.

Colin Greenland reviewed the home video release of &quot;Tron&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;three plucky young programmers descend into the micro-world to battle the Master Control Program with a sacred frisbee. Loses much of its excitement on the little screen.&quot;

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 73% rating based on the reviews of 71 critics, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Though perhaps not as strong dramatically as it is technologically, TRON is an original and visually stunning piece of science fiction that represents a landmark work in the history of computer animation.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 58 based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In the year it was released, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences refused to nominate &quot;Tron&quot; for a special-effects Academy Award because, as director Steven Lisberger puts it, &quot;The Academy thought we cheated by using computers&quot;. The film did, however, earn Oscar nominations in the categories of Best Costume Design (Elois Jenssen and Rosanna Norton) and Best Sound (Michael Minkler, Bob Minkler, Lee Minkler, and James LaRue).

=== Cultural effect ===
The success of &quot;Tron&quot; led to several of the film’s computer animators, including lead animator Chris Wedge, to create a new animation studio known as Blue Sky Studios in 1987 after their previous studio shut down.

In 1997, Ken Perlin of the Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for his invention of Perlin noise for &quot;Tron&quot;.

The film, considered groundbreaking, has inspired several individuals in numerous ways. John Lasseter, head of Pixar and Disney&#x27;s animation group, described how the film helped him see the potential of computer-generated imagery in the production of animated films, stating &quot;without &quot;Tron&quot;, there would be no &quot;Toy Story&quot;.&quot;

The two members of the French house music group Daft Punk, who scored the and also had a cameo appearance in it, have held a joint, lifelong fascination with the film. Also, in Gorillaz&#x27; music video for the song &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot;, Russel, the fictional drummer of the band, can be seen wearing an Encom hat.

&quot;Tron&quot; developed into a cult film and was ranked as 13th in a 2010 list of the top 20 cult films published by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

The film heavily inspired the music video for Danish pop/dance group Infernal&#x27;s 2006 hit single &quot;From Paris to Berlin&quot;. The music video for Australian rock band Regurgitator&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Everyday Formula&quot; was also heavily inspired by the film and recreates several scenes.

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Science Fiction Films list.

== Books ==
A novelization of &quot;Tron&quot; was released in 1982, written by American science fiction novelist Brian Daley. It included eight pages of color photographs from the movie. In the same year, Disney Senior Staff Publicist Michael Bonifer authored a book entitled &quot;The Art of Tron&quot; which covered aspects of the pre-production and post-production aspects of &quot;Tron&quot;. A nonfiction book about the making of the original film, &quot;The Making of Tron: How Tron Changed Visual Effects and Disney Forever&quot;, was written by William Kallay and published in 2011.

== Television ==
&quot;Tron&quot; made its television debut as part of the Disney Channel&#x27;s first day of programming, on April 18, 1983, at 7:00PM (ET).

== Home media ==
&quot;Tron&quot; was originally released on VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, and CED Videodisc on December 1, 1982. As with most video releases from the 1980s, the film was cropped to the 4:3 pan and scan format. The film saw multiple re-releases throughout the 1990s, most notably an &quot;Archive Collection&quot; LaserDisc box set, which featured the first release of the film in its original widescreen 2.20:1 format. By 1993, &quot;Tron&quot; had grossed in video rentals.

&quot;Tron&quot; saw its first DVD release on December 12, 2000. This bare-bones release utilized the same non-anamorphic video transfer used in the Archive Collection LaserDisc set, and it did not include any of the LD&#x27;s special features. On January 15, 2002, the film received a 20th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition release in the forms of a VHS and a special 2-Disc DVD set. This set featured a new THX mastered anamorphic video transfer and included all of the special features from the LD Archive Collection release, plus an all-new 90 minute &quot;Making of Tron&quot; documentary.

To tie in with the home video release of &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;, the movie was finally re-released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Special Edition DVD and for the first time on Blu-ray Disc on April 5, 2011, with the subtitle &quot;The Original Classic&quot; to distinguish it from its sequel. &quot;Tron&quot; was also featured in a 5-Disc Blu-ray Combo with the 3D copy of &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;. The film was re-released on Blu-ray and DVD in the UK on June 27, 2011.

== Theme Parks ==
In Disneyland, the PeopleMover attraction was updated in 1982 to include &quot;Tron&quot; film projections in the SuperSpeed Tunnel section of the ride, which was announced as the &quot;Game Grid of Tron&quot; by the on-board audio guide. After this addition, the attraction was advertised as the &quot;PeopleMover Thru the World of Tron&quot;.

In 2016, Shanghai Disneyland opened &quot;Tron&quot; Lightcycle Power Run, a semi-enclosed, launched roller coaster based on the original film and its sequel. Walt Disney World opened a nearly identical version in 2023, called &quot;Tron&quot; Lightcycle / Run. Both are in the Tomorrowland themed areas at each park.

== Sequels ==
=== &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; ===

On January 12, 2005, Disney announced it had hired screenwriters Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal to write a sequel to &quot;Tron&quot;. In 2008, director Joseph Kosinski negotiated to develop and direct &quot;TRON&quot;, described as &quot;the next chapter&quot; of the 1982 film and based on a preliminary teaser trailer shown at that year&#x27;s San Diego Comic-Con, with Lisberger co-producing. Filming began in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009. During the 2009 Comic-Con, the title of the sequel was revealed to be changed to &quot;&quot;. The second trailer (also with the &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; logo) was released in 3D with &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot;. A third trailer premiered at Comic-Con 2010 on July 22. At Disney&#x27;s D23 Expo on September 10–13, 2009, they also debuted teaser trailers for &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot; as well as having a light cycle and other props from the film there. The film was released on December 17, 2010, with Daft Punk composing the score.

=== &quot;Tron: Uprising&quot; (TV series) ===

&quot;Tron: Uprising&quot; is a 2012 animated series set between the events of the first two films. In the series, young program Beck becomes the leader of a revolution inside the computer world of the Grid, tasked with the mission of freeing his home and friends from the reign of Clu and his henchman, General Tesler. To prepare for the challenge, Beck is mentored by Tron – the greatest warrior The Grid has ever known – as he grows beyond his youthful nature into a courageous and powerful leader. Destined to become the system&#x27;s new protector, Beck adopts Tron&#x27;s persona to battle the forces of evil.

=== &quot;Tron: Ares&quot; ===

In October 2010, a third film was announced to be in development, with Kosinski returning as director with a script co-written by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis. The concept and ideas for a third film continued behind the scenes, from August 2016 to March 2017, when Jared Leto was announced to have signed on to co-star as a new character named Ares. In March 2022, Leto confirmed that the film was still in development. By January 2023, Garth Davis had exited as director, with Joachim Rønning entering negotiations to replace him; while production was planned to begin in Vancouver by August 2023. Initially scheduled to begin on August 14, 2023, principal photography was delayed due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. In June 2023, Evan Peters was set to join the cast. Following the conclusion of the strikes in early November 2023, filming was reportedly set to begin early 2024. In late November 2023 however, it was announced that production on the project would officially begin following the holiday season of the same year. The film is set to be released on October 10, 2025.

<text>Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb (27 August 1841 – 9 December 1905) was a British classical scholar and MP for Cambridge.

==Life==

Jebb was born in Dundee, Scotland, to Robert, a well-known Irish barrister, and Emily Harriet Horsley, daughter of the Reverend Heneage Horsley, Dean of Brechin. His grandfather Richard Jebb had been a judge of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench (Ireland). His sister was the social reformer Eglantyne Louisa Jebb, founder of the Home Arts and Industries Association.
Jebb was educated at St Columba&#x27;s College, Dublin 1853–55 and at Charterhouse School 1855–1858. He then studied Classics at Trinity College, Cambridge where he became a member of the Cambridge Apostles, an intellectual society, from 1859. 

Jebb won the Porson and Craven scholarships, was senior classic in 1862, and became fellow and tutor of his college in 1863. From 1869 to 1875, he was public orator of Cambridge University. 

On 18 August 1874, Jebb married Caroline Lane Reynolds, born in 1840 in Evansburg, Pennsylvania, whose first husband had been US Army Lieutenant Adam J. Slemmer. After his death in 1868, Caroline lived briefly in Cambridge. 

From 1875 to 1889 Jebb was Professor of Greek at Glasgow, and the couple initially lived in that city, spending their summers in Cambridge. In 1889 Jebb was appointed Regius Professor of Greek at Cambridge, following the death of the incumbent, Benjamin Hall Kennedy, and the couple moved permanently to Cambridge. 

In 1891 Jebb was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridge University, he was knighted in 1900, and he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1902. He received many honorary degrees from European and American universities, and in May 1902 at Caernarfon received the honorary degree of DLitt from the University of Wales during the ceremony to install the Prince of Wales (later King George V) as Chancellor of that university. In 1904, he was elected a member to the American Philosophical Society. In 1905, he was made a member of the Order of Merit.

Jebb died at his home, Springfield House in Cambridge, on 9 December 1905 and was buried at the St Giles Cemetery (now known as the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground) in the town. Caroline Jebb died and was cremated in America, her ashes being returned to Cambridge for interment in her husband&#x27;s grave.

==Works==

Jebb was acknowledged to be one of the most brilliant classical scholars of his time, a humanist and an unsurpassed translator from and into the classical languages. A collected volume, &quot;Translations into Greek and Latin&quot;, appeared in 1873 (ed. 1909).

Jebb&#x27;s publications include:
* &quot;The Characters of Theophrastus&quot; (1870), text, introduction, English translation and commentary (re-edited by JE Sandys, 1909)
* &quot;The Attic Orators from Antiphon to Isaeus&quot; (2nd ed., 1893), with companion volume, &quot;Selections from the Attic Orators&quot; (2nd ed, 1888)
* &quot;Bentley&quot; (1882)
* &quot;Sophocles&quot; (3rd ed., 1893) the seven plays, text, English translation and notes, the promised edition of the fragments being prevented by his death
* &quot;Bacchylides&quot; (1905), text, translation, and notes
* &quot;Homer&quot; (3rd ed., 1888), an introduction to the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;
* &quot;Modern Greece&quot; (1901)
* &quot;The Growth and Influence of Classical Greek Poetry&quot; (1893).

His translation of the &quot;Rhetoric&quot; of Aristotle was published posthumously under the editorship of J. E. Sandys (1909). A selection from his &quot;Essays and Addresses&quot;, and a subsequent volume, &quot;Life and Letters of Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb&quot; (with critical introduction by A. W. Verrall) were published by his widow in 1907; see also an appreciative notice by J. E. Sandys, &quot;History of Classical Scholarship, iii.&quot; (1908).

The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a collection of Jebb&#x27;s papers.

<text>Givatayim () is a city in Israel east of Tel Aviv. It is part of the Gush Dan metropolitan area. Givatayim was established in 1922 by pioneers of the Second Aliyah. In it had a population of .

The name of the city comes from the &quot;two hills&quot; on which it was established: Borochov Hill and Kozlovsky Hill. Kozlovsky is the highest hill in the Gush Dan region at above sea level. The city was expanded in the 1930s so that today it is actually situated on 4 hills, Borochov, Kozlovsky, the Poalei HaRakevet (&quot;railroad workers&quot;), and Rambam Hill.


==History==
===Antiquity===
Archaeological remains of a Chalcolithic settlement have been found at the site of what is now Givatayim.

===British Mandate era===
The modern town was founded on April 2, 1922 by a group of 22 Second Aliyah pioneers led by David Schneiderman. The group purchased 300 dunams () of land on the outskirts of Tel Aviv that became the Borochov Neighbourhood (&quot;Shechunat/Shekhunat Borochov&quot;), the first workers&#x27; neighbourhood in the country. It was named for Dov Ber Borochov, founder of the Poalei Zion workers&#x27; party. Later, another 70 families joined the group, receiving smaller plots. The land was purchased with their private savings, but was voluntarily transferred to the Jewish National Fund, which organized Jewish settlement at the time, in keeping with the pioneers&#x27; socialist beliefs.

Shechunat Borochov is credited for a number of innovations in the early Jewish settlement movement, including establishing the first cooperative grocery store (&quot;Tzarkhaniya&quot;, &quot;Consumer&quot;) that still functioned in the same location into the 1980s.

Shechunat Rambam was another neighborhood in what is today known as Givatayim. Rambam used to be more &quot;bourgeois&quot; in the eyes of Borochov&#x27;s founders, who were considered socialists. Thus, the two neighborhoods used to function differently from an economic viewpoint.

Over time, more neighborhoods developed: Sheinkin (1936; named after Menahem Sheinkin), Givat Rambam (1933; named after Maimonides), Kiryat Yosef (1934; named after the biblical figure), and Arlozorov (1936; named after Haim Arlosoroff).

All these neighborhoods were merged to form a local council in August 1942. The city was also settled on Al-Khayriyya in April 1948, a former Palestinian village.

===State of Israel===
Givatayim was declared a city in 1959.

==Education and culture==
Givatayim has 41 kindergartens, 9 elementary schools and 4 high schools. As of 2018, the city has one of the highest rate of secondary school matriculation in the country. Mayor Ruven Ben-Shachar initiated a special high school exam assistance program that after 3 years resulted in an 11% increase of high school test results in 2010.

==Urban development==
Eurocom Tower is a 70-story skyscraper consisting of four apartment towers and a 50-story office building. A large square connects to surrounding areas with bridges and underground passes. The complex is near Ramat Gan and its Diamond Exchange District.

In addition to Eurocom Tower, other high-rise projects are planned for the city. According to former Givatayim mayor Reuven Ben-Shahar, the municipality&#x27;s policy is to promote high-rise construction on the city&#x27;s outer edges, while preserving the fabric of residential neighborhoods deeper within the city, including the city center. Current plans for the northwest of the city envision high-rise towers along Katznelson and Aliyat Hanoar Streets near the boundaries of Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan. As part of the redevelopment, Katznelson Street will be colonnaded along its length and a 2-meter-wide cycle paths are planned for both sides of the road, with one lane for buses and another for cars.

<text>Carl Jacob Christoph Burckhardt (25 May 1818 – 8 August 1897) was a Swiss historian of art and culture and an influential figure in the historiography of both fields. His best known work is &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot; (1860). He is known as one of the major progenitors of cultural history. Sigfried Giedion described Burckhardt&#x27;s achievement in the following terms: &quot;The great discoverer of the age of the Renaissance, he first showed how a period should be treated in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the social institutions of its daily life as well.&quot;

== Life ==
The son of a Protestant clergyman, Burckhardt was born in Basel, where he studied theology in the hope of taking holy orders; however, under the influence of Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette, he chose not to become a clergyman. He was a member of the patrician Burckhardt family.

Burckhardt finished his degree in 1839 and went to the University of Berlin to study history, especially art history, then a new field. At Berlin, he attended lectures by Leopold von Ranke, the founder of history as a respectable academic discipline based on sources and records rather than personal opinions. He spent part of 1841 at the University of Bonn, studying under the art historian Franz Theodor Kugler, to whom he dedicated his first book, &quot;Die Kunstwerke der belgischen Städte&quot; (1842).

Burckhardt taught at the University of Basel from 1843 to 1855, then at the Federal Polytechnic School. In 1858, he returned to Basel to assume the professorship he held until his retirement in 1893. He started to teach only art history in 1886. He twice declined offers of professorial chairs at German universities, at the University of Tübingen in 1867 and Ranke&#x27;s chair at the University of Berlin in 1872.

==Work==
Burckhardt&#x27;s historical writings did much to establish the importance of art in the study of history; indeed, he was one of the &quot;founding fathers of art history&quot; but also one of the original creators of cultural history. Contra John Lukacs, who has argued that Burckhardt represents one of the first historians to rise above the narrow 19th-century notion that &quot;history is past politics and politics current history,&quot; Lionel Gossman claims that in stressing the importance of art, literature, and architecture as a primary source for the study of history, Burckhardt (in common with later Dutch cultural historian Johan Huizinga) saw himself as working in the tradition of the French romantic historian Jules Michelet. Burckhardt&#x27;s unsystematic approach to history was strongly opposed to the interpretations of Hegelianism, which was popular at the time; economism as an interpretation of history; and positivism, which had come to dominate scientific discourses (including the discourse of the social sciences).

In 1838, Burckhardt made his first journey to Italy and published his first important article, &quot;Bemerkungen über schweizerische Kathedralen&quot; (&quot;Remarks about Swiss Cathedrals&quot;). Burckhardt delivered a series of lectures at the University of Basel, which were published in 1943 by Pantheon Books Inc., under the title &quot;Force and Freedom: An Interpretation of History by Jacob Burckhardt&quot;. In 1847, he brought out new editions of Kugler&#x27;s two great works, &quot;Geschichte der Malerei&quot; and &quot;Kunstgeschichte&quot;, and in 1853, he published his own work, &quot;Die Zeit Constantins des Grossen&quot; (&quot;The Age of Constantine the Great&quot;). He spent the greater part of the years 1853 and 1854 in Italy, collecting material for his 1855 &quot;Der Cicerone: Eine Anleitung zum Genuss der Kunstwerke Italiens&quot; (&quot;The Cicerone: or, Art-guide to painting in Italy. For the use of travellers&quot;) also dedicated to Kugler. The work, &quot;the finest travel guide that has ever been written&quot; which covered sculpture and architecture, and painting, became an indispensable guide to the art traveller in Italy.

About half of the original edition was devoted to the art of the Renaissance. This was followed by the two books for which Burckhardt is best known today, his 1860 &quot;Die Cultur der Renaissance in Italien&quot; (&quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot;) (English translation, by S. G. C. Middlemore, in 2 vols., London, 1878), and his 1867 &quot;Geschichte der Renaissance in Italien&quot; (&quot;The History of the Renaissance in Italy&quot;). &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot; was the most influential interpretation of the Italian Renaissance in the 19th century and is still widely read.

In connection with this work Burckhardt may have been the first historian to use the term &quot;modernity&quot; in a clearly defined, academic context. Burckhardt understood Renaissance as drawing together art, philosophy and politics, and made the case that it created &quot;modern man&quot;. Burckhardt developed an ambivalent interpretation of modernity and the effects of the Renaissance, praising the movement as introducing new forms of cultural and religious freedom but also worrying about the potential feelings of alienation and disenchantment modern men might feel. These claims proved quite controversial, but the scholarly judgements of Burckhardt&#x27;s &quot;History of the Renaissance&quot; are sometimes considered to be justified by subsequent research, according to historians including Desmond Seward and art historians such as Kenneth Clark. Burckhardt and the German historian Georg Voigt founded the historical study of the Renaissance. In contrast to Voigt, who confined his studies to early Italian humanism, Burckhardt dealt with all aspects of Renaissance society.

Burckhardt considered the study of ancient history an intellectual necessity and was a highly respected scholar of Greek civilization. &quot;The Greeks and Greek Civilization&quot; sums up the relevant lectures, &quot;Griechische Kulturgeschichte&quot;, which Burckhardt first gave in 1872 and which he repeated until 1885. At the time of his death, he was working on a four-volume survey of Greek civilization, which was published posthumously with additional work by others.

&quot;Judgments on History and Historians&quot; is based on Burckhardt&#x27;s lectures on history at the University of Basel between 1865 and 1885. It provides his insights and interpretation of the events of the entire sweep of Western Civilization from Antiquity to the Age of Revolution, including the Middle Ages, History from 1450 to 1598, the History of the Seventeenth and the Eighteenth Centuries.

==Politics==
There is a tension in Burckhardt&#x27;s persona between the wise and worldly student of the Italian Renaissance and the cautious product of Swiss Calvinism, which he had studied extensively for the ministry. The Swiss polity in which he spent nearly all of his life was a good deal more democratic and stable than was the norm in 19th-century Europe. As a Swiss, Burckhardt was also cool to German nationalism and to German claims of cultural and intellectual superiority. He was also amply aware of the rapid political and economic changes taking place in the Europe of his day and commented in his lectures and writings on the Industrial Revolution, the European political upheavals of his day, and the growing European nationalism and militarism. Events amply fulfilled his prediction of a cataclysmic 20th century, in which violent demagogues (whom he called &quot;terrible simplifiers&quot;) would play central roles. In later years, Burckhardt found himself unimpressed by democracy, individualism, socialism, and a great many other ideas fashionable during his lifetime. He also observed over a century ago that &quot;the state incurs debts for politics, war, and other higher causes and &#x27;progress&#x27;... The assumption is that the future will honor this relationship in perpetuity. The state has learned from the merchants and industrialists how to exploit credit; it defies the nation ever to let it go into bankruptcy. Alongside all swindlers the state now stands there as swindler-in-chief.&quot;

==Legacy==

After his death, a medal was commissioned in his honour in 1898, which was made by the Swiss engraver Hans Frei (1868-1947).

Friedrich Nietzsche, appointed professor of classical philology at Basel in 1869 at the age of 24, admired Burckhardt and attended some of his lectures. Both men were admirers of the late Arthur Schopenhauer. Nietzsche believed Burckhardt agreed with the thesis of his &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, that Greek culture was defined by opposing &quot;Apollonian&quot; and &quot;Dionysian&quot; tendencies. Nietzsche and Burckhardt enjoyed each other&#x27;s intellectual company, even as Burckhardt kept his distance from Nietzsche&#x27;s evolving philosophy. Their extensive correspondence over a number of years has been published.

Burckhardt&#x27;s student Heinrich Wölfflin succeeded him at the University of Basel at the age of only 28. In turn, Wölfflin&#x27;s successor, Werner Kaegi, devoted his life&#x27;s work to completing a six-volume intellectual biography of Burckhardt, in addition to translating the work of pioneering Dutch cultural historian Johan Huizinga into German. Gossman has argued that, &quot;The extensive correspondence between Kaegi and Huizinga is evidence of the close intellectual and personal relation between Huizinga and the man who felt he had inherited the mantle of Burckhardt.&quot;

In 2018, the British Academy hosted an international conference on the occasion of Burckhardt&#x27;s bicentenary. This conference tasked an interdisciplinary team of scholars of Renaissance studies as well as of Burckhardt himself to interrogate both the Swiss historian’s own agenda as well as the contemporary validity and helpfulness of the label ‘Italian Renaissance’.

Burckhardt was featured on the Swiss thousand franc banknote.

<text>Maurizio Pollini (5 January 1942 – 23 March 2024) was an Italian pianist and conductor. He was known for performances of Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, and the Second Viennese School, among others. He championed works by contemporary composers, including Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, George Benjamin, Roberto Carnevale, Gianluca Cascioli and Bruno Maderna. Several compositions were written for him, including Luigi Nono&#x27;s &quot;... sofferte onde serene ...&quot;, Giacomo Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;Masse: omaggio a Edgard Varèse&quot;, and Salvatore Sciarrino&#x27;s Fifth Sonata. As a conductor he was instrumental in the Rossini revival at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, conducting &quot;La donna del lago&quot; from a new critical edition in 1981. He also conducted from the keyboard.

Pollini was also a left-wing activist in the 1960s and 1970s, and he remained politically engaged in later life. He maintained some separation between these ideals and his music.

== Life and career ==

=== 1942–early 1960s: Upbringing, studies, and competitions ===
Pollini was born in Milan in 1942. His father Gino Pollini was an amateur violinist. Gino was among the first architects of Gruppo 7 to bring modern architecture to Italy in the 1930s. His mother Renata Melotti had trained as a pianist and singer. She was a sister of the Italian sculptor Fausto Melotti.
Pollini studied piano with notable local teacher Carlo Lonati from age seven. Lonati allowed him to play what he loved, he remembered. When Lonati died, his student Carlo Vidusso became Pollini&#x27;s next teacher. Pollini remained Vidusso&#x27;s student from age 13 to 18. Vidusso trained Pollini strictly at the Milan Conservatory, preparing him to compete. Pollini also studied composition and conducting there.

He made his debut in Milan at the age of 15, performing a selection of Chopin&#x27;s Etudes. In 1957 he took second prize, after Martha Argerich, in the Geneva International Music Competition at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève. He won both the 1959 International Ettore Pozzoli Piano Competition in Seregno and the 1960 sixth International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw at the age of 18. He was the youngest of 89 entrants and the first non-Slav to win in the history of the competition. He selected among the most formidable of the possible etudes the &quot;Octave&quot;, &quot;Winter Wind&quot;, and &quot;Waterfall&quot;, which assessed as qualifying Pollini for &quot;the madhouse or victory&quot;. Arthur Rubinstein, leading the jury, declared &quot;that boy can play the piano better than any of us&quot;.

After these successes, Pollini did not perform for one year. He limited his concertizing in the 1960s to study, broadening his musical experience and expanding his pianistic repertoire. This led to erroneous rumors that he had become a recluse. He taped performances of Chopin&#x27;s Etudes and recorded Chopin&#x27;s First Concerto with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Paul Kletzki for EMI. He had a &quot;crisis of confidence&quot;, as Peter Andry described it, when the Philharmonia offered him a concert series.

He studied with pianist Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli for six months in the early 1960s. Michelangeli&#x27;s repertoire was select and polished by rigorous practice. Pollini obtained &quot;a precise technique and emotional restraint&quot;. Some expressed concern that Michelangeli&#x27;s influence led to Pollini&#x27;s style becoming &quot;mannered and cold&quot; or &quot;drier, more cerebral&quot;. While known for exceptional technique, Pollini was criticized for emotional conservatism. John Rockwell summarized Pollini&#x27;s &quot;hard‐edged and modern&quot; style as one of &quot;coolness, intensity and virtuosity&quot;, noting his tonal control and &quot;sheer dexterity&quot;.

=== Mid-1960s–1970s: Early career and musical and political collaboration ===

Beginning in the mid-1960s, Pollini gave recitals and appeared with orchestras in Europe, the United States, and the Far East. His American debut was in 1968 at Carnegie Hall in New York. He first toured Japan in 1974. Once wary of becoming pigeonholed as a specialist, especially of Chopin, he had &quot;clearly avoided that tag&quot; by the 1970s, Rockwell noted while surveying Pollini&#x27;s discography in its then range from Mozart to Nono.

Especially in the 1960s and 1970s, Pollini was active as a left-wing musician. His collaborative work with Claudio Abbado and Luigi Nono was informed by their shared ideals. He was also musically and politically associated with Giacomo Manzoni and . Pollini worked with Nono in such works as &quot;Como una ola de fuerza y luz&quot; (1972), which mourned the death of Luciano Cruz, a leader of the Revolutionary Left Movement in Chile. He performed with Abbado at La Scala in Milan in concerts for students and workers, aiming to build a public among them in the spirit that art should be for everybody. The two concertized for the Russell Tribunal. At least one of Pollini&#x27;s recitals was concluded upon audience unrest and police intervention when he attempted to make a statement about the Vietnam War.

He was able to separate his politics from his musicianship, for example in his work with Karl Böhm.
Nono wrote &quot;... sofferte onde serene ...&quot; for Pollini in 1974–1976. It was a meditative soloistic piece on recent losses among their family and friends. Pollini&#x27;s 1977 live performance was amplified against a magnetic tape recording of himself. Nono thereby explored pianistic envelope (&quot;Sometimes I cut off the attack, so that the sound manifests as a resonance without time&quot;) and the sounds of Venice (where &quot;one constantly hears the sound of bells&quot;). Nono cited an attraction to Pollini&#x27;s technique in particular. He sought to amplify and project details of Pollini&#x27;s sound (&quot;certain nuances of his touch&quot;). They worked together for three days in the recording studio at Radio Milano with audio engineer Marino Zuccheri. The work remained in Pollini&#x27;s repertoire; he later played it in London at the Southbank Centre&#x27;s &quot;Fragments of Venice&quot; festival (2007) and in Salzburg (2019).

Pollini took up Boulez&#x27;s &quot;weighty&quot; Second Sonata in the 1970s. In 1977, he played Bartok&#x27;s Second Concerto under Boulez with the New York Philharmonic. Harold C. Schonberg wrote that he &quot;had not heard a stronger account&quot;.

=== 1980s–2024: Later career and conducting ===
Pollini also conducted when he played piano concertos such as Mozart&#x27;s. He played a &quot;defining role&quot; in the Rossini Opera Festival at Pesaro, conducting &quot;La donna del lago&quot; from a new critical edition in 1981. The occasion was a &quot;landmark&quot; in the post-war Rossini revival. He was praised for his interpretive insights into Rossini&#x27;s orchestration, motivic development, and harmony. But he was criticized for his inflexible literalism and quick tempi, which drove to tears. Scholars cited historical evidence and showed him autograph manuscripts to persuade him to allow more ornamentation and rubato, hallmarks, particularly in the elaborate fioritura of cadential passages. He relented only in the final rondò, &quot;Tanti affetti in tal momento&quot;, for which Rossini prepared three ossia for particular singers. Pollini insisted that the singers adhere to these sources.

He tempered this approach somewhat in a 1983 reprise featuring Katia Ricciarelli (Elena), Lucia Valentini Terrani (Malcolm), and Samuel Ramey (Duglas) with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, which Sony recorded. For this production, his friend Gae Aulenti stage directed and designed the sets.

Among those celebrating Webern&#x27;s 1983 birth centenary in New York and at the Venice Festival of Contemporary Music, Pollini played the Piano Variations. Celebrating J. S. Bach&#x27;s 1985 tricentenary, he performed &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, Book I. He later recorded it in 2009.

In 1987, he received the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s Honorary Ring while playing Beethoven&#x27;s piano concertos with them in New York conducted by Abbado. In 1993–1994, he played his first complete Beethoven sonata cycle in Berlin and Munich. He continued this in New York City, at La Scala, in London, Paris and Vienna.

He juxtaposed old and new music at the 1995 Salzburg Festival in the &quot;Progetto Pollini&quot; concert series, at Carnegie Hall (2000–2001) in &quot;Perspectives: Maurizio Pollini&quot;, and at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall (2010–2011) in the &quot;Project Pollini&quot;, a five-concert series ranging from Bach to Boulez and Stockhausen (with Schoenberg&#x27;s Op. 19 as an encore). Throughout his career, Pollini championed less popular, often more recent works. He financed these projects with the prize money of the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize. On Mozart&#x27;s 250th birth centenary at the 2006 Salzburg Festival, he changed the second half of the program to Webern&#x27;s Piano Variations and Boulez&#x27;s Second Sonata. Some among the audience left at intermission, after the Webern, or during the Boulez.

Pollini continued politically identifying with the left, although he later questioned some Italian leftists&#x27; tactics. In 2010, he spoke out against Silvio Berlusconi, concertizing in opposition to constitutional reforms. He offered low-cost, student tickets to his concerts.

In March 2012, Pollini canceled his US appearances, citing his health. He toured Central Europe in 2014, performing at the Salzburg Festival and debuting at the Rheingau Musik Festival with Chopin&#x27;s &quot; Preludes&quot; and Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Preludes&quot;, Book I, in the Kurhaus Wiesbaden. In 2022, his 80th birthday recital received a four-star award in The Times.

==Private life==
In 1968 Pollini married Maria Elisabetta Marzotto, known as Marilisa, a pianist from a Milanese family. Maurizio Pollini died on 23 March 2024, aged 82. His son is a pianist and a conductor.

== Recordings ==
Pollini&#x27;s first recordings for Deutsche Grammophon (DG) in 1971 included Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Trois mouvements de Petrouchka&quot; and Prokofiev&#x27;s Seventh Sonata. They are considered landmarks of twentieth-century piano discography. He recorded Chopin&#x27;s Etudes, Opp. 10 and 25 in 1972 and Schoenberg&#x27;s solo piano in 1974 for the same label. In 2014, he recorded the entire Beethoven piano sonatas cycle. DG celebrated Pollini&#x27;s 60th birthday (2002) with a 13-CD commemorative edition and his 75th (2017) with a complete 58-CD edition.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 1996, Pollini received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize. In 2001, his recording of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot; won the Diapason d&#x27;Or. In 2007, Pollini received the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) for his Deutsche Grammophon recording of Chopin&#x27;s Nocturnes. He was awarded the Praemium Imperiale in 2010, and entered the Gramophone Hall of Fame in 2012.

<text>Benno Moiseiwitsch (22 February 18909 April 1963) was a Russian and British pianist.

==Biography==
Moiseiwitsch was born to Jewish parents in Odessa, Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire, and began his studies at age seven with Dmitry Klimov at the Odessa Music Academy. He won the Anton Rubinstein Prize when he was just nine years old. He studied with Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna from 1904 to 1908, then joined his own family in England, making his English debut at Reading in 1908, his London debut the following year. While in Dublin during the war he met another Leschetizky student, Mabel Lander, and they began plans to establish a piano school together in London that would use the Leschetizky method. But the plans had to be abandoned due to Moiseiwitsch&#x27;s increasingly heavy international concert schedule. He toured the United States (first in 1919), Australia, India, Japan, and South America. Moiseiwitsch was invited by Director Josef Hofmann to teach at the Curtis Institute of Music in 1927. He settled in England and took British citizenship in 1937.

Moiseiwitsch was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1946 for services to music during the Second World War, having performed hundreds of recitals for servicemen and charities.

He married Daisy Kennedy, an Australian concert violinist, and had two daughters, the set designer Tanya Moiseiwitsch and Sandra (1922-1996). He and his second wife Anita had a son, noted New Zealand National Radio broadcaster Boris Moiseiwitsch.

He was a friend of Nikolai Medtner and commissioned the Piano Concerto No. 3 &quot;Ballade&quot; (1940–43). Like his friend Mark Hambourg he was a member of the Savage Club. He was also a skilled wrestler, and arranged several friendly matches with the critic Ralph Hill, also a wrestling enthusiast.

==Playing style==
Moiseiwitsch was particularly known for his interpretations of the late Romantic repertoire, especially the works of Sergei Rachmaninoff (who was an admirer of his playing and referred to Moiseiwitsch as his &quot;spiritual heir&quot;) and Robert Schumann, whose piano music gave Moiseiwitsch &quot;more emotional and spiritual satisfaction than anyone else.&quot; At the piano, Moiseiwitsch was noted for his elegance, poetry, lyrical phrasing, brilliance, rhythmic freedom, and relaxed virtuosity.

He made recordings for the His Master&#x27;s Voice starting in the 78RPM shellac era, continuing with long-playing records and into the early stereo era. His distinctive style can be heard in his recording of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; and the Barcarolle, Ballade No. 4 and Nocturne, Op. 62 of Frédéric Chopin. In 1950 critic and musicologist Irving Kolodin said about the Ballade in F minor of Chopin played by Moiseiwitsch: &quot;A featherweight touch in the opening section of this work, an apt feeling for its &quot;once upon a time&quot; narrative quality give Moiseiwitsch pre-eminence among present day interpreters...&quot;, thus summing up the sensitivity of the playing by Benno Moiseiwitsch. He worked meticulously and amicably as a chamber musician, including in Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Trio Élégiaque&quot; and Cello Sonata in G minor. American critic Harold C. Schonberg praised Moiseiwitsch&#x27;s formidable technique and free approach to the music, adding that such freedom was &quot;always tempered by impeccable musicality.&quot;

==Discography==
A comprehensive list of Moiseiwitsch&#x27;s discography does not exist, but much of his recorded output is available on CD. Although there are duplicates of his recordings on various labels, they differ in sound quality because of the different restoration techniques employed by each of the companies.
