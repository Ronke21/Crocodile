<text>Gaspard de Coligny, seigneur de Châtillon (; 16 February 1519 – 24 August 1572), was a French nobleman, Admiral of France, and Huguenot leader during the French Wars of Religion. He served under kings Francis I and Henry II during the Italian Wars, attaining great prominence both due to his military skill and his relationship with his uncle, the king&#x27;s favourite Anne de Montmorency. During the reign of Francis II he converted to Protestantism, becoming a leading noble advocate for the Reformation during the early reign of Charles IX.

With the outbreak of civil war in 1562, Coligny joined the Huguenots in their fight against the Crown. He served as a lieutenant to Louis, Prince of Condé throughout the first two civil wars, before becoming the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of their military efforts after Condé&#x27;s death during the third civil war. Due to accusations levelled at him by the assassin of the Catholic Francis, Duke of Guise, in 1563 the powerful Guise family accused him of responsibility for the assassination, and unsuccessfully tried to bring a case against him. Coligny was assassinated at the start of the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, in 1572, on the orders of Henry, Duke of Guise.

==Family and early life==
Coligny came of a noble family of Burgundy. His family traced their descent from the 11th century, and in the reign of Louis XI, were in the service of the King of France. Gaspard&#x27;s father, Gaspard I de Coligny, known as the &#x27;Marshal of Châtillon&#x27;, served in the Italian Wars from 1494 to 1516, married in 1514, and was created Marshal of France in 1516, and from his wife, Louise de Montmorency, sister of the future constable, he had three sons, all of whom played an important part in the first period of the Wars of Religion: Odet, Gaspard and François.

Born at Châtillon-sur-Loing in 1519, Gaspard was raised by Louise de Montmorency and his uncle Anne after the death of his father in 1522. Louise ensured he received an education at the hands of Nicolas Bérauld. Under Bérauld&#x27;s guidance he studied the classics, including Cicero and Ptolemy. Both Bérauld and Louise came from a humanist background and had friendships with Protestant figures, such as Louis de Berquin and Michelle de Saubonne, and it was in this milieu that Coligny grew up.

==Reign of Francis I==
Coligny distinguished himself in the campaign of 1543 where he was wounded at the sieges of Montmédy and Bains. In 1544 he served in the Italian campaigns under the Count of Enghien, commanding a regiment, and was knighted on the Field of Ceresole. Returning to France, he took part in different military operations, including Strozzi&#x27;s expedition to England in 1545.

==Reign of Henri II==
===Return of Montmorency===
Upon the accession of the dauphin Henri II, Montmorency returned to favour from disgrace, and Coligny quickly benefitted, being made colonel-general of the infantry a month into Henri&#x27;s reign. He exhibited great capacity and intelligence as a military reformer, the regulations he drew up for maintaining infantry discipline being formally sanctioned by the king in 1551. Shortly thereafter he was further elevated with a position as a Knight of the Order of St. Michel. That year he married Charlotte de Laval (d. 1568).

===Advancement===
At this time he was close friends with two of the other leading men at court Francis, Duke of Guise and Piero Strozzi. Office continued to flow to him due to his uncles close relationship with the king. In 1549 he was made sous-lieutenant of the Boulonnais, and then Boulogne-sur-Mer a year later. In 1551, he was made Governor of Paris, a much coveted office. A year later he followed this acquisition with that of the title of Admiral, inherited from the recently deceased Claude d&#x27;Annebaut. This post had little to do with naval affairs, but was second in prestige behind that held by his uncle Constable Montmorency. With war resumed in 1552 Coligny as Colonel-General of the infantry played a key role under Guise&#x27;s command in the French victory at Battle of Renty. Dispute between Coligny and Guise over who deserved credit for the victory almost ended in the drawing of swords, before Henri II oversaw the kiss of peace between them, nevertheless their friendship was jeopardised. In a testament to the extreme favour he was in at court, in 1555 he was awarded a second governorship, that of the important border district of Picardy, replacing the first prince of the blood Antoine of Navarre much to his frustration. 
In 1555, under the leadership of his friend and navy colleague, Vice-Admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon, he attempted to establish the colony of France Antarctique in Rio de Janeiro. They were afterwards expelled by the Portuguese, in 1567. His combined efforts with those of his uncle, persuaded Henri to attain the 5 year truce, which he would do at Vaucelles in February 1556. During 1556 however, he would lose his governorship of the capital to François de Montmorency, whom Henri had promised Anne would receive it.

===Resumption of hostilities===
With war resumed in late 1556, Coligny made an abortive surprise attack on Douai on 6 January, timed to coincide with the feast of Epiphany. With this a failure, he changed course, sacking Lens, Pas-de-Calais, ravaging the frontier and returning with plunder. Henri, frustrated at the timing of the attack, ordered Coligny to return prisoners and goods taken in the raid on 17 January, much to the Admirals anger. In 1557 he was entrusted with the defence of Saint-Quentin which was besieged by a Spanish army that had come down from Flanders. With the crushing defeat of the relief army under Montmorency at the battle of Saint-Quentin Coligny assured the king he had supplies to hold the town for eight weeks. However 9 days later on 29 August, the Spanish would break the towns defences, and he was imprisoned in the stronghold of L&#x27;Ecluse. His brother Francois de Coligny d&#x27;Andelot had also been among the towns defenders however he managed to escape. The king harshly criticised Coligny for failing to hold the town for longer. The condition of his imprisonment was harsh, the dampness and cold leaving him ill. On payment of a ransom of 50,000 crowns he recovered his liberty.

===Coligny and Calvinism===

Throughout this period, Protestantism was beginning to find converts in the upper echelons of the French aristocracy. Coligny&#x27;s brother Andelot was an early convert, bringing the faith back with him from his captivity in Milan in 1556. He would not however be open in his newfound faith until attending services in 1558. In 1558, while imprisoned in Flanders, Andelot sent a Protestant devotional book, as a way to console his brother during his time in captivity. The timing of Coligny&#x27;s conversion to Calvinism is unclear, but by September 1558 he had received a letter about his salvation from Calvin. The priest Viret spoke highly of Coligny, praising him as a man of Christian virtue. Coligny&#x27;s religious allegiance was suspect at court by 1559, the English ambassador noting his absence at Mass. For the moment though Coligny maintained public silence on the matter.

==Reign of Francis II==
===Amboise===
Following the sudden death of Henri, at a joust to commemorate the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis he participated in the conference between the House of Bourbon and House of Montmorency at Vendôme, to negotiate their respective places in the new order. The conference would achieve little, except for ending a Montmorency feud with the House of Bourbon-Montpensier and both families would be outmanoeuvred by the Guise. Frustrated at the loss of his pre-eminence, Montmorency withdrew from court. When he was approached to partake in the Conspiracy of Amboise Coligny rebuffed the advances, being on good terms with Guise, even staying at his palace in Nanteuil during the Autumn of 1559. In January 1560 he resigned his governorship of Picardy, frustrated his request for funding of fortifications for several towns had been denied. Coligny visited court in February to gain details about a possible operation in support of Mary of Guise in Scotland against Elizabeth I. It was this endeavour that consumed Coligny and Andelot during the period of the conspiracy. In the wake of the conspiracy, Coligny wrote to Catherine, lending his support to the Edict of Amboise (1560).

===Assembly of Notables===

In April, Coligny was sent to Normandy to continue preparations for the Scottish campaign. Conscious of the failure of prior religious policy, and seeking a new direction for the country, Coligny was among those who pressured for the calling of an Assembly of Notables in late 1560.
When the assembly met at Fontainebleau, hostility emerged between Coligny and François de Guise after Coligny derailed the Guise plans for the summit by proposing coexistence between the Protestantism and Catholicism, presenting the assembly with 50,000 signatures. Coligny argued there could not be tranquillity and order in the realm, unless such a step was taken, on at least a temporary basis, until a religious council could sort out matters. Guise snapped back that it was best to leave such church matters to more learned men, Lorraine retorted he could find one million signatures for a counter-petition. Lorraine however went on to strike a softer tone, arguing that the faiths should be brought back together through reform and the summit ended with an agreement to call a council. Coligny was among those in the assembly who argued in favour of an estates general, decrying the seclusion of the king from his people. While Coligny had failed to win over the assembly, he had marked himself out as the most eloquent leader of the reform party.
===Condé crisis and the death of Francis II===
In September, the Châtillons and Montmorency, troubled by the disturbances that still plagued France in the wake of Amboise, withdrew to their estates. On 4 October he was appointed governor of Honfleur and Le Havre. His family would play no part in the arrest of Condé for his involvement in the Lyon conspiracy. In November, Francis II became sick, troubled by an ear infection, which gradually worsened until the king passed away on 5 December. With the death of Francis, the Guise&#x27;s hold on government collapsed, Coligny celebrated their misfortune.

Several days after the king&#x27;s death, Coligny and the duke of Guise got into a fierce argument. News of an uprising in Brittany had arrived at court. Coligny proposed understanding the rising&#x27;s motives before acting, enraging Guise, who felt motive was irrelevant when they were violating the king&#x27;s edicts. Guise lashed out at Coligny, saying to those present, were it not for the dignity of the court, he would have stabbed Coligny.

==Reign of Charles IX==
===Early reign===
====Estates General====
The estates began their deliberations on the packages proposed by the government in December. Coligny, in attendance, faced criticism for his recent proposals at the Assembly of Notables, with one delegate rising to say that the king ought to punish those who had presented the petition to him about Protestant rights to worship. Coligny, outraged at this attack protested to the king and Catherine, and shortly thereafter the speaker apologised, asserting he had of course, not meant the Admiral. The situation at court was much changed from the Guise regime, with Montmorency returning to the centre, and the Guise influence on the wane. Despite this decline in Guise fortunes, Catherine was not inclined to elevate the Montmorency or Châtillon to the place that they had filled, preferring to balance the various noble houses.

====Growth in influence====
Coligny found himself at the centre of Protestant hopes for the new administration, a new petition being brought through him to Catherine asking for permission for Protestant services to be held in private houses, it would however be rejected. Coligny increased in confidence in his new religion in the coming year, his son being baptised in the Protestant fashion in February 1561. Some time early in the year he also appointed a Protestant minister to his household. At the same time as he was becoming more openly Protestant, his political fortunes rose with Catherine&#x27;s regency. On 15 March the estates of the Prévóté of Paris were recommending him to be the supervisor of the young king&#x27;s education. In the same month he was admitted into the &quot;Conseil des Affairs&quot; where royal policy was formulated.

====Overextension====
On 1 April, Palm Sunday, Coligny hosted in his apartments a large Protestant service, throwing open his doors. In attendance was Condé with a large retinue, among other nobles. This aroused the disgust of Montmorency and Guise who protested to Catherine. Both she, and the Constable would reprimand Coligny for this audacious move. A few days later there would be further outrage, when, on Easter Sunday, Montmorency and Guise learned that Jean de Monluc would be giving the sermon. Tiring of hearing critiques of their cherished practices the two descended into the servants quarters to hear an obscure friar instead. Delighted at this reconciliation between the two bitter rivals, Cardinal Tournon oversaw the kiss of peace between the two grandees. Montmorency warned Coligny there could be no repeat of the events of Palm Sunday. In the subsequent days, both left court with their retinues, leaving Catherine and Coligny isolated.

====Toleration====
Coligny&#x27;s support for Catherine&#x27;s regency delivered fruit when the prorogued estates provided their consent to her governance in September 1561. Coligny initially held out hope for the success of the Colloquy of Poissy that met to discuss the religious question in the same month. However, he found himself frustrated by the intractability of both sides, covering his face when Beza remarked that the body of Christ was as far from the sacrament bread as heaven was from earth. While Navarre, Lorraine and the queen regent were trying to push a compromise to the religious question through the Confession of Augsburg in October, Coligny played little part. Throughout late 1561, Coligny continued to lobby the crown for the allowance of public worship. All the while he, and other Protestants at courts continued to attend Calvinist service. In the final weeks of 1561, Coligny&#x27;s brother Andelot was invited into the &quot;Conseil des Affairs&quot; further heightening the Protestant character of the government. This was followed, in mid January 1562 later by the seismic Edict of Saint-Germain which legalised on at least a temporary basis public Protestant worship under certain conditions across the kingdom. Synods and consistories would also be legal under royal supervision. Such an edict was the culmination of what Coligny had been pushing for throughout 1561. In early 1562 Coligny again tried to support a colonial venture, this time the colony of Fort Caroline in Spanish Florida led by Jean Ribault, it would prove a failure.

====Road to civil war====
The edict of Saint-Germain was the final straw for the lieutenant general, Navarre, who broke with the regency and urged Guise to hurry back so they could represent a united front against Catherine&#x27;s policy. Having lost Navarre, Catherine&#x27;s government was left with only the Châtillons and Condé as a basis for support. Conscious of the increasing hostility, Coligny in turn withdrew from court to his estates on 22 February, abandoning Catherine. On his way back to Paris, the Duke of Guise&#x27;s men were responsible for a massacre at the town of Wassy. Arriving in Paris on 16 March to a heroes welcome for his deeds, Condé heavily outnumbered in the city by the dukes men, would depart on 23 March. The prince headed to Orléans, where, on 2 April he raised the standard of rebellion, seizing the city and issuing a manifesto denouncing the &#x27;imprisonment of the king&#x27;. Coligny had linked up with him several days prior, their forces conjoining at Meaux on 27 March. He wrote to Catherine at this time, defending the arming of his men as being customary for a gentleman, and suggested they were necessary due to &#x27;Guise&#x27;s designs against him.&#x27;

===First War===
====Momentum====
With the outbreak of civil war, many cities across France rose up and declared themselves for Condé&#x27;s cause. These included Rouen, Tours, Blois, Lyon. During the initial months of conflict, the crown was caught on the back foot, and much negotiations followed in the coming months. Coligny defended his support of the rebellion in letters to both Catherine and his uncle Montmorency, castigating the Constable for allying himself with his families enemy, the Guise. By June the royal army was ready to take the offensive, their main force marching on Orléans, causing Condé to disperse his troops to avoid them being pinned down in a siege. With the threat on the capital removed and Blois recently retaken, the royal army dispersed flying columns to clear the area around Paris. The main force marched on Bourges, quickly reducing it in early September. Condé and Coligny meanwhile, had been negotiating the Treaty of Hampton Court (1562) with Queen Elizabeth; which offered Le Havre to the queen, in return for military support. Coligny&#x27;s knowledge of this particular term of the treaty is a matter of scholarly debate. Condé and Coligny created a shadow state, assigning Soubise as governor of Lyonnais and Saint-Gemne as governor of Poitiers among others.

====Rouen====
News of these negotiations persuaded the royal army to move north into Normandy, to seize the critical town of Rouen from the rebels. Meanwhile Coligny&#x27;s brother Andelot was in Germany, raising a force of mercenaries to return Condé&#x27;s force to numerical parity with that of the crown. On returning into France, he outmanoeuvred the attempts of Saint André to intercept him, linking up with Coligny and Condé in Orléans. The main royal force meanwhile succeeded in reducing Rouen after a length siege, though at the cost of their overall nominal commander Navarre who was wounded, and died on his way back to Paris.

====Dreux====
Condé now advocated for marching on Paris, hoping a decisive thrust at the capital could turn the tide of the war. Coligny meanwhile proposed marching their forces up into Normandy, reclaiming the lost towns there, and receiving the money they were owed by Elizabeth to keep their troops paid. As overall commander Condé took the army on a march south, the royal army shadowed their approach, and after some delays, pushed them north into Normandy, where the two sides met at the major pitch battle of the war Dreux. The battle would be bloody for both sides, with both Condé and Montmorency being captured at various stages, and Saint-André slain. Guise would lead the crown to victory but Coligny would be able to lead the cavalry off the field in a successful retreat back to Orléans. Through January Coligny begged Elizabeth to provide the promised infantry and money in repeated letters to little effect.

====Normandy====
Leaving Andelot in charge of Orléans as Guise moved in to besiege the city, Coligny marched north with some of the remaining forces at their disposal to seize back Normandy. Finally able to secure 8000 crowns from his English allies to pay his mutinous troops, he captured first Caen and then Bayeux while the only royal forces in the region were tied down sieging Le Havre. Soon though peace, negotiated by the captive Condé and Montmorency was declared.

===Long peace===
====Feud====
As the siege of Orléans reached its climax in early 1563, with reports that Guise&#x27;s victory was imminent, the Protestant assassin Poltrot de Méré infiltrated the dukes camp, and fatally wounded him. As Guise died, so too did the momentum of the siege. Poltrot would be caught, and under torture implicated Coligny, his story evolving and shifting between tortures, occasionally denying Coligny&#x27;s involvement. Coligny, up in Normandy, learnt of the Dukes death on 28 February, but did not find out about Poltrots accusations for some further days. On 12 March he demanded a chance to cross examine Poltrot, to disprove these accusations. However Poltrot was hurriedly executed on 18 March, so that he would not be covered by the amnesty featured in the Edict of Amboise.

Poltrots testimony would inflame the Guise who angrily called for vengeance. Condé and Montmorency defended Coligny at council on 15 May. With the support of the Montmorency, the old power struggle between Guise and Montmorency was sparked once more. The Guise family planned an offensive against Coligny, launching a private suit on 26 April 1563. To ensure an appropriately partisan judge was chosen to manage the suit, the family brought a large retinue to pressure the Paris Parlement into selecting appropriately. This victory against Coligny would be short lived, as the king evoked the case to the royal council, denying the Parlement jurisdiction. Shortly thereafter the council suspended judgement until the king came of age, and ordered both parties to suspend their hostilities. In November, Coligny responded in kind, entering Paris in force with a large host of his supporters. Fearing the two sides might come to blows Catherine summoned both to the Louvre on 6 December to try and calm things down. Throughout December however there would be isolated acts of violence perpetrated by both sides. At last on 5 January 1564 the king took more definitive action, suspending judgement on the case for a further 3 years in a crushing blow to the Guise.

Seeing their fortunes ebb the Guise took a new approach to their feud, trying to build a non confessional base of support, bringing Condé on side against the &#x27;upstart&#x27; Montmorency. With him on side, the Guise planned a triumphal entry in force to Paris, which under its governor Francois de Montmorency was a Montmorency powerbase. Ignoring his insistence that arms were not allowed in the city, Lorraine and the young Henry, Duke of Guise entered in force; their retinue clashing with that of the Montmorency in a bloody failure. Humiliated Lorraine and Guise retreated to their residence, where they were taunted even by Catholic Parisians.

In early January 1566 Lorraine travelled to the court at Moulins to appeal for proceedings against Coligny, characterising himself as a defender of the princes against this house that was the son of a baron. The princes at court voted against Lorraine&#x27;s motion, and the crown was able to compel Lorraine and Coligny to exchange the kiss of peace. This was confirmed in a declaration of Coligny&#x27;s innocence established in edict on 29 January 1566.

====Peace====
Coligny took no part in the negotiations of the Edict of Amboise, and blamed Condé for failing to achieve a settlement that took advantage of what he felt was their advantageous position. He would remain largely uninvolved in the interpretative declarations that modified the peace over the next several years. He turned his attention to international enterprises, first concerning the colonial project in Florida, and then commercial activity in the North Sea. These enterprises would come to little. Having largely been absent from court over the prior years, Coligny began to appear there more frequently from 1566. In 1566 Francisque and André d&#x27;Albaigne submitted to Coligny projects for establishing relations with the Austral lands. Although he gave favourable consideration to these initiatives, they came to naught.

====Meaux====
Tensions between the leading Huguenots and the crown escalated in 1567 as a result of several key factors. Firstly the modifications to the edict of Amboise, which in 1567 included an expansion of the prohibition on Protestantism from Paris to the Île-de-France region. The main impetus would however be Spain. Rumours had been swirling in Huguenot circles that Alba&#x27;s meeting with Catherine in 1566 during the royal tour, had not in fact been to discuss marriage proposals, but in fact, to plot the destruction of French Huguenots. When news reached the court that Alba was marching north along the Spanish Road to crush a Protestant uprising in the Spanish Netherlands Huguenots and Catholics alike were alarmed. The crown decided to hire 6000 Swiss to protect the country, in case Alba turned his army on the kingdom. However, the Protestant nobles claimed these Swiss were to be used in conjunction with Alba&#x27;s forces for the genocidal operation. Coligny, having been passed over in favour of Filippo di Piero Strozzi to lead the mercenaries, joined Condé in leaving court.

Meeting away from court, the leading Protestant nobles minds turned to conspiracy. At a conference at Coligny&#x27;s chateau, in which Condé, the Coligny brothers, Rochefoucauld and other leading nobles were present Andelot argued strongly for taking military action. Coligny meanwhile championed the path of caution, but was eventually won over by the much larger war party. With a direction agreed, the conference turned to planning specifics, with risings to take place in each &quot;baillage&quot;, the king to be seized at Meaux and Lorraine to be killed.

While the plan would be a better kept secret than Amboise, word would eventually leak out, and the court, having heard of cavalry being assembled in the nearby villages, made a plan to head for Paris in the night quickly. Caught off guard by this sudden withdrawal Condé and Coligny pursued with only a third of the cavalry they had intended to bring, thrice charging at the phalanxes of Swiss that guarded the king as he fled, never able to break their line, forcing them to retreat. The king was safe, if furious in Paris, and the rebels were left with a dilemma of how to proceed.

===Second War===
====Paris====
Hoping not to waste the initiative of the attack, Condé decided to starve Paris into submission, hoping he could capture the king in this more involved fashion. The rebels quickly captured several strategic points around Paris from Charenton-le-Pont to Argenteuil to tighten his grip on the capital. Confident in his position, he negotiated with the crown aggressively, demanding the repeal of all taxes established since the time of Louis XII the expulsion of all Italian financiers and the free exercise of religion. The crown was uninterested in these terms, and began assembling its forces in the city to break out. Coligny and La Noue were sent by Condé to intercept recruits from Savoy coming north under the command of Strozzi this would however be a failure and Strozzi would arrive near Paris in October. Meanwhile Condé, not appreciating the increasing danger he was in, sent Coligny&#x27;s brother Andelot with troops to seize the town of Poissy and Montgomery to take the town of Pontoise. His sieging force thus further weakened Montmorency chose the moment to strike out of Paris.

====Saint Denis====
By now Coligny had at least returned to the main body, and at the Battle of Saint Denis took responsibility for the right flank of Condé&#x27;s army while his lieutenant, Genlis, handled the left. Condé&#x27;s heavy cavalry was torn into by the experienced Swiss troops, but his cavalry had more success against Montmorency&#x27;s inexperienced Parisian levies, exposing Montmorency&#x27;s position. Condé was unhorsed and had to be taken from the field. Montmorency meanwhile was shot by Robert Stuart. The Swiss would win the day for the crown, and although casualties were fairly low for either side, Condé, whose forces had been smaller to begin with, withdrew eastwards towards the border.

====Chartres====
The crown followed, hoping the rebel army would disintegrate without the need for another engagement. Condé and Coligny were however able to keep it together, uniting with the mercenaries, and upon their re-entry to France, more troops from the south. Emboldened once more, Condė decided to besiege Chartres, hoping it would be a rich and symbolic prize for his troops. Condé would however, set up the rebel guns poorly, and the siege would drag on. Before it could conclude however, both sides came to truce on 13 March and then formal peace with the Peace of Longjumeau.

===Short peace===
====Longjumeau====

Coligny, Andelot and Charles de Téligny were the prime negotiators of Longjumeau for the rebels. They were not however able to achieve much more than Condé had at Amboise years previously despite Coligny&#x27;s denunciations of that peace. The terms largely repeated those of the prior edict, but it was nominally intended as a permanent peace in contrast to the provisional nature of Amboise&#x27;s terms. Much of the militant Catholic population reacted with disgust to the peace, with riots in Rouen, Toulouse and Orléans. In the south both sides would flout the peace openly, with the Huguenot populations of Castres and Montpellier refusing entry to their returning royal garrison. Several armies of the crown, including that of Guillaume de Joyeuse and Sommerive maintained presence in the field, capturing towns and besting Huguenot commanders in battle.

====Frustration====
Coligny was frustrated at what he felt was the crowns failure to abide by the peace. He wrote to Catherine in June to complain about various outrages and violations. Characterising it as an attack on the monarchy through disregard for its edicts he also mentioned assassination plots against his person. Catherine dismissed these concerns, writing back that he had no reason to be frightened, and encouraging him to live in obedience to the king as he had the king&#x27;s father and grandfather. When in July six masked men gunned down the lieutenant of Andelot&#x27;s ordinance company, Coligny wrote bitterly to the king. In his letter he complained about his suspicions that not only was the attack orchestrated by the Confraternity of the Holy Ghost, but that therefore the provincial governors and the king had given tacit consent due to their cooperation with the various leagues.

====Saint-Maur====

Meanwhile the mood on the court was fast changing, with Hôpital out of favour, the moderates who had negotiated the peace began to be dominated by Catherine&#x27;s new Italian favourites. This was compounded with the return of Lorraine. When, in search of financial relief for the kingdom, Pius V was approached. He proposed he would rescue the kingdoms finances in return for a war against heresy from the government. With decision made to overturn the peace. In early September the leading Huguenot aristocrats, including Coligny, were warned of a plot to arrest them by Tavannes who felt the process dishonourable. As a result, Coligny, Condé and the other aristocrats fled south in haste, arriving in the Protestant stronghold of La Rochelle on 18 September, and taking up arms. The crown meanwhile established the Edict of Saint-Maur outlawing Protestantism in the kingdom. On 8 October Anjou took the field.

===Third War===
====Jarnac====
Conscious both of their more precarious position, and the failure of their prior campaigns to achieve decisive success Condé and Coligny took a new approach to the conflict they faced. Instead of hinging around the Loire, they would operate out of the Huguenot heartlands in the south, fortifying towns such as Angoulême and Cognac. As they moved south in early 1569, the army under the nominal command of Anjou caught their rear-guard, led by Condė while crossing a river. He would be captured, and while under armed guard without weapons, executed. Despite this heavy strategic blow to the rebel cause, the loss of the prince of the blood. Coligny was able to hold the rest of the army together, and withdraw in good order with only minimal casualties. While the young Navarre and Condé would inherit nominal command of the cause; their young age meant Coligny would be the de facto military leader. In May 1569 Coligny&#x27;s brother Andelot would die of an illness on campaign.

====La Roche l&#x27;Abeille====

To revitalise his army, Coligny sought, and was able to achieve juncture between his forces and those of his German ally the duke of Zweibrücken and he turned to attack the smaller army under Strozzi, defeating him at the Battle of La Roche-l&#x27;Abeille. With confidence restored through this battle, Coligny settled in to besiege Poitiers where the young Henry, Duke of Guise had rushed on news of his approach to reinforce the weak garrison. After many heavy bombardments a breach was created, the siege appeared close to victory for Coligny, however the garrison was able to repulse the assaults through it, and Coligny lifted the siege on 7 September. On 12 September the Parlement of Paris declared Coligny a traitor, forfeited his titles and property and further put a price of 50,000 écus on his head.

====Paris====
Soon after the failures of the siege the rebels were dealt a far more devastating blow than Jarnac at the Battle of Moncontour. During the course of the battle Coligny received a pistol shot to the face and while he survived he had to withdraw from the field. The loss of their leader left the army confused and directionless, dooming it. While the Huguenot army was savaged in the battle, it was not entirely annihilated and most of the cavalry was able to withdraw. Battle won Anjou led the royal army to besiege Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angely, the siege would prove a disaster for the royal army, consuming it in famine and disease. Coligny meanwhile regrouped what forces he had left, united with the Viscounts of Languedoc and began a circuitous march towards Paris. Coligny marched from Nîmes into Burgundy, sacking the great Abbey of Cluny in June. Having bested a force under Cossé at Arney-le-Duc. he avoided the royal army at Autun, picked up further reinforcements at Sancerre and moved directly on Paris. This march would achieve its intended affect, and peace would be declared on favourable terms.

====Peace====
Negotiations had been seriously ongoing between Coligny, Jeanne d&#x27;Albret and the crown since December 1569. There had been difficult over matters of public worship, which towns the rebels would receive as security. Eventually it was agreed that Protestantism would be tolerated on the model of the Edict of January, and that the Huguenots would receive Montauban, La Charité sur Loire, La Rochelle and Cognac as surety for two years. While Coligny had considerable influence on these terms it was not as total as Condé&#x27;s had been for Amboise. Instead he, Albret and a council of nobles voted on agreement for the various terms. The bounty on Coligny&#x27;s head was to be revoked, and he was to be restored to his office as Admiral, with all his property returned.

===Saint Bartholomew===
====Prelude====
In 1571 Coligny married Jacqueline de Montbel d&#x27;Entremont. For much of late 1570 and 1571, he remained wary of returning to court, little trusting the offers of safety provided to him by the king. Instead he kept himself south in La Rochelle, Both the king of Spain and the Duke of Savoy were convinced he was plotting against them from the city, his marriage to de Montbel d&#x27;Entremont only further convincing Savoy, due to her being an heiress in the kingdom. He found himself compelled to return in September 1571 however, in hopes of convincing the court of his plan to invade the Spanish Netherlands, with a cross-faith army led by Charles personally. Uniting the French against the real enemy, the Habsburgs. This plan appealed greatly to Charles, and he grew rapidly in favour with the young, impressionable king. He would not however stay at court long, and, failing to convince the council of his plans, he would withdraw after 5 weeks again to his estates. Henry, Duke of Guise, spent his time lobbying the court to re-open the investigation into the assassination of his father, but, as with Coligny, the council voted him down.

From December 1571 to May 1572 Coligny was again absent from court. Suspicious of the prospect of the Navarre-Valois marriage, one of the key components of the 1570 peace, Catherine pushed him into acceptance on the issue, both by presenting him the possibility of a war with Spain, and by implying it was necessary for him to be on good terms with the king. In the furore that accompanied attempts to remove the Gastines Cross from Paris in 1571 in line with the 1570 peace. Coligny seemed fairly unbothered by whether the memorial was removed or not. Increasingly he was consumed in the construction of an anti-Spanish alliance, hoping to bring in a large coalition from the German princes to the Ottoman Empire to bring down Spain. French rapprochement with England in April 1572, in the Treaty of Blois (1572) seemed a major step towards the anti-Spanish alliance Coligny dreamed of. Yet once again he would run against the near unanimous opposition of the royal council to his plans.

The fiasco of the Genlis expedition, which in July had crossed the border with 4000 infantry only to be crushed and slaughtered by Spanish troops, only worsened the outlook for Coligny&#x27;s plans. The involvement of Coligny and even the king&#x27;s secret consent to the expedition of Genlis as a method of testing the water with Spain is a matter of debate.

====Assassination attempt====
Coligny returned to Paris after a stay at his estates for the Navarre Valois marriage. His attendance at this event was critical, as it represented a key component of the reconciliation between Catholic and Huguenot factions. After the wedding was concluded, Coligny stayed in the capital for several days, hoping to resolve several matters with the king of violations of the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Leaving a mass for Marguerite on 22 August Coligny noticed the Huguenot banners lost at Moncontour hanging from the Notre-Dame, and commented that he felt those should be taken down and placed somewhere more appropriate to their honour. The same day after the end of the wedding festivities, Coligny was shot in the street on his way back to his residence, likely by a man called Maurevert from the top floor of a house. However, due to him bending down to tie his shoe the bullets only tore a finger from his right hand and shattered his left elbow. The would-be assassin escaped.

No contemporary investigation would be conducted into responsibility due to the events of the subsequent days. Historians have taken many positions on the matter. Some have argued Catherine de&#x27; Medici, jealous of Coligny&#x27;s influence over the young king and fearful of his plans for war with Spain orchestrated the assassination. Others have attacked this notion, arguing she was seeking internal peace in this period and this worked against her interests, proposing instead the Guise, trying to satisfy their long running vendetta arranged the attack. Supporters of this argument highlight the house Maurevert was in was owned by Guise. Still others have argued in favour of the Parlement of Paris, the Duke of Anjou, de Retz, Philip II of Spain, the Duke of Alba and Maurevert working independently to satisfy a personal grudge.

The King sent his own physician to treat Coligny and even visited him. Coligny meanwhile, furiously petitioned the king to investigate who had shot him. The king promised to look into the matter and bring all perpetrators to justice. Senior Protestant nobles such as Téligny and Rochefoucauld began making dark threats to the court about taking revenge on those they suspected of being the perpetrators. Coligny meanwhile, though not joining in this talk, elected to stay in the city against the advice of many of his allies.

====Massacre====

The Catholics now feared Huguenot retaliation for the attempt on Coligny&#x27;s life, a fear only compounded by the 4000 troops Téligny had stationed outside the city. It was decided over the course of three council meetings on 23 August to pre-emptively assassinate their leadership, in what became known as the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. The original proposer of the plan is unknown, but consent on the council from Catherine, the king, Retz, Nevers, Guise, Anjou was unanimous on the course of action. In the final meeting, at midnight, Guise, Aumale, Angoulême, Anjou and Montpensier drew up the kill lists and divided responsibility among themselves. Guise would strike at Coligny, before crossing to the left bank and taking out targets in the faubourg Saint-Germain. Montpensier would handle targets in the Louvre, including Navarre and Condé, who would be compelled to convert.

In the early hours of the 24th, Guise&#x27;s men mustered at the Hôtel d&#x27;Aumale. In total he had 60 men, including his uncle Aumale, and Anjou. Just before dawn they struck at Coligny&#x27;s residence, Anjou&#x27;s guards having withdrawn from the house to afford them access. Coligny ordered his household to escape across the roof. First to burst into his chambers was Johann von Janowitz who remarked &quot;Oh Admiral, Admiral, You sleep too deeply... Are you not the Admiral?&quot; Coligny retorted &quot;Yes I am him, But you are too young a soldier to speak thus to an old captain. At least have respect for my age.&quot; Before being pushed from the window the final words Coligny heard were &quot;I am old enough to put you to rest.&quot;

Having fallen into the courtyard, what happened next is a matter of debate. Some Protestant contemporaries claim after pushing his boot into his foe&#x27;s head, Guise arranged for the head to be severed and taken to Catherine, who embalmed it and sent it to the Pope. However, a Protestant eyewitness to what unfolded asserted that Guise did not dismount his horse. Having satisfied himself that Coligny was dead, he and his company left the corpse and went on to their next target. As the massacre proper began, the militant mob then cut off the genitals, head and hands and dragged the body around for the following days as they had done to a model of Coligny years prior. Over the next few hours a general massacre would develop, fomented by the city militia and radicals among the population. It would consume first Paris, and then spread to various other cities around France.
Coligny&#x27;s papers were seized and burned by the queen mother; among them, according to Brantôme, was a history of the civil war, &quot;very fair and well-written, and worthy of publication&quot;.

==Marriages and issue==
By his first wife, Charlotte de Laval (1530–1568), Gaspard had:
* Louise, who married first Charles de Téligny and afterwards William the Silent, Prince of Orange;
* François, Admiral of Guienne, who was one of the devoted servants of Henry IV (Gaspard de Coligny (1584–1646), son of this François, was Marshal of France during the reign of Louis XIII); and
* Charles (1564–1632), Marquis d&#x27;Andelot, a Lieutenant General in Champagne.

By his second wife, Jacqueline de Montbel d&#x27;Entremont (1541–1588), the Countess d&#x27;Entremont and Launay-Gelin, Gaspard had one daughter:
*Béatrix, who became Beatrice de Coligny (born 1572), Countess d&#x27;Entremont by marriage to Claude-Antoine d&#x27;Albon de Montauban de Meuillon d&#x27;Entremont. Their son, Philippe-Mius, would settle Acadia and found the settlement of Pubnico, one of the last remaining francophone communities in Nova Scotia.

==Legacy==
Several places are named after de Coligny:
* Coligny, South Africa
* Fort Coligny, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
* Châtillon-Coligny, in France
* Coligny Plaza, Hilton Head Island
* Coligni (misspelled) Avenue, New Rochelle, New York

<doc id="313771" wikidata="Q1344080" url="?curid=313771" title="Jaleco">
<text>was a corporate brand name that was used by two previously connected video game developers and publishers based in Japan. The original Jaleco company was founded in 1974 as Japan Leisure Company, founded by Yoshiaki Kanazawa, before being renamed to simply Jaleco in the early 1980s. This company was later acquired in 2000 by PCCW, who rebranded it as their Japanese game division, PCCW Japan, before reverting it to Jaleco in 2002. In 2006, Jaleco became independent from PCCW and renamed to Jaleco Holding, having their video game operations spun off into a new company, also called Jaleco. This new spin-off company was sold to mobile developer Game Yarou in 2009, with Jaleco Holding renaming itself to Encom Holdings shortly after.

Jaleco is known for its arcade and home console video games produced in the 1980s and early 1990s, including &quot;City Connection&quot;, &quot;Bases Loaded&quot;, &quot;Ninja JaJaMaru-kun&quot;, &quot;Exerion&quot;, &quot;Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai&quot; and &quot;Rushing Beat&quot;. Jaleco also produced arcade cabinets for other game developers, alongside redemption arcade games and UFO catcher claw machines. In the past, the company produced amusement park equipment and aquarium parts, under their JAQNO brand name. Their North American division, Jaleco USA, published a number of titles for the NES and SNES, including &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, &quot;Pinball Quest&quot; and &quot;R-Type III&quot;.

In 2014, Jaleco&#x27;s parent company Game Yarou filed for bankruptcy, causing Jaleco to vanish from the video game industry. The company&#x27;s video game assets would be purchased by City Connection, an indie Japanese studio that continues to use their games for other side projects and licensing deals (the company itself being named after one of Jaleco&#x27;s games). The original Jaleco company, Encom Holdings, quit the video game business in 2009, citing stiff competition in the industry, instead dealing in real estate. Encom dissolved in 2013, and was delisted from the JASDAQ that same year.

==History==

Jaleco was founded by Japanese businessman Yoshiaki Kanazawa on October 3, 1974. They were originally known as the , producing equipment for both amusement parks and arcade centers across Japan. The company was originally based out of Setagaya-ku, Tokyo.

Japan Leisure began production of arcade video games by 1982, and changed their corporate name to Jaleco, taking the first two letters of each word of &quot;Japan Leisure Co.&quot;, in March 1983. Jaleco began production of home console video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan. Towards the mid-1980s, Jaleco would begin production of equipment for aquarium tanks, which were released under their JAQNO brand name. A North American office, Jaleco USA, operated in Northbrook, Illinois. This division sometimes published other third-party video games for both the NES and SNES consoles, notably &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and &quot;R-Type III&quot;, alongside distribution of Jaleco video games in the United States.

By 2000, Jaleco was struggling financially, being unable to produce a hit video game in several years. To keep the company afloat, Jaleco was acquired by Hong Kong-based company PCCW on November 1, 2000, where they became the Japanese division of the company, renamed to PCCW Japan. Heavy company restructuring was performing, with Jaleco&#x27;s arcade division shuttering in April 2001 while retaining their home console video game division. In April 2001, PCCW Japan purchased the VR-1 Group, the holder of North American MMO developer VR-1 Entertainment, in order to have their operations expand globally. In October 2002, PCCW Japan merged Jaleco USA and VR-1 Entertainment into a new company, Jaleco Entertainment, relocating to Buffalo, New York. PCCW Japan was renamed back to Jaleco in 2004. They would continue to operate for several years as a subsidiary of PCCW, producing video games for home consoles and Japanese mobile phones, alongside soundtrack albums and applications for web browsers.
In August 2005, PCCW sold off Jaleco to Sandringham Fund SPC, alongside the subsidiary company Hyperlink Investments Group. On May 31, 2006, Jaleco&#x27;s board of directors () announced that the company would be renamed to Jaleco Holding and become an holding company effective on July 3. On that same date, the video game operations would spun-off into a new company known as Jaleco, which would become a subsidiary of Jaleco Holding. The corporate restructure was done to reflect the company&#x27;s diversified portfolio which no longer limited to video games and included activities such as real estate and financial services. In October 2007, Hyperlink Investments Group sold its stock in Jaleco Holding to Game Yarou, a Japanese mobile phone developer, and two South Korean corporations, STIC Pioneer Fund and A2i. Jaleco Holdings dissolved two subsidiary companies, FFBC Investment and J Consulting, in early 2008. Jaleco&#x27;s North American division, Jaleco Entertainment, closed their doors later that year.

On January 15, 2009, Jaleco Holding sold off Jaleco to Game Yarou for a total of ¥1 (US$0.01); however, Game Yarou soon assumed ¥700,000,000 ($7.736 million) of Jaleco Holding&#x27;s ¥16,000,000,000 ($17.68 million) loan. A spokesperson for Jaleco Holding cited &quot;increasing competition in recent years in the video game market&quot; as the reason for the company&#x27;s retirement in the industry, which was proving to be difficult for the company to stay afloat. Under ownership from Game Yarou, Jaleco produced video games for Japanese mobile phones and web browsers, alongside licensing many of their older video games to third-party developers for use in other projects. On March 2, 2009, Jaleco announced that it would release a video game for the Wii, &quot;Ougon no Kizuna&quot;, on May 28 of that year.

By 2012, Game Yarou was in a financial crisis due to high debt and poor sales of their mobile titles – they were officially declared bankrupt by the Tokyo District Court on May 21, 2014. Jaleco would soon vanish from the video game industry, with their video games being acquired later that year by Japanese company City Connection, formerly known as Clarice Disk. The company continues to use Jaleco video games for a number of projects, alongside licensing them out to other developers for use in other products. Jaleco Holding renamed itself to Encom Holdings in April 2009, focusing on real estate and finance business in Japan and no longer being involved with video games. Encom Holdings dissolved on May 13, 2013, and was delisted from the JASDAQ that same day, due to poor reputation and loss of income.

<text>The Virginia Capes are the two capes, Cape Charles to the north and Cape Henry to the south, that define the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay on the eastern coast of North America.

The importance of the Chesapeake Bay in American history has long made the Virginia Capes strategically significant, most notably in the naval Battle of the Chesapeake that was crucial to the American victory at the siege of Yorktown, effectively ending the American Revolutionary War. As a result, the area was heavily garrisoned, beginning with the construction of Fort Monroe and Fort Wool in 1819. During the American Civil War, a pivotal battle between the ironclad warships and was fought in Hampton Roads. The &quot;Virginia&quot; was attempting to break the Union blockade that was strangling the Confederacy.

During World War I, additional gun batteries were installed on Cape Henry at Fort Story and on Fisherman&#x27;s Island near Cape Charles. During World War II, the coast artillery batteries at Fort Story were expanded and additional batteries were installed at Fort John Custis on Cape Charles to guard the entrance to Hampton Roads Harbor.

More recently, because of the close proximity of many military installations, including Naval Station Norfolk, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek–Fort Story, NAS Oceana, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and Newport News Shipbuilding, the Capes area has often been used for the initial trials of new Navy ships and for military training exercises.

<text>Quantum chaos is a branch of physics focused on how chaotic classical dynamical systems can be described in terms of quantum theory. The primary question that quantum chaos seeks to answer is: &quot;What is the relationship between quantum mechanics and classical chaos?&quot; The correspondence principle states that classical mechanics is the classical limit of quantum mechanics, specifically in the limit as the ratio of the Planck constant to the action of the system tends to zero. If this is true, then there must be quantum mechanisms underlying classical chaos (although this may not be a fruitful way of examining classical chaos). If quantum mechanics does not demonstrate an exponential sensitivity to initial conditions, how can exponential sensitivity to initial conditions arise in classical chaos, which must be the correspondence principle limit of quantum mechanics?

In seeking to address the basic question of quantum chaos, several approaches have been employed:
# Development of methods for solving quantum problems where the perturbation cannot be considered small in perturbation theory and where quantum numbers are large.
# Correlating statistical descriptions of eigenvalues (energy levels) with the classical behavior of the same Hamiltonian (system).
# Study of probability distribution of individual eigenstates (see scars and quantum ergodicity).
# Semiclassical methods such as periodic-orbit theory connecting the classical trajectories of the dynamical system with quantum features.
# Direct application of the correspondence principle.

== History ==
During the first half of the twentieth century, chaotic behavior in mechanics was recognized (as in the three-body problem in celestial mechanics), but not well understood. The foundations of modern quantum mechanics were laid in that period, essentially leaving aside the issue of the quantum-classical correspondence in systems whose classical limit exhibit chaos.

== Approaches ==
Questions related to the correspondence principle arise in many different branches of physics, ranging from nuclear to atomic, molecular and solid-state physics, and even to acoustics, microwaves and optics. However, classical-quantum correspondence in chaos theory is not always possible. Thus, some versions of the classical butterfly effect do not have counterparts in quantum mechanics.

Important observations often associated with classically chaotic quantum systems are spectral level repulsion, dynamical localization in time evolution (e.g. ionization rates of atoms), and enhanced stationary wave intensities in regions of space where classical dynamics exhibits only unstable trajectories (as in scattering). In the semiclassical approach of quantum chaos, phenomena are identified in spectroscopy by analyzing the statistical distribution of spectral lines and by connecting spectral periodicities with classical orbits. Other phenomena show up in the time evolution of a quantum system, or in its response to various types of external forces. In some contexts, such as acoustics or microwaves, wave patterns are directly observable and exhibit irregular amplitude distributions.

Quantum chaos typically deals with systems whose properties need to be calculated using either numerical techniques or approximation schemes (see e.g. Dyson series). Simple and exact solutions are precluded by the fact that the system&#x27;s constituents either influence each other in a complex way, or depend on temporally varying external forces.

== Quantum mechanics in non-perturbative regimes ==
For conservative systems, the goal of quantum mechanics in non-perturbative regimes is to find
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian of the form
: formula_1
where formula_2 is separable in some coordinate system, formula_3 is non-separable in the coordinate system in which formula_4 is separated, and formula_5 is a parameter which cannot be considered small. Physicists have historically approached problems of this nature by trying to find the coordinate system in which the non-separable Hamiltonian is smallest and then treating the non-separable Hamiltonian as a perturbation.

Finding constants of motion so that this separation can be performed can be a difficult (sometimes impossible) analytical task. Solving the classical problem can give valuable insight into solving the quantum problem. If there are regular classical solutions of
the same Hamiltonian, then there are (at least) approximate constants of motion, and by solving the classical problem, we gain clues how to find them.

Other approaches have been developed in recent years. One is to express the Hamiltonian in 
different coordinate systems in different regions of space, minimizing the non-separable part of the Hamiltonian in each region. Wavefunctions are obtained in these regions, and eigenvalues are obtained by matching boundary conditions.

Another approach is numerical matrix diagonalization. If the Hamiltonian matrix is computed in any complete basis, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are obtained by diagonalizing the matrix. However, all complete basis sets are infinite, and we need to truncate the basis and still obtain accurate results. These techniques boil down to choosing a truncated basis from which accurate wavefunctions can be constructed. The computational time required to diagonalize a matrix scales as formula_6, where formula_7 is the dimension of the matrix, so it is important to choose the smallest basis possible from which the relevant wavefunctions can be constructed. It is also convenient to choose a basis in which the matrix is sparse and/or the matrix elements are given by simple algebraic expressions because computing matrix elements can also be a computational burden.

A given Hamiltonian shares the same constants of motion for both classical and quantum dynamics. Quantum systems can also have additional quantum numbers corresponding to discrete symmetries (such as parity conservation from reflection symmetry). However, if we merely find quantum solutions of a Hamiltonian which is not approachable by perturbation theory, we may learn a great deal about quantum solutions, but we have learned little about quantum chaos. Nevertheless, learning how to solve such quantum problems is an important part of answering the question of quantum chaos.

== Correlating statistical descriptions of quantum mechanics with classical behaviour ==
Statistical measures of quantum chaos were born out of a desire to quantify spectral features of complex systems. Random matrix theory was developed in an attempt to characterize spectra of complex nuclei. The remarkable result is that the statistical properties of many systems with unknown Hamiltonians can be predicted using random matrices of the proper symmetry class. Furthermore, random matrix theory also correctly predicts statistical properties of the eigenvalues of many chaotic systems with known Hamiltonians. This makes it useful as a tool for characterizing spectra which require large numerical efforts to compute.

A number of statistical measures are available for quantifying spectral features in a simple way. It is of great interest whether or not there are universal statistical behaviors of classically chaotic systems. The statistical tests mentioned here are universal, at least to systems with few degrees of freedom (Berry and Tabor have put forward strong arguments for a Poisson distribution in the case of regular motion and Heusler et al. present a semiclassical explanation of the so-called Bohigas–Giannoni–Schmit conjecture which asserts universality of spectral fluctuations in chaotic dynamics). The nearest-neighbor distribution (NND) of energy levels is relatively simple to interpret and it has been widely used to describe quantum chaos.

Qualitative observations of level repulsions can be quantified and related to the classical dynamics using the NND, which is believed to be an important signature of classical dynamics in quantum systems. It is thought that regular classical dynamics is manifested by a Poisson distribution of energy levels:
: formula_8
In addition, systems which display chaotic classical motion are expected to be characterized by the statistics of random matrix eigenvalue ensembles. For systems invariant under time reversal, the energy-level statistics of a number of chaotic systems have been shown to be in good agreement with the predictions of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) of random matrices, and it has been suggested that this phenomenon is generic for all chaotic systems with this symmetry. If the normalized spacing between two energy levels is formula_9, the normalized distribution of spacings is well approximated by
: formula_10

Many Hamiltonian systems which are classically integrable (non-chaotic) have been found to have quantum solutions that yield nearest neighbor distributions which follow the Poisson distributions. Similarly, many systems which exhibit classical chaos have been found with quantum solutions yielding a Wigner-Dyson distribution, thus supporting the ideas above. One notable exception is diamagnetic lithium which, though exhibiting classical chaos, demonstrates Wigner (chaotic) statistics for the even-parity energy levels and nearly Poisson (regular) statistics for the odd-parity energy level distribution.

== Semiclassical methods ==

=== Periodic orbit theory ===

Periodic-orbit theory gives a recipe for computing spectra from the periodic orbits of a system. In contrast to the Einstein–Brillouin–Keller method of action quantization, which applies only to integrable or near-integrable systems and computes individual eigenvalues from each trajectory, periodic-orbit theory is applicable to both integrable and non-integrable systems and asserts that each periodic orbit produces a sinusoidal fluctuation in the density of states.

The principal result of this development is an expression for the density of states which is the trace of the semiclassical Green&#x27;s function and is given by the Gutzwiller trace formula:
: formula_11

Recently there was a generalization of this formula for arbitrary matrix Hamiltonians that involves a Berry phase-like term stemming from spin or other internal degrees of freedom. The index formula_12 distinguishes the primitive periodic orbits: the shortest period orbits of a given set of initial conditions. formula_13 is the period of the primitive periodic orbit and formula_14 is its classical action. Each primitive orbit retraces itself, leading to a new orbit with action formula_15 and a period which is an integral multiple formula_16 of the primitive period. Hence, every repetition of a periodic orbit is another periodic orbit. These repetitions are separately classified by the intermediate sum over the indices formula_16. formula_18 is the orbit&#x27;s Maslov index.
The amplitude factor, formula_19, represents the square root of the density of neighboring orbits. Neighboring trajectories of an unstable periodic orbit diverge exponentially in time from the periodic orbit. The quantity formula_20 characterizes the instability of the orbit. A stable orbit moves on a torus in phase space, and neighboring trajectories wind around it. For stable orbits, formula_21 becomes formula_22, where formula_20 is the winding number of the periodic orbit. formula_24, where formula_25 is the number of times that neighboring orbits intersect the periodic orbit in one period. This presents a difficulty because formula_26 at a classical bifurcation. This causes that orbit&#x27;s contribution to the energy density to diverge. This also occurs in the context of photo-absorption spectrum.

Using the trace formula to compute a spectrum requires summing over all of the periodic orbits of a system. This presents several difficulties for chaotic systems: 1) The number of periodic orbits proliferates exponentially as a function of action. 2) There are an infinite number of periodic orbits, and the convergence properties of periodic-orbit theory are unknown. This difficulty is also present when applying periodic-orbit theory to regular systems. 3) Long-period orbits are difficult to compute because most trajectories are unstable and sensitive to roundoff errors and details of the numerical integration.

Gutzwiller applied the trace formula to approach the anisotropic Kepler problem (a single particle in a formula_27 potential with an anisotropic mass tensor) semiclassically. He found agreement with quantum computations for low lying (up to formula_28) states for small anisotropies by using only a small set of easily computed periodic orbits, but the agreement was poor for large anisotropies.

The figures above use an inverted approach to testing periodic-orbit theory. The trace formula asserts that each periodic orbit contributes a sinusoidal term to the spectrum. Rather than dealing with the computational difficulties surrounding long-period orbits to try to find the density of states (energy levels), one can use standard quantum mechanical perturbation theory to compute eigenvalues (energy levels) and use the Fourier transform to look for the periodic modulations of the spectrum which are the signature of periodic orbits. Interpreting the spectrum then amounts to finding the orbits which correspond to peaks in the Fourier transform.

==== Rough sketch on how to arrive at the Gutzwiller trace formula ====
# Start with the semiclassical approximation of the time-dependent Green&#x27;s function (the Van Vleck propagator).
# Realize that for caustics the description diverges and use the insight by Maslov (approximately Fourier transforming to momentum space (stationary phase approximation with h a small parameter) to avoid such points and afterwards transforming back to position space can cure such a divergence, however gives a phase factor). 
# Transform the Greens function to energy space to get the energy dependent Greens function (again approximate Fourier transform using the stationary phase approximation). New divergences might pop up that need to be cured using the same method as step 3
# Use formula_29 (tracing over positions) and calculate it again in stationary phase approximation to get an approximation for the density of states formula_30.
Note: Taking the trace tells you that only closed orbits contribute, the stationary phase approximation gives you restrictive conditions each time you make it. In step 4 it restricts you to orbits where initial and final momentum are the same i.e. periodic orbits. Often it is nice to choose a coordinate system parallel to the direction of movement, as it is done in many books.

=== Closed orbit theory ===

Closed-orbit theory was developed by J.B. Delos, M.L. Du, J. Gao, and J. Shaw. It is similar to
periodic-orbit theory, except that closed-orbit theory is applicable only to atomic and molecular spectra and yields the oscillator strength density (observable photo-absorption spectrum) from a specified initial state whereas periodic-orbit theory yields the density of states.

Only orbits that begin and end at the nucleus are important in closed-orbit theory. Physically, these are associated with the outgoing waves that are generated when a tightly bound electron is excited to a high-lying state. For Rydberg atoms and molecules, every orbit which is closed at the nucleus is also a periodic orbit whose period is equal to either the closure time or twice the closure time.

According to closed-orbit theory, the average oscillator strength density at constant formula_5 is given by a smooth background plus an oscillatory sum of the form
: formula_32
formula_33 is a phase that depends on the Maslov index and other details of the orbits. formula_34 is the recurrence amplitude of a closed orbit for a given initial state (labeled formula_35). It contains information about the stability of the orbit, its initial and final directions, and the matrix element of the dipole operator between the initial state and a zero-energy Coulomb wave. For scaling systems such as Rydberg atoms in strong fields, the Fourier transform of an oscillator strength spectrum computed at fixed formula_5 as a function of formula_37 is called a recurrence spectrum, because it gives peaks which correspond to the scaled action of closed orbits and whose heights correspond to formula_34.

Closed-orbit theory has found broad agreement with a number of chaotic systems, including diamagnetic hydrogen, hydrogen in parallel electric and magnetic fields, diamagnetic lithium, lithium in an electric field, the formula_39 ion in crossed and parallel electric and magnetic fields, barium in an electric field, and helium in an electric field.

=== One-dimensional systems and potential ===
For the case of one-dimensional system with the boundary condition formula_40 the density of states obtained from the Gutzwiller formula is related to the inverse of the potential of the classical system by formula_41 here formula_42 is the density of states and V(x) is the classical potential of the particle, the half derivative of the inverse of the potential is related to the density of states as in the Wu–Sprung potential.

== Recent directions ==
One open question remains understanding quantum chaos in systems that have finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces for which standard semiclassical limits do not apply. Recent works allowed for studying analytically such quantum many-body systems.

The traditional topics in quantum chaos concerns spectral statistics (universal and non-universal features), and the study of eigenfunctions of various chaotic Hamiltonian. For example, before the existence of scars was reported, eigenstates of a classically chaotic system were conjectured to fill the available phase space evenly, up to random fluctuations and energy conservation (Quantum ergodicity). However, a quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system can be scarred: the probability density of the eigenstate is enhanced in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit, above the classical, statistically expected density along the orbit (scars). In particular, scars are both a striking visual example of classical-quantum correspondence away from the usual classical limit, and a useful example of a quantum suppression of chaos. For example, this is evident in the perturbation-induced quantum scarring: More specifically, in quantum dots perturbed by local potential bumps (impurities), some of the eigenstates are strongly scarred along periodic orbits of unperturbed classical counterpart.

Further studies concern the parametric (formula_43) dependence of the Hamiltonian, as reflected in e.g. the statistics of avoided crossings, and the associated mixing as reflected in the (parametric) local density of states (LDOS). There is vast literature on wavepacket dynamics, including the study of fluctuations, recurrences, quantum irreversibility issues etc. Special place is reserved to the study of the dynamics of quantized maps: the standard map and the kicked rotator are considered to be prototype problems.

Works are also focused in the study of driven chaotic systems, where the Hamiltonian formula_44 is time dependent, in particular in the adiabatic and in the linear response regimes. There is also significant effort focused on formulating ideas of quantum chaos for strongly-interacting &quot;many-body&quot; quantum systems far from semi-classical regimes as well as a large effort in quantum chaotic scattering.

== Berry–Tabor conjecture ==
In 1977, Berry and Tabor made a still open &quot;generic&quot; mathematical conjecture which, stated roughly, is: In the &quot;generic&quot; case for the quantum dynamics of a geodesic flow on a compact Riemann surface, the quantum energy eigenvalues behave like a sequence of independent random variables provided that the underlying classical dynamics is completely integrable.

<doc id="313780" wikidata="Q3018199" url="?curid=313780" title="David Kaye (voice actor)">
<text>David Kaye is a Canadian voice actor. He is best known for animation roles such as Megatron in five of the &quot;Transformers&quot; series (&quot;Beast Wars&quot;, &quot;Beast Machines&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;), Optimus Prime in &quot;&quot;, Professor X in &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot;, Cronus in &quot;Class of the Titans&quot;, Khyber in &quot;Ben 10: Omniverse&quot;, several characters in &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;, and Duckworth in the reboot of &quot;DuckTales&quot;. He is also known for anime roles including Sesshōmaru in &quot;Inuyasha&quot; and Treize Khushrenada in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, and video game roles such as Clank in the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; series and Nathan Hale in the &quot;Resistance&quot; series. He is also the announcer for &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; on HBO and voiced the Celestial Arishem in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Eternals.&quot; He did voice work for various other studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for many years while occasionally doing voice work in Los Angeles, California, US, before fully relocating there in 2007.

==Early life==
During the 1980s, Kaye moved to Vancouver to work in radio. He also did theatre, playing George in a production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and Elwood P. Dowd in a production of &quot;Harvey&quot;.

==Career==
Kaye&#x27;s voice acting career began in 1989 with General Hawk in the DiC animated series &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;. Working as an on-air talent for radio station CKLG (LG73), he quickly became less interested as both on-camera and voice roles started taking up more of his time. On-camera opportunities came in the form of guest roles on TV series and movies such as &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, and &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;. During this time, he was cast in several animation shows and video games, including a role as Megatron in &quot;Beast Wars&quot;. This began a decades-long relationship with the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise. In 2007, Kaye become the first and (as of 2021) only actor in the franchise to play both Megatron and Optimus Prime in regular roles, voicing the latter for Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. He also lent his voice to the later series &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In anime, Kaye has been the voice behind Sesshomaru in the English dubbed &quot;InuYasha&quot; series, Treize Khushrenada in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, Recoome in &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; (1996–98) and as Soun Tendo in &quot;Ranma ½&quot;. His involvement in anime has led to several appearances at conventions. Kaye later moved to Los Angeles and has since worked on &quot;Ben 10: Omniverse&quot; as the villain Khyber, on &quot;Regular Show&quot; as Reginald, and on &quot;Xiaolin Chronicles&quot; as Clay Bailey, F-Bot, and Chase Young.

<text>The American woodcock (Scolopax minor), sometimes colloquially referred to as the timberdoodle, mudbat, bogsucker, night partridge, or Labrador twister is a small shorebird species found primarily in the eastern half of North America. Woodcocks spend most of their time on the ground in brushy, young-forest habitats, where the birds&#x27; brown, black, and gray plumage provides excellent camouflage.

The American woodcock is the only species of woodcock inhabiting North America. Although classified with the sandpipers and shorebirds in the family Scolopacidae, the American woodcock lives mainly in upland settings. Its many folk names include timberdoodle, bogsucker, night partridge, brush snipe, hokumpoke, and becasse.

The population of the American woodcock has fallen by an average of slightly more than 1% annually since the 1960s. Most authorities attribute this decline to a loss of habitat caused by forest maturation and urban development. Because of the male woodcock&#x27;s unique, beautiful courtship flights, the bird is welcomed as a harbinger of spring in northern areas. It is also a popular game bird, with about 540,000 killed annually by some 133,000 hunters in the United States.

In 2008, wildlife biologists and conservationists released an American woodcock conservation plan presenting figures for the acreage of early successional habitat that must be created and maintained in the United States and Canada to stabilize the woodcock population at current levels, and to return it to 1970s densities.

==Description==
The American woodcock has a plump body, short legs, a large, rounded head, and a long, straight prehensile bill. Adults are long and weigh . Females are considerably larger than males. The bill is long. Wingspans range from .

The plumage is a cryptic mix of different shades of browns, grays, and black. The chest and sides vary from yellowish-white to rich tans. The nape of the head is black, with three or four crossbars of deep buff or rufous. The feet and toes, which are small and weak, are brownish gray to reddish brown. Woodcocks have large eyes located high in their heads, and their visual field is probably the largest of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane and 180° in the vertical plane.

The woodcock uses its long, prehensile bill to probe in the soil for food, mainly invertebrates and especially earthworms. A unique bone-and-muscle arrangement lets the bird open and close the tip of its upper bill, or mandible, while it is sunk in the ground. Both the underside of the upper mandible and the long tongue are rough-surfaced for grasping slippery prey.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Scolopax&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is Latin for a snipe or woodcock. The type species is the Eurasian woodcock (&quot;Scolopax rusticola&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
Woodcocks inhabit forested and mixed forest-agricultural-urban areas east of the 98th meridian. Woodcocks have been sighted as far north as York Factory, Manitoba, and east to Labrador and Newfoundland. In winter, they migrate as far south as the Gulf Coast of the United States and Mexico.

The primary breeding range extends from Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick) west to southeastern Manitoba, and south to northern Virginia, western North Carolina, Kentucky, northern Tennessee, northern Illinois, Missouri, and eastern Kansas. A limited number breed as far south as Florida and Texas. The species may be expanding its distribution northward and westward.

After migrating south in autumn, most woodcocks spend the winter in the Gulf Coast and southeastern Atlantic Coast states. Some may remain as far north as southern Maryland, eastern Virginia, and southern New Jersey. The core of the wintering range centers on Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Based on the Christmas Bird Count results, winter concentrations are highest in the northern half of Alabama.

American woodcocks live in wet thickets, moist woods, and brushy swamps. Ideal habitats feature early successional habitat and abandoned farmland mixed with forest. In late summer, some woodcocks roost on the ground at night in large openings among sparse, patchy vegetation. 
*Courtship/breeding habitats include forest openings, roadsides, pastures, and old fields from which males call and launch courtship flights in springtime.
*Nesting habitats include thickets, shrubland, and young to middle-aged forest interspersed with openings.
*Feeding habitats have moist soil and feature densely growing young trees such as aspen (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.), birch (&quot;Betula&quot; spp.), and mixed hardwoods less than 20 years of age, and shrubs, particularly alder (&quot;Alnus&quot; spp.).
*Roosting habitats are semiopen sites with short, sparse plant cover, such as blueberry barrens, pastures, and recently heavily logged forest stands.

===Migration===
Woodcocks migrate at night. They fly at low altitudes, individually or in small, loose flocks. Flight speeds of migrating birds have been clocked at 16 to 28 mi/h (26 to 45 km/h). However, the slowest flight speed ever recorded for a bird, 5 mi/h (8 km/h), was recorded for this species. Woodcocks are thought to orient visually using major physiographic features such as coastlines and broad river valleys. Both the autumn and spring migrations are leisurely compared with the swift, direct migrations of many passerine birds.

In the north, woodcocks begin to shift southward before ice and snow seal off their ground-based food supply. Cold fronts may prompt heavy southerly flights in autumn. Most woodcocks start to migrate in October, with the major push from mid-October to early November. Most individuals arrive on the wintering range by mid-December. The birds head north again in February. Most have returned to the northern breeding range by mid-March to mid-April.

Migrating birds&#x27; arrival at and departure from the breeding range is highly irregular. In Ohio, for example, the earliest birds are seen in February, but the bulk of the population does not arrive until March and April. Birds start to leave for winter by September, but some remain until mid-November.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
Woodcocks eat mainly invertebrates, particularly earthworms (Oligochaeta). They do most of their feeding in places where the soil is moist. They forage by probing in soft soil in thickets, where they usually remain well-hidden. Other items in their diet include insect larvae, snails, centipedes, millipedes, spiders, snipe flies, beetles, and ants. A small amount of plant food is eaten, mainly seeds. Woodcocks are crepuscular, being most active at dawn and dusk.

===Breeding===
In spring, males occupy individual singing grounds, openings near brushy cover from which they call and perform display flights at dawn and dusk, and if the light levels are high enough, on moonlit nights. The male&#x27;s ground call is a short, buzzy &quot;peent&quot;. After sounding a series of ground calls, the male takes off and flies from into the air. He descends, zigzagging and banking while singing a liquid, chirping song. This high spiralling flight produces a melodious twittering sound as air rushes through the male&#x27;s outer primary wing feathers.

Males may continue with their courtship flights for as many as four months running, sometimes continuing even after females have already hatched their broods and left the nest. Females, known as hens, are attracted to the males&#x27; displays. A hen will fly in and land on the ground near a singing male. The male courts the female by walking stiff-legged and with his wings stretched vertically, and by bobbing and bowing. A male may mate with several females. The male woodcock plays no role in selecting a nest site, incubating eggs, or rearing young. In the primary northern breeding range, the woodcock may be the earliest ground-nesting species to breed.
The hen makes a shallow, rudimentary nest on the ground in the leaf and twig litter, in brushy or young-forest cover usually within of a singing ground. Most hens lay four eggs, sometimes one to three. Incubation takes 20 to 22 days. The down-covered young are precocial and leave the nest within a few hours of hatching. The female broods her young and feeds them. When threatened, the fledglings usually take cover and remain motionless, attempting to escape detection by relying on their cryptic coloration. Some observers suggest that frightened young may cling to the body of their mother, that will then take wing and carry the young to safety. Woodcock fledglings begin probing for worms on their own a few days after hatching. They develop quickly and can make short flights after two weeks, can fly fairly well at three weeks, and are independent after about five weeks.

The maximum lifespan of adult American woodcock in the wild is 8 years.

===Rocking behavior===

American woodcocks occasionally perform a rocking behavior where they will walk slowly while rhythmically rocking their bodies back and forth. This behavior occurs during foraging, leading ornithologists such as Arthur Cleveland Bent and B. H. Christy to theorize that this is a method of coaxing invertebrates such as earthworms closer to the surface. The foraging theory is the most common explanation of the behavior, and it is often cited in field guides. This theory is complicated by observations of rocking while slowly walking across ground that cannot be foraged, such as hard roads or deep snow. 

An alternative theory for the rocking behavior has been proposed by some biologists, such as Bernd Heinrich. It is thought that this behavior is a display to indicate to potential predators that the bird is aware of them. Heinrich notes that some field observations have shown that woodcocks will occasionally flash their tail feathers while rocking, drawing attention to themselves. This theory is supported by research done by John Alcock who believes this is a type of aposematism.

==Population status==
How many woodcock were present in eastern North America before European settlement is unknown. Colonial agriculture, with its patchwork of family farms and open-range livestock grazing, probably supported healthy woodcock populations.

The woodcock population remained high during the early and mid-20th century, after many family farms were abandoned as people moved to urban areas, and crop fields and pastures grew up in brush. In recent decades, those formerly brushy acres have become middle-aged and older forest, where woodcock rarely venture, or they have been covered with buildings and other human developments. Because its population has been declining, the American woodcock is considered a &quot;species of greatest conservation need&quot; in many states, triggering research and habitat-creation efforts in an attempt to boost woodcock populations.

Population trends have been measured through springtime breeding bird surveys, and in the northern breeding range, springtime singing-ground surveys. Data suggest that the woodcock population has fallen rangewide by an average of 1.1% yearly over the last four decades.

==Conservation==
The American woodcock is not considered globally threatened by the IUCN. It is more tolerant of deforestation than other woodcocks and snipes; as long as some sheltered woodland remains for breeding, it can thrive even in regions that are mainly used for agriculture. The estimated population is 5 million, so it is the most common sandpiper in North America.

The American Woodcock Conservation Plan presents regional action plans linked to bird conservation regions, fundamental biological units recognized by the U.S. North American Bird Conservation Initiative. The Wildlife Management Institute oversees regional habitat initiatives intended to boost the American woodcock&#x27;s population by protecting, renewing, and creating habitat throughout the species&#x27; range.

Creating young-forest habitat for American woodcocks helps more than 50 other species of wildlife that need early successional habitat during part or all of their lifecycles. These include relatively common animals such as white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, moose, bobcat, wild turkey, and ruffed grouse, and animals whose populations have also declined in recent decades, such as the golden-winged warbler, whip-poor-will, willow flycatcher, indigo bunting, and New England cottontail.

Leslie Glasgow, the assistant secretary of the Interior for Fish, Wildlife, Parks, and Marine Resources from 1969 to 1970, wrote a dissertation through Texas A&amp;M University on the woodcock, with research based on his observations through the Louisiana State University (LSU) Agricultural Experiment Station. He was an LSU professor from 1948 to 1980 and an authority on wildlife in the wetlands.

<text>Cape Hatteras is a cape located at a pronounced bend in Hatteras Island, one of the barrier islands of North Carolina.

As a temperate barrier island, the landscape has been shaped by wind, waves, and storms. There are long stretches of beach, sand dunes, marshes, and maritime forests in the area. A large area of the Outer Banks is part of a National Park, called the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. It is also the nearest landmass on the North American mainland to Bermuda, which is about to the east-southeast.

The treacherous waters off the coast of the Outer Banks are known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Over 600 ships wrecked here as victims of shallow shoals, storms, and war. Diamond Shoals, a bank of shifting sand ridges hidden beneath the turbulent sea off Cape Hatteras, has never promised safe passage for ships. In the past 400 years, the graveyard has claimed many lives, but island villagers saved many. As early as the 1870s, villagers served in the United States Life-Saving Service. Others staffed lighthouses built to guide mariners. Few ships wreck today, but storms still uncover the ruins of the old wrecks that lie along the beaches of the Outer Banks.

Cape Hatteras National Seashore protects parts of three barrier islands: Bodie Island, Hatteras Island, and Ocracoke Island. Beach and sound access ramps, campgrounds, nature trails, and lighthouses can be found and explored on all three islands.

The community of Buxton lies on the inland side of the Cape itself, at the widest part of Hatteras Island. It is the largest community on the island, and is home to the governmental offices and schools for the island.

==Geography==
Cape Hatteras lies in the chain of long, thin barrier islands of the Outer Banks, which arch out into the Atlantic Ocean away from the U.S. mainland, then back toward the mainland, creating lagoons and estuaries sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean. It is the site where the two great basins of the East Coast meet. The cape&#x27;s shoals are collectively known as Diamond Shoals.

===Climate===

Cape Hatteras has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), with long, hot summers, and short, mild winters. Most of the area falls into USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 9. Cape Hatteras is surrounded by water, with Pamlico Sound to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The proximity to water moderates conditions throughout the year, producing cooler summers and warmer winters than inland areas of North Carolina. The cape is the northern limit of tropical fauna.

For all narrative below, consult the climate table, showing climate data for the 1991–2020 period. During the summer, average daily highs are in the range, and occasional intense (but usually brief) thundershowers occur. As a result of its proximity to water, temperatures above are rare, with an average of only 2.3 days annually above ; one or two years out of each decade will not see any 90 °F readings. The coolest month, January, has a daily high of , with lows normally well above freezing at . The average window for freezing temperatures is from December 15 to March 6 (allowing a growing season of 283 days), between which there is an average of 16 nights with lows at or below the freezing mark. Extremes in temperature range from on January 21, 1985 up to on June 27, 1952.
Snowfall is observed only occasionally, and usually very light, with a median amount of 0. Precipitation, mostly in the form of rain, is over per year, making Cape Hatteras the wettest coastal location in North Carolina. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. However, April represents a slightly drier month than all others, while August to October are the wettest months. On average, September is the wettest month, owing to lingering summer thunderstorms and maximum frequency of tropical weather systems (hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions) that affect the area with often-heavy to torrential rains, mostly from August to early October.

Due to its exposed position, Cape Hatteras is virtually the highest-risk area for hurricanes and tropical storms along the entire U.S. eastern seaboard. Cape Hatteras can experience significant wind and/or water damage from tropical systems moving (usually northward or northeastward) near or over North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks, while other areas (i.e. Wilmington, NC or Myrtle Beach and Charleston, SC to the south and Norfolk, VA and Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore to the north) experience much less, minimal or no damage. The Cape Hatteras area is infamous for being frequently struck by hurricanes that move up the East Coast of the United States. The strike of Hurricane Isabel in 2003 was particularly devastating for the area. Isabel devastated the entire Outer Banks and also split Hatteras Island between the two small towns of Frisco and Hatteras. NC 12, which provides a direct route from Nags Head to Hatteras Island, was washed out when the hurricane created a new inlet. Students had to use a ferry to get to school. The inlet was filled in with sand by the Army Corps of Engineers, in a process which took nearly two months to complete. The road, electrical and water lines were quickly rebuilt when the inlet was filled. On September 6, 2019, Hurricane Dorian made landfall at Cape Hatteras.

==History==

The name Hatteras is the sixth oldest surviving English place-name in the U.S. An inlet north of the cape was named &quot;Hatrask&quot; in 1585 by Sir Richard Grenville, the admiral leading the Roanoke Colony expedition sent by Sir Walter Raleigh. It was later applied to the island and cape as well, and modified to &quot;Hatteras&quot;. Hatteras is the name of the Hatteras Indians.

Because mariners use ocean currents to speed their journey, many ships venture close to Cape Hatteras when traveling along the eastern seaboard, risking the perils of sailing close to the shoals amid turbulent water and the frequent storms occurring in the area. So many ships have been lost off Cape Hatteras that the area is known as the &quot;Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot;. Cape Hatteras is also well known for surfing.

The first lighthouse at the cape was built in 1803; it was replaced by the current Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in 1870, which at from the ground to the tip of its lightning rod is the tallest lighthouse in the United States and one of the tallest brick lighthouses in the world. In 1999, as the receding shoreline had come dangerously close to Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, the 4830-ton lighthouse was lifted and moved inland a distance of . Its distance from the seashore is now , about the same as when it was originally built.

The E.M. Clark (shipwreck and remains), Empire Gem (shipwreck and remains), and USS Monitor are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1956 the Naval Facility Cape Hatteras, adjacent to the lighthouse, became the eighth of nine shore terminals of the Atlantic Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) operational for over twenty-six years. The antisubmarine ocean surveillance purpose was classified and covered under &quot;oceanographic research&quot; until well after its decommissioning in June 1982. By 1963 there were 122 Navy personnel and 180 dependents resident at the facility.

==Awards and recognition==
Cape Hatteras has received the following awards:

* Top 10 U.S. Beaches, Travel Channel
* Top 10 U.S. Beaches for 2016, CNN
* America&#x27;s Top 10 Beaches of 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot;

==Education==
Residents are zoned to Dare County Schools. Zoned schools are Cape Hatteras Elementary School and Cape Hatteras Secondary School.

<doc id="313793" wikidata="Q11105360" url="?curid=313793" title="Medium of exchange">
<text>In economics, a medium of exchange is any item that is widely acceptable in exchange for goods and services. In modern economies, the most commonly used medium of exchange is currency. Most forms of money are categorised as mediums of exchange, including commodity money, representative money, cryptocurrency, and most commonly fiat money. Representative and fiat money most widely exist in digital form as well as physical tokens, for example coins and notes.

The origin of &quot;mediums of exchange&quot; in human societies is assumed by economists, such as William Stanley Jevons, to have arisen in antiquity as awareness grew of the limitations of barter. The form of the &quot;medium of exchange&quot; follows that of a token, which has been further refined as money. A &quot;medium of exchange&quot; is considered one of the functions of money. The exchange acts as an intermediary instrument as the use can be to acquire any good or service and avoids the limitations of barter; where what one wants has to be matched with what the other has to offer. However, there is little evidence of a pre-monetary society in which barter is the primary mode of exchange;
instead, such societies operated largely along the principles of gift economy and debt.

==Theories on the origin of money==
===Credit as the origin of money===
===Barter as the origin of money===

In a barter transaction, one valuable good is exchanged for another of approximately equivalent value. William Stanley Jevons described how a widely accepted medium allows each barter exchange to be split into three difficulties of barter. A medium of exchange is deemed to eliminate the need for a coincidence of wants.

====Want of coincidence====
A barter exchange requires each party to a transaction to have something the other desires. A medium of exchange removes that requirement, allowing an individual to sell and buy from various parties via an intermediary instrument.

====Want of a measure of value====
A barter market theoretically requires a value being known of every commodity, which is both impractical to arrange and impractical to maintain. If all exchanges go &#x27;through&#x27; an intermediate medium, such as money, then goods can be priced in terms of that one medium. The medium of exchange allows the relative values of items in the marketplace to be set and adjusted with ease. This is a dimension of the modern fiat money system referred to as a &quot;unit of account.&quot;

====Want of means of subdivision====
A barter transaction requires that both objects being bartered be of equivalent value. A medium of exchange is able to be subdivided into small enough units to approximate the value of any good or service.

====Transactions over time====
A barter transaction typically happens on the spot or over a short period of time. Money, on the other hand, also functions as a store of value, until what is wanted becomes available.

== Mutual impedance with store-of-value function ==
An ideal medium of exchange is spread throughout the marketplace to allow individuals with exchange potential to buy and sell. When money serves the function of a store of value, as fiat money does, there are conflicting drivers of monetary policy. This is because a store of value can become more valuable if it is scarce in the marketplace. When the medium of exchange is scarce, traders will pay to rent it (interest), which acts as an impedance to trade. In stable or deflationary environments, interest is a net transfer of wealth from debtor to creditor with the opposite transfer under inflationary environments.

== Medium of exchange and measure of value ==
Fiat currencies function as money with &quot;no intrinsic value&quot; but rather exchange values which facilitate a measurable value of exchange. The market measures or sets the real value of various goods and services using the medium of exchange as a unit of measure i.e., standard or the yard stick of measurement of wealth. There is no other alternative to the mechanism used by the market to set, determine, or measure the value of various goods and services. Determination of price is an essential condition for justice in exchange, efficient allocation of resources, economic growth, welfare and justice. 
The most important and essential function of a medium of exchange is to be widely acceptable and have relatively stable purchasing power (real value). The following characteristics are essential:

# Value common assets
# Common and accessible
# Constant utility
#Low cost of preservation
#Transportability
#Divisibility
#High market value in relation to volume and weight
#Recognisability
#Resistance to counterfeiting

To serve as a measure of value, a medium of exchange requires constant inherent value of its own or must be firmly linked to a definite basket of goods and services. Furthermore, constant intrinsic value and stable purchasing power are needed. Gold was long popular as a medium of exchange &quot;and&quot; store of value because it was inert, meaning it was convenient to move due to even small amounts of gold having a considerable and constant value.

Some critics of the prevailing system of fiat money argue that fiat money is the root cause of the continuum of economic crises, since it leads to the dominance of fraud, corruption, and manipulation, precisely as it does not satisfy the criteria for a medium of exchange cited above. Specifically, prevailing fiat money is free-floating, and depending upon its supply market finds or sets a value to it that continues to change as the supply of money shifts with respect to the economy&#x27;s demand. Increasing free-floating money supply with respect to needs of the economy reduces the quantity of the basket of the goods and services. It is not a unit or standard measure of wealth and so the manipulation impedes the market mechanism by setting or determining just prices. This leads to a situation where no value-related economic data is just or reliable. On the other hand, Chartalists claim that the ability to manipulate the value of fiat money is an advantage, in that fiscal stimulus is more easily available in times of economic crisis.

Because fiat money has &quot;no intrinsic value,&quot; when two parties use the same fiat money then the person purchasing the product or service can focus on the time price and ignore the monetary price. For example, if a person makes $5.00 an hour and wants to buy a product that costs $20.00 then the time price will be 4 hours and the actual price in fiat money need not be the focus.

== Requisites needed ==
Although the unit of account must be in some way related to the medium of exchange in use, e.g. ensuring coinage is in denominations of that unit, making accounting simpler to perform, it is more often the case that media of exchange have no natural relationship to that unit, and must be &#x27;minted&#x27; as having that value. Further, there may be variances in quality of the underlying good which may not have fully agreed perceived value grading. The difference between the two functions becomes obvious when one considers the fact that coins were very often &#x27;shaved.&#x27; Precious metal was removed from them, leaving them still useful as an identifiable coin in the marketplace, for a certain number of units in trade, but which no longer had the quantity of metal supplied by the coin&#x27;s minter. It was observed as early as Oresme, Copernicus and then in 1558 by Sir Thomas Gresham, that &quot;bad&quot; money drives out &quot;good&quot; in any marketplace; (Gresham&#x27;s law states &quot;Where legal tender laws exist, bad money drives out good money&quot;). A more precise definition follows that: &quot;A currency that is artificially overvalued by law will drive out of circulation a currency that is artificially undervalued by that law.&quot; Gresham&#x27;s law is a specific application of the general law of price controls. A common explanation is that people will always keep the less adultered, less clipped, less filed, less trimmed coin, and offer the other in the marketplace for the full units for which it is marked. It is inevitably the bad coins proffered, good ones retained.

Banks as financial intermediaries between ultimate savers and borrowers, and their ability to generate a medium of exchange marked higher than a fiat currency&#x27;s store of value, is the basis of banking. Central banking is based on the principle that no medium requires more than the guarantee of the state that it can be redeemed for payment of debt as &quot;legal tender&quot; – so all money equally backed by the state is considered good money, within that state. So long as that state produces anything of value to others, the medium of exchange has some value, and the currency may also be useful as a standard of deferred payment among others.

Of all functions of money, the medium of exchange function has historically been the most problematic due to counterfeiting, the systematic and deliberate creation of bad money with no authorization to do so, leading to the driving out of the good money entirely.

Other functions rely not on recognition of some token or weight of metal in a marketplace, where time to detect any counterfeit is limited and benefits for successful passing-off are high, but on more stable long term social contracts: one cannot easily force a whole society to accept a different standard of deferred payment, require even small groups of people to uphold a floor price for a store of value, still less to re-price everything and rewrite all accounts to a unit of account (the most stable function). Thus it tends to be the medium of exchange function that constrains what can be used as a form of financial capital.

It was once common in the United States to widely accept a check () as a medium of exchange, several parties endorsing it perhaps multiple times before it would eventually be deposited for its value in units of account, and thus redeemed. This practice became less common as it was exploited by forgers and led to a domino effect of bounced checks – a forerunner of the kind of fragility that electronic systems would eventually bring.

In the age of electronic money it was, and remains, common to use very long strings of difficult-to-reproduce numbers, generated by encryption methods, to authenticate transactions and commitments as having come from trusted parties. Thus the medium of exchange function has become wholly a part of the marketplace and its signals, and is utterly integrated with the unit of account function, so that, given the integrity of the public key system on which these are based, they become to that degree inseparable. This has clear advantages – counterfeiting is difficult or impossible unless the whole system is compromised, say by a new factoring algorithm. But at that point, the entire system is broken and the whole infrastructure is obsolete – new keys must be re-generated and the new system will also depend on some assumptions about difficulty of factoring.

Due to this inherent fragility, which is even more profound with electronic voting, some economists argue that units of account should not ever be abstracted or confused with the nominal units or tokens used in exchange. A medium is simply a medium, and should not be confused for the message.

<doc id="313798" wikidata="Q1948456" url="?curid=313798" title="Smith–Morra Gambit">
<text>In chess, the Smith–Morra Gambit (or simply Morra Gambit) is an opening gambit against the Sicilian Defence distinguished by the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

White sacrifices a pawn to quickly and create attacking chances. In exchange for the gambit pawn, White has a piece developed after 4.Nxc3 and a pawn in the , while Black has an extra pawn and a central pawn majority. The plan for White is straightforward and consists of placing his bishop on c4 to attack the f7-square, and controlling both the c- and d- with rooks, taking advantage of rapid development, open lines, and Black&#x27;s difficulty in finding a good square for the queen.

The Smith–Morra is popular at the club level and played occasionally by masters.
==History==
The Smith–Morra is named after (1900–1969) from France, and Ken Smith (1930–1999) of the Dallas Chess Club. In Europe the name &quot;Morra Gambit&quot; is preferred; other names for it, including &quot;Tartakower Gambit&quot; and &quot;Matulovic Gambit&quot;, have disappeared.

Around 1950, Morra published a booklet and several articles about the Smith–Morra. Smith wrote a total of nine books and forty-nine articles about the gambit. At the San Antonio 1972 chess tournament, Smith played it against Donald Byrne, Larry Evans, and Henrique Mecking, but lost all three games.

International Master Marc Esserman, author of the 2012 book &quot;Mayhem in the Morra!&quot;, is one of the leading advocates of the opening. In the Chessable Masters tournament in April 2023, Hikaru Nakamura played it in two rapid games against Fabiano Caruana, winning one and losing the other.

==Continuations overview==
Black has a wide choice of reasonable defences after 1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3. White sometimes plays 2.Nf3 and 3.c3, which depending on Black&#x27;s response may rule out certain lines. 3.Qxd4 Nc6 4.Qe3 is the Sicilian Center Game, similar to the Center Game, 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4 Nc6 4.Qe3.
==Themes for White==
In return for the sacrificed pawn, White acquires a number of benefits that can be used to create active plans:
* Active development and quick castling. White&#x27;s development scheme usually (but not always, as the Siberian trap demonstrates) consists of Nf3, Bc4, 0-0, Qe2, Rfd1, and Rac1 in some order.
** Additionally, the Bc1 will often develop to g5 when Black plays ...Nge7 to make it difficult for Black to continue developing without weakening the kingside slightly by ...h6 or ...f6.
* Prevention or delay of Black&#x27;s castling. This can open the door for powerful sacrificial ideas which, when correctly timed, can devastate the Black king:
** When Black&#x27;s king is uncastled, the sacrifice Nd5! is especially powerful with a Black pawn on e6, as the recapture ...exd5 would allow White to open the e-file for the White rook or queen. In two notable games, Esserman defeated GM Loek van Wely and GM Dommaraju Gukesh using this sacrifice.
** Another idea is Nxb5! with Black pawns on a6 and b5. Although not as common as Nd5!, it is possible in some lines like the Chicago Defence when Black is slow to castle. Occasionally, it is even possible when Black is castled if White&#x27;s tactics on the queenside justify it.
** The sacrifice Bxe6! is typical for Sicilian positions and can sometimes occur here as well.
* Pressure down the c- and d-files, usually achieved with rooks on c1 and d1.
* A long-lasting initiative that can be used to create a kingside attack.
To survive against a well-prepared White player, Black must first navigate the minefield of traps in the opening, then contend with White&#x27;s long-term pressure and initiative. If Black manages to do this while holding on to the extra pawn, he/she will have good chances to win the ensuing endgame. This is not easy, however, and many Sicilian players opt to decline the gambit altogether.

==Morra Gambit Accepted: 3...dxc3 ==

===4.Nxc3===
==== Scheveningen Formation ====

<doc id="313800" wikidata="Q320864" url="?curid=313800" title="Francis Atterbury">
<text>Francis Atterbury (6 March 1663 – 22 February 1732) was an English man of letters, politician and bishop. A High Church Tory and Jacobite, he gained patronage under Queen Anne, but was mistrusted by the Hanoverian Whig ministries, and banished for communicating with the Old Pretender in the Atterbury Plot. He was a noted wit and a gifted preacher.

==Early life==
He was born at Middleton, Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire, where his father was rector. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he became a tutor. In 1682, he published a translation of &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; into Latin verse with neither the style nor the versification typical of the Augustan age. In English composition he met greater success; in 1687 he published &quot;An Answer to some Considerations, the Spirit of Martin Luther and the Original of the Reformation&quot;, a reply to Obadiah Walker, who, when elected master of University College, Oxford, in 1676, had printed in a press set up by him there an attack on the Reformation written by Abraham Woodhead. Atterbury&#x27;s treatise, though highly praised by Bishop Gilbert Burnet, was more distinguished for the vigour of his rhetoric than the soundness of his arguments, and the Papists accused him of treason, and of having, by implication, called King James &quot;Judas&quot;.

==Clerical career==
After the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;, Atterbury readily swore fealty to the new government. He had taken holy orders in 1687, preached occasionally in London with an eloquence which raised his reputation, and was soon appointed one of the royal chaplains. He ordinarily lived at Oxford, where he was the chief adviser and assistant of Henry Aldrich, under whom Christ Church was a stronghold of Toryism. He inspired a pupil, Charles Boyle, in the &quot;Examination of Dr. Bentley&#x27;s Dissertations on the Epistles of Phalaris&quot;, an attack (1698) on the Whig scholar Richard Bentley, arising out of Bentley&#x27;s impugnment of the genuineness of the &quot;Epistles&quot; of Phalaris. He was figured by Swift in the &quot;Battle of the Books&quot; as the Apollo who directed the fight, and was, no doubt, largely the author of Boyle&#x27;s essay. Bentley spent two years in preparing his famous reply, which proved not only that the letters ascribed to Phalaris were spurious, but that all Atterbury&#x27;s wit and eloquence were a cloak for an audacious pretence at scholarship.

Atterbury was soon occupied in a dispute about matters still more important and exciting. High Church and Low Church divided the nation. The majority of the clergy were on the High Church side; the majority of King William&#x27;s bishops were inclined to latitudinarianism. In 1701 the Convocation, of which the lower house was overwhelmingly Tory, met after a gap of ten years. Atterbury threw himself with characteristic energy into the controversy, publishing a series of treatises. Many regarded him as the most intrepid champion that had ever defended the rights of the clergy against the oligarchy of Erastian prelates. In 1701 he became Archdeacon of Totnes and received a prebend in Exeter Cathedral. The lower house of Convocation voted him thanks for his services; the University of Oxford made him a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.); and in 1704, soon after the accession of Queen Anne, he was promoted to the Deanery of Carlisle Cathedral.

==Leadership of High Church Party==
In 1710, the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell produced a formidable explosion of High Church fanaticism. At such a moment Atterbury could not fail to be conspicuous. His inordinate zeal for the body to which he belonged and his rare talents for agitation and for controversy were again displayed. He took a chief part in framing that artful and eloquent speech which Sacheverell made at the bar of the House of Lords, and which presents a singular contrast to the absurd and scurrilous sermon which had very unwisely been honoured with impeachment. During the troubled and anxious months which followed the trial, Atterbury was among the most active of those pamphleteers who inflamed the nation against the Whig ministry and the Whig parliament. When the ministry changed and the parliament was dissolved, rewards were showered upon him. The lower house of Convocation elected him prolocutor, in which capacity he drew up, in 1711, the often-cited &quot;Representation of the State of Religion&quot;; and in August 1711, the queen, who had selected him as her chief adviser in ecclesiastical matters, appointed him Dean of Christ Church on the death of his old friend and patron Aldrich.

At Oxford he was as conspicuous a failure as he had been at Carlisle, and it was said by his enemies that he was made a bishop because he was so bad a dean. Under his administration, Christ Church was in confusion, scandalous altercations took place, and there was reason to fear that the great Tory college would be ruined by the tyranny of the great Tory doctor. In 1713 he was removed to the bishopric of Rochester, which was then always united with the deanery of Westminster. Still higher dignities seemed to be before him, for though there were many able men on the episcopal bench, there was none who equalled or approached him in parliamentary talents. Had his party continued in power it is not improbable that he would have been raised to the archbishopric of Canterbury. The more splendid his prospects the more reason he had to dread the accession of a family which was well known to be partial to the Whigs, and there is every reason to believe that he was one of those politicians who hoped that they might be able, during the life of Anne, to prepare matters in such a way that at her death there might be little difficulty in setting aside the Act of Settlement and placing James Francis Edward Stuart on the throne.

==Jacobitism==
Queen Anne&#x27;s sudden death confounded the projects of these conspirators, and, whatever Atterbury&#x27;s previous views may have been, he acquiesced in what he could not prevent, took the oaths to the House of Hanover, and did his best to ingratiate himself with the royal family. But his servility was requited with cold contempt; he became the most factious and pertinacious of all the opponents of the government. In the House of Lords his oratory, lucid, pointed, lively and set off with every grace of pronunciation and of gesture, aroused the attention and admiration even of a hostile majority. Some of the most remarkable protests which appear in the journals of the peers were drawn up by him; and, in some of the bitterest of those pamphlets which called on the English to stand up for their country against the aliens who had come from beyond the seas to allegedly oppress and plunder her, critics have detected his style. When the rebellion of 1715 broke out, he refused to sign the paper in which the bishops of the province of Canterbury declared their attachment to the Protestant accession, and in 1717, after having been long in indirect communication with the exiled family, he began to correspond directly with James Francis Edward Stuart.

Recent findings from the State Papers at Kew have established that Atterbury was the &#x27;Grand Prelate&#x27; of the Jacobite Order of Toboso in England. (The Order of Toboso was a Jacobite fraternity named in honour of Dulcinea del Toboso, the imaginary amour of Don Quixote. Both Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart were members).

==Arrest and imprisonment==
In 1721, on the discovery of the plot for the capture of the royal family and the proclamation of &quot;King James III&quot;, Atterbury was arrested with the other chief malcontents, and in 1722 committed to the Tower of London, where he remained in close confinement during some months. He had carried on his correspondence with the exiled family so cautiously that the circumstantial proofs of his guilt, though sufficient to produce entire moral conviction, were not sufficient to justify legal conviction. He could be reached only by a bill of pains and penalties. In 1723 such a bill passed the Commons depriving him of his spiritual dignities, banishing him for life, and forbidding any British subject to hold intercourse with him except by the royal permission. In the Lords the contest was sharp, but the bill finally passed by eighty-three votes to forty-three.

Atterbury took leave of those whom he loved with a dignity and tenderness worthy of a better man, to the last protesting his innocence with a singular disingenuousness. After a short stay at Brussels he went to Paris, and became the leading man among the Jacobite refugees there. He was invited to Rome by the Pretender, but Atterbury felt that a bishop of the Church of England would be out of place in Rome, and declined the invitation. During some months, however, he seemed to be high in the good graces of James. The correspondence between the master and the servant was constant. Atterbury&#x27;s merits were warmly acknowledged, his advice was respectfully received, and he was, as Bolingbroke had been before him, the prime minister of a king without a kingdom. He soon, however, perceived that his counsels were disregarded, if not distrusted. His proud spirit was deeply wounded. In 1728 he left Paris, occupied his residence at Montpellier, gave up politics, and devoted himself entirely to letters. In the sixth year of his exile he had so severe an illness that his daughter, Mrs Morice, herself very ill, determined to run all risks that she might see him once more. He met her at Toulouse, she received the last rites from him, and died that night.

==Later life and death==
Atterbury survived the shock of his daughter&#x27;s death, and returned to Paris and to the service of the Pretender. In the ninth year of his banishment he published a vindication of himself against John Oldmixon, who had accused him of having, in concert with other Christ Church men, garbled the new edition of Clarendon&#x27;s &quot;History of the Rebellion&quot;. He was not one of the editors of the &quot;History&quot;, and had never seen it until it was printed. Atterbury died, aged 68, on 22 February 1732.
His body was brought to England, and interred in Westminster Abbey. 
In his papers now kept at the Library of Westminster, he desired to be buried &quot;as far from kings and politicians as may be.&quot; Thus he is buried next to a 21st-century tourist information booth kiosk. The black slab is simple, indicating his name, birth and death dates; the inscription is now considerably worn.

Of his wife, Katherine Osborn, whom he married while at Oxford, little is known; but between him and his daughter there was affection. His fondness for John Milton was such as to many Tories seemed a crime; and he was the close friend of Joseph Addison. He lived on friendly terms with Jonathan Swift, John Arbuthnot and John Gay. With Matthew Prior he had a close intimacy. Alexander Pope found in Atterbury an admirer, adviser, and editor as requested.

<text>Simon Bolivar Buckner ( ; April 1, 1823 – January 8, 1914) was an American soldier, Confederate military officer, and politician. He fought in the United States Army in the Mexican–American War. He later fought in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. After the war, he served as the 30th governor of Kentucky.

After graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, Buckner became an instructor there. He took a hiatus from teaching to serve in the Mexican–American War, participating in many of its major battles. He resigned from the army in 1855 to manage his father-in-law&#x27;s real estate in Chicago, Illinois. He returned to his native state of Kentucky in 1857 and was appointed adjutant general by Governor Beriah Magoffin in 1861. In this position, he tried to enforce Kentucky&#x27;s neutrality policy in the early days of the Civil War. When the state&#x27;s neutrality was breached, Buckner accepted a commission in the Confederate Army after declining a similar commission to the Union Army. In 1862, he accepted Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s demand for an &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; at the Battle of Fort Donelson. He was the first Confederate general to surrender an army in the war. He spent five months as a prisoner of war. After his release, Buckner participated in Braxton Bragg&#x27;s failed invasion of Kentucky and near the end of the war became chief of staff to Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department.

In the years following the war, Buckner became active in politics. He was elected governor of Kentucky in 1887, in his second campaign for that office. His term was plagued by violent feuds in the eastern part of the state, including the Hatfield–McCoy feud and the Rowan County War. His administration was rocked by scandal when state treasurer James &quot;Honest Dick&quot; Tate absconded with $250,000 from the state&#x27;s treasury. As governor, Buckner became known for vetoing special interest legislation. In the 1888 legislative session alone, he issued more vetoes than the previous ten governors combined. In 1895, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. The following year, he joined the National Democratic Party, or &quot;Gold Democrats&quot;, who favored a gold standard policy over the Free Silver position of the mainline Democrats. He was the National Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for Vice President of the United States in the 1896 election, but polled just over one percent of the vote on a ticket with his running mate, ex-Union general John M. Palmer. He never again sought public office and died on January 8, 1914.

==Early life==
Simon B. Buckner (Sr.), was born at Glen Lily, his family&#x27;s estate near Munfordville, Kentucky. He was the third child and second son of Aylett Hartswell and Elizabeth Ann (Morehead) Buckner. Named after the &quot;Venezuelan soldier and statesman, Simón Bolívar who led the battles and independence from the Spanish Empire of Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Panama, then at the height of his power&quot;, Buckner did not begin school until age nine, when he enrolled at a private school in Munfordville. His closest friend in Munfordville was Thomas J. Wood, who would become a Union Army general opposing Buckner at the Battle of Perryville and the Battle of Chickamauga during the Civil War. Buckner&#x27;s father was an iron worker, but found that Hart County did not have sufficient timber to fire his iron furnace. Consequently, in 1838, he moved the family to southern Muhlenberg County where he organized an iron-making corporation. Buckner attended school in Greenville, and later at Christian County Seminary in Hopkinsville.

On July 1, 1840, Buckner enrolled at the United States Military Academy. In 1844, he graduated eleventh in his class of 25 and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Infantry Regiment. He was assigned to garrison duty at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on Lake Ontario until August 28, 1845, when he returned to the Academy to serve as an assistant professor of geography, history, and ethics.

==Service in the Mexican–American War==
In May 1846, Buckner resigned his teaching position to fight in the Mexican–American War, enlisting with the 6th U.S. Infantry Regiment. His early duties included recruiting soldiers and bringing them to the Texas border. In November 1846, he was ordered to join his company in the field; he met them en route between Monclova and Parras. The company joined John E. Wool at Saltillo. In January 1847, Buckner was ordered to Vera Cruz with William J. Worth&#x27;s division. While Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott besieged Vera Cruz, Buckner&#x27;s unit engaged a few thousand Mexican cavalry at a nearby town called Amazoque.

On August 8, 1847, Buckner was appointed quartermaster of the 6th Infantry. Shortly thereafter, he participated in battles at San Antonio and Churubusco, being slightly wounded in the latter battle. He was appointed a brevet first lieutenant for gallantry at Churubusco and Contreras, but declined the honor in part because reports of his participation at Contreras were in error—he had been fighting in San Antonio at the time. Later, he was offered and accepted the same rank solely based on his conduct at Churubusco.

Buckner was again cited for gallant conduct at the Battle of Molino del Rey, and was appointed a brevet captain. He participated in the Battle of Chapultepec, the Battle of Belen Gate, and the storming of Mexico City. At the conclusion of the war, American soldiers served as an army of occupation, which left them time for leisure activities. In April 1848 Buckner was a part of the successful expedition of Popocatépetl, a volcano southeast of Mexico City. Buckner was accorded the honor of lowering the American flag over Mexico City for the last time during the occupation. Buckner joined the Aztec Club, a military society of officers who served during the Mexican War, in 1891.

==Interbellum==
After the war, Buckner accepted an invitation to return to West Point to teach infantry tactics. Just over a year later, he resigned the post in protest over the academy&#x27;s compulsory chapel attendance policy. Following his resignation, he was assigned to a recruiting post at Fort Columbus.

Buckner married Mary Jane Kingsbury on May 2, 1850, at her aunt&#x27;s home in Old Lyme, Connecticut. Just before the conclusion of the ceremony, a fire broke out at a nearby home and Buckner and others rushed away to help extinguish the blaze, in the process saving an aged colored servant in the home. Shortly after their wedding, he was assigned to Fort Snelling and later to Fort Atkinson on the Arkansas River in present-day Kansas. On December 31, 1851, he was promoted to first lieutenant, and on November 3, 1852, he was elevated to captain of the commissary department of the 6th U.S. Infantry in New York City. Previously, he had attained only a brevet to these ranks. Buckner gained such a reputation for fair dealings with the Indians, that the Oglala Lakota tribe called him Young Chief, and their leader, Yellow Bear, refused to treat with anyone but Buckner.

Before leaving the Army, Buckner helped an old friend from West Point and the Mexican–American War, Captain Ulysses S. Grant, by covering his expenses at a New York hotel until money arrived from Ohio to pay for his passage home. On March 26, 1855, Buckner resigned from the Army to work with his father-in-law, who had extensive real estate holdings in Chicago, Illinois. When his father-in-law died in 1856, Buckner inherited his property and moved to Chicago to manage it.

Still interested in military affairs, Buckner joined the Illinois State Militia of Cook County as a major. On April 3, 1857, he was appointed adjutant general of Illinois by Governor William Henry Bissell. He resigned the post in October of the same year. Following the Mountain Meadows massacre, a regiment of Illinois volunteers organized for potential service in a campaign against the Mormons. Buckner was offered command of the unit and a promotion to the rank of colonel. He accepted the position, but predicted that the unit would not see action. His prediction proved correct, as negotiations between the federal government and Mormon leaders eased tensions between the two.

In late 1857, Buckner and his family returned to his native state and settled in Louisville. Buckner&#x27;s daughter, Lily, was born there on March 7, 1858. Later that year, a Louisville militia known as the Citizens&#x27; Guard was formed, and Buckner was made its captain. He served in this capacity until 1860, when the Guard was incorporated into the Kentucky State Guard&#x27;s Second Regiment. He was appointed inspector general of Kentucky in 1860.

==Civil War==
In 1861 Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin appointed Buckner adjutant general, promoted him to major general, and charged him with revising the state&#x27;s militia laws. The state was torn between Union and Confederacy, with the legislature supporting the former and the governor the latter. This led the state to declare itself officially neutral. Buckner assembled 61 companies to defend Kentucky&#x27;s neutrality.

The state board that controlled the militia considered it to be pro-secessionist and ordered it to store its arms. On July 20, 1861, Buckner resigned from the state militia, declaring that he could no longer perform his duties due to the board&#x27;s actions. That August he was twice offered a commission as a brigadier general in the Union Army—the first from general in chief Winfield Scott, and the second from Secretary of War Simon Cameron following the personal order of President Abraham Lincoln—but he declined. After Confederate Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk occupied Columbus, Kentucky, violating the state&#x27;s neutrality, Buckner accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on September 14, 1861, and was followed by many of the men he formerly commanded in the state militia. When his Confederate commission was approved, Union officials in Louisville indicted him for treason and seized his property. (Concerned that a similar action might be taken against his wife&#x27;s property in Chicago, he had previously deeded it to his brother-in-law.) He became a division commander in the Army of Central Kentucky under Brig. Gen. William J. Hardee and was stationed in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

===Fort Donelson===
After Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant captured Fort Henry on the Tennessee River in February 1862, he turned his sights on nearby Fort Donelson on the Cumberland. Western Theater commander Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston sent Buckner to be one of four brigadier generals defending the fort. In overall command was the influential politician and military novice John B. Floyd; Buckner&#x27;s peers were Gideon J. Pillow and Bushrod Johnson.

Buckner&#x27;s division defended the right flank of the Confederate line of entrenchments that surrounded the fort and the small town of Dover, Tennessee. On February 14, the Confederate generals decided they could not hold the fort and planned a breakout, hoping to join with Johnston&#x27;s army, now in Nashville. At dawn the following morning, Pillow launched a strong assault against the right flank of Grant&#x27;s army, pushing it back . Buckner, not confident of his army&#x27;s chances and not on good terms with Pillow, held back his supporting attack for over two hours, which gave Grant&#x27;s men time to bring up reinforcements and reform their line. Buckner&#x27;s delay did not prevent the Confederate attack from opening a corridor for an escape from the besieged fort. However, Floyd and Pillow combined to undo the day&#x27;s work by ordering the troops back to their trench positions.

Late that night the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and Pillow expressed satisfaction with the events of the day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant&#x27;s army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for treason if captured by the North, sought Buckner&#x27;s assurance that he would be given time to escape with some of his Virginia regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.

That morning, Buckner sent a messenger to the Union Army requesting an armistice and a meeting of commissioners to work out surrender terms. He may have been hoping Grant would offer generous terms, remembering the assistance he gave Grant when he was destitute, but Grant&#x27;s reply was curt. Sending his aide Colonel William Hillyer to deliver a dispatch in person, Grant&#x27;s reply included his famous quotation, &quot;No terms except unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works.&quot; To this, Buckner responded:

The asperity of these notes was only superficial; Buckner greeted his old friend warmly when Grant arrived to accept the surrender. They joked about their time in Mexico and the incompetence of General Pillow. Grant offered to loan Buckner money to see him through his impending imprisonment, but Buckner declined. As mentioned above, Buckner had paid for then-Captain Grant&#x27;s lodging in New York City after the Mexican War when Grant was destitute. As evidence of their mutual respect, Buckner later acted as a pall bearer and paid for Grant&#x27;s funeral in 1885, as well as provided Grant&#x27;s widow a financial monthly payment so she could live out her years. The surrender was a humiliation for Buckner personally, but also a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000 men and much equipment, as well as control of the Cumberland River, which led to the evacuation of Nashville.

===Invasion of Kentucky===
While Buckner was a Union prisoner of war at Fort Warren in Boston, Kentucky Senator Garrett Davis unsuccessfully sought to have him tried for treason. On August 15, 1862, after five months of writing poetry in solitary confinement, Buckner was exchanged for Union Brig. Gen. George A. McCall. The following day he was promoted to major general and ordered to Chattanooga, Tennessee, to join Gen. Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Mississippi.

Days after Buckner joined Bragg, both Bragg and Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith began an invasion of Kentucky. As Bragg pushed north, his first encounter was in Buckner&#x27;s home town of Munfordville. The small town was important for Union forces to hold if they wanted to maintain communication with Louisville while pressing southward to Bowling Green and Nashville. A small force under the command of Col. John T. Wilder guarded the town. Though vastly outnumbered, Wilder refused requests to surrender on September 12 and September 14. By September 17, however, Wilder recognized his difficult position and asked Bragg for proof of the superior numbers he claimed. In an unusual move, Wilder agreed to be blindfolded and brought to Buckner. When he arrived, he told Buckner that he (Wilder) was not a military man and had come to ask him what he should do. Flattered, Buckner showed Wilder the strength and position of the Confederate forces, which outnumbered Wilder&#x27;s men almost 5-to-1. Seeing the hopeless situation he was in, Wilder informed Buckner that he wanted to surrender. Any other course, he later explained, would be &quot;no less than willful murder&quot;.

Bragg&#x27;s men continued northward to Bardstown where they rested and sought supplies and recruits. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio, the main Union force in the state, was pressing toward Louisville. Bragg left his army and met Kirby Smith in Frankfort, where he was able to attend the inauguration of Confederate Governor Richard Hawes on October 4. Buckner, although protesting this distraction from the military mission, attended as well and gave stirring speeches to the local crowds about the Confederacy&#x27;s commitment to the state of Kentucky. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted by the sound of cannon fire from an approaching Union division and the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening was canceled.
Based on intelligence acquired by a spy in Buell&#x27;s army, Buckner advised Bragg that Buell was still ten miles from Louisville in the town of Mackville. He urged Bragg to engage Buell there before he reached Louisville, but Bragg declined. Buckner then asked Leonidas Polk to request that Bragg concentrate his forces and attack the Union army at Perryville, but again, Bragg refused. Finally, on October 8, 1862, Bragg&#x27;s army—not yet concentrated with Kirby Smith&#x27;s—engaged Maj. Gen. Alexander McCook&#x27;s corps of Buell&#x27;s army and began the Battle of Perryville. Buckner&#x27;s division fought under General Hardee during this battle, achieving a significant breakthrough in the Confederate center, and reports from Hardee, Polk, and Bragg all praised Buckner&#x27;s efforts. His gallantry was for naught, however, as Perryville ended in a tactical draw that was costly for both sides, causing Bragg to withdraw and abandon his invasion of Kentucky. Buckner joined many of his fellow generals in publicly denouncing Bragg&#x27;s performance during the campaign.

===Later Civil War service===
Following the Battle of Perryville, Buckner was reassigned to command the District of the Gulf, fortifying the defenses of Mobile, Alabama. He remained there until late April 1863, when he was ordered to take command of the Army of East Tennessee. He arrived in Knoxville on May 11, 1863, and assumed command the following day. Shortly thereafter, his department was converted into a district of the Department of Tennessee under Gen. Bragg and was designated the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee.

In late August, Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside approached Buckner&#x27;s position at Knoxville. Buckner called for reinforcements from Bragg at Chattanooga, but Bragg was being threatened by forces under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans and could not spare any of his men. Bragg ordered Buckner to fall back to the Hiwassee River. From there, Buckner&#x27;s unit traveled to Bragg&#x27;s supply base at Ringgold, Georgia, then on to Lafayette and Chickamauga. Bragg was also forced from Chattanooga and joined Buckner at Chickamauga. On September 19 and 20, the Confederate forces attacked and emerged victorious at the Battle of Chickamauga. Buckner&#x27;s Corps fought on the Confederate left both days, the second under the &quot;wing&quot; command of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, participating in the great breakthrough of the Union line.

After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland retreated to fortified Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, but refused to take any further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a tenuous supply line. Many of Bragg&#x27;s subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner was the author of the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President Jefferson Davis. Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.

Buckner was given a medical leave of absence following Chickamauga, returning to Virginia, where he engaged in routine work while recovering his strength. His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the Knoxville Campaign, while the remainder of Bragg&#x27;s army was defeated in the Chattanooga Campaign. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws after that subordinate of Longstreet&#x27;s was charged with poor performance at Knoxville. Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood&#x27;s division in February 1864, and on March 8, he was given command of the reestablished Department of East Tennessee. The department was a shell of its former self—less than one-third its original size, badly equipped, and in no position to mount an offensive. Buckner was virtually useless to the Confederacy here, and on April 28, he was ordered to join Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy.

Buckner had difficulty traveling to the West, and it was early summer before he arrived. He assumed command of the District of West Louisiana on August 4. Shortly after Buckner arrived at Smith&#x27;s headquarters in Shreveport, Louisiana, Smith began requesting a promotion for him. The promotion to lieutenant general came on September 20. Smith placed Buckner in charge of the critical but difficult task of selling the department&#x27;s cotton through enemy lines.

As news of Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender, on April 9, 1865, reached the department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves. On April 19, Smith consolidated the District of Arkansas with the District of West Louisiana; the combined district was put under Buckner&#x27;s command. On May 9, Smith made Buckner his chief of staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps that Smith and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though Smith did cross the Rio Grande, he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to New Orleans on May 26 and arranged terms of surrender. Smith had instead instructed Buckner to move all the troops to Houston, Texas.

At Fort Donelson, Tennessee, Buckner had become the first Confederate general of the war to surrender an army; at New Orleans, he became the last. The surrender became official when Smith endorsed it on June 2, (Only Brigadier General Stand Watie held out longer; he surrendered the last Confederate land forces on June 23, 1865).

Conditions set forth in Buckner&#x27;s surrender were the following:

# &quot;All acts of hostility on the part of both armies are to cease from this date.&quot;
# The officers and men are to be &quot;paroled until duly exchanged.&quot;
# All Confederate property was to be turned over to the Union.
# All officers and men could return home.
# &quot;The surrender of property will not include the side arms or private horses or baggage of officers&quot; and enlisted men.
# &quot;All &#x27;self-disposed persons&#x27; who return to &#x27;peaceful pursuits&#x27; are assured that may resume their usual avocations . . . &quot;.&quot;

==Postbellum life==
The terms of Buckner&#x27;s parole in Shreveport, Louisiana, on June 9, 1865, prevented his return to Kentucky for three years. He remained in New Orleans, worked on the staff of the &quot;Daily Crescent&quot; newspaper, engaged in a business venture, and served on the board of directors of a fire insurance company, of which he became president in 1867. His wife and daughter joined him in the winter months of 1866 and 1867, but he sent them back to Kentucky in the summers because of the frequent outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever.

Buckner returned to Kentucky when he was eligible in 1868 and became editor of the Louisville &quot;Courier&quot;. Like most former Confederate officers, he petitioned the United States Congress for the restoration of his civil rights as stipulated by the 14th Amendment. He recovered most of his property through lawsuits and regained much of his wealth through shrewd business deals.

On January 5, 1874, after five years of suffering with tuberculosis, Buckner&#x27;s wife died. Now a widower, Buckner continued to live in Louisville until 1877 when he and his daughter Lily returned to the family estate, Glen Lily, in Munfordville. His sister, a recent widow, also returned to the estate in 1877. For six years, these three inhabited and repaired the house and grounds which had been neglected during the war and its aftermath. On June 14, 1883, Lily Buckner married Morris B. Belknap of Louisville, and the couple made their residence in Louisville. On October 10 of the same year, Buckner&#x27;s sister died, and he was left alone.

On June 10, 1885, Buckner married Delia Claiborne of Richmond, Virginia. Buckner was 62; Claiborne was 28. Their son, Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., was born on July 18, 1886.

During Union General and President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s funeral, Buckner was one of the pallbearers. Which also included Union generals Sherman and Sheridan, Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston, Admiral David Dixon Porter, and Senator John A. Logan, the head of the GAR.

==Political career==
Buckner had a keen interest in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party&#x27;s nominee throughout the campaign.

In 1883, Buckner was a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Other prominent candidates included Congressman Thomas Laurens Jones, former congressman J. Proctor Knott, and Louisville mayor Charles Donald Jacob. Buckner consistently ran third in the first six ballots, but withdrew his name from consideration before the seventh ballot. The delegation from Owsley County switched their support to Knott, starting a wave of defections that resulted in Jones&#x27; withdrawal and Knott&#x27;s unanimous nomination. Knott went on to win the general election and appointed Buckner to the board of trustees for the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) in 1884. At that year&#x27;s state Democratic convention, he served on the committee on credentials.

===Governor of Kentucky===

Delegates to the 1887 state Democratic convention nominated Buckner unanimously for the office of governor. A week later, the Republicans chose William O. Bradley as their candidate. The Prohibition Party and the Union Labor Party also nominated candidates for governor. The official results of the election gave Buckner a plurality of 16,797 over Bradley.

Buckner proposed a number of progressive ideas, most of which were rejected by the legislature. Among his successful proposals were the creation of a state board of tax equalization, creation of a parole system for convicts, and codification of school laws. His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.

Much of Buckner&#x27;s time was spent trying to curb violence in the eastern part of the state. Shortly after his inauguration, the Rowan County War escalated to vigilantism, when residents of the county organized a posse and killed several of the leaders of the feud. Though this essentially ended the feud, the violence had been so bad that Buckner&#x27;s adjutant general recommended that the Kentucky General Assembly dissolve Rowan County, though this suggestion was not acted upon. In 1888, a posse from Kentucky entered West Virginia and killed a leader of the Hatfield clan in the Hatfield-McCoy feud. This caused a political conflict between Buckner and Governor Emanuel Willis Wilson of West Virginia, who complained that the raid was illegal. The matter was adjudicated in federal court, and Buckner was cleared of any connection to the raid. Later in Buckner&#x27;s term, feuds broke out in Harlan, Letcher, Perry, Knott, and Breathitt counties.

A major financial scandal erupted in 1888 when Buckner ordered a routine audit of the state&#x27;s finances which had been neglected for years. The audit showed that the state&#x27;s longtime treasurer, James &quot;Honest Dick&quot; Tate, had been mismanaging and embezzling the state&#x27;s money since 1872. Faced with the prospect that his malfeasance would be discovered, Tate absconded with nearly $250,000 of state funds. He was never found. The General Assembly immediately began impeachment hearings against Tate, convicted him &quot;in absentia&quot;, and removed him from office. State auditor Fayette Hewitt was censured for neglecting the duty of his office, but was not implicated in Tate&#x27;s theft or disappearance.

During the 1888 session, the General Assembly passed 1,571 bills, exceeding the total passed by any other session in the state&#x27;s history. Only about 150 of these bills were of a general nature; the rest were special interest bills passed for the private gain of legislators and those in their constituencies. Buckner vetoed 60 of these special interest bills, more than had been vetoed by the previous ten governors combined. Only one of these vetoes was overridden by the legislature. Ignoring Buckner&#x27;s clear intent to veto special interest bills, the 1890 legislature passed 300 more special interest bills than had its predecessor. Buckner vetoed 50 of these. His reputation for rejecting special interest bills led the Kelley Axe Factory, the largest axe factory in the country at the time, to present him with a ceremonial &quot;Veto Hatchet&quot;.

When a tax cut passed over Buckner&#x27;s veto in 1890 drained the state treasury, the governor loaned the state enough money to remain solvent until tax revenue came in. Later that year, he was chosen as a delegate to the state&#x27;s constitutional convention. In this capacity, he unsuccessfully sought to extend the governor&#x27;s appointment powers and levy taxes on churches, clubs, and schools that made a profit.

Buckner was a Compatriot of the Kentucky Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and was elected as a Vice President General in 1890.

===Later career===
After his term as governor, Buckner returned to Glen Lily. In 1895, he was one of four candidates nominated for a seat in the U.S. Senate — the others being the incumbent, J. C. S. Blackburn; outgoing governor John Y. Brown; and Representative James B. McCreary. The Democratic party split over the issue of bimetalism. Buckner advocated for a gold standard, but the majority of Kentuckians advocated &quot;Free Silver&quot;. Seeing that he would not be able to win the seat in light of this opposition, he withdrew from the race in July 1895. In spite of his withdrawal, he still received 9 of the 134 votes cast in the General Assembly.

At the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan for president and adopted a platform calling for the free coinage of silver. Gold standard Democrats opposed Bryan and the free silver platform. They formed a new party—the National Democratic Party, or Gold Democrats—which Buckner joined. At the new party&#x27;s state convention in Louisville, Buckner&#x27;s name was proposed as a candidate for vice president. He was given the nomination without opposition at the party&#x27;s national convention in Indianapolis. Former Union general John Palmer was chosen as the party&#x27;s nominee for president.

Palmer and Buckner both had developed reputations as independent executives while serving as governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. The ticket was endorsed by several major newspapers including the &quot;Chicago Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot;, &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, &quot;Richmond Times&quot;, and &quot;New Orleans Picayune&quot;. Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates&#x27; ages, Palmer being 79 and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote and might even throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over one percent of the vote in the election.
Following this defeat, Buckner retired to Glen Lily but remained active in politics. Though he always claimed membership in the Democratic party, he opposed the machine politics of William Goebel, his party&#x27;s gubernatorial nominee in 1899. In 1903, he supported his son-in-law, Morris Belknap, for governor against Goebel&#x27;s lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham. When the Democrats again nominated William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election, Buckner openly supported Bryan&#x27;s opponent, Republican William Howard Taft.

At 80 years of age, Buckner memorized five of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays because cataracts threatened to blind him, but an operation saved his sight. On a visit to the White House in 1904, Buckner asked President Theodore Roosevelt to appoint his only son as a cadet at West Point, and Roosevelt quickly agreed. His son Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. would later serve in the U.S. Army and be killed at the Battle of Okinawa, making him the highest-ranking American to have been killed by enemy fire during World War II.

Following the deaths of Stephen D. Lee and Alexander P. Stewart in 1908, Buckner became the last surviving Confederate soldier with the rank of lieutenant general. The following year, he visited his son, who was stationed in Texas, and toured old Mexican–American War battlefields where he had served. In 1912, his health began to fail. He died on January 8, 1914, after a week-long bout with uremic poisoning. He was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.

<text>Walter Horten (born 13 November 1913 in Bonn; died 9 December 1998 in Baden-Baden, Germany) and Reimar Horten (born 12 March 1915 in Bonn; died 14 March 1994 in Villa General Belgrano, Argentina), sometimes credited as the Horten Brothers, were German aircraft pilots. Walter was a fighter pilot on the Western Front, flying a Bf 109 for Jagdgeschwader 26 in the first six months of World War II; he eventually became the unit&#x27;s technical officer. Reimar was also trained as a Messerschmitt Bf 109 pilot; however, later in August 1940, he was transferred to the glider pilot school in Braunschweig. He earned his PhD in mathematics from the University of Göttingen, having resumed his studies in 1946 with help from Ludwig Prandtl. The Hortens designed the world&#x27;s first jet-powered flying wing, the Horten Ho 229.

==Biography==

===Early lives===
Between the World Wars, the Treaty of Versailles limited the construction of German military airplanes. In response, German military flying became semi-clandestine, taking the form of civil &quot;clubs&quot; where students trained on gliders under the supervision of ex-World War I veterans. As teenagers, the Horten brothers were involved in these flying clubs.

This back-to-the-basics education, and an admiration of German avant-aircraft designer Alexander Lippisch, led the Hortens away from the dominant design trends of the 1920s and 1930s, and toward experimenting with alternative airframes — building models and then filling their parents&#x27; house with full-sized wooden sailplanes. The first Horten glider flew in 1933, by which time both brothers were members of the Hitler Youth.
The Hortens&#x27; glider designs were extremely simple and aerodynamic, generally consisting of a huge, tailless albatross-wing with a tiny cocoon of a fuselage, in which the pilot lay prone. The great advantage of the Horten designs was the relatively low parasitic drag of their airframes.

===During World War II===
By 1939, with Adolf Hitler in power and the Treaty of Versailles no longer in effect, Walter and Reimar had entered the Luftwaffe as pilots. (A third brother, Wolfram, was killed flying a bomber over Dunkirk.) They were also called upon as design consultants, though Germany&#x27;s aeronautical community tended to regard the Hortens not as part of the cultural elite. However, both were members of the NSDAP.

Walter participated in the Battle of Britain, secretly flying as the wingman for Adolf Galland, and shot down seven British aircraft.

In 1937, the Hortens began using motorized airplanes, with the debut of the twin-engined pusher-prop airplane H.VII (an earlier glider had a mule engine). The Luftwaffe, however, did not actually use many of the Hortens&#x27; designs until 1942, but gave enthusiastic support to a twin-turbojet-powered fighter/bomber design, designated under Luftwaffe protocols as the Horten H.IX. For their completion of the three Ho 229 prototypes (V1, V2, V3), the Horten brothers were awarded 500,000 Reichsmark (approximately US$2–3 million in 2021 terms).

Securing the allocation of turbojets was difficult in wartime Germany, as other projects carried higher priority due to their rank in the overall war effort. 
Although the turbojet-equipped Ho 229 V2 nearly reached a then-astonishing in trials, the production of the third prototype &quot;V3&quot; was given over to the coachbuilder Gothaer Waggonfabrik, subsequently called Gotha Go 229. The Go 229 was captured by the U.S. Army at the end of World War 2, and the nearly complete &quot;V3&quot; third prototype aircraft was shipped to the US to be studied. It is presently stored at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

The Ho 229 had potential, but it was simply developed too late to see service. The Horten brothers also worked on the Horten H.XVIII, an intercontinental bomber that was part of the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; project, and a prototype for a smaller version was ordered for the 1000 x 1000 x 1000 contest, for a bomber capable of flying at with bombs with a range.

Among other advanced Horten designs of the 1940s was the supersonic delta-wing H.X, designed as a hybrid turbojet/rocket fighter with a top speed of Mach 1.4, but it was only tested in glider form as the Horten H.XIII.

===Post World War II===
As the war ended, Reimar Horten emigrated to Argentina after failed negotiations with the United Kingdom and China, where he continued designing and building gliders, including one experimental supersonic delta-wing aircraft and the four-engined flying wing FMA I.Ae 38 Naranjero, intended to carry oranges from producers to Buenos Aires. Walter remained in Germany after the war and became an officer in the post-war German Air Force. Reimar died on his ranch in Argentina in 1994, while Walter died in Germany in 1998.

In the late 1940s, the personnel of Project Sign, the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s flying saucer investigation, seriously considered the possibility that UFOs might have been secret aircraft manufactured by the U.S.S.R. based on the Hortens&#x27; designs.

<doc id="313811" wikidata="Q488341" url="?curid=313811" title="Western sandpiper">
<text>The western sandpiper (Calidris mauri) is a small shorebird. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;mauri&quot; commemorates Italian botanist Ernesto Mauri (1791–1836).

This is one of the most abundant shorebird species in North America, with a population in the millions.

==Description==
Adults have dark legs and a short, thin, dark bill, thinner at the tip. The body is brown on top and white underneath. They are reddish-brown on the crown. This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds, especially the semipalmated sandpiper. This is particularly the case in winter plumage, when both species are plain gray. The western sandpiper acquires winter plumage much earlier in the autumn than the semipalmated sandpiper.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.5–6.7 in (14–17 cm)
* Weight: 0.8–1.2 oz (22–35 g)
* Wingspan: 13.8–14.6 in (35–37 cm)

==Breeding==
Their breeding habitat is tundra in eastern Siberia and Alaska. They nest on the ground usually under some vegetation. The male makes several scrapes; the female selects one and lays four eggs. Both parents incubate and care for dependent young, who feed themselves. Sometimes the female deserts her mate and brood prior to offspring fledging.

==Migration==
They migrate to both coasts of North America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

==Diet==
These birds forage on mudflats during migration and the non-breeding season by probing or picking up food by sight. Foraging occurs on tundra and wet meadows during the breeding season. They had been thought to mainly eat insects, spiders, small crustaceans, mollusks, polychaete worms, and seeds, but are now known to heavily graze on biofilm from the surface of intertidal mudflats.

<text>John Oldmixon (1673 – 9 July 1742) was an English historian.

He was a son of John Oldmixon of Oldmixon, Weston-super-Mare in Somerset. He was brought up by the family of Admiral Robert Blake in Bridgwater and later became involved in trade through the port of Bristol.

His first writings were poetry and dramas, among them being &quot;Amores Britannici; Epistles Historical and Gallant&quot; (1703); and a tragedy, &quot;The Governor of Cyprus&quot;. His earliest historical work was &quot;The British Empire in America&quot; (1708), followed by &quot;The Secret History of Europe&quot; (1712-1715); &quot;Arcana Gallica, Or the Secret History of France for the Last Century&quot; (1714); and other smaller writings.

More important, although very biased, are Oldmixon&#x27;s works on English history. His &quot;Critical History of England&quot; (1724-1726) contains attacks on Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and a defence of Bishop Gilbert Burnet, and its publication led to a controversy between Dr Zachary Grey and the author, who replied to Grey in his &quot;Clarendon and Whitlock Compared&quot; (1727). On the same lines, he wrote his &quot;History of England During the Reigns of the Royal House of Stuart&quot; (1730). Herein, he charged Francis Atterbury and other editors with tampering with the text of the &quot;History&quot;. From his exile, Atterbury replied to this charge in a &quot;Vindication&quot;, and although Oldmixon continued the controversy it is practically certain that he was in the wrong.

He completed a continuous history of England by writing the &quot;History of England During the Reigns of William and Mary, Anne and George I&quot; (1735); and the &quot;History of England During the Reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth&quot; (1739). Among his other writings are, &quot;Memoirs of North Britain&quot; (1715), &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot; (1728) and &quot;Memoirs of the Press 1710-1740&quot; (1742), which was published only after his death. Oldmixon had much to do with editing two periodicals, &quot;The Muses Mercury&quot; and &quot;The Medley&quot;, and he often complained that his services were overlooked by the government.

<text>Obadiah Walker (161621 January 1699) was an English academic and Master of University College, Oxford, from 1676 to 1688.

==Life==
Walker was born at Darfield, Yorkshire, and was educated at University College, Oxford, becoming a fellow and tutor of this College and a prominent figure in University circles. In July 1648, an act of parliament deprived him of his academic appointments, and he passed some years in teaching, studying and travelling. He returned to Oxford at the Restoration of 1660, and a few years began later to take a leading part in the work of University College. In June 1676, he became head or &quot;Master&quot; of the college, and in this capacity he collected money for some rebuilding, and arranged the publication by the college of a Latin edition of Sir John Spelman&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alfred the Great&quot;.

This was the time of Titus Oates and the &quot;Popish Plot&quot;, and some of Walker&#x27;s writings made him a suspect; however, no serious steps were taken against him, although Oxford booksellers were forbidden to sell his book, &quot;The benefits of our Saviour Jesus Christ to mankind&quot;. He remained a Protestant, in name at least, until the accession of James II. Soon after this event he became a Roman Catholic, opening a Catholic chapel at University College, and he advised the new king with regard to affairs in Oxford, being partly responsible for the tactless conduct of James in forcing a quarrel with the fellows of Magdalen College. Mass was said in his residence, and later a chapel was opened in the college for Catholic worship; he and others received a royal licence to absent themselves from the services of the Church of England, and he obtained another to supervise the printing of Roman Catholic books.

In spite of growing unpopularity, he remained loyal to James, and when the king fled from England, Walker left Oxford, doubtless intending to join his master abroad. But in December 1688, he was arrested at Sittingbourne and was imprisoned; then, having lost his mastership, he was charged at the bar of the House of Commons with changing his religion and with other offences. Early in 1690, he was released from his confinement, and spent his last years subsisting largely on the charity of his friend and former pupil at University College, Dr John Radcliffe. Radcliffe gave Walker an east window for his chapel at the College and also a pension.

Walker was responsible for the statue of King James II on the tower in the main quad at University College, one of only two in England. The other statue is located in Trafalgar Square, London.

He died in 1699 and is buried in Old St Pancras Churchyard, London.

==Works==
Walker&#x27;s principal writings are: 
&quot;Of education, especially of young gentlemen&quot; (Oxford, 1673, and six other editions)
&quot;Ars rationis ad mentem nominalium libri tres&quot; (Oxford, 1673)
&quot;Greek and Roman History illustrated by Coins and Medals&quot; (London, 1692).

<text>The haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) is a saltwater ray-finned fish from the family Gadidae, the true cods. It is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Melanogrammus&quot;. It is found in the North Atlantic Ocean and associated seas, where it is an important species for fisheries, especially in northern Europe, where it is marketed fresh, frozen and smoked; smoked varieties include the Finnan haddie and the Arbroath smokie. Other smoked versions include long boneless, the fileted side of larger haddock smoked in oak chips with the skin left on the fillet.

==Description==
The haddock has the elongated, tapering body shape typical of members of the cod family. It has a relatively small mouth which does not extend to below the eye; with the lower profile of the face being straight and the upper profile slightly rounded, this gives its snout a characteristic wedge-shaped profile. The upper jaw projects beyond the lower more so than in the Atlantic cod. There is a rather small barbel on the chin. There are three dorsal fins, the first being triangular in shape and these dorsal fins have 14 to 17 fin rays in the first, 20 to 24 in the second, and 19 to 22 in the third. There are also two anal fins and in these there are 21 to 25 fin rays in the first and 20 to 24 fin rays in the second. The anal and dorsal fins are all separated from each other. The pelvic fins are small with an elongated first fin ray.

The upper side of the haddock&#x27;s body varies in colour from dark grey brown to nearly black while the lower part of the body is dull silvery white. It has a distinctive black lateral line contrasting with the whitish background colour and which curves slightly over the pectoral fins. It also has a distinctive oval black blotch or ‘thumbprint’, sometimes called the &quot;Devil&#x27;s thumbprint&quot;, which sits between the lateral line and the pectoral fin, a feature which leads to the name of the genus &quot;Melanogrammus&quot; which derives from Greek &quot;melanos&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;gramma&quot; meaning letter or signal. The dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins are dark grey in colour while the anal fins are pale matching the colour of the silvery sides, with black speckles at their bases. The pelvic fins are white with a variable amount of black spots. Occasionally there are differently coloured variants recorded which may be barred, golden on the back or lack the dark shoulder blotch.

The longest haddock recorded was in length and weighed . However, haddock are rarely over in length and the vast majority of haddocks caught in the United Kingdom measure between . In eastern Canada waters, haddock range in size from in length and in weight.

==Distribution==
The haddock has populations on either side of the north Atlantic but it is more abundant in the eastern Atlantic than it is on the North American side. In the north-east Atlantic it occurs from the Bay of Biscay north to Spitzbergen; however, it is most abundant north of the English Channel. It also occurs around Novaya Zemlya and the Barents Sea in the Arctic. The largest stocks are in the North Sea, off the Faroe Islands, off Iceland and the coast of Norway but these are discrete populations with little interchange between them. Off North America, the haddock is found from western Greenland south to Cape Hatteras, but the main commercially fished stock occurs from Cape Cod and the Grand Banks.

==Habitat and biology==

The haddock is a demersal species which occurs at depths from , although it is most frequently recorded at . It is found over substrates made up of rock, sand, gravel or shells and it prefers temperatures of between . Off Iceland and in the Barents Sea, haddock undergo extensive migrations, but in the north western Atlantic its movements are more restricted, consisting of movements to and from their spawning areas. They reach sexual maturity at 4 years old in males and 5 years old in females, except for the population in the North Sea which matures at ages of 2 years in males and 3 years in females. The overall sex ratio is roughly 1:1, but in shallower areas, females predominate, while the males show a preference for waters further offshore.

The fecundity of the females varies with size: a fish of length bears 55,000 eggs while a fish at has 1,841,000 eggs. Spawning takes place from depths of around . In the northwestern Atlantic spawning lasts from January to July, although it does not occur simultaneously in all areas, and in the northeastern Atlantic the spawning season runs from February to June, peaking in March and April. The eggs are pelagic with a diameter of , and they take one to three weeks to hatch. Following metamorphosis, the past larval fish remain pelagic until they attain a length of around , when they settle to a demersal habit. Their growth rate shows considerable regional variation and fish at one year old can measure , at 2 years old , up to at 13 years old. Their lifespan is around 14 years. The most important spawning grounds are in the waters off the central coast of Norway, off the southwest of Iceland, and over the Georges Bank. The fish which spawn in inshore waters are normally smaller and younger fish than those which occur in offshore areas. The younger fish have a spawning season which is less than half of that of the larger and older stock offshore. Once hatched the larvae do not appear to travel far from their spawning grounds, however some larvae spawning off the west coast of Scotland are transported into the North Sea through the Fair Isle-Shetland Gap or to the northeast of Shetland.

In their larval stages, haddock mainly feed on the immature stages of copepods, ostracods and limacina with their diet changing as they grow, moving on to larger pelagic prey such as amphipods, euphausiids, eggs of invertebrates, zoea larvae of decapods and increasing numbers of copepods. Once they have reached the settled, demersal, post-larval stage, they gradually switch from pelagic to benthic prey. Adults primarily feed on benthic invertebrates such as sea urchins, brittlestars, bivalves and worms, however, they will feed opportunistically on smaller fish such as capelin, sandeels and &quot;Norway pout.&quot; Juvenile haddock are an important prey for larger demersal fish, including other gadoids, while seals prey on the larger fish.

The recorded growth rates of haddock underwent significant change over the 30 to 40 years up to 2011. Growth has been more rapid in recent years, with haddock attaining adult size much earlier than was noted 30–40 years ago. However, the degree to which these larger, younger fish contribute to reproductive success of the population is unknown. The growth rates of haddock, however, have slowed in recent years. There is some evidence which indicates that these slower growth rates may be the result of an exceptionally large year class in 2003. The haddock stock periodically has higher than normal productivity; for example in 1962 and 1967, and to a lesser extent, 1974 and 1999. These result in a more southerly distribution of the fish and have a strong effect on the biomass of the spawning stock, but because of high fishing mortality, these revivals do not have any lasting effect on the population. In general, there was above average recruitment from the 1960s up to the early 1980s, similar to recruitment for Atlantic cod and whiting, this has been called the &quot;gadoid outburst&quot;. There was strong recruitment in 1999 but since then, the recruitment rate has been very low.

==Parasites==
Cod and related species are plagued by parasites. For example, the cod worm, &quot;Lernaeocera branchialis&quot;, starts life as a copepod, a small, free-swimming crustacean larva. The first host used by cod worm is a flatfish or lumpsucker, which they capture with grasping hooks at the front of their bodies. They penetrate the lumpsucker with a thin which they use to suck its blood. The nourished cod worms then mate on the lumpsucker.

The female worm, with her now fertilized eggs, then finds a cod, or a cod-like fish such as a haddock or whiting. There, the worm clings to the gills while it metamorphoses into a plump, sinusoidal, wormlike body, with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear. The front part of the worm&#x27;s body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host&#x27;s heart. There, firmly rooted in the cod&#x27;s circulatory system, the front part of the parasite develops like the branches of a tree, reaching into the main artery. In this way, the worm extracts nutrients from the cod&#x27;s blood, remaining safely tucked beneath the cod&#x27;s gill cover until it releases a new generation of offspring into the water.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The haddock was first formally described as &quot;Gadus aeglefinus&quot; in 1758 by Carolus Linnaeus in the 10th edition of volume one of his &quot;Systema naturae&quot; with a type locality given as &quot;European seas&quot;. In 1862 Theodore Nicholas Gill created the genus &quot;Melanogrammus&quot; with &quot;M. aeglefinus&quot; as its only species. The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies the haddock within the subfamily Gadinae, the typical cods, of the family Gadidae, which is within the superfamily Gadoidea of the order Gadiformes.

The generic name &quot;Melanogrammus&quot; means &quot;black line&quot;, a reference to the black lateral line of this species. The specific name is a latinisation of the vernacular names &quot;egrefin&quot; and &quot;eglefin&quot;, used in France and England.

==Fisheries==

Haddock is fished year-round using gear such as Danish seine nets, trawlers, long lines and gill nets and is often caught in mixed species fishery with other groundfish species such as cod and whiting. The main fishing grounds in the eastern Atlantic are in the Barents Sea, around Iceland, around the Faeroe Islands, in the North Sea, Celtic Sea, and in the English Channel. Landings in the eastern Atlantic have fluctuated around 200–350 thousand tonnes in the period 1980–2017. During the 1980s, the largest portion of the catch was taken at Rockall but from about 2000, the majority of the catch is caught in the Barents Sea. All the stocks in eastern Atlantic are assessed by ICES, which publish a recommendations on an annual basis for Total Allowable Catch.

In the western Atlantic the eastern Georges Bank haddock stock is jointly assessed on an annual basis by Canada and the United States and the stock is collaboratively managed through the Canada–United States Transboundary Management Guidance Committee, which was established in 2000. The commercial catch of haddock in North America was approximately 40–60 thousand tonnes per year between 1920 and 1960. This declined sharply in the late 1960s to between 5 and 30 thousand tonnes per year. Despite a few good years post-1970, landings have not returned to historical levels.

Haddock currently resides on the Greenpeace seafood red list due to concerns regarding the impact of bottom trawls on the marine environment. In contrast, Monterey Bay Aquarium considers haddock a &quot;good alternative&quot;. Many haddock fisheries have been certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council. All seven stocks assessed in the eastern Atlantic are currently considered by ICES to be harvested sustainably. The haddock populations in the western Atlantic (offshore grounds of Georges Bank off New England and Nova Scotia) are also considered to be harvested sustainably.

==As food==
Haddock is very popular as a food fish. It is sold fresh or preserved by smoking, freezing, drying, or to a small extent canning. Haddock, along with Atlantic cod and plaice, is one of the most popular fish used in British fish and chips. When fresh, the flesh of haddock is clean and white and its cooking is often similar to that of cod. A fresh haddock fillet will be firm and translucent and hold together well but less fresh fillets will become nearly opaque. Young, fresh haddock and cod fillets are often sold as scrod in Boston, Massachusetts; this refers to the size of the fish which have a variety of sizes, i.e., scrod, markets, and cows. Haddock is the predominant fish of choice in Scotland in a fish supper. It is also the main ingredient of Norwegian fishballs (&quot;fiskeboller&quot;). Unlike cod, haddock is not an appropriate fish for salting and preservation is more commonly effected by drying and smoking.

The smoking of haddock was highly refined in Grimsby. Traditional Grimsby smoked fish (mainly haddock, but sometimes cod) is produced in the traditional smokehouses in Grimsby, which are mostly family-run businesses that have developed their skills over many generations. Grimsby fish market sources its haddock from the North East Atlantic, principally Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. These fishing grounds are sustainably managed and have not seen the large scale depreciation in fish stocks seen in EU waters.

One popular form of haddock is Finnan haddie which is named after the fishing village of Finnan or Findon in Scotland, where the fish was originally cold-smoked over smouldering peat. Finnan haddie is often poached in milk and served for breakfast.

The town of Arbroath on the east coast of Scotland produces the Arbroath smokie. This is a hot-smoked haddock which requires no further cooking before eating.

Smoked haddock is naturally an off-white colour and it is frequently dyed yellow, as are other smoked fish. Smoked haddock is the essential ingredient in the Anglo-Indian dish kedgeree, and also in the Scottish dish Cullen skink, a chowder-like soup.

<text>Thai Airways Company or Thai Airways (TAC; ) was the domestic flag carrier of Thailand. Its main base was the domestic terminal (Terminal 3) at Don Mueang International Airport (then known as &quot;Bangkok International Airport&quot;). Its head office was located in Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok. In 1988, Thai Airways merged to become Thai Airways International ().

==History==

Thai Airways traces its roots to the Siamese Airways Company Limited, the domestic flag carrier of Thailand formed on 1 March 1947 by a cabinet resolution. The fleet initially consisted of Douglas DC-3, Beechcraft C-45, L-5 Sentinel, Rearwin and Fairchild aircraft. The inaugural flight was Bangkok-Phitsanulok-Lampang-Chiang Mai and a Chiang Mai-Mae Sariang-Mae Hong Son service began two days later. The first international flight, a Bangkok-Songkhla-Penang service, took place in December 1947.

Siamese Airways merged with Pacific Overseas Airlines (Siam) Limited (POAS), to form Thai Airways Company Limited (TAC) ( (บดท)) - commonly Thai Airways, following a government resolution on 1 November 1951.

In 1960, Thai Airways established the international flag carrier, Thai Airways International Company Limited (THAI; ). The international carrier was a joint venture between Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) with the Scandinavian carrier initially providing a 30% share capital of two million baht.

Thai Airways acquired an Avro 748 turboprop in 1963, a Boeing 737-200 jet in 1977, a Short 330 in 1982, and Short 360 and Airbus A310-200 in 1985.

On 1 April 1988, Thai Airways Company Limited (TAC) merged with Thai Airways International to create the unitary national airline of the Kingdom of Thailand, under a cabinet resolution and direction of the Prime Minister, General Prem Tinsulanonda.

Thai Airways&#x27;s 11 aircraft, comprising three Boeing 737-200, four Short 330, two Short 360 and two Airbus A310-200, combined fleet with Thai Airways International, for a total of 41 aircraft. Airline codes changed to Thai Airways International&#x27;s airline codes at the end of 1988.

<doc id="313827" wikidata="Q869896" url="?curid=313827" title="Croix de Guerre">
<text>The  (, &quot;Cross of War&quot;) is a military decoration of France. It was first created in 1915 and consists of a square-cross medal on two crossed swords, hanging from a ribbon with various degree pins. The decoration was first awarded during World War I, again in World War II, and in other conflicts; the &quot;croix de guerre des théâtres d&#x27;opérations extérieures&quot; (&quot;cross of war for external theatres of operations&quot;) was established in 1921 for these. The was also commonly bestowed on foreign military forces allied to France.

The may be awarded either as an individual award or as a unit award to those soldiers who distinguish themselves by acts of heroism involving combat with the enemy. The medal is awarded to those who have been &quot;mentioned in dispatches&quot;, meaning a heroic deed or deeds were performed meriting a citation from an individual&#x27;s headquarters unit. The unit award of the with palm was issued to military units whose members performed heroic deeds in combat and were subsequently recognized by headquarters.

==Appearance==
The medal varies depending on which country is bestowing the award and for what conflict. Separate French medals exist for the First and Second World War.

For the unit decoration of the , a &quot;fourragère&quot; (which takes the form of a braided cord) is awarded; this is suspended from the shoulder of an individual&#x27;s uniform.

As the is issued as several medals, and as a unit decoration, situations typically arose where an individual was awarded the decoration several times, for different actions, and from different sources. Regulations also permitted the wearing of multiple , meaning that such medals were differentiated in service records by specifying &quot;French &quot;, &quot;French (WWI)&quot;, etc.

== French Croix de Guerre ==
There are three distinct medals in the French system of honours:
Furthermore, the French collaborationist government created two &quot;croix&quot; during World War II. These &quot;croix&quot; are now illegal under French law and wearing them is outlawed:

The &quot;Croix&quot; was created by a law of April 2, 1915, proposed by French deputy Émile Briant. The Croix reinstated and modified an older system of mentions in dispatches, which were only administrative honours with no medal accompanying them. The sculptor Paul-André Bartholomé created the medal, a bronze cross with swords, showing the effigy of the republic.

The French Croix represents a mention in dispatches awarded by a commanding officer, at least a regimental commander. Depending on the officer who issued the mention, the ribbon of the Croix is marked with extra pins.
* Mentioned in Dispatches:
** a bronze star for those who had been mentioned at the regiment or brigade level.
** a silver star, for those who had been mentioned at the division level.
** a silver-gilt (gold) star for those who had been mentioned at the corps level.
** a bronze palm for those who had been mentioned at the army level.
** a silver palm stands for five bronze ones.
** a silver-gilt (gold) palm for those who had been mentioned at the Free French Forces level (World War II only).

The French Croix de guerre des TOE was created in 1921 for wars fought in theatres of operation outside France. It was awarded during the Indochina War, Korean War, and various wars in the decades that followed. It is the only version of the still considered active, though it has not been presented since the Kosovo War in 1999.

When World War II broke out in 1939, a new was created by Édouard Daladier. It was abolished by Vichy Government in 1941, which created a new . In 1943 General Giraud in Algiers created another . Both the Vichy and Giraud Croix were abolished by General de Gaulle in 1944, who reinstated the 1939 Croix.

The takes precedence between the Ordre national du Mérite and the Croix de la Valeur Militaire, the World War I Croix being senior to the World War II one, itself senior to the TOE Croix.

==Unit award==
The Croix can be awarded to military units, as a manifestation of a collective Mention in Despatches. It is then displayed on the unit&#x27;s flag. A unit, usually a regiment or a battalion, is always mentioned at the army level. The Croix is then a with palm. Other communities, such as cities or companies can be also awarded the Croix.

When a unit is mentioned twice, it is awarded the &quot;fourragère&quot; of the . This &quot;fourragère&quot; is worn by all men in the unit, but it can be worn on a personal basis: those permanently assigned to a unit, at the time of the mentions, were entitled to wear the fourragère for the remainder of service in the military.

Temporary personnel, or those who had joined a unit after the actions which had been mentioned, were authorized to wear the award while a member of the unit but would surrender the decoration upon transfer. This temporary wearing of the fourragère only applied to the French version of the .

The 2nd Battalion Devonshire Regiment of the British Army along with 5 Battery RA were awarded the French with palm for its gallant defence of Bois des Buttes on 27 May 1918, the first day of the Third Battle of the Aisne. The with palm was also awarded to 2nd Battalion Kings Shropshire Light Infantry for Gallantry near Bligny, part of the Second Battle of the Marne. Several other British Army battalions would receive the award before the end of the war.

==United States acceptance==
In the United States military, the was accepted as a foreign decoration. It remains one of the more difficult foreign awards to verify entitlement. The Croix de Guerre unit and individual award were often presented with original orders only and rarely entered into a permanent service record. The 1973 National Archives Fire destroyed most of the World War II personnel records which are needed to verify a veteran&#x27;s entitlement to the Croix de Guerre award. However, foreign unit award entitlements can be checked and verified through official unit history records. Veterans must provide proof of service in the unit cited at the time of action in order to be entitled to the award. Individual foreign awards can be checked through foreign government (France) military records.

Regarding the United States in WWI, on April 10, 12, and 13, 1918, the lines being held by the troops of the 104th Infantry Regiment, of the 26th &quot;Yankee&quot; Division, in Bois Brûlé, near Apremont in the Ardennes, were heavily bombarded and attacked by the Germans. At first the Germans secured a foothold in some advanced trenches which were not strongly held but, thereafter, sturdy counterattacks by the 104th Infantry - at the point of the bayonet - succeeded in driving the enemy out with serious losses, entirely re-establishing the American line. For its gallantry the 104th Infantry was cited in a general order of the French 32nd Army Corps on April 26, 1918. In an impressive ceremony occurring in a field near Boucq on April 28, 1918, the 104th Infantry&#x27;s regimental flag was decorated with the Croix de Guerre by French General Fenelon F.G. Passaga. &quot;I am proud to decorate the flag of a regiment which has shown such fortitude and courage,&quot; he said. &quot;I am proud to decorate the flag of a nation which has come to aid in the fight for liberty.&quot; Thus, the 104th Infantry became the very first American unit to be honored by a foreign country for exceptional bravery in combat. In addition, 117 members of the 104th Infantry received the award, including its commander, Colonel George H. Shelton.

In World War II, the 320th Bombardment Group received the Croix de Guerre avec Palme for action in preparation for and in support of Allied offensive operations in central Italy, April–June 1944. It was the first American unit in this war to be awarded the citation. Members of the 440th AAA AW Battalion (Anti-Aircraft Artillery - Automatic Weapons) of the U.S. Army also received the Croix de Guerre avec Palme (unit award) for stopping the German Ardennes counter-offensive in holding the town of Gouvy, Belgium for 4 days at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge on December 16, 1944. Gouvy is midway between St. Vith and Bastogne. Commanding Officer of the 440th, Lt. Col. Robert O. Stone, and Pfc. Joseph P. Regis, also received an individual award of the Croix de Guerre avec Palme. On June 21, 1945, French General De Gaulle presented the following citation to the 34th United States Infantry Division: &quot;A &#x27;division d&#x27;elite&#x27;, whose loyal and efficient cooperation with French divisions, begun in TUNISIA, was gloriously continued throughout the Italian campaign, in particular during the operations of BELVEDERE when the 34th Division, despite the difficulties of the moment, displayed most courageous efforts in support of the operations of the 3rd Algerian Division. This citation bears with it the award of with Palm.&quot; Soldiers of the US Army 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment &quot;Geronimos&quot; were awarded the with Silver Star, For Service in the Southern France campaign. The 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters by the Germans they killed, were as a unit awarded this medal. 171 members were personally awarded the medal along with the nations highest award, the Legion of Honor. The 509th Unit colors bear the Streamer embroidered &quot;MUY EN PROVENCE&quot;.

On March 30, 1951, the President of the French Republic, Vincent Auriol, pinned not only the with Palm but also the Legion of Honour on the flag of the Brigade of Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy in recognition of historic contributions of the Naval Academy, particularly the contributions of alumni to victory in World War II. The flag of the Brigade of Midshipmen does not display streamers for either award, nor do Midshipmen wear the fourragère, despite apparent entitlement to do both.

Today, members of several US Army and Marine Corps units that received the fourragère for combat service during World Wars I and/or II are authorized to wear the award while assigned to the unit. Upon transfer from the unit the individual is no longer authorized to wear the fourragère. Wearing of the decoration is considered ceremonial only and it is not entered as an official military individual or unit award in the service member&#x27;s permanent service records.
Units currently authorized to wear the French fourragère are:

<text>Henry Sacheverell (; 8 February 1674 – 5 June 1724) was an English high church Anglican clergyman who achieved nationwide fame in 1709 after preaching an incendiary 5 November sermon. He was subsequently impeached by the House of Commons and though he was found guilty, his light punishment was seen as a vindication and he became a popular figure in the country, contributing to the Tories&#x27; landslide victory at the general election of 1710.
== Early life ==
The son of Joshua Sacheverell, rector of St Peter&#x27;s, Marlborough, he was adopted by his godfather, Edward Hearst, and his wife after Joshua&#x27;s death in 1684. His maternal grandfather, Henry Smith, after whom he was possibly named, may be the same Henry Smith who is recorded as a signatory of Charles I&#x27;s death warrant. His relations included what he labelled his &quot;fanatic kindred&quot;; his great-grandfather John was a rector, three of whose sons were Presbyterians. One of these sons, John (Sacheverell&#x27;s grandfather), was ejected from his vicarage at the Restoration and died in prison after being convicted for preaching at a Dissenting meeting. He was more proud of distant relatives who were Midlands landed gentry that had supported the Royalist cause during the Civil War.

The Hearsts were pious High Anglicans and were pleased with Sacheverell, who was &quot;always retiring to his private devotions before he went to school&quot;. He was educated at Marlborough Grammar School from 1684 to 1689. He was sent to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1689, where he was a student until 1701 and a fellow from 1701 to 1713. Joseph Addison, another native of Wiltshire, had entered the same college two years earlier. It was at Sacheverell&#x27;s instigation that Addison wrote his &quot;Account of the Greatest English Poets&quot; (1694) and he dedicated it to Sacheverell. Sacheverell took his degree of B.A. on 30 June 1693, and became M.A. on 16 May 1695.

The Bishop of Oxford, John Hough, ordained him deacon on 18 May 1695. However, when, in 1697, he presented himself to the Bishop of Lichfield, William Lloyd, with a reference from the dean of Lichfield, Lloyd complained of his grammatically incorrect Latin. Sacheverell, who had published several Latin poems, quoted Latin grammars to verify his Latin and apparently told Lloyd it was &quot;better Latin than he or any of his chaplains could make&quot;. Lloyd sent his secretary to his library to prove Sacheverell wrong but failed to do so.

In 1696, he was appointed chaplain to Sir Charles Holte and curate for Aston parish church. However, when the Aston living fell vacant, Holte refused to appoint Sacheverell. Holte&#x27;s wife years later claimed this was because Sacheverell &quot;was exceedingly light and foolish, without any of that gravity and seriousness which became one in holy orders; &quot;that he was fitter to make a player than a clergyman&quot;; that in particular, he was dangerous in a family, since he would among the very servants jest upon the torments of Hell&quot;. Lancelot Addison, the dean of Lichfield and the father of Joseph, nominated him to the small vicarage of Cannock in Staffordshire and after an intense three-day examination, Lloyd was finally convinced Sacheverell was ready and accepted his nomination in September 1697. Sacheverell was threatened with prosecution for seditious libel after preaching a fiery sermon but this was dropped due to Sacheverell&#x27;s unimportance.

In July 1701, he was elected Fellow of Magdalen College but his overbearing, disrespectful self-confidence and arrogance won him few friends. In 1709 before his two famous sermons, Thomas Hearne dismissed him as a loud-mouthed wine-soaker. However he was a hard worker and an active teacher, being promoted to a variety of offices. In June 1703, he was appointed to an endowed lectureship; in 1703 he was appointed College Librarian; in 1708 was appointed Senior Dean of Arts and in 1709 he became Bursar.

Sacheverell first achieved notability as a High Church preacher in May 1702 when he gave a sermon entitled &quot;The Political Union&quot;, on the necessity of the union between church and state, and denigrating Dissenters, occasional conformists and their Whig supporters. His peroration included an appeal to Anglicans not to &quot;strike sail to a party which is an open and avowed enemy to our communion&quot; but instead to &quot;hang out the bloody flag and banner of defiance&quot;. Gaining a small London readership, Daniel Defoe labelled Sacheverell &quot;the bloody flag officer&quot; and in his &quot;The Shortest Way with the Dissenters&quot; he included in its subtitle an acknowledgement of &quot;Mr Sach—ll&#x27;s sermon and others&quot;. John Dennis also replied to Sacheverell in &quot;The Danger of Priestcraft to Religion and Government&quot;.

Roger Mander, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, appointed Sacheverell to preach the University Sermon on 10 June 1702, the date chosen by Queen Anne as a Fast Day for Heaven&#x27;s blessing for British success in the new war against France. In support of the Tory candidate at the 1702 English general election, Sir John Pakington, 4th Baronet, Sacheverell published &quot;The Character of a Low-Church-Man&quot;. This attacked William Lloyd and advised the clergy to be on the look out against &quot;false brethren&quot; within the Church. Pakington was grateful and recommended Sacheverell to Robert Harley as Speaker&#x27;s chaplain. Harley, a moderate Tory with a Dissenting background, declined.

Only two other sermons in this period were printed: &quot;The Nature and Mischief of Prejudice and Partiality&quot; (1704) and &quot;The Nature, Guilt and Danger of Presumptuous Sins&quot; (1708). With two other Oxford dons he wrote &quot;The Rights of the Church of England Asserted and Proved&quot; (1705). The first sermon led to a further notice by Defoe that &quot;Mr Sacheverell of Oxford has blown his second trumpet to let us know he has not yet taken down his bloody flag&quot;. During the &quot;Church in Danger&quot; scare of 1705-06 he preached a sermon in which he (according to Hearne) with &quot;a great deal of courage and boldness&quot; showed &quot;the great danger the Church is in ... from the fanatics and other false brethren, whom he set forth in their proper colours&quot;.

In July 1708 he was awarded a Doctorate of Divinity, possibly due to his abilities as a preacher as well as for his teaching. In March 1709 a local brewer named John Lade suggested to Sacheverell that he put himself forward for the vacant office of chaplain at St Saviour&#x27;s, Southwark. He campaigned for the post with such vigour that a fellow clergyman wrote &quot;None is so much talked of as he all over the Town. I suppose we shall have him very speedily the subject of de Foe&#x27;s &quot;Review&quot;, in which he has formerly had the honour of being substantially abused&quot;. His most notable backers were Lord Weymouth and Sir William Trumbull. News of his candidacy alarmed the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison, and aroused opposition from the Dissenters, as Trumbull&#x27;s nephew wrote: &quot;[They] give out that if they can keep him out this time, they shall for ever keep him from coming into the City&quot;. However Sacheverell was appointed by 28 votes to 19 on 24 May. Tenison was &quot;much troubled&quot; by this.

Sacheverell soon stirred up more controversy by printing a sermon he had been invited to deliver at Derby Assizes on 15 August, entitled &quot;The Communication of Sin&quot;. The sermon was in the same vein as his previous ones but it was the dedication to the printed version (published on 27 October) that particularly antagonised the Whigs:
Now, when the principles and interests of our Church and constitution are so shamefully betrayed and run down, it can be no little comfort to all those who wish their welfare and security to see that, notwithstanding the secret malice and open violence they are persecuted with, there are still to be found such worthy patrons of both who dare own and defend them, as well against the rude and presumptuous insults of the one side as the base, undermining treachery of the other, and who scorn to sit silently by and partake in the sins of these associated malignants.

== &quot;The Perils of False Brethren&quot; ==

The new Lord Mayor of London, Sir Samuel Garrard, 4th Baronet, was a zealous Tory and it was his responsibility to appoint the preacher for the annual 5 November sermon to the City Fathers at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral to commemorate the failure of the Gunpowder Plot. Garrard later claimed no acquaintance with Sacheverell, knowing him only by reputation. Whigs later claimed that Sacheverell was hired as a tool of the Tory party to deliver the sermon. The historian Geoffrey Holmes claims there is no evidence for this as Sacheverell&#x27;s papers were destroyed after his death but that it was in Sacheverell&#x27;s character to deliver the sermon off his own bat.

Sacheverell&#x27;s audience included thirty clergymen and a large number of Jacobites and Nonjurors. Prior to the sermon, prayers and hymns were delivered. A witness saw Sacheverell, sitting with the clergy, working himself up into an angry mood, describing &quot;the fiery red that overspread his face ... and the goggling wildness of his eyes ... he came into the pulpit like a Sybil to the mouth of her cave&quot;. The title of his sermon, &quot;The Perils of False Brethren, in Church, and State&quot;, derived from 2 Corinthians 11:26.

The 5 November was an important day in the Whig calendar, both the day of the Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605 and William of Orange&#x27;s landing at Torbay on 5 November 1688. Whigs claimed both these days as a double deliverance from &quot;popery&quot;. Sacheverell compared the Gunpowder Plot not to 1688 but to the date of the execution of Charles I, 30 January 1649. Sacheverell claimed that these two events demonstrated the &quot;rage and bloodthirstiness of both the popish and fanatick enemies of our Church and Government... These TWO DAYS indeed are but one united proof and visible testimonial of the same dangerous and rebellious principles these confederates in iniquity maintain&quot;. The threat to the Church from Catholics was dealt with in three minutes; the rest of the one-and-a-half-hour sermon was an attack on Dissenters and the &quot;false brethren&quot; who aided them in menacing church and state. He claimed that the Church of England resembled the Church of Corinth in St Paul&#x27;s days: &quot;her holy communion ... rent and divided by factious and schismatical impostors; her pure doctrine ... corrupted and defiled; her primitive worship and discipline profaned and abused; her sacred orders denied and vilified; her priests and professors (like St Paul) calumniated, misrepresented and ridiculed; her altars and sacraments prostituted to hypocrites, Deists, Socinians and atheists&quot;.

Sacheverell identified the false brethren in the Church as those who promoted heretical views, such as Unitarians and those who would revise the Church&#x27;s official articles of faith, and those who presumed &quot;to recede the least tittle from the express word of God, or to explain the great credenda of our Faith in new-fangled terms of modern philosophy&quot;. Then there those who wanted to change the worship of the Church, the latitudinarians who promoted toleration and denied that schism was sinful, taking &quot;all occasions to comply with the dissenters both in public and private affairs, as persons of tender consciences and piety&quot;. The false brethren in state Sacheverell saw as those who denied &quot;the steady belief in the subject&#x27;s obligation to absolute and unconditional Obedience to the Supreme Power in all things lawful, and the utter illegality of Resistance upon any pretence whatsoever&quot;: &quot;Our adversaries think they effectually stop our mouths, and have us sure and unanswerable on this point, when they urge the revolution of this day in their defence. But certainly they are the greatest enemies of that, and his late Majesty, and the most ungrateful for the deliverance, who endeavour to cast such black and odious colours upon both&quot;. He attacked Dissenting academies as places where &quot;all the Hellish principles of fanaticism, regicide and anarchy are openly professed and taught&quot; and attacked occasional conformity as giving disloyal elements bases of official power.

These false brethren were working to &quot;weaken, undermine and betray in themselves, and encourage and put it in the power of our professed enemies to overturn and destroy, the constitution and establishment of both&quot;. In due course the Church would lose its character and become a &quot;heterogeneous mixture&quot; united only by Protestantism. He then claimed that &quot;this spurious and villainous notion, which will take in Jews, Quakers, Mahometans and anything, as well as Christians&quot;. This had been tried when the Church&#x27;s enemies had advocated Comprehension and now the same people were using &quot;Moderation and Occasional Conformity&quot; to destroy the defences of the Church. The end result would be an Erastian state of affairs where people became nonplussed about questions of faith and fall prey to &quot;universal scepticism and infidelity&quot;. The Occasionally Conforming Dissenters Sacheverell saw as the enemy within. He called the Toleration Act 1688 the &quot;Indulgence&quot; and &quot;that the old leaven of their forefathers is still working&quot; in the present Dissenting generation: he called them a &quot;brood of vipers&quot; and asked &quot;whether these men are not contriving and plotting our utter ruin, and whether all those False Brethren that fall in with these measures and designs do not contribute basely to it? ... I pray God we may be out of danger, but we may remember the King&#x27;s person was voted to be so at the same time that his murderers were conspiring his death&quot;.

Sacheverell pointed to the sinfulness of the false brethren. For Anglicans holding office it was a betrayal of their oaths; secondly, it was an example of hypocrisy and disregarding of principle for material gain. He said it was a &quot;vast scandal and offence ... to see men of characters and stations thus shift and prevaricate with their principles&quot;, like Christ&#x27;s disciples when Christ&#x27;s life was at stake. He attacked &quot;the crafty insidiousness of such wily Volpones&quot;. &quot;Volpone&quot; was the nickname of Sidney Godolphin, a Tory who had allied himself with the Whig Junto and who had been attacked by Tories as an apostate. The prospect for these false brethren, Sacheverell claimed, was to take &quot;his portion with hypocrites and unbelievers, with all liars, that have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone&quot;.

Sacheverell ended the sermon by exhorting Anglicans to close ranks, to present &quot;an army of banners to our enemies&quot; and hope that the false brethren &quot;would throw off the mask, entirely quit the Church of which they are no true members, and not fraudulently eat her bread and lay wait for her ruin&quot;. High-ranking clergy must excommunicate offenders &quot;and let any power on earth dare reverse a sentence ratified in Heaven&quot;. A long battle lay ahead for the Church Militant, &quot;against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places&quot;. That the battle would be hard was accepted &quot;because her adversaries are chief and her enemies at present prosper&quot;. However he did not doubt that the battle must be joined, knowing that &quot;there is a God that can and will raise her up, if we forsake her not&quot;: &quot;Now the God of all Grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen&quot;.

== Reaction ==

As Sacheverell left St Paul&#x27;s and travelled through the City, he was cheered by a crowd. The joke doing the rounds was that &quot;St Paul&#x27;s was on fire a Saturday&quot;. Sacheverell prepared the sermon for publication and consulted three lawyers, who all claimed it breached neither common or civil law. On 25 November the sermon was printed, the first edition being 500 copies. On 1 December the second edition came off the press and numbered between 30,000 and 40,000 copies. By the end of Sacheverell&#x27;s trial, an estimated 100,000 copies of his sermon were in circulation. A conservative estimate of the readership, 250,000 people, was equal to the whole electorate of Britain at that time. This had no parallel in early eighteenth-century Britain.

For the first few weeks, many Whigs believed that the sermon was beneath official response. Defoe wrote that &quot;the roaring of this beast ought to give you no manner of disturbance. You ought to laugh at him, let him alone; he&#x27;ll vent his gall, and then he&#x27;ll be quiet&quot;. Within three days of the sermon being on sale, pamphlet responses were being printed. George Ridpath&#x27;s &quot;The Peril of Being Zealously Affected, but not Well&quot; attacked Sacheverell, as did White Kennett&#x27;s &quot;True Answer&quot;. The Whig author of &quot;High Church Display&#x27;d&quot; claimed that Sacheverell &quot;and his party were entirely routed in those paper-skirmishes&quot;. It took six weeks before a pamphlet defence of Sacheverell was published, and thereafter they became numerous.

On the last Sunday of November Sacheverell preached at St Margaret&#x27;s, Lothbury. The church was packed to full attendance, with an enormous crowd outside threatening to break open the church for a chance to hear him preach. With his sermon now in massive circulation, the Whig government considered prosecuting Sacheverell. In his sermon Sacheverell had gone further than most High Church preachers in minimising the Glorious Revolution and extolling the doctrine of non-resistance, as well as challenging Parliament by his remarks on the Toleration Act and Parliament&#x27;s December 1705 resolution declaring the Church to be in no danger. He had also attacked a leading member of the government, Godolphin. However, when the government lawyers examined the sermon, they discovered that Sacheverell had chosen his words carefully to such an extent that they considered it uncertain whether he could be prosecuted for sedition. They considered bringing Sacheverell to the Commons&#x27; Bar on the charge of displaying contempt for the Commons resolution of December 1705. A vote in the Commons would be enough to convict him. However this approach would deny the Whigs the publicity they sought in prosecuting Sacheverell and he would be at liberty once the Commons&#x27; session ended. The Whigs wanted a punishment sufficient enough to deter other High Churchmen. A vote in the House of Lords on a charge of high crimes and misdemeanours had the power to achieve what the Whigs wanted and could also inflict a heavy fine with confiscation of goods and imprisonment for life.

On 13 December the Commons ordered Sacheverell to attend the Bar of the House. On 14 December Sacheverell appeared before the Commons with a hundred other clergymen also in attendance to show moral support. The House resolved that Sacheverell be impeached and he was put into the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms. He was visited at his lodgings in Peters Street by prominent Tories such as the Duke of Leeds, Lord Rochester and Duke of Buckingham. The Duke of Beaufort sent him claret and 50 guineas. Although the Tories in the Commons managed only 64 votes on behalf of Sacheverell&#x27;s petition for bail, there was an outbreak of support for him amongst the Anglican clergy. The Duke of Marlborough remarked that &quot;the whole body of the inferior clergy espouse his interest&quot;.

== Trial ==
Sacheverell&#x27;s impeachment trial lasted from 27 February to 21 March 1710 and the verdict was that he should be suspended for three years and that the two sermons should be burnt at the Royal Exchange. This was the decree of the state, and it had the effect of making him a martyr in the eyes of the populace and bringing about the first Sacheverell riots that year in London and the rest of the country, which included attacks on Presbyterian and other Dissenter places of worship, with some being burned down. The rioting in turn led to the downfall of the government ministry later that year and the passing of the Riot Act in 1714.

== Progress ==

The tide of public opinion had turned in Sacheverell&#x27;s favour and the people viewed his light punishment as a deliverance for the whole Church of England. He became &quot;the saviour of the Church and the nation&#x27;s martyr-hero&quot;. From 21–23 March almost all major streets in Westminster and west London celebrated by bonfires, illuminated windows and toasts to Sacheverell and the Queen accompanied by the ringing of church bells. The Trained Bands had to be called out due to growing disturbances and in Southwark a new riot was not ended until after 30 March. Across the country there were celebrations in support for Sacheverell, with bonfires, illuminated windows and the ringing of church bells. When Sacheverell went to thank the peers who had voted for him who were still in London, &quot;he was huzza&#x27;d by the mob like a prize-fighter&quot;.

Despite the suspension from preaching, Sacheverell was presented to a living in Shropshire on 26 June 1710 as Rector of Selattyn near Oswestry by a former Cambridge student of his, Robert Lloyd, local landowner and later an MP for Shropshire. He held his living until 1713.

Sacheverell travelled to Selattyn in June in what Holmes called &quot;the most extraordinary Progress ever made by a private individual in Britain&quot;. Richard Steele wrote that &quot;the anarchic fury ran so high that Harry Sacheverell swelling, and Jack Huggins laughing, marched through England in a triumph more than military&quot;. On 15 May he left London for Oxford with a cavalcade of 66 horsemen, increasing to 300 by the time he reached Uxbridge, with hundreds more when he went through Beaconsfield, High Wycombe and West Wycombe. When he reached Wheatley near Oxford, Lord Abingdon, the local MP Thomas Rowney, noblemen, Heads of Houses, the Proctors, most Oxford Fellows and others welcomed Sacheverell to Oxford University. He remained at Magdalen College for a fortnight before leaving Oxford on 1 June, taking over four weeks to reach Selattyn (passing through Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Denbighshire and Flintshire) and just under three weeks to travel back to Oxford (going through Shropshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire). This included twelve towns and he was honoured with ten civic receptions. He was given fifty vast dinners, numerable lavish suppers, including at least 22 private dinners. Their hosts included Lord Denbigh at Newnham Paddox, Lord Leigh at Stoneleigh Abbey, Lord Willoughby de Broke, Lord Kilmorey, Lord Folliot, William Bromley at Baginton, Sir William Boughton at Lawford Park, Sir Edward Cobb, Sir Edward Aston and Sir Charles Holte at Aston.

Sacheverell and his entourage spent only seven nights in local inns as Tory landowners put their houses at his disposal. He spent ten days with Lord Craven at Coombe Abbey, then went to New Hall Manor owned by his kinsman George Sacheverell. He stayed with Richard Dyott, Sir Edward Bagot at Blithfield Hall, the Bishop of Chester (Sir William Dawes, 3rd Baronet), George Shacklerley at Crossford, Sir Richard Myddelton at Chirk Castle, Roger Owen at Condover Hall, Whitmore Acton, Lord Kilmorey, Berkerley Green at Cotheridge Court and Sir John Walter at Sarsden. At every house he stayed, local gentry and clergy paid him homage. Sacheverell was also attended by the multitude. At Coventry, 5000 people welcomed him into the city. At Birmingham he was greeted by 300-500 horse and 3000–4000 foot. Between 5000 and 7000 greeted him at Shrewsbury headed by an enormous cavalcade of gentry and yeomen. The church bells rang from five in the morning until eleven at night. At Bridgnorth, 64 clergymen, 3500 horse and 3000 foot welcomed him. On 19 July Sacheverell returned to Oxford.

By 8 August, the date of Godolphin&#x27;s dismissal, there had been sent to the Queen 97 Tory addresses couched in High Church Anglican language. On 30 June the Bishop of Worcester William Lloyd wrote of &quot;the great danger we are brought into by the turbulent preaching and practices of an impudent man ... now riding in triumph over the middle of England, everywhere stirring up the people to address to her Majesty for a new Parliament. The danger is so great that I cannot but tremble to think of it, if her Majesty should dissolve the present Parliament and change her ministry, which is the thing driven at by the addresses&quot;. The general election held in October/November 1710 was fought by the Tory-Anglican clergy and gentry on the same platform which Sacheverell stood seven months before. In Cornwall the two victorious Tory candidates, John Trevanion and George Granville, were swept to victory on the back of the chant: &quot;Trevanion and Granville, sound as a bell/For the Queen, the Church, and Sacheverell&quot;. Only ten managers of Sacheverell&#x27;s prosecution were re-elected and Tories circulated division lists of those who had voted for or against Sacheverell. His influence was all-pervasive, being linked to the safety of the Church and on the lips of election mobs, with his portrait being a favourite emblem of Tories. The election was a personal triumph for Sacheverell as well as a Tory landslide, with the anti-Whig reaction especially marked in counties where Sacheverell had passed during his Progress.

== Later life ==

Sacheverell&#x27;s sentence expired on 23 March 1713. The reaction in London was muted compared to the celebrations in the provincial towns such as Worcester, Norwich, Wells and Frome where the steeples were decked with flags, windows were decorated with streamers along with bonfires and people singing in the streets. On 29 March Sacheverell preached at St Saviour&#x27;s for the first time since his ban expired and the enormous crowd who came to see him was described as &quot;inconceivable to those who did not see it, and inexpressible to those who did&quot;. He took as his text Luke 23:34, &quot;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do&quot; and titled it &quot;The Christian Triumph: or The Duty of Praying for our Enemies&quot;. Despite the provocative title, as White Kennett wrote, &quot;there was little mischief in it&quot; and it sold only half the 30,000 copies printed. Jonathan Swift called it a &quot;long dull sermon&quot;. On 13 April 1713 it was announced he was to be instituted to the valuable rectory of St Andrew&#x27;s, Holborn. On 29 May 1713 he was appointed to preach the sermon for the anniversary of the Restoration at the House of Commons, titled &quot;False Notions of Liberty in Religion and Government destructive of both&quot;. He attacked his Whig persecutors as &quot;traitorous, heady and high-minded men&quot; and upheld the doctrine of non-resistance. In December 1713 he preached at St Paul&#x27;s to the Corporation for the Sons of the Clergy but his procession was hissed by the crowd at the Royal Exchange.

Upon the death of Queen Anne and the accession of the first Hanoverian monarch George I, the Duke of Marlborough made a public procession back to London. Sacheverell achieved renewed fame by attacking this as &quot;an unparalleled insolence and a vile trampling upon royal ashes&quot;. When the London clergy presented loyal addresses to the new king at court in September, Sacheverell was sent away by vocal attacks by Whigs and &quot;getting to the outward door, the footmen hissed him on a long lane on both sides till he got into a coach&quot;.

Sacheverell left London and went on a new Progress through Oxford, Wiltshire and Warwickshire. An outbreak of rioting occurred in protest against George&#x27;s coronation in October and Sacheverell&#x27;s name was extolled by the rioters. At Bristol the crowd shouted &quot;Sacheverell and Ormond, and damn all foreigners!&quot;; in Taunton they cried &quot;Church and Dr. Sacheverell&quot;; at Birmingham, &quot;Kill the old Rogue [King George], Kill them all, Sacheverell for ever&quot;; at Tewkesbury, &quot;Sacheverell for ever, Down with the Roundheads&quot;; at Shrewsbury, &quot;High Church and Sacheverell for ever&quot;. In Dorchester and Nuneaton, Sacheverell&#x27;s health was drunk. Eleven days after the riots, Sacheverell published an open letter:

The Dissenters &amp; their Friends have foolishly Endeavour&#x27;d to raise a Disturbance throughout the whole Kingdom by Trying in most Great Towns, on the Coronation Day to Burn Me in Effigie, to Inodiate my Person &amp; Cause with the Populace: But if this Silly Stratagem has produc&#x27;d a quite Contrary Effect, &amp; turn&#x27;s upon the First Authors, &amp; aggressors, and the People have Express&#x27;d their Resentment in any Culpable way, I hope it is not to be laid to my Charge, whose Name...they make Use of as &quot;the Shibboleth of the Party&quot;.

The Bishop of London, John Robinson, ordered him back to Holborn and warned him against politicking. During the general election held in January–March 1715, the slogan &quot;High Church and Sacheverell&quot; was used by Tories. In the aftermath of the heavy Tory defeat, Sacheverell may have flirted with Jacobitism but he did not take up the invitation from the Pretender&#x27;s court in Rome that he should settle there. Another set of rioting broke out in the spring and summer of 1715. On the anniversary of Anne&#x27;s succession, 8 March, the mob at St Andrew&#x27;s burned a picture of William of Orange, broke windows which were not illuminated in celebration and proposed &quot;to sing the Second Part of the &quot;Sacheverell-Tune&quot;, by pulling down [Dissenting] Meeting Houses&quot;. They were persuaded not to do so, however. On 10 June the Dissenting chapel in Cross Street, Manchester was sacked by a mob chanting Sacheverell&#x27;s name. In May 1717 a riot broke out in Oxford when the Whig Constitution Club tried to burn Sacheverell in effigy, which was prevented by the mob.

Sacheverell inherited the manor of Callow in Derbyshire in the summer of 1715 after George Sacheverell died. He married George&#x27;s widow Mary in June 1716 and took possession of the estate in 1717. He purchased a landed estate in Wilden, Bedfordshire and in 1720 bought an elegant house in South Grove, Highgate, London.

In January 1723 he slipped on the icy doorstep of his Highgate home and broke two ribs. Henry Sacheverell died at his Highgate house on 5 June 1724. He was buried at St Andrew&#x27;s in the vault. The house was later occupied by the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and is now owned by Kate Moss.

== Legacy ==
Writing later in the eighteenth century, the Whig member of parliament Edmund Burke used the speeches of Whig leaders at the Sacheverell trial in his &quot;An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs&quot; (1791) to demonstrate true Whiggism (as opposed to the beliefs of the Foxite &#x27;New Whigs&#x27;).

Historian Greg Jenner asserts in his &quot;Dead Famous: An Unexpected History of Celebrity from Bronze Age to Silver Screen&quot; (2020, W&amp;N ) that Sacheverell was the first example of a celebrity.

<text>, formerly , is a Japanese film production and distribution company. In the past, the company has distributed video games. It was formed in 1997 through a merger between the Asmik Corporation and Ace Entertainment, both in Japan. The name Asmik comes from its three founding companies: Ask (formerly ASK-Kodansha), Sumitomo and Kodansha. The company is headquartered on the third floor of the Lapiross Roppongi building in Minato, Tokyo, and is a wholly owned division of Jupiter Telecommunications (J:COM).

Asmik Corporation was founded in 1985 as a subsidiary of the Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. Its focus was in the area of video games for the video game console market, specifically the NES. It quickly moved on to distribute motion pictures in Japan, and won several awards for doing so. It once had a North American subsidiary, Asmik Corporation of America.

Ace Pictures Inc. was founded in 1981 as a division of Nippon Herald Films to produce Japanese films and distribute foreign art films. Several of its pictures earned awards and hold positions as some of the highest-grossing films in Japan.

Asmik Ace Entertainment has produced games for the Dreamcast, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PC Engine, Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, Nintendo 64, and GameCube, and distributes high quality films for the Japanese movie market.

Asmik Ace Entertainment also distributed a number of DreamWorks Pictures and DreamWorks Animation films to Japanese cinemas.

<doc id="313830" wikidata="Q131677" url="?curid=313830" title="Bulldozer">
<text>A bulldozer or dozer (also called a crawler) is a large, motorized machine equipped with a metal blade to the front for pushing material: soil, sand, snow, rubble, or rock during construction work. It travels most commonly on continuous tracks, though specialized models riding on large off-road tires are also produced. Its most popular accessory is a ripper, a large hook-like device mounted singly or in multiples in the rear to loosen dense materials. 

Bulldozers are used heavily in large and small scale construction, road building, minings and quarrying, on farms, in heavy industry factories, and in military applications in both peace and wartime.

The word &quot;bulldozer&quot; refers only to a motorized unit fitted with a blade designed for pushing. The word is sometimes used inaccurately for other heavy equipment such as a front-end loader designed for carrying rather than pushing material. The term originally referred only to the blade attachment but is now commonly applied to any crawler tractor with a front mounted blade.

== Description ==

Typically, bulldozers are large and powerful tracked heavy equipment. The tracks give them excellent traction and mobility through very rough terrain. Wide tracks also help distribute the vehicle&#x27;s weight over a large area (decreasing ground pressure), thus preventing it from sinking in sandy or muddy ground. Extra-wide tracks are known as swamp tracks or low ground pressure (lgp) tracks. Bulldozers have transmission systems designed to take advantage of the track system and provide excellent tractive force.

These traits allow bulldozers to excel in road building, construction, mining, forestry, land clearing, infrastructure development, and any other projects requiring highly mobile, powerful, and stable earth-moving equipment.

A variant is the all-wheel-drive wheeled bulldozer, which generally has four large rubber-tired wheels, hydraulically operated articulated steering, and a hydraulically actuated blade mounted forward of the articulation joint.

The bulldozer&#x27;s primary tools are the blade and the ripper:
=== Blade ===

Bulldozer blades come in three types:
* straight (&quot;S blade&quot;), short with no lateral curve or side wings. Can be used for fine grading.
* universal (&quot;U blade&quot;), tall and very curved, with large side wings to maximize load.
* combination (&quot;S-U&quot;, or semi-U), shorter, with less curvature and smaller side wings. It is typically used for pushing large rocks, as at a quarry.

Blades can be fitted straight across the frame, or at an angle. All can be lifted, some, with additional hydraulic cylinders, can be tilted to vary the angle up to one side.

Sometimes, a bulldozer is used to push or pull another piece of earth-moving equipment known as a &quot;scraper&quot; to increase productivity. The towed Fresno Scraper, invented in 1883 by James Porteous, was the first design to enable this to be done economically, removing the soil from an area being cut and depositing where needed as fill. Dozer blades with a reinforced center section for pushing are known as &quot;bull blades&quot;.

Dozer blades are added to combat engineering vehicles and other military equipment, such as artillery tractors such as the Type 73 or M8 tractor, to clear battlefield obstacles and prepare firing positions. Dozer blades may be mounted on main battle tanks to clear antitank obstacles or mines, and dig improvised shelters.

=== Ripper ===
A ripper is a long, claw-like shank that may be mounted singly or in multiples on the rear of a bulldozer to loosen hard and impacted materials. Usually a single shank is preferred for heavy ripping. The ripper is equipped with a replaceable tungsten steel alloy tip, known as a boot.

Ripping can not only loosen soil (such as podzol hardpan) in agricultural and construction applications but break shaly rock or pavement into easily handled small rubble. 

A variant of the ripper is the stumpbuster, a single spike protruding horizontally used to split a tree stump.

== Variants ==
=== Armored bulldozers ===
Bulldozers employed for combat-engineering roles are often fitted with armor to protect the driver from firearms and debris, enabling bulldozers to operate in combat zones. The most widely documented use is the Israeli Military militarized Caterpillar D9, for earth moving, clearing terrain obstacles, opening routes, and detonating explosive charges. The IDF used armoured bulldozers extensively during Operation Rainbow where they were used to uproot Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels and destroy residential neighbourhoods, water wells and pipes, and agricultural land to expand the military buffer zone along the Philadelphi Route. This use drew criticism against both the use and the suppliers of armoured bulldozers from human-rights organizations such as the EWASH-coalition and Human Rights Watch, the latter of whom urged Caterpillar to cease their sale of bulldozers to the IDF. The use of bulldozers was seen as necessary by Israeli authorities to uproot smuggling tunnels, destroy houses used by Palestinian gunmen, and expand the buffer zone.

Some forces&#x27; engineer doctrines differentiate between a low-mobility armoured dozer (LMAD) and a high-mobility armoured dozer (HMAD). The LMAD is dependent on a flatbed to move it to its employment site, whereas the HMAD has a more robust engine and drive system designed to give it road mobility with a moderate range and speed. HMADs, however, normally lack the full cross-country mobility characteristics of a dozer blade-equipped tank or armoured personnel carrier.

Some bulldozers have been fitted with armor by civilian operators to prevent bystanders or police from interfering with the work performed by the bulldozer, as in the case of strikes or demolition of condemned buildings. This has also been done by civilians with a dispute with the authorities, such as Marvin Heemeyer, who outfitted his Komatsu D355A bulldozer with homemade composite armor to then demolish government buildings.

=== Remote-controlled dozers ===
In recent years, innovations in the construction technology have made remote-controlled bulldozers a reality. Now, heavy machinery can be controlled from up to 1,000 feet away. This contributes to the safety of workers on the jobsite, keeping them at a secure distance from potentially dangerous jobs.

The advancement and the ability to control the heavy machinery from afar provides workers with the sufficient control over the dozers to get the job done. Though these machines are still in their early stages, many construction companies are using them successfully.

The first bulldozers were adapted from Holt farm tractors that were used to plough fields. The versatility of tractors in soft ground for logging and road building contributed to the development of the armored tank in World War I.

In 1923, farmer James Cummings and draftsman J. Earl McLeod made the first designs for the bulldozer. A replica is on display at the city park in Morrowville, Kansas, where the two built the first bulldozer. On December 18, 1923, Cummings and McLeod filed U.S. patent #1,522,378 that was later issued on January 6, 1925, for an &quot;Attachment for Tractors.&quot;

By the 1920s, tracked vehicles became common, particularly the Caterpillar 60. Rubber-tired vehicles came into use in the 1940s. To dig canals, raise earthen dams, and do other earth-moving jobs, these tractors were equipped with a large, thick, metal plate in front. (The blade got its curved shape later). In some early models, the driver sat on top in the open without a cabin. The three main types of bulldozer blades are a U-blade for pushing and carrying soil relatively long distances, a straight blade for &quot;knocking down&quot; and spreading piles of soil, and a brush rake for removing brush and roots. These attachments (home-built or built by small equipment manufacturers of attachments for wheeled and crawler tractors and trucks) appeared by 1929.

Widespread acceptance of the bull-grader does not seem to appear before the mid-1930s. The addition of power down-force provided by hydraulic cylinders instead of just the weight of the blade made them the preferred excavation machine for large and small contractors alike by the 1940s, by which time the term &quot;bulldozer&quot; referred to the entire machine and not just the attachment.

Over the years, bulldozers got bigger and more powerful in response to the demand for equipment suited for ever larger earthworks. Firms such as Caterpillar, Komatsu, Clark Equipment Co, Case, Euclid, Allis Chalmers, Liebherr, LiuGong, Terex, Fiat-Allis, John Deere, Massey Ferguson, BEML, XGMA, and International Harvester manufactured large, tracked-type earthmoving machines. R.G. LeTourneau and Caterpillar manufactured large, rubber-tired bulldozers.

Bulldozers grew more sophisticated as time passed. Improvements include drivetrains analogous to (in automobiles) an automatic transmission instead of a manual transmission, such as the early Euclid C-6 and TC-12 or Model C Tournadozer, blade movement controlled by hydraulic cylinders or electric motors instead of early models&#x27; cable winch/brake, and automatic grade control. Hydraulic cylinders enabled the application of down force, more precise manipulation of the blade, and automated controls.

In the very snowy winter of 1946–47 in the United Kingdom, in at least one case a remote cut-off village running out of food was supplied by a bulldozer towing a big sled carrying necessary supplies.

A more recent innovation is the outfitting of bulldozers with GPS technology, such as manufactured by Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc., Trimble Inc, or Leica Geosystems, for precise grade control and (potentially) &quot;stakeless&quot; construction. As a response to the many, and often varying claims about these systems, the Kellogg Report published in 2010 a detailed comparison of all the manufacturers&#x27; systems, evaluating more than 200 features for dozers alone.

The best-known maker of bulldozers is Caterpillar. Komatsu, Liebherr, Case, Hitachi, Volvo, and John Deere are present-day competitors. Although these machines began as modified farm tractors, they became the mainstay for big civil construction projects, and found their way into use by military construction units worldwide. The best-known model, the Caterpillar D9, was also used to clear mines and demolish enemy structures.

==Manufacturers==
Industry statistics based on 2010 production published by &quot;Off-Highway Research&quot; showed Shantui was the largest producer of bulldozers, making over 10,000 units that year or two in five crawler-type dozers made in the world. The next-largest producer by number of units is Caterpillar Inc., which produced 6,400 units.

Komatsu introduced the D575A in 1981, the D757A-2 in 1991, and the D575A-3 in 2002, which the company touts as the biggest bulldozer in the world.

== History of the word ==
* A 19th-century term used in engineering for a horizontal forging press
* Around 1870s: In the USA, a &quot;bulldose&quot; was a large dose (namely, one large enough to be literally or figuratively effective against a bull) of any sort of medicine or punishment. 
*By the late 1870s, &quot;to bulldoze&quot; and &quot;bulldozing&quot; were being used throughout the United States to describe intimidation &quot;by violent and unlawful means&quot;, which sometimes meant a severe whipping or coercion, or other intimidation, such as at gunpoint. It had a particular meaning in the Southern United States as a whipping or other punishment for African Americans to suppress black voter turnout in the 1876 United States presidential election. 
* 1886: &quot;Bulldozer&quot; meant a large-caliber pistol and the person who wielded it.
* Late 19th century: &quot;Bulldozing&quot; meant using brute force to push over or through any obstacle, with reference to two bulls pushing against each other&#x27;s heads in a fight over dominance.
* 1930s: applied to the vehicle

These appeared as early as 1929, but were known as &quot;bull grader&quot; blades, and the term &quot;bulldozer blade&quot; did not appear to come into widespread use until the mid-1930s. &quot;Bulldozer&quot; now refers to the whole machine, not just the attachment. In contemporary usage, &quot;bulldozer&quot; is sometimes shortened to &quot;dozer&quot;, and the verb &quot;bulldozing&quot; to &quot;dozing&quot;, thus making a homophone with the pre-existing verb &quot;&quot;.

<text>A stunt performer, often called a stuntman or stuntwoman and occasionally stuntperson or stunt-person, is a trained professional who performs daring acts, often as a career. Stunt performers usually appear in films or on television, as opposed to a daredevil, who performs for a live audience. When they take the place of another actor, they are known as stunt doubles.

==Overview==
A stunt performer is an actor skilled in both choreographing and safely presenting actions on-screen that appear to be dangerous, risky, or even deadly. Stunts frequently performed include car crashes, falls from great height, drags (for example, behind a horse), and the consequences of explosions.

There is an inherent risk in the performance of all stunt work. There is maximum risk when the stunts are performed in front of a live audience. In filmed performances, visible safety mechanisms can be removed by editing. In live performances the audience can see more clearly if the performer is genuinely doing what they claim or appear to do. To reduce the risk of injury or death, most often stunts are choreographed or mechanically rigged so that, while they look dangerous, safety mechanisms are built into the performance. Despite their well-choreographed appearance, stunts are still very dangerous and physically testing exercises.

From its inception as a professional skill in the early 1900s to the 1960s, stunts were most often performed by professionals who had trained in that discipline prior to entering the movie industry. Current film and television stunt performers must be trained in a variety of disciplines, including martial arts and stage combat, and must be a certified trained member of a professional stunt performers organisation first in order to obtain the necessary insurance to perform on the stage or screen. This allows them to better break down and plan an action sequence, physically prepare themselves, and incorporate both the safety and risk factors in their performances. However, even when executed perfectly, there is still strain and performing stunts often results in unplanned injury to the body.

Daredevils are distinct from stunt performers and stunt doubles; their performance is of the stunt itself, without the context of a film or television show. Daredevils often perform for an audience. Live stunt performers include escape artists, sword swallowers, glass walkers, fire eaters, trapeze artists, and many other sideshow and circus arts. They also include motorcycle display teams and the once popular Wall of Death. The &quot;Jackass&quot; films and television series are well-known and prominent recorded examples of the act in modern cinematography.

Some people act as both stunt performers and daredevils at various parts of their careers. Examples include Buster Keaton and Harry Houdini; Hong Kong action film stars Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, Michelle Yeoh and Moon Lee; Indian film actors Jayan, Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff and Pawan Kalyan; Thai actor Tony Jaa; and Indonesian film actor Iko Uwais.

==History==

===Cascadeur===

The earliest stunt performers were travelling entertainers and circus performers, particularly trained gymnasts and acrobats. The origin of the original name, the French word &quot;cascadeur&quot;, derivates from &quot;cascade&quot; which is an archaic French term for &quot;fall&quot; (from French cascade, from Italian cascata, from cascare “to fall”).

Later, in the German and Dutch circus use of the word &quot;Kaskadeur&quot;, it meant performing a sequential series of daring leaps and jumps without injury to the performer. This acrobatic discipline required long training in the ring and perfect body control to present a sensational performance to the public.

The word &quot;stunt&quot; was more formally adopted during the 19th-century travelling vaudeville performances of the early Wild West shows, in North America and Europe. The first and prototypical Wild West show was Buffalo Bill&#x27;s, formed in 1883 and lasting until 1913. The shows, which involved simulated battles with the associated firing of both guns and arrows, were a romanticized version of the American Old West.

===Stage combat===

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, stage combat scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the Commonwealth of Nations and North America were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as &quot;standard combats&quot;. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fencing masters in Europe began to research and experiment with historical fencing techniques, with weapons such as the two-handed sword, rapier, and smallsword, and to instruct actors in their use.

Notable among these revivalist instructors were George Dubois, a fight director and martial artist from Paris who created performance fencing styles based on gladiatorial combat as well as Renaissance rapier and dagger fencing. Egerton Castle and Captain Alfred Hutton were part of a wider Victorian era group based in London, involved in reviving historical fencing systems. Circa 1899–1902, Hutton taught stage fencing classes for actors via the Bartitsu Club, where he also served on the Board of Directors and learned the basics of jujutsu and the Vigny method of stick fighting from his fellow instructors.

===Early cinema===

By the early 1900s, the motion picture industry was starting to fire-up on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, but had no need for professional stunt performers. First, motion pictures were so new that even if the producer had a budget for performers, there were more than enough applicants willing to do the scene for free. For instance, if you needed a shot of someone on a steel beam up on a New York skyscraper, then there was always some willing to do the scene for real, and often for free. Second, the Spanish–American War had just ended, and there were many young men who were physically fit and trained in the handling of firearms looking for some work. Thirdly, the former wild west was now not only tamed, but also starting to be fenced in, greatly reducing the need for and pay of the former cowboys.

The first picture which used a dedicated stunt performer is highly debated, but occurred somewhere between 1903 and 1910. The first possible appearance of a stunt-double was Frank Hanaway in &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, shot in 1903 in Milltown, New Jersey. The first auditable paid stunt was in the 1908 film &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, with $5 paid by the director to the acrobat who had to jump upside down from a cliff into the sea.

Professional daredevil, Rodman Law, was a trick parachutist known to thousands for climbing the side of buildings and parachuting out aeroplanes and off of tall base objects like the Statue of Liberty. Some of his stunts were filmed by newsreel cameras and media still photographers. Law was brought into movies in 1912 to perform some of his stunts as the hero.

As the industry developed in the West Coast around Hollywood, California, the first accepted professional stuntmen were clowns and comedians like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and the Keystone Cops. The reason for this was that staple diet of the early films was an almost continual roll call of pratfalls, high dives and comedy car wrecks – the basic ingredients of a circus clown&#x27;s routine. But much like their circus-based predecessors, these actors/stuntmen were not specifically trained to perform stunts, but instead learned through trial and error.

===Cowboy professionals===
From 1910 onwards, American audiences developed a taste for action films, which were replicated into successful serials. These mostly western-themed scripts required a lot of extras, such as for a galloping cavalry, a band of Indians or a fast-riding sheriff&#x27;s posse; all of whom needed to proficiently ride, shoot and look right on camera.

Producers also kept pushing the directors calling for riskier stunts using a recurring cast, necessitating the use of dedicated stunt doubles for most movie stars. The directors turned to the current rodeo stars for inspiration for their action scenes, and employed former cowboys as extras who not only brought with themselves the right look and style, but also rodeo techniques that included safe and replicable horse falls.

Early recruits included Tom Mix, who after winning the 1909 National Riding and Rodeo Championship, worked for the Selig Polyscope Company in Edendale. Mix made his first appearance in &quot;The Cowboy Millionaire&quot; in October 1909, and then as himself in the short documentary film titled &quot;Ranch Life in the Great Southwest&quot; in which he displayed his skills as a cattle wrangler. Mix eventually performed in over 160 cowboy matinee movies during the 1920s, and is considered by many as the first matinee cowboy idol.

The recruitment venture was aided in 1911 by the collapse of the Miller-Arlington rodeo show, which left many rodeo performers stranded in Venice, California. One of them was the young Rose August Wenger, who married and was later billed as Helen Gibson, recognised as the first American professional stunt woman. Thomas H. Ince, who was producing for the New York Motion Picture Company, hired the entire show&#x27;s cast for the winter at $2,500 a week. The performers were paid $8 a week and boarded in Venice, where the horses were stabled. They then rode the each day to work in Topanga Canyon, where the films were being shot. In 1912, Helen made $15 a week for her first billed role as Ruth Roland&#x27;s sister in &quot;Ranch Girls on a Rampage&quot;. After marrying Edmund Richard &quot;Hoot&quot; Gibson in June 1913, the couple continued working rodeos in the summer and as stunt doubles in the winter in California, most often for Kalem Studios in Glendale, California. In April 1915 while on the Kalem payroll doubling for Helen Holmes in &quot;The Hazards of Helen&quot; adventure film series, Helen performed what is thought to be her most dangerous stunt: a leap from the roof of a station onto the top of a moving train in the &quot;A Girl’s Grit&quot; episode. The distance between station roof and train top was accurately measured, and she practiced the jump with the train standing still. In the actual shoot, with the train&#x27;s accelerating velocity timed to the second, she leapt without hesitation and landed correctly, but with forward motion she rolled forward, saving herself from injury and improving the shot by catching hold of an air vent and dangling over the edge. She suffered only a few bruises.

Eventually, the out of work cowboys and out of season rodeo riders, and the directors/producers, figured out a system for the supply of extras. A speakeasy called &quot;The Watering Hole&quot; was located close to a Los Angeles located corral called the Sunset Corral. Every morning, the cowboys would congregate at &quot;The Watering Hole&quot;, where the directors would send over their assistants to hire for the following day. The cowboys would then dress in their normal riding clothes (unless told otherwise, for which they were paid extra), and ride to the set, most of which were located to the north in the vicinity of the San Fernando Valley. These &quot;riding extras&quot; jobs paid $10 per day plus a box lunch, and most were only hired on a per day basis. These early cowboy actors eventually gained the nickname &quot;The Gower Gulch Gang&quot;, as many of the small studios cranking out westerns were located on Gower Avenue.

Subsequently, a number of rodeo stars entered the movie industry on a full-time basis, with many &quot;riding extras&quot; eventually becoming movie stars themselves, including: Hank Bell (300 films, between 1920 and 1952); Bill Gillis; Buck Jones; Jack Montgomery (initially worked as Tom Mix&#x27;s body-double); and Jack Padjeon (first appeared in 1923, played Wild Bill Hickok in the John Ford directed &quot;The Iron Horse&quot; in 1924). But the best known stuntman turned star was probably Yakima Canutt, who with his apprentices who included John Wayne devised during the 1930s new safety devices, including: the &#x27;L&#x27; stirrup which allowed a rider to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup; and cabling equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team. A focus on replicable and safe stunts saved producers money and prevented lost down-time for directors through reduced accidents and injury to performers. Stuntmen were now an integral part of a film&#x27;s drawing power, helping to fill cinemas with thrill seeking patrons anxious to see the new Saturday matinee.

===&quot;Safety Last!&quot;===

Producer/actor Harold Lloyd&#x27;s film &quot;Safety Last!&quot; of 1923, is often considered one of the first to deploy thought-through safety devices and pre-planning in the execution of its filming and stunts. In the script, Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;country boy&quot; character goes to the city to be a success, and ends up climbing a tall building as a stunt. Critics at the time claimed it to be the most spectacular daredevil thrill comedy.

The entire stunt sequence was shot on location at the Atlantic Hotel on the Broadway in Los Angeles (demolished 1957), at actual heights. But the films directors Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor planned into two safety features:
*Mattresses occupied hidden platforms under each performer, who also was wearing a heavily padded corset under their clothing.
*Each performer was attached via a safety harness to a secure safety wire, attached to the building.
Producer Hal Roach and Lloyd had been forced into the costs of planning and construction of these safety devices, as simply without them the city commissioners had refused the production a film permit. Lloyd, ever curious, decided after filming had completed to use a life-size cotton-filled dummy to see what the effect of an accident would have been should they have needed to use the required safety devices. On seeing the results, he didn&#x27;t film another production without them.

In 1983 in his personal homage to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd called &quot;Project A&quot;, Jackie Chan repeats some of the most famous scenes from the early film era, including Lloyd&#x27;s clock scene from &quot;Safety Last!&quot; While Lloyd only hanged from the tower, Chan took it a step further and actually fell from the tower.

===Swashbuckler films===

Swashbuckler films were a unique genre of action movies, utilising the earlier developed art of cinematic fencing, a combination of stage combat and fencing. The most famous of these were the films of Douglas Fairbanks, which defined the genre. The stories came from romantic costume novels, particularly those of Alexandre Dumas and Rafael Sabatini, and included triumphant, thrilling music. There were three great cycles of swashbuckler films: the Douglas Fairbanks period from 1920 to 1929; the Errol Flynn period from 1935 to 1941; and a period in the 1950s heralded by films, including &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; (1953), and the popularity of the British television series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1955–1959).

===Action movies===
The preference to employ ready existing professionals from outside the film industry, either as performers or doubles, continued in the period both up to and beyond World War II, when again the industry was awash with young, fit men looking for work. However, in 1958 &quot;Thunder Road&quot; starring Robert Mitchum, with stunt coordinator Carey Loftin and a stunt team including Ray Austin, Neil Castes Sr., Robert Hoy, and Dale Van Sickel, introduced the era of the car chase movie. With the later development of modern action movie, the accident rate of both stunt performers and movie stars started to quickly increase. The stunt performers took action to professionalise their industry, with the creation of new stunt performer run registration, training, certification, and booking agencies.

In the 1960s, modern stunt technology was developed, including air rams, air bags, and bullet squibs. Dar Robinson invented the decelerator during this period, which used dragline cables rather than airbags for stunts that called for a jump from high places. The co-development of this technology and professional performance training continues to evolve to the present, brought about through the need to not only create more visual impact on screen in the modern action movie era. It also provides a safe platform to a new breed of trained professional stunt performers, including Bill Hickman, Terry Richards, and motorcycle greats Bud Ekins and Evel Knievel. These new professionals were not only driven to create visual impact, but also perform seemingly impossible feats in a safe and repeatable manner. Latterly came the fast action Martial arts movies as a distinct genre, originating for western consumption mainly from Hong Kong from the 1940s, choreographed and later acted in by stunt performers turned stars including Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba from the 1960s, Kent Norman &quot;Superkentman&quot; Elofson, and latterly Jackie Chan.

===Hong Kong action cinema===
In 1982, Jackie Chan began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences in &quot;Dragon Lord&quot;, which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes required for a single scene, with 2900 takes, and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground. In 1983, &quot;Project A&quot; saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and typical slapstick humor (at one point, Chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies).

&quot;Police Story&quot; (1985) contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a car chase through a shanty town, Chan stopping a double-decker bus with his service revolver and a climactic fight scene in a shopping center. This final scene earned the film the nickname &quot;Glass Story&quot; by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of sugar glass that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene, in which Chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in Chan suffering second-degree burns, particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing. Chan performed similarly elaborate stunts in numerous other films, such as several &quot;Police Story&quot; sequels, &quot;Project A Part II&quot;, the &quot;Armor of God&quot; series, &quot;Dragons Forever&quot;, &quot;Drunken Master II&quot; and &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; among others.

Other Hong Kong action movie stars who became known for performing elaborate stunts include Chan&#x27;s Peking Opera School friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, as well as &quot;girls with guns&quot; stars such as Michelle Yeoh and Moon Lee. Other Asian cinema stars also known for performing elaborate stunts include Thai actor Tony Jaa; Indonesian actors Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian; and Indian actors Jayan, Ajith Kumar, Akshay Kumar, Puneeth Rajkumar, Vidyut Jammwal and Tiger Shroff.

==Awards==
There is no Oscar category for stunt performance, but in 1967, Yakima Canutt was awarded an Academy Honorary Award for his stunt career. Hal Needham joined him in 2012, while Jackie Chan was awarded one in 2016 with his &quot;inventive stunt work&quot; being cited. The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awards an Emmy for stunt coordinators.

The Taurus World Stunt Awards gives stunt people their own annual awards, but also through its foundation offers financial support to stunt men around the world who have been injured while on the job.

==Deaths==
Although the stories that stuntmen died while filming &quot;Ben Hur&quot; and &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; are apocryphal, life-threatening injuries and deaths do occur. Contracts often stipulate that the footage may be used if the performer is injured or dies during filming, and some filmmakers such as Jackie Chan consider it disrespectful not to do so.

A University of Illinois study from the 1980s lists accidents and fatalities from films during that era, concluding that it seemed probable that the tendency of film audiences to be interested in ever more dangerous film stunts would likely see increasing fatality rates.

<text>The Swiss Army knife (SAK; ) is a pocketknife, generally multi-tooled, now manufactured by Victorinox. The term &quot;Swiss Army knife&quot; was coined by American soldiers after World War II because they had trouble pronouncing the German word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;officer’s knife&quot;.

The Swiss Army knife generally has a drop-point main blade plus other types of blades and tools, such as a screwdriver, a can opener, a saw blade, a pair of scissors, and many others. These are folded into the handle of the knife through a pivot point mechanism. The handle is traditionally a red colour, with either a Victorinox or Wenger &quot;cross&quot; logo or, for Swiss military issue knives, the coat of arms of Switzerland. Other colours, textures, and shapes have appeared over the years.

Originating in Ibach, Switzerland, the Swiss Army knife was first produced in 1891 when the Karl Elsener company, which later became Victorinox, won the contract to produce the Swiss Army&#x27;s &quot;Modell 1890&quot; knife from the previous German manufacturer. In 1893, the Swiss cutlery company Paul Boéchat &amp; Cie, which later became Wenger SA, received its first contract from the Swiss military to produce model 1890 knives; the two companies split the initial contract for provision of the knives and operated as separate enterprises from 1908. In 2005 Victorinox acquired Wenger. As an icon of the culture of Switzerland, both the design and the versatility of the knife have worldwide recognition. The term &quot;Swiss Army knife&quot; has acquired usage as a figure of speech indicating a multifaceted skillset.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The Swiss Army Knife was not the first multi-use pocket knife. In 1851, in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (chapter 107), Herman Melville mentions the &quot;Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior – though a little swelled – of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screwdrivers, cork-screws, tweezers, bradawls, pens, rulers, nail files and countersinkers.&quot;

During the late 1880s, the Swiss Army decided to purchase a new folding pocket knife for their soldiers. This knife was to be suitable for use by the army in opening canned food and for maintenance of the Swiss service rifle, the Schmidt–Rubin, which required a screwdriver for assembly and disassembly.

In January 1891, the knife received the official designation &quot;Modell 1890&quot;. The knife had a blade, reamer, can opener, screwdriver, and grips made out of dark oak wood that some say was later partly replaced with ebony wood. At that time no Swiss company had the necessary production capacity, so the initial order for 15,000 knives was placed with the German knife manufacturer Wester &amp; Co. from Solingen, Germany. These knives were delivered in October 1891.

In 1891, Karl Elsener, then owner of a company that made surgical equipment, set out to manufacture the knives in Switzerland itself. At the end of 1891 Elsener began production of the &quot;Modell 1890&quot; knives, in direct competition with the Solingen company. He incurred financial losses doing so, as Wester &amp; Co was able to produce the knives at a lower cost. Elsener was on the verge of bankruptcy when, in 1896, he developed an improved knife, intended for the use by officers, with tools attached on both sides of the handle using a special spring mechanism, allowing him to use the same spring to hold them in place. This new knife was patented on 12 June 1897, with a second, smaller cutting blade, a corkscrew, and wood fibre grips, under the name of &quot;Schweizer Offiziers- und Sportmesser&quot; (&quot;Swiss officer&#x27;s and sports knife&quot;). While the Swiss military did not commission the knife, it was successfully marketed internationally, restoring Elsener&#x27;s company to prosperity.

Elsener used a variation on the Swiss coat of arms to identify his knives beginning in 1909. With slight modifications, this is still the company logo. Also in 1909, on the death of his mother, Elsener used his mother&#x27;s name &quot;Victoria&quot;, as a brand name, in her honour. In 1921 following the invention of stainless steel ( in French), Karl Elsener&#x27;s son renamed the company to be Victorinox combining &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;inoxydable&quot;.

In 1893 the second industrial cutler of Switzerland, &quot;Paul Boéchat &amp; Cie&quot;, headquartered in Delémont in the French-speaking region of Jura, started selling a similar product. Its general manager, Théodore Wenger, acquired the company and renamed it the Wenger Company.

=== Victorinox and Wenger ===

In 1908 the Swiss government split the contract between Victorinox and Wenger, placing half the orders with each.
By mutual agreement, Wenger advertised &quot;the Genuine Swiss Army Knife&quot; and Victorinox used the slogan, &quot;the Original Swiss Army Knife&quot;.

On 26 April 2005, Victorinox acquired Wenger, once again becoming the sole supplier of knives to the military of Switzerland. Victorinox at first kept the Wenger brand intact, but on 30 January 2013, the company announced that the Wenger brand of knives would be abandoned in favour of Victorinox.
The press release stated that Wenger&#x27;s factory in Delémont would continue to produce knives and all employees at this site will retain their jobs. They further elaborated that an assortment of items from the Wenger line-up will remain in production under the Victorinox brand name. Wenger&#x27;s US headquarters will be merged with Victorinox&#x27;s location in Monroe, Connecticut. Wenger&#x27;s watch and licensing business will continue as a separate brand: SwissGear.

Up until 2008 Victorinox AG and Wenger SA supplied about 50,000 knives to the military of Switzerland each year, and manufactured many more for export, mostly to the United States. Commercial knives can be distinguished by their cross logos; the Victorinox cross logo is surrounded by a shield while the Wenger cross logo is surrounded by a slightly rounded square.

Victorinox registered the words &quot;Swiss Army&quot; and &quot;Swiss Military&quot; as a trademark in the US and was sued at Bern cantonal commercial court by the Swiss Confederacy (represented by Armasuisse, the authority representing the actual Swiss military), in October 2018. After an initial hearing Victorinox agreed to cede the registration in the United States of the term &quot;Swiss military&quot; to Armasuisse in return for an exclusive licence to market perfumes under the same name.

== Features, tools, and parts ==

=== Tools and components ===


There are various models of the Swiss Army knife with different tool combinations.

Though Victorinox does not provide custom knives, they have produced many different variations to suit individual users, with the Wenger company producing even more model variations. 
&quot;Common main layer tools:&quot;

Three Victorinox SAK models had a butane lighter: the SwissFlame, the CampFlame and the SwissChamp XXLT, first introduced in 2002 and discontinued in 2005. The models were never sold in the United States due to lack of safety features. They used a standard piezoelectric ignition system for easy ignition, with adjustable flame; they and were designed for operation at altitudes up to above sea level and continuous operation of 10 minutes.

In January 2010, Victorinox announced the Presentation Master models, released in April 2010. The technological tools included a laser pointer, and detachable flash drive with fingerprint reader. Victorinox now sells an updated version called the Slim Jetsetter, with &quot;a premium software package that provides ultra secure data encryption, automatic backup functionality, secure web surfing capabilities, file and email synchronization between the drive and multiple computers, Bluetooth pairing and much more. On the hardware side of things, biometric fingerprint technology, laser pointers, LED lights, Bluetooth remote control and of course, the original Swiss Army Knife implements – blade, scissors, nail file, screwdriver, key ring and ballpoint pen are standard. **Not every feature is available on every model within the collection.&quot;

In 2006, Wenger produced a knife called &quot;The Giant&quot; that included every implement the company ever made, with 87 tools and 141 different functions. It was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s most multifunctional penknife. It retails for about €798 or $US1000, though some vendors charge much higher prices.

In the same year, Victorinox released the SwissChamp XAVT, consisting of 118 parts and 80 functions with a retail price of $425. The Guinness Book of Records recognizes a unique 314-blade Swiss Army-style knife made in 1991 by Master Cutler Hans Meister as the world&#x27;s largest penknife, weighing .

=== Locking mechanisms ===
Some Swiss Army knives have locking blades to prevent accidental closure. Wenger was the first to offer a &quot;PackLock&quot; for the main blade on several of their standard 85mm models. Several large Wenger and Victorinox models have a locking blade secured by a slide lock that is operated with an unlocking-button integrated in the scales. Some Victorinox 111 mm series knives have a double liner lock that secures the cutting blade and large slotted screwdriver/cap opener/wire stripper combination tool designed towards prying.

=== Design and materials ===
Rivets and flanged bushings made from brass hold together all machined steel parts and other tools, separators and the scales. The rivets are made by cutting and pointing appropriately sized bars of solid brass.

The separators between the tools have been made from aluminium alloy since 1951. This makes the knives lighter. Previously these separating layers were made of nickel-silver.

The martensitic stainless steel alloy used for the cutting blades is optimized for high toughness and corrosion resistance and has a composition of 15% chromium, 0.60% silicon, 0.52% carbon, 0.50% molybdenum, and 0.45% manganese and is designated X55CrMo14 or DIN 1.4110 according to Victorinox. After a hardening process at 1040 °C and annealing at 160 °C the blades achieve an average hardness of 56 HRC. This steel hardness is suitable for practical use and easy resharpening, but less than achieved in stainless steel alloys used for blades optimized for high wear resistance. According to Victorinox the martensitic stainless steel alloy used for the other parts is X39Cr13 (aka DIN 1.4031, AISI/ASTM 420) and for the springs X20Cr13 (aka DIN 1.4021, but still within AISI/ASTM 420).

The steel used for the wood saws, scissors and nail files has a steel hardness of HRC 53, the screwdrivers, tin openers and awls have a hardness of HRC 52, and the corkscrew and springs have a hardness of HRC 49.

The metal saws and files, in addition to the special case hardening, are also subjected to a hard chromium plating process so that iron and steel can also be filed and cut.

Although red Cellulose Acetate Butyrate (CAB) (generally known trade names are Cellidor, Tenite and Tenex) scaled Swiss Army knives are most common, there are many colors and alternative materials like more resilient nylon and aluminum for the scales available. Many textures, colors and shapes now appear in the Swiss Army Knife. Since 2006 the scales on some knife models can have textured rubber non-slip inlays incorporated, intended for sufficient grip with moist or wet hands. The rubber also provides some impact protection for such edged scales. Modifications have been made, including professionally produced custom models combining novel materials, colors, finishes and occasionally new tools such as firesteels or tool &#x27;blades&#x27; mounting replaceable surgical scalpel blades to replacement of standard scales (handles) with new versions in natural materials such as buffalo horn. In addition to &#x27;limited edition&#x27; productions runs, numerous examples from basic to professional-level customizations of standard knives—such as retrofitting pocket clips, one-off scales created using 3D printing techniques, decoration using anodization and new scale materials—can be found by searching for &quot;SAK mods&quot;.

== Assembly ==
During assembly, all components are placed on several brass rivets. The first components are generally an aluminium separator and a flat steel spring. Once a layer of tools is installed, another separator and spring are placed for the next layer of tools. This process is repeated until all the desired tool layers and the finishing separator are installed. Once the knife is built, the metal parts are fastened by adding brass flanged bushings to the rivets. The excess length of the rivets is then cut off to make them flush with the bushings. Finally, the remaining length of the rivets is flattened into the flanged bushings.

After the assembly of the metal parts, the blades on smaller knives are sharpened to a 15° angle, resulting in a 30° V-shaped steel cutting edge. From sized knives the blades are sharpened to a 20° angle, resulting in a 40° V-shaped steel cutting edge. Chisel ground blades are sharpened to a 24° angle, resulting in a 24° asymmetric-shaped steel cutting edge where only one side is ground and the other is deburred and remains flat. The blades are then checked with a laser reflecting goniometer to verify the angle of the cutting edges.

Finally, scales are applied. Slightly undersized holes incorporated into the inner surface enclose the bushings, which have truncated cone cross-section and are slightly undercut, forming a one-way interference fit when pressed into the generally softer and more elastic scale material. The result is a tight adhesive-free connection that nonetheless permits new identical-pattern scales to be quickly and easily applied.

== Sizes ==
Victorinox models are available in , , , , , , and lengths when closed. The thickness of the knives varies depending on the number of tool layers included. The models offer the most variety in tool configurations in the Victorinox model line with as many as 15 layers.

Wenger models are available in , , , , and lengths when closed. Thickness varies depending on the number of tool layers included. The models offer the most variety in tool configurations in the Wenger model line, with as many as 10 layers.

==Knives issued by the Swiss Armed Forces ==

Since the first issue as personal equipment in 1891 the &quot;Soldatenmesser&quot; (Soldier Knives) issued by the Swiss Armed Forces have been revised several times. There are five different main &quot;Modelle&quot; (models). Their model numbers refer to the year of introduction in the military supply chain. Several main models have been revised over time and therefore exist in different &quot;Ausführungen&quot; (executions), also denoted by the year of introduction. The issued models of the Swiss Armed Forces are:
* Modell 1890
** Modell 1890 Ausführung 1901
* Modell 1908
* Modell 1951
** Modell 1951 Ausführung 1954
** Modell 1951 Ausführung 1957
* Modell 1961
** Modell 1961 Ausführung 1965
** Modell 1961 Ausführung 1978
** Modell 1961 Ausführung 1994
* Soldatenmesser 08 (Soldier Knife 08)

Soldier Knives are issued to every recruit or member of the Swiss Armed Forces and the knives issued to officers have never differed from those issued to non-commissioned officers and privates. A model incorporating a corkscrew and scissors was produced as an officer&#x27;s tool, but was deemed not &quot;essential for survival&quot;. Officers were free to purchase it individually on their own account.

=== Soldier knife model 1890 ===
The Soldier Knife model 1890 had a spear point blade, reamer, can-opener, screwdriver and grips made out of oak wood scales (handles) that were treated with rapeseed oil for greater toughness and water-repellency, which made them black in color. The wooden grips of the Modell 1890 tended to crack and chip so in 1901 these were changed to a hard reddish-brown fiber similar in appearance to wood. The knife was long, thick and weighed .

=== Soldier knife model 1908 ===
The Soldier Knife model 1908 had a clip point blade rather than the 1890s spear point blade, still with the fiber scales, carbon steel tools, nickel-silver bolster, liners, and divider. The knife was long, thick and weighed . The contract with the Swiss Army split production equally between the Victorinox and Wenger companies.

=== Soldier knife model 1951 ===
The soldier Knife model 1951 had fiber scales, nickel-silver bolsters, liners, and divider, and a spear point blade. This was the first Swiss Armed Forces issue model where the tools were made of stainless steel. The screwdriver now had a scraper arc on one edge. The knife was long, thick and weighed .

=== Soldier knife model 1961 ===
The Soldier Knife model 1961 has a long knurled alox handle with the Swiss crest, a drop point blade, a reamer, a blade combining bottle opener, screwdriver, and wire stripper, and a combined can-opener and small screwdriver. The knife was thick and weighed 

The 1961 model also contains a brass spacer, which allows the knife, with the screwdriver and the reamer extended simultaneously, to be used to assemble the SIG 550 and SIG 510 assault rifles: the knife serves as a restraint to the firing pin during assembly of the lock. The Soldier Knife model 1961 was manufactured only by Victorinox and Wenger and was the first issued knife bearing the Swiss Coat of Arms on the handle.

=== Soldier knife 08 ===
In 2007 the Swiss Government made a request for new updated soldier knives for the Swiss military for distribution in late 2008. The evaluation phase of the new soldier knife began in February 2008, when Armasuisse issued an invitation to tender. A total of seven suppliers from Switzerland and other countries were invited to participate in the evaluation process. Functional models submitted by suppliers underwent practical testing by military personnel in July 2008, while laboratory tests were used to assess compliance with technical requirements. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted and the model with the best price/performance ratio was awarded the contract. The order for 75,000 soldier knives plus cases was worth . This equates to a purchase price of , , in October 2009 per knife plus case.

Victorinox won the contest with a knife based on the One-Hand German Army Knife as issued by the German &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; and released in the civilian model lineup with the addition of a toothpick and tweezers stored in the nylon grip scales (side cover plates) as the One-Hand Trekker/Trailmaster model. Mass production of the new &quot;Soldatenmesser 08&quot; (Soldier Knife 08) for the Swiss Armed Forces was started in December 2008, and first issued to the Swiss Armed Forces beginning with the first basic training sessions of 2009.

The Soldier Knife 08 has an long ergonomic dual density handle with TPU rubbery thermoplastic elastomer non-slip inlays incorporated in the green Polyamide 6 grip shells and a double liner locking system, one-hand long locking partly wavy serrated chisel ground (optimized for right-handed use) drop point blade sharpened to a 24° angle, wood saw, can opener with small slotted screwdriver, locking bottle opener with large slotted screwdriver and wire stripper/bender, reamer sharpened to a 48° angle, Phillips (PH2) screwdriver and diameter split keyring. The Soldier Knife 08 width is , thickness is , overall length opened is and it weighs . The Soldier Knife 08 was not manufactured by Wenger.

== Knives issued by other militaries ==
The armed forces of more than 20 different nations have issued or approved the use of various versions of Swiss army knives made by Victorinox, among them the forces of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Malaysia and the United States (NSN 1095-01-653-1166 Knife, Combat).

== Space program ==
The Swiss Army knife has been present in space missions carried out by NASA since the late 1970s. In 1978, NASA sent a letter of confirmation to Victorinox regarding a purchase of 50 knives known as the Master Craftsman model. In 1985, Edward M. Payton, brother of astronaut Gary E. Payton, sent a letter to Victorinox, asking about getting a Master Craftsman knife after seeing the one his brother used in space. There are other stories of repairs conducted in space using a Swiss Army knife.

== Cultural impact ==
The Swiss Army knife has been added to the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Munich&#x27;s State Museum of Applied Art for its design. The term &quot;Swiss Army&quot; currently is a registered trademark owned by Victorinox AG and its subsidiary, Wenger SA.

In both the original television series &quot;MacGyver&quot; as well as its 2016 reboot, character Angus MacGyver frequently uses different Swiss Army knives in various episodes to solve problems and construct simple objects.

The term &quot;Swiss Army knife&quot; has entered popular culture as a metaphor for usefulness and adaptability. The multi-purpose nature of the tool has also inspired a number of other gadgets.

A particularly large Wenger knife model, Wenger 16999, has inspired a large number of humorous reviews on Amazon. This model was recognized by Guinness World Records as &#x27;The World&#x27;s Most Multifunctional Penknife&#x27;.

When U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California Roger Benitez overturned California&#x27;s 30-year-old ban on assault weapons in &quot;Miller v. Bonta&quot;, he compared the Swiss Army knife to the AR-15 rifle in the first sentence of his opinion, &quot;Like the Swiss Army Knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment.&quot; In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that the comparison &quot;completely undermines the credibility of this decision&quot;.

<text>Louis Charles Augustin Georges Trenet (; 18 May 1913 – 19 February 2001) was a renowned French singer-songwriter who composed both the music and the lyrics for nearly 1,000 songs over a career that lasted more than 60 years. These songs include &quot;&quot;Boum!&quot; (1938), &quot;La Mer&quot; (1946) and &quot;Nationale 7&quot; (1955). Trenet is also noted for his work with musicians Michel Emer and Léo Chauliac, with whom he recorded &quot;Y&#x27;a d&#x27;la joie&quot; (1938) for the first and &quot;La Romance de Paris&quot; (1941) and &quot;Douce France&quot;&quot; (1947) for the latter. He was awarded an Honorary Molière Award in 2000.

== History ==

Trenet&#x27;s best-known songs include &quot;Boum!&quot;, &quot;&quot;La Mer&quot;, &quot;Y&#x27;a d&#x27;la joie&quot;, &quot;Que reste-t-il de nos amours?&quot;, &quot;Ménilmontant&quot; and &quot;Douce France&quot;. His catalogue of songs is enormous, numbering close to 1,000.

Some of his songs had unconventional subject matter, with whimsical imagery bordering on the surreal. &quot;Y&#x27;a d&#x27;la joie&quot; evokes joy through a series of disconnected images, including that of a subway car shooting out of its tunnel into the air, the Eiffel Tower crossing the street, and a baker making excellent bread. The lovers engaged in a minuet in &quot;Polka du Roi&quot;&quot; reveal themselves at length to be &quot;no longer human&quot;: they are made of wax and trapped in the Musée Grévin. Many of his hits from the 1930s and 1940s effectively combine the melodic and verbal nuances of French song with American swing rhythms.

His song &quot;&quot;La Mer&quot;, which according to legend he composed with Léo Chauliac on a train in 1943, was recorded in 1946. Trenet explained in an interview that he was told that &quot;La Mer&quot;&quot; was not swing enough to be a hit, and for this reason, it sat in a drawer for three years before it was recorded.

&quot;La Mer&quot; is Trenet&#x27;s best-known work outside the French-speaking world, with more than 400 recorded versions. The tune, given unrelated English words and the title &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; (or sometimes &quot;Sailing&quot;), was a hit for Bobby Darin in the early 1960s, and George Benson in the mid-1980s. &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; was used in the ending credits of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.

Besides &quot;&quot;La Mer&quot;, the other Trenet song to receive numerous recordings in English is &quot;Que reste-t-il de nos amours?&quot;&quot;, which lyricist Albert Beach adapted as &quot;I Wish You Love&quot;. &quot;I Wish You Love&quot; was first recorded by Keely Smith in 1957, and since then, by artists that include Frank Sinatra, Blossom Dearie, Sam Cooke, and Dusty Springfield.

&quot;&quot;Formidable&quot;, another of Trenet&#x27;s songs, was written as impressions of a trip to the U.S. Other Trenet songs were recorded by French singers such as Maurice Chevalier, Jean Sablon and Fréhel.

==Early life==

Trenet was born in Avenue Charles Trenet, Narbonne, Occitanie, France, the son of Françoise Louise Constance (Caussat) and Lucien Etienne Paul Trenet. When he was age 7, his parents divorced, and he was sent to boarding school in Béziers, but he returned home just a few months later, suffering from typhoid fever. It was during his convalescence at home that he developed his artistic talents, such as performing music, painting and sculpting. His mother remarried, and he lived with her and his stepfather, the writer Benno Vigny.

In 1922, Trenet moved to Perpignan, this time as a day pupil. André Fons-Godail, the &quot;Catalan Renoir&quot; and a friend of the family, took him for excursions with painting. His poetry is said to have the painter&#x27;s eye for detail and colour. Many of his songs refer to his surroundings such as places near Narbonne, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean coast.

He passed his &quot;baccalauréat&quot; with high marks in 1927. After leaving school, he left for Berlin, where he studied art, and later, he also briefly studied at art schools in France. When Trenet first arrived in Paris in the 1930s, he worked in a movie studio as a props handler and assistant, and later joined the artists in the Montparnasse neighbourhood. His admiration of the surrealist poet and Catholic mystic Max Jacob (1876–1944) and his love of jazz were two factors that influenced Trenet&#x27;s songs.

==Before World War II==
From 1933 to 1936, he worked with the Swiss pianist Johnny Hess as a duo known as Charles and Johnny. They performed at various Parisian venues, such as Le Fiacre, La Villa d&#x27;Este, the Européen and the Alhambra. They recorded 18 discs for Pathé, the most successful of which was &quot;Quand les beaux jours seront là/Sur le Yang-Tsé-Kiang&quot;. The Charles and Johnny records feature Hess on piano, with the two frequently singing in two-part harmonies with quickly alternating solo spots for the two. Around 1935, the duo appeared regularly on the radio on a broadcast titled &quot;Quart d&#x27;heure des enfants terribles&quot;.

The duo continued until 1936 when Trenet was called up for national service. After performing this, he received the nickname that he would retain all his life: &quot;Le Fou chantant&quot; (The Singing Madman). He began his solo career in 1937, recording for Columbia, his first disc being &quot;Je chante/Fleur bleue&quot;. The exuberant &quot;Je chante&quot; gave rise to the notion of Trenet as a &quot;singing vagabond&quot;, a theme that appeared in a number of his early songs and films. He shot to stardom very quickly; as Jean Cocteau put it, when Trenet sang, &quot;He was so young, so fresh that the bar yielded to a rustic decor, the projectors became the stiff branches of a cherry tree, the microphone a hollyhock, the piano a cow.&quot;

==World War II==
At the start of World War II, Trenet was called up. He was in barracks at Salon-de-Provence until he was demobilized in June 1940, when he moved back to Paris. There he performed at the Folies Bergère or at the Gaîté Parisienne (two famous cabarets) in front of a public often consisting of German officers and soldiers. The collaborationist press tried to compromise him by claiming that &quot;Trenet&quot; was an anagram of his real, supposedly Jewish name, &quot;Netter&quot;. However, Trenet was able to show his family tree to the authorities, thus proving that he was not Jewish at all.

Like many other artistes of the time, he chose to entertain the occupying forces rather than sacrifice his career. He agreed, when asked by the Germans, to sing for French prisoners of war in Germany.

During the &quot;Épuration légale&quot; (&quot;legal purge&quot;), the wave of official trials that followed the Liberation of France and the fall of the Vichy Regime, a court examined whether Trenet was guilty of collaboration. The inquiry resulted in a reprimand, without any other consequences.

==After World War II==
After the end of hostilities, he moved to the United States where he lived for a few years and where he quickly became a success. After a few concerts at the Bagdad in New York City, Trenet became a big hit and was approached by Hollywood. He met Louis Armstrong and began a long-lasting friendship with Charlie Chaplin.

On 14 September 1951, Trenet returned to Paris and made a comeback at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Étoile. He incorporated 10 new songs into his act, including &quot;De la fenêtre d&#x27;en haut&quot; and &quot;La Folle Complainte&quot;. In 1954, he performed at the Olympia music-hall in Paris for the first time. The following year, he wrote the famous &quot;Route nationale 7&quot;, a tribute to the introduction of paid holidays.

In 1958, Trenet was the headlining act at the Bobino and the Alhambra. In 1960, he returned to the Théâtre de l&#x27;Étoile, appearing on stage for the first time without the famous trilby hat that long had been part of his act.

In 1963, Trenet spent 28 days in prison in Aix-en-Provence. He was charged with corrupting the morals of four young men under the age of 21 (they were 19). His chauffeur claimed that Trenet was using him as a pimp. The charges eventually were dropped, but the affair brought to public light the fact that Trenet was homosexual. He was never particularly public about the episode and spoke of it rarely. In his authorized biography of Maurice Chevalier, author David Bret claims that Chevalier and Mistinguett were the ones who first &quot;shopped&quot; Trenet to the police for consorting with underage boys, around 1940. Trenet never learned of their actions.

==1970s==

In 1970, Trenet flew to Japan to represent France at the Universal Exhibition in Osaka. The following year, he left Columbia, his longtime record label, and recorded &quot;Fidèle&quot; and &quot;Il y avait des arbres.&quot; He also made a memorable appearance at the Olympia.

In 1973, Trenet, who had just celebrated his 60th birthday, recorded the album, &quot;Chansons en liberté&quot;. The 12 songs on this album were a mix of old and new compositions. His 60th birthday was celebrated in grand style by the French media.

Trenet made a surprise announcement in 1975, declaring that he was retiring from the music world. At the end of his final concert at the Olympia, he bade his audience an emotional farewell. Following the death of his mother in 1979, he shut himself away from the world for the next two years.

==Later career and death==
Nevertheless, in 1981, Trenet made a comeback with an album devoted to sentimental memories of his childhood. Trenet then returned to his peaceful semi-retirement in Occitanie, occasionally reappearing for a special gala performance in France or abroad. After giving farewell concerts in France, Trenet was persuaded out of retirement by French-Canadian lawyer Gilbert Rozon in 1983 for a farewell concert in Montreal. Rozon became Trenet&#x27;s manager thereafter, and as a result, Trenet performed many more concerts, including a series every night for three weeks at the Palais des Congrès in Paris in 1986.

On 21 May 1999, he returned to the music scene with his album &quot;Les poètes descendent dans la rue&quot; (&quot;Poets Take to the Streets&quot;). Following the release of the album, Trenet returned to the live circuit.

In April 2000, Trenet was rushed to hospital after suffering a stroke. The singer was forced to spend several weeks in the hospital while recovering. By the autumn of that year, he was well enough to attend the dress rehearsal of Charles Aznavour&#x27;s show at the Palais des Congrès on 25 October. It was his final public appearance.

In November 2000, the Narbonne house in which Trenet was born – which had become 13 Avenue Charles Trenet – was turned into a small museum. Visitors were able to view souvenirs from Trenet&#x27;s childhood and family life (especially those belonging to his mother, who had spent most of her life in the house) as well as original drafts of the songs that made his career.

Trenet died three months later on 19 February 2001 after suffering another stroke.

In 2017, a service centre on the A9 autoroute between Narbonne and Béziers was renamed in his honour. It contains an exhibition evoking his life and work, and sculptures by Pascale and Thierry Delorme.

<doc id="313845" wikidata="Q1437394" url="?curid=313845" title="Formal concept analysis">
<text>In information science, formal concept analysis (FCA) is a principled way of deriving a &quot;concept hierarchy&quot; or formal ontology from a collection of objects and their properties. Each concept in the hierarchy represents the objects sharing some set of properties; and each sub-concept in the hierarchy represents a subset of the objects (as well as a superset of the properties) in the concepts above it. The term was introduced by Rudolf Wille in 1981, and builds on the mathematical theory of lattices and ordered sets that was developed by Garrett Birkhoff and others in the 1930s.

Formal concept analysis finds practical application in fields including data mining, text mining, machine learning, knowledge management, semantic web, software development, chemistry and biology.

== Overview and history ==
The original motivation of formal concept analysis was the search for real-world meaning of mathematical order theory. One such possibility of very general nature is that data tables can be transformed into algebraic structures called &quot;complete lattices&quot;, and that these can be utilized for data visualization and interpretation. A data table that represents a heterogeneous relation between objects and attributes, tabulating pairs of the form &quot;object &quot;g&quot; has attribute &quot;m&quot;&quot;, is considered as a basic data type. It is referred to as a &quot;formal context&quot;. In this theory, a &quot;formal concept&quot; is defined to be a pair (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), where &quot;A&quot; is a set of objects (called the &quot;extent&quot;) and &quot;B&quot; is a set of attributes (the &quot;intent&quot;) such that

* the extent &quot;A&quot; consists of all objects that share the attributes in &quot;B&quot;, and dually
* the intent &quot;B&quot; consists of all attributes shared by the objects in &quot;A&quot;.

In this way, formal concept analysis formalizes the semantic notions of extension and intension.

The formal concepts of any formal context can—as explained below—be ordered in a hierarchy called more formally the context&#x27;s &quot;concept lattice&quot;. The concept lattice can be graphically visualized as a &quot;line diagram&quot;, which then may be helpful for understanding the data. Often however these lattices get too large for visualization. Then the mathematical theory of formal concept analysis may be helpful, e.g., for decomposing the lattice into smaller pieces without information loss, or for embedding it into another structure which is easier to interpret.

The theory in its present form goes back to the early 1980s and a research group led by Rudolf Wille, Bernhard Ganter and Peter Burmeister at the Technische Universität Darmstadt. Its basic mathematical definitions, however, were already introduced in the 1930s by Garrett Birkhoff as part of general lattice theory. Other previous approaches to the same idea arose from various French research groups, but the Darmstadt group normalised the field and systematically worked out both its mathematical theory and its philosophical foundations. The latter refer in particular to Charles S. Peirce, but also to the &quot;Port-Royal Logic&quot;.

== Motivation and philosophical background ==
In his article &quot;Restructuring Lattice Theory&quot; (1982), initiating formal concept analysis as a mathematical discipline, Wille starts from a discontent with the current lattice theory and pure mathematics in general: The production of theoretical results—often achieved by &quot;elaborate mental gymnastics&quot;—were impressive, but the connections between neighboring domains, even parts of a theory were getting weaker.

This aim traces back to the educationalist Hartmut von Hentig, who in 1972 pleaded for restructuring sciences in view of better teaching and in order to make sciences mutually available and more generally (i.e. also without specialized knowledge) critiqueable. Hence, by its origins formal concept analysis aims at interdisciplinarity and democratic control of research.

It corrects the starting point of lattice theory during the development of formal logic in the 19th century. Then—and later in model theory—a concept as unary predicate had been reduced to its extent. Now again, the philosophy of concepts should become less abstract by considering the intent. Hence, formal concept analysis is oriented towards the categories extension and intension of linguistics and classical conceptual logic.

Formal concept analysis aims at the clarity of concepts according to Charles S. Peirce&#x27;s pragmatic maxim by unfolding observable, elementary properties of the subsumed objects. In his late philosophy, Peirce assumed that logical thinking aims at perceiving reality, by the triade concept, judgement and conclusion. Mathematics is an abstraction of logic, develops patterns of possible realities and therefore may support rational communication. On this background, Wille defines:

== Example ==

The data in the example is taken from a semantic field study, where different kinds of bodies of water were systematically categorized by their attributes. For the purpose here it has been simplified.

The data table represents a &quot;formal context&quot;, the &quot;line diagram&quot; next to it shows its &quot;concept lattice&quot;. Formal definitions follow below.


The above line diagram consists of circles, connecting line segments, and labels. Circles represent &quot;formal concepts&quot;. The lines allow to read off the subconcept-superconcept hierarchy. Each object and attribute name is used as a label exactly once in the diagram, with objects below and attributes above concept circles. This is done in a way that an attribute can be reached from an object via an ascending path if and only if the object has the attribute.

In the diagram shown, e.g. the object &quot;reservoir&quot; has the attributes &quot;stagnant&quot; and &quot;constant&quot;, but not the attributes &quot;temporary, running, natural, maritime&quot;. Accordingly, &quot;puddle&quot; has exactly the characteristics &quot;temporary, stagnant&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;.

The original formal context can be reconstructed from the labelled diagram, as well as the formal concepts. The extent of a concept consists of those objects from which an ascending path leads to the circle representing the concept. The intent consists of those attributes to which there is an ascending path from that concept circle (in the diagram). In this diagram the concept immediately to the left of the label &quot;reservoir&quot; has the intent &quot;stagnant&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; and the extent &quot;puddle, maar, lake, pond, tarn, pool, lagoon,&quot; and &quot;sea&quot;.

== Formal contexts and concepts ==
A formal context is a triple , where &quot;G&quot; is a set of &quot;objects&quot;, &quot;M&quot; is a set of &quot;attributes&quot;, and is a binary relation called &quot;incidence&quot; that expresses which objects &quot;have&quot; which attributes. For subsets of objects and subsets of attributes, one defines two &quot;derivation operators&quot; as follows:

: , i.e., a set of all attributes shared by all objects from A, and dually

: , i.e., a set of all objects sharing all attributes from B.

Applying either derivation operator and then the other constitutes two closure operators:

:&quot;A&quot; ↦ &#x27; = (&#x27;) for &quot;A&quot; ⊆ G (extent closure), and

:&quot;B&quot; ↦ &#x27; = (&#x27;) for &quot;B&quot; ⊆ M (intent closure).

The derivation operators define a Galois connection between sets of objects and of attributes. This is why in French a concept lattice is sometimes called a &quot;treillis de Galois&quot; (Galois lattice).

With these derivation operators, Wille gave an elegant definition of a formal concept:

a pair (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) is a &quot;formal concept&quot; of a context provided that:

:&quot;A&quot; ⊆ &quot;G&quot;, &quot;B&quot; ⊆ &quot;M&quot;, &#x27; = &quot;B&quot;, and &#x27; = &quot;A&quot;.

Equivalently and more intuitively, (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) is a formal concept precisely when:
* every object in &quot;A&quot; has every attribute in &quot;B&quot;,
* for every object in &quot;G&quot; that is not in &quot;A&quot;, there is some attribute in &quot;B&quot; that the object does not have,
* for every attribute in &quot;M&quot; that is not in &quot;B&quot;, there is some object in &quot;A&quot; that does not have that attribute.

For computing purposes, a formal context may be naturally represented as a (0,1)-matrix &quot;K&quot; in which the rows correspond to the objects, the columns correspond to the attributes, and each entry &quot;k&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot; equals to 1 if &quot;object &quot;i&quot; has attribute &quot;j&quot;.&quot; In this matrix representation, each formal concept corresponds to a maximal submatrix (not necessarily contiguous) all of whose elements equal 1. It is however misleading to consider a formal context as &quot;boolean&quot;, because the negated incidence (&quot;object &quot;g&quot; does not have attribute &quot;m&quot;&quot;) is not concept forming in the same way as defined above. For this reason, the values 1 and 0 or TRUE and FALSE are usually avoided when representing formal contexts, and a symbol like × is used to express incidence.

== Concept lattice of a formal context ==
The concepts (&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot;) of a context &quot;K&quot; can be (partially) ordered by the inclusion of extents, or, equivalently, by the dual inclusion of intents. An order ≤ on the concepts is defined as follows: for any two concepts (&quot;A&quot;1, &quot;B&quot;1) and (&quot;A&quot;2, &quot;B&quot;2) of &quot;K&quot;, we say that (&quot;A&quot;1, &quot;B&quot;1) ≤ (&quot;A&quot;2, &quot;B&quot;2) precisely when &quot;A&quot;1 ⊆ &quot;A&quot;2. Equivalently, (&quot;A&quot;1, &quot;B&quot;1) ≤ (&quot;A&quot;2, &quot;B&quot;2) whenever &quot;B&quot;1 ⊇ &quot;B&quot;2.

In this order, every set of formal concepts has a greatest common subconcept, or meet. Its extent consists of those objects that are common to all extents of the set. Dually, every set of formal concepts has a &quot;least common superconcept&quot;, the intent of which comprises all attributes which all objects of that set of concepts have.

These meet and join operations satisfy the axioms defining a lattice, in fact a complete lattice. Conversely, it can be shown that every complete lattice is the concept lattice of some formal context (up to isomorphism).

== Attribute values and negation ==
Real-world data is often given in the form of an object-attribute table, where the attributes have &quot;values&quot;. Formal concept analysis handles such data by transforming them into the basic type of a (&quot;one-valued&quot;) formal context. The method is called &quot;conceptual scaling&quot;.

The negation of an attribute &quot;m&quot; is an attribute ¬&quot;m&quot;, the extent of which is just the complement of the extent of &quot;m&quot;, i.e., with (¬&quot;m&quot;) = G \ &quot;&quot;. It is in general &quot;not&quot; assumed that negated attributes are available for concept formation. But pairs of attributes which are negations of each other often naturally occur, for example in contexts derived from conceptual scaling.

For possible negations of formal concepts see the section concept algebras below.

== Implications ==
An &quot;implication&quot; &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; relates two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of attributes and expresses that every object possessing each attribute from &quot;A&quot; also has each attribute from &quot;B&quot;. When is a formal context and &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; are subsets of the set &quot;M&quot; of attributes (i.e., &quot;A,B&quot; ⊆ &quot;M&quot;), then the implication &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; &quot;is valid&quot; if &#x27; ⊆ &#x27;. For each finite formal context, the set of all valid implications has a &quot;canonical basis&quot;, an irredundant set of implications from which all valid implications can be derived by the natural inference (Armstrong rules). This is used in &quot;attribute exploration&quot;, a knowledge acquisition method based on implications.

== Arrow relations ==
Formal concept analysis has elaborate mathematical foundations, making the field versatile. As a basic example we mention the &quot;arrow relations&quot;, which are simple and easy to compute, but very useful. They are defined as follows: For and let

and dually

Since only non-incident object-attribute pairs can be related, these relations can conveniently be recorded in the table representing a formal context. Many lattice properties can be read off from the arrow relations, including distributivity and several of its generalizations. They also reveal structural information and can be used for determining, e.g., the congruence relations of the lattice.

== Extensions of the theory ==
* Triadic concept analysis replaces the binary incidence relation between objects and attributes by a ternary relation between objects, attributes, and conditions. An incidence then expresses that &quot;the object has the attribute under the condition &quot;. Although &quot;triadic concepts&quot; can be defined in analogy to the formal concepts above, the theory of the &quot;trilattices&quot; formed by them is much less developed than that of concept lattices, and seems to be difficult. Voutsadakis has studied the &quot;n&quot;-ary case.
* Fuzzy concept analysis: Extensive work has been done on a fuzzy version of formal concept analysis.
* Concept algebras: Modelling negation of formal concepts is somewhat problematic because the complement of a formal concept (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) is in general not a concept. However, since the concept lattice is complete one can consider the join (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;)Δ of all concepts (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;) that satisfy ; or dually the meet (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;)𝛁 of all concepts satisfying . These two operations are known as &quot;weak negation&quot; and &quot;weak opposition&quot;, respectively. This can be expressed in terms of the &quot;derivation operators&quot;. Weak negation can be written as , and weak opposition can be written as . The concept lattice equipped with the two additional operations Δ and 𝛁 is known as the &quot;concept algebra&quot; of a context. Concept algebras generalize power sets. Weak negation on a concept lattice &quot;L&quot; is a &quot;weak complementation&quot;, i.e. an order-reversing map which satisfies the axioms . Weak opposition is a dual weak complementation. A (bounded) lattice such as a concept algebra, which is equipped with a weak complementation and a dual weak complementation, is called a &quot;weakly dicomplemented lattice&quot;. Weakly dicomplemented lattices generalize distributive orthocomplemented lattices, i.e. Boolean algebras.

=== Temporal concept analysis ===
Temporal concept analysis (TCA) is an extension of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) aiming at a conceptual description of temporal phenomena. It provides animations in concept lattices obtained from data about changing objects. It offers a general way of understanding change of concrete or abstract objects in continuous, discrete or hybrid space and time. TCA applies conceptual scaling to temporal data bases.

In the simplest case TCA considers objects that change in time like a particle in physics, which, at each time, is at exactly one place. That happens in those temporal data where the attributes &#x27;temporal object&#x27; and &#x27;time&#x27; together form a key of the data base. Then the state (of a temporal object at a time in a view) is formalized as a certain object concept of the formal context describing the chosen view. In this simple case, a typical visualization of a temporal system is a line diagram of the concept lattice of the view into which trajectories of temporal objects are embedded.
TCA generalizes the above mentioned case by considering temporal data bases with an arbitrary key. That leads to the notion of distributed objects which are at any given time at possibly many places, as for example, a high pressure zone on a weather map. The notions of &#x27;temporal objects&#x27;, &#x27;time&#x27; and &#x27;place&#x27; are represented as formal concepts in scales. A state is formalized as a set of object concepts.
That leads to a conceptual interpretation of the ideas of particles and waves in physics.

== Algorithms and tools==
There are a number of simple and fast algorithms for generating formal concepts and for constructing and navigating concept lattices. For a survey, see Kuznetsov and Obiedkov or the book by Ganter and Obiedkov, where also some pseudo-code can be found. Since the number of formal concepts may be exponential in the size of the formal context, the complexity of the algorithms usually is given with respect to the output size. Concept lattices with a few million elements can be handled without problems.

Many FCA software applications are available today. The main purpose of these tools varies from formal context creation to formal concept mining and generating the concepts lattice of a given formal context and the corresponding implications and association rules. Most of these tools are academic open-source applications, such as:
* ConExp
* ToscanaJ
* Lattice Miner
* Coron
* FcaBedrock
* GALACTIC

== Related analytical techniques ==
=== Bicliques ===
A formal context can naturally be interpreted as a bipartite graph. The formal concepts then correspond to the maximal bicliques in that graph. The mathematical and algorithmic results of formal concept analysis may thus be used for the theory of maximal bicliques. The notion of bipartite dimension (of the complemented bipartite graph) translates to that of &quot;Ferrers dimension&quot; (of the formal context) and of order dimension (of the concept lattice) and has applications e.g. for Boolean matrix factorization.

=== Biclustering and multidimensional clustering ===
Given an object-attribute numerical data-table, the goal of biclustering is to group together some objects having similar values of some attributes. For example, in gene expression data, it is known that genes (objects) may share a common behavior for a subset of biological situations (attributes) only: one should accordingly produce local patterns to characterize biological processes, the latter should possibly overlap, since a gene may be involved in several processes. The same remark applies for recommender systems where one is interested in local patterns characterizing groups of users that strongly share almost the same tastes for a subset of items.

A bicluster in a binary object-attribute data-table is a pair &quot;(A,B)&quot; consisting of an inclusion-maximal set of objects &quot;A&quot; and an inclusion-maximal set of attributes &quot;B&quot; such that almost all objects from &quot;A&quot; have almost all attributes from &quot;B&quot; and vice versa.

Of course, formal concepts can be considered as &quot;rigid&quot; biclusters where all objects have all attributes and vice versa. Hence, it is not surprising that some bicluster definitions coming from practice are just definitions of a formal concept. Relaxed FCA-based versions of biclustering and triclustering include OA-biclustering and OAC-triclustering (here O stands for object, A for attribute, C for condition); to generate patterns these methods use prime operators only once being applied to a single entity (e.g. object) or a pair of entities (e.g. attribute-condition), respectively.

A bicluster of similar values in a numerical object-attribute data-table is usually defined as a pair consisting of an inclusion-maximal set of objects and an inclusion-maximal set of attributes having similar values for the objects. Such a pair can be represented as an inclusion-maximal rectangle in the numerical table, modulo rows and columns permutations. In it was shown that biclusters of similar values correspond to triconcepts of a triadic context where the third dimension is given by a scale that represents numerical attribute values by binary attributes.

This fact can be generalized to &quot;n&quot;-dimensional case, where &quot;n&quot;-dimensional clusters of similar values in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional data are represented by &quot;n+1&quot;-dimensional concepts. This reduction allows one to use standard definitions and algorithms from multidimensional concept analysis for computing multidimensional clusters.

=== Knowledge spaces ===
In the theory of knowledge spaces it is assumed that in any knowledge space the family of &quot;knowledge states&quot; is union-closed. The complements of knowledge states therefore form a closure system and may be represented as the extents of some formal context.

== Hands-on experience with formal concept analysis ==
The formal concept analysis can be used as a qualitative method for data analysis. Since the early beginnings of FCA in the early 1980s, the FCA research group at TU Darmstadt has gained experience from more than 200 projects using the FCA (as of 2005). Including the fields of: medicine and cell biology, genetics, ecology, software engineering, ontology, information and library sciences, office administration, law, linguistics, political science.

Many more examples are e.g. described in: &quot;Formal Concept Analysis. Foundations and Applications&quot;, conference papers at regular conferences such as: &quot;International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis&quot; (ICFCA), &quot;Concept Lattices and their Applications&quot; (CLA), or &quot;International Conference on Conceptual Structures&quot; (ICCS).

<text>&quot;The Uneasy Case for Copyright: A Study of Copyright in Books, Photocopies, and Computer Programs&quot; was an article in the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; by future United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in 1970, while he was still a legal academic. The article was a challenge to copyright expansionism, which was just entering its modern phase, and was still largely unquestioned in the United States. It became one of the most widely cited skeptical examinations of copyright.

In this piece, Breyer made several points:

* That the only defensible justification of copyright is a consequentialist economic balance between maximizing the distribution of works and encouraging their production.
* That there is significant historical, logical, and anecdotal evidence which shows that exclusive rights will provide only limited increases in the volume of literary production, particularly within certain sections of the book market.
* That there was limited justification for contemporary expansions in the scope and duration of copyright.

There was a formal reply by law student Barry W. Tyerman in the &quot;UCLA Law Review&quot;, and a rejoinder by Breyer, but the article appears to have had little impact on copyright policy in the lead up to the Copyright Act of 1976.

Seventeen years later, in their mathematical law and economics article &quot;An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law&quot; (1989), William Landes and Richard Posner systematically analyzed each of Breyer&#x27;s arguments and concluded that &quot;they do not make a persuasive case for eliminating copyright protection.&quot; In particular they noted that many of his arguments rested on imperfect copying technology, an argument which weakens with technological innovation.

<text>Castlefield is an inner-city conservation area in Manchester, North West England. The conservation area which bears its name is bounded by the River Irwell, Quay Street, Deansgate and Chester Road. It was the site of the Roman era fort of Mamucium or Mancunium which gave its name to Manchester. It was the terminus of the Bridgewater Canal, the world&#x27;s first industrial canal, built in 1764; the oldest canal warehouse opened in 1779. The world&#x27;s first passenger railway terminated here in 1830, at Liverpool Road railway station and the first railway warehouse opened here in 1831.

The Rochdale Canal met the Bridgewater Canal at Castlefield in 1805 and in the 1830s they were linked with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation by two short cuts. In 1848 the two viaducts of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway crossed the area and joined each other, two further viaducts and one mainline station Manchester Central railway station followed. It has a tram station, Deansgate-Castlefield tram stop (formerly G-Mex) providing frequent Manchester Metrolink services to Eccles, Bury, Altrincham, Manchester Piccadilly, East Didsbury and Rochdale.

Castlefield was designated a conservation area in 1980 and the United Kingdom&#x27;s first designated urban heritage park in 1982.

==Toponymy==
The name Castlefield refers to the settlement&#x27;s position below the former Roman fort. It is a contracted version of the earlier name Castle-in-the-field. Another name for the area was Campfield, which derived from the same source. It is preserved in the name of St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Campfield, and Campfield Market. (Manchester also derived its name from the fort.)

An older name for the settlement was the Old English Aldport, meaning old or long used port, distinguishing it from the new port at medieval Manchester nearer the confluence of the Rivers Irk and Irwell. &quot;Port&quot; in Old English could refer to a harbour or a market so the names could be old and new market.

==History==

===Roman period===

A Roman fort (&quot;&quot;), Mamucium or Mancunium was established in what is now Castlefield around AD 79 near a crossing place on the River Medlock. The fort was sited on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the River Medlock and Irwell in a naturally defensible position. It was erected as a series of fortifications established by Gnaeus Julius Agricola during his campaign against the Brigantes, who were the Celtic tribe in control of most of northern England. It guarded a central stage of the Roman road (equivalent to Watling Street), between Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York). Another road branched off to the north to Bremetennacum (Ribchester). The neighbouring forts were Castleshaw and Northwich. Built first from turf and timber, the fort was demolished around 140. When it was rebuilt around 160, it was again of turf and timber construction. Around the year 200, the fort underwent another rebuild enhancing its defences by replacing the gatehouse in stone and facing the walls with stone. The fort would have been garrisoned by an infantry cohort of around 500 auxiliary troops.

Evidence of pagan and Christian worship has been discovered. Two altars have been found and there may be a temple of Mithras at the site. A word square was discovered in the 1970s that may be one of the earliest evidences of Christianity in Britain. A civilian settlement (&quot;&quot;) grew in association with the fort, made up of traders and the soldiers&#x27; families. An area which has a concentration of furnaces and industrial activity has been described as an industrial estate. The civilian settlement was probably abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although a small garrison may have remained at Mamucium into the late third and early fourth centuries.

A reconstructed part of the fort stands on the site and is open to the public.

===Medieval and early modern periods===
The village of Manchester later became established a kilometre to the north and the area around the &quot;vicus&quot; became known as &quot;Aldport&quot; or &quot;The Old Town&quot;. A house and park here became the home of the Mosley family in 1601 but, in 1642, after being used by Lord Strange as a royalist headquarters during the Siege of Manchester, it was burned down by parliamentarians.

The River Irwell was made navigable in 1720s, leading to the construction of a quay in the area for loading and unloading of goods (vessels of up to 50 tons could dock here and ply between Manchester and Liverpool).

===Industrialisation===
The Bridgewater Canal arrived in Castlefield in July 1761, around the time the Industrial Revolution is considered to have started. The Rochdale Canal, and a network of private branch canals joined the Bridgewater at Lock 92 in Castlefield. The Bridgewater Canal company hesitated in connecting their canal the adjacent Mersey and Irwell Navigation until the Rochdale Canal Company had almost constructed its Manchester and Salford Junction Canal, and the railways had arrived in the 1830s. As the century progressed the canals gave way to the railways and the area became dissected by a network of railway lines carried on a series of multi-arch viaducts. Though Castlefield did have cotton mills, it was the engineering works and warehousing that was more noticeable. The first canal warehouse, built in 1771 on Coal Wharf, was used to raise coal from the barges to street level, and store other goods. In the nineteenth century the warehouses assumed other functions such as trans-shipment which involved receiving trains or barges, and reassembling their loads to be shipped to other destinations. Other warehouses received raw materials such as yarn, which was collected by outworkers who then returned woven cloth. The later warehouses acted as showrooms on the ground floors, with offices and storage above and behind.

===20th century===
During the 20th century both canal and railway transport declined and the area became somewhat derelict. The railway complex in Liverpool Road was sold to a conservation group for a nominal £1 and became the Greater Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. In 1982 the area was designated as an urban heritage park and a part of the fort was reconstructed on the excavated foundations.

==Present day==

As part of the renewal of the site, an extensive outdoor area was developed as an events arena which is used for a wide variety of events, including the annual &#x27;Dpercussion&#x27; music festival. Granada Television studios are located in the area along with the now closed Granada Studios Tour. In 2008 it was reported that ITV were considering re-opening the tour as the company is searching for new forms of revenue to restore growth.

Castlefield has several bars and restaurants which are particularly popular during the summer months when people flock to the area to enjoy the large outdoor drinking areas and regular live music events. The popular Barça Bar closed in late December 2008, leaving Dukes 92, Choice Bar &amp; Restaurant and Lava Bar as the only bars within the Castlefield basin. 

Castle Quay is the home of Bauer Media&#x27;s network centre, housing national radio stations Hits Radio and Greatest Hits Radio.

Planning permission to turn the empty Jackson&#x27;s Wharf building into a modern five-storey block of flats by the Peel Group was rejected for a second time in 2008. In 2011, planning permission was rejected again by Manchester City Council with opposition from locals. Peel subsequently decided to sell the building and it is now a gastropub.

In 1996 an architectural design competition was launched to create Timber Wharf by developers Urban Splash and RIBA Competitions to design a new housing type capable of being mass-produced, using modern building techniques on a realistic budget to challenge the preconceived notions of volume house building. 162 entries were submitted for the project and Glenn Howells Architects provided the winning entry, the building was completed in 2002 and has since gone on to win a number of awards.
==Geography==

Castlefield is in the Deansgate ward, in Manchester City Centre. To the west is the River Irwell and Salford, to the south lie the Bridgewater Canal, the River Medlock and the Rochdale Canal.

The land between the two rivers consists primarily of a plateau of Collyhurst sandstone, which is deep red in colour. This can be seen in the exposed river cliffs around the Castlefield basin, and provides a solid foundation for multistorey buildings and also an easily workable rock for cutting culverts and tunnels.

;Area description
The River Medlock makes an end-on connection with the Bridgewater Canal at Knott Mill Bridge. Originally surplus water was diverted, via a tippler weir, into an overflow tunnel passing under the basin and emerging just to the north of the overspill from the Giant&#x27;s Basin. The tippler weir has been replaced with a conventional weir within the basin. The 1848 OS large scale map shows the original course as following the line of the canal as far as the coal wharf (site of the Giant&#x27;s Basin). The River Irwell forms two gigantic meanders around Manchester and Salford; these too have had to be heavily controlled, for the Irwell was straightened and deepened from 1724, forming the Mersey and Irwell Navigation with quays built along Water Street in 1740. Most of the navigation was abandoned in the 1890s, with the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal but a deep water channel was maintained up to the Woden Street footbridge. Two canals define Castlefield: the Bridgewater built in 1761 and the Rochdale opened in 1804. There are however two more short canals within Castlefield that form links with the Irwell, these are the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal and the Hulme Locks Branch Canal, both being disused but both are still visible. The Bridgewater Hall basin on the former has been restored. Over the Irwell from Water Street is the entrance to the Manchester, Bolton &amp; Bury Canal.

==Landmarks==
===Canals===

Before 1750, roads were an impractical way of transporting heavy goods and water transport on the rivers was the accepted method. The number of suitable rivers was limited. Power to drive machinery was also derived from water but this needed fast-flowing streams where a head could be built up to turn the waterwheels. Finding the two types of water at the same locality was rare. Castlefield could use the River Medlock, as it fell to join the River Irwell to turn the wheels, but the Irwell needed to be improved to make it a safe river to navigate.

Eight locks were constructed between 1724 and 1734, along the Rivers Irwell and Mersey; this was known as the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. Short cuts were dug to eliminate the difficult bends. Wharfs were built at Manchester Wharf, Water Street in 1740, and if the wind was not in the east small boats could travel from there to the sea. The navigation was subject to continuous improvement and was eventually superseded by the Manchester Ship Canal.

 The Bridgewater Canal was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to transport coal from his mines in Worsley to Manchester. It was built by James Brindley and is the world&#x27;s first true industrial canal, and Britain&#x27;s first arterial canal. It opened to Castlefield in 1761 and fully to Liverpool in 1766. Castlefield was the Manchester basin, and it was watered by the River Medlock. The actual river was culverted under the basin and emerged by Potato Wharf, then flowed into the Irwell at Hulme Locks. The basin also was watered by ground water runoff, and in times of heavy rain, a weir was needed to maintain the water level. Brindley built a clover leaf-shaped weir which was replaced by the Giant&#x27;s Basin. Today this appears as a 7-metre-deep, 7-metre-wide circular sump, crossed by an iron footbridge. The basin allowed other goods to be transported into the city such as cotton (from 1784) and building materials and foodstuffs. The basin, and the proximate Bridgewater Canal Basin at Potato Wharf are Grade II listed structures.

In 1802 the Rochdale Canal joined here at Duke&#x27;s Lock, lock 92; this was the first canal to cross the Pennines; it brought with it clean water from its feeder reservoir at Hollingworth Lake. It connected with the Ashton Canal and the Peak Forest Canal bringing building limestone from Bugsworth in Derbyshire. At that time, major warehouses and mills would cut private canal arms to their buildings, the Rochdale had many.

In 1837, the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal was connected to the Irwell, and there was commercial pressure to connect the Bridgewater/Rochdale to them. The Manchester and Salford Junction Canal, 1837, was cut from the Rochdale under the city to provide the link with the Irwell at Quay street. To preempt this, the Bridgewater Canal Company built the Hulme Locks Branch Canal, completing it in 1831. This canal remained open until 1991, when it was replaced by a lock at Pomona No. 3 basin.

These canals did not have the capacity to take boats larger than 1.4 m wide, so trans-shipment to oceangoing vessels was needed at a point outside the city. The Manchester Ship Canal, the long river navigation was designed to give the city of Manchester direct access to the sea, and was built between 1887 and 1894 at a cost of about £15 million (£1.27 billion as of 2010), and in its day was the largest navigation canal in the world. Though the main docks were at Salford Quays and Pomona Docks the ship canal started at the Woden Street footbridge at Hulme Locks.

===Warehouses of Castlefield===

The Duke&#x27;s Warehouse was built at the end Bridgewater Canal over the River Medlock. It has long since gone. It was first built in 1771, destroyed by fire in 1789 and rebuilt and extended including a fulling mill on the southern bank and cottages on the northern bank. It was destroyed again by fire in 1919. Built at the same time was the Grocers Warehouse 19.4 x 9.7m. This was a five-storey warehouse with one then two shipping holes. It was cut back into the Collyhurst sandstone river cliff face to the north of the Medlock. It was designed by James Brindley and incorporated a waterwheel driven hoist system. The canal arm was continued into a tunnel in the cliff. It was modified and extended in the first decade of the 19th century when the Rochdale canal was cut behind it. The tunnel was severed and became an arm of the Rochdale Canal. Part of the facade has been restored and the canal arms are bridged by two Dutch style lifting bridges.

The Merchants&#x27; Warehouse (46.2 m x 15.4m) was built on the north bank at the entrance to the Giant&#x27;s Basin around 1827. This was a four-storey warehouse with two shipping holes. On the street side it had six side loading bays topped by wooden catsheads (hoods). It has been badly damaged by fire but has since been rebuilt by Jim Ramsbottom and converted into offices. The other surviving warehouse is the Middle Warehouse built in 1831 by the Bridgewater Trustees on the south bank, off the Middle Basin canal arm. It was in use to store maize until the 1970s. It has been converted into a restaurant, offices and flats. It is five storeys plus an attic. The two shipping holes are enclosed in an elliptical blind arch.

The Kenworthy Warehouse, was 19m x 47m was built in 1840 and looked like others. It was six storeys high, had twin shipping hole and was built on an arm running east of the Giant&#x27;s Basin. It was designed for heavy goods: the ground floor was used for oil, the first for shipping goods, then the other floors for cotton, flour and grain. In 1897, the Great Northern Viaduct was built over it and the piers modified the canal arms.

The Staffordshire Warehouse sat abridge the Staffordshire arms of the basin and was used to warehouse cotton.

The New Warehouse was built on Slate Wharf before 1848, and was the largest. It was six storeys high, with 20 14 ft bays thus in length.

The Victoria and Albert Warehouses are not at the basin, but at the junction of the River Irwell and the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal. This L-shaped building was built flush with the canal for direct loading, on the street side there were three loading entrances.
Also significant is the 1830 Railway Warehouse of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. This was built with
There was no available water to drive the hoists, so for the first year they were manual, but in 1832 they were powered by a small steam engine.

Possibly the last of Castlefield&#x27;s great warehouses was the Great Northern Warehouse of 1896 to 1898. This was a trans-shipment warehouse that had railway access on two of its floors, road access and canal arms from the Manchester and Salford Junction canal in the basement. This was one of Britain&#x27;s first large steel-framed buildings (81m x 66m). There were hydraulic lifts capable of raising fully laden railway waggons between the floors. To service the building the Great Northern Viaduct was built parallel to the Cornbrook Viaduct over the basin, and over the Kenworthy Warehouse. The country&#x27;s longest Victorian commercial terrace was built to mask it from Deansgate.

Textile warehouses in the Italianate palazzo style were built in other parts of Manchester city centre, notably King Street in the 1840s spreading to Portland Street, Charlotte Street and by the start of the 20th century, Whitworth Street. In all covering over a square mile of the city centre, Manchester was called Warehouse City and arguably was the finest example of Victorian commercialism.

===Bridges of Castlefield===
The canal basin at Castlefield is crossed by four large railway viaducts dating from 1848, 1877 and 1898.

The southern viaduct in the group of three is the 1849 red brick viaduct of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway with its cast iron arch bridge over the Rochdale Canal. It carried the double tracks between Manchester Piccadilly via Oxford Road station and Knott Mill railway station, then turns south-west, crosses the canal basin and heads for Altrincham.
Designated as No.100A, it forms part of the long brick viaduct taking the Altrincham branch of the Manchester South Junction &amp; Altrincham Railway through Knott Mill Station. The bridge, designed by William Baker, spans 31.9m. It has six cast iron ribs each made in five pieces and bolted together. The ribs are braced with cruciform cast iron sections. The twin railway tracks were carried on cast iron deck plates. The resident engineer was Henry Hemberow, and the sections were cast by Garforths of Dukinfield. The MSJ&amp;A Railway was Manchester&#x27;s first suburban railway line.
A second cast iron rib arch bridge by Baker passed over Egerton Street but this was reconstructed in steel in 1976.

The central one in the group of three southwest of Deansgate Station is the high-level iron truss girder viaduct of 1877 built for the Cheshire Lines Committee by the Midland Railway. It&#x27;s known as Cornbrook Viaduct. The viaduct is a red brick and wrought iron truss girder construction. When it opened in 1877, it carried trains coming from a temporary station to Irlam and Warrington, and Chorlton via a branch line. The temporary station was replaced by Sir John Fowler&#x27;s Manchester Central Station in 1880, which operated until 1969 and is now used as an exhibition centre (Manchester Central).

To the north is the 1894 Great Northern viaduct that served the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s warehouse in Deansgate. The high-level tubular steel viaduct is decorated with turrets. It was built for the Great Northern Railway Company and carried GNR trains to the company&#x27;s Deansgate warehouse until 1963. Richard Johnson who was a Chief Engineer of the GNR was responsible for the design.

The Cornbrook and Great Northern viaducts stood disused for many years. When a route for the Metrolink trams was investigated, the Cornbrook Viaduct was found to be in much better condition than the 1894 one. It was chosen for refurbishment (1990–1991) and is currently used by Metrolink trams going to Altrincham.

The Salford branch viaduct, the fourth viaduct, was separate from the others. It was also built by the Manchester South Junction &amp; Altrincham Railway in 1848–1849. It uses a brick arch to cross the Staffordshire arm of the basin, before passing under the later Cornbrook and Great Northern viaduct and intersected with the then main line to Altrincham at a point about 300m west of Knott Mill Station.
The whole viaduct from Piccadilly to Ordsall Junction is long and consists of 224 brick arches. There were six cast iron bridges that span Water Street, the Rochdale Canal, Castle Street and Chester Road, Deansgate Station, Oxford Road (encased in concrete in 1959) and over Albion Street (renewed in reinforced concrete in 1980). They were all designed by William Baker and have a similar construction, with six cast iron arches each made in three or five sections.

During the regeneration of the Castlefield basin, a spectacular footbridge was built from Slate Wharf to Catalan Square. This is the Merchant&#x27;s Bridge, where the 3m wide deck is hung by 13 hangers from the steel arches. The span is 40m. The designers, Whitby and Bird acknowledge the influence of Santiago Calatrava.

A couple of modern but traditional looking cast iron clad steel footbridges built by Marsh Bros Engineers, Bakewell 1990 have been thrown over some arms. In addition Dutch style lifting bridges have been built at Slate Wharf and Grocers Warehouse. An interesting stone-clad footbridge has been built over the Rochdale Canal. This is called the Architect&#x27;s bridge.

George Stephenson&#x27;s line crossed the River Irwell by a skew-arched masonry bridge built in 1830, to the north of the canal basin and then Water Street; this bridge is the first recorded use of the Hodgkinson beam, (or I-beam).

===Other prominent buildings===
The Liverpool Road railway station complex is significant as it was here that the passenger terminus was invented, and concepts such as separate facilities for the rich and the poor first appear here. The station is the oldest mainline station in the world.
The booking hall for first and second class passengers was on Liverpool Road, and there were separate stairs up to the separate first floor waiting rooms and the platform. There was a sundial over the first class entrance, since up to 1847, Manchester Corporation used &#x27;local time&#x27; and that was set by the sun. In 1847, the Corporation adopted &#x27;railway time&#x27;. Adjoining the station are the 1830 warehouse (300 ft X 70 ft) with 6 spur tracks, and the three-storey long, No. 1 Cotton Store built in 1831, and the similar No. 2 Cotton Store. However this was period of rapid expansion. The 1830 warehouse had been built within 4 months by David Bellhouse Jnr. In 1837, the station buildings were extended by the Grand Junction Railway and a new goods shed built. Warehouses now covered , and had a floor area of . The passenger station closed on 4 May 1844 when the line was extended to join the Manchester and Leeds Railway at a new station situated in Hunt&#x27;s Bank and it all became a freight terminal. The cotton stores and the goods sheds were demolished in the 1860s when the London and North Western Railway expanded the goods station.

In 1844 there were six railway lines connecting the world to Manchester, and Léon Faucher commented that there were 15 or 16 seats of industry that formed this great constellation.

Two more railway warehouses can be seen, the 1869 London and North Western Railway Bonded Warehouse on Grape Street with its separate viaduct over Water Street and the four-storey 1880 Great Western Railway Lower Byrom Street Warehouse. The Lower Byrom Street Warehouse is now part of the Museum of Science and Industry, while the Grape Street warehouse is used by Granada Studios as studios, rehearsal space and offices.

==Regeneration==
Castlefield regeneration dates from 1972, when the Greater Manchester Council carried out archaeological investigations in the area. The Liverpool Road goods depot closed 8 September 1975, and the GMC made a survey of the site and it became the North Western Museum of Science and Industry in 1978.

Through the joint efforts of the Civic Trust, the Georgian Group, the Victorian Society and Manchester Region Industrial Archaeology Society (MRIAS) a report called Historic Castlefield was published in 1979, which set upon a development framework.
Also in 1979 Castlefield was designated a conservation area even though most of its historic canals and buildings were derelict. The major landowner was the Manchester Ship Canal Company. The area&#x27;s potential had been recognised and the 1982 City Centre Local Plan actively supported the Museum of Science and Industry at Liverpool Road, and the Castlefield Conservation Area Steering Committee, (CCASC) was formed.

Castlefield designated itself Britain&#x27;s first Urban Heritage Park in 1983. This led to £40m of public sector funding being invested for regeneration.

In 1988 the Central Manchester Development Corporation was created to formulate a regeneration policy for nearly 187 ha of central Manchester (approximately 40% of the city centre) and to pump-prime private sector development using Government grants. This embraced Castlefield.

The Corporation determined that Castlefield should be revitalised by strengthening the tourism base, consolidating and supporting business activity and establishing a vibrant residential community. The imaginative and sensitive conservation and enhancement of the listed buildings, canals, viaducts and spaces, was to be achieved with high standards of urban design.
A large number of grants now became available for public/private development partnerships.

One organisation to benefit was Jim Ramsbottom&#x27;s, Castlefield Estates company, who initiated several significant development projects, including Eastgate, Merchants Warehouse and Dukes 92.

The similarly named Castlefield Management Company was created in 1992 as a non-profit company to provide services, events and to maintain the environmental quality of the area. An Urban Ranger service was set up to assist visitors, guide tours and oversee the Urban Heritage Park.

Most of the buildings have now either been renovated or restored and many have been converted into modern apartments (warehouse flats). Numerous archaeological digs have taken place and revealed a great deal about the early history of the city. Manchester City Council have recently encouraged high quality new developments to accompany the converted warehouses and enhance the conservation area. However, key sites remain to be completed, and Ian Simpson&#x27;s proposals for a massive eight-storey block of apartments at Jackson&#x27;s Wharf, has twice been rejected by the City Council reflecting vociferous local objections. For instance, the entertainer Mike Harding said:

<text>Prince Henry of Battenberg (Henry Maurice; 5 October 1858 – 20 January 1896), formerly Count Henry of Battenberg, was a morganatic descendant of the Grand Ducal House of Hesse. He became a member of the British royal family by marriage to Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom, the youngest child of Queen Victoria. Through his daughter, Victoria Eugenie, who became the queen consort of Spain, Henry is a direct ancestor of the current Spanish royal family.

Henry was born on 5 October 1858 in Milan, Lombardy–Venetia. He was the son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine, and his wife Countess Julia von Hauke. His father was the third son and fourth child of Grand Duke Ludwig II of Hesse and Wilhelmina of Baden.

His parents&#x27; marriage was morganatic, as Julia was not considered a proper wife for a prince of a reigning dynasty, being only a countess. As such, at the time of his birth, Henry could not bear his father&#x27;s title or name, and was styled &quot;His Illustrious Highness Count Henry of Battenberg&quot;. He was known as &#x27;Liko&#x27; to his family. When his mother was raised to &quot;Princess von Battenberg&quot; and given the higher style of &quot;Her Serene Highness&quot; by Alexander&#x27;s older brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse, Henry and his siblings shared in their mother&#x27;s new rank. He became &quot;His Serene Highness Prince Henry of Battenberg&quot;, although he remained ineligible to inherit the throne of Hesse or to receive a civil list stipend.

Prince Henry received a military education and took up a commission as a lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of the Rhenish Hussars in the Prussian Army. He served in the Prussian Garde du Corps and was also Honorary Colonel of the 1st Infantry Regiment of Bulgaria, where his brother Alexander was Prince.

==Marriage==
Because of their close relationship to the Grand Ducal House of Hesse, the Battenbergs came into close contact with various ruling families of Europe, including the British Royal House. In April 1884, Henry&#x27;s elder brother, Prince Louis of Battenberg, married Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, his first cousin once-removed, and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Empress of India. Shortly after that wedding, Prince Henry became engaged to Princess Beatrice, fifth daughter and youngest child of Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort. Queen Victoria agreed to the marriage on the condition that the couple make their home with her. The Queen-Empress formally gave her consent to the marriage at a meeting of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council on 27 January 1885.

On 22 July 1885, the Queen made Prince Henry a Knight Companion of the Garter, and granted him the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; to give him rank equal to his wife. This style took effect in the United Kingdom, but not in the German Empire (where the Prince was still considered a &quot;Serene Highness&quot;). 

Beatrice and Henry were married at St Mildred&#x27;s Church at Whippingham, near Osborne, on 23 July 1885.
On the same day, a bill to naturalise Prince Henry a British subject passed the House of Lords. The couple adopted the style &quot;Their Royal Highnesses Prince and Princess Henry of Battenberg&quot;.

On 22 August 1885, exactly a month after the wedding, Henry was made Honorary Colonel of the 5th (Isle of Wight, Princess Beatrice&#x27;s) Volunteer Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment, In early 1886, it was announced in &quot;The Times&quot; that he would be made a captain in the 1st Life Guards, but the Secretary of State for War (Henry Campbell-Bannerman) denied knowledge of this in the House of Commons and the appointment did not take place.

Prince and Princess Henry of Battenberg had four children. By royal warrant of 13 December 1886, the Queen granted their children the style &quot;Highness&quot;. This style took immediate effect in the United Kingdom and elsewhere except within the German Empire, where, as Princes and Princesses of Battenberg, they were only entitled to the style &quot;Serene Highness&quot;.

==Later life and death==
In 1889, Prince Henry was made Governor of Carisbrooke Castle and Captain-General and Governor of the Isle of Wight. He was made Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army on 21 June 1887, Colonel on 22 February 1893 and appointed to the Privy Council on 20 November 1894.

In November 1895, Prince Henry persuaded Queen Victoria to allow him to go to West Africa to fight in the Ashanti War. He served as the military secretary to the commander-in-chief of British forces, Colonel Sir Francis Scott. He contracted malaria when the expedition reached Prahsu, about from Kumasi, and subsequently died aboard the cruiser HMS &quot;Blonde&quot; stationed off the coast of Sierra Leone.

His body was repatriated by the cruiser HMS &quot;Blenheim&quot; from the Canary Islands and his funeral service took place on 5 February 1896, at the same St. Mildred&#x27;s Church, Whippingham, on the Isle of Wight, where he had been married. Interment followed in what became known as the Battenberg Chapel. The remains of his wife, Princess Beatrice, were placed there in August 1945, and those of his eldest son, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, in July 1961.

Beatrice&#x27;s sister Louise told Sir James Reid of &quot;Prince Henry&#x27;s attempted relations with her, which she had declined.&quot;

In 1896, Victoria erected a memorial to Prince Henry in the form of a Celtic cross, near Connachat Cottage in the grounds of Balmoral Castle. It is inscribed &quot;Brief Life! In sport and war so keen, morned by these winds in heath and fir as where the falling breakers stir the pains that crowned thy closing scene&quot;.

<text>Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past (; in English, &quot;Memories of the Future: Unsolved Mysteries of the Past&quot;) is a book written in 1968 by Erich von Däniken and translated from the original German by Michael Heron. It involves the hypothesis that the technologies and religions of many ancient civilizations were given to them by ancient astronauts who were welcomed as gods.

The first draft of the publication had been rejected by a variety of publishers. The book was extensively rewritten by its editor, Wilhelm Roggersdorf (a pen name of the German screenwriter Wilhelm Utermann).

==Summary==

The main thesis of &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot; is that extraterrestrial beings influenced ancient technology. Von Däniken suggests that some ancient structures and artifacts appear to reflect more sophisticated technological knowledge than is known or presumed to have existed at the times they were manufactured. Von Däniken maintains that these artifacts were produced either by extraterrestrial visitors or by humans who learned the necessary knowledge from extraterrestrials. 

Such artifacts include the Egyptian pyramids, Stonehenge, and the Moai of Easter Island. Further examples include an early world map known as the Piri Reis map, which von Däniken describes as showing Earth as it is seen from space, and the Nazca Lines in Peru, which he suggests may have been constructed by humans as crude replicas of previous alien structures, as a way to call the aliens back to Earth. He uses this same explanation to argue that cart ruts in Malta may have had extraterrestrial purposes along with similar lines in Australia, Saudi Arabia, and the Aral Sea.

The book also suggests that ancient artwork throughout the world can be interpreted as depicting astronauts, air and space vehicles, extraterrestrials, and complex technology. Von Däniken describes elements that he believes are similar in the art of unrelated cultures. Among the artwork he describes are ancient Japanese &quot;Dogū&quot; figurines (which he believes to resemble astronauts in spacesuits) and 3,000-year-old carvings in an Egyptian New Kingdom Temple that appear to depict helicopter-like machines.

The book further suggests that the origins of many religions, including interpretations of the Old Testament of the Bible, are reactions to contact with an alien race. According to von Däniken, humans considered the technology of the aliens to be supernatural and the aliens themselves to be gods. Von Däniken asks if the oral and literal traditions of most religions contain references to visitors from stars and vehicles traveling through air and space. These, he says, should be interpreted as literal descriptions which have changed during the passage of time and become more obscure.

Examples include Ezekiel&#x27;s vision of the angels and the wheels, which Von Däniken interprets as a description of a spacecraft; the Ark of the Covenant, which is explained as a device intended for communication with an alien race; and the destruction of Sodom by fire and brimstone, which is interpreted as a nuclear explosion. Von Däniken attempts to draw an analogy with the &quot;cargo cults&quot; that formed during and after World War II, when once-isolated tribes in the South Pacific mistook the advanced American and Japanese soldiers for gods.

Von Däniken also spends around one-third of the book discussing the possibility that humans could theoretically offer primitive civilizations on interstellar worlds advanced technology by the year 2100. This would, he writes, mimic the ancient extraterrestrial contact von Däniken believes to have occurred on Earth.

== Reception ==
=== Academic dismissals ===
Von Däniken&#x27;s book, and much of his subsequent publications such as &quot;Gods from Outer Space&quot; and &quot;The Gold of the Gods,&quot; have drawn largely negative receptions from the academic mainstream despite being popular best-sellers. Many scientists and historians have rejected his ideas, claiming that the book&#x27;s conclusions were based on faulty, pseudoscientific evidence, some of which was later demonstrated to be fraudulent or fabricated, and under illogical premises.

An internationally bestselling book by Clifford Wilson, &quot;Crash Go the Chariots&quot;, was published in 1972. Ronald Story&#x27;s 1976 book rebutting von Däniken&#x27;s ideas was titled &quot;The Space Gods Revealed.&quot; Another negative criticism of von Däniken&#x27;s book came from archeologist Kenneth Feder in his book &quot;Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries&quot; in 2018. Referring to von Däniken&#x27;s support of the ancient astronauts hypothesis, Feder explains how his evidence is used and presented in a misleading manner in order to convince the reader that extraterrestrial life was involved in the development of ancient civilizations.

=== Plagiarism controversies ===
Soon after the publication of &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot;, von Däniken was accused of stealing the ideas of French author Robert Charroux.

A 2004 article in &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine states that von Däniken plagiarized many of the book&#x27;s concepts from &quot;The Morning of the Magicians,&quot; that this book in turn was heavily influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos, and that the core of the ancient astronaut theory originates in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s stories &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; and &quot;At the Mountains of Madness.&quot;

=== Discredited artifact ===

One artifact offered as evidence in the book has been disclaimed by von Däniken himself. &quot;Chariots&quot; asserts that a supposedly rust-free iron pillar in India was evidence of extraterrestrial influence, but von Däniken admitted in a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview that the pillar was man-made and that as far as supporting his theories goes &quot;we can forget about this iron thing.&quot; Neither this nor any other discredited evidence, however, has been removed from subsequent editions of &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot;

=== Popular response ===
&quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; was on The New York Times bestseller list and helped to launch von Däniken&#x27;s career as a public speaker. Von Däniken had sold 70 million copies of his books as of January 2017.

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted as a German documentary film, &quot;Chariots of the Gods,&quot; produced by Terra-Filmkunst. The film was released in 1970 in West Germany and first appeared in the United States the following year. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 43rd Academy Awards in 1971.

In 1972, an edited version of the film appeared as a TV documentary called &quot;In Search of Ancient Astronauts&quot; on NBC and was produced by Alan Landsburg Productions. The documentary was narrated by Rod Serling. A follow-up called &quot;In Search of Ancient Mysteries&quot; aired the following year, also narrated by Serling. The documentary series &quot;In Search Of...,&quot; which Leonard Nimoy hosted (Serling having died in 1975), was premiered on the basis of those two &quot;pilot&quot; films.

A different TV documentary, &quot;Horizon Special: The Case of the Ancient Astronauts&quot; directed by Graham Massey, was released in 1977 and examined von Däniken&#x27;s claims.

In 1977 an eight part Polish comic adaptation of the book was created by Alfred Gorny, Arnold Mostowicz and artist Boguslaw Polch. The series was translated into 12 languages and the first four volumes were translated into English and released by Methuen Children’s Books. In 2015, the full 400 story was released in Polish by Proszynski Media under the title Ekspedycja (“The Expedition”).

In 1993, von Däniken produced a 25-part series titled &quot;Auf den Spuren der All-Mächtigen (Pathways of the Gods)&quot; for German television station, Sat.1. In 1996, a one-hour television special called, &quot;Chariots Of The Gods – The Mysteries Continue&quot;, aired on ABC and was produced by ABC/Kane. ABC/Kane produced another television special with von Däniken the following year called &quot;The Mysterious World – Search for Ancient Technology&quot;. It aired on the Discovery Channel in the United States and on RTL in Germany.

The global media rights to the book have since been purchased by Media Invest Entertainment which is developing a &quot;360-degree entertainment&quot; franchise entitled &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot;. Today, documentaries espousing alien mythology can be found on most streaming platforms and are plentiful on YouTube.

==Legacy==
&quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; spawned multiple sequels, including &quot;Gods from Outer Space&quot; and &quot;The Gods Were Astronauts&quot;. The theory in the original book is said to have influenced a variety of science fiction books, films, and television series. For instance, it is considered the inspiration for the History Channel television series, &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;.

The concept of ancient extraterrestrials has been used as a plot element in television shows and movies like &quot;Star Trek&quot; (which actually addressed the question before von Däniken&#x27;s book was published), &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise (most notably, &quot;Prometheus&quot;), &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; and &quot;The Eternals&quot;.

<text>Sultana was a commercial side-wheel steamboat which exploded and sank on the Mississippi River on April 27, 1865, killing 1,864 people in what remains the worst maritime disaster in United States history.

Constructed of wood in 1863 by the John Litherbury Boatyard in Cincinnati, Ohio, &quot;Sultana&quot; was intended for the lower Mississippi cotton trade. The steamer registered 1,719 tons and normally carried a crew of 85. For two years, she ran a regular route between St. Louis and New Orleans and was frequently commissioned to carry troops during the American Civil War. Although designed with a capacity of only 376 passengers, she was carrying 2,127 when three of the boat&#x27;s four boilers exploded and caused it to sink near Memphis, Tennessee. The disaster was overshadowed in the press by events surrounding the end of the Civil War, including the killing of President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassin John Wilkes Booth just the day before. No one was ever held accountable for the disaster.

==Construction==
Sultana was launched on January 3, 1863, the fifth steamboat to bear the name. The vessel measured long, with a width at the beam, displaced , and had a draft. Her two side-mounted paddle wheels were driven by four fire-tube boilers. Introduced in 1848, they could generate twice as much steam per fuel load as conventional boilers. Each fire-tube boiler was long and in diameter and contained 24 flues which ran from the firebox to the chimney.

The power of the boilers came with risk – the water levels in the fire tubes had to be carefully maintained at all times. The areas between the many flues clogged easily, especially since dirty river water carried much sediment, and were difficult to clean. Low water levels could cause hot spots leading to metal fatigue, significantly increasing the risk of an explosion. Since most steamboats of the time were constructed of light-weight wood covered with oil-based paint and varnish, fires were a significant concern.

==Disaster==

===Background===
Under the command of Captain James Cass Mason of St. Louis, &quot;Sultana&quot; left St. Louis on April 13, 1865, bound for New Orleans. On the morning of April 15, she was tied up at Cairo, Illinois, when word reached the city that U.S. President Abraham Lincoln had been shot in Washington, D.C. Immediately, Captain Mason grabbed an armload of Cairo newspapers and headed south to spread the news, knowing that telegraphic communication with the southern states had been almost totally cut off because of the recently-ended American Civil War.

Upon reaching Vicksburg, Mississippi, Mason was approached by Captain Reuben Hatch, the chief quartermaster at Vicksburg, with a proposal. Thousands of recently released Union prisoners of war who had been held in the Confederate prison camps at Cahaba near Selma, Alabama and Andersonville below Atlanta, Georgia, had been brought to a small parole camp outside of Vicksburg to await release to the northern states. The U.S. government would pay US$2.75 per enlisted man and US$8 per officer to any steamboat captain who would take a group north. Knowing that Mason needed money, Hatch suggested that he could guarantee Mason a full load of about 1,000 prisoners if Mason would agree to give him a kickback. Mason quickly agreed to Hatch&#x27;s offer, hoping to gain much money through this deal.

Leaving Vicksburg, &quot;Sultana&quot; traveled downriver to New Orleans, continuing to spread the news of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. On April 21, &quot;Sultana&quot; left New Orleans with about seventy cabin and deck passengers and a small amount of livestock. She also carried a crew of 85. About ten hours south of Vicksburg, one of &quot;Sultana&quot; four boilers sprang a leak. Under reduced pressure, the steamboat limped into Vicksburg to get the boiler repaired and to pick up her promised load of prisoners.

===Faulty boiler repair===
While the paroled prisoners, primarily from the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia, were brought from the parole camp to &quot;Sultana&quot;, a mechanic was brought down to work on the leaky boiler. Although the mechanic wanted to cut out and replace a ruptured seam, Mason knew such a job would take a few days and cost him his precious load of prisoners. By the time the repairs would have been completed, the prisoners would have been sent home on other boats. Instead, Mason and his chief engineer, Nathan Wintringer, convinced the mechanic to make temporary repairs, hammering back the bulged boiler plate and riveting a patch of lesser thickness over the seam. Instead of taking two or three days, the temporary repair took only one. During her time in port, and while the repairs were being made, &quot;Sultana&quot; took on the paroled prisoners.

===Overloaded===
Although Hatch had suggested that Mason might get as many as 1,000 released Union prisoners, a mix-up with the parole camp books and suspicion of bribery from other steamboat captains caused the Union officer in charge of the loading, Captain George Augustus Williams, to place every man at the parole camp on board &quot;Sultana&quot;, believing the number to be less than 1,500. Although &quot;Sultana&quot; had a legal capacity of only 376 passengers, by the time she backed away from Vicksburg on the night of April 24, she was severely overcrowded with 1,950 paroled prisoners, 22 guards from the 58th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, 70 fare-paying cabin passengers, and 85 crew members, for a total of 2,127 people. Many of the paroled prisoners had been weakened by their incarceration and associated illnesses but had managed to gain some strength while waiting at the parole camp to be officially released. The men were packed into every available space as all cabin spaces were already filled with civilian passengers; the overflow was so severe that in some places, the decks began to creak and sag and had to be supported with heavy wooden beams.

&quot;Sultana&quot; spent two days traveling upriver, fighting against one of the worst spring floods in the river&#x27;s history. At some places, the river overflowed the banks and spread out wide. Trees along the river bank were almost completely covered until only the very tops of the trees were visible above the swirling, powerful water. On April 26, &quot;Sultana&quot; stopped at Helena, Arkansas, where photographer Thomas W. Bankes took a picture of the grossly overcrowded vessel. &quot;Sultana&quot; subsequently arrived at Memphis, Tennessee, around 7:00 PM, and the crew began unloading 120 tons (109 tonnes) of sugar from the hold. Near midnight, &quot;Sultana&quot; left Memphis, leaving behind about 200 men. She then went a short distance upriver to take on a new load of coal from some coal barges and then, at about 1:00 AM, started north again.

===Explosion===
At around 2 a.m. on April 27, 1865, when &quot;Sultana&quot; was about north of Memphis, its boilers suddenly and violently exploded, killing many people instantly. First one boiler exploded, followed a split-second later by two more.

The massive steam explosion came from the top rear of the boilers. It went upward at a 45-degree angle, tearing through the crowded decks above and completely destroying the pilothouse. Without a pilot to steer the boat, &quot;Sultana&quot; became a drifting, burning hulk. The violent explosion flung some deck passengers into the water and blew a gaping - hole in the steamer. With the boilers blown to pieces, the twin smokestacks fell; the starboard smokestack fell backward into the blasted hole, and the port smokestack fell forward onto the crowded forward section of the upper deck, hitting the steamboat&#x27;s bell as it fell. The forward part of the upper deck collapsed onto the middle deck, killing and trapping many in the wreckage. Fortunately, the sturdy railings around the twin openings of the main stairway prevented the upper deck from crushing down completely onto the middle deck. The men located around the twin openings quickly crawled under the wreckage and down the main stairs. Further back, the collapsing decks formed a slope that led down into the exposed furnace boxes. The broken wood caught fire and turned the remaining superstructure into a raging inferno. Survivors panicked and raced for the safety of the water, but in their weakened condition, they soon ran out of strength and began to cling to each other. Whole groups went down together.

===Rescue attempts===
While the &quot;Sultana&quot; burned, and the men on the steamboat were either already dead or fighting for their lives, the southbound steamer &quot;Bostona&quot; (No. 2), built in 1860 but coming downriver on her maiden voyage after being refurbished, arrived at about 2:30 AM, a half hour after the explosion, and rescued scores of survivors. At the same time, dozens of people had floated down river and began to float past the Memphis waterfront, calling for help until they were noticed by the crews of docked steamboats and U.S. warships, who immediately set about rescuing the survivors. Eventually, the hulk of &quot;Sultana&quot; drifted about to the west bank of the river, burned to the waterline and sank at around 7:00 AM near Mound City and present-day Marion, Arkansas, about five hours after the explosion. Other vessels joined the rescue, including the steamers &quot;Silver Spray&quot;, &quot;Jenny Lind&quot;, and &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, the navy ironclad USS &quot;Essex&quot; and the sidewheel gunboat .

Passengers who survived the initial explosion had to risk their lives in the icy spring runoff of the Mississippi or burn with the boat. Many died of drowning or hypothermia. Some survivors were plucked from the tops of semi-submerged trees along the Arkansas shore. Bodies of victims continued to be found downriver for months, some as far as Vicksburg. Many bodies were never recovered. Most of &quot;Sultana&quot;″s officers, including Captain Mason, were among those who perished.

===Casualties===

The exact death toll is unknown, although the most recent evidence indicates that 1,864 died. On May 19, 1865, less than a month after the disaster, Brigadier general William Hoffman, Commissary General of Prisoners who investigated the disaster, reported an overall loss of soldiers, passengers, and crew of 1,238. In February 1867, the Bureau of Military Justice placed the death toll at 1,100. In 1880, the United States Congress, in conjunction with the War Department, reported the loss of life as 1,259. The official count by the United States Customs Service was 1,547. In 1880, the War Department placed the number of survivors at 931, but the most recent research places the number at just 263. The dead soldiers were interred at the Fort Pickering cemetery, located on the south shore of Memphis. A year later, when the U.S. government established the Memphis National Cemetery on the northeast side of the city, the bodies were moved there. Three civilian victims of the wreck of &quot;Sultana&quot; are interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.

===Survivors===
Because Union forces had captured Memphis in 1862 and turned it into a supply and recuperation city, numerous local hospitals treated the roughly 760 survivors with the latest medical equipment and trained personnel. Of this group, there were only 31 deaths between April 28 and June 28. Newspaper accounts indicate that the residents of Memphis had sympathy for the victims despite the ongoing Union occupation. The Chicago Opera Troupe, a minstrel group that had traveled upriver on &quot;Sultana&quot; before getting off at Memphis, staged a benefit performance, while the crew of the gunboat &quot;Essex&quot; raised US$1,000 (). 

In December 1885, the survivors living in the northern states of Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio began attending annual reunions, forming the National Sultana Survivors&#x27; Association. Eventually, the group settled on meeting in the Toledo, Ohio area. Perhaps inspired by their northern comrades, a southern group of survivors, men from Tennessee and Kentucky, began meeting in 1889 around Knoxville, Tennessee. Both groups met as close to the April 27 anniversary date as possible, corresponded with each other, and shared the title National Sultana Survivors&#x27; Association.

By the mid-1920s, only a handful of survivors could attend the reunions. In 1929, only two men attended the southern reunion. The next year, only one man showed up. The last northern survivor, Private Jordan Barr of the 15th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment, died on May 16, 1938, at age 93. The last of the southern survivors, and last overall survivor, was Private Charles M. Eldridge of the 3rd Tennessee Cavalry Regiment, who died at his home at age 96 on September 8, 1941, more than 76 years after the disaster.
===Causes===
The official cause of the &quot;Sultana&quot; disaster was determined to be the mismanagement of water levels in the boilers, exacerbated by the fact that the vessel was severely overcrowded and top-heavy. As the steamboat made her way north following the twists and turns of the river, she listed severely from side to side. Her four boilers were interconnected and mounted side-by-side so that if the boat tipped sideways, water would tend to run out of the highest boiler. The fires still going against the empty boiler created hot spots. When the boat tipped the other way, water rushing back into the empty boiler would hit the hot spots and flash instantly to steam, creating a sudden surge in pressure. This effect of careening could have been minimized by maintaining high water levels in the boilers. The official inquiry found that the boilers exploded because of the combined effects of careening, low water levels, and the faulty repair made a few days earlier.

A 2015 investigation into the cause of the disaster by Pat Jennings, principal engineer of Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, which came into existence in 1866 because of the &quot;Sultana&quot; explosion, determined that three main factors led to the disaster:

*The type of metal used in the construction of the boilers – Charcoal Hammered No. 1, which tends to become brittle with prolonged heating and cooling. Charcoal Hammered No. 1 was no longer used to manufacture boilers after 1879.

*The use of the sediment-laden Mississippi River water to feed the boilers. The sediment tended to settle on the bottom of the boilers or clog between the flues and leave hotspots.

*The design of the boilers. &quot;Sultana&quot; had tubular boilers filled with 24 horizontal five-inch flues. Being so closely packed within the diameter boilers tended to cause the muddy sediment to form hot pockets and were extremely difficult to clean. Tubular boilers were discontinued from use on steamboats plying the Lower Mississippi after two more steamboats with tubular boilers exploded shortly after the &quot;Sultana&quot; explosion.

====Traditional alternative theories====
In 1888, a St. Louis resident named William Streetor claimed that his former business partner, Robert Louden, made a confession of having sabotaged &quot;Sultana&quot; by the use of a coal torpedo while they were drinking in a saloon. Louden, a former Confederate agent and saboteur who operated in and around St. Louis, had been responsible for the burning of the steamboat &quot;Ruth&quot;. In support of Louden&#x27;s claim, what appeared to be a piece of an artillery shell was said to be recovered from the sunken wreck. However, Louden&#x27;s claim is controversial, and most scholars support the official explanation. The location of the explosion, from the top rear of the boilers and far away from the fireboxes, tends to indicate that Louden&#x27;s claim of sabotage of an exploding coal torpedo in the firebox, below the front part of the boilers, was pure bravado. Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay, the inventor of the coal torpedo, was a former resident of St. Louis and was involved in similar acts of sabotage against Union shipping interests. However, Courtenay&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Joseph Thatcher, who wrote a book on Courtenay and the coal torpedo, denies that a coal torpedo was used in the &quot;Sultana&quot; disaster.

Two years earlier, in May 1886, came a claim that 2nd Lt. James Worthington Barrett, an ex-prisoner and passenger on the steamboat, had caused the explosion. Barrett was a veteran of the Mexican–American War and had been captured at the Battle of Franklin. He was injured on &quot;Sultana&quot; and was honorably discharged in May 1865. There is no apparent motive for him to have blown up the boat, especially while on board.

In 1903, another person reported that &quot;Sultana&quot; had been sabotaged by a Tennessee farmer who lived along the river and cut wood for passing steamboats. After a few Union gunboats filled up their bunkers but refused to pay, the farmer supposedly hollowed out a log, filled it with gunpowder, and then left the lethal log on his woodpile. As stated in the 1903 newspaper article, the log was mistakenly taken by &quot;Sultana&quot;. However, &quot;Sultana&quot; was a coal-burning boat and not a wood-burner.

An episode of the PBS series &quot;History Detectives&quot; that aired on July 2, 2014, reviewed the known evidence, thoroughly disputed a theory of sabotage, and then focused on the question of why &quot;Sultana&quot; was allowed to be crowded to several times its normal capacity before departure. The report blamed quartermaster Capt. Reuben Benton Hatch, an individual with a long history of corruption and incompetence, who kept his job through political connections: he was the younger brother of Illinois politician Ozias M. Hatch, an advisor and close friend of President Lincoln. Throughout the war, Captain Hatch had shown incompetence as a quartermaster and competence as a thief, bilking the government out of thousands of dollars. Although brought up on courts-martial charges, Hatch managed to get letters of recommendation from no less reputable personages than President Lincoln and General Ulysses S. Grant. The letters reside in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. After the disaster, Reuben Benton Hatch refused three separate subpoenas to appear before Captain Speed&#x27;s trial and give testimony. He died in 1871, having escaped justice because of his numerous highly placed patrons—including two presidents.

===Lack of accountability===
Despite the magnitude of the disaster, no one was ever formally held accountable. Captain Frederic Speed, a Union officer who sent the 1,950 paroled prisoners into Vicksburg from the parole camp, was charged with grossly overcrowding &quot;Sultana&quot; and found guilty. However, the Judge Advocate General of the United States Army overturned the guilty verdict because Speed had been at the parole camp all day and had not personally placed a single soldier on board &quot;Sultana&quot;. Captain George Augustus Williams, who had placed the men on board, was a regular Army officer, and the military refused to go after one of their own. Captain Hatch, who had concocted a bribe with Captain Mason to crowd as many men onto &quot;Sultana&quot; as possible, had quickly quit the service to avoid a court-martial and then had gone into hiding. Captain Mason of &quot;Sultana&quot;, who was ultimately responsible for dangerously overloading his vessel and ordering the faulty repairs to her leaky boiler, had died in the disaster. In the end, no one was ever held accountable for what remains the deadliest maritime disaster in United States history.

==Legacy==
Monuments and historical markers to &quot;Sultana&quot; and her victims have been erected at Memphis, Tennessee; Muncie, Indiana; Marion, Arkansas; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Cincinnati, Ohio; Knoxville, Tennessee; Hillsdale, Michigan and Mansfield, Ohio.

===Remnants found===
In 1982, a local archaeological expedition, led by Memphis attorney Jerry O. Potter, uncovered what was believed to be the wreckage of &quot;Sultana&quot;. Blackened wooden deck planks and timbers were found about under a soybean field on the Arkansas side, about from Memphis. The Mississippi River has changed course several times since the disaster, leaving the wreck under dry land and far from today&#x27;s river. The main channel now flows about east of its 1865 position.

===Museum===
In 2015, on the 150th anniversary of the disaster, an interim &quot;Sultana&quot; Disaster Museum was opened in Marion, Arkansas, the closest town to the buried remains of the steamboat, across the Mississippi River from Memphis. The museum is only a temporary museum featuring a number of relics from &quot;Sultana&quot; such as shaker plates from the boat&#x27;s furnace, furnace bricks, a few pieces of wood, and some small metal pieces. The museum also features many artifacts from the &quot;Sultana&quot; Survivors&#x27; Association, as well as a model replica of the boat. One wall is decorated with the names of every soldier, crewmember, and passenger on the boat on April 27, 1865. A new state-of-the-art permanent museum, which will be housed in a renovated auditorium/gymnasium is expected to open in September/October 2025.

<text>Zany Golf, also known as Will Harvey&#x27;s Zany Golf, is a fantasy take on miniature golf developed by Sandcastle Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1988. The game was originally written for the Apple II and subsequently ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS compatible operating systems. In 1990, a port was released for the Sega Genesis. The game was developed by Will Harvey, Ian Gooding, Jim Nitchals, and Douglas Fulton. Harvey was pursuing his advanced degrees at Stanford University at the time.

The game is played in a 3D isometric viewpoint and allows up to 4 players. &quot;Zany Golf&quot; consists of half a golf course – nine holes, plus a bonus hole.

==Gameplay==
At the beginning of the first hole, all players are given five strokes. On completing each hole, the remaining players are given more strokes equal to the par of the next hole. Any player who runs out of strokes is eliminated, and the other players are allowed to continue. The game ends when all players are eliminated or when the last hole is completed, and the scorecard is displayed. 

On all versions except the Genesis version, the mouse is used to shoot the ball by clicking on it, pulling back in the reverse direction of the eventual shot, and releasing. On occasion, fairies are placed on the course; hitting them awards anywhere from 1 to 5 bonus strokes. Also, a timer bonus may be possible. If the hole is finished quickly, the player may earn up to four bonus strokes. If a fairy is present or a timer bonus is available, it will be announced prior to the first shot.

Up to four players can play the game by taking turns, with player 1 having a red ball, player 2 a blue ball, player 3 a black ball, and player 4 a white ball. Once a player&#x27;s turn is complete, it disappears from the course and is replaced by an X mark of that player&#x27;s color, which cannot be disrupted by other players&#x27; balls. Multiple players can work together to hit the necessary targets on the Pinball and Energy holes. Once the drop targets or computer buttons have been hit, they need not be hit by any other player.

===Holes===
# Windmill Hole (Par 2): The ball has to be shot into a windmill, or into the slide down the ramp below, to enter the second area. Shooting directly into the windmill awards a 1 stroke bonus.
# Hamburger Hole (Par 3): The hole is covered by a bouncing hamburger, reached by bouncing the ball off a ketchup bottle that squirts. The hamburger bounces up and down when the mouse button is clicked, with more clicks resulting in higher bounces.
# Walls (Par 2): Four walls continuously rise from the ground and fall back down. Hitting them leads down to the bottom part of the course with the hole. The third wall must be hit to get to area with the hole; if missed, the player must shoot up and around into the third area.
# Pinball (Par 3): The level begins as a game of pinball, where the player can hit the ball with the flippers after shooting it. Two drop targets must be hit before the top left corner escape chute is activated. Although enough failures to hit the drop targets will release the ball to the bottom part of the course with the hole, hitting the targets and escape chute leads directly to the hole and activates a 1 stroke bonus.
# Fans (Par 3): Fans positioned along the level allow blowing the ball in a different direction. The fans are activated by moving the mouse left and right rapidly.
# Magic Carpet (Par 2): A special &quot;magic&quot; surface covering most of the level allows direct mouse control over the ball.
# Castle (Par 3): The ball has to be shot up a hill, to enter into a castle or tunnels outside it, to enter the second area with the hole. Entering the castle gate, which is intermittently guarded with a portcullis, awards an additional stroke.
# Ant Hill (Par 3): The course resembles a giant ant hill, with eight slopes facing the eight main compass directions, and holding areas behind each, with the players starting on the south holding area. At the end of all areas except the south, there is a bumper which can be activated with the mouse to hit the ball back to the top of the hill. However, the hole on the hill moves at will while a ball is in play.
# Energy (Par 5): A two-part hole which consists of a giant computer on the lower level and a field of false holes surrounding the real hole on the top level. To complete the level, the player must hit two buttons on the giant computer, then either shoot into a suction tube or use the teleporter pad, both of which lead to the top level. Alternatively, there is a mouse hole on the bottom level which is either empty, shows white eyes, or very rarely shows red eyes if both buttons have been hit. If a ball is shot into the mouse hole while the red eyes are displayed, that player completes the level automatically and the secret level is activated. At any other time, the ball is pushed out of the hole and the shot may be re-attempted. In a multiplayer game, only one player needs to successfully enter the mouse hole. Any other surviving players that use the regular hole are also allowed to proceed to the Mystery Hole.
# Mystery (Par 4): This bonus hole is accessed by either completing the rest of the course under par (26) or by putting into a secret hole on the Energy level with exact timing. This level consists of a &quot;Breakout&quot;-style scenario where the player is given control of a paddle with the mouse, and must hit targets on an inclined slope with the ball, causing them to drop. After all the targets are dropped, corner escape holes are activated which lead to a checkerboard-like putting green (if the hole is hit before the targets are dropped, the ball will shoot back out and all previously hit targets will pop back up). Certain squares on the green flash, which if rolled over at any time (not just while flashing) will teleport the ball back to the start of the green.

==Ports==
Due to the lack of a mouse or similar pointing device, the Sega Genesis edition of the game omitted the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; hole. Instead, the &quot;Mystery&quot; bonus hole from the computer versions is renamed &quot;Knockout Nightmare&quot; and placed after &quot;Ant Hill&quot;.

The DOS version uses a code wheel as a form of copy protection. Before the Hamburger hole, the game gives a prompt which requires the player to rotate the wheel into a certain position. Giving the correct result allows the player to continue the game.

The musical score in the original version uses the 32-voice Ensoniq audio chip in the Apple II computer, incorporating a wide variety of musical instruments and simultaneous sound effects. Ports considerably scale down the music quality and limit or remove sound effects.

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #144 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. &quot;Compute!&quot; described &quot;Zany Golf&quot; as &quot;a moderately challenging game with topnotch graphics and sound&quot;.

<text>Mount Ararat (, ; ) or Mount Ağrı (; ) is a snow-capped and dormant compound volcano in Eastern Turkey. It consists of two major volcanic cones: Greater Ararat and Little Ararat. Greater Ararat is the highest peak in Turkey; Little Ararat&#x27;s elevation is . The Ararat massif is about wide at ground base. The first recorded efforts to reach Ararat&#x27;s summit were made in the Middle Ages, and Friedrich Parrot, Khachatur Abovian, and four others made the first recorded ascent in 1829.

In Europe, the mountain has been called by the name Ararat since the Middle Ages, as it began to be identified with &quot;mountains of Ararat&quot; described in the Bible as the resting-place of Noah&#x27;s Ark, despite contention that does not refer specifically to a Mount Ararat.

Although lying outside the borders of modern Armenia, the mountain is the principal national symbol of Armenia and has been considered a sacred mountain by Armenians. It has featured prominently in Armenian literature and art and is an icon for Armenian irredentism. It is depicted on the coat of arms of Armenia along with Noah&#x27;s Ark.

==Political borders ==
Mount Ararat forms a near-quadripoint between Turkey, Iran, Armenia, and the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan. Its summit is located some west of both the Iranian border and the border of Nakhchivan, and south of the Armenian border. The Turkish-Armenian-Azerbaijani and Turkish-Iranian-Azerbaijani tripoints are some apart, separated by a narrow strip of Turkish territory containing the E99 road which enters Nakhchivan at .

From the 16th century until 1828 the range was part of the Ottoman-Persian border; Great Ararat&#x27;s summit and the northern slopes, along with the eastern slopes of Little Ararat were controlled by Persia. Following the 1826–28 Russo-Persian War and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the Persian controlled territory was ceded to the Russian Empire. Little Ararat became the point where the Turkish, Persian, and Russian imperial frontiers converged. The current international boundaries were formed throughout the 20th century. The mountain came under Turkish control during the 1920 Turkish–Armenian War. It formally became part of Turkey according to the 1921 Treaty of Moscow and Treaty of Kars. In the late 1920s, Turkey crossed the Iranian border and occupied the eastern flank of Lesser Ararat as part of its effort to quash the Kurdish Ararat rebellion, during which the Kurdish rebels used the area as a safe haven against the Turkish state. Iran eventually agreed to cede the area to Turkey in a territorial exchange. The Iran-Turkey boundary skirts east of Lesser Ararat (or Little Ararat), the lower peak of the Ararat massif.

 the mountain was open to climbers only with &quot;military permission&quot;. The procedure to obtain the permission involves submitting a formal request to a Turkish embassy for a special &quot;Ararat visa&quot;, and it is mandatory to hire an official guide from the Turkish Federation for Alpinism.

==Names and etymology==

===Ararat===
&quot;Ararat&quot; (Western Armenian: &quot;Ararad&quot;) is the Biblical Hebrew name ( ) cognate with Assyrian Urartu, of a kingdom that existed in the Armenian Highlands in the 9th–6th centuries BC. The mountain is known as Ararat in European languages, however, none of the native peoples have traditionally referred to the mountain by that name. This mountain was not called by the name Ararat until the Middle Ages; early Armenian historians considered the biblical Ararat to be in Corduene. Ayrarat, the central province of the Greater Armenia, is believed to originate from the same name.

===Ağrı and Agirî===
The Turkish name Mount Ağrı (&quot;Ağrı Dağı&quot;, ; , ), has been known since the late Middle Ages. Although the word &quot;ağrı&quot; literally translates to &quot;pain&quot; the current name is considered a derivative of the mountain&#x27;s initial Turkish name &quot;Ağır Dağ&quot; which translates as &quot;heavy mountain&quot;. The 17th century explorer Evliya Çelebi referred to it as Ağrî in the &quot;Seyahatnâme&quot;. Despite the supposed meaning in Turkish &quot;Ağrı Dağı&quot; as &quot;pain mountain&quot; and Kurdish &quot;Çiyayê Agirî&quot; as &quot;fiery mountain&quot;, some linguists underline a relationship between the mountain&#x27;s name and a village on its slopes called &quot;Ağori&quot; that was decimated after a landslide in 1840. The exact meaning of these related names remains unknown.

The Kurdish name of the mountain is (), which translates to &quot;fiery mountain&quot;. An alternative Kurdish name is &quot;Grîdax&quot;, which is composed of the word &quot;grî&quot;, presumably a corrupted version of the Kurdish &quot;girê&quot;, meaning hill, or &quot;Agirî&quot;, and &quot;dax&quot;, which is the Turkish &quot;dağ&quot;, meaning mountain.

===Masis===
The traditional Armenian name is &quot;Masis&quot; ( ; sometimes &quot;Massis&quot;). However, nowadays, the terms Masis and Ararat are both widely, often interchangeably, used in Armenian. The folk etymology found in Movses Khorenatsi&#x27;s &quot;History of Armenia&quot; derives the name from king Amasya, the great-grandson of the legendary Armenian patriarch Hayk, who is said to have called it after himself.

Various scholarly etymologies have been proposed. Anatoly Novoseltsev suggested that &quot;Masis&quot; derives from Middle Persian &quot;masist&quot;, &quot;the largest&quot;. According to Sargis Petrosyan the &quot;mas&quot; root in Masis means &quot;mountain&quot;, cf. Proto-Indo-European *mņs-. Armen Petrosyan suggested an origin from the Māšu (Mashu) mountain mentioned in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, which sounded like &quot;Māsu&quot; in Assyrian. The name meant &quot;twin&quot;, referring to the twin peaks of the mountain. &quot;Erkuahi&quot;, a land mentioned in Urartian texts and identified with Mt. Ararat, could reflect the native Armenian form of this same name (compare to Armenian &quot;erku&quot; (երկու, &quot;two&quot;)).

Today, both Ararat and Masis are common male first names among Armenians.

===Other names===
The traditional Persian name is (, &quot;&quot;), literally the &quot;mountain of Noah&quot;.

In classical antiquity, particularly in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot;, the peaks of Ararat were known in ancient Greek as (&quot;Abos&quot;) and (&quot;Nibaros&quot;).

==Geography==
Mount Ararat is located in the Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey, between the provinces of Ağrı and Iğdır, near the border with Iran, Armenia and Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan, between the Aras and Murat rivers. The Serdarbulak lava plateau, at 2600 meters of elevation, separates the peaks of Greater and Little Ararat. There are Doğubayazıt Reeds on the western slopes of Mount Ararat. Mount Ararat&#x27;s summit is located some west of the Turkey-Iran border and south of the Turkey-Armenia border. The Ararat plain runs along its northwest to western side.

===Elevation===
Ararat is the third most prominent mountain in West Asia.

An elevation of for Mount Ararat is given by some encyclopedias and reference works such as &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Geographical Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Encyclopedia of World Geography&quot;. However, a number of sources, such as the United States Geological Survey and numerous topographic maps indicate that the alternatively widespread figure of is probably more accurate. The current elevation may be as low as due to the melting of its snow-covered ice cap.

===Summit ice cap===

The ice cap on the summit of Mount Ararat has been shrinking since at least 1957. In the late 1950s, Blumenthal observed that there existed 11 outlet glaciers emerging from a summit snow mass that covered about . At that time, it was found that the present glaciers on the summit of Ararat extend as low as an elevation of on the north-facing slope, and an elevation of 
 on its south-facing slope. Using pre-existing aerial imagery and remote sensing data, Sarıkaya and others studied the extent of the ice cap on Mount Ararat between 1976 and 2011. They discovered that this ice cap had shrunk to by 1976 and to by 2011. They calculated that between 1976 and 2011, the ice cap on top of Mount Ararat had lost 29% of its total area at an average rate of ice loss of per year over 35 years. This rate is consistent with the general rates of retreat of other Turkish summit glaciers and ice caps that have been documented by other studies. According to a 2020 study by Yalcin, &quot;if the glacial withdrawals continue with the same acceleration, the permanent glacier will likely turn into a temporary glacier by 2065.&quot;

Blumenthal estimated that the snow line had been as low as in elevation during the Late Pleistocene. Such a snow line would have created an ice cap of in extent. However, he observed a lack of any clear evidence of prehistoric moraines other than those which were close to the 1958 glacier tongues. Blumenthal explained the absence of such moraines by the lack of confining ridges to control glaciers, insufficient debris load in the ice to form moraines, and their burial by later eruptions. Years later, Birman observed on the south-facing slopes a possible moraine that extends at least in altitude below the base of the 1958 ice cap at an elevation of . He also found two morainal deposits that were created by a Mount Ararat valley glacier of Pleistocene, possibly in the Last Glacial Period, downvalley from Lake Balık. The higher moraine lies at an altitude of about and the lower moraine lies at an altitude of about . The lower moraine occurs about downstream from Lake Balık. Both moraines are about high. It is suspected that Lake Balık occupies a glacial basin.

== Geology ==

Mount Ararat is a polygenic, compound stratovolcano. Covering an area of , it is the largest volcanic edifice within the region. Along its northwest–southeast trending long axis, Mount Ararat is about long and is about long along its short axis. It consists of about of dacitic and rhyolitic pyroclastic debris and dacitic, rhyolitic, and basaltic lavas.

Mount Ararat consists of two distinct volcanic cones, Greater Ararat and Lesser Ararat (Little Ararat). The western volcanic cone, Greater Ararat, is a steep-sided volcanic cone that is larger and higher than the eastern volcanic cone. Greater Ararat is about wide at the base and rises about above the adjacent floors of the Iğdir and Doğubeyazıt basins. The eastern volcanic cone, Lesser Ararat, is high and across. These volcanic cones, which lie apart, are separated by a wide north–south-trending crack. This crack is the surface expression of an extensional fault. Numerous parasitic cones and lava domes have been built by flank eruptions along this fault and on the flanks of both of the main volcanic cones.

Mount Ararat lies within a complex, sinistral pull-apart basin that originally was a single, continuous depression. The growth of Mount Ararat partitioned this depression into two smaller basins, the Iğdir and Doğubeyazıt basins. This pull-apart basin is the result of strike-slip movement along two en-echelon fault segments, the Doğubeyazıt–Gürbulak and Iğdir Faults, of a sinistral strike–slip fault system. Tension between these faults not only formed the original pull-apart basin, but created a system of faults, exhibiting a horsetail splay pattern, that control the position of the principal volcanic eruption centers of Mount Ararat and the associated linear belt of parasitic volcanic cones. The strike-slip fault system within which Mount Ararat is located is the result of north–south convergence and tectonic compression between the Arabian Platform and Laurasia that continued after the Tethys Ocean closed during the Eocene epoch along the Bitlis–Zagros suture.

=== Geological history ===
During the early Eocene and early Miocene, the collision of the Arabian platform with Laurasia closed and eliminated the Tethys Ocean from the area of what is now Anatolia. The closure of these masses of continental crust collapsed this ocean basin by middle Eocene and resulted in a progressive shallowing of the remnant seas, until the end of the early Miocene. Post-collisional tectonic convergence within the collision zone resulted in the total elimination of the remaining seas from East Anatolia at the end of early Miocene, crustal shortening and thickening across the collision zone, and uplift of the East Anatolian–Iranian plateau. Accompanying this uplift was extensive deformation by faulting and folding, which resulted in the creation of numerous local basins. The north–south compressional deformation continues today as evidenced by ongoing faulting, volcanism, and seismicity.

Within Anatolia, regional volcanism started in the middle-late Miocene. During the late Miocene–Pliocene period, widespread volcanism blanketed the entire East Anatolian–Iranian plateau under thick volcanic rocks. This volcanic activity has continued uninterrupted until historical times. Apparently, it reached a climax during the latest Miocene–Pliocene, 6 to 3 Ma. During the Quaternary, the volcanism became restricted to a few local volcanoes such as Mount Ararat. These volcanoes are typically associated with north–south tensional fractures formed by the continuing north–south shortening deformation of Anatolia.

In their detailed study and summary of the Quaternary volcanism of Anatolia, Yilmaz et al. recognized four phases to the construction of Mount Ararat from volcanic rocks exposed in glacial valleys deeply carved into its flanks. First, they recognized a &quot;fissure eruption phase&quot; of Plinian-subPlinian fissure eruptions that deposited more than of pyroclastic rocks and a few basaltic lava flows.

These volcanic rocks were erupted from approximately north northwest–south southeast-trending extensional faults and fissures prior to the development of Mount Ararat. Second, a &quot;cone-building phase&quot; began when the volcanic activity became localized at a point along a fissure. During this phase, the eruption of successive flows of lava up to thick and pyroclastic flows of andesite and dacite composition and later eruption of basaltic lava flows, formed the Greater Ararat cone with a low conical profile. Third, during a &quot;climatic phase&quot;, copious flows of andesitic and basaltic lavas were erupted. During this phase, the current cones of Greater and Lesser Ararat were formed as eruptions along subsidiary fissures and cracks and flank occurred. Finally, the volcanic eruptions at Mount Ararat transitioned into a &quot;flank eruption phase&quot;, during which a major north–south-trending fault offset the two cones that developed along with a number of subsidiary fissures and cracks on the volcano&#x27;s flanks.

Along this fault and the subsidiary fissures and cracks, a number of parasitic cones and domes were built by minor eruptions. One subsidiary cone erupted voluminous basalt and andesite lava flows. They flowed across the Doğubeyazıt plain and along the southerly flowing Sarısu River. These lava flows formed black ʻaʻā and pāhoehoe lava flows that contain well preserved lava tubes. The radiometric dating of these lava flows yielded radiometric ages of 0.4, 0.48 and 0.81 Ma. Overall, radiometric ages obtained from the volcanic rocks erupted by Mount Ararat range from 1.5 to 0.02 Ma.

===Recent volcanic and seismic activity===
The chronology of Holocene volcanic activity associated with Mount Ararat is documented by either archaeological excavations, oral history, historical records, or a combination of these data, which provide evidence that volcanic eruptions of Mount Ararat occurred in 2500–2400 BC, 550 BC, possibly in 1450 AD and 1783 AD, and definitely in 1840 AD. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that explosive eruptions and pyroclastic flows from the northwest flank of Mount Ararat destroyed and buried at least one Kura–Araxes culture settlement and caused numerous fatalities in 2500–2400 BC. Oral histories indicated that a significant eruption of uncertain magnitude occurred in 550 BC and minor eruptions of uncertain nature might have occurred in 1450 AD and 1783 AD. According to the interpretation of historical and archaeological data, strong earthquakes not associated with volcanic eruptions also occurred in the area of Mount Ararat in 139, 368, 851–893, and 1319 AD. During the 139 AD earthquake, a large landslide that caused many casualties and was similar to the 1840 AD landslide originated from the summit of Mount Ararat.

====1840 eruption====
A phreatic eruption occurred on Mount Ararat on July 2, 1840 and pyroclastic flow from radial fissures on the upper north flank of the mountain and a possibly associated earthquake of magnitude 7.4 that caused severe damage and numerous casualties. Up to 10,000 people died in the earthquake, including 1,900 villagers in the village of Akhuri (Armenian: Akori, modern Yenidoğan) who were killed by a gigantic landslide and subsequent debris flow. In addition, this combination of landslide and debris flow destroyed the Armenian monastery of St. Jacob near Akori, the town of Aralik, several villages, and Russian military barracks. It also temporarily dammed the Sevjur (Metsamor) River.

==Ascents==
The 13th century missionary William of Rubruck wrote that &quot;Many have tried to climb it, but none has been able.&quot;

===Religious objections===
The Armenian Apostolic Church was historically opposed to ascents of Ararat on religious grounds. Thomas Stackhouse, an 18th-century English theologian, noted that &quot;All the Armenians are firmly persuaded that Noah&#x27;s ark exists to the present day on the summit of Mount Ararat, and that in order to preserve it, no person is permitted to approach it.&quot; In response to its first ascent by Parrot and Abovian, one high-ranking Armenian Apostolic Church clergyman commented that to climb the sacred mountain was &quot;to tie the womb of the mother of all mankind in a dragonish mode&quot;. By contrast, in the 21st century to climb Ararat is &quot;the most highly valued goal of some of the patriotic pilgrimages that are organized in growing number from Armenia and the Armenian diaspora&quot;.

===First ascent===
The first recorded ascent of the mountain in modern times took place on . The Baltic German naturalist Friedrich Parrot of the University of Dorpat arrived at Etchmiadzin in mid-September 1829, almost two years after the Russian capture of Yerevan, for the sole purpose of exploring Ararat. The prominent Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian, then a deacon and translator at Etchmiadzin, was assigned by Catholicos Yeprem, the head of the Armenian Church, as interpreter and guide.

Parrot and Abovian crossed the Aras River into the district of Surmali and headed to the Armenian village of Akhuri on the northern slope of Ararat, above sea level. They set up a base camp at the Armenian monastery of St. Hakob some higher, at an elevation of . After two failed attempts, they reached the summit on their third attempt at 3:15 p.m. on October 9, 1829. The group included Parrot, Abovian, two Russian soldiers – Aleksei Zdorovenko and Matvei Chalpanov – and two Armenian Akhuri villagers – Hovhannes Aivazian and Murad Poghosian. Parrot measured the elevation at using a mercury barometer. This was not only the first recorded ascent of Ararat, but also the second highest elevation climbed by man up to that date outside of Mount Licancabur in the Chilean Andes. Abovian dug a hole in the ice and erected a wooden cross facing north. Abovian also picked up a chunk of ice from the summit and carried it down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On , Parrot and Abovian together with the Akhuri hunter Sahak&#x27;s brother Hako, acting as a guide, climbed up Lesser Ararat.

===Later notable ascents===
Other early notable climbers of Ararat included Russian climatologist and meteorologist Kozma Spassky-Avtonomov (August 1834), Karl Behrens (1835), German mineralogist and geologist Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich (29 July 1845), British politician Henry Danby Seymour (1848) and British army officer Major Robert Stuart (1856). Later in the 19th century, two British politicians and scholars—James Bryce (1876) and H. F. B. Lynch (1893)—climbed the mountain. The first winter climb was by Turkish alpinist Bozkurt Ergör, the former president of the Turkish Mountaineering Federation, who climbed the peak on 21 February 1970.

==Resting-place of Noah&#x27;s Ark==
===Origin of the tradition===
According to the Book of Genesis of the Old Testament, Noah&#x27;s Ark landed on the &quot;mountains of Ararat&quot; (). Historians and Bible scholars generally agree that &quot;Ararat&quot; is the Hebrew name of Urartu, the geographical predecessor of Armenia; they argue that the word referred to the wider region at the time and not specifically to Mount Ararat. The phrase is translated as &quot;mountains of Armenia&quot; (&quot;montes Armeniae&quot;) in the Vulgate. Nevertheless, Ararat is traditionally considered the resting-place of Noah&#x27;s Ark, and, thus, regarded as a biblical mountain.

Mount Ararat has been associated with the Genesis account since the 11th century, and Armenians began to identify it as the ark&#x27;s landing place during that time. F. C. Conybeare wrote that the mountain was &quot;a center and focus of pagan myths and cults… and it was only in the eleventh century, after these had vanished from the popular mind, that the Armenian theologians ventured to locate on its eternal snows the resting-place of Noah&#x27;s ark&quot;. William of Rubruck is usually considered the earliest reference for the tradition of Mount Ararat as the landing place of the ark in European literature. John Mandeville is another early author who mentioned Mount Ararat, &quot;where Noah&#x27;s ship rested, and it is still there&quot;.

The ark on Ararat was often depicted in &quot;mappae mundi&quot; as early as the 11th century.

===Prevalence of the tradition===
Most Christians, including most of Western Christianity, identify Mount Ararat with the biblical mountains of Ararat &quot;largely because it would have been the first peak to emerge from the receding flood waters&quot;. H. G. O. Dwight wrote in 1856 that it is &quot;the general opinion of the learned in Europe&quot; that the Ark landed on Ararat. James Bryce wrote that the ark rested upon a &quot;mountain in the district which the Hebrews knew as Ararat, or Armenia&quot; in an 1878 article for the Royal Geographical Society, and he added that the biblical writer must have had Mount Ararat in mind because it is so &quot;very much higher, more conspicuous, and more majestic than any other summit in Armenia&quot;.

In 2001 Pope John Paul II declared in his homily in Yerevan&#x27;s St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral: &quot;We are close to Mount Ararat, where tradition says that the Ark of Noah came to rest.&quot; Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, also mentioned it as the resting-place of Noah&#x27;s Ark in his speech at Etchmiadzin Cathedral in 2010.

Those critical of this claim point out that Ararat was the name of the country at the time when Genesis was written, not specifically the mountain. Arnold wrote in his 2008 Genesis commentary, &quot;The location &#x27;on the mountains&#x27; of Ararat indicates not a specific mountain by that name, but rather the mountainous region of the land of Ararat&quot;.

===Searches===
Ararat has traditionally been the main focus of the searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark. Augustin Calmet wrote in his 1722 biblical dictionary: &quot;It is affirmed, but without proof, that there are still remains of Noah&#x27;s ark on the top of this mountain; but M. de Tournefort, who visited this spot, has assured us there was nothing like it; that the top of mount Ararat is inaccessible, both by reason of its great height, and of the snow which perpetually covers it.&quot; Archaeological expeditions, sometimes supported by evangelical and millenarian churches, have been conducted since the 19th century in search of the ark. According to a 1974 book, around 200 people from more than 20 countries claimed to have seen the Ark on Ararat since 1856. A fragment from the ark supposedly found on Ararat is on display at the museum of Etchmiadzin Cathedral, the center of the Armenian Church. Despite numerous reports of ark sightings (e.g. Ararat anomaly) and rumors, &quot;no scientific evidence of the ark has emerged&quot;.
Searches for Noah&#x27;s Ark are considered by scholars an example of pseudoarchaeology. Kenneth Feder writes: &quot;As the flood story itself is unsupported by any archaeological evidence, it is not surprising that there is no archaeological evidence for the existence of an impossibly large boat dating to 5,000 years ago.&quot;

==Significance for Armenians==
===Symbolism===


Despite lying outside the borders of modern Armenia, Ararat has historically been associated with Armenia, and Armenians have been called the &quot;people of Ararat&quot;. It is widely considered the country&#x27;s principal national symbol. The image of Ararat, usually framed within a nationalizing discourse, is ubiquitous in everyday material culture in Armenia. Tsypylma Darieva argues that Armenians have &quot;a sense of possession of Ararat in the sense of symbolic cultural property&quot;.

There is historical and modern mountain worship around it among Armenians. Ararat is known as the &quot;holy mountain&quot; of the Armenian people. It was principal to the pre-Christian Armenian mythology, where it was the home of the gods. With the rise of Christianity, the mythology associated with pagan worship of the mountain was lost.

Ararat was the geographical center of ancient Armenia. In the 19th-century era of romantic nationalism, when an Armenian state did not exist, Ararat symbolized the historical Armenian nation-state. In 1861 Armenian poet Mikael Nalbandian, witnessing the Italian unification, wrote to Harutiun Svadjian in a letter from Naples: &quot;Etna and Vesuvius are still smoking; is there no fire left in the old volcano of Ararat?&quot;

Theodore Edward Dowling wrote in 1910 that Ararat and Etchmiadzin are the &quot;two great objects of Armenian veneration&quot;. He noted that the &quot;noble snowy mountain takes the place, in the estimation of the Armenians, that Mount Sinai and the traditional Mount Zion do among the adherents of other Eastern Christians&quot;. Jonathan Smele called Ararat and the medieval capital of Ani the &quot;most cherished symbols of Armenian identity&quot;.

===Myth of origin===
The Genesis flood narrative was linked to the Armenian myth of origin by the early medieval historian Movses Khorenatsi. In his &quot;History of Armenia&quot;, he wrote that Noah and his family first settled in Armenia and later moved to Babylon. Hayk, a descendant of Japheth, a son of Noah, revolted against Bel (the biblical Nimrod) and returned to the area around Mount Ararat, where he established the roots of the Armenian nation. He is thus considered the legendary founding father (patriarch) and the name giver of the Armenian people. According to Razmik Panossian, this legend &quot;makes Armenia the cradle of all civilisation since Noah&#x27;s Ark landed on the &#x27;Armenian&#x27; mountain of Ararat. [...] it connects Armenians to the biblical narrative of human development. [...] it makes Mount Ararat the national symbol of all Armenians, and the territory around it the Armenian homeland from time immemorial.&quot;

===Coat of arms of Armenia===
Mount Ararat has been depicted on the coat of arms of Armenia consistently since 1918. The First Republic&#x27;s coat of arms was designed by architect Alexander Tamanian and painter Hakob Kojoyan. This coat of arms was readopted by the legislature of the Republic of Armenia on April 19, 1992, after Armenia regained its independence. Mount Ararat is depicted along with the ark on its peak on the shield on an orange background. The emblem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (Soviet Armenia) was created by the painters Martiros Saryan and Hakob Kojoyan in 1921. Mount Ararat is depicted in the center and makes up a large portion of it.

It is also depicted on the emblem and flag of Yerevan since 2004. It is portrayed on the breast of a lion along with the Armenian eternity sign. The mountain appears on the emblem of the Armenian Catholic Ordinariate of Armenia and Eastern Europe.

Ararat appeared on the coat of arms of the Armenian Oblast and the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate (image), subdivisions of the Russian Empire that included the northern flanks of the mountain. They were adopted in 1833 and 1843, respectively.

===Symbol of genocide and territorial claims===
In the aftermath of the Armenian genocide of 1915, Ararat came to represent the destruction of the native Armenian population of eastern Turkey (Western Armenia) in the national consciousness of Armenians. Ari L. Goldman noted in 1988: &quot;In most Armenian homes in the modern diaspora, there are pictures of Mount Ararat, a bittersweet reminder of the homeland and national aspirations.&quot;

Ararat has become a symbol of Armenian efforts to reclaim its &quot;lost lands&quot;, i.e. the areas west of Ararat that are now part of Turkey that had significant Armenian populations before the genocide. Adriaans noted that Ararat is featured as a sanctified territory for the Armenians in everyday banal irredentism. Stephanie Platz wrote: &quot;Omnipresent, the vision of Ararat rising above Yerevan and its outskirts constantly reminds Armenians of their putative ethnogenesis … and of their exile from Eastern Anatolia after the Armenian genocide of 1915.&quot;

Turkish political scientist Bayram Balci argues that regular references to the Armenian Genocide and Mount Ararat &quot;clearly indicate&quot; that the border with Turkey is contested in Armenia. Since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the Armenian government has not made official claims to any Turkish territory, however the Armenian government has avoided &quot;an explicit and formal recognition of the existing Turkish-Armenian border&quot;. In a 2010 interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan was asked whether Armenia wants &quot;Mount Ararat back&quot;. Sargsyan, in response, said that &quot;No one can take Mount Ararat from us; we keep it in our hearts. Wherever Armenians live in the world today, you will find a picture of Mount Ararat in their homes. And I feel certain that a time will come when Mount Ararat is no longer a symbol of the separation between our peoples, but an emblem of understanding. But let me make this clear: Never has a representative of Armenia made territorial demands. Turkey alleges this—perhaps out of its own bad conscience?&quot;

The most prominent party to lay claims to eastern Turkey is the nationalist Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun). which claims it as part of what it considers United Armenia. In various settings, several notable individuals such as German historian Tessa Hofmann, Slovak conservative politician František Mikloško, Lithuanian political scientist and Soviet dissident Aleksandras Štromas have spoken in support of Armenian claims over Mt. Ararat.

==Cultural depictions==

Levon Abrahamian noted that Ararat is visually present for Armenians in reality (it can be seen from many houses in Yerevan and settlements in the Ararat plain), symbolically (through many visual representations, such as on Armenia&#x27;s coats of arms), and culturally—in numerous and various nostalgic poetical, political, architectural representation. The first three postage stamps issued by Armenia in 1992 after achieving independence from the Soviet Union depicted Mount Ararat.

Mount Ararat has been depicted on various Armenian dram banknotes issued in 1993–2001; on the reverse of the 10 dram banknotes issued in 1993, on the reverse of the 50 dram banknotes issued in 1998, on the obverse of the 100 and 500 dram banknotes issued in 1993, and on the reverse of the 50,000 dram banknotes issued in 2001. It was also depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 100 lira banknotes of 1972–1986.

Ararat is depicted on the logo of two of Armenia&#x27;s leading university, the Yerevan State University, on the logos of Football Club Ararat Yerevan (since the Soviet times) and the Football Federation of Armenia. The logo of Armavia, Armenia&#x27;s now defunct flag carrier, also depicted Ararat.

&quot;Ararat&quot; (now &quot;Etchmiadzin&quot;) was the name of the Armenian Church&#x27;s official magazine, the first periodical in Armenia, launched in 1868. The publications of the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party in Lebanon (&quot;Ararad&quot; daily) and California, U.S. (&quot;Massis&quot; weekly) are both named for the mountain.

The Ararat brandy, produced by the Yerevan Brandy Company since 1887, is considered the most prestigious Eastern European brandy. Hotels in Yerevan often advertise the visibility of Ararat from their rooms, which is seen as a major advantage for tourists.

===In visual art===
;Armenian
According to a 1963 source, the first Armenian artist to depict the mountain was Ivan Aivazovsky, who created a painting of Ararat during his visit to Armenia in 1868. However, a late 17th century map by Eremia Chelebi, an Ottoman Armenian, depicting Ararat was later discovered. Other major Armenians artists who painted Ararat include Yeghishe Tadevosyan, Gevorg Bashinjaghian, Martiros Saryan, and Panos Terlemezian.

Ararat was depicted by non-Armenians, often in the books of European travelers in the 18th–19th centuries who visited Armenia. 
===In literature===
Rouben Paul Adalian suggested that &quot;there is probably more poetry written about Mount Ararat than any other mountain on earth&quot;. Travel writer Rick Antonson described Ararat as the &quot;most fabled mountain in the world&quot;.

====Armenian====

Mount Ararat is featured prominently in Armenian literature. According to Meliné Karakashian, Armenian poets &quot;attribute to it symbolic meanings of unity, freedom, and independence&quot;. According to Kevork Bardakjian, in Armenian literature, Ararat &quot;epitomizes Armenia and Armenian suffering and aspirations, especially the consequences of the 1915 genocide: almost total annihilation, loss of a unique culture and land [...] and an implicit determination never to recognize the new political borders&quot;.

The last two lines of Yeghishe Charents&#x27;s 1920 poem &quot;I Love My Armenia&quot; (Ես իմ անուշ Հայաստանի) read: &quot;And in the entire world you will not find a mountaintop like Ararat&#x27;s. / Like an unreachable peak of glory I love my Mount Masis.&quot; In a 1926 poem dedicated to the mountain Avetik Isahakyan wrote: &quot;Ages as though in second came, / Touched the grey crest of Ararat, / And passed by...! [...] It&#x27;s now your turn; you too, now, / Stare at its high and lordly brow, / And pass by...!&quot;

Ararat is the most frequently cited symbol in the poetry of Hovhannes Shiraz. In collection of poems, &quot;Knar Hayastani&quot; (Lyre of Armenia) published in 1958, there are many poems &quot;with very strong nationalist overtones, especially with respect to Mount Ararat (in Turkey) and the irredentism it entailed&quot;. In one such poem, &quot;Ktak&quot; (Bequest), Shiraz bequeaths his son Mt. Ararat to &quot;keep it forever, / As the language of us Armenians, as the pillar of your father&#x27;s home&quot;. A group of four Armenians buried Shiraz&#x27;s heart at the summit of Ararat in 2006.

The first lines of Paruyr Sevak&#x27;s 1961 poem &quot;We Are Few...&quot; (Քիչ ենք, բայց հայ ենք) read: &quot;We are few, but they say of us we are Armenians. / We do not think ourselves superior to anyone. / Clearly we shall have to accept / That we, and only we, have an Ararat&quot;. In one short poem Silva Kaputikyan compares Armenia to an &quot;ancient rock-carved fortress&quot;, the towers of which are Ararat and Aragats.

====Non-Armenian====
English Romantic poet William Wordsworth imagines seeing the ark in the poem &quot;Sky-prospect — From the Plain of France&quot;.

In his &quot;Journey to Arzrum&quot; (Путешествие в Арзрум; 1835–36), the celebrated Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin recounted his travels to the Caucasus and Armenia at the time of the 1828–29 Russo-Turkish War.
Russian Symbolist poet Valery Bryusov often referred to Ararat in his poetry and dedicated two poems to the mountain, which were published in 1917. Bryusov saw Ararat as the embodiment of antiquity of the Armenian people and their culture.

Russian poet Osip Mandelstam wrote fondly of Ararat during his 1933 travels in Armenia. &quot;I have cultivated in myself a sixth sense, an &#x27;Ararat&#x27; sense&quot;, the poet wrote, &quot;the sense of an attraction to a mountain.&quot;

During his travels to Armenia, Soviet Russian writer Vasily Grossman observed Mount Ararat from Yerevan standing &quot;high in the blue sky&quot;. He wrote that &quot;with its gentle, tender contours, it seems to grow not out of the earth but out of the sky, as if it has condensed from its white clouds and its deep blue. It is this snowy mountain, this bluish-white sunlit mountain that shone in the eyes of those who wrote the Bible.&quot;

In &quot;The Maximus Poems&quot; (1953) American poet Charles Olson, who grew up near the Armenian neighborhood in Worcester, Massachusetts, compares the Ararat Hill near his childhood home to the mountain and &quot;imagines he can capture an Armenian&#x27;s immigrant perspective: the view of Ararat Hill as Mount Ararat&quot;.

The world renowned Turkish-Kurdish writer Yaşar Kemal&#x27;s 1970 book entitled &quot;Ağrı Dağı Efsanesi&quot; (&quot;The Legend of Mount Ararat&quot;) is about a local myth about a poor boy and the governor&#x27;s daughter. There is also an opera (1971) and a film (1975) based on that novel.

In the 1984 science fiction novel &quot;Orion&quot; by Ben Bova, part three entitled “Flood” is set at an unspecified valley at the foot of Mount Ararat. The antagonist, Ahriman, floods the valley by melting the snow caps of the mountain in a bid to stop the invention of agriculture by a band of Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers.

Several major episodes in &quot;Declare&quot; (2001) by Tim Powers take place on Mount Ararat. In the book, it is the focal point of supernatural happenings.

==Places named for Ararat==
;In Armenia
*In Armenia, four settlements are named after the mountain&#x27;s two names: Ararat and Masis. All are located in the Ararat Plain. First, the village of Davalu was renamed Ararat in 1935, followed by Tokhanshalu being renamed Masis in 1945, and the workers town of Davalu&#x27;s nearby cement factory also being renamed Ararat in 1947 (granted a city status in 1962). The railway town of Ulukhanlu was renamed Masis in 1950, while the former village/town of Ulukhanlu, renamed Hrazdan and then Masis in 1969. The two merged to form the urban-type settlement of Masis, the current town, in 1971.
*In the Soviet and early post-Soviet period there were administrative divisions (&quot;shrjan&quot; or &quot;raion&quot;) called Ararat (Vedi until 1968) and Masis, formed in 1930 and 1968, respectively. They became a part of the province (&quot;marz&quot;) of Ararat in the 1995.
*The name is also used in two dioceses of the Armenian Apostolic Church: the Araratian Pontifical Diocese and the Diocese of Masyatsotn, encompassing capital Yerevan and the Ararat province, respectively.

;Elsewhere
*The Turkish province of Ağrı was named after the Turkish name of the mountain in 1927, while the provincial capital city of Karaköse was renamed to Ağrı in 1946.
*In the United States, a river in Virginia and North Carolina was named Ararat after the mountain no later than 1770. An unincorporated community in North Carolina was later named after the river. A township (formed in 1852) and a mountain in Pennsylvania are called Ararat.
*In the Australian state of Victoria, a city was named Ararat in 1840. Its local government area is also called Ararat.
*96205 Ararat is an asteroid named in the mountain&#x27;s honor. It was discovered in 1992 by Freimut Börngen and Lutz D. Schmadel at Tautenburg Observatory in Germany. The name was proposed by Börngen.

===States===
*Besides Ararat being the Hebrew version of Urartu, this Iron Age state is often referred to as the &quot;Araratian Kingdom&quot; or the &quot;Kingdom of Ararat&quot; (, &quot;Arartyan t&#x27;agavorut&#x27;yun&quot;) in Armenian historiography. Levon Abrahamian argues that this name gives it a &quot;biblical and an Armenian touch.&quot;
*The First Republic of Armenia, the first modern Armenian state that existed between 1918 and 1920, was sometimes called the Araratian Republic or the Republic of Ararat (, &quot;Araratyan hanrapetut&#x27;yun&quot;) as it was centered in the Ararat plain.
*In 1927 the Kurdish nationalist party Xoybûn led by Ihsan Nuri, fighting an uprising against the Turkish government, declared the independence of the Republic of Ararat (), centered around Mount Ararat.

<doc id="313873" wikidata="Q3576040" url="?curid=313873" title="Zool 2">
<text>Zool 2 is a side-scrolling platform video game originally developed by The Warp Factory and published by Gremlin Graphics for the Amiga in November 1993. It is the sequel to the original &quot;Zool&quot;, which was released earlier in 1992 on various platforms.

When the forces of Krool are wreaking havoc upon the Nth Dimension with the help from his henchman Mental Block, the intergalactic gremlin ninja Zool alongside his female companion Zooz and their two-headed dog Zoon, are entrusted with the task of stopping Mental Block and restore order to the dimension. Originally released for the Amiga microcomputers, &quot;Zool 2&quot; was later ported to the Amiga CD32, MS-DOS, and Atari Jaguar platforms, with the latter being published by Atari Corporation in North America and Europe, in addition to being published in Japan by Mumin Corporation on April 21, 1995.

When it was originally released for the Amiga, &quot;Zool 2&quot; received positive reception from critics who praised the graphics, sound department and gameplay, with some considering it as an improvement over the first game. Other ports of the game received similarly positive reception from reviewers, while the Jaguar version received mixed reviews from critics since its release and has sold nearly 11,000 copies as of April 1, 1995, though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Zool 2&quot; is a side-scrolling platform game that plays similarly to its predecessor, &quot;Zool&quot;. Both Zool and his female counterpart, Zooz, almost share the same move set between each other but there are some subtle differences with the two characters in terms of their abilities and means of defense. Whereas Zool attacks with projectiles, Zooz is armed with an energy whip for close quarters combat, along with the ability of shooting projectiles as well. In addition, each character is capable of destroying certain parts of the scenery that the other one could not, and vice versa, resulting in a slightly different route through the levels. As with the original game, the sequel features several minigames, such as a version of &quot;Breakout&quot; which involves using Zoon, the two-headed morphing pet dog of Zool and Zooz, as a paddle in order to keep the ball in play by bouncing it upwards. The progression system acts similarly to the original game, which involves the player in collecting a set number of items in order to advance into the next level. The game also features a two-player mode.

== Plot ==
&quot;Zool 2&quot; takes place several months after the events occurred in &quot;Zool&quot;. Krool, the main antagonist of the original game has sent his forces and Mental Block, his shapeshifting henchman to invade the Nth dimension and seize power in order to stifle the imagination of the world, causing rampant boredom in the process. Zool, the main protagonist of the first game, alongside his companion Zooz and their two-headed mascot Zoon, are entrusted with the mission of restoring order to the dimension and defeat Mental Block. After traversing through multiple locations, the trio reaches the main area where Mental Block resides and they defeat him, saving the dimension as a result, with a hint at a possible further sequel.

== Development and release ==

&quot;Zool 2&quot; was created by a new development team at The Warp Factory, whose programming staff involved personnel that previously worked on &quot;Harlequin&quot; for Gremlin Graphics, with only composer Patrick Phelan returning from the original &quot;Zool&quot; crew as George Allan, Adrian Carless and Tony Dawson did not return to work on the sequel. Gremlin marketing manager Nick Clarkson stated that they wanted to expand upon &quot;Zool&quot;″s character and gameplay for the sequel, while producer Peter J. Cook claimed that the team at The Warp Factory wanted to stay with a basic theme following the same gameplay style but move towards a new direction via new ideas with larger levels to explore. The team also reworked Zool&#x27;s look for the sequel, while his female companion Zooz went through various changes before release.

The Amiga remained the lead format for the second &quot;Zool&quot; game, but unlike the first it was not widely ported to the other platforms, only the Atari Jaguar and DOS. The game had originally been planned to be bundled with the Amiga CD32 at the request of Commodore, but when Gremlin Graphics failed to reach the deadline, &quot;Zool 2&quot; was bundled with the Amiga 1200&#x27;s Computer Combat pack in 1994. The PC version of the game was also re-released as part of the Windows-based compilation CD &quot;Best of Gremlin&quot; in 2000. The Jaguar version of &quot;Zool 2&quot; was developed by Imagitec Design and was first showcased to the public at SCES &#x27;94 in a playable state.

== Reception ==
The Amiga versions of &quot;Zool 2&quot; received generally high review scores, including 93% in &quot;Amiga Format&quot;, 90% in &quot;Amiga Computing&quot;, 86% in &quot;Amiga Power&quot; and 76% in &quot;CU Amiga&quot;.

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the Jaguar version a positive review, saying that the varied abilities of the playable characters &quot;push this game to the top of the Jaguar hop-n-bop ranks&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; also praised the graphics, stating that &quot;&quot;Zool&quot;″s Nth Dimension is a shiny, inventive world that&#x27;s equal parts candy shop and toy store&quot;, and that the Jaguar version is sharper and brighter than previous versions of the game. &quot;Next Generation&quot; called it &quot;still a basic platform game, but one of the best we&#x27;ve seen a while&quot;. Like &quot;GamePro&quot;, they praised the quality of the graphics, and additionally the large number of interesting power-ups and stages. Mike Weigand of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; assessed it as &quot;a pretty good version of the pint-sized ninja character&quot;, particularly noting the large levels, though he felt the graphics were sometimes &quot;visual overkill&quot;.

<text>Männedorf (High Alemannic: &quot;Mänidoorf&quot;) is a municipality in the district of Meilen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.

==History==

Like in all other villages along the lake of Zürich, archeological findings indicate settlements in the stone ages. The original settlement dates from the 7th or 8th century; the name &quot;Mannidorf&quot; (&quot;Village of Manno&quot;, a personal name, possibly of a nobleman) is mentioned in 933. The upright otter on a golden background in the coats of arm is derived from that of the medieval provost Eberhard Ottikon.

The village originally housed fishermen, farmers and winegrowers. Männedorf was once owned by the monastery of Pfäfers. It later developed to become the home of the bailiwick of Zürich from 1405 until 1798. After the opening of the Lake Zurich right bank railway from Zürich to Rapperswil in 1894 the village blossomed. Many businesses of handicraft, trade and industry were established. Most notably probably a tannery, organ-building and precision mechanics. There was also a mill, a smithy, a public bath and a growing number of guesthouses.

<text>The Bataan Death March was the forcible transfer by the Imperial Japanese Army of around 72,000 to 78,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war (POW) from the municipalities of Bagac and Mariveles on the Bataan Peninsula to Camp O&#x27;Donnell via San Fernando.

The transfer began on April 9, 1942, after the three-month Battle of Bataan in the Philippines during World War II. The total distance marched from Mariveles to San Fernando and from the Capas Train Station to various camps was . Sources also report widely differing prisoner of war casualties prior to reaching Camp O&#x27;Donnell: from 5,000 to 18,000 Filipino deaths and 500 to 650 American deaths during the march.

The march was characterized by severe physical abuse and wanton killings. POWs who fell or were caught on the ground were shot. After the war, the Japanese commander, General Masaharu Homma and two of his officers, Major General Yoshitaka Kawane and Colonel Kurataro Hirano, were tried by United States military commissions for war crimes and sentenced to death on charges of failing to prevent their subordinates from committing atrocities. Homma was executed in 1946, and Kawane and Hirano in 1949.

==Background==
===Prelude===
When General Douglas MacArthur returned to active duty, the latest revision of plans for the defense of the Philippine Islands—War Plan Orange 3 (WPO-3)—was politically unrealistic, as it assumed a conflict only involving the United States and Japan, not the combined Axis powers. However, the plan was tactically sound, and its provisions for defense were applicable under any local situation.

Under WPO-3, the mission of the Philippine garrison was to hold the entrance to Manila Bay and deny its use to Japanese naval forces. If the enemy prevailed, the Americans were to hold back the Japanese advance while withdrawing to the Bataan Peninsula, which was recognized as the key to the control of Manila Bay. It was to be defended to the &quot;last extremity&quot;. MacArthur assumed command of the Allied army in July 1941 and rejected WPO-3 as defeatist, preferring a more aggressive course of action. He recommended—among other things—a coastal defense strategy that would include the entire archipelago. His recommendations were followed in the plan that was eventually approved.

The main force of General Masaharu Homma&#x27;s 14th Army came ashore at Lingayen Gulf on the morning of December 22, 1941. The defenders failed to hold the beaches. By the end of the day, the Japanese had secured most of their objectives and were in position to emerge onto the central plain. Late in the afternoon of 23 December General Jonathan Wainwright telephoned MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters in Manila and informed him that any further defense of the Lingayen beaches was &quot;impracticable&quot;. He requested and was given permission to withdraw behind the Agno River. MacArthur decided to abandon his own plan for defense and revert to WPO-3, evacuating President Manuel L. Quezon, High Commissioner Francis B. Sayre, their families, and his own headquarters to Corregidor on December 24. A rear echelon, headed by the deputy chief of staff, Brigadier General Richard J. Marshall, remained behind in Manila to close out the headquarters and to supervise the shipment of supplies and the evacuation of the remaining troops.

On December 26, Manila was officially declared an open city, and MacArthur&#x27;s proclamation was published in the newspapers and broadcast over the radio.

The Battle of Bataan began on January 7, 1942, and continued until April 9 when the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) commander, Major General Edward P. King, surrendered to Colonel Mootoo Nakayama of the 14th Army. King went against his superior&#x27;s orders and told his troops to lay down their arms, accepting personal responsibility for the surrender. He made the following statement: &quot;You men remember this. You did not surrender … you had no alternative but to obey my order.&quot;

===Allied surrender===
Homma and his staff encountered almost twice as many captives as his reports had estimated, creating an enormous logistical challenge: the transport and movement of over 60,000 starved, sick, wounded and debilitated prisoners and over 38,000 equally weakened civilian noncombatants who had been caught up in the battle. He wanted to move the prisoners and refugees to the north to get them out of the way of Homma&#x27;s final assault on Corregidor, but there was simply not enough mechanized transport for the wounded, sick, and weakened masses.

==Forced March==

Following the surrender of Bataan on 9 April 1942 to the Imperial Japanese Army, prisoners were amassed in the towns of Mariveles and Bagac. They were ordered to turn over their possessions. American Lieutenant Kermit Lay recounted how this was done:

Word quickly spread among the prisoners to conceal or destroy any Japanese money or mementos, as their captors would assume it had been stolen from dead Japanese soldiers.:37 American soldier Bert Bank recalls:

Prisoners started out from Mariveles on April 10 and from Bagac on April 11, converging in Pilar and heading north to the San Fernando railhead. The prisoners were put in groups of 100 men each, with four Japanese guards per group. At the beginning, there were rare instances of kindness by Japanese officers and those Japanese soldiers who spoke English, such as the sharing of food and cigarettes and permitting personal possessions to be kept. One prisoner who&#x27;d been a star football player at Notre Dame had his class ring taken by a guard. It was later returned by a Japanese officer who attended Notre Dame rival USC, had seen him play and had admired his athletic skills. This, however, was quickly followed by unrelenting brutality, theft, and even knocking men&#x27;s teeth out for gold fillings, as the common Japanese soldier had also suffered in the battle for Bataan and had nothing but disgust and hatred for his &quot;captives&quot; (Japan did not recognize these people as POWs). The first atrocity—attributed to Colonel Masanobu Tsuji—occurred when approximately 350 to 400 Filipino officers and non-commissioned officers under his supervision were summarily executed in the Pantingan River massacre after they had surrendered. Tsuji—acting against General Homma&#x27;s wishes that the prisoners be transferred peacefully—had issued clandestine orders to Japanese officers to summarily execute all American &quot;captives&quot;. Although some Japanese officers ignored the orders, others were receptive to the idea of murdering POWs.

During the march, prisoners received little food or water, and many died. They were subjected to severe physical abuse, including beatings and torture. On the march, the &quot;sun treatment&quot; was a common form of torture. Prisoners were forced to sit in sweltering direct sunlight without helmets or other head coverings. Anyone who asked for water was shot dead. Some men were told to strip naked or sit within sight of fresh, cool water.:40 Trucks drove over some of those who fell or succumbed to fatigue, and &quot;cleanup crews&quot; killed those too weak to continue, though trucks picked up some of those too fatigued to go on. Prisoners were randomly stabbed with bayonets or beaten.

Once the surviving prisoners arrived in Balanga, the overcrowded conditions and poor hygiene caused dysentery and other diseases to spread rapidly. The Japanese did not provide the prisoners with medical care, so U.S. medical personnel tended to the sick and wounded with few or no supplies. Upon arrival at the San Fernando railhead, prisoners were stuffed into sweltering, brutally hot metal box cars for the one-hour trip to Capas, in heat. At least 100 prisoners were pushed into each of the unventilated boxcars. The trains had no sanitation facilities, and disease continued to take a heavy toll on the prisoners. According to Staff Sergeant Alf Larson:

Upon arrival at the Capas train station, they were forced to walk the final to Camp O&#x27;Donnell. Even after arriving at Camp O&#x27;Donnell, the survivors of the march continued to die at rates of up to several hundred per day, which amounted to a death toll of as many as 20,000 Americans and Filipinos. Most of the dead were buried in mass graves that the Japanese had dug behind the barbed wire surrounding the compound. Of the estimated 80,000 POWs at the march, only 54,000 made it to Camp O&#x27;Donnell.

The total distance of the march from Mariveles to San Fernando and from Capas to Camp O&#x27;Donnell is variously reported by differing sources as between . The Death March was later judged by an Allied military commission to be a Japanese war crime.

===Casualty estimates===
In an attempt to calculate the number of deaths during the march on the basis of evidence, Stanley L. Falk takes the number of American and Filipino troops known to have been present in Bataan at the start of April, subtracts the number known to have escaped to Corregidor and the number known to have remained in the hospital at Bataan. He makes a conservative estimate of the number killed in the final days of fighting and of the number who fled into the jungle rather than surrender to the Japanese. On this basis he suggests 600 to 650 American deaths and 5,000 to 10,000 Filipino deaths. Other sources report death numbers ranging from 5,000 to 18,000 Filipino deaths and 500 to 650 American deaths during the march.

==Wartime public responses==
===United States===
It was not until January 27, 1944, that the U.S. government informed the American public about the march, when it released sworn statements of military officers who had escaped. Shortly thereafter, the stories of these officers were featured in a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article. The Bataan Death March and other Japanese actions were used to arouse fury in the United States. America would go on to avenge its defeat that occurred in the Philippines during the Battle of Leyte in October 1944. U.S. and Filipino forces went on to recapture the Bataan Peninsula in January 1945, and Manila was liberated in early March.

General George Marshall made the following statement:
===Japanese===
In an attempt to counter the American propaganda value of the march, the Japanese had &quot;The Manila Times&quot; report that the prisoners were treated humanely and their death rate had to be attributed to the intransigence of the American commanders who did not surrender until the men were on the verge of death.

==War crimes trial==
In September 1945, Homma was arrested by Allied troops and indicted for war crimes. He was charged with 43 separate counts, but the verdict did not distinguish among them, leaving some doubt over whether he was found guilty of them all. Homma was found guilty of permitting members of his command to commit &quot;brutal atrocities and other high crimes&quot;. The general, who had been absorbed in his efforts to capture Corregidor after the fall of Bataan, claimed in his defense that he remained ignorant of the high death toll of the death march until two months after the event. Homma&#x27;s verdict was predicated on the doctrine of &quot;respondeat superior&quot; but with an added liability standard, since the latter could not be rebutted. On February 26, 1946 he was sentenced to death by firing squad and was executed on April 3 outside Manila.

Tsuji, who had directly ordered the killing of POWs, fled to China from Thailand when the war ended to escape the British authorities. Two of Homma&#x27;s subordinates, Major General Yoshitaka Kawane and Colonel Kurataro Hirano, were prosecuted by an American military commission in Yokohama in 1948, using evidence presented at the Homma trial. They were sentenced to death by hanging and executed at Sugamo Prison on June 12, 1949.

==Post-war commemorations, apologies, and memorials==
On September 13, 2010, Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada apologized to a group of six former American soldiers who had been held as prisoners of war by the Japanese, including 90-year-old Lester Tenney and Robert Rosendahl, both survivors of the Bataan Death March. The six, their families, and the families of two deceased soldiers were invited to visit Japan at the expense of the Japanese government.

In 2012, film producer Jan Thompson created a film documentary about the Death March, POW camps, and Japanese hell ships titled &quot;Never the Same: The Prisoner-of-War Experience&quot;. The film reproduced scenes of the camps and ships, showed drawings and writings of the prisoners, and featured Loretta Swit as the narrator.

Dozens of memorials (including monuments, plaques, and schools) dedicated to the prisoners who died during the Bataan Death March exist across the United States and in the Philippines. A wide variety of commemorative events are held to honor the victims, including holidays, athletic events such as ultramarathons, and memorial ceremonies held at military cemeteries. The Day of Valor is a Philippine national holiday that occurs every April 9, the day the Bataan Death March began.

=== New Mexico ===

The Bataan Death March had a large impact on New Mexico, given that many of the American soldiers in Bataan were from that state, specifically from the 200th and 515th Coast Artillery of the National Guard. The New Mexico Military Museum is located in the armory where the soldiers of the 200th and 515th were processed before their deployment to the Philippines in 1941. The old state capitol building of New Mexico was renamed the Bataan Memorial Building and now houses several state government agency offices.

Every year in early spring, the Bataan Memorial Death March, a marathon-length march/run, is conducted at the White Sands Missile Range. On 19 March 2017, over 6,300 participants queued up at the starting line for the 28th annual event, breaking the previous record of attendance as well as the amount of non-perishable food collected for local food pantries and overall charitable goods donated.

The 200th and 515th Coast Artillery units had 1,816 men total. 829 died in battle, while prisoners, or immediately after liberation. There were 987 survivors. , only four of these veterans remained alive.

=== Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory ===
Due to the large population of Filipino workers on the island of Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory, an annual memorial march is held. The date varies, but the marchers leave from the marina around 06:00 traveling by boat to Barton Point, where they proceed south to the plantation ruins. The memorial march is conducted by Filipino workers, British Royal Marines, British Royal Military Police, and United States sailors from various commands across the island.

<text>Boys&#x27; Night Out is a 1962 American romantic comedy film starring Kim Novak, James Garner, and Tony Randall, and featuring Howard Duff, Janet Blair, Howard Morris, Patti Page, Anne Jeffreys, Jessie Royce Landis and Oscar Homolka. The picture was directed by Michael Gordon and was written by Ira Wallach based on a story by Arne Sultan and Marvin Worth.

The film is about three men who are looking to meet needs that are not being satisfied in their marriages. Their bachelor friend arranges for a &quot;kept woman&quot; who is in reality a sociology student studying the fantasies of contemporary American men.

==Plot==
Three married men, George, Doug, and Howie, and divorcé Fred are friends who commute to work from Greenwich, Connecticut, to New York City on the same train. Seeing Fred&#x27;s philandering boss, Mr. Bingham, with his mistress sets the men to fantasizing about sharing the expense of an apartment in the city as a love nest. As a gag, they give Fred the task of finding an unrealistically inexpensive apartment and a blonde &quot;companion&quot; to go with it.

Fred rents a luxurious suite from Peter Bowers, who is desperate to find a tenant because the previous occupant was a highly publicized murder victim. By chance, Cathy, a beautiful blonde, also answers the advertisement for the apartment. Fred explains that the place has already been taken, but that he is also looking for a beautiful young &quot;housekeeper&quot; for his friends. To his surprise, she accepts the job. The boys are delighted; each tells his wife that he is taking a course one night a week at The New School for Social Research to improve his mind so he can stay in New York overnight.

Unbeknownst to the men, Cathy is actually a sociology graduate student writing her thesis on the &quot;adolescent fantasies of the adult suburban male.&quot; Her skeptical advisor, Dr. Prokosch, objects, saying, &quot;Can you look like &#x27;yes&#x27; and act like &#x27;no?&#x27; ... This a nice girl hasn&#x27;t learned.&quot; Cathy responds, &quot;No? This is what a nice girl has learned &quot;best&quot;.&quot; When they start calling on her individually in the evenings, she encourages them to talk, all the while secretly recording their conversations.

Cathy deftly avoids being seduced by the married men, although each lets the others think he has slept with her. She supplies what each one really wants: Howie is starved for more substantial food than his dieting wife will provide; Doug likes to repair things that are conveniently broken each week (his status-conscious wife does not want their neighbors to see him tinkering about the house); George enjoys talking about himself, but his spouse keeps finishing his sentences. Fred, however, is a different story: he is very attracted to Cathy and, disgusted by his friends&#x27; fabricated stories, refuses to use his night.

In the end, the wives become suspicious, and on the advice of Fred&#x27;s mother, Ethel, hire private investigator Ernest Bohannon to find out what is going on. Based on his report, they assume the worst and confront their husbands. All three married men confess that nothing happened, and Cathy reveals that she is just doing research.

After getting over the shock, Fred and Cathy become a couple, and the boys&#x27; night out is no more; instead, the four couples go out together.

==Production==
The film was a co production between Filmways and Kim Novak&#x27;s production company, Kimco. It was financed by Joseph E. Levine&#x27;s Embassy Pictures, the first film he made in the US. They sold the film to MGM. Novak was paid a reported $500,000. It was meant to be the first in a three-picture deal between Kimco and Filmways.

Director Michael Gordon later said:
That&#x27;s a picture that really started from a five page dirty joke that the writers sold to the producer. We didn&#x27;t have censorship ratings at that point; a picture either got the seal of approval or it didn&#x27;t. I was forced to clarify my ideas about that picture in a way that I think proved constructive. It forced me to recognise that the principal business is to expose certain aspects of human or social folly to ridicule.
Gig Young was offered a part but turned it down. Patti Page, cast in her third movie, later wrote she &quot;was shocked to learn that producer Martin Ransohoff actually wanted me to gain twenty pounds for the role... so I could play a somewhat dowdy Southern wife... Given how much the press had loved to talk about my weight going up and down in the past, I was hardly keen to purposely plump up. But I took the part because it was a great cast and I knew it would be a lot of fun.&quot; Page says she still was not &quot;fat enough&quot; for the director and producer so had to dress appropriately.

Garner wrote in his memoirs that Novak &quot;was beautiful and she had a wonderful quality that audiences liked but she didn&#x27;t know how to act. I think she was insecure because she was always running off the set to fix her face. She was more interested in her makeup than the script.&quot; Michael Gordon felt Garner &quot;was so good in both of the films I did with him that it made me feel I was stealing the money I was paid.&quot; He thought Novak was &quot;a nice gal&quot; adding &quot;while she wasn&#x27;t the easiest person to get an effective performance out of, I didn&#x27;t mind working with her. She tried very hard. She just wasn&#x27;t the most adept comedienne.&quot;

==Reception==
Financed by Novak&#x27;s Kimco production company and Filmways Pictures – and, it turned out, its first and last production – &quot;Boys&#x27; Night Out&quot; was intended to resurrect Novak&#x27;s career, which had hit a snag at the age of 29 with the death of Columbia Pictures&#x27; production head Harry Cohn, but it was not a financial or critical success. 
===Box Office===
According to MGM records, the film incurred a loss of $262,000. Although Novak&#x27;s career was not resurrected, it did propel James Garner&#x27;s forward.
===Critical===
&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;only sporadically amusing&quot;.
==Home media==
&quot;Boys&#x27; Night Out&quot; was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on December 22, 2010, via its Warner Archive DVD-on-demand service as a Region 1 DVD.

<text>Martin O&#x27;Donoghue (19 May 1933 – 20 July 2018) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Education from March 1982 to October 1982, Minister for Economic Planning and Development from 1977 to 1979 and Minister without portfolio in July 1977. He served as a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1983 to 1987. He also served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dún Laoghaire constituency from 1977 to 1982.

He was one of a few TDs to be appointed a Minister on their first day in the Dáil.

==Life==
O&#x27;Donoghue was born in Dublin in 1933. He was educated in Crumlin and worked as a waiter in Dublin, becoming a mature student at Trinity College Dublin and being awarded a Ph.D. in economics by Trinity College Dublin.

==Career==
From 1962 to 1964 and from 1967 to 1969, he was economic consultant at the Departments of Education and Finance respectively. He was elected a Fellow of Trinity College Dublin in 1969 and promoted to associate professor of Economics there in 1970. Between 1970 and 1973, O&#x27;Donoghue was economic adviser to the Taoiseach Jack Lynch.

===Politics===
At the 1977 general election O&#x27;Donoghue was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Dún Laoghaire constituency. He was chief author of the election manifesto which saw Fianna Fáil achieve an unprecedented twenty-seat majority. O&#x27;Donoghue was appointed Minister for Economic Planning and Development on his first day in office as a TD. In 1979, Charles Haughey became Taoiseach and O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s ministerial position was abolished. In 1982, O&#x27;Donoghue was returned to Cabinet as Minister for Education. He resigned from the government in October 1982, when he refused to support Haughey in a leadership challenge, and in November 1982 lost his Dáil seat at the general election.

O&#x27;Donoghue entered Seanad Éireann after losing his Dáil seat. He remained in the Seanad until 1987. Later he left Fianna Fáil, becoming a supporter of the Progressive Democrats.

===Later career===
O&#x27;Donoghue returned to academia until his retirement in 1995. In 1998, he became a director of the Central Bank of Ireland, serving with this and its successor body until the end of April 2008. He was a Fellow of Trinity College Dublin and served on the board of the O&#x27;Reilly Foundation.

He died on 20 July 2018.

<text>The Moskva (, &quot;Moskva-reka&quot;) is a river that flows through western Russia. It rises about west of Moscow and flows roughly east through the Smolensk and Moscow Oblasts, passing through central Moscow. About southeast of Moscow, at the city of Kolomna, it flows into the Oka, itself a tributary of the Volga, which ultimately flows into the Caspian Sea.

==History==
According to recent studies, the current riverbed of the Moscow River was occupied about 12 thousand years ago.

In addition to Finnic tribes, the Moskva River is also the origin of Slavic tribes such as the Vyatichi tribe.
==Etymology==

The name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the river. Several theories of the origin of the name have been proposed.

The most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto-Balto-Slavic root *&quot;mŭzg&quot;-/&quot;muzg&quot;- from the Proto-Indo-European *&quot;&quot;- &quot;wet&quot;, so the name &quot;Moskva&quot; might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh. Its cognates include , &quot;pool, puddle&quot;, and &quot;to wash&quot;, &quot;to drown&quot;, &quot;to dip, immerse&quot;. In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname, most common in Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and North Macedonia. Additionally, there are similarly named places in Poland like Mozgawa.

According to one of the Finno-Ugric hypotheses, the Merya and Muroma people, who were among the several pre-Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area, called the river &quot;Mustajoki&quot; &quot;Black river&quot;, and the name of the river derives from this term. Various other theories (of Celtic, Iranian, Caucasic origins), having little or no scientific ground, are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists.

To distinguish the river and the city, Russians usually call the river &quot;Moskva-reka&quot; (Moskva river) instead of just &quot;Moskva&quot;.

==Hydrology==

The river is long (or ), and the area of its drainage basin is . It has a vertical drop of (long-term average). The maximum depth is above Moscow city limits, and up to below it. Normally, it freezes in November–December and begins to thaw around late March. During an unusually warm winter in 2006–2007, ice began melting on January 25. The portion of the river running through Moscow only freezes occasionally on account of contamination.

The absolute water level in downtown Moscow is above sea level (long-term average of summer lows after World War II); a historical maximum of above sea level was set by the 1908 flood.

==Sources of water==
The main tributaries of the Moskva are, from source to mouth:

* Ruza (left)
* Istra (left)
* Skhodnya (left)
* Setun (right)
* Yauza (left)
* Pakhra (right)
* Pekhorka (left)
* Nerskaya (left)
* Severka (right)
Sources of water are estimated as 61% thaw, 12% rain and 27% subterranean. Since completion of the Moscow Canal (1932–1937), the Moskva River has also collected a share of Upper Volga water. This has enabled reliable commercial shipping, which was previously interrupted by summer droughts (older dams built in 1785, 1836 and 1878 were not effective). The average discharge, including Volga waters, varies from near Zvenigorod to at the Oka inlet. The speed of the current, depending on the season, varies from (winter, dams closed) to (May, dams open).

==Cities and towns==
Moscow (), the capital of Russia, is situated on its banks. The river also flows through the towns of Mozhaysk, Zvenigorod, Zhukovsky, Bronnitsy, Voskresensk, and — at the confluence of the Moskva and Oka — Kolomna. As of 2007, there are 49 bridges across the Moskva River and its canals within Moscow city limits; the first stone bridge, Bolshoy Kamenny Bridge, was erected in 1692. Within the city, the river is wide, the narrowest point being under the Kremlin walls. Drinking water for the city of Moscow is collected from five stations on the Moskva River and from the Upper Volga reservoirs (north and north-west of the city).

==Islands==
Canals, built within Moscow city limits, have created a number of islands. Some of them have names in Russian, some have none. Major, permanent islands (west to east) are:

One of the most famous is an unnamed artificial island in the center of the city between the river proper and the Bypass Canal
*Serebryany Bor (park). Separated from the mainland in the 1930s.
*Tatarskaya Poyma, commonly known as &quot;Mnyovniki&quot;. Separated from the mainland in the 1930s
*Balchug Island, also known as Bolotny Ostrov, lying just opposite the Kremlin. The island was formed by the construction of the Vodootvodny Canal in the 1780s, and has no official name in Russian. Moscow residents informally call it &quot;Bolotny Ostrov&quot; (Bog Island) while members of Moscow&#x27;s English-speaking community refer to it as &quot;Balchug&quot;.
*One uninhabited island north of Nagatino.
*Three uninhabited islands east of Nagatino, connected by the Pererva dam and lock system.

==Recreation==
There is a fleet of river ice-breaker cruisers which ply routes from moorings at the Hotel Ukraine and Gorky Park to the Novospassky Monastery and back. Duration of trips ranges from 1.5 to 3 hours.

<text>Charley&#x27;s Trace is a former Native American trail to the Mississippi River.

Charley&#x27;s Trace (also spelled Charlie&#x27;s Trace) is possibly named for a Choctaw trader who operated a steamboat fueling station near Clarksdale in the 1820s. There is some evidence that Hernando de Soto used Charley&#x27;s Trace to reach the Mississippi River on May 8, 1541. After the Mississippi Territory was open to settlement, Charley&#x27;s Trace connected to other roads such as Gaines Trace and was used by outlaws who operated in the Mississippi Delta.

Charley&#x27;s Trace is possibly depicted on the Baron de Crenay&#x27;s 1733 map of Louisiana. The 1755 Mitchell Map may also depict Charley&#x27;s Trace (labeled as &quot;Route of Colonel Welch to the Mississippi River in 1698, since followed by our Traders&quot;).

A historical marker was placed by the Chakchiuma Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution on February 20, 1926. The marker was replaced with a newer one on May 21, 1955. No marker exists at the site today.
