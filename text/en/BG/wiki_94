<text>Ludwig Anzengruber (29 November 1839 – 10 December 1889) was an Austrian dramatist, novelist and poet. He was born and died in Vienna, Austria.

== Origins==
The Anzengruber line originated in the district of Ried im Innkreis in Upper Austria. Ludwig&#x27;s grandfather, Jakob Anzengruber, was a farm-worker on the Obermayr estate at Weng near Hofkirchen an der Trattnach. His father, Johann Anzengruber, left the family home at an early age and moved to Vienna, where he found work as a bookkeeper in the treasury of the Austrian crown lands. In 1838 he married Maria Herbich, the daughter of a petit bourgeois pharmacist. It is not surprising that the social standing of his parents – his father, from peasant stock, and his mother, a petty bourgeois – regularly played an important role in Ludwig Anzengruber&#x27;s later works.

Ludwig&#x27;s greatest influence in becoming a dramatist was his father who himself had been a secret poet in the style of Friedrich Schiller, but without success. Only one of his plays, on the subject of Berthold Schwarz, was produced, and probably only because of the spectacular explosion at the end; his other works gathered dust in the drawer of his desk.

== Early life and career ==
Ludwig was only 5 years old when his father died in 1844. His mother, who was to become the most important person in his life as the years went on, tried to make ends meet with her meager widow&#x27;s pension of 166 guilders and 40 kreuzers. In 1854 when Ludwig’s grandmother, who had been supporting her daughter and grandchild substantially, died, his home and living arrangements became even worse. Financial emergencies drained their savings, but Ludwig&#x27;s mother was ready to make any sacrifice (including taking up work as a seamstress) so that he could study at the Paulaner elementary school from 1847 to 1850 and then at the Piarist high school from 1851 to 1853. In 1855 he dropped out of school due to increasingly bad grades and from 1856 to 1858 he was an apprentice at the Sallmeyer bookstore. During his employment at the bookstore he was able to read a great deal, but after disagreements with his master his apprenticeship came to an abrupt end.

At the age of 19, after a severe bout of typhoid, Ludwig decided to become an actor. Over the next ten years he tried his luck as a professional actor, travelling with different acting troupes throughout the provinces of Austria. He worked as a supporting actor in many a second-rate theatre, without, however, displaying any marked talent, and he never made the breakthrough to success, although his stage experience later stood him in good stead. One thing that hindered him was the dialect that he spoke, a dialect he was never able completely to get rid of. From 1866 he returned to live in Vienna again. During this time he wrote several dramas and some short stories, but these were unsuccessful.

== Creative period ==
In 1869 he found his way back into bourgeois society, when he took a job as a clerk (probably because he badly needed money) in the imperial police headquarters in Vienna. In 1870, under the pseudonym L. Gruber, he wrote what was to be his breakthrough, his anti-clerical drama &quot;Der Pfarrer von Kirchfeld&quot; (&quot;The Priest from Kirchfeld&quot;). The play was first produced at the &quot;Theater an der Wien&quot;, and its premiere on 5 November was a great success. Heinrich Laube, the head of the &quot;Burgtheater&quot;, wrote an enthusiastic review and through this Ludwig struck up a friendship with Peter Rosegger. His overnight success meant that the &quot;police official (4th class)&quot; could step off the career ladder of the civil service and devote himself entirely to literature, which saved him from conflict between being a poet and his duty to his office.

In 1873, despite his mother&#x27;s warnings, Anzengruber married the 16-year-old Adelinde Lipka (1857–1914). His young bride, the sister of his childhood friend Franz Lipka, was not up to the demands of practical life, and thus there were repeated crises in their marriage, although Ludwig&#x27;s considerable debts and very close relationship with his mother were often also to blame for this. Despite their three children, divorce was inevitable, and in 1889 the couple separated officially.

The following years were very successful for Anzengruber. His plays were produced throughout Europe, though his mother was never able to fully share in his success, as she had died in 1875. From April 1882 until May 1885 he was the editor of the Viennese paper &quot;Die Heimat&quot; (&quot;The Homeland&quot;), in May 1884 he became a contributing editor of the Viennese weekly magazine &quot;Figaro&quot; and in August 1888 he became the editor of the &quot;Wiener Bote&quot; (&quot;Vienna Messenger&quot;).

In September 1888 he was given the position of dramaturg for the &quot;Volkstheater Wien&quot; in Vienna, which opened on 14 September 1889 with his piece &quot;Der Fleck auf der Ehr&quot; (&quot;The Stain on Honour&quot;).

At the end of November, the dramatist, who was only fifty years old, became sick with anthrax, and not two weeks later died as a result of blood poisoning.

<text>Portland ( ) is a city in Victoria, Australia, and is the oldest European settlement in the state. It is also the main urban centre in the Shire of Glenelg and is located on Portland Bay. As of the 2021 census the population was 10,016, increasing from a population of 9,712 taken at the 2016 census.

==History==
===Early history===
The Gunditjmara, an Aboriginal Australian people, are the traditional owners of much of south-west Victoria, including what is now Portland, having lived there for thousands of years. They are today renowned for their early aquaculture development at nearby Lake Condah. Physical remains such as the weirs and fish traps are to be found in the Budj Bim heritage areas. The Gunditjmara were a settled people, living in small circular weather-proof stone huts about high, grouped as villages, often around eel traps and aquaculture ponds. On just one hectare of Allambie Farm, archaeologists have discovered the remains of 160 house sites.

====19th century European settlement====
Portland was named in 1800 by the British navigator James Grant, who sailed in the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; along the Victorian coast. &quot;I also distinguished the Bay by the name of Portland Bay, in honour of His Grace the Duke of Portland&quot;, wrote Grant. The bay, the only deep sea port between Adelaide and Melbourne, offers a sheltered anchorage against the often wild weather of Bass Strait.

By the early 19th century, whalers and sealers were working the treacherous waters of Bass Strait, and Portland Bay provided good shelter and fresh water, which enabled them to establish the first white settlement in the area. Whaling captain William Dutton is known to have been resident in the Portland Bay area when the Henty clan arrived, and is said to have provided seed potatoes for the Henty garden.

The Convincing Ground massacre, in which 20 native owners of the land were massacred by whalers, occurred in Portland Bay in 1833 or 1834, following a dispute about a beached whale between whalers and the &quot;Kilcarer gundidj&quot; clan of the Gunditjmara people.

In 1834, the year before Melbourne was founded, Edward Henty and his family, who had migrated from England to Western Australia in 1829, and then moved to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, ferried some of their stock across the Strait in search of the fine grazing land of the Western District. After a voyage of 34 days, the &quot;Thistle&quot; arrived at Portland Bay on 19 November 1834. Henty was only 24 years old, and, early in December, cultivated the land using a plough he had made himself. He was the first white man to turn a sod in Victoria. The next voyage of the &quot;Thistle&quot; brought his brother Francis, with additional stock and supplies, and in a short time houses were erected and fences put up.

In his diary entry for 3 December 1834, Henty wrote:

&quot;Arrived at 6 p.m., made the boat fast in the middle of the river, and started three days&#x27; walk in the bush accompanied by H Camfield, Wm Dutton, five men, one black woman and 14 dogs, each man with a gun and sufficient quantity of damper to last for the voyage.&quot;

In the 5 December entry Henty wrote:

&quot;On descending the hill we saw a native. He immediately ran on seeing us. He was busily employed pulling the gums from the wattle trees.&quot;

Henty sowed the first Victorian wheat crop on clifftop land, known today as &quot;The Ploughed Field&quot;.

The Hentys were &quot;discovered&quot; in Portland by the explorer Thomas Mitchell in 1836. The squatter settlement was illegal since, at that time, the British Colonial Office policy was to contain colonial settlements in Australia within geographic limits. It had been still considering how to deal with the rights to the land of Aboriginal Victorians. The Hentys also farmed in areas known as &quot;Australia Felix&quot;, around Casterton.

By 1838, land auctions had been authorised from Sydney, and Charles Tyers surveyed the Portland township in 1839. &quot;It was government policy to encourage squatters to take possession of whatever land they chose&quot;. A Post Office was opened on 4 December 1841, the third to open in the Port Phillip District after Melbourne and Geelong.

During the 1840s the Eumeralla Wars between Europeans and Gunditjmara took place in the area between Portland and Port Fairy.

At Wesleyan Mission meeting in 1841, Rev. Benjamin Hurst (missionary to Aboriginal people at Port Phillip) noted that in the Portland bay area &quot;it was usual for some to go out in parties on the Sabbath with guns, for the ostensible purpose of kangarooing, but, in reality to hunt and kill these miserable beings&quot;.

Around 1842 a Presbyterian church and school were founded by the Rev. Alexander Laurie (c. 1817–1854), who later ran the &quot;Portland Herald&quot;. His widow Janet Laurie (Black) and two sons founded &quot;The Border Watch&quot; in nearby Mount Gambier.

From the time of European settlement, the region around Melbourne was known as the Port Phillip District, and this gained some administrative status prior to separation from New South Wales and the declaration as the Colony of Victoria in 1851.

===1985: Proclamation as a city===
Portland was proclaimed a city on Monday 28 October 1985, in the presence of Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales.

==Governance and demographics==
Portland is in the Victorian Legislative Assembly electoral district of South West Coast, the Western Victoria Region of the Victorian Legislative Council and the federal Division of Wannon. It is in the local government area of the Shire of Glenelg. Its postcode is 3305.

On 30 March 2007, the Gunditjmara people were recognised by the Federal Court of Australia to be the native title-holders of almost of Crown land and waters in the Portland region. On 27 July 2011, together with the Eastern Maar people, the Gunditjmara People were recognised to be the native title-holders of almost of Crown land in the Yambuk region, including Lady Julia Percy Island, known to them as &quot;Deen Maar&quot;. The Gunditjmara People are represented by the Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation.

, after a question raised at a council meeting by resident Shea Rotumah, who is of the &quot;kilcarer gundidj&quot; clan of the Gunditjmara people, the council is undertaking an audit of their colonial monuments, to assess the &quot;nature and magnitude of monuments and place names across the shire&quot;. The mayor, Anita Rank, sees it as &quot;an amazing opportunity for our community to be better educated&quot;.

At the Portland had a population of 10,016 people.

==Economy==

===Port===
Through the 19th century Portland developed to become an important fishing port providing for the town and later, with the connection of the railway, to the region as far afield as Ballarat and eventually Melbourne. Barracouta, Australian salmon and crayfish (now southern rock lobster) were the main catches with many fishermen working the bay, around the Lawrence Rocks and in the season, Bridgewater Bay.

Portland&#x27;s harbour enabled the development of the wool growing industry of the Western District, however it has since lost its primacy to facilities at Geelong. Even in western Victoria, Portland fell behind Warrnambool as the main commercial centre. In the 20th century Portland&#x27;s role as a port revived, and its economy was also boosted by the tourism industry and an aluminium smelter.

The port of Portland was sold in 1996 by the State Government to a group including the listed New Zealand company Infratil &amp; the Scott Corporation (owned by Allan Scott), the first privatisation of port facilities in Australia. Since then, it has been traded a number of times and is now owned by two institutional investors – the publicly listed Australian Infrastructure Fund and Utilities Trust of Australia, a private infrastructure fund – both of which are managed by Hastings Funds Management.

As new supertankers have emerged, Portland, along with Hastings in Western Port Bay was proposed as an alternative to the controversial plans for deepening of Melbourne&#x27;s shallower Port Phillip. The plans are aimed at maintaining Victoria&#x27;s shipping status (since Melbourne has become Australia&#x27;s busiest port, the Victorian economy relies heavily on the import and export of goods). Due to environmental reasons, the plan to deepen Port Phillip has been heavily criticised, whereas Portland offers some of the necessary infrastructure with minimum environmental impact.

The Port of Portland has received major assistance through public funding of an A$18 million overpass which gives better access to the port for heavy traffic. In 2007, the Glenelg Shire Council adopted a plan for the redesign and development of the foreshore precinct including a new multi purpose marina in the north-west corner of the harbour.

=== Portland Aluminium ===
Alcoa is Victoria&#x27;s largest exporter. The Portland aluminium smelter is located in Portland in South West Victoria. The smelter was commissioned in 1987 and is managed by Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals for Portland Aluminium (a joint venture project between Alcoa (55%), CITIC (22.5%) and Marubeni (22.5%)).

Portland is Australia&#x27;s third largest aluminium smelter, with a capacity of around 352,000 tonnes of aluminium per annum. The majority of Portland&#x27;s production is supplied to the export market.

The Portland Aluminium smelter, in conjunction with Alcoa&#x27;s Point Henry smelter which closed in 2014, produced about 30% of Australia&#x27;s total aluminium.

===The fishing industry today===
Portland today is the home of a varied professional fishing fleet of approximately 60 vessels, harvesting a wide variety of sustainable commercial species. During the austral summer (November to May), the Bonney Upwelling (part of the larger Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System) brings nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface in the Portland area, supporting a rich abundance of marine life. Trawlers target deepsea finfish such as rockling, hoki, blue eye trevalla and more, while Southern rock lobster, giant crab, blacklip and greenlip abalone, arrow squid, wrasse and others are also landed in significant quantities. The industry is a significant employer and directly generates approximately $30 million in export and domestic earnings for the town with major flow-on benefits through local seafood processing (both export and domestic), transport &amp; engineering services, fuel supplies and other ancillary industries. An abalone hatchery has been established on the shores of Portland Bay and apart from some current difficulties, is likely to be an indicator of future seafood production. Easy access to prime locations supports a flourishing amateur angling fraternity, with many locals and tourists regularly enjoying a fresh catch of King George Whiting, Snapper, Kingfish, Flathead, Morwong and in recent times, Southern bluefin tuna.

===Vestas Portland===
The first blades from the Vestas Portland plant were produced in July 2005 and the plant was officially commissioned in August 2005. The facility cost $9 million, and has a capacity of 225 blades (75 blade sets) per annum. Vestas began manufacturing wind turbines in 1979. Their core business comprises the development, manufacture, sale, marketing and maintenance of wind power systems. The blade manufacturing facility in Portland worked in conjunction with their assembly plant in Tasmania which has since been closed down. In August 2007, Vestas announced the closure of its near new Portland blade manufacturing plant with the loss of 130 jobs.

===Portland Wind Project===

The Portland Wind Energy Project, PWEP involves the development of four wind farms at Cape Bridgewater, Cape Nelson, Cape Sir William Grant and Yambuk in south-west Victoria. As one of the biggest wind farm developments in the Southern Hemisphere, the 195MW project proponents claimed that it will deliver major environmental, economic and social benefits.

The four Portland sites are considered by the proponents of the project to be ideal wind farm locations, with consistently strong winds, access for construction vehicles and machinery, a nearby connection to the National Electricity Grid, compatible farming activities and a large land area. By August 2007 construction was underway but there is still ongoing substantial resident opposition to the project regarding the planning process enabling this development and the visual impact of towers and the power lines.

The 195MW project will produce enough clean electricity to power about 125,000 homes each year, equal to more than 7 per cent of Victoria&#x27;s residential electricity demand, or powering a city the size of Geelong. The project is being developed by Pacific Hydro.

===Geothermal power===

Geothermal heating was used to heat more than 19,000 square metres of municipal buildings, a motel and the town 2000m³ swimming pool in Portland. Commissioned in 1983, naturally hot groundwater (58 °C) was extracted from a bore (1400m deep) at a rate of 90 litres/second. The total capacity of the Portland facility, operated by the Glenelg Shire was 10.4 MW before being closed down prematurely in April 2006. 

===Tourism===
The Great South West Walk is a walking track that begins at the Visitor Information Centre, Portland. Designed as a long distance walking track, it is also ideal for short walks and day walks. The walk travels through forests, river gorges, cliff tops and sublime bays. Established in 1981 the walk is administered, maintained and promoted by &#x27;The Friends of the Great South West Walk Inc&#x27;, a wholly volunteer organisation, in partnership with Parks Victoria.

The Portland Cable Tram was established as a community organisation in June 1996, with the view to laying light rail to carry refurbished diesel powered trams, as both an outlet for rail and heritage enthusiasts and a tourist venture. The tram carries passengers along the scenic route from Henty Park to the World War 2 Memorial Lookout, at the old North Portland Water Tower. The route takes in the natural wetlands (tidal) of Fawthrop Lagoon Park, the foreshore, cliff tops and botanic gardens. The Portland Cable Tram Group is planning additional tram carriages and engines, for greater capacity and to provide more reliability and maintenance support options. Volunteer drivers and conductors provide a commentary about Portland&#x27;s significant past and present-day buildings, harbour and sights. Over 12,000 passengers were carried on the tram during the 2006–07 financial year.

===Portland Maritime Museum===
The Portland Maritime Museum was developed to house the Portland Lifeboat built in 1858. The Lifeboat is one of the oldest lifeboats remaining in the world. Famous for rescuing 19 survivors of the &quot;Admella&quot; shipwreck in 1859, and the Julia shipwreck in 1863. The &quot;Admella&quot;, a steamship of 392 tons, was sailing from Adelaide to Melbourne when it was smashed onto a reef off Carpenter Rocks in South Australia with a loss of 89 lives. The Portland Lifeboat and crew were taken to the scene, and were pivotal in the rescue operations. On display is a real whale skeleton, and the famed &#x27;Portland Lifeboat&#x27; used in the &quot;Admella&quot; rescue.

==Transport==

===Road===
Portland is west of Melbourne via the Princes Highway. It is connected to Hamilton by the Henty Highway.

===Rail===
Portland is served by the standard gauge Maroona-Portland line, which branches from the main Western standard gauge line. Until 1995 the line was broad gauge, the line having been opened on 19 December 1877. Passenger movements are by coach to Warrnambool where passengers transfer to rail, the last direct passenger train between Ararat and Portland was on 12 September 1981 operated by a DRC railcar. Grain is the most common commodity delivered by rail from the Wimmera.

Transport Minister Peter Batchelor, opened a $15m overpass in Cliff Street constructed for VicRoads in October 2006. The government committed to the project in May 2003, and work began in 2005. The overpass allows road transports and trains continuous access to the port; moving commodities like grain, fertiliser, wind-farm blades, aluminium ingots and woodchips. Port activity is projected to increase significantly and the overpass, which had been discussed since 1991, was finally installed. The project was completed three months ahead of schedule because of the drought and less than the expected delays due to rain.

Freight operator Pacific National indefinitely suspended all rail services to the town of Portland in 2004, impacting local companies including Portland Aluminium, transport company Kalari, and freight broker Anchor Logistics. Portland container traffic was conveyed between Maroona and Portland on grain services twice a week, but Pacific National said that due to the drought there were no trains to attach the loading to. On the route the price differential between rail and road is $12.97 per tonne in rail&#x27;s favour. Pacific National closed their Portland operations in March 2008, with GrainCorp leasing a limited number of locomotives and rolling stock from them, but favour transporting grain to the Port of Geelong instead. In September 2008 it was announced that freight traffic would restart using the line from Portland, with operator El Zorro signing a multi-million deal with miner Iluka Resources to carry containerised mineral sands to Melbourne, with Iluka saying rail transport was cheaper than road.

===Aviation===
Portland is served by the Portland Airport . Sharp Airlines provided a regular service to Portland and Warrnambool airports from Essendon airport up until 30 June 2019. Sharp Airlines started operations in Portland by flying staff and employees from Portland Aluminium to Avalon Airport, so they could link to the Point Henry Smelter near Geelong. With significant demand and the support of the community, non-charter, passenger flights were also added. Sharp has established a maintenance hub at Portland Airport, so support staff could service the growing commuter and tourist airline.

===Radio===
Community radio station 3RPC-FM 99.3 is located opposite The Arts Company, on the corner of Richmond Street, and broadcasts to the majority of the Shire of Glenelg. This too lends itself to the promotion of the city&#x27;s various performances, exhibitions and cultural events. Each week volunteer presenters write and produce many hours of on-air entertainment covering arts, culture, sport, community news and special interest programs.

Portland tourist radio station is WAVE-FM, broadcasting easy listening music, news and information about local attractions.

===Arts &amp; culture===

Portland has a vibrant cultural diversity, with many potters, painters, musicians, quilters, lead lighters, wood-turners, photographers, cinematographers, multi-media artists, print-makers, jewellers, sculptors, actors and writers. Many of these talents come together under the banners of CEMA Inc (Council for Encouragement of Music and the Arts), or the associated The Arts Company.

The Portland Art Centre, on the corner of Glenelg and Bentinck Streets, incorporates a gallery and theatre, where local and visiting performances are regularly staged.
The Arts Company is located in the heritage precinct of Portland in refurbished old buildings in Julia Street. Along with community workshops and studios, local artists&#x27; works are also for sale. The Arts Company also has accommodation and studios for the &quot;artist in residence&quot; programs.

===Sport===
The town has an Australian rules football team competing in the Hampden Football League. The club is known as Portland Football Netball Cricket Club.

The Portland and District Cricket Association is the local cricket association, with 6 clubs competing from the local area.

Golfers play at the course of the Portland Golf Club on Madeira Packet Road.

The Portland Hockey club plays in the Lower South East Hockey Association. Games are mainly played in Mount Gambier on an artificial turf pitch. However, some games are played in Portland at Nelson Park on grass pitches. Training is at Flinders Park.

Portland also has a soccer team, the Portland Panthers, and they play most of their games with the Mount Gambier Sides.

==Climate==
Portland has a cool mediterranean climate that is transitional with the oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb/Cfb&quot;). Its summers as well as annual mean temperature, are extraordinarily cold for the latitude due to facing the coldest ocean in the world; the rainy winters have moderate lows. 

Rainfall and temperature records are found as early as 1857 and 1863 at the old Portland site, having terminated at 1956 for temperature readings but still recording rainfall (being one of the longest-running in Australia).

<text>In number theory, a deficient number or defective number is a positive integer for which the sum of divisors of is less than . Equivalently, it is a number for which the sum of proper divisors (or aliquot sum) is less than . For example, the proper divisors of 8 are , and their sum is less than 8, so 8 is deficient.

Denoting by the sum of divisors, the value is called the number&#x27;s deficiency. In terms of the aliquot sum , the deficiency is .

==Examples== 

The first few deficient numbers are
:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, ... 
As an example, consider the number 21. Its divisors are 1, 3, 7 and 21, and their sum is 32. Because 32 is less than 42, the number 21 is deficient. Its deficiency is 2 × 21 − 32 = 10.

==Properties==
Since the aliquot sums of prime numbers equal 1, all prime numbers are deficient. More generally, all odd numbers with one or two distinct prime factors are deficient. It follows that there are infinitely many odd deficient numbers. There are also an infinite number of even deficient numbers as all powers of two have the sum ().

More generally, all prime powers formula_1 are deficient, because their only proper divisors are formula_2 which sum to formula_3, which is at most formula_4.

All proper divisors of deficient numbers are deficient. Moreover, all proper divisors of perfect numbers are deficient.

There exists at least one deficient number in the interval formula_5 for all sufficiently large &quot;n&quot;.

==Related concepts==

Closely related to deficient numbers are perfect numbers with &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 2&quot;n&quot;, and abundant numbers with &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; 2&quot;n&quot;. 

Nicomachus was the first to subdivide numbers into deficient, perfect, or abundant, in his &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; (circa 100 CE). However, he applied this classification only to the even numbers.

<text>Yau Ma Tei is an area in the Yau Tsim Mong District in the south of the Kowloon Peninsula in Hong Kong.
==Name==
&quot;Yau Ma Tei&quot; is a phonetic transliteration of the name (originally written as ) in Cantonese. It can also be spelt as Yaumatei, Yau Ma Ti, Yaumati or Yau-ma-Tee.

&quot;Yau&quot; () literally means &quot;oil&quot;, &quot;Ma&quot; ( or ) can either refer to &quot;sesame&quot; or &quot;jute&quot;, and &quot;Tei&quot; (地) means &quot;field&quot; or &quot;open ground&quot;. Hence, &quot;Yau Ma Tei&quot; can be interpreted to mean either &quot;oil-sesame field&quot; or &quot;oil and jute ground&quot;. This dual-interpretation is perhaps the reason for there being two explanations for the origin of the place name.

==Geography==
Dundas Street marks the north border of Yau Ma Tei with Mong Kok and Austin Road its south border with Jordan and Tsim Sha Tsui. To its west is Victoria Harbour and its east the hilly region of Ho Man Tin.

Southern Yau Ma Tei was traditionally known as Kwun Chung, but came to be called Jordan after the completion of Jordan MTR station at its heart.

==History==

Yau Ma Tei was a village in Kowloon. It was mentioned that a Chinese burial ground was assigned at a mile northeast of a village of Yau-ma-Tee at 2 December 1871. The name Yau Ma Tei is not thought to pre-date British rule. However, Kwun Chung is mentioned in many historic documents. Kwun Chung was a river valley with village and cultivation. To the south, a hill near the coast was used as a fortification by the military of the Qing dynasty during the 19th century. In 1839, Qing official Lin Zexu ordered the construction of a fortification in the area to defend against possible British attacks. When the First Opium War broke out, the fortification, along with another fort in Tsim Sha Tsui, saw action against British forces during the Battle of Kowloon.

Before the ceding of Kowloon to the British in 1860, Yau Ma Tei was a beach and a bay gathering many Tanka fishermen. Its water remains a harbour for fishermen after several times of reclamation by the Hong Kong Government. The Yau Ma Tei Typhoon Shelter became an exotic water area where restaurants on boats offered dishes of indigenous seafood. These &#x27;typhoon shelter dishes&#x27; remain famous to this day and are even offered on land. The typhoon shelter not only hosted fishermen, but was also a port in Hong Kong. Numerous piers were built along its shore. Ferry Point in the southern part of Yau Ma Tei was a transportation hub where many commuters took ferries to and from Hong Kong Island. The service was offered by Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry.

Inland, the reclamation became the residential area for the ever-increasing Chinese population, with retail shops on the street level. Shanghai Street was the main street before being replaced by Nathan Road. Along Waterloo Road is the century-old Fruit Market; its adjacent Yaumati Theatre was once the largest in Kowloon. The Kwong Wah Hospital was the first hospital on the Kowloon peninsula, established in 1911. YMCA headquarters and its hostel in Hong Kong are located on the road. On 26 January 2021, 12 buildings in Yau Ma Tei were placed under lockdown due to COVID-19.

==Public health==
Kwong Wah Hospital, run by charity Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, is the first major hospital in the area. Historically, there was a small pox hospital () at the hill northeast of Kwong Wah Hospital. Founded by Hong Kong Government, Queen Elizabeth Hospital is another major hospital in the area.

Yaumatei Maternal &amp; Child Health Centre () is under Family Health Service, Department of Health.

==Sightseeing==

The district is mainly an area of mixed residential and retail. During day time, the Yau Ma Tei wet market and fruit market are the markets to visit, buying souvenirs like dried noodles and some fruits. Every night there is a market selling many different kinds of products including clothes, decorations, VCD and toys in Temple Street, a street in the area where the famous Tin Hau Temple was built in 1876. The Temple is at Public Square Street. The square, known as Yung Shue Tau, was a night market. Jade Market and Jade Street, China&#x27;s most revered green stone is in abundance here, with around 400 registered stall owners ready to pitch jade amulets, ornaments, necklaces and trinkets.

<text>Henry Steele Commager (October 25, 1902 – March 2, 1998) was an American historian. As one of the most active and prolific liberal intellectuals of his time, with 40 books and 700 essays and reviews, he helped define modern liberalism in the United States.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Commager was noted for his campaigns against McCarthyism and other abuses of government power. With his Columbia University colleague Allan Nevins, Commager helped to organize academic support for Adlai E. Stevenson in 1952 and 1956, and John F. Kennedy in 1960. He opposed the Vietnam War and was an outspoken critic of presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan and what he viewed as their abuses of presidential power.

His principal scholarly works were his 1936 biography of Theodore Parker; his intellectual history &quot;The American Mind: An Interpretation of American Thought and Character Since the 1880s&quot; (1950), which focuses on the evolution of liberalism in the American political mind from the 1880s to the 1940s, and his intellectual history &quot;Empire of Reason: How Europe Imagined and America Realized the Enlightenment&quot; (1977). In addition, he edited a widely used compilation, &quot;Documents of American History&quot;; ten editions were published between 1938 and 1988, the last coedited with Commager&#x27;s former student, Milton Cantor.

==Background==
Commager was born Henry Irving Commager on October 25, 1902, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of James Williams and Anne Elizabeth (Dan) Commager. After his mother died when he was ten, he was raised by his maternal grandfather in Chicago, Illinois. He attended the University of Chicago and earned degrees in history: Bachelor of Philosophy (1923), Master of Arts (1924), and Doctor of Philosophy (1928). He lived in Copenhagen for a year researching his dissertation on the political reform movement in Denmark led by Johann Friedrich Struensee.

Commager married Evan Alexa Carroll (died 1968) of South Carolina in 1928. The couple had three children: Henry Steele Commager Jr. (1932–1984), known as Steele Commager, who became a classicist at Columbia University and wrote one of the leading books on the Roman poet Horace; Elizabeth Carroll Commager; and Nellie Thomas McColl Commager (now Nell Lasch, wife of the historian Christopher Lasch). Evan Commager wrote several books, including &quot;Cousins&quot;, &quot;Tenth Birthday&quot;, &quot;Beaux&quot;, and &quot;Valentine&quot;.

In 1979, Commager married Mary Powlesland, a professor in Latin American studies, in Linton, England.

Commager died of pneumonia at the age of ninety-five on March 2, 1998, in Amherst.

==Career==
Commager originally studied Danish history, and wrote his PhD dissertation on the Danish philosopher Johann Friedrich Struensee, a major reformer during the Enlightenment. Under the influence of his mentor at Chicago, the constitutional historian Andrew C. McLaughlin, Commager shifted his research and teaching interests to American history. Another of his mentors was the colonial American historian Marcus W. Jernegan, for whom he later co-edited a festschrift (with William T. Hutchison), &quot;The Marcus W. Jernegan Essays in American Historiography&quot; (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1937).

Commager taught at New York University from 1926 to 1939, at Columbia University from 1939 to 1956, and at Amherst College in Massachusetts from 1956 to 1992. He retired in 1992 from the John Woodruff Simpson Lectureship, and died, aged 95, in Amherst, Massachusetts. Commager emphasized to his generations of students that historians must write not only for one another but for a wider audience.

Commager&#x27;s first solo book was his 1936 biography &quot;Theodore Parker: Yankee Crusader&quot;, a life of the Unitarian minister, transcendentalist, reformer, and abolitionist Theodore Parker; it was reissued in 1960, along with a volume edited by Commager collecting the best known of Parker&#x27;s many writings. Two characteristic books were his 1950 intellectual history &quot;The American Mind: An Interpretation of American Character Thought Since the 1880s&quot; and his 1977 study &quot;The Empire of Reason: How Europe Imagined and America Realized the Enlightenment&quot;.

Commager was principally an intellectual and cultural historian; he was influenced by the literary historian Vernon L. Parrington, but also worked in the fields of constitutional and political history. His work on this subject includes his 1943 series of controversial lectures, &quot;Majority Rule and Minority Rights&quot;, which argued for a curtailed scope for judicial review, pointing out on the history of the US Supreme Court&#x27;s uses of judicial review to strike down economic regulatory legislation in the first decades of the twentieth century. Later, Commager espoused the use of judicial review by the Supreme Court under the leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren to protect racial and religious minorities from discrimination and to safeguard individual liberties as protected by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment.

==Textbooks and editing==
Commager was coauthor, with Samuel Eliot Morison, of the widely used history text &quot;The Growth of the American Republic&quot; (1930; 1937; 1942; 1950, 1962; 1969; 7th ed., with William E. Leuchtenburg, 1980; abridged editions in 1980 and 1983 under the title &quot;Concise History of the American Republic&quot;). His anthology, &quot;Documents of American History&quot; (1938), reaching its tenth edition (co-edited with his former student Milton Cantor) in 1988, half a century after its first appearance, remains a standard collection work of primary sources. His two documentary histories, &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot; and &quot;The Spirit of Seventy-Six&quot; (the latter co-edited with his longtime friend and Columbia colleague Richard B. Morris), are comprehensive collections of primary sources on the Civil War and the American Revolution as seen by participants.

With Richard B. Morris, he also co-edited the highly influential New American Nation Series, a multi-volume collaborative history of the United States under whose aegis appeared many significant and prize-winning works of historical scholarship. (This series was a successor to the American Nation series planned and edited at the beginning of the twentieth century by the Harvard historian Albert Bushnell Hart.)

At Columbia, Commager mentored a series of distinguished historians who earned their PhD degrees under his tutelage, including Harold Hyman, Leonard W. Levy, and William E. Leuchtenburg. They joined together in 1967 to present him with a festschrift, or commemorative collection of essays, dedicated to him, titled &quot;Freedom and Reform&quot; (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967). When he moved to Amherst, an elite undergraduate college, he no longer mentored PhD candidates, but he mentored undergraduates, including R. B. Bernstein, who later became a historian of the U.S. Constitution and a specialist in the era of the American Revolution.

===Liberalism===
Commager felt a duty as a professional historian to reach out to his fellow citizens. He believed that an educated public that understands American history would support liberal programs, especially internationalism and the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although he was skilled at scholarly research and analysis, he preferred to devise and expound sweeping interpretations of historical events and processes, while also making available primary sources so that people could study history for themselves. Commager was representative of a generation of like-minded historians widely read by the general public, including Samuel Eliot Morison, Allan Nevins, Richard Hofstadter, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., and C. Vann Woodward. Commager&#x27;s biographer Neil Jumonville has argued that this style of influential public history has been lost in the 21st century, because political correctness has rejected Commager&#x27;s open marketplace of tough ideas. Jumonville says history now features abstruse deconstruction by experts, with statistics instead of stories, and is comprehensible now only to the initiated, with ethnocentrism ruling in place of common identity.

Commager was a liberal interpreter of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, which he understood as creating a powerful general government that at the same time recognized a wide spectrum of individual rights and liberties. Commager opposed McCarthyism in the 1940s and 1950s, the war in Vietnam (on constitutional grounds), and what he saw as the rampant illegalities and unconstitutionalities perpetrated by the administrations of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. One favorite cause was his campaign to point out that, because the budget of the Central Intelligence Agency is classified, it violates the requirement of Article One of the Constitution that no moneys can be spent by the federal government except those specifically appropriated by Congress.

===Essays===
Commager wrote hundreds of essays and opinion pieces on history or presenting a historical perspective on current issues for popular magazines and newspapers. He collected many of the best of these articles and essays in such books as &quot;Freedom, Loyalty, Dissent&quot;; &quot;The Search for a Usable Past and Other Essays in Historiography&quot;; &quot;Freedom and Order: A Commentary on the American Political Scene&quot;; &quot;The Commonwealth of Learning&quot;; &quot;The Defeat of America: War, Presidential Power and the National Character&quot;; and &quot;Jefferson, Nationalism, and the Enlightenment.&quot; He often was interviewed on television news programs and public-affairs documentaries to provide historical perspective on such events as the Apollo 11 Moon landing and the Watergate crisis. Benjamin W. Cramer states:
===Civil rights===

Although at first Commager was not deeply concerned with race, he became an advocate for civil rights for African Americans, as he was for other groups. In 1949 he fought to allow the African-American historian John Hope Franklin to present a paper at the Southern Historical Association and agreed to introduce him to the group. In 1953 the NAACP Legal Defense Fund asked Commager for advice for their argument before the Supreme Court for the case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, but at the time he was not persuaded that this litigation would succeed on historical grounds, and so advised the lawyers.

=== Declaration of Interdependence ===

In 1975 Commager wrote a Declaration of Interdependence, and presented it to the World Affairs Councils of Philadelphia on October 24, 1975. It was signed in a ceremonial signing on January 30, 1976, at Congress Hall, Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia, by several members of Congress. It was also &quot;endorsed&quot; by a number of non-governmental organizations and United Nations specialized agencies.

The document stressed the importance of international law, conservation of natural resources, disarmament, the world&#x27;s oceans, and the peaceful exploration of outer space, among other things.

When drafting the document Commager was assisted by an &quot;Advisory Committee&quot; including Raymond Aron, Herbert Agar, Leonard Woodcock, Archibald MacLeish, and others.

==Criticism==
Commager and his co-author Samuel Eliot Morison received vigorous criticism from African-American intellectuals and other scholars for their popular textbook &quot;The Growth of the American Republic&quot;, first published in 1930. (Although Morison was responsible for the textbook&#x27;s controversial section on slavery and references to the slave as &quot;Sambo&quot;, and Commager was the junior member of the writing team when the book was first published and always deferred to Morison&#x27;s greater age and academic stature, Commager has not been spared from charges of racism in this matter.) The textbook was attacked for its uncritical depiction of slavery in America and its depiction of African-American life after emancipation and during Reconstruction. The original editions of the textbook published between 1930 and 1942 echoed the thesis of &quot;American Negro Slavery&quot; (1918) by Ulrich Bonnell Phillips and the scholarship of William Archibald Dunning, relying on the one-sided personal records of slaveowners and portraying slavery as a mainly benign institution. As the historian Herbert Gutman said, this scholarship focused on the question: &quot;What did slavery do for the slave?&quot; Its answer was that slavery lifted the slaves out of the barbarism of Africa, Christianized them, protected them, and generally benefited them. In 1944, the NAACP launched criticism of the textbook; by 1950, under pressure from students and younger colleagues, Morison, denying any racist intent (he noted that his daughter had been married to Joel Elias Spingarn, a former President of the NAACP), reluctantly agreed to most of the demanded changes. Morison refused, however, to remove repeated references to the anti-abolitionist caricature of &quot;Sambo&quot;, which he claimed were vital in understanding the racist nature of American culture in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an era when even the most enlightened progressive thinkers routinely explained many aspects of human behavior as being a result of innate racial or ethnic characteristics.

August A. Meier, a young professor at a black southern college, Tougaloo College, and a former student of Commager, corresponded with Morison and Commager at the time, in an effort to get them to change their textbook; he reported that Morison &quot;just didn&#x27;t get it&quot; and in particular did not understand the negative effects that the Sambo stereotype was having on young impressionable students. On the other hand, Meier found that Commager, although at first woefully unaware of black history, was openminded on the subject and willing to learn and change. Morison did not agree to remove Sambo until the fifth edition, which appeared in 1962.

On June 22, 1953, Whittaker Chambers, an intellectual leader on the right, ridiculed Commager as suffering &quot;the liberal neurosis&quot; for stating that America is suffering repression &quot;more violent, more reckless, more dangerous than any in our history.&quot;

<text>Fergus Stewart Ewing (born 23 September 1957) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who served as the Scottish Government&#x27;s Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy and Tourism from 2016 to 2021, having previously held two junior ministerial posts. He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 1999, representing Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber until 2011, and then its successor seat Inverness and Nairn.

== Early life ==
Ewing is the son of the veteran Scottish nationalist Winnie Ewing, who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons, as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), and an MSP. His father was an SNP local councillor. He has long been active in the Scottish National Party.

Educated at Loretto School, in Musselburgh, he read Law at the University of Glasgow where he was a member of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association. At the age of 18, he was employed as his mother&#x27;s secretary in the European Parliament.

== Member of the Scottish Parliament ==
Ewing unsuccessfully contested Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber in the 1992 Westminster general election, and Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber in 1997. He was elected to represent Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber in the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and he held on to the seat in 2003 and 2007.

He and his mother, Winnie Ewing both abstained from the vote to abolish Section 28 via the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000; he also opposed an outright ban on fox hunting.

=== Ministerial career ===
After the SNP&#x27;s victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, Ewing was appointed as the Minister for Community Safety. After the SNP victory at the 2011 Scottish Parliament Election, he was appointed as the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, succeeding Jim Mather who stood down as an MSP. In February 2014 he voted against the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Scotland. In November 2014 the portfolio became Business Energy &amp; Tourism.

In 2019 civil servants complained to senior managers that Ewing had bullied them. Speaking to journalists Ewing said: &quot;I completely reject all claims against me. A process is underway and that is entirely right and proper when such allegations are made. That process is at an early stage. I will make no further comment while that process is ongoing.&quot; The previous year Ewing apologised to an official for his &quot;forthright&quot; manner, after a bullying complaint was lodged against him.

=== Return to backbenches ===
After the 2021 election Ewing was replaced as a minister by Mairi Gougeon and became a backbencher. In a public letter to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Ewing revealed: &quot;In our discussion yesterday, you indicated that you will form a slimmed down cabinet. Obviously, you have had to make some tough decisions and we agreed that this meant I should now step out of Government.&quot;

In 2022 Ewing backed new oil and gas exploration and drilling projects in the North Sea, claiming that &quot;we need all oil and gas production we can get in the short and the medium term&quot;, and that &quot;the transition period away from hydrocarbons will last decades.&quot; Hence, he condemned the Scottish Greens, the SNP&#x27;s government partners, whose policies he described as &quot;somewhat extreme&quot;. On 20 April 2023, after a particularly robust intervention from Ewing on the subject of gas extraction, he was reminded officially about treating fellow members with respect by the Presiding Officer, which happened to be his sister, Annabelle Ewing. First Minister Humza Yousaf then quipped that he suspected it was not the first time she had had to tell her brother off.

Ewing voted against Green minister Lorna Slater in a no-confidence vote on 20 June 2023, making him the only SNP MSP to do so. It was reported the next day in the Herald and Scotsman that Ewing was set to lose the whip for this. Later that day, his mother, died age 93, hailed as a &quot;SNP political icon&quot;. Yousaf said publicly that Ewing would not lose the whip, despite his repeated public criticism of the party, but it was announced on 14 September that SNP MSPs would vote on disciplinary action against him. The SNP members voted to suspend him from the SNP Group for one week, but on 1 October he announced he would appeal the suspension. On 27 February Fergus Ewing lost the appeal and was suspended from the SNP.

==Personal life ==
Ewing married his first wife Margaret Ewing (then Margaret Bain) in 1983; she was the former MP for East Dunbartonshire (1974-79), and was elected to represent Moray in 1987. She held that seat until she stepped down in 2001, and represented the same area in the Scottish Parliament from 1999 until her death from breast cancer in March 2006. His sister, Annabelle Ewing, was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth until the 2005 general election and has been the MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife since 2011.

He is now in a relationship with Dr. Fiona Pearsall with whom he had a daughter in 2008.

<text>Jerome &quot;Jay&quot; Apt III (born April 28, 1949) is an American astronaut and professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Before becoming an astronaut, Apt was a physicist who worked on the Pioneer Venus 1978 space probe project, and used visible light and infrared techniques to study the planets and moons of the solar system from ground-based observatories.

==Biography==

Apt was a resident of Shadyside and graduated from Shady Side Academy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1967. He went on to attend Harvard University, earning a Bachelor of Arts in physics in 1971. He then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and earned a Doctor of Philosophy in physics in 1976. From 1976 to 1980 he was a staff member of the Center for Earth &amp; Planetary Physics at Harvard, and served as the Assistant Director of Harvard&#x27;s Division of Applied Sciences from 1978 to 1980. In 1980 he joined the Earth and Space Sciences Division of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as a scientist doing planetary research; he was science manager of the optical facilities at JPL&#x27;s Table Mountain Observatory. From 1982 through 1985 he was a flight controller responsible for Shuttle payload operations at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center. He worked in the mission control center on missions STS-7, STS-8, STS-41B, STS-41C, STS-41D, STS-41G, STS-51A, and STS-51D (the last four as Payload Officer). In 1985 he was selected as an astronaut candidate, and qualified to become an astronaut after a year of training. He has over 7,000 hours piloting aircraft, has flown on four space missions and has logged over 847 hours in space.

In 1991, Apt flew on the STS-37 mission aboard shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. He made two spacewalks with Jerry Ross, manually deploying the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory&#x27;s radio antenna when it failed to do so automatically; on the next day their second spacewalk tested hardware later used on the International Space Station. During the second Extra Vehicular Activity the palm-bar in Apt&#x27;s right glove punctured the suit. Apt&#x27;s hand conformed to the puncture, filling the hole before any noticeable depressurization could occur. Apt was unaware of the puncture until the glove was examined after the mission. Despite being partially exposed to vacuum he sustained only a minor scar. In 1992, Apt flew on STS-47 aboard shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; as the flight engineer, and commander of one of the two shifts in this round-the-clock mission. In 1994, Apt was again a shift commander of the first Space Radar Laboratory mission, STS-59 aboard shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. This lab studied the Earth. In 1996, Apt flew on STS-79 aboard shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; and visited the Russian Mir space station.

In 2003, Apt joined the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University where he is a Full Professor (emeritus) at the Tepper School of Business and the Department of Engineering and Public Policy. His research and teaching interests are in economics, engineering, and public policy aspects of the electricity industry, economics of technical innovation, management of technical enterprises, risk management in policy and technical decision framing, and engineering systems design. From 2000 through 2022 he and faculty member Granger Morgan directed the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center. He has supervised 23 Ph.D. students, 18 as sole advisor.

He is the author of the book &quot;Orbit: NASA Astronauts Photograph the Earth,&quot; published by the National Geographic Society. The book has been printed in eleven languages; more than 600,000 copies have been sold. His book &quot;Variable Renewable Energy and the Electricity Grid&quot; was published in 2014. He is the author of a large number of technical scientific publications. He received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1997 and the Metcalf Lifetime Achievement Award for significant contributions to engineering in 2002. His paper with PhD student Adam Newcomer, &quot;Near term implications of a ban on new coal-fired power plants in the US&quot; was cited as one of the top environmental policy papers of 2009 by the American Chemical Society. In 2012, the International Astronomical Union approved the name &quot;Jeromeapt&quot; for the main-belt asteroid 116903, as suggested by its discoverer, James Young. Apt is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

==Personal life==
Apt has two children.

<doc id="321868" wikidata="Q890803" url="?curid=321868" title="Bohlen–Pierce scale">
<text>The Bohlen–Pierce scale (BP scale) is a musical tuning and scale, first described in the 1970s, that offers an alternative to the octave-repeating scales typical in Western and other musics, specifically the equal-tempered diatonic scale.

The interval 3:1 (often called by a new name, tritave) serves as the fundamental harmonic ratio, replacing the diatonic scale&#x27;s 2:1 (the octave) with a perfect twelfth (an octave higher than a perfect fifth). For any pitch that is part of the BP scale, all pitches one or more tritaves higher or lower are part of the system as well, and are considered equivalent.

The BP scale divides the tritave into 13 steps, either equal tempered (the most popular form), or in a justly tuned version. Compared with octave-repeating scales, the BP scale&#x27;s intervals are more consonant with certain types of acoustic spectra.

The scale was independently described by Heinz Bohlen, Kees van Prooijen and John R. Pierce. Pierce, who, with Max Mathews and others, published his discovery in 1984, renamed the Pierce 3579b scale and its chromatic variant the &quot;Bohlen–Pierce scale&quot; after learning of Bohlen&#x27;s earlier publication. Bohlen had proposed the same scale based on consideration of the influence of combination tones on the Gestalt impression of intervals and chords.

The intervals between BP scale pitch classes are based on odd integer frequency ratios, in contrast with the intervals in diatonic scales, which employ both odd and even ratios found in the harmonic series. Specifically, the BP scale steps are based on ratios of integers whose factors are 3, 5, and 7. Thus the scale contains consonant harmonies based on the odd harmonic overtones 3:5:7:9 (). The chord formed by the ratio 3:5:7 () serves much the same role as the 4:5:6 chord (a major triad ) does in diatonic scales (3:5:7 = 1:: and 4:5:6 = 2::3 = 1::).

==Chords and modulation==
 intonation sensitivity pattern is similar to (the just major chord), more similar than that of the minor chord. This similarity suggests that our ears will also perceive 3:5:7 as consonant.

The 3:5:7 chord may thus be considered the major triad of the BP scale. It is approximated by an interval of 6 equal-tempered BP semitones () on bottom and an interval of 4 equal-tempered semitones on top ). A minor triad is correspondingly 6 semitones on top and 4 semitones on bottom ). 5:7:9 is the first inversion of the major triad ).

A study of chromatic triads formed from arbitrary combinations of the 13 tones of the chromatic scale among twelve musicians and twelve untrained listeners found to be the most dissonant chord (), but () was considered the most consonant by the trained subjects (because it sounds like an octave-dropped major triad) and () was judged most consonant by the untrained subjects.

Every tone of the Pierce 3579b scale is in a major and minor triad except for tone II of the scale. There are thirteen possible keys. Modulation is possible through changing a single note. Moving note II up one semitone causes the tonic to rise to what was note III (semitone 3), which therefore may be considered the dominant. One may consider VIII (semitone 10) the analogue of the subdominant.

==Timbre and the tritave==
3:1 serves as the fundamental harmonic ratio, replacing the diatonic scale&#x27;s 2:1 (the octave). () This interval is a perfect twelfth in diatonic nomenclature (perfect fifth when reduced by an octave), but as this terminology is based on step sizes and functions not used in the BP scale, it is often called by a new name, tritave (), in BP contexts, referring to its role as a pseudooctave, and using the prefix &quot;tri-&quot; (three) to distinguish it from the octave. In conventional scales, if a given pitch is part of the system, then all pitches one or more octaves higher or lower also are part of the system and, furthermore, are considered equivalent. In the BP scale, if a given pitch is present, then &quot;none&quot; of the pitches one or more octaves higher or lower are present, but &quot;all&quot; pitches one or more tritaves higher or lower are part of the system and are considered equivalent.

The BP scale&#x27;s use of odd integer ratios is appropriate for timbres containing only odd harmonics. Because the clarinet&#x27;s spectrum (in the chalumeau register) consists of primarily the odd harmonics, and the instrument overblows at the twelfth (or tritave) rather than the octave as most other woodwind instruments do, there is a natural affinity between it and the Bohlen–Pierce scale. At the suggestion of composer Georg Hajdu, clarinet maker Stephen Fox developed the first Bohlen–Pierce soprano clarinets and began offering them for sale in early 2006. He produced the first BP tenor clarinet (six steps below the soprano) in 2010 and the first epsilon clarinet (four steps above the soprano) in 2011. A contra clarinet (one tritave lower than the soprano) is now (2020) played by Nora Mueller, Luebeck, Germany.

A diatonic Bohlen–Pierce scale may be constructed with the following just ratios (chart shows the &quot;Lambda&quot; (λ) scale):


A just BP scale may be constructed from four overlapping 3:5:7 chords, for example, V, II, VI, and IV, though different chords may be chosen to produce a similar scale:
 (5:3)(7:5)
 V IX III
 III VII I
 VI I IV
 IV VIII II

==Bohlen–Pierce temperament==
Bohlen originally expressed the BP scale in both just intonation and equal temperament. The tempered form, which divides the tritave into thirteen equal steps, has become the most popular form. Each step is = 3 = 1.08818… above the next, or 1200 log2 (3) = 146.3… cents per step. The octave is divided into a fractional number of steps. Twelve equally tempered steps per octave are used in 12-tet. The Bohlen–Pierce scale could be described as 8.202087-tet, because a full octave (1200 cents), divided by 146.3… cents per step, gives 8.202087 steps per octave.

Dividing the tritave into 13 equal steps tempers out, or reduces to a unison, both of the intervals 245:243 (about 14 cents, sometimes called the minor Bohlen–Pierce diesis) and 3125:3087 (about 21 cents, sometimes called the major Bohlen–Pierce diesis) in the same way that dividing the octave into 12 equal steps reduces both 81:80 (syntonic comma) and 128:125 (5-limit limma) to a unison. A 7-limit linear temperament tempers out both of these intervals; the resulting &quot;Bohlen–Pierce temperament&quot; no longer has anything to do with tritave equivalences or non-octave scales, beyond the fact that it is well adapted to using them. A tuning of 41 equal steps to the octave ( = 29.27 cents per step) would be quite logical for this temperament. In such a tuning, a tempered perfect twelfth (1902.4 cents, about a half cent larger than a just twelfth) is divided into 65 equal steps, resulting in a seeming paradox: Taking every fifth degree of this octave-based scale yields an excellent approximation to the non-octave-based equally tempered BP scale. Furthermore, an interval of five such steps generates (octave-based) MOSes (moments of symmetry) with 8, 9, or 17 notes, and the 8-note scale (comprising degrees 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 of the 41-equal scale) could be considered the octave-equivalent version of the Bohlen–Pierce scale.

==Intervals and scale diagrams==
The following are the thirteen notes in the scale (cents rounded to nearest whole number):

==Music and composition==
What does music using a Bohlen–Pierce scale sound like, aesthetically? Dave Benson suggests it helps to use only sounds with only odd harmonics, including clarinets or synthesized tones, but argues that because &quot;some of the intervals sound a bit like intervals in [the more familiar] twelve-tone scale, but badly out of tune&quot;, the average listener will continually feel &quot;that something isn&#x27;t quite right&quot;, due to social conditioning.

Mathews and Pierce conclude that clear and memorable melodies may be composed in the BP scale, that &quot;counterpoint sounds all right&quot;, and that &quot;chordal passages sound like harmony&quot;, presumably meaning progression, &quot;but without any great tension or sense of resolution&quot;. In their 1989 study of consonance judgment, both intervals of the five chords rated most consonant by trained musicians are approximately diatonic intervals, suggesting that their training influenced their selection and that similar experience with the BP scale would similarly influence their choices.

Compositions using the Bohlen–Pierce scale include &quot;Purity&quot;, the first movement of Curtis Roads&#x27; &quot;Clang-Tint&quot;. Other computer composers to use the BP scale include Jon Appleton, Richard Boulanger (&quot;Solemn Song for Evening&quot; (1990)), Georg Hajdu, Juan Reyes&#x27; &quot;ppP&quot; (1999-2000), Ami Radunskaya&#x27;s &quot;A Wild and Reckless Place&quot; (1990), Charles Carpenter (&quot;Frog à la Pêche&quot; (1994) &amp; &quot;Splat&quot;), and Elaine Walker (&quot;Stick Men&quot; (1991), &quot;Love Song&quot;, and &quot;Greater Good&quot; (2011)).

David Lieberman, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Toronto, directed the development of a &quot;Stredici&quot;, a string instrument tuned to the Bohlen–Pierce scale. The five-meter long instrument was used in concerts in Boston in 2012.

==Symposium==
A first Bohlen–Pierce symposium took place in Boston on March 7 to 9, 2010, produced by composer Georg Hajdu (Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg) and the Boston Microtonal Society. Co-organizers were the Boston Goethe Institute, the Berklee College of Music, the Northeastern University and the New England Conservatory of Music. The symposium participants, which included Heinz Bohlen, Max Mathews, Clarence Barlow, Curtis Roads, David Wessel, Psyche Loui, Richard Boulanger, Georg Hajdu, Paul Erlich, Ron Sword, Julia Werntz, Larry Polansky, Manfred Stahnke, Stephen Fox, Elaine Walker, Todd Harrop, Gayle Young, Johannes Kretz, Arturo Grolimund, Kevin Foster, presented 20 papers on history and properties of the Bohlen–Pierce scale, performed more than 40 compositions in the novel system and introduced several new musical instruments.
Performers included German musicians Nora-Louise Müller and Ákos Hoffman on Bohlen–Pierce clarinets and Arturo Grolimund on Bohlen–Pierce pan flute as well as Canadian ensemble tranSpectra, and US American xenharmonic band ZIA, led by Elaine Walker.

==Other unusual tunings or scales==
Other non-octave tunings investigated by Bohlen include twelve steps in the tritave, named A12 by Enrique Moreno and based on the 4:7:10 chord , seven steps in the octave (7-tet) or similar 11 steps in the tritave, and eight steps in the octave, based on 5:7:9 and of which only the just version would be used. Additionally, the pentave can be divided into eight steps which approximates chords of the form 5:9:13:17:21:25. The Bohlen 833 cents scale is based on the Fibonacci sequence, although it was created from combination tones, and contains a complex network of harmonic relations due to the inclusion of coinciding harmonics of stacked 833 cent intervals. For example, &quot;step 10 turns out to be identical with the octave (1200 cents) to the base tone, at the same time featuring the Golden Ratio to step 3&quot;.

Alternate scales may be specified by indicating the size of equal tempered steps, for example Wendy Carlos&#x27; 78-cent alpha scale and 63.8-cent beta scale, and Gary Morrison&#x27;s 88-cent scale (13.64 steps per octave or 14 per 1232-cent stretched octave). This gives the alpha scale 15.39 steps per octave and the beta scale 18.75 steps per octave.

===Expansions===
====39-tone equal division of the tritave====
Paul Erlich proposed dividing each step of the Bohlen–Pierce into thirds so that the tritave is divided into 39 equal steps instead of 13 equal steps. The scale, which can be viewed as three evenly staggered Bohlen-Pierce scales, gives additional odd harmonics. The 13-step scale hits the odd harmonics 3:1; 5:3, 7:3; 7:5, 9:5; 9:7, and 15:7; while the 39-step scale includes all of those and many more (11:5, 13:5; 11:7, 13:7; 11:9, 13:9; 13:11, 15:11, 21:11, 25:11, 27:11; 15:13, 21:13, 25:13, 27:13, 33:13, and 35:13), while still missing almost all of the even harmonics (including 2:1; 3:2, 5:2; 4:3, 8:3; 6:5, 8:5; 9:8, 11:8, 13:8, and 15:8). The size of this scale is about 25 equal steps to a ratio slightly larger than an octave, so each of the 39 equal steps is slightly smaller than half of one of the 12 equal steps of the standard scale.
====65-tone equal division of the tritave====
Dividing each step of the Bohlen–Pierce scale into fifths (so that the tritave is divided into 65 steps) results in a very accurate octave (41 steps) and perfect fifth (24 steps), as well as approximations for other just intervals. The scale is practically identical to 41-tone equal division of the octave except that each step is slightly smaller (less than a hundredth of a cent per step).

<doc id="321869" wikidata="Q602136" url="?curid=321869" title="Coding theory">
<text>Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their respective fitness for specific applications. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, data transmission and data storage. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines—such as information theory, electrical engineering, mathematics, linguistics, and computer science—for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction or detection of errors in the transmitted data.

There are four types of coding:

# Data compression (or &quot;source coding&quot;)
# Error control (or &quot;channel coding&quot;)
# Cryptographic coding
# Line coding

Data compression attempts to remove unwanted redundancy from the data from a source in order to transmit it more efficiently. For example, DEFLATE data compression makes files smaller, for purposes such as to reduce Internet traffic. Data compression and error correction may be studied in combination.

Error correction adds useful redundancy to the data from a source to make the transmission more robust to disturbances present on the transmission channel. The ordinary user may not be aware of many applications using error correction. A typical music compact disc (CD) uses the Reed–Solomon code to correct for scratches and dust. In this application the transmission channel is the CD itself. Cell phones also use coding techniques to correct for the fading and noise of high frequency radio transmission. Data modems, telephone transmissions, and the NASA Deep Space Network all employ channel coding techniques to get the bits through, for example the turbo code and LDPC codes.

==History of coding theory==
In 1948, Claude Shannon published &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the &quot;Bell System Technical Journal&quot;. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the information a sender wants to transmit. In this fundamental work he used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener, which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.

The binary Golay code was developed in 1949. It is an error-correcting code capable of correcting up to three errors in each 24-bit word, and detecting a fourth.

Richard Hamming won the Turing Award in 1968 for his work at Bell Labs in numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes. He invented the concepts known as Hamming codes, Hamming windows, Hamming numbers, and Hamming distance.

In 1972, Nasir Ahmed proposed the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which he developed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1973. The DCT is the most widely used lossy compression algorithm, the basis for multimedia formats such as JPEG, MPEG and MP3.

==Source coding==
The aim of source coding is to take the source data and make it smaller.

===Definition===
Data can be seen as a random variable formula_1, where formula_2 appears with probability formula_3.

Data are encoded by strings (words) over an alphabet formula_4.

A code is a function

:formula_5 (or formula_6 if the empty string is not part of the alphabet).

formula_7 is the code word associated with formula_8.

Length of the code word is written as

:formula_9

Expected length of a code is

:formula_10

The concatenation of code words formula_11.

The code word of the empty string is the empty string itself:

:formula_12

===Properties===
# formula_5 is non-singular if injective.
# formula_14 is uniquely decodable if injective.
# formula_5 is instantaneous if formula_16 is not a proper prefix of formula_17 (and vice versa).

===Principle===
Entropy of a source is the measure of information. Basically, source codes try to reduce the redundancy present in the source, and represent the source with fewer bits that carry more information.

Data compression which explicitly tries to minimize the average length of messages according to a particular assumed probability model is called entropy encoding.

Various techniques used by source coding schemes try to achieve the limit of entropy of the source. &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≥ &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), where &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is entropy of source (bitrate), and &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the bitrate after compression. In particular, no source coding scheme can be better than the entropy of the source.

===Example===
Facsimile transmission uses a simple run length code. Source coding removes all data superfluous to the need of the transmitter, decreasing the bandwidth required for transmission.

==Channel coding==
The purpose of channel coding theory is to find codes which transmit quickly, contain many valid code words and can correct or at least detect many errors. While not mutually exclusive, performance in these areas is a trade-off. So, different codes are optimal for different applications. The needed properties of this code mainly depend on the probability of errors happening during transmission. In a typical CD, the impairment is mainly dust or scratches.

CDs use cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding to spread the data out over the disk.

Although not a very good code, a simple repeat code can serve as an understandable example. Suppose we take a block of data bits (representing sound) and send it three times. At the receiver we will examine the three repetitions bit by bit and take a majority vote. The twist on this is that we do not merely send the bits in order. We interleave them. The block of data bits is first divided into 4 smaller blocks. Then we cycle through the block and send one bit from the first, then the second, etc. This is done three times to spread the data out over the surface of the disk. In the context of the simple repeat code, this may not appear effective. However, there are more powerful codes known which are very effective at correcting the &quot;burst&quot; error of a scratch or a dust spot when this interleaving technique is used.

Other codes are more appropriate for different applications. Deep space communications are limited by the thermal noise of the receiver which is more of a continuous nature than a bursty nature. Likewise, narrowband modems are limited by the noise, present in the telephone network and also modeled better as a continuous disturbance. Cell phones are subject to rapid fading. The high frequencies used can cause rapid fading of the signal even if the receiver is moved a few inches. Again there are a class of channel codes that are designed to combat fading.

===Linear codes===

The term algebraic coding theory denotes the sub-field of coding theory where the properties of codes are expressed in algebraic terms and then further researched.

Algebraic coding theory is basically divided into two major types of codes:

* Linear block codes
* Convolutional codes

It analyzes the following three properties of a code – mainly:

* Code word length
* Total number of valid code words
* The minimum distance between two valid code words, using mainly the Hamming distance, sometimes also other distances like the Lee distance

====Linear block codes====
Linear block codes have the property of linearity, i.e. the sum of any two codewords is also a code word, and they are applied to the source bits in blocks, hence the name linear block codes. There are block codes that are not linear, but it is difficult to prove that a code is a good one without this property.

Linear block codes are summarized by their symbol alphabets (e.g., binary or ternary) and parameters (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot;,&quot;dmin&quot;) where

# n is the length of the codeword, in symbols,
# m is the number of source symbols that will be used for encoding at once,
# &quot;dmin&quot; is the minimum hamming distance for the code.

There are many types of linear block codes, such as

# Cyclic codes (e.g., Hamming codes)
# Repetition codes
# Parity codes
# Polynomial codes (e.g., BCH codes)
# Reed–Solomon codes
# Algebraic geometric codes
# Reed–Muller codes
# Perfect codes
# Locally recoverable code

Block codes are tied to the sphere packing problem, which has received some attention over the years. In two dimensions, it is easy to visualize. Take a bunch of pennies flat on the table and push them together. The result is a hexagon pattern like a bee&#x27;s nest. But block codes rely on more dimensions which cannot easily be visualized. The powerful (24,12) Golay code used in deep space communications uses 24 dimensions. If used as a binary code (which it usually is) the dimensions refer to the length of the codeword as defined above.

The theory of coding uses the &quot;N&quot;-dimensional sphere model. For example, how many pennies can be packed into a circle on a tabletop, or in 3 dimensions, how many marbles can be packed into a globe. Other considerations enter the choice of a code. For example, hexagon packing into the constraint of a rectangular box will leave empty space at the corners. As the dimensions get larger, the percentage of empty space grows smaller. But at certain dimensions, the packing uses all the space and these codes are the so-called &quot;perfect&quot; codes. The only nontrivial and useful perfect codes are the distance-3 Hamming codes with parameters satisfying (2&quot;r&quot; – 1, 2&quot;r&quot; – 1 – &quot;r&quot;, 3), and the [23,12,7] binary and [11,6,5] ternary Golay codes.

Another code property is the number of neighbors that a single codeword may have.
Again, consider pennies as an example. First we pack the pennies in a rectangular grid. Each penny will have 4 near neighbors (and 4 at the corners which are farther away). In a hexagon, each penny will have 6 near neighbors. When we increase the dimensions, the number of near neighbors increases very rapidly. The result is the number of ways for noise to make the receiver choose a neighbor (hence an error) grows as well. This is a fundamental limitation of block codes, and indeed all codes. It may be harder to cause an error to a single neighbor, but the number of neighbors can be large enough so the total error probability actually suffers.

Properties of linear block codes are used in many applications. For example, the syndrome-coset uniqueness property of linear block codes is used in trellis shaping, one of the best-known shaping codes.

====Convolutional codes====
The idea behind a convolutional code is to make every codeword symbol be the weighted sum of the various input message symbols. This is like convolution used in LTI systems to find the output of a system, when you know the input and impulse response.

So we generally find the output of the system convolutional encoder, which is the convolution of the input bit, against the states of the convolution encoder, registers.

Fundamentally, convolutional codes do not offer more protection against noise than an equivalent block code. In many cases, they generally offer greater simplicity of implementation over a block code of equal power. The encoder is usually a simple circuit which has state memory and some feedback logic, normally XOR gates. The decoder can be implemented in software or firmware.

The Viterbi algorithm is the optimum algorithm used to decode convolutional codes. There are simplifications to reduce the computational load. They rely on searching only the most likely paths. Although not optimum, they have generally been found to give good results in low noise environments.

Convolutional codes are used in voiceband modems (V.32, V.17, V.34) and in GSM mobile phones, as well as satellite and military communication devices.

==Cryptographic coding==

Cryptography or cryptographic coding is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties (called adversaries). More generally, it is about constructing and analyzing protocols that block adversaries; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.

Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with &quot;encryption&quot;, the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted persons from doing the same. Since World War I and the advent of the computer, the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread.

Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the one-time pad—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.

==Line coding==
A line code (also called digital baseband modulation or digital baseband transmission method) is a code chosen for use within a communications system for baseband transmission purposes. Line coding is often used for digital data transport.

Line coding consists of representing the digital signal to be transported by an amplitude- and time-discrete signal that is optimally tuned for the specific properties of the physical channel (and of the receiving equipment). The waveform pattern of voltage or current used to represent the 1s and 0s of a digital data on a transmission link is called &quot;line encoding&quot;. The common types of line encoding are unipolar, polar, bipolar, and Manchester encoding.

==Other applications of coding theory==
Another concern of coding theory is designing codes that help synchronization. A code may be designed so that a phase shift can be easily detected and corrected and that multiple signals can be sent on the same channel.

Another application of codes, used in some mobile phone systems, is code-division multiple access (CDMA). Each phone is assigned a code sequence that is approximately uncorrelated with the codes of other phones. When transmitting, the code word is used to modulate the data bits representing the voice message. At the receiver, a demodulation process is performed to recover the data. The properties of this class of codes allow many users (with different codes) to use the same radio channel at the same time. To the receiver, the signals of other users will appear to the demodulator only as a low-level noise.

Another general class of codes are the automatic repeat-request (ARQ) codes. In these codes the sender adds redundancy to each message for error checking, usually by adding check bits. If the check bits are not consistent with the rest of the message when it arrives, the receiver will ask the sender to retransmit the message. All but the simplest wide area network protocols use ARQ. Common protocols include SDLC (IBM), TCP (Internet), X.25 (International) and many others. There is an extensive field of research on this topic because of the problem of matching a rejected packet against a new packet. Is it a new one or is it a retransmission? Typically numbering schemes are used, as in TCP.

===Group testing===
Group testing uses codes in a different way. Consider a large group of items in which a very few are different in a particular way (e.g., defective products or infected test subjects). The idea of group testing is to determine which items are &quot;different&quot; by using as few tests as possible. The origin of the problem has its roots in the Second World War when the United States Army Air Forces needed to test its soldiers for syphilis.

===Analog coding===
Information is encoded analogously in the neural networks of brains, in analog signal processing, and analog electronics. Aspects of analog coding include analog error correction,
analog data compression and analog encryption.

==Neural coding==
Neural coding is a neuroscience-related field concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by networks of neurons. The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationship among electrical activity of the neurons in the ensemble. It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information, and that neurons follow the principles of information theory and compress information, and detect and correct
errors in the signals that are sent throughout the brain and wider nervous system.

<doc id="321874" wikidata="Q7254438" url="?curid=321874" title="Pseudo-octave">
<text>A pseudo-octave, pseudooctave,
or paradoxical octave
in music is an interval whose frequency ratio is not exactly expected for perfectly harmonic pitches, but slightly wider or narrower in pitch – for example 1.98:1, 2.01:1, or even as large as 2.3:1 . The pseudo-octave is never-the-less perceived as if it were equivalent to the conventional 2:1 harmonic ratio, and consequently is treated the same: Pitches separated by a pseudo-octave appropriate for a given instrument are considered equivalent to each other just as with normal &quot;pitch classes&quot; (which are typically explained only in terms of the idealized 2:1 octave).

==Stretched octave==
The stretched octave, for example rather than (an 8.6 cent pitch difference), sounds &quot;out of tune&quot; when played with ideal harmonic overtones, but &quot;in tune&quot; when played with lower notes whose overtones are themselves naturally stretched by an equivalent amount.

In piano tuning, stretched octaves are commonly encountered in instruments where string thickness and high string tension causes some strings to approach their elastic limit, which makes the string respond to stretching and bending with a pull to restore its original shape and position a little out of proportion to how far it was bent or stretched. That non-linearity causes small differences between the string&#x27;s real overtone frequencies and the mathematically ideal simple harmonic oscillator&#x27;s integer multiple harmonics. The so-named &quot;piano-tuners&#x27; octave&quot; used to compensate for the non-harmonic partials is well approximated by the &quot;Railsback curve&quot; (which see).

The effect of strings&#x27; small inelastic response is that rather than the simple harmonics expected for its overtone series, which would all be integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, the timbre of the note that the string actually produces has slightly inharmonic overtones. In detailed discussions of pitch and tuning the actual overtones in the sounded note are called &quot;partial tones&quot; or &quot;partials&quot;, in order to avoid confusing them with the more familiar, mathematically simple integer harmonics; both are often relevant in the same sentence. Partials measured in the sounds produced by real musical instruments almost always have a slightly higher pitch than the corresponding idealized harmonic, with the discrepancy being less important for high-pitched instruments (above whose high-level overtones fall above the range of human hearing.

The practical consequence of the discrepancy between the sharpened pitches in a bass note&#x27;s overtone series that treble notes must match, makes it necessary to widen every interval very slightly. Generally, it&#x27;s more than sufficient to sharpen only whole octaves slightly, rather than separately modifying all intervals that reach individual pitches in the upper octaves (&quot;see&quot; stretched tuning).

The octaves of Balinese gamelans are never tuned 2:1, but instead are stretched or compressed in a consistent manner throughout the range of each individual gamelan, due to the physical characteristics of their instruments. Another example is the tritave of the Bohlen–Pierce scale (3:1).

Octave stretching is less apparent on large pianos which have longer strings and hence less curvature for a given displacement; that is one reason why orchestras go to the expense of using very long concert grand pianos rather than shorter, less expensive baby grand, upright, or spinet pianos. (Another reason is that long strings under high tension can store more acoustic energy than can short strings, making larger instruments louder (hence making a single piano better able to be perceived over the volume of an entire orchestra) and giving them longer sustain than similar, smaller instruments.)

<text>Doon de Mayence also known as Doolin de Maience, Doon de Maience or Doolin de Mayence was a fictional hero of the Old French &quot;chansons de geste&quot;, who gives his name to the third cycle of the Charlemagne romances dealing with the feudal revolts.

There is no single unifying theme in the &quot;geste&quot; of Doon de Mayence. The rebellious barons are connected by the poets with Doon by fictitious genealogical ties and all are represented as opposing Charlemagne, although their adventures—insofar as they possess a historical basis—generally occur before (or after) his reign.

The general insolence of their attitude to the sovereign suggests that Charlemagne is here only a pseudonym for his weaker successors. The tradition of a traitorous family of Mayence (Mainz), which was developed in Italy into a series of stories about criminals, appeared later than the Carolingian cycle. A contributor to the Chronicle of Fredegar states (iv. 87) that the army of Sigebert III was betrayed from within its own ranks by men of Mayence, in a battle fought with Radulf on the banks of the Unstrut in Thuringia.

The chief heroes of the poems which make up Doon de Mayence are Ogier the Dane, the four sons of Aymon, and Huon of Bordeaux. Doon himself was probably one of the last characters to be clearly defined, and the &quot;chanson de geste&quot; relating his exploits was drawn up partly with the view of supplying a suitable ancestor for the other heroes—in modern terms, a prequel. The second half of the poem, detailing Doon’s wars in Saxony, is perhaps based on historical events but the first half, a separate romance dealing with his romantic childhood, is a fiction dating back to the 13th century. Doon had twelve sons, of whom the most noteworthy are:
* Gaufrey de Danemarche, the father of Ogier the Dane
* Doon de Nanteuil, whose son Gamier married the beautiful Aye d’Avignon
* Griffon d’Hauteville, father of the arch-traitor Ganelon
* Duke Aymon de Dordone, whose four sons (including Renaud de Montauban) were relentlessly pursued by Charles
* Beuves d’Aigremont, whose sons were the enchanter Maugris and Vivien de Monbranc
* Sevin (or Seguin), the father of Huon of Bordeaux
* Girart de Roussillon, hero, married to Bertha, opponent of Charles
* Others, less renowned

The history of these figures is given in &quot;Doon de Mayence&quot;, &quot;Gaufrey&quot;, the romances relating to Ogier, &quot;Aye d’Avignon&quot;, the fragmentary &quot;Doon de Nanteuil&quot;, &quot;Gui de Nanteuil&quot;, &quot;Tristan de Nanteuil&quot;, &quot;Parise la Duchesse&quot;, &quot;Maugis d’Aigremont&quot;, &quot;Vivien l’amachour de Monbranc&quot;, &quot;Renaus de Montauban&quot; (or &quot;Les Quatre Fils Aymon&quot;) and &quot;Huon de Bordeaux&quot;.

<doc id="321887" wikidata="Q675788" url="?curid=321887" title="Ogier the Dane">
<text>Ogier the Dane (; ) is a legendary paladin of Charlemagne who appears in many Old French &quot;chansons de geste&quot;. In particular, he features as the protagonist in &quot;La Chevalerie Ogier&quot; (), which belongs to the &quot;Geste de Doon de Mayence&quot; (&quot;cycle of the rebellious vassals&quot;; Doon is Ogier&#x27;s grandfather). The first part of this epic, the &quot;enfance&quot;[&quot;s&quot;] (childhood exploits) of Ogier, is marked by his duel against a Saracen from whom he obtains the sword Cortain, followed by victory over another Saracen opponent from whom he wins the horse Broiefort. In subsequent parts, Ogier turns into a rebel with cause, seeking refuge with the King of Lombardy and warring with Charlemagne for many years, until he is eventually reconciled when a dire need for him emerges after another Saracen incursion.

His character is a composite based on an historical Autcharius Francus who was aligned with king Desiderius of Lombardy against Charlemagne. The legend of a certain Othgerius buried in Meaux is also incorporated into the &quot;Chevalerie&quot;. 

In Scandinavia, he was first known as Oddgeir danski in the Old Norse prose translation &quot;Karlamagnús saga&quot;, but later became more widely known as Holger Danske, and was given the pedigree of being Olaf son of King Gøtrik in a 16th-century Danish translation. Since then, Holger Danske has become a Danish folklore hero, with a sleeping hero motif attached to him, and eventually a symbol of Danish identity and patriotism as well as anti-German nationalism.

== Historical references ==
The Ogier character is generally believed to be based on Autcharius/Otker, a Frankish knight who had served Carloman and escorted his widow and young children to Desiderius, King of Lombardy, but eventually surrendered to Charlemagne. The Ogier character could also have been partly constructed from the historical Adalgis (or Adelgis, Algisus), son of Desiderius, who played a similar role. The &quot;chanson de geste&quot; does parallel this, and Ogier does seek refuge with the Lombardian king Didier or Désier (as Desiderius is styled in French).

An unrelated Othgerius (Otgerius), a benefactor buried at the Abbey of Saint Faro in Meaux in France, became connected with Ogier by a work called &quot;Conversio Othgeri militis&quot; (ca. 1070–1080) written by the monks there. This tradition is reflected in the &quot;chanson&quot; of Ogier, which states that the hero was buried at Meaux.

There is no Ogier of consequence in Danish history; at least, no Ogier as such appears in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. However, the Danish work &quot;Holger Danskes Krønike&quot; (1534) made Ogier into the son of King Gøtrek of Denmark (namely Olaf son of Gøtrek, mentioned by Saxo). &quot;Olgerus, dux Daniæ&quot; (&quot;Olger, War-Leader of the Danes&quot;) had rebuilt the St. Martin&#x27;s monastery pillaged by the Saxons in 778, according to the chronicle of this monastery at Cologne (ca. 1050). However, this is not a contemporary record and may just be poetic fiction.

== The legend in France ==
Ogier the Dane&#x27;s first appearance (spelled &quot;Oger&quot;) in any work is in &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; (c. 1060), where he is not named as one of the douzepers (twelve peers or paladins) of Charlemagne, although he is usually one of the twelve peers in other works. In the poeticized Battle of Roncevaux Pass, Ogier is assigned to be the vanguard and commands the Bavarian Army in the battle against Baligant in the later half. He plays only a minor part in this poem, and it is unclear what becomes of him, but the &quot;Pseudo-Turpin&quot; knows of a tradition that Ogier was killed at Roncevaux.

A full career of Ogier from youth to death is treated in &quot;La Chevalerie Ogier de Danemarche&quot;, a 13th-century assonanced poem of approximately 13,000 lines, attributed to Raimbert de Paris, preserved in six manuscripts. It relates Ogier&#x27;s early years, his rebellion against Charlemagne and eventual reconciliation. This is now considered a retelling. Ogier in a lost original &quot;&quot;Chevalerie Ogier&quot; primitive&quot; is thought to have fought alongside the Lombards because Charlemagne attacked at the Pope&#x27;s bidding, as historically happened in the Siege of Pavia (773–74), that is, there was no fighting with the Saracens (i.e. Muslims) as a prelude to this.

The legend that Ogier fought valiantly with some Saracens in his youth is the chief material of the first branch (about 3,000 lines) of Raimbert&#x27;s &quot;Chevalerie Ogier&quot;. This is also recounted in &quot;Enfances Ogier&quot; (c. 1270), a rhymed poem of 9,229 lines by Adenet le Roi. The story of Ogier&#x27;s youth develops with close similarity in these two works starting at the beginning, but they diverge at a certain point when Raimbert&#x27;s version begins to be more economical with the details.

In the 14th-century and subsequent versions of the romance, Ogier travels to the Avalon ruled by King Arthur and eventually becomes paramour of Morgan le Fay (the earliest known mention of her as his lover is in &quot;Brun de la Montaigne&quot;). This is how the story culminates in &quot;Roman d&#x27;Ogier&quot;, a reworking in s written in the 14th century, as well as its prose redaction retitled &quot;Ogier le Danois&quot; (&quot;Ogyer le Danois&quot;) printed in a number of editions from the late 15th century onwards. The Alexandrines version may contain some vestiges of the lost 12th-century &quot;Chevalerie Ogier&quot;. It is also possible that Ogier the Dane has first appeared in the Arthurian context as the Saxon prince Oriolz the Dane (de Danemarche), sometimes known as the Red Knight, in the 13th-century Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot; and its English adaptation &quot;Arthour and Merlin&quot;.

There are also several texts that might be classed as &quot;histories&quot; which refer to Ogier. Girart d&#x27;Amiens&#x27; &quot;Charlemagne&quot; contains a variant of Ogier&#x27;s &quot;enfances&quot;. Philippe Mouskes&#x27;s &quot;Chronique rimée&quot; (c. 1243) writes on Ogier&#x27;s death. Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse&#x27;s &quot;Ly Myreur des Histors&quot; writes of Ogier&#x27;s combat with the &quot;capalus&quot; (chapalu), which is a giant cat monster known from the Arthurian cycle. 

=== Legend at Meaux ===

A legend of &quot;Conversio Othgeri militis&quot; was invented by the monks at the abbey of Saint Faro at Meaux around 1070–1080. It claimed Othgerius Francus (&quot;Frankish&quot;) to be the most illustrious member of Charlemagne&#x27;s court after the king himself, thus making him identifiable with Ogier the Dane. He was buried in the abbey in a mausoleum built for him. His remains were placed in a sarcophagus lidded with his recumbent tomb effigy lying next to that of Saint Benedictus, and the chamber was enshrined with erect statues of various figures from the Charlemagne Cycle. A stone head later found in Meaux was determined to be Ogier&#x27;s head from comparisons with these incunabula etchings. This stone head can still be viewed today.

This document was first commented on by Jean Mabillon in his &quot;Acta Sanctorum Ordinis S. Benedicti&quot;, printed editions of which include a detailed illustration of the mausoleum at St. Faro. The statues at the mausoleum even included la belle Aude, affianced to Roland, with one of the inscriptions there (according to Mabillon) claiming that Aude was Ogier&#x27;s sister. It underwent restoration in 1535 by the Italian Gabriele Simeoni. That mausoleum is no longer preserved, but an illustration of the interior was printed in editions of Mabillon&#x27;s &quot;Acta Sanctorum Ordinis S. Benedicti&quot;.

===&quot;Chevalerie Ogier&quot;===
Ogier is the main character in the poem &quot;La Chevalerie Ogier de Danemarche&quot; (written –1215). The work consists of twelve parts (or &quot;branches&quot;) of varying lengths.

In the first branch of the poem (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Les enfances Ogier&quot; portion), Ogier is introduced as the son of Geoffroy de Danemarche (while Geoffroy, in turn, is son of Doon de Mayence according to other works). Ogier is surrendered as a hostage to Charlemagne, but at the castle where he is kept, he becomes intimate with the castellan&#x27;s daughter, who bears him a son, named Baldwinet (, dim. of ).

When Charles (Charlemagne), at the Pope&#x27;s request, launches a war campaign against Saracens invading Rome, Ogier is there initially as an unarmed bystander. But when the French suffer a setback, Ogier joins the fray, seizing a flag and arms from a fleeing standard-bearer. For his deeds, Ogier is knighted by Charlemagne and is girt with the king&#x27;s own sword. Next, Ogier accepts the challenge of single combat from the Saracen warrior Karaheut of India, but enemies interrupt and abduct Ogier. Karaheut protests for Ogier&#x27;s release, to no avail, and loses his engagement to the amiral&#x27;s daughter. The amiral then decides his daughter should marry the brutish warrior Brunamont of Maiolgre (Mallorca), but she is unwilling, and appoints the captured Ogier as her champion to fight on her behalf. Ogier, armed with Karaheut&#x27;s sword Cortain (or Corte, Cortana, etc.), vanquishes Brunamont and confiscates the horse Broiefort.

In the second branch, Ogier&#x27;s son Bauduinet (Baldwinet) is slain by Charlot over a game of chess. Ogier attacks Charlot and demands his life in revenge, resulting in his banishment. Ogier is given safe haven by King Didier of Pavia in Lombardy. Ogier strengthens the fortifications at Castelfort (Chastel Fort) and Mont Quevrel in Lombardy. In the subsequent branches, Ogier wars with Charlemagne (alone, after losing his squire Benoit/Bennet), enduring for seven years, then is taken prisoner for another seven years. In the ninth branch, renewed attack by the Saracens forces Charlemagne to seek Ogier&#x27;s help, and Ogier, reunited with his old war horse, slays the giant, King Brehus (or Brahier, Braihier, Bruhier) of Africa. 

In the concluding branches (XI and XII), Ogier engages in a warring adventure in England, and marries the English princess whom he succors. He is granted Hainaut Province and Province of Brabant (now in Belgium) by Charlemagne. Ogier and his squire Benoit/Bennet are interred at Meaux.

=== &quot;Roman d&#x27;Ogier&quot; ===
Modified verse versions were produced in the 14th century. The decasyllabic &quot;Roman d&#x27;Ogier&quot; appeared (31000vv., early 14th cent. or c. 1310) which contained an ending plot where Ogier is invited to Avalon by Morgue la Fee (Morgan le Fay). Later an Alexandrine (dodecasyllabic) &quot;Roman d&#x27;Ogier&quot; (29000vv., mid-14th cent. or c. 1335 ) of 29,000 verses, appeared, datable to c. 1335, extant in three manuscript redactions, and this too expanded upon the &quot;Chevalerie&quot; of Raimbert, by adding an Avalon adventure (about 18,000 verses).

The Alexandrine version represented fan intermediate stage between the decasyllabic romance and the later prose rendering. In the Alexandrine version, Ogier&#x27;s fate with Morgan is set in motion while he is still a newborn in his crib. Six s visit the baby, each with a gift, and Morgan&#x27;s gift is longevity and life living with her. Ogier has an enhanced career, even becoming King of England, and when he reaches the age of 100, he is shipwrecked by Morgan so he can be conveyed to Avalon. He returns after two hundred years to save France, and is given a firebrand which must not be allowed to be burnt down for him to remain alive. Ogier tries to forfeit his life after accomplishing his task but is saved by Morgan.

In the further development of the legend, Ogier and Morgan have a son named Meurvin (or Marlyn). The latter himself became the subject of a lengthy Renaissance era romance, the &quot;Histoire du Preux et Vaillant Chevalier Meurvin&quot; (1540). Meurvin&#x27;s story makes Ogier an ancestor of Godfrey of Bouillon, the historical crusader king of Jerusalem.

== The legend in Scandinavia ==
The early form of the &quot;chanson de geste&quot; was translated in the 13th century into Old Norse as &quot;Oddgeirs þáttr danska&quot; (&quot;Short story of Oddgeir danski&quot;), Branch III of the &quot;Karlamagnús saga&quot; (c. 1240). An Old Danish version of it, &quot;Karl Magnus krønike&quot;, was later created (some copies date to 1480).

The 16th-century &quot;Olger Danskes krønike&quot; was a Danish translation of the French prose romance &quot;Ogier le Danois&quot; by Kristiern Pedersen, started while in Paris in 1514–1515, probably completed during his second sojourn in 1527, and printed in 1534 in Malmö. Pedersen also fused the romance with Danish genealogy, thus making Ogier the son of Danish king Gøtrik (Godfred).

&quot;Holger Danske og Burmand&quot; (DgF 30, TSB E 133) recounts the fight between the hero and Burmand. The ballad also exists in Swedish (SMB 216) and tells the story of how Holger Dansk is released from prison to fight against a troll by the name of Burman.

The hero&#x27;s popularity led to him being depicted on 15th- and 16th-century paintings in two churches in Denmark and Sweden. The Holger Danske and Burman painted on the ceiling of Floda Church in Sweden are attributed to Albertus Pictor around 1480. It also includes the text &quot;Holger Dane won victory over Burman&quot;; this is the burden of the Danish and Swedish ballad, but the painting predates other written texts for this ballad. On the slopes of Rönneberga outside Landskrona in south Sweden (formerly a part of Denmark), there is a burial mound named after Höljer (Holger) Danske.

== Modern era ==
Ogier in Danish legend is said to dwell in Kronborg Castle, his beard grown down to the floor. He will sleep there until the day when the country of Denmark is in the greatest peril, at which time he will awaken and save the nation. This is a common folklore motif, classed as Type 1960.2, &quot;The King Asleep in the Mountain&quot;. According to the tour guides of Kronborg Castle, legend has it that Holger sat down in his present location after walking all the way from his completed battles in France. It was popularized by the short story &quot;Holger Danske&quot; written by Hans Christian Andersen in 1845.

The 1789 opera &quot;Holger Danske&quot;, composed by F.L.Æ. Kunzen with a libretto by Jens Baggesen, had a considerable impact on Danish nationalism in the late 18th century. It spawned the literary &quot;Holger feud&quot;, which revealed the increasing dissatisfaction among the native Danish population with the German influence on Danish society. Danish intellectual Peter Andreas Heiberg joined the feud by writing a satirical version entitled &quot;Holger Tyske&quot; (&quot;Holger the German&quot;) ridiculing Baggesen&#x27;s lyrics. Ogier is also regarded as the symbol of national identity in Bernhard Severin Ingemann&#x27;s 1837 epic poem &quot;Holger Danske&quot;. Vernon Lee&#x27;s short story &quot;A Wicked Voice&quot; posits an opera called &quot;Ogier the Dane&quot; which the lead character Magnus attempts to finish under duress.

During the 1940-1945 German occupation of Denmark, a patriotic presentation of Kunzen&#x27;s opera in Copenhagen became a manifestation of Danish national feeling and opposition to the occupation. The largest armed group of the Danish resistance movement in World War II, Holger Danske, was named after the legend.

The Hotel Marienlyst in Helsingør commissioned a statue of Holger Danske in 1907 from the sculptor Hans Peder Pedersen-Dan. The bronze statue was outside the hotel until 2013, when it was sold and moved to Skjern. The bronze statue was based on an original in plaster. The plaster statue was placed in the vaults at Kronborg Castle, also in Helsingør, where it became a popular attraction in its own right. The plaster statue was replaced by a concrete copy in 1985.

In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Land&quot; (1916), &#x27;Ogier the Dane&#x27; is the archetypal name used to signify Danish invaders who have overrun Sussex. Ogier is the protagonist of &quot;The Viking&quot; (1951) by Edison Marshall, where he is portrayed as the child of Ragnar Lodbrok via his rape of the Northumbrian noblewoman Enid, mother of Aella of Northumbria; his chief rival is his paternal half-brother Hastein. The protagonist of Poul Anderson&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Three Hearts and Three Lions&quot; (1961), World War II Danish resistance member Holger Carlsen, time warps and learns that he actually is Ogier of the legend. Per Petterson&#x27;s novel &quot;I Curse the River of Time&quot; (2001) has a ferry named &quot;Holger Danske&quot;. There is an Ogier story event in the strategy video game &quot;Crusader Kings II&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a Cullen number is a member of the integer sequence formula_1 (where formula_2 is a natural number). Cullen numbers were first studied by James Cullen in 1905. The numbers are special cases of Proth numbers.

== Properties ==
In 1976 Christopher Hooley showed that the natural density of positive integers formula_3 for which &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a prime is of the order &quot;o&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for formula_4. In that sense, almost all Cullen numbers are composite. Hooley&#x27;s proof was reworked by Hiromi Suyama to show that it works for any sequence of numbers &quot;n&quot;·2&quot;n&quot; + &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are integers, and in particular also for Woodall numbers. The only known Cullen primes are those for &quot;n&quot; equal to:
: 1, 141, 4713, 5795, 6611, 18496, 32292, 32469, 59656, 90825, 262419, 361275, 481899, 1354828, 6328548, 6679881 .

Still, it is conjectured that there are infinitely many Cullen primes.

A Cullen number &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;n&quot; − 1 if &quot;p&quot; is a prime number of the form 8&quot;k&quot; − 3; furthermore, it follows from Fermat&#x27;s little theorem that if &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime, then &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;C&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) for each &quot;m&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) = (2&quot;k&quot; − &quot;k&quot;) 
 (&quot;p&quot; − 1) − &quot;k&quot; (for &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0). It has also been shown that the prime number &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;C&quot;(&quot;p&quot; + 1)/2 when the Jacobi symbol (2 | &quot;p&quot;) is −1, and that &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;C&quot;(3&quot;p&quot; − 1)/2 when the Jacobi symbol (2 | &quot;p&quot;) is + 1.

It is unknown whether there exists a prime number &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;C&quot;&quot;p&quot; is also prime.

&quot;Cp&quot; follows the recurrence relation
:formula_5.

== Generalizations ==

Sometimes, a generalized Cullen number base &quot;b&quot; is defined to be a number of the form &quot;n&quot;·&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; + 1, where &quot;n&quot; + 2 &gt; &quot;b&quot;; if a prime can be written in this form, it is then called a generalized Cullen prime. Woodall numbers are sometimes called Cullen numbers of the second kind.

As of October 2021, the largest known generalized Cullen prime is 2525532·732525532 + 1. It has 4,705,888 digits and was discovered by Tom Greer, a PrimeGrid participant.

According to Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, if there is a prime &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;p&quot; − 1 and &quot;n&quot; + 1 is divisible by &quot;p&quot; (especially, when &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot; − 1) and &quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;b&quot;, then &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; must be congruent to 1 mod &quot;p&quot; (since &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a power of &quot;b&quot;&quot;p&quot; − 1 and &quot;b&quot;&quot;p&quot; − 1 is congruent to 1 mod &quot;p&quot;). Thus, &quot;n&quot;·&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; + 1 is divisible by &quot;p&quot;, so it is not prime. For example, if some &quot;n&quot; congruent to 2 mod 6 (i.e. 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, ...), &quot;n&quot;·&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; + 1 is prime, then &quot;b&quot; must be divisible by 3 (except &quot;b&quot; = 1).

The least &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;n&quot;·&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; + 1 is prime (with question marks if this term is currently unknown) are
:1, 1, 2, 1, 1242, 1, 34, 5, 2, 1, 10, 1, ?, 3, 8, 1, 19650, 1, 6460, 3, 2, 1, 4330, 2, 2805222, 117, 2, 1, ?, 1, 82960, 5, 2, 25, 304, 1, 36, 3, 368, 1, 1806676, 1, 390, 53, 2, 1, ?, 3, ?, 9665, 62, 1, 1341174, 3, ?, 1072, 234, 1, 220, 1, 142, 1295, 8, 3, 16990, 1, 474, 129897, ?, 1, 13948, 1, ?, 3, 2, 1161, 12198, 1, 682156, 5, 350, 1, 1242, 26, 186, 3, 2, 1, 298, 14, 101670, 9, 2, 775, 202, 1, 1374, 63, 2, 1, ...

<doc id="321908" wikidata="Q1131291" url="?curid=321908" title="King asleep in mountain">
<text>The king asleep in mountain (D 1960.2 in Stith Thompson&#x27;s motif index system) is a prominent folklore trope found in many folktales and legends. Thompson termed it as the Kyffhäuser type. Some other designations are king in the mountain, king under the mountain, sleeping hero, or Bergentrückung (&quot;mountain rapture&quot;).

Examples include the legends of King Arthur, Fionn mac Cumhaill, Charlemagne, Ogier the Dane, King David, Frederick Barbarossa at Kyffhäuser, Genghis Khan, Constantine XI Palaiologos, Kraljević Marko, Sebastian of Portugal and King Matjaž.

The motifs A 571 &quot;Cultural hero asleep in mountain&quot;, and E 502, &quot;The Sleeping Army&quot; are similar and can occur in the same tale. A related motif is the &quot;Seven Sleepers&quot; (D 1960.1, also known as the &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; motif), whose type tale is the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus (AT tale type 766).

== General features ==
King in the mountain stories involve legendary heroes, often accompanied by armed retainers, sleeping in remote dwellings including caves on high mountaintops, remote islands, or supernatural worlds. The hero is frequently a historical figure of some military consequence in the history of the nation where the mountain is located.

The stories gathered by the Brothers Grimm concerning Frederick Barbarossa and Charlemagne are typical of the stories told, and have been influential on many variants and subsequent adaptations. The presence of the hero is unsuspected; until some herdsman wanders into the cave, typically looking for a lost animal, and sees the hero. The stories almost always mention the detail that the hero has grown a long beard, indicative of the long time he has slept beneath the mountain.

In the Brothers Grimm version, the hero speaks with the herdsman. Their conversation typically involves the hero asking, &quot;Do the eagles (or ravens) still circle the mountaintop?&quot; The herdsman, or a mysterious voice, replies, &quot;Yes, they still circle the mountaintop.&quot; &quot;Then begone! My time has not yet come.&quot;

The herdsman in this story was then supernaturally harmed by the experience: he ages rapidly, he emerges with his hair turned white, and often he dies after repeating the tale. The story goes on to say that the king sleeps in the mountain, awaiting a summons to arise with his knights and defend the nation in a time of deadly peril. The omen that presages his rising will be the extinction of the birds that trigger his awakening.

== Examples from Europe ==
A number of European kings, rulers, fictional characters and religious figures have become attached to this story. Major examples are King Arthur of Britain, Charlemagne of the Franks, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, as well as Ogier the Dane and William Tell.

=== Baltic states ===

* A motif in Latvian legends involves a castle sinking into ground leaving a hill behind it. In legends that have someone enter such hill, the inhabitants of the castle are found in sleep-like state. If the visitor is able to guess the name of the castle, it is returned to the surface with its inhabitants awokened. Choir song &quot;Gaismas pils&quot; (The Castle of Light), which is part of Latvia&#x27;s Cultural Canon, drew inspiration from these legends. 
* Vytautas the Great in Lithuania is believed by some to rise from the grave to defend the country when danger threatens it.

=== Britain and Ireland ===
* King Arthur (Great Britain and Brittany). According to the legend, Arthur was taken away to Avalon to sleep until he was needed by the people of Britain. Several legends talk of a herdsman who stumbles across a cave on mainland Britain, wherein he finds Arthur sleeping, often with his knights and Excalibur by his side. In a variation on this, sometimes the exploring herdsman finds instead just Arthur&#x27;s knights, or Sir Lancelot, Guinevere and the knights sleeping in wait on the return of the &quot;Once and Future King&quot;. In early Arthurian literature, Arthur references his predecessor Brân the Blessed as having his head placed on a mound overlooking Britain so as to protect it. He wishes to do the same, and later they overlook and protect Britain together.
* Merlin of the Arthurian legend, who is imprisoned in an oak tree by Nimue.
* Thomas the Rhymer is found under a hill with a retinue of knights in a tale from Anglo-Scottish border. Likewise, Harry Hotspur was said to have been hunting in the Cheviots when he and his hounds got holed-up in the Hen Hole (or &quot;Hell-hole&quot;), awaiting the sound of a hunting horn to awaken them from their slumber. Another border variant concerns a party of huntsmen who chased a roebuck into the Cheviots when they heard the sweetest music playing from the Henhole. However, when they entered, they became lost and are trapped to this day.

==== Wales ====

* Brân the Blessed. Referenced as protecting the Isles and overlooking Britain; his head severed and placed on a mound. Arthur later says he wishes to do the same and in early Arthurian literature both guard Britain together.
* Owain Lawgoch, Welsh soldier and nobleman (14th century).
* Owain Glyndŵr, the last native born Welshman to hold the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;; he disappeared after a long but ultimately unsuccessful rebellion against the English. He was never captured or betrayed and refused all Royal pardons.

Sometimes this type of story or archetype is also attached to not-so-heroic figures, who are either simple anti-heroes or fully villains, whose return would mean the end of the world, or whose sleep represents something positive. This kind of archetype is known as the &quot;Chained Satan&quot; archetype. Among examples of this are:
* The Sleeping Giant mountain in Connecticut, United States was said by the local Quinnipiac people to be the demon Hobbomock, sealed by the Great Spirit. One day he will supposedly awaken and destroy the world.
* Artavasdes I of Armenia, who according to Moses of Chorene was chained and cursed to stay eternally chained by his father Artaxias I.

<text>The Battle of Worringen was fought on 5 June 1288 near the town of Worringen (also spelled Woeringen), which is now part of Chorweiler, the northernmost borough (Stadtbezirk) of Cologne. It was the decisive battle of the War of the Limburg Succession, fought for the possession of the Duchy of Limburg between on one side the Archbishop Siegfried II of Cologne and Count Henry VI of Luxembourg, and on the other side, Duke John I of Brabant. 

== Prelude ==

The conflict arose after Duke Waleran IV of Limburg, a scion of the Lotharingian Ardennes-Verdun dynasty, had died without male heirs in 1279. His duchy was inherited by his daughter Ermengarde, who had married Count Reginald I of Guelders about 1270. Her husband claimed the Limburg heritage and in 1282 had his ducal title recognized by the German king Rudolf I.

The marriage of Reginald and Ermengarde, however, remained childless and when she died in 1283, Count Adolf VIII of Berg, Duke Waleran&#x27;s nephew as son of his elder brother Count Adolf VII, also claimed the Limburg duchy. As far as the succession in the female line was denied, Reginald was unable to assert his claims. An agreement seemed possible; nevertheless, Adolf of Berg preceded his Ardennes relatives when in September 1283 he sold his claims to the mighty Reginar duke John of Brabant.

John intended to enlarge his Brabant territory and re-unite the former Duchy of Lower Lorraine in the northwest of the Holy Roman Empire. Limburg was also economically important as it stretched along the major &quot;Via Regia&quot; trade route to Aachen and Cologne on the Rhine river. Though John held the title of Duke of Lothier since 1190, it had been solely honorific and did not imply any inheritance claims. The Limburg nobles therefore refused to accept John&#x27;s overlordship, when his forces invaded the duchy.

Between 1283 and 1288, the conflict was delayed by several smaller confrontations between both sides, none of them decisive. Meanwhile, most of the other local powers chose sides. Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archbishop of Cologne, suspiciously eyed John&#x27;s increasing power in the Lower Lorraine lands. In view of their common interests, he and Reginald of Guelders forged an alliance in August 1284, joined by Count Henry VI of Luxembourg, and his brother Waleran I of Ligny, as well as by Count Adolf of Nassau. On the other side the Westphalian counts of Mark took the chance to affirm their independence from the Archbishop of Cologne and together with the Counts of Loon, Tecklenburg and Waldeck allied with Brabant and Berg.

== Battle ==

In May 1288, Henry of Luxembourg had led a significant army into the Cologne region. Numerous vassals and allies joined his forces and Reginald of Guelders finally sold his rights to Limburg to him, just before peace talks were scheduled. This angered John of Brabant, who in turn started a campaign against Reginald. In Brühl, he met with the Mark and Berg troops by the end of the month. Together they marched against Worringen, a castle on the Rhine held by the Archbishop of Cologne. John laid siege to the fortress, supported by the Cologne citizens, who were eager to free themselves from the archbishop&#x27;s rule.

Siegfried, witnessing the estrangement of his subjects, likewise started marching. He and Henry of Luxembourg gathered their troops at Neuss and moved to Brauweiler Abbey. On the early morning of 5 June 1288 they departed for Worringen at the head of their troops.

In the earliest phases of the battle, John of Brabant and Henry of Luxembourg met in a fierce fight, in which Henry and two of his brothers were killed. Soon after that, Siegfried entered the battle and in a bold advance was able to repel the Berg troops and the Cologne militia, however with too little support from his reserves.

In mid-afternoon, the Berg and Mark troops, along with the Cologne citizens, had gathered again and started a savage attack on the archbishop&#x27;s forces. The battle ended in a victory for Brabant when Reginald of Guelders was captured by Daniel van Bouchout and Lord Walram of Valkenburg had to retreat. Archbishop Siegfried was taken prisoner by John of Brabant and delivered to Adolf of Berg.

== Aftermath ==

The number of deaths at the battle of Worringen is estimated at 1100 on the Guelders side and 40 on the Brabant side. The casualties among the house of Luxembourg was particularly high: most of the male relatives of the later German emperor Henry VII perished there. Archbishop Siegfried was imprisoned for over a year at Schloss Burg, before he paid a ransom and agreed to Count Adolf&#x27;s demands. Worringen Castle and several other fortresses of the bishop were demolished. On 14 August 1288 Adolf granted city rights to Düsseldorf, which became the capital of Berg. Reginald of Guelders was released after he had renounced all claims to the Duchy of Limburg.

The Battle of Worringen meant a rise in the power of Brabant, Berg and Mark, while the City of Cologne gained its independence from the Archbishopric and finally the status of a free imperial city in 1475. The Duchy of Limburg was added to the Duchy of Brabant in 1289, an arrangement approved by King Rudolph and again by his former opponent Adolf of Nassau, after he was elected King of the Romans in 1292. In Luxembourg, Henry VI was succeeded by his nine-year-old son Henry VII, who in 1292 settled the conflict with Brabant by marrying John&#x27;s daughter Margaret. The Archbishopric of Cologne never recovered from the loss of the city of Cologne.

Jan van Heelu wrote a chronicle of the battle.

<text>Alberta&#x27;s rivers flow towards three different bodies of water, the Arctic Ocean, the Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Alberta is located immediately east of the continental divide, so no rivers from Alberta reach the Pacific Ocean.

==List of rivers in Alberta==
The north of the province is drained towards the Arctic Ocean, and the northern rivers have comparatively higher discharge rates than the southern ones, that flow through a drier area. Most of Alberta&#x27;s southern half has waters flowing toward the Hudson Bay, the only exception being the Milk River and its tributaries, that flow south through the Missouri and Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.

===Arctic Ocean watershed===
Albertan rivers in the Arctic Ocean watershed are drained through Great Slave Lake and Mackenzie River, except for Petitot River which is drained through Liard River directly into the Mackenzie River, thus bypassing the Great Slave Lake.

<doc id="321913" wikidata="Q3343131" url="?curid=321913" title="Quasiperfect number">
<text>In mathematics, a quasiperfect number is a natural number &quot;n&quot; for which the sum of all its divisors (the sum-of-divisors function &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is equal to 2&quot;n&quot; + 1. Equivalently, &quot;n&quot; is the sum of its non-trivial divisors (that is, its divisors excluding 1 and &quot;n&quot;). No quasiperfect numbers have been found so far.

The quasiperfect numbers are the abundant numbers of minimal abundance (which is 1).

== Theorems ==
If a quasiperfect number exists, it must be an odd square number greater than 1035 and have at least seven distinct prime factors.

== Related ==
For a perfect number &quot;n&quot; the sum of all its divisors is equal to 2&quot;n&quot;. For an almost perfect number &quot;n&quot; the sum of all its divisors is equal to 2&quot;n&quot; - 1.

Numbers n exist whose sum of factors = 2n + 2. They are of form 2^(n - 1) * (2^n - 3) where 2^n - 3 is a prime. The only exception known till yet is 650 = 2 * 5^2 * 13. They are 20, 104, 464, 650, 1952, 130304, 522752, etc. (OEIS ) Numbers n exist whose sum of factors = 2n - 2. They are of form 2^(n - 1) * (2^n + 1) where 2^n + 1 is prime. No exceptions are found till yet. Because of 5 known Fermat Primes, there are 5 known such numbers: 3, 10, 136, 32896 and 2147516416. (OEIS )

Betrothed numbers relate to quasiperfect numbers like amicable numbers relate to perfect numbers.

<doc id="321918" wikidata="Q2067166" url="?curid=321918" title="Semiperfect number">
<text>In number theory, a semiperfect number or pseudoperfect number is a natural number &quot;n&quot; that is equal to the sum of all or some of its proper divisors. A semiperfect number that is equal to the sum of all its proper divisors is a perfect number.

The first few semiperfect numbers are: 6, 12, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 36, 40, ... 

== Properties ==
* Every multiple of a semiperfect number is semiperfect. A semiperfect number that is not divisible by any smaller semiperfect number is called &quot;primitive&quot;.
* Every number of the form 2&quot;m&quot;&quot;p&quot; for a natural number &quot;m&quot; and an odd prime number &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; &lt; 2&quot;m&quot;+1 is also semiperfect. 
** In particular, every number of the form 2&quot;m&quot;(2&quot;m&quot;+1 − 1) is semiperfect, and indeed perfect if 2&quot;m&quot;+1 − 1 is a Mersenne prime.
* The smallest odd semiperfect number is 945 (see, e.g., Friedman 1993).
* A semiperfect number is necessarily either perfect or abundant. An abundant number that is not semiperfect is called a weird number. 
* With the exception of 2, all primary pseudoperfect numbers are semiperfect. 
* Every practical number that is not a power of two is semiperfect.
* The natural density of the set of semiperfect numbers exists.

==Primitive semiperfect numbers==
A primitive semiperfect number (also called a &quot;primitive pseudoperfect number&quot;, &quot;irreducible semiperfect number&quot; or &quot;irreducible pseudoperfect number&quot;) is a semiperfect number that has no semiperfect proper divisor.

The first few primitive semiperfect numbers are 6, 20, 28, 88, 104, 272, 304, 350, ... 

There are infinitely many such numbers. All numbers of the form 2&quot;m&quot;&quot;p&quot;, with &quot;p&quot; a prime between 2&quot;m&quot; and 2&quot;m&quot;+1, are primitive semiperfect, but this is not the only form: for example, 770. There are infinitely many odd primitive semiperfect numbers, the smallest being 945, a result of Paul Erdős: there are also infinitely many primitive semiperfect numbers that are not harmonic divisor numbers.

Every semiperfect number is a multiple of a primitive semiperfect number.

<text>Osborne Reynolds (23 August 1842 – 21 February 1912) was an Irish-born British innovator in the understanding of fluid dynamics. Separately, his studies of heat transfer between solids and fluids brought improvements in boiler and condenser design. He spent his entire career at what is now the University of Manchester.

==Life==
Osborne Reynolds was born in Belfast and moved with his parents soon afterward to Dedham, Essex. His father, Reverend Osborne Reynolds, was a Fellow of Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge who worked as a school headmaster and clergyman, but was also a very able mathematician with a keen interest in mechanics. The father took out a number of patents for improvements to agricultural equipment, and the son credits him with being his chief teacher as a boy. Reynolds showed an early aptitude and liking for the study of mechanics. In his late teens, for the year before entering university, he went to work as an apprentice at the workshop of Edward Hayes, a well known shipbuilder in Stony Stratford, where he obtained practical experience in the manufacture and fitting out of coastal steamers (and thus gained an early appreciation of the practical value of understanding fluid dynamics).

Osborne Reynolds attended Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge and graduated in 1867 as the seventh wrangler in mathematics. He had chosen to study mathematics at Cambridge because, in his own words in his 1868 application for the professorship, &quot;From my earliest recollection I have had an irresistible liking for mechanics and the physical laws on which mechanics as a science is based... my attention drawn to various mechanical phenomena, for the explanation of which I discovered that a knowledge of mathematics was essential.&quot; 
For the year immediately following his graduation from Cambridge he again took up a post with a civil engineering firm, Lawson and Mansergh of London, as a practising civil engineer working with the London (Croydon) sewage transport system.

In 1868 he was appointed to the newly instituted Chair of Civil and Mechanical Engineering at Owens College in Manchester (now the University of Manchester), becoming in that year one of the first professors in UK university history to hold the title of &quot;Professor of Engineering&quot;. This professorship had been newly created and financed by a group of manufacturing industrialists in the Manchester area, and they also had a leading role in selecting the 25–year–old Reynolds to fill the position.
Reynolds remained at Owens College for the rest of his career – in 1880 the college became a constituent college of the newly founded Victoria University. 

Reynolds was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1877 and awarded the Royal Medal in 1888. He retired in 1905 and died of influenza 21 February 1912 at Watchet in Somerset. He was buried at the Church of St Decuman, Watchet.

==Fluid mechanics==
Reynolds most famously studied the conditions in which the flow of fluid in pipes transitioned from laminar flow to turbulent flow.
In 1883 Reynolds demonstrated the transition to turbulent flow in a classic experiment in which he examined the behaviour of water flow under different flow rates using a small jet of dyed water introduced into the centre of flow in a larger pipe.

The larger pipe was glass so the behaviour of the layer of dyed flow could be observed, and at the end of this pipe there was a flow control valve used to vary the water velocity inside the tube. When the velocity was low, the dyed layer remained distinct through the entire length of the large tube. When the velocity was increased, the layer broke up at a given point and diffused throughout the fluid&#x27;s cross-section. The point at which this happened was the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow.

From these experiments came the dimensionless Reynolds number for dynamic similarity—the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. Reynolds also proposed what is now known as Reynolds-averaging of turbulent flows, where quantities such as velocity are expressed as the sum of mean and fluctuating components. Such averaging allows for &#x27;bulk&#x27; description of turbulent flow, for example using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations.

Reynolds&#x27; contributions to fluid mechanics were not lost on ship designers (&quot;naval architects&quot;). The ability to make a small scale model of a ship, and extract useful predictive data with respect to a full size ship, depends directly on the experimentalist applying Reynolds&#x27; turbulence principles to friction drag computations, along with a proper application of William Froude&#x27;s theories of gravity wave energy and propagation. Reynolds himself had a number of papers concerning ship design published in &quot;Transactions of the Institution of Naval Architects&quot;.

==Publications==
His publications in fluid dynamics began in the early 1870s. His final theoretical model published in the mid-1890s is still the standard mathematical framework used today. Examples of titles from his more groundbreaking reports:

==Other work==

Reynolds published about seventy science and engineering research reports. When towards the end of his career these were republished as a collection they filled three volumes. For a catalogue and short summaries of them see the External links. Areas covered besides fluid dynamics included thermodynamics, kinetic theory of gases, condensation of steam, screw-propeller-type ship propulsion, turbine-type ship propulsion, hydraulic brakes, hydrodynamic lubrication, and laboratory apparatus for better measurement of Joule&#x27;s mechanical equivalent of heat. For his work on lubrication, he was named by Duncan Dowson as one of the 23 &quot;Men of Tribology&quot;.

One of the subjects that Reynolds studied in the 1880s was the properties of granular materials, including dilatant materials. In 1903 appeared his 250-page book &quot;The Sub-Mechanics of the Universe&quot;, in which he tried to generalise the mechanics of granular materials to be &quot;capable of accounting for all the physical evidence, as we know it, in the Universe&quot;. His aim seems to have been to construct a theory of aether, which he considered to be in a liquid state. The ideas were extremely difficult to understand or evaluate, and in any case were overtaken by other developments in physics around the same time.

<text>Agnihotra (IAST: &quot;Agnihotra&quot;, Devnagari: अग्निहोत्र) refers to the yajna of offering ghee into the sacred fire as per strict rites, and may include twice-daily heated milk offering made by those in the Śrauta tradition. The ritual has been described by P.E. Dumont as a &quot;fertility charm&quot;, and as a &quot;solar charm&quot; which symbolically preserved and created the sun at nightfall and sunrise.

This tradition dates back to the Vedic age; the Brahmans perform the Agnihotra ritual chanting the verses from the Rigveda. It is part of a pan-Indo-Iranian heritage, which includes the related Iranian fire-worship ritual called Zoroastrian &quot;Yasna Haptaŋhāiti&quot; ritual mentioned in the Old Avestan. In the historical Vedic religion, Agnihotra was the simplest public rite, and the head of every Brahmin and Vaishya family was required to conduct it twice daily. It was already popular in India with &quot;Upaniṣads&quot; as religious performance. The tradition is now practiced in many parts of South Asia in the Indian sub-continent, including primarily India and also in Nepal. The Brahmin who performs the Agnihotra ritual is called an Agnihotri.

==Vedic Agnihotra==

===Preliminaries===

The ritual is conducted twice daily, right before or after sunrise and after sunset or the appearance of the first night star. The morning and evening agnihotras differ by the mantras and chants made by the officiants. At least four people take part in the sacrifice: the sacrificer, who hires priests to perform the ceremony (Brahmin), his wife, an Adhvaryu and a milker.

Vedic rituals are typically performed by four priests: the aforementioned &quot;adhvaryu&quot;, who is responsible for the physical details of the sacrifice and chants the Yajurveda, a &quot;hotṛi&quot; who recites the Rigveda, an &quot;udgātṛi&quot; who sings hymns of the Samaveda, and a &quot;brahman&quot; who supervises the ceremony, and recites the Atharvaveda while correcting any errors that may occur. There are three fires: an eastern offertorial fire called an &quot;āhavanīya&quot; lit in a square fire pit, a western fire called the &quot;gārhapatya&quot; lit in a circular fire pit, which represents the householder&#x27;s fire, and a southern fire simply called the &quot;dakṣiṇāgni&quot; (Southern fire). During the ceremonies, a poker, a pot called an &quot;agnihotrasthālī&quot;, a spoon known as a &quot;sruva&quot;, and a larger ladle called the &quot;agnihotrahavani&quot; are all used. At the centre of the ritual space is an earthen altar called the &quot;vedi&quot; where the tools to perform the ritual are placed.

===Ritual===
When the sacrificial area has been cleaned and the sacrificial fire lit, a cow is brought to the grounds and the milker, an &quot;ā́rya&quot; and not a &quot;śūdra,&quot; recites mantras before it, then brings the calf to the right side of its mother before beginning the milking. The milk is kept in the &quot;agnihotrasthālī&quot;, which can also only be made by an &quot;ā́rya.&quot; When the milking is complete, the adhvaryu pours water around the three fires, before boiling the collected milk on coals collected from the &quot;gārhapatya&quot;. The &quot;adhvaryu&quot; draws milk from the &quot;agnihotrasthālī&quot; to the &quot;agnihotrahavani&quot;, pouring it onto sacrificial sticks twice: first when reciting mantras, and the second silently. He then ritually consumes some of the milk before placing the sticks into the &quot;āhavanīya&quot;. When the libations are complete, the &quot;agnihotrahavani&quot; is cleaned with Darbha grass and refilled with water. It is then heated on the &quot;āhavanīya&quot; as additional mantras are recited, and poured onto the &quot;vedi&quot; as an additional libation. In certain versions of the ritual (but not that contained in the Tattirīya Brahmana), this is followed by a blade of grass being offered to the &quot;āhavanīya&quot;. When the ceremony is complete, the &quot;adhvaryu&quot; sips some of the leftover water, recites the mantra &quot;From Rta I have found Satya&quot; and pours water on his head.

===Ithihasa===
The Brāhmaṇas give several explanations for the origin of the agnihotra. In one, Prajapati creates Agni, and then offers the sweat of his brow (which became ghee) or his eye after hearing his voice commanding himself to sacrifice, creating Surya. The origin of the exclamation &quot;svāhā&quot;, said as offerings are made into the sacrificial fire, is explained as a combination of &quot;svā&quot; (own) and &quot;āha&quot; (spoken). In another, the agnihotra is a condensed version of a thousand-year sacrifice Prajapati and the other devas performed to gain divine power.

==Agnihotra rituals in Nepal==
Witzel (1992) locates the first Agnishala hypothetically at Jhul (Mātātīrtha), in the western ridge of the Kathmandu valley and later at the southern rim of the palace of Aṃśuvermā at Hadigaon, Kathmandu. The first source of inscription evidence was from Tachapal tole, east part of Bhaktapur city, also shown by a legend that the Maithila King Harisimhadeva would establish the yantra of Taleju Bhavānī in the house of an Agnihotri. From 1600 CE onward, the Agnihotra has been attested to the Agnishala temple in Patan only.

The Agnihotra ritual in Nepal has been first recorded in an inscription of King Anandadeva in c. 1140 CE that mentions of the initiations of his two sons, viz. Yasho Malla and prince Somesvara at Agnimatha (or Agnishala in Lalitpur). The temple of Agnishala since the 12th century maintains the Vedic tradition of Agnihotra fire sacrifice ritual and despite having undergone many ritual changes, the basic Vedic performance is still intact. The Agnishala is maintained by the Newar Rajopadhyaya Brahmins of Patan, who are the premier Krishna Yajurvedic Brahmins of Nepal.

Along with these, there are other Agnishalas identified and recently revived, viz.
*at southern edge of Pashupatinath temple (a UNESCO World Heritage Site of Nepal) by a Purbe Brahmin. This has been in practice for almost 200 years now, and for this Agnishala, in 1974 the government provided NRs. 18,000 (then around US$7,000) per year.
*at Kumarigal, south of Bouddha (another UNESCO World Heritage Site in Nepal) in Kathmandu by Narayan Prasad, a Purbe Brahmin
*at Thamel, north of central Kathmandu by Tirtha Raj Acharya

==Arya Samaj==
Arya Samaj is a religious reform movement founded in 1875 advocating a return to Vedic religion as interpreted by its founder, Dayananda Saraswati. Strongly criticizing the &quot;Puranic&quot; ritual of performing pujas to murtis (religious images such as statues), adherents perform a variation of agnihotra as part of the five yajnas as described in Vedic texts.

==Gajanan Maharaj==
A simplified variant of the agnihotra ceremony was popularized in the mid-1900s by Gajanan Maharaj, and entails the offering of ghee and brown rice into only a single fire lit in a copper pyramid-shaped brazier with cow dung and additional amounts of ghee. Mantras are repeated during this process. Practitioners claim a number of physical and environmental benefits from performing the ritual; however, these are pseudoscientific. In 2007, Sylvia Kratz and Ewald Schaung found that while Agnihotra ash possibly increased the amount of phosphorus in soil, levels were the same regardless of whether the ceremony was done at the prescribed times with mantras or not. The composition of the pyramid was found to be a factor, with ash created in iron pyramids containing significantly less phosphorus than ones made of copper.

===Mantras===
Like the Vedic Agnihotra, the modern version of Agnihotra perpetuated by Gajanan Maharaj and groups such as Homa Therapy has two variants, one for the evening and one for the morning. At sunset, the practitioner says &quot;Agnaye svāhā idam Agnaye na mama&quot; (Devanagari: अग्नये स्वाहा इदम् अग्नये न मम), offering the first half of the rice or ghee into the fire after &quot;svāhā&quot; is spoken. After the first mantra is said, the practitioner then says, &quot;Prajāpataye svāhā Prajāpataye idam na mama&quot; (Devanagari: प्रजापतये स्वाहा प्रजापतये इदम् न मम), again offering a second portion of rice and/or ghee as soon as &quot;svāhā&quot; is spoken. The morning Agnihotra is identical, save for the fact that Surya is substituted for Agni.

<text>The Seven Sleepers (; ), also known in Christendom as Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, and in Islam as Aṣḥāb al-Kahf (اصحاب الکهف, &quot;aṣḥāb al-kahf&quot;, lit. Companions of the Cave), is a late antique Christian legend, and a Qur’anic Islamic story. The Christian legend speaks about a group of youths who hid inside a cave outside the city of Ephesus (modern-day Selçuk, Turkey) around AD 250 to escape Roman persecutions of Christians and emerged many years later. The Qur&#x27;anic version of the story appears in Sura 18 (18:9–26).

==Origins and propagation ==
The story appeared in several Syriac sources before Gregory of Tours&#x27;s lifetime (538–594). The earliest Syriac manuscript copy is in MS Saint-Petersburg No. 4, which dates to the fifth century. 

The earliest known version of this story is found in the writings of the Syriac bishop Jacob of Serugh (–521), who relies on an earlier Greek source, now lost. Jacob of Serugh, an Edessan poet-theologian, wrote a homily in verse on the subject of the Seven Sleepers, which was published in the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;. Another sixth-century version, in a Syrian manuscript in the British Museum (&quot;Cat. Syr. Mss&quot;, p. 1090), gives eight sleepers.

Whether the original account was written in Syriac or Greek was a matter of debate, but today a Greek original is generally accepted. The pilgrim account &quot;De situ terrae sanctae&quot;, written between 518 and 531, records the existence of a church dedicated to the sleepers in Ephesus.

An outline of this tale appears in the 6th-century writings of Gregory of Tours and in &quot;History of the Lombards&quot; of Paul the Deacon (720–799). The best-known Western version of the story appears in Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (1259–1266). It also appears in BHO (&quot;Pueri septem&quot;), BHG (&quot;Pueri VII&quot;) and BHL &quot;Dormientes (Septem) Ephesi&quot;.

Accounts of the Christian legend are found in at least nine medieval languages and preserved in over 200 manuscripts, mainly dating to between the 9th and 13th centuries. These include 104 Latin manuscripts, 40 Greek, 33 Arabic, 17 Syriac, six Ethiopic, five Coptic, two Armenian, one Middle Irish, and one Old English. Byzantine writer Symeon the Metaphrast (died c. 1000) alluded to it. It was also translated into Sogdian. In the 13th century, the poet Chardri composed an Old French version. The ninth-century Irish calendar commemorates the Seven Sleepers on 7 August.

It was also translated into Persian, Kyrgyz, and Tatar.

===Dissemination in the West: story and relics===
The story rapidly attained a wide diffusion throughout Christendom. It was popularized in the West by Gregory of Tours, in his late 6th-century collection of miracles, &quot;De gloria martyrum&quot; (&quot;Glory of the Martyrs)&quot;. Gregory claimed to have gotten the story from &quot;a certain Syrian interpreter&quot; (&quot;Syro quidam interpretante&quot;), but this could refer to either a Syriac- or Greek-speaker from the Levant. During the period of the Crusades, bones from the sepulchres near Ephesus, identified as relics of the Seven Sleepers, were transported to Marseille, France, in a large stone coffin, which remained a trophy of the Abbey of St Victor, Marseille.

The Seven Sleepers were included in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; compilation, the most popular book of the later Middle Ages, which fixed a precise date for their resurrection, AD 478, in the reign of Theodosius.

==Christian story==
The story says that during the persecutions by the Roman emperor Decius, around AD 250, seven young men were accused of following Christianity. They were given some time to recant their faith, but they refused to bow to Roman idols. Instead they chose to give their worldly goods to the poor and retire to a mountain cave to pray, where they fell asleep. The Emperor, seeing that their attitude towards paganism had not improved, ordered the mouth of the cave to be sealed.
Decius died in 251, and many years passed during which Christianity went from being persecuted to being the state religion of the Roman Empire. At some later time—usually given as during the reign of Theodosius II (408–450)—in AD 447 when heated discussions were taking place between various schools of Christianity about the resurrection of the body in the day of judgement and life after death, a landowner decided to open up the sealed mouth of the cave, thinking to use it as a cattle pen. He opened it and found the sleepers inside. They awoke, imagining that they had slept but one day, and sent one of their number to Ephesus to buy food, with instructions to be careful.

Upon arriving in the city, this person was astounded to find buildings with crosses attached; the townspeople for their part were astounded to find a man trying to spend old coins from the reign of Decius. The bishop was summoned to interview the sleepers; they told him their miracle story, and died praising God.

The various lives of the Seven Sleepers in Greek and in other non-Latin languages are listed at &quot;BHO&quot;.

==Account in the Quran==
The polytheists (&quot;mushriks&quot;) of Mecca, after consulting with the people of the Book, tested Muhammad by asking him three questions, and 
Surah Al-Kahf was sent down in answer to them. The &quot;mushriks&quot; inquired about the identity of the Sleepers of the Cave, the real story of Khidr, and about Dhu al-Qarnayn.

The story of the Companions of the Cave () is referred to in Quran 18:9-26. The precise number of the sleepers is not stated. The Quran furthermore points to the fact that people, shortly after the incident emerged, started to make &quot;idle guesses&quot; as to how many people were in the cave. To this the Quran asserts that: &quot;My Sustainer knows best how many they were&quot;. Similarly, regarding the exact period of time the people stayed in the cave, the Quran, after asserting the guesswork of the people that &quot;they remained in the cave for 300 years and nine added&quot;, resolves that &quot;God knows best how long they remained [there].&quot; According to the 25th verse of Al-Kahf, the Companions of the Cave have slept for 300 years in the solar calendar and slept 309 in the lunar calendar since the lunar calendar is 11 days shorter than the solar, which explains the inclusion of the additional nine years. The Quran says that the sleepers included a dog, which Islamic tradition names as Qitmir, who guarded the entrance of the cave (verse 18).

==Number and names==
===Jewish and Christian versions===
Early versions do not all agree on or even specify the number of sleepers. Some Jewish circles and the Christians of Najran believed in only three brothers; the East Syriac, five. Most Syriac accounts have eight, including a nameless watcher which God sets over the sleepers. A 6th-century Latin text titled &quot;Pilgrimage of Theodosius&quot; featured the sleepers as seven people in number, with a dog named Viricanus.

Bartłomiej Grysa lists at least seven different sets of names for the sleepers:
* Maximian, Martinian, Dionisius, John, Constantine, Malchus, Serapion
* Maximilian, Martinian, Dionisius, John, Constantine, Malkhus, Serapion, Anthony
* Maximilian, Martinian, Dionisius, John, Constantine, Yamblikh (Iamblichus), Anthony
* Makṯimilīnā (Maksimilīnā, Maḥsimilīnā), Marnūš (Marṭūs), Kafašṭaṭyūš (Ksōṭōnos), Yamlīḫā (Yamnīḫ), Mišlīnā, Saḏnūš, Dabranūš (Bīrōnos), Samōnos, Buṭōnos, Qālos (according to aṭ-Ṭabarī and ad-Damīrī)
* Achillides, Probatus, Stephanus, Sambatus, Quiriacus, Diogenus, Diomedes (according to Gregory of Tours)
* Ikilios, Fruqtis, Istifanos, Sebastos, Qiryaqos, Dionisios (according to Michael the Syrian)
* Aršellītīs, Probatios, Sabbastios, Stafanos, Kīriakos, Diōmetios, Avhenios (according to the Coptic version)

===Islamic view===
In Islam no specific number is mentioned. Qur&#x27;an 18:22 discusses the disputes regarding their numbers. The verse says:

Some will say, &quot;They were three, their dog was the fourth,&quot; while others will say, &quot;They were five, their dog was the sixth,&quot; only guessing blindly. And others will say, &quot;They were seven and their dog was the eighth.&quot; Say, O Prophet, &quot;My Lord knows best their exact number. Only a few people know as well.&quot; So do not argue about them except with sure knowledge, nor consult any of those who debate about them.

==Duration==
===Christian accounts===
The number of years the sleepers slept also varies between accounts. The highest number, given by Gregory of Tours, was 373 years. Some accounts have 372. Jacobus de Voragine calculated it at 196 (from the year 252 until 448). Other calculations suggest 195.

===Islamic accounts===
The Qu&#x27;ran in regard to the duration of the sleep only mentions the conflicting numbers that people assigned, in Surah 18:25-26, which states, &quot;They remained in the Cave for three hundred years; and others added nine more years. / Say: &#x27;Allah knows best how long they remained in it, for only He knows all that is hidden in the heavens and the earth. How well He sees; how well He hears! The creatures have no other guardian than Him; He allows none to share His authority.&#x27;&quot;

==Caves of the Seven Sleepers==
Several sites are attributed as the &quot;Cave of the Seven Sleepers&quot;, but none could empirically convince to be the original site associated with the legend. As the earliest versions of the legend spread out from Ephesus, an early Christian catacomb in that area came to be associated with it, attracting scores of pilgrims. On the slopes of Mount Pion (Mount Coelian) near Ephesus (near modern Selçuk in Turkey), the grotto of the Seven Sleepers with ruins of the religious site built over it was excavated in 1926–1928. The excavation brought to light several hundred graves dated to the 5th and 6th centuries. Inscriptions dedicated to the Seven Sleepers were found on the walls and in the graves. This grotto is still shown to tourists.

Other possible sites of the cave of the Seven Sleepers are in Damascus, Syria and Afşin and Tarsus, Turkey. Afşin is near the antique Roman city of Arabissus, to which the East Roman Emperor Justinian paid a visit. The site was a Hittite temple, used as a Roman temple and later as a church in Roman and Byzantine times. The Emperor brought marble niches from Western Anatolia as gifts for it, which are preserved inside the Eshab-ı Kehf Kulliye mosque to this day. The Seljuks continued to use the place of worship as a church and a mosque. It was turned into a mosque over time, with the conversion of the local population to Islam.

There is a cave near Amman, Jordan, also known as the Cave of Seven Sleepers, which has eight smaller sealed tombs present inside and a ventilation duct coming out of the cave.

==Modern literature==
===Early modern===

The account had become proverbial in 16th century Protestant culture. The poet John Donne could ask,

&lt;poem&gt;
 I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I
 Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?
 But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
 Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers&#x27; den?—John Donne, &quot;The Good-Morrow&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;

In John Heywood&#x27;s &quot;Play called the Four PP&quot; (1530s), the Pardoner, a Renaissance update of the protagonist in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot;, offers his companions the opportunity to kiss &quot;a slipper / Of one of the Seven Sleepers&quot;, but the relic is presented as absurdly as the Pardoner&#x27;s other offerings, which include &quot;the great-toe of the Trinity&quot; and &quot;a buttock-bone of Pentecost.&quot;

Little is heard of the Seven Sleepers during the Enlightenment, but the account revived with the coming of Romanticism. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; may have been the source for retellings of the Seven Sleepers in Thomas de Quincey&#x27;s &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot;, in a poem by Goethe, Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;Rip van Winkle&quot;, H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;. It also might have an influence on the motif of the &quot;King asleep in mountain&quot;. Mark Twain did a burlesque of the story of the Seven Sleepers in Chapter 13 of Volume 2 of &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;.

===Contemporary===
Edward Gibbon gives different accounts of the story in &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.

The Serbian writer Danilo Kiš retells the story of the Seven Sleepers in a short story, &quot;The Legend of the Sleepers&quot;, from his book &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Dead&quot;.

The Italian author Andrea Camilleri incorporates the story in his novel &quot;The Terracotta Dog&quot; in which the protagonist is led to a cave containing the titular watchdog (as described in the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; and called &quot;Kytmyr&quot; in Sicilian folklore) and the saucer of silver coins with which one of the sleepers is to buy &quot;pure food&quot; from the bazaar in Ephesus (&quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; 18.19). The Seven Sleepers are symbolically replaced by lovers Lisetta Moscato and Mario Cunich, who were killed in their nuptial bed by an assassin hired by Lisseta&#x27;s incestuous father and later laid to rest in a cave in the Sicilian countryside.

In Susan Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; series, Will Stanton awakens the Seven Sleepers in &quot;The Grey King&quot;, and in &quot;Silver on the Tree&quot;, they ride in the last battle against the Dark.

The &quot;Seven Sleepers&quot; series by Gilbert Morris takes a modern approach to the story in which seven teenagers must be awakened to fight evil in a post-nuclear-apocalypse world.

John Buchan refers to the Seven Sleepers in &quot;The Three Hostages&quot; in which Richard Hannay surmises that his wife Mary, who is a sound sleeper, is descended from one of the seven who has married one of the Foolish Virgins.

The Seven Sleepers are mentioned in the song &quot;Les Invisibles&quot; on the 1988 Blue Öyster Cult album Imaginos.

Several languages have idioms related to the Seven Sleepers, including:
* Hungarian: &quot;hétalvó&quot;, literally a &quot;seven-sleeper&quot;, or &quot;one who sleeps for an entire week&quot;, is a colloquial reference to a person who oversleeps or who is typically drowsy.
* Irish: &quot;Na seacht gcodlatáin&quot; refers to hibernating animals.
* Norwegian: a late riser may be referred to as a &quot;syvsover&quot; (&quot;seven sleeper&quot;)
* Swedish: a late riser may be referred to as a &quot;sjusovare&quot; (&quot;seven sleeper&quot;).
* Welsh: a late riser may be referred to as a &quot;saith cysgadur&quot; (&quot;seven sleeper&quot;) – as in the 1885 novel &quot;Rhys Lewis&quot; by Daniel Owen, where the protagonist is referred to as such in chapter 37, p. 294 (Hughes a&#x27;i Fab, Caerdydd, 1948).

==Feast day==
The most recent edition of the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; commemorates the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus under the date of 27 July. The Byzantine calendar commemorates them with feasts on 4 August and 22 October. Syriac Orthodox calendars gives various dates: 21 April, 2 August, 13 August, 23 October and 24 October.

<text>In number theory, a weird number is a natural number that is abundant but not semiperfect. In other words, the sum of the proper divisors (divisors including 1 but not itself) of the number is greater than the number, but no subset of those divisors sums to the number itself.

== Examples ==

The smallest weird number is 70. Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 35; these sum to 74, but no subset of these sums to 70. The number 12, for example, is abundant but &quot;not&quot; weird, because the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which sum to 16; but 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.

The first few weird numbers are 
: 70, 836, 4030, 5830, 7192, 7912, 9272, 10430, 10570, 10792, 10990, 11410, 11690, 12110, 12530, 12670, 13370, 13510, 13790, 13930, 14770, ... .

== Properties ==

Infinitely many weird numbers exist. For example, 70&quot;p&quot; is weird for all primes &quot;p&quot; ≥ 149. In fact, the set of weird numbers has positive asymptotic density.

It is not known if any odd weird numbers exist. If so, they must be greater than 1021.

Sidney Kravitz has shown that for &quot;k&quot; a positive integer, &quot;Q&quot; a prime exceeding 2&quot;k&quot;, and
:formula_1
also prime and greater than 2&quot;k&quot;, then
:formula_2
is a weird number.
With this formula, he found the large weird number
:formula_3

===Primitive weird numbers===
A property of weird numbers is that if &quot;n&quot; is weird, and &quot;p&quot; is a prime greater than the sum of divisors σ(&quot;n&quot;), then &quot;pn&quot; is also weird. This leads to the definition of &quot;primitive weird numbers&quot;: weird numbers that are not a multiple of other weird numbers . Among the 1765 weird numbers less than one million, there are 24 primitive weird numbers. The construction of Kravitz yields primitive weird numbers, since all weird numbers of the form formula_4 are primitive, but the existence of infinitely many &quot;k&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; which yield a prime &quot;R&quot; is not guaranteed. It is conjectured that there exist infinitely many primitive weird numbers, and Melfi has shown that the infinitude of primitive weird numbers is a consequence of Cramér&#x27;s conjecture.
Primitive weird numbers with as many as 16 prime factors and 14712 digits have been found.

<text>Śruti or shruti (, , ) in Sanskrit means &quot;that which is heard&quot; and refers to the body of most authoritative, ancient religious texts comprising the central canon of Hinduism. Manusmriti states: &quot;Śrutistu vedo vijñeyaḥ&quot; (Devanagari: श्रुतिस्तु वेदो विज्ञेयः) meaning, &quot;Know that Vedas are Śruti&quot;. Thus, it includes the four Vedas including its four types of embedded texts—the Samhitas, the Upanishads, the Brahmanas and the Aranyakas. 

&quot;Śruti&quot;s has been variously described as a revelation through &quot;anubhava&quot; (direct experience), or of primordial origins realized by ancient Rishis. In Hindu tradition, they have been referred to as &quot;apauruṣeya&quot; (not created by humans). The &quot;Śruti&quot; texts themselves assert that they were skillfully created by Rishis (sages), after inspired creativity, just as a carpenter builds a chariot.

All six schools of Hinduism accept the authority of &quot;śruti&quot;, but many scholars in these schools have denied that the &quot;śruti&quot;s are divine. A popular quote on supreme authority is Śruti can be found in Manusmriti (Adhyaya 1, Mantra 132) that &quot;Dharmaṃ jijñāsamānānāṃ pramāṇaṃ paramaṃ śrutiḥ&quot; (Devanagari: धर्मं जिज्ञासमानानां प्रमाणं परमं श्रुतिः, lit. means &quot;To those who seek the knowledge of the sacred law, the supreme authority is the revelation &quot;Śruti&quot;.&quot;

Shruti (&quot;Śruti&quot;) differs from other sources of Hindu philosophy, particularly &quot;smṛti&quot; &quot;which is remembered&quot; or textual material. These works span much of the history of Hinduism, beginning with the earliest known texts and ending in the early historical period with the later Upanishads. Of the &quot;śruti&quot;s, the Upanishads alone are widely known, and the central ideas of the Upanishadic &quot;śruti&quot;s are at the spiritual core of Hindus.

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit word &quot;&quot; (, ) has multiple meanings depending on context. It means &quot;hearing, listening&quot;, a call to &quot;listen to a speech&quot;, any form of communication that is aggregate of sounds (news, report, rumour, noise, hearsay). The word is also found in ancient geometry texts of India, where it means &quot;the diagonal of a tetragon or hypotenuse of a triangle&quot;, and is a synonym of &quot;karna&quot;. The word &quot;śruti&quot; is also found in ancient Indian music literature, where it means &quot;a particular division of the octave, a quarter tone or interval&quot; out of twenty-two enumerated major tones, minor tones, and semitones. In music, it refers the smallest measure of sound a human being can detect, and the set of twenty-two &quot;śruti&quot; and forty four &quot;half Shruti&quot;, stretching from about 250 Hz to 500 Hz, is called the &quot;Shruti octave&quot;.

In scholarly works on Hinduism, &quot;śruti&quot; refers to ancient Vedic texts from India. Monier-Williams traces the contextual history of this meaning of &quot;śruti&quot; as, &quot;which has been heard or communicated from the beginning, sacred knowledge that was only heard and verbally transmitted from generation to generation, the Veda, from earliest Rishis (sages) in Vedic tradition. In scholarly literature, &quot;Śruti&quot; is also spelled as Shruti.

==Distinction between śruti and smṛti==
Smriti, literally meaning &quot;that which is remembered,&quot; refers to a body of Hindu texts usually attributed to an author. Traditionally written down but constantly revised, &quot;Smriti&quot; in contrast to Śrutis (the Vedic literature) considered authorless, which were transmitted verbally across the generations and fixed. &quot;Smriti&quot; is a derivative secondary work and is considered less authoritative than &quot;Śruti&quot; in Hinduism. While &quot;Śruti&quot; texts are fixed and their originals preserved better, each Smriti text exists in many versions, with many different readings. In ancient and medieval Hindu tradition, Smritis were considered fluid and freely rewritten by anyone.

Both śrutis and smṛtis represent categories of texts of different traditions of Hindu philosophy. According to Gokul Narang, the Sruti are asserted to be of divine origin in the mythologies of the Puranas. For the people living during the composition of the &quot;Vedas&quot; the names of the authors were well known. Ancient and medieval Hindu philosophers also did not think that śruti were divine, authored by God.

That &quot;Vedas&quot; were heard was a notion that was developed by the school or &quot;darsana&quot; of Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā. The Mīmāṃsā tradition, famous in Hindu tradition for its Sruti exegetical contributions, radically critiqued the notion and any relevance for concepts such as &quot;author&quot;, the &quot;sacred text&quot; or divine origins of &quot;Śruti&quot;; the Mimamsa school claimed that the relevant question is the meaning of the Sruti, values appropriate for human beings in it, and the commitment to it.

Nāstika philosophical schools such as the Cārvākas of the first millennium BCE did not accept the authority of the śrutis and considered them to be human works suffering from incoherent rhapsodies, inconsistencies and tautologies.

Smṛtis are to be human thoughts in response to the śrutis. Traditionally, all smṛtis are regarded to ultimately be rooted in or inspired by śrutis.

==Texts==
The śruti literature include the four Vedas:

*Rigveda
*Yajurveda
*Samaveda
*Atharvaveda

Each of these Vedas include the following texts, and these belong to the śruti canon:

*Samhitas
*Brahmanas
*Aranyakas
*Upanishads

The literature of the shakhas, or schools, further amplified the material associated with each of the four core traditions.

Of the above śrutis, the Upanishads are most widely known, and the central ideas of them are the spiritual foundation of Hinduism. Patrick Olivelle writes,
==Role in Hindu Law==
Shrutis have been considered the authority in Hinduism. Smṛtis, including the &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;, the &quot;Nāradasmṛti&quot; and the &quot;Parāśarasmṛti&quot;, are considered less authoritative than śrutis.

Only three of the four types of texts in the Vedas have behavioral precepts:
Bilimoria states the role of śruti in Hinduism has been inspired by &quot;the belief in a higher natural cosmic order (&quot;Rta&quot; succeeded later by the concept &quot;Dharma&quot;) that regulates the universe and provides the basis for its growth, flourishing and sustenance – be that of the gods, human beings, animals and eco-formations&quot;.

Levinson states that the role of śruti and smṛti in Hindu law is as a source of guidance, and its tradition cultivates the principle that &quot;the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad&quot;. The later Hindu texts include fourfold sources of dharma, states Levinson, which include &quot;atmanastushti&quot; (satisfaction of one&#x27;s conscience), &quot;sadacara&quot; (local norms of virtuous individuals), smṛti and śruti.

==Transmission==
The śrutis, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE, had not been committed to writing in ancient times. These were developed and transmitted verbally, from one generation to the next, for nearly two millenniums. Almost all printed editions available in the modern era are copied manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years. Michael Witzel explains this oral tradition as follows:

Ancient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of śrutis. Many forms of recitation or &quot;pathas&quot; were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the &quot;Vedas&quot; and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the Principal Upanishads, as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:
* &quot;Samhita-patha&quot;: continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* &quot;Pada-patha&quot;: a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* &quot;Krama-patha&quot;: a step-by-step recitation where euphonically-combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn &quot;word1 word2 word3 word4...&quot;, would be recited as &quot;word1word2 word2word3 word3word4 ...&quot;; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakalya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* &quot;Krama-patha&quot; modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* &#x27;, &#x27; and &quot;&quot; are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound. That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the &quot;&quot; ( 1500 BCE).

This part of a Vedic student&#x27;s education was called svādhyāya. The systematic method of learning, memorization and practice, enabled these texts to be transmitted from generation to generation with inordinate fidelity.

<text>Ilkley Moor is part of Rombalds Moor, the moorland between Ilkley and Keighley in West Yorkshire, England. The moor, which rises to 402 m (1,319 ft) above sea level, is well known as the inspiration for the Yorkshire &quot;county anthem&quot; &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot; (dialect for &#x27;on Ilkley Moor without a hat&#x27;).

== Geology ==
During the Carboniferous period (325 million years ago), Ilkley Moor was part of a sea-level swampy area fed by meandering river channels coming from the north. The layers in the eroded bank faces of stream gullies in the area represent sea levels with various tides depositing different sorts of sediment. Over a long period, the sediments were cemented and compacted into hard rock layers. Geological forces lifted and tilted the strata a little towards the south-east, producing many small fractures, or faults.
Since the end of the Carboniferous period more than a thousand metres of coal-bearing rocks have been completely removed from the area by erosion. During the last million years, Ice Age glaciers modified the shape of the Wharfe valley, deepening it, smoothing it, and leaving behind glacial debris.
The millstone grit not only gives character to the town of Ilkley but gives the area its acid soils, heather moors, soft water, and rocky scars.

== History ==

To the north, where the moor drops steeply towards the village of Ben Rhydding, a satellite of the town of Ilkley, are two millstone grit rock climbing areas: Rocky Valley and Ilkley Quarry.

Ilkley Quarry is the site of the famous &quot;Cow and Calf&quot;, a large rock formation consisting of an outcrop and boulder, also known as Hangingstone Rocks. The rocks are made of millstone grit, a variety of sandstone, and are so named because one is large, with the smaller one sitting close to it, like a cow and . Legend has it that there was once also a &quot;bull&quot;, but that was quarried for stone during the spa town boom that Ilkley was part of in the 19th century. However, none of the local historians have provided any evidence of the Bull&#x27;s existence.

According to legend, the Calf was split from the Cow when the giant Rombald was fleeing an enemy and stamped on the rock as he leapt across the valley. The enemy, it is said, was his angry wife. She dropped the stones held in her skirt to form the local rock formation The Skirtful of Stones.

In July 2006 a major fire on the moor left between a quarter and half of it destroyed.

The BBC Television series &quot;Gunpowder&quot; (2017) used Ilkley Moor as a location.

===Swastika Stone and other antiquities===
On the Woodhouse Crag on the northern edge of Ilkley Moor is a swastika-shaped pattern engraved in a stone, known as the Swastika Stone, also referred to as a fylfot. The image at the bottom-right of the picture is a 20th-century replica; the original carving can be seen at the bottom left.

This stone is just one of many carved rocks on the moor; well-known others include the &#x27;Badger Stone&#x27;, &#x27;Nebstone&#x27;, and &#x27;St Margaret&#x27;s Stones&#x27;. These are earthfast boulders, large flat slabs, or prominent rocks that have cups, rings, and grooves cut into them and that are thought to date from either the late Neolithic or the Bronze Age. While some carvings consist of simple cups, others, such as the Badger Stone, Hanging Stones, and the Panorama Rocks, have a complex series of patterns (or motifs) combining many different elements. Rombald&#x27;s Moor has the second-highest concentration of ancient carved stones in Europe, with carvings as far away as Skipton Moor. There is also a small stone circle known as The Twelve Apostles.

=== &quot;The Ilkley Moor Alien&quot; sighting===
On 1 December 1987, Phillip Spencer, a retired policeman, saw and photographed what he believed was an alien being on the moor. He said he saw the strange creature rush up the hill and give a signal to him with one of its arms as if telling him not to approach. He later saw a dome-topped craft at the top of the hill after following the being which shot into the air at a blinding speed. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; included this event in a 2011 list of &quot;Top 10 UFO incidents in the UK&quot;.

== Conservation ==
The moor forms part of the South Pennine Moors Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It also forms part of the South Pennine Moors Special Protection Area (SPA) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC).

The Friends of Ilkley Moor group was founded in 2008 and works with partners to preserve the moor.

== Grouse shooting controversy ==
In 2008, Bradford Metropolitan District Council leased the grouse shooting rights for Ilkley Moor. This move led to controversy because of concerns about its impact on wildlife, walking, leisure and local tourism. In January 2018, the majority Labour group on the Council resolved not to renew the rights, and the grouse shooting ceased in April 2018.

<doc id="321934" wikidata="Q840548" url="?curid=321934" title="Smṛti">
<text>(, , ), also spelled , smruti, is a body of Hindu texts representing the remembered, written tradition in Hinduism, rooted in or inspired by the Vedas. works are generally attributed to a named author and were transmitted through manuscripts, in contrast to Vedic or literature, which is based on a fixed text with no specific author, and preserved through oral transmission. are derivative, secondary works and considered less authoritative than in Hinduism, except in the Mīmāmsa school of Hindu philosophy. The authority of accepted by orthodox schools is derived from that of , on which it is based.

The literature is a corpus of varied texts that includes: the six (the auxiliary sciences in the Vedas), the epics (the and ), the and (or ), the , the , the or poetical literature, extensive (reviews and commentaries on and non- texts), and numerous (digests) covering politics, ethics (), culture, arts and society.

Each text exists in many versions, with many different readings. works were considered fluid and freely rewritten by anyone in ancient and medieval Hindu tradition.

==Etymology==
&quot;&quot; is a Sanskrit word, from the root √smṛ (स्मृ), which means the act of remembering. The word is found in ancient Vaidika literature, such as in section 7.13 of the Chandogya Upanishad. In later and modern scholarly usage, the term refers to tradition, memory, as well as a vast post-Vedic canon of &quot;tradition that is remembered&quot;. David Brick states that the original meaning of smriti was simply tradition, and not texts.

&quot;Smṛti&quot; is also a symbolic synonym for number 18, from the 18 scholars who are credited in Indian tradition for writing dharma-related &quot;Smṛti&quot; texts (most have been lost). These 18 &quot;Smṛtis&quot; are namely, 
# Atri
# Viṣṇu
# Hārīta
# Auśanasī
# Āngirasa
# Yama
# Āpastamba
# Saṁvartta
# Kātyāyana
# Bṛhaspati
# Parāśara
# Vyāsa
# Śaṅkha
# Likhita 
# Dakṣa
# Gautama
# Śātātapa
# Vaśiṣṭha

Yājñavalkya gives the list of total 20 by adding two more &quot;Smṛtis&quot;, namely, &quot;Yājñavalkyasmṛti&quot; and &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;. Parāśara whose name appears in this list, enumerates also twenty authors, but instead of Samvartta, Bṛhaspati, and Vyāsa, he gives the names of Kaśyapa, Bhṛgu and Prachetas.

The Vedic sage Shandilya is also credited for a Smriti text called as Shandilya Smriti. The modern scholar &quot;Brahma Dutt Shastri&quot; had compiled the text Shandilya Smriti in his six volumes series work &quot;Smriti Sandarbha&quot;.

In linguistic traditions, &quot;Smṛti&quot; is the name of a type of verse meter. In Hindu mythology, &quot;Smṛti&quot; is the name of the daughter of &quot;Dharma&quot; () and &quot;Medha&quot; ().

==Texts==
&quot;Smṛtis&quot; represent the remembered, written tradition in Hinduism. The Smrti literature is a vast corpus of derivative work. All &quot;Smṛti&quot; texts are regarded to ultimately be rooted in or inspired by &quot;Shruti&quot;.

The &quot;Smṛti&quot; corpus includes, but is not limited to:
#The six Vedāngas (grammar, meter, phonetics, etymology, astronomy and rituals),
#The Itihasa (), Epics (the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana),
#The texts on the four proper goals or aims of human life:
##Dharma: These texts discuss &quot;dharma&quot; from various religious, social, duties, morals and personal ethics perspective. Each of six major schools of Hinduism has its own literature on dharma. Examples include Dharma-sutras (particularly by Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhayana and Vāsiṣṭha) and Dharma-sastras (particularly Manusmṛti, Yājñavalkya Smṛti, Nāradasmṛti and Viṣṇusmṛti). At the personal dharma level, this includes many chapters of Yogasutras.
##Artha: Artha-related texts discuss &quot;artha&quot; from individual, social and as a compendium of economic policies, politics and laws. For example, the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; of Chanakya, the Kamandakiya Nitisara, Brihaspati Sutra, and Sukra Niti. Olivelle states that most Artha-related treatises from ancient India have been lost.
##Kama: These discuss arts, emotions, love, erotics, relationships and other sciences in the pursuit of pleasure. The Kamasutra of Vātsyāyana is most well known. Others texts include Ratirahasya, Jayamangala, Smaradipika, Ratimanjari, Ratiratnapradipika, Ananga Ranga among others.
##Moksha: These develop and debate the nature and process of liberation, freedom and spiritual release. Major treatises on the pursuit of moksa include the later Upanishads (early Upanishads are considered &quot;Sruti&quot; literature), Vivekachudamani, and the sastras on Yoga.
#The Purānas (),
#The Kāvya or poetical literature,
#The extensive &quot;Bhasyas&quot; (reviews and commentaries on &quot;Shrutis&quot; and non-Shruti texts),
#The sutras and shastras of the various schools of Hindu philosophy
#The numerous &quot;Nibandhas&quot; (digests) covering politics, medicine (&quot;Charaka Samhita&quot;), ethics (&quot;Nitisastras&quot;), culture, arts and society.

=== The structure of &quot;Smṛti&quot; texts ===
The &quot;Smṛti&quot; texts structurally branched, over time, from so-called the &quot;limbs of the Vedas&quot;, or auxiliary sciences for perfecting grammar and pronunciation (part of Vedāngas). For example, the attempt to perfect the art of rituals led to the science of &quot;Kalpa&quot;, which branched into three Kalpa-sūtras: Srauta-sūtras, Grhya-sūtras, and Dharma-sūtras (estimated to have been composed between 600-200 BCE). The Srauta-sutras became texts describing the perfect performance of public ceremonies (solemn community yajnas), the Grhya-sutras described perfect performance of home ceremonies and domestic rites of passage, and Dharma-sutras described jurisprudence, rights and duties of individuals in four Ashrama stages of life, and social ethics. The Dharma-sūtras themselves became the foundations for a large canon of texts, and branched off as numerous Dharma-sastra texts.

Jan Gonda states that the initial stages of &quot;Smṛti&quot; texts structurally developed in the form of a new prose genre named Sūtras, that is &quot;aphorism, highly compact precise expression that captured the essence of a fact, principle, instruction or idea&quot;. This brevity in expression, states Gonda, was likely necessitated by the fact that writing technology had not developed yet or was not in vogue, in order to store a growing mass of knowledge, and all sorts of knowledge was transferred from one generation to the next through the process of memorization, verbal recitation and listening in the 1st millennium BCE. Compressed content allowed more essential, densely structured knowledge to be memorized and verbally transferred to the next generation in ancient India.

== Role of &quot;Smṛti&quot; in Hindu Law ==
&quot;Smṛtis&quot; contribute to exposition of the Hindu Dharma but are considered less authoritative than &quot;Śrutis&quot; (the Vedic corpus that includes early Upanishads).

=== Earliest &quot;Smṛti&quot; on Hindu Law: Dharma-sūtras ===
The root texts of ancient Hindu jurisprudence and law are the &quot;Dharma-sūtras&quot;. These express that Shruti, &quot;Smṛti&quot; and Acara are sources of jurisprudence and law. The precedence of these sources is declared in the opening verses of each of the known, surviving Dharma-sūtras. For example,
=== Later &quot;Smṛti&quot; on Hindu Law: Dharma-smriti ===
The &quot;Smṛtis&quot;, such as &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;, &quot;Naradasmṛti&quot;, &quot;Yājñavalkyasmṛti&quot; and &quot;Paraśarasmṛti&quot;, expanded this definition, as follows,

The Yajnavalkya &quot;Smṛti&quot; includes four Vedas, six Vedangas, Purana, Nyaya, Mimamsa and other sastras, in addition to the ethical conduct of the wise, as sources of knowledge and through which sacred law can be known. It explains the scope of the Dharma as follows,

Levinson states that the role of &quot;Shruti&quot; and &quot;Smṛti&quot; in Hindu law is as a source of guidance, and its tradition cultivates the principle that &quot;the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad&quot;. The later Hindu texts include fourfold sources of &quot;Dharma&quot;, states Levinson, which include &quot;Atmanastushti&quot; (satisfaction of one&#x27;s conscience), &quot;Sadacara&quot; (local norms of virtuous individuals), &quot;Smriti&quot; and &quot;Sruti&quot;.

===Bhasya on Dharma-smriti===
Medhatithi&#x27;s philosophical analysis of and commentary on criminal, civil and family law in Dharmaśāstras, particularly of Manusmriti, using Nyaya and Mimamsa theories, is the oldest and the most widely studied tertiary &quot;Smṛti&quot;.

<doc id="321935" wikidata="Q7091019" url="?curid=321935" title="On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at">
<text>&quot;On Ilkla Mooar Baht &#x27;at&quot; (Standard English: &quot;On Ilkley Moor without a hat&quot;) is a folk song from Yorkshire, England. It is sung in the Yorkshire dialect, and is considered the official anthem of Yorkshire. It is sung to the hymn tune &quot;Cranbrook&quot;, composed by Thomas Clark in 1805; while according to Andrew Gant, the words were composed by members of Halifax Church Choir &quot;some 50 years after Clark wrote his melody&quot;, on an outing to Ilkley Moor near Ilkley, West Yorkshire. It is classified as numbers 2143 and 19808 in the Roud Folk Song Index.

==Theme==
The song tells of a lover courting the object of his affections, Mary Jane, on Ilkley Moor without a hat (&quot;baht &#x27;at&quot;). The singer chides the lover for his lack of headwear – for in the cold winds of Ilkley Moor this will mean his death from exposure. This will in turn result in his burial, the eating of his corpse by worms, the eating of the worms by ducks and finally the eating of the ducks by the singers.

In &quot;The Yorkshire Dictionary&quot; (Arnold Kellett, 2002) it was said the song (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the lyrics) probably originated from the Halifax area, based on the dialect which is not common to all areas of Yorkshire.

The title is seen in various transcriptions of the dialect, but is most commonly &quot;On Ilkla Mooar [or Moor] baht &#x27;at&quot;, i.e. &quot;On Ilkley Moor without [wearing] thy (your) hat&quot;. Dr. Arnold Kellett reports the traditional belief that the song &quot;came into being as a result of an incident that took place during a ramble and picnic on the moor. It is further generally believed that the ramblers were all on a chapel choir outing, from one of the towns in the industrial West Riding&quot;.

The first published version of the words appeared in 1916, when it was described as &quot;a dialect song which, for at least two generations past, has been sung in all parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire&quot;. Arnold Kellett judged that the song &quot;could well have originated in the early years of the second half of the [19th] century, and not as late as 1877&quot;.

==Tune==
It is sung to the Methodist hymn tune &quot;Cranbrook&quot; (composed by Canterbury-based shoemaker Thomas Clark in 1805); this was published by him in 1805 in &quot;A Sett of Psalm &amp; Hymn Tunes with some Select Pieces and an Anthem&quot;, setting the words of Philip Doddridge&#x27;s &quot;Grace! &#x27;Tis a Charming Sound&quot;. It was later used as a tune for &quot;While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night&quot;), but the &quot;Ilkla Moor&quot; song became so popular that the origin of the music as a hymn tune has been almost forgotten in the United Kingdom. 
It is still used for the traditional words &quot;While Shepherds Watched&quot; in some churches including Leeds Parish Church and St Aidan&#x27;s Church in Manor Parish, Sheffield, but no longer widely recognised as a hymn or carol tune in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Cranbrook&quot; continues in use as a hymn tune in the United States, where it was not adopted as the tune of a popular secular song and is customarily used with the lyrics of Philip Doddridge&#x27;s &quot;Grace! &#x27;Tis a Charming Sound&quot;.

== Collected versions ==
EFDSS director Douglas Kennedy collected a version in 1917 from a performer in Ilkley named Wilfred Hall, which was later printed in his son Peter Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;Folksongs of Britain &amp; Ireland&quot; (1975).

Several audio recordings have been made of traditional versions. Ken Stubbs recorded Albert Gartside of Delph in the West Riding singing the song in 1964, whilst Fred Hamer recorded William Bleasdale singing a version in the village of Chipping in Lancashire some time in the 1950s or 60s. The American folklorist Helen Hartness Flanders recorded a version in her hometown of Springfield, Vermont and another in Naushon Isle, Massachusetts in the 1940s, suggesting that the song had made its way to North America with immigrants from Yorkshire.

A new musical rendition of on Ilkla Moor Baht&#x27;at was produced in 2013 by Grammy award winning artist Eliot Kennedy, featuring Lesley Garrett and Brian Blessed rapping the song. The project was the brainchild of Clair Challenor-Chadwick at Cause UK Public Relations, stemming from the idea that Yorkshire children didn&#x27;t know the song. The song also features community choir Rock Up and Sing and &quot;Fame Academy&quot; singer Alistair Griffin, the Grimethorpe Colliery Band and &quot;The X Factor&quot; singer and Yorkshire Regiment soldier Jonjo Kerr.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics consist of a sequence of similar verses, each consisting of seven lines, with one mutable element: while the first, third and fourth lines are the same in each verse, they change with each following verse. In these lines, the words on the last two beats are repeated in the first and third lines, but not in the fourth line. The other lines do not change; all verses feature the same second, fifth, sixth and seventh lines, &quot;On Ilkla Mooar baht &#x27;at&quot;.

The lyrics include many features of the Yorkshire dialect such as definite article reduction, H-dropping, and traditional second-person singular pronouns.

Many sources give the first line as &quot;&quot;Wheear wor-ta bahn when Ah saw thee?&quot; (Where were you going when I saw you), though &quot;Wheear es-ta bin sin Ah saw thee&quot;&quot; is the more common version nowadays.

Some singers add the responses &quot;without tha trousers on&quot; after the fourth line of each verse, and &quot;where the ducks play football&quot; after the seventh. Other variations include &quot;where the nuns play rugby&quot;, &quot;where the sheep fly backwards&quot;, &quot;where the ducks fly backwards&quot;, &quot;where the ducks wear trousers&quot;, &quot;an&#x27; they&#x27;ve all got spots&quot;, and &quot;where they&#x27;ve all got clogs on&quot;.

Also in some recitals, after the first two lines of &quot;On Ilkla Mooar baht &#x27;at&quot; it is followed by a &quot;Where&#x27;s that?&quot; Another variant adds &quot;Howzat?&quot; after the first line and &quot;Not out!&quot; after the second. In Leeds the line immediately before the chorus is often ended with &quot;And we all got wet&quot;. In the United States, &quot;Then we will go and eat up the ducks&quot; is often followed by a shouted &quot;Up the Ducks!&quot;

There are also alternative endings, where verse nine states: &quot;There is a moral to this tale&quot;, and is followed by a chorus of &quot;Don&#x27;t go without your hat / Don&#x27;t go without your hat / On Ilkey moor baht &#x27;at&quot; (which is sung commonly within West Yorkshire), or &quot;Don&#x27;t go a courtin&#x27; Mary Jane&quot; (another variation known in the Scouting movement). Alternatively, verse nine is sung as &quot;There is a moral to this tale&quot;, and verse ten as &quot;When courtin&#x27; always wear a hat&quot;.

<text>In recreational number theory, a primeval number is a natural number &quot;n&quot; for which the number of prime numbers which can be obtained by permuting some or all of its digits (in base 10) is larger than the number of primes obtainable in the same way for any smaller natural number. Primeval numbers were first described by Mike Keith.

The first few primeval numbers are
:1, 2, 13, 37, 107, 113, 137, 1013, 1037, 1079, 1237, 1367, 1379, 10079, 10123, 10136, 10139, 10237, 10279, 10367, 10379, 12379, 13679, ... 
The number of primes that can be obtained from the primeval numbers is
:0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26, 29, 31, 33, 35, 41, 53, 55, 60, 64, 89, 96, 106, ... 
The largest number of primes that can be obtained from a primeval number with &quot;n&quot; digits is
:1, 4, 11, 31, 106, 402, 1953, 10542, 64905, 362451, 2970505, ... 
The smallest &quot;n&quot;-digit number to achieve this number of primes is
:2, 37, 137, 1379, 13679, 123479, 1234679, 12345679, 102345679, 1123456789, 10123456789, ... 

Primeval numbers can be composite. The first is 1037 = 17×61. A Primeval prime is a primeval number which is also a prime number:
:2, 13, 37, 107, 113, 137, 1013, 1237, 1367, 10079, 10139, 12379, 13679, 100279, 100379, 123479, 1001237, 1002347, 1003679, 1012379, ... 

The following table shows the first seven primeval numbers with the obtainable primes and the number of them.

==Base 12==

In base 12, the primeval numbers are: (using inverted two and three for ten and eleven, respectively)
:1, 2, 13, 15, 57, 115, 117, 125, 135, 157, 1017, 1057, 1157, 1257, 125Ɛ, 157Ɛ, 167Ɛ, ...

The number of primes that can be obtained from the primeval numbers is: (written in base 10)
:0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 20, 23, 27, 29, 33, 35, ...

Note that 13, 115 and 135 are composite: 13 = 3×5, 115 = 7×1Ɛ, and 135 = 5×31.

<doc id="321940" wikidata="Q1627122" url="?curid=321940" title="Honeypot ant">
<text>Honeypot ants, also called honey ants, are ants which have specialized workers (repletes, plerergates, or rotunds) that consume large amounts of food to the point that their abdomens swell enormously. Other ants then extract nourishment from them, through the process of trophallaxis. They function as living larders. Honeypot ants belong to any of several genera, including &quot;Myrmecocystus&quot; and &quot;Camponotus&quot;. They were first documented in 1881 by Henry C. McCook, and described further in 1908 by William Morton Wheeler.

==Behavior==

Many insects, notably honey bees and some wasps, collect and store liquid for use at a later date. However, these insects store their food within their nest or in combs. Honey ants are unique in using their own bodies as living storage, used later by their fellow ants when food is otherwise scarce. When the liquid stored inside a honeypot ant is needed, the worker ants stroke the antennae of the honeypot ant, causing the honeypot ant to regurgitate the stored liquid from its crop.

==Anatomy==
The abdomen of species like &quot;Camponotus inflatus&quot; consists of hard dorsal sclerites (stiff plates) connected by a softer, more flexible arthrodial membrane. When the abdomen is empty, the arthrodial membrane is folded and the sclerites overlap, but when the abdomen fills the arthrodial membrane becomes fully stretched, leaving the sclerites widely separated.

==Ecology==

&quot;Myrmecocystus&quot; nests are found in a variety of arid or semiarid environments. Some species live in extremely hot deserts, others reside in transitional habitats, and still other species can be found in woodlands which are somewhat cool but still very dry for a large part of the year. For instance, the well-studied &quot;Myrmecocystus mexicanus&quot; resides in the arid and semiarid habitats of the southwestern United States. Sterile workers in this species act as plerergates or repletes during times of food scarcity. When the plerergates are fully engorged, they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of the underground nests. Other workers drain them of their liquid food stores to feed the rest of the colony. Plerergates can live anywhere in the nest, but in the wild, they are found deep underground, unable to move, swollen to the size of grapes.

In &quot;Camponotus inflatus&quot; in Australia, repletes formed 49% (516 ants) of a colony of 1063 ants, and 46% (1835 ants) of a colony of 4019 ants. The smaller colony contained six wingless queens. The larger colony had 66 chambers containing repletes, with a maximum of 191 repletes in a chamber. The largest replete was 15 millimetres long and had a mass of 1.4 grams. The nest had a maximum depth of 1.7 metres, and tunnels stretched 2.4 metres from the nest entrance. The workers went out foraging during daylight to collect nectar from &quot;Mulga&quot; nectaries, and meat from the carcass of a &quot;Tiliqua&quot; blue-tongued lizard.

==Genera==
Honeypot food storage has been adopted in several seasonally active ant genera:
* &quot;Camponotus&quot; of Australia
* &quot;Cataglyphis&quot; of North Africa
* &quot;Leptomyrmex&quot; of Melanesia
* &quot;Melophorus&quot; of Australia
* &quot;Myrmecocystus&quot; of North America.
* &quot;Plagiolepis&quot; of South Africa 
* &quot;Prenolepis&quot; of North America
==In human culture==

Honeypot ants such as &quot;Melophorus bagoti&quot; and &quot;Camponotus&quot; spp. are edible insects and form an occasional part of the diet of various Indigenous Australians. These people scrape the surface to locate the ants&#x27; vertical tunnels, and then dig as much as two metres deep to find the honeypots. Papunya, in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory, is named after a honey ant creation story, or Dreaming, which belongs to the people there, such as the Warlpiri. The honey ants were celebrated in the Western Desert Art Movement&#x27;s &quot;The Honey Ant Mural&quot;, painted in 1971.
===Indigenous medicinal use===
Indigenous Australians from the Tjupan language group use honeypot ant honey to treat sore throats, and as a topical ointment to treat skin infections. A Sydney University study has investigated the efficacy of honey from &quot;Camponotus inflatus&quot;, and found it effective against the bacterium &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and the fungi &quot;Aspergillus&quot; and &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;. The antimicrobial mechanism is significantly different to that of Mānuka honey.

<text>Elbasan ( , ; , ) is the fourth most populous city of Albania and seat of Elbasan County and Elbasan Municipality. It lies to the north of the river Shkumbin between the Skanderbeg Mountains and the Myzeqe Plain in central Albania.

== Etymology ==

The name (in the form also in Aromanian) is derived from the Ottoman Turkish (&quot;the fortress&quot;).

== History ==

In August 2010 archaeologists discovered two Illyrian graves near the walls of the castle of Elbasan.

In the second century BC, a Roman trading post recorded in Latin as &quot;Mansio Scampa&quot; (also in ) near the site of modern Elbasan developed close to a junction of two branches of an important Roman road, the Via Egnatia, which connected the Adriatic coast with Byzantium. It was one of the most important routes of the Roman Empire. By the third or fourth century AD, this place had grown into a real city protected by a substantial Roman fortress with towers; the fort covered around 300 square meters. This city appears on late antique itineraries like the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot; and &quot;Itinerarium Burdigalense&quot; as &quot;Scampis&quot; or &quot;Hiscampis&quot;.

It took part in the spread of Christianity along the Via, and had a bishop, cathedral and basilicas as early as the fifth century. As a town in a wide river valley it was vulnerable to attacks once the legions were withdrawn but Emperor Justinian made an effort to improve the fortifications. The city survived attacks by the Bulgars and Ostrogoths and was mentioned in the work of Procopius of Cæsarea. Ruins of a Paleochristian basilica, built in the 5th or 6th century AD, were found in Bezistan area.

The site seems to have been abandoned until the Ottoman army built a military camp there, followed by urban reconstruction under Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror in 1466. Mehmet constructed a massive four-sided castle with a deep moat and three gates. The name Elbasan is thought to mean &#x27;the flat fortress&#x27; in Albanian or ‘the flat province’ in Turkish. He had built the castle in order to fight Skanderbeg, due to an ongoing conflict between the Ottomans and Albanians. 


It became the seat of Sanjak of Elbasan, a centre of Ottoman urban civilisation over the next 445 years. Although Halil Inalcik explains that the Sanjak of Elbasan was established as soon as the fortress of Elbasan was constructed in 1466, based on Tursun Beg&#x27;s records there is a possibility that Elbasan initially was part of the Sanjak of Ohrid. In 1467 many Christians from Skopje, Ohrid, Serres and Kastoria were forcibly deported to Elbasan. In the late 17th century, the Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi passed through Elbasan and noted that &quot;all the inhabitants speak Albanian&quot; having knowledge of Turkish with Muslim clergy being literate in Persian, while merchants also used the Greek and &quot;Frankish&quot; languages.

By the end of the 17th century it had 2,000 inhabitants. The fortress was dismantled by Reshit Pasha in 1832.In 1864, the Sanjak of Elbasan became a part of Monastir Vilayet. In the late nineteenth century, Elbasan was inhabited by 3,000 Muslim families and 280 Orthodox Christian families, of which 100 were old Orthodox Albanian families living in the old Christian neighbourhood within the fortress and 180 Aromanian families residing in the St. Nicholas neighbourhood on the edge of town. At the beginning of the 20th century it was estimated that 15,000 people lived in Elbasan.

In 1909, after the Young Turks revolution in Istanbul, an Albanian National Congress was held in Elbasan to study educational and cultural questions. The delegates, all from central and southern Albania, endorsed the decision of the Congress of Monastir, which was held in Monastir (modern Bitola, North Macedonia) to use the Latin alphabet rather than the Arabic script in written Albanian. Albanians, Turks, Aromunians and Sephardic Jews were living in Elbasan.

Before the Second World War, Elbasan was a city with a mixture of eastern and medieval buildings, narrow cobbled streets and a large bazaar. There was a clearly defined Muslim settlement within the castle walls, an Aromanian district on the outskirts of the city and several fine mosques and Islamic buildings. At the time the population was about 15,000 people.

The very first teachers&#x27; training college in Albania, the Shkolla Normale e Elbasanit, was established in Elbasan. During First Balkan War, it was occupied by Serbian troops on 29 November 1912. They withdrew from Elbasan on 25 October 1913 due to United Kingdom and Austria Hungary&#x27;s ultimatum. The Muslim majority of Elbasan opposed the installation of Prince Wied in 1914. Elbasan was occupied successively by Serbs, Bulgarians, Austrians and Italians between 1915 and 1918. The Bulgarian army occupied Elbasan on January 29, 1916, during Bulgarian occupation of Albania In March 1916 the army of Austria-Hungary took over control of Elbasan From June 1916 to March 1917 Stanislav Kostka Neumann fought with the Austrian army there and called his war memoirs about the occupation in &quot;Elbasan&quot;. Industrial development began in the Zogist period when tobacco and alcohol factories were established.

The city was also noted for its good public buildings, advanced educational provisions, public gardens and timber-built shops. There was much wartime damage, which was followed by an intensive programme of industrial development in the Communist period that boosted the city to around 75,000 inhabitants. The culmination of this process was the construction of the huge &quot;Steel of the Party&quot; () metallurgical complex outside the city, in the Shkumbini valley, built with Chinese assistance in the 1970s. It was emphatically called &quot;The Second National Liberation of Albanian&quot; by Enver Hoxha. The cost of the complex in environmental impact was high for the Shkumbin valley. Elbasan Railway Station was opened in 1950. In 2014, the Albanian government reconstructed former Ruzhdi Bizhuta Stadium. The renovated Elbasan Arena became the home stadium of the Albania national football team and Albania&#x27;s de facto stadium meeting FIFA&#x27;s criteria.

== Geography ==

The city of Elbasan lies to the north of the river Shkumbin between the Skanderbeg Mountains and the Myzeqe Plain in central Albania. The municipality of Elbasan consists of the administrative units of Bradashesh, Funarë, Gjergjan, Gjinar, Gracen, Labinot-Fushë, Labinot-Mal, Papër, Shirgjan, Shushicë, Tregan, Zavalinë and Elbasan. It covers 872.03 km2.

=== Climate ===

According to the Köppen climate classification, Elbasan has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) with an average annual temperature of .

== Economy ==

Industrial development began during the Zog regime with the production of tobacco and alcoholic beverages, and culminated during the communist regime. The city gained prominence after the Chinese built a steel mill in 1974. One travel writer relayed from conversation that during the communist regime, &quot;almost everyone in the country seemed to have a gun, likely manufactured by this Chinese-financed factory in Elbasan,&quot; and the &quot;country did not seem to have tractors, ploughs, or sewing machines.&quot;

The city also hosts a ferrochrome smelter, which was commissioned in 1989 by the communist regime and now is owned by the Balfin Group.

The city was a hub for heavy industry during the communist regime, mostly metallurgic and metal processing factories. All these industries caused big pollution and Elbasan is considered today to be one of the most polluted cities of Albania.

In recent years Elbasan, like the rest of Albania, has had to deal not only with local pollution, but also with what environmentalists call &quot;imported pollution&quot;, because of the waste imported from abroad for the recycling process in private companies.

== Demography ==
The population of the municipality of Elbasan as of the 2023 census is 115,101, of which 66,834 is in the municipal unit.

== Culture ==


Elbasan has been occupied by several different groups, including the Serbs, Bulgarians, Austrians and Italians. Elbasan remained a center of Christianity in Albania even after the Ottoman occupation. After the 1908 Congress of Monastir (in modern Bitola, North Macedonia) decided to use the Latin alphabet for the written Albanian language, Muslim clerics influenced by the Ottoman Empire held various demonstrations in favor of the Arabic script in Elbasan.

In the center of the city, is located the Saint Mary Orthodox Church. The church was built in 1830 on the foundations of an older church, which had partially burned in 1819. Paintings and frescoes of Onufri, restored by David Selenicasi and Kostadin Shelcani can still be seen. The church has been an important religious and cultural center for the Albanian language. Teodor Haxhifilipi, Kostandin Kristoforidhi, and Aleksandër Xhuvani have served in the church. They are the authors of translations into Albanian of many psalms. The church building served as the first Albanian school of Elbasan in modern times, which opened in 1909.

Other orthodox churches in the Elbasan District include the Mameli church (built in the 17th century), the Saint Nicholas church () in Shelcan (built in 1554), the Saint Nicholas church in Valesh (built in 1604), the Saints Cosmas and Damian church in Sterstan (built in the 18th century), the Saint Michael () church in Shalës (built in the 17th century), the Saint Mary church in Dragot (built in the 18th century), the Saint Nicholas church of Elbasan (17th century), and the Elbasan Saint Athanasius church of Elbasan (built in 1554).

About 7 km away from Elbasan is the location of the orthodox Saint John Vladimir&#x27;s Church (Albanian: &quot;Kisha e Shën Gjon Vlladimirit&quot;) built by Albanian monarch Karl Thopia and his son Gjergj Thopia in 1381. Notably, Saint Jovan Vladimir was buried at the church until 1995 when his remains were transferred to the Orthodox Cathedral in Tirana, being brought back to the monastery only for his feast days.

Elbasan is home to the National Autocephalous Albanian Church (), a relatively new Orthodox Autocephalous church that split from the Albanian Orthodox Church in 1995. Father Nikolle Marku is the leader of the new denomination.

Elbasan is also home to a Catholic church.

Elbasan has four museums:
*Ethnographic Museum (1982) held in an 18th-century building
*“Kostandin Kristoforidhi” house (started as a museum in 1978)
*&quot;Shkolla Normale&quot; Museum
*War Museum

Elbasan is home to the Summer Day festivities, a pagan feast celebrating the end of winter and the coming of summer. &quot;Ballokume&quot;, a kind of cookie made with butter and cornmeal among other ingredients, is the traditional dessert served on this day. Since 2004, it has become a national holiday being celebrated nationwide, in all Albania.

<text>Sky UK Limited, trading as Sky, is a British broadcaster and telecommunications company that provides television, internet, fixed line and mobile telephone services to consumers and businesses in the United Kingdom. It is a subsidiary of Sky Group and, from 2018 onwards, part of Comcast. It is the UK&#x27;s largest pay-TV broadcaster, with 12.7 million customers as of the end of 2019 for its digital satellite TV platform. Sky&#x27;s flagship products are Sky Q and the internet-based Sky Glass, and its flagship channels are Sky Showcase, Sky Max, and Sky Atlantic.

Formed as British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) in November 1990 through the merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting, it grew into a major media company by the end of the decade, notably owning all the television broadcasting rights for the Premier League and almost all the domestic rights of Hollywood films. Following BSkyB&#x27;s acquisition of Sky Italia and a majority interest in Sky Deutschland in 2014, its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc (now Sky Group Limited). The UK subsidiary&#x27;s name was changed from British Sky Broadcasting Limited to Sky UK Limited, and continuing to trade as &quot;Sky&quot;.

Sky UK Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast-owned Sky Group, with its current company directors (including that of Sky Ireland) being Executive Vice-president Stephen van Rooyen Its corporate headquarters are at the Sky Studios in Isleworth.

==History==
===Origins===
The present service can trace its heritage back to 1990, when BSkyB&#x27;s predecessors Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting encrypted their respective film channels – Sky Movies and The Movie Channel which required viewers to get decoding equipment and a subscription to watch the channels. After the two companies merged, subscribers could get access to both channels, and two years later, the sports channel Sky Sports also became encrypted.

===Premier League football===
In the autumn of 1991, talks were held for the broadcast rights for Premier League for five years, from the 1992 season. ITV were the current rights holders and fought hard to retain the new rights. ITV had increased its offer from £18m to £34m per year to keep control of the rights. BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid. The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches, while BSkyB paying £304m for the Premier League rights, would give them a monopoly of all live matches, up to 60 per year from the 1992 season. Murdoch described sport as a &quot;battering ram&quot; for pay television, providing a strong customer base. A few weeks after the deal, ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken. ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal. A few days later neither action took effect, ITV believed BSkyB was telephoned and informed of its £262m bid, and Premier League advised BSkyB to increase its counter bid.

BSkyB retained the rights paying £670m 1997–2001 deal, but was challenged by ONdigital for the rights from 2001 to 2004, thus were forced to £1.1 billion which gave them 66 live games a year.

Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission, which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer, BSkyB&#x27;s monopoly came to an end from the 2007–08 season. In May 2006, the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters. Sky picked up the remaining four for £1.3bn.
In February 2015, Sky bid £4.2bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016. This represented an increase of 70% on the previous contract and was said to be £1bn more than the company had expected to pay. The move has been followed by staff cuts, increased subscription prices (including 9% in Sky&#x27;s family package) and the dropping of the 3D channel.

===Sky Multichannels===
In September 1993, BSkyB launched Sky Multichannels which was the present digital platform&#x27;s analogue predecessor. Sky Multichannels was a subscription package that gave access not only to Sky&#x27;s channels but also to those of third-party broadcasters.

The service started on 1 September 1993. It was based on an idea by then CEO Sam Chisholm and chairman Rupert Murdoch of converting the company&#x27;s business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept. The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air, broadcasting on Astra&#x27;s satellites, as well as introducing new channels. The service continued until the closure of BSkyB&#x27;s analogue service on 27 September 2001, due to the expansion of the Sky Digital platform after its launch three years before. Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, without a subscription card) before their addition to the Sky Multichannels package. Within two months of the launch, BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers, with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well, which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994. Michael Grade criticised the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage, mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels.

===Launch of Sky Digital===
BSkyB&#x27;s digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then. At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made an important distinction between the new service and Sky&#x27;s analogue services. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open..., later called Sky Active. BSkyB competed with the ONdigital (later &quot;ITV Digital&quot;) terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which helped bolster BSkyB&#x27;s decision to give away free digiboxes and mini dishes from May 1999.

In addition to most channels from the Sky Multichannels package, many of which broadcast additional hours on Sky Digital, Sky Digital launched several new channels that were exclusive to the digital offer.

The switchover from analogue to digital proceeded relatively quickly. In 1998, there were 6 million &#x27;multichannel&#x27; TV homes in the UK (i.e. homes that watch television other than the traditional analogue terrestrial), and over half of these homes watched television using BSkyB&#x27;s analogue service. BSkyB&#x27;s digital service surpassed the analogue service in terms of subscribers in late 1999.

By June 2000 the service had 3.6 million subscribers, which gave BSkyB 8.988 million subscribers across all platforms. This substantial growth reflected BSkyB&#x27;s 34% share of viewers in multi-channel homes (up from 13.4% in 1999).

BSkyB&#x27;s analogue service ended in October 2001, and the digital service would eventually be marketed as just &#x27;Sky&#x27;.

By June 2005, the number of digital subscribers increase to 7.8m, while it produced 38,375 hours of sport in 2005.

In November 2005, in partnership with Vodafone, Sky Mobile TV was launched which was the UK&#x27;s first commercially available mobile TV service. Vodafone live! customers with 3G-enabled handsets would receive the service.

===2010s===
Sky&#x27;s direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010, Europe&#x27;s first pay-TV platform to achieve that milestone. Confirming it had reached its target, the broadcaster said its reach into 36% of households in the UK represented an audience of more than 25m people. The target was first announced in August 2004, and since then an additional 2.4 million customers had subscribed to Sky&#x27;s direct-to-home service. Media commentators had debated whether the figure could be reached as the growth in subscriber numbers elsewhere in Europe flattened.

In December, the UK&#x27;s parliament heard a claim that a subscription to Sky was &#x27;often damaging&#x27; to welfare recipients, along with alcohol, tobacco and gambling. Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was proposing the payments of benefits and tax credits on a &quot;Welfare Cash Card&quot;, in the style of the American Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, that could be used to buy only &quot;essentials&quot;.

In 2016, Sky launched its new TV and entertainment service called Sky Q.

On 1 March 2018, it was reported that Sky UK had concluded successful negotiations with Netflix to offer Sky subscribers access to its international streaming service.

Comcast, the largest cable TV provider in the United States, outbid 21st Century Fox, on 22 September 2018 in an auction for control of Sky UK. On 4 October 2018, Fox sold their stake to Comcast, giving the latter a 76.8% controlling stake. On 12 October 2018, Comcast announced it will compulsorily acquire the rest of Sky after its bid gained acceptance from 95.3% of the broadcaster&#x27;s shareholders with the company being delisted by early 2019. Sky was delisted on 7 November 2018 after Comcast acquired all remaining shares.

===2020s===

On 17 September 2020, Sky Arts became the first premium Sky channel to become available on the free to air terrestrial Freeview service, joining Sky News and a couple of channels which trace their lineage back to Flextech (Pick and Challenge).

On 28 July 2021, Sky announced that its flagship channel Sky One would shut down on 1 September, to be replaced by two channels; Sky Showcase, showing a mixture of content from other Sky Channels, and Sky Max, showing Sky&#x27;s original programming and entertainment previously shown on Sky One.

On 7 October 2021, Sky announced a new all-in-one TV set called Sky Glass. It is designed to support streaming of Sky TV and streaming service shows over WiFi, eliminating the need for a satellite dish or box. It launched on 18 October 2021, with three sizes available: 43-inch, 55-inch and 65-inch.

In October 2022, Comcast announced that it had written off 8.6 billion of its valuation of Sky, with its third-quarter sales dropping 14.7 percent to $4.3 bn 

== Internet service ==
=== History ===
In October 2005, Sky agreed to purchase the ISP EasyNet for £211 million. At the time, EasyNet were one of the few ISPs that had made major investments in local-loop unbundling (LLU), giving Sky access to 232 unbundled telephone exchanges. The acquired EasyNet was placed under a new Sky Broadband division. In October 2007, Sky reached 1 million broadband customers and claimed to be gained one new customer every 40 seconds. By September 2009, Sky Broadband had 2.3 million customers. By July 2012 Sky Broadband had reached four million customers and had unbundled exchanges covering over 70% of the United Kingdom. 

On 1 March 2013, it was announced that Sky would buy O2&#x27;s and Be&#x27;s broadband services from Telefónica for £180 million upfront plus another £20 million once customers have been transferred. Telefónica said the deal would allow it to concentrate on providing better mobile services, including rolling out 4G.

=== Network ===
Sky offers broadband using the Openreach network. Customer premises connect to the network using ADSL, FTTC and FTTP.

=== Sky Talk ===
Sky Talk is a fixed-line telephone service, with options for pay-as-you-go or bundled call minutes.

=== NOW Broadband ===
NOW Broadband is a brand name of low-cost broadband plans. It is associated with the Now over-the-top television service brand operated by Sky.

=== Additional services ===
Sky offer two security add-ons for Sky Broadband, Sky Broadband Shield and Sky Talk Shield. Sky Broadband Shield offers network-wide web filtering and security and Sky Talk Shield offers spam call blocking.

==Television==
===Digital terrestrial television===
Sky initially faced competition from the ONdigital digital terrestrial television service (later renamed ITV Digital). ITV Digital failed for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to numerous administrative and technical failures, nervous investors after a large downturn in the advertising market and the dot com crash, and Sky&#x27;s aggressive marketing and domination of premium sporting rights.

While Sky had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium, thereby making them a competitor by default, Sky was able to join ITV Digital&#x27;s free-to-air replacement, Freeview, in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Arqiva. Prior to October 2005, three Sky channels were available on this platform: Sky News, Sky Three, and Sky Sports News. Initially, Sky provided Sky Travel to the service. However, this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005, which was itself later re-branded as &#x27;Pick TV&#x27; in 2011.

On 8 February 2007, Sky announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels. It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the Sky portfolio including sports (including English Premier League Football), films, entertainment and news. The announcement came a day after Setanta Sports confirmed that it would launch in March as a subscription service on the digital terrestrial platform, and on the same day that NTL&#x27;s services re-branded as Virgin Media. However, industry sources believe Sky will be forced to shelve plans to withdraw its channels from Freeview and replace them with subscription channels, due to possible lost advertising revenue.

===Video on demand===

Sky initially faced increased competition from telecommunications providers to deliver pay television services over existing telephone lines using ADSL. Such providers are able to offer &quot;triple play&quot; or &quot;quadruple play&quot; packages combining landline telephone, broadband Internet, mobile telephone and pay television services.

To compete with these providers, in October 2005, Sky bought the broadband Internet service provider Easynet for £211 million. This acquisition allowed Sky to start offering a Sky-branded broadband service as well as a &quot;triple play&quot; package combining satellite television, land-line telephone and Broadband service. Sky also offers some streaming live TV channels to a computer using Microsoft&#x27;s Silverlight.

In early 2012, Sky released an update to its Sky Anytime service. This update offers customers the chance to buy and rent films from the Sky Store.

On 26 September 2012, Sky relaunched its &quot;Anytime+&quot; on-demand-via-broadband service as &quot;On Demand&quot; as the BBC&#x27;s iPlayer joined the line-up of channels offering catch-up TV on the company&#x27;s Sky+ HD box – linked to a router, the signal from which was recorded before viewing. The BBC was making the preceding week&#x27;s programmes available alongside ITV, Channel 4&#x27;s All 4, Channel 5 and the partly BBC Worldwide-owned UKTV, as well as Sky&#x27;s own channels.

===Sky Go===

Sky Go is provided free of charge for Sky (satellite TV) subscribers and allows them to watch channels live and on-demand through an internet connection on a computer or mobile device.

On 29 May 2009, it was confirmed that Sky Go would be made available on the Xbox 360. In November 2011 Sony Computer Entertainment struck a deal with Sky to bring some of its shows to the PlayStation Store Video Store. Users are able buy individual TV episodes in SD or HD. On 3 December 2014, Sky Go became available on the PlayStation 4 under the name &quot;TV from Sky&quot;, followed by the PlayStation 3 on 29 January 2015.

===Sky Store===

Sky Store has a library of films from Sky Cinema that can be rented or bought, either via an app or physical DVD/Blu-ray copies by post. Sky Store is available on Sky Q boxes as well as through apps on devices such as computers and mobile devices. It is available to anyone with a compatible device and does not require a Sky TV subscription.

===NOW ===

An over-the-top contract-free television service from Sky. The service is provided on a NOW device or through an app on selected computers, mobile devices, set-top boxes and smart TVs. NOW is separate from the core Sky TV service.

== Sky Mobile ==
On 21 October 2016, it was announced that public pre-registration for Sky&#x27;s new mobile network, Sky Mobile, would take place from 31 October 2016. The network will operate as a Full MVNO, utilising the O2 radio access network infrastructure, and O2&#x27;s full network speeds and 4G+.
On 5 January 2017 Sky Mobile went live to the public across the UK. Coining itself as the Smarter Network, with tariffs mainly focused on data rather than traditional calls &amp; text, effectively saving consumers money in wasted unused minutes and texts. 1GB data costs £10.00 per month while 5GB costs £15.00 per month with 10GB data costing £20.00 per month. With all those data tariffs, the customer can choose from two different call &amp; text packages with the &#x27;Pay as you use&#x27; costing 10p per minute of calls and 10p per text message sent or £10.00 per month for Unlimited Calls &amp; Texts. The Unlimited Calls &amp; Texts package is free for new or existing Sky TV customers using the Sky Mobile network. Since it was launched Sky has reduced the cost of its tariffs with, as of March 2021, 2GB now starting for £6.00 per month, 8GB for £10.00 per month, 10GB for £12.00 per month, 25GB for £15.00 per month, 30GB for £20 per month and 60GB for £30 has and they have also expanded the Sky VIP offering to mobile plans. They have also expanded the &quot;piggybank&quot; facility to allow customers to &quot;cash-in&quot; piggybank data to bring the monthly cost of a phone down.

Sky Mobile launched in Ireland in September 2024, and also announced their plans to expand to Italy.

As of 30 March 2017, Sky Mobile is offering handset deals. Products are available from manufacturers such as Samsung, Sony and Apple.

===Sky Digibox===

Sky launched with a set-top box known as the Sky Digibox, using the Slogans &quot;&quot;What do you want to watch?&quot;, &quot;Entertainment your way&quot;&quot; and the current slogan &quot;Believe in Better&quot;. This was followed by Sky+, a digital video recorder with an internal hard drive which allows viewers to &#x27;pause live television&#x27; (by switching from a live feed to a paused real-time recording that can be restarted at any point) and schedule programs to record in the future.

In later years the Sky+ box and then the Sky+ HD box replaced the original Digibox. The first photos of a prototype Sky HD box began appearing in magazines in August 2005. Sky launched HDTV services in May 2006. All Sky+ HD boxes incorporate a version of Sky+ using a 300GB, 500GB, or 1TB hard drive (of which 160GB, 250GB or 500GB are available to the user) to accommodate the necessary extra data.

===Sky+===

Sky initially charged an additional subscription fee for using a Sky+ PVR with their service; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels. This changed as of 1 July 2007, and now customers that subscribe to any Sky package have Sky+ included at no extra charge. Customers that do not subscribe to Sky&#x27;s channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky+ functions. In September 2007, Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky+ at women. As of 31 March 2008, Sky had 3,393,000 Sky+ users.

In January 2010 Sky discontinued the Sky+ Box, limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky+ HD Box as standard, thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky+. In February 2011 Sky discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box, offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky+ functionality.

===Sky+ HD===

Sky launched its HDTV service, Sky+ HD, on 22 May 2006. Prior to its launch, Sky claimed that 40,000 people had registered to receive the HD service. In the week before the launch, rumours started to surface that Sky was having supply issues with its set-top box (STB) from the manufacturer Thomson. On Thursday 18 May 2006, and continuing through the weekend before launch, people were reporting that Sky had either cancelled or rescheduled its installation. Finally, the BBC reported that 17,000 customers had yet to receive the service due to failed deliveries. On 31 March 2012, Sky announced the total number of homes with Sky+ HD was 4,222,000.

In early 2012, Sky released an update to its Sky Anytime service. This update offers customers the chance to buy and rent films from the Sky Store. In June 2012, Sky launched a new EPG for Sky+ HD boxes. The update included a new modernised look and improved functionality. As of 1 October 2012, Sky Anytime was rebranded as Sky On Demand which included ITV Player and Demand 5. BBC iPlayer followed in late autumn with 4oD which changed to All 4 on 30 March 2015, and launched in early 2013.

====Sky 3D====

Sky began to broadcast programmes in 3D in April 2010. This included new 3D channels, including a &quot;Sky Sports 3D&quot; and &quot;Sky Movies 3D&quot;. Sky previously experimented with 3D broadcasting by broadcasting an Arsenal vs Manchester Unitedfootball game live in 3D in nine pubs situated throughout the United Kingdom.

===Sky Q===

On 18 November 2015, Sky announced Sky Q, a range of products and services to be available in 2016. The Sky Q range consists of three set-top boxes (Sky Q 1TB, Sky Q 2TB and Sky Q Mini), a broadband router (Sky Q Hub) and mobile applications.

The Sky Q set-top boxes introduce a new user interface, Wi-Fi hotspot functionality, Power-line and Bluetooth connectivity and a new touch-sensitive remote control. The Sky Q Mini set-top boxes connect to the Sky Q set-top boxes with a Wi-Fi or Power-line connection rather than receive their own satellite feeds. This allows all set-top boxes in a household to share recordings and other media. Sky Q Mini boxes are not capable of UHD playback due to hardware limitations.

Sky Q became available to order on 9 February 2016.

Unlike Sky, Sky+, and Sky+ HD boxes, Sky Q boxes remain the property of Sky and must be returned when the contract ends. Charges of up to £140 per item apply for unreturned items – Sky claims this charge does not buy the equipment, which must still be given back.

====4K UHD====
The Sky Q 2TB set-top box is capable of receiving and displaying 4K UHD broadcasts. HDR was added on 27 May 2020, alongside the launch of Sky Nature and Sky Documentary channels. The HLG format is to be included in a select number of UHD VoD downloads, starting with Sky Nature before being added to other channel content. UHD broadcasts started on 13 August 2016, with the first live Premier League football match of the 2016/17 season, Hull vs Leicester City. UHD broadcasts are available free of charge to Sky Q 2TB multiscreen customers with any other relevant subscriptions.

===Sky Glass===
On 11 October 2021, Sky announced an in-house smart TV range known as Sky Glass. Features include a 4K quantum dot display, integrated Dolby Atmos surround sound speakers and voice controls. Also announced was a 4K camera with motion controls, gesture support and a TV sharing feature developed in partnership with Microsoft. The TV set is designed to stream video over an internet connection; a satellite dish is therefore not required. It also includes a backup Freeview tuner in case a broadband connection is not available. Sky Glass was released on 18 October 2021 in the UK, and 25 August 2022 in Ireland.

=== Sky Stream ===

On 27 September 2022, Sky announced a new streaming box called Sky Stream, which was released on 18 October 2022. The service is compatible with any broadband company, however the box is registered with a specific home.

==Marketing==
Sky (formerly marketed as Sky Digital) is the brand name for Sky Group&#x27;s United Kingdom digital satellite television and telecommunications services. Slogans that have been used for marketing include &quot;&quot;What do you want to watch?&quot;, &quot;Entertainment your way&quot;&quot; and the current slogan &quot;Believe in Better&quot;. Sky has also aired several advertisements featuring characters from Toy Story for &quot;Toy Story of Terror!&quot; and &quot;Toy Story That Time Forgot&quot;, &quot;Minions&quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Panda 3&quot;, &quot;The Secret Life of Pets&quot;, &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, &quot;Despicable Me 3&quot; and &quot;Monster Family&quot;.

==Broadcasting==

===Transmission===
When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.2°E orbital position, unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E. This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat&#x27;s Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 33C) at 28.5°E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels. The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom.

New Astra satellites joined the position in 2000 and 2001, and the number of channels available to customers increased accordingly. This trend continued with the launch of Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 33C) in 2001. Additionally, some channels occasionally received new numbering – However, in early 2006, the majority of channels received new numbering, with some receiving single-digit changes, whilst others received new numbers entirely.

It was the UK&#x27;s most popular digital TV service until it was overtaken by Freeview in April 2007.

Prior to the migration to Astra 2E, 2F and 2G, Sky was transmitted from the Astra satellites located at 28.2° east (2A/2C/2E/2F) and Eutelsat&#x27;s Eutelsat 33C satellite at 28.5°E.

As of 2019, Astra 2E, 2F and 2G are the sole satellites used by Sky UK; a number of services are served via narrow UK-only spot beams, the other services downlinked with a Europe-wide footprint. UK-only spot beams are intentionally tightly focused over mainland UK, however they are still receivable dependent on location and access to a sufficiently large dish and sensitive LNB.

Eutelsat 33C was subsequently moved to 33° East, then moved again to 133° West and renamed as &#x27;Eutelsat 133 West A&#x27; to serve transponders offering European and African language services.

===Low-noise block converter===
Provided is a universal Ku band LNB (9.75/10.600 GHz) which is fitted at the end of the dish and pointed at the correct satellite constellation; most digital receivers will receive the free to air channels. Some broadcasts are free-to-air and unencrypted, some are encrypted but do not require a monthly subscription (known as free-to-view), some are encrypted and require a monthly subscription, and some are pay-per-view services. To view the encrypted content a VideoGuard UK-equipped receiver (all of which are dedicated to the Sky service, and cannot be used to decrypt other services) needs to be used. Unofficial CAMs are now available to view the service, although the use of
them breaks the user&#x27;s contract with Sky and invalidates the user&#x27;s rights to use the card.

===Standard definition broadcasts===
Sky&#x27;s standard definition broadcasts are in DVB-compliant MPEG-2, with the Sky Cinema and Sky Box Office channels including optional Dolby Digital soundtracks for recent films, although these are only accessible with a Sky+ box. Sky+ HD material is broadcast using MPEG-4 and most of the HD material uses the DVB-S2 standard. Interactive services and 7-day EPG use the proprietary OpenTV system, with set-top boxes including modems for a return path. Sky News, amongst other channels, provides a pseudo-video on demand interactive service by broadcasting looping video streams.

===Digital satellite receivers===
Sky utilises the VideoGuard pay-TV scrambling system owned by NDS, a Cisco Systems company. There are tight controls over the use of VideoGuard decoders; they are not available as stand-alone DVB CAMs (conditional-access modules). Sky has design authority over all digital satellite receivers capable of receiving their service. The receivers, though designed and built by different manufacturers, must conform to the same user interface look and feel as all the others. This extends to the Personal video recorder (PVR) offering (branded Sky+).

===Electronic programme guide===

====Technology====
Sky maintains an electronic programme guide (EPG) which provides information about upcoming programmes and a list of channels. TV channels available on Sky are assigned a three-digit logical channel number which can be entered on the remote control to access the channel and determines in what order the channels are listed. Since 2005, radio channels similarly receive a four-digit EPG number (usually 0 prefix + three digits, although they can sometimes have a 3 prefix instead of a 0 on some older Sky Digiboxes &amp; Sky+ boxes).

The EPG differs depending on the viewer&#x27;s location due to the limited regional availability of certain channels or conditions relating to their must-carry status. For example, this ensures that viewers get access to the correct BBC or ITV region or that S4C gets a prominent listing in Wales.

All channels are grouped into categories depending on their content. What section of the EPG a channel gets allocated is determined by rules set up by Sky.

In 2000, Sky introduced an audio channel line-up service for its blind or partially-sighted customers on channel 996, which features a continuous recording of a voice reading out the names and numbers of all the channels that are currently available. The service started with a female voice, who has since been replaced by several male voices in later years (including today&#x27;s male voice) - as by far she was the only female voice to be used on the service.

Sky has no veto over the presence of channels on their EPG, with open access being enforced as part of their operating licence from Ofcom. Any channel which can get carriage on a suitable beam of a satellite at 28° East is entitled to access to Sky&#x27;s EPG for a fee, ranging from £15–100,000. Third-party channels which opt for encryption receive discounts ranging from reduced price to free EPG entries, free carriage on a Sky leased transponder or actual payment for being carried. However, even in this case, Sky does not carry any control over the channel&#x27;s content or carriage issues such as picture quality.

In October 2007, Sky announced that they would not accept new applications to launch the channel on their EPG, citing &quot;very significant memory constraints&quot; on many of its older digiboxes.

In June 2012, Sky launched a new EPG dubbed &quot;Darwin&quot; for their Sky+HD receivers, offering a more modern, refreshed interface and some improved functionality. Newer SkyQ UHD receivers utilise different hardware, so run a different software stack.

====Numbering system====
The EPG numbering is altered frequently when new channels launch or receive new numbers. A few times, the EPG has been substantially altered. For example:
*In early 2006, most channels received new numbering. This shake-up was intended to split up the original ten categories into sixteen. For example, several channels that had been listed under the &#x27;Entertainment&#x27; category were split off into a new &#x27;Lifestyle &amp; Culture&#x27; category while the &#x27;News &amp; Documentaries&#x27; category was split into two. The &#x27;Specialist&#x27; category, which had included shopping, dating, gambling, and international and adult channels was split into several genres.
*Following the integration of Living TV Group into Sky in early 2011, several prominent slots were freed up as many channels were closed down. It was, reported Broadband TV News, the biggest reshuffle in EPG positions for over a decade, with MTV, Comedy Central, Universal Channel, Syfy, News Corporation&#x27;s FX, and 40 HD channels moving to more prominent places.
* Documentaries and other channels moving towards general entertainment programming and many other channel categories are being overspilled into other parts of the EPG. Sky reshuffled the channels again on 1 May 2018 which merged the documentaries and entertainment channels making many documentaries move to more prominent slots which had been occupied by time shift and standard definition channels which had been given their own areas in the 200s and 800s with the 800s being also filled with SD channels from other categories.

==Competition==
On 12 July 2011, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown claimed that Sky&#x27;s largest shareholder – News Corporation – attempted to affect government policy with regards to the BBC in pursuit of its own commercial interests. He went further, in a speech in Parliament on 13 July 2011, stating:

&quot;Mr James Murdoch, which included his cold assertion that profit, not standards were what mattered in the media, underpinned an ever more aggressive News International and Sky agenda under his and Mrs Brooks&#x27; leadership that was brutal in its simplicity. Their aim was to cut the BBC licence fee, to force BBC online to charge for its content, for the BBC to sell off its commercial activities, to open up more national sporting events to bids from Sky and move them away from the BBC, to open up the cable and satellite infrastructure market, and to reduce the power of their regulator, Ofcom. I rejected those policies.&quot;

On 13 July 2011, MP Chris Bryant stated to the House of Commons, in the Parliamentary Debate on the Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation Bid for Sky that the company was anti-competitive:

&quot;The company has lots of technological innovation that only a robust entrepreneur could bring to British society, but it has also often been profoundly anti-competitive. I believe that the bundling of channels so as to increase profit and make it impossible for others to participate in the market is anti-competitive. I believe that the way in which the application programming interface—the operating system—has been used has been anti-competitive and that Sky has deliberately set about selling set-top boxes elsewhere, outside areas where they have proper rights. If one visits a flat in Spain where a British person lives, one finds that they mysteriously manage to have a Sky box there even though it is registered to a house in the United Kingdom.&quot; 

==Virgin Media dispute==
Virgin Media (re-branded in 2007 from &quot;NTL:Telewest&quot;) started to offer a high-definition television (HDTV) capable set top box, although from 30 November 2006 until 30 July 2009 it only carried one linear HD channel, BBC HD, after the conclusion of the ITV HD trial. Virgin Media has claimed that other HD channels were &quot;locked up&quot; or otherwise withheld from their platform, although Virgin Media did in fact have an option to carry Channel 4 HD in the future. Nonetheless, the linear channels were not offered, Virgin Media instead concentrating on its Video on Demand service to carry a modest selection of HD content. Virgin Media has nevertheless made a number of statements over the years, suggesting that more linear HD channels are on the way.

In 2007, Sky and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV. The failure to renew the existing carriage agreements negotiated with NTL and Telewest resulted in Virgin Media removing the basic channels from the network on 1 March 2007. Virgin Media claimed that Sky had substantially increased the asking price for the channels, a claim which Sky denied, on the basis that their new deal offered &quot;substantially more value&quot; by including HD channels and Video On Demand content which was not previously carried by cable.

In response, Sky ran a number of TV, radio and print advertisements claiming that Virgin Media &quot;doubted the value&quot; of the channels concerned, at first urging Virgin Media customers to call their cable operator to show their support for Sky, and later urging Virgin Media customers to migrate to Sky to continue receiving the channels. The broadcasting regulator Ofcom subsequently found these adverts in breach of their code.

The availability (at an extra charge) of Sky&#x27;s premium sports and movie services was not affected by the dispute, and Sky Sports 3 was offered as a replacement for Sky One on many Virgin Media packages. This impasse continued for twenty-one months, with both companies initiating High Court proceedings. Amongst Virgin Media&#x27;s claims to the court (denied by Sky) were that Sky had unfairly reduced the amount which it paid to VMTV for the carriage of Virgin Media&#x27;s own channels on satellite.

Eventually, on 4 November 2008 it was announced that an agreement had been struck for Sky&#x27;s basic channels – including Sky One, Sky Two, Sky Three, Sky News, Sky Sports News, Sky Arts 1, Sky Arts 2, Sky Real Lives and Sky Real Lives 2 to return to Virgin Media from 13 November 2008 until 12 June 2011. In exchange, Sky would be provided continued carriage of Virgin Media Television&#x27;s channels – Living, Livingit, Bravo, Bravo +1, Trouble, Challenge and Virgin1 for the same period.

The agreements include fixed annual carriage fees of £30m for the channels with both channel suppliers able to secure additional capped payments if their channels meet certain performance-related targets. Currently, there is no indication as to whether the new deal includes the additional Video On Demand and High Definition content which had previously been offered by Sky. As part of the agreements, both Sky and Virgin Media agreed to terminate all High Court proceedings against each other relating to the carriage of their respective basic channels.

== Discovery Networks dispute ==
On 25 January 2017, Discovery Networks announced that they were in a dispute with Sky UK over the costs of payment fees to the broadcaster.

The broadcaster threatened to blackout their channels on the Sky platform, which includes Eurosport, Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, DMAX, Discovery Turbo, Discovery Shed, Discovery Science, Discovery History and Home &amp; Health, unless Sky accepted their request for fair pricing. Sky indicated that they will not bow down, and the channels would likely become unavailable from 1 February 2017.

The same day, Discovery sent out a press release on the dispute and also blocked access to its own website with the news. Discovery stated &quot;enough is enough&quot; and claimed that Sky is paying less for its channels than it was ten years ago. At that time, Discovery had stated that its viewing share has grown by more than 20%. Managing Director Susanna Dinnage stated in the press release:&quot;We believe Sky is using what we consider to be its dominant market position to further its own commercial interest over those of viewers and independent broadcasters. The vitality of independent broadcasters like Discovery and plurality in TV is under threat.&quot;

In response, Sky stated that they had been &quot;overpaying Discovery for years.&quot; It comes after Sky had paid £4.2 billion on Premier League rights for the following three seasons.

The channel &#x27;blackout&#x27; would have also affected the Sky-owned NOW TV with the removal of Discovery Channel from both the live stream and On Demand service.

On 31 January 2017 at around 21:00, Sky UK revealed that they would continue to broadcast the Discovery Networks Channels by releasing the following statement:
&quot;Great news, we can confirm that Sky will continue to carry the Discovery and Eurosport channels. This means you can still watch channels including: Animal Planet, Discovery HD, Discovery History, Discovery Home &amp; Health, Discovery Science, Discovery Shed, Discovery Turbo, DMAX, Eurosport1, Eurosport2, Investigation Discovery, TLC, and Quest.&quot;
At the time of the statement release, it had not been revealed how much Sky UK had paid Discovery Networks.

==Litigation==
In July 2013, the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft&#x27;s use of the term &quot;SkyDrive&quot; infringed on Sky&#x27;s right to the &quot;Sky&quot; trademark. On 31 July 2013, Sky and Microsoft announced their settlement, in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling, and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified &quot;reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand,&quot; plus &quot;financial and other terms, the details of which are confidential&quot;. On 27 January 2014, Microsoft announced &quot;that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive&quot; and &quot;SkyDrive Pro&quot; becomes &quot;OneDrive for Business&quot;.

Hello Games was in legal negotiations with Sky over the trademark on the word &quot;Sky&quot; used for the title of their video game &quot;No Man&#x27;s Sky&quot; for three years. The issue was ultimately settled in June 2016, allowing Hello Games to continue to use the name.

<text>The Brahmanas (; Sanskrit: , IAST: &quot;Brāhmaṇam&quot;) are Vedic śruti works attached to the Samhitas (hymns and mantras) of the Rig, Sama, Yajur, and Atharva Vedas. They are a secondary layer or classification of Sanskrit texts embedded within each Veda, which explain and instruct on the performance of Vedic rituals (in which the related Samhitas are recited). In addition to explaining the symbolism and meaning of the Samhitas, Brahmana literature also expounds scientific knowledge of the Vedic Period, including observational astronomy and, particularly in relation to altar construction, geometry. Divergent in nature, some Brahmanas also contain mystical and philosophical material that constitutes Aranyakas and Upanishads.

Each Veda has one or more of its own Brahmanas, and each Brahmana is generally associated with a particular Shakha or Vedic school. Less than twenty Brahmanas are currently extant, as most have been lost or destroyed. Dating of the final codification of the &quot;Brahmanas&quot; and associated Vedic texts is controversial, as they were likely recorded after several centuries of oral transmission. The oldest Brahmana is dated to about 900 BCE, while the most recent are dated to around 700 BCE.

== Nomenclature and etymology ==
&quot;Brahmana&quot; (or &quot;Brāhmaṇam&quot;, Sanskrit: ब्राह्मणम्) can be loosely translated as &#x27;explanations of sacred knowledge or doctrine&#x27; or &#x27;Brahmanical explanation&#x27;. According to the Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary, &#x27;Brahmana&#x27; means:

* &#x27;Explanations of sacred knowledge or doctrine [especially] for the use of the Brāhmans in their sacrifices&#x27;.
* &#x27;The Brāhmaṇa portion of the Veda (as distinct from its Mantra and Upanishad portion) and consisting of a class of works called Brāhmaṇas (they contain rules for the employment of the Mantras or hymns at various sacrifices, with detailed explanations of their origin and meaning and numerous old legends)&#x27;.
* According to &#x27;Sāyaṇa to contain two parts: 1. &quot;vidhi&quot;, rules or directions for [sacrificial] rites [and] 2. &quot;artha-vāda&quot;, explanatory remarks&#x27;.

=== Etymology ===
M. Haug states that etymologically, &#x27;the word [&#x27;Brahmana&#x27; or &#x27;Brahmanam&#x27;] is derived from brahman which properly signifies the Brahma priest who must know all Vedas, and understand the whole course and meaning of the sacrifice... the dictum of such a Brahma priest who passed as a great authority, was called a Brahmanam&#x27;.

=== Synonyms ===
S. Shrava states that synonyms of the word &#x27;Brahmana&#x27; include:

* Vyakhyana: In Brahmana works such as the Shatapatha Brahmana (6.7.4.6), &#x27;the word &quot;vyakhyana&quot; also is a synonym of the commonly used word brahmana&#x27;. Definitions of &#x27;Vyakhyana&#x27; (व्याख्यान) include &#x27;explaining&#x27;, &#x27;exposition&#x27;, &#x27;elucidation&#x27;, &#x27;expounding&#x27;, &#x27;interpretation&#x27;, and &#x27;lecture&#x27;. 
* Pravachana&#x27;: Another &#x27;synonym of the brahmana word is &quot;pravachana&quot;&#x27;. Definitions of &#x27;Pravachana&#x27; (प्रवचन) include &#x27;expounding&#x27;, &#x27;teaching&#x27;, &#x27;exposition&#x27;, and &#x27;oral instruction&#x27;.
* Vijnayate: Is &#x27;used to denote a reference from a brahmana work. The word has first of all been used in the Gopatha Brahmana&#x27;. Definitions of &#x27;Vijnayate&#x27; include &#x27;It is a fact that...&#x27; and &#x27;be distinguished or discerned&#x27;.

== Overview ==

R. Dalal states that the &#x27;Brahmanas are texts attached to the Samhitas [hymns] – Rig, Sama, Yajur and Atharva Vedas – and provide explanations of these and guidance for the priests in sacrificial rituals&#x27;. S. Shri elaborates, stating &#x27;Brahmanas explain the hymns of the Samhitas and are in both prose and verse form... The Brahmanas are divided into Vidhi and Arthavada. Vidhi are commands in the performance of Vedic sacrifices, and Arthavada praises the rituals, the glory of the Devas and so on. The belief in reincarnation and transmigration of soul started with [the] Brahmanas... [The] Brahmana period ends around 500 BC[E] with the emergence of Buddhism and it overlaps the period of Aranyakas, Sutras, Smritis and the first Upanishads&#x27;.

M. Haug states that the &#x27;Veda, or scripture of the Brahmans, consists, according to the opinion of the most eminent divines of Hindustan, of two principal parts, viz. Mantra [Samhita] and Brahmanam... Each of the four Vedas (Rik, Yajus, Saman, and Atharvan) has a Mantra, as well as a Brahmana portion. The difference between both may be briefly stated as follows: That part which contains the sacred prayers, the invocations of the different deities, the sacred verses for chanting at the sacrifices, the sacrificial formulas [is] called &quot;Mantra&quot;... The Brahmanam [part] always presupposes the Mantra; for without the latter it would have no meaning... [they contain] speculations on the meaning of the mantras, gives precepts for their application, relates stories of their origin... and explains the secret meaning of the latter&#x27;.

J. Eggeling states that &#x27;While the Brâhma&quot;n&quot;as are thus our oldest sources from which a comprehensive view of the sacrificial ceremonial can be obtained, they also throw a great deal of light on the earliest metaphysical and linguistic speculations of the Hindus. Another, even more interesting feature of these works, consists in the numerous legends scattered through them. From the archaic style in which these mythological tales are generally composed, as well as from the fact that not a few of them are found in Brâhma&quot;n&quot;as of different schools and Vedas, though often with considerable variations, it is pretty evident that the ground-work of many of them goes back to times preceding the composition of the Brâhma&quot;n&quot;as&#x27;.

The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) states that while &#x27;the Upanishads speculate on the nature of the universe, and the relationship of the one and the many, the immanent and transcendental, the Brahmanas make concrete the world-view and the concepts through a highly developed system of ritual-yajna. This functions as a strategy for a continuous reminder of the inter-relatedness of man and nature, the five elements and the sources of energy&#x27;.

=== Performance of rituals ===
The Brahmanas are particularly noted for their instructions on the proper performance of rituals, as well as explanations on the symbolic importance of sacred words and ritual actions. Academics such as P. Alper, K. Klostermaier and F.M, Muller state that these instructions insist on exact pronunciation (accent), &quot;chhandas&quot; (छन्दः, meters), precise pitch, with coordinated movement of hand and fingers – that is, perfect delivery. Klostermaier adds that the Satapatha Brahamana, for example, states that verbal perfection made a mantra infallible, while one mistake made it powerless. Scholars suggest that this orthological perfection preserved Vedas in an age when writing technology was not in vogue, and the voluminous collection of Vedic knowledge were taught to and memorized by dedicated students through Svādhyāya, then remembered and verbally transmitted from one generation to the next. It seems breaking silence too early in at least one ritual is permissible in the Satapatha (1.1.4.9), where &#x27;in that case mutter some Rik [Rigveda] or Yagus-text [Yajurveda] addressed to Vishnu; for Vishnu is the sacrifice, so that he thereby regains obtains a hold on the sacrifice, and penance is there by done by him&#x27;.

=== The Nirukta ===
Recorded by the grammarian Yaska, the Nirukta, one of the six Vedangas or &#x27;limbs of the Vedas&#x27; concerned with correct etymology and interpretation of the Vedas, references several Brahmanas to do so. These are (grouped by Veda):
=== Commentaries of Sayana ===
The 14th Century Sanskrit scholar Sayana composed numerous commentaries on Vedic literature, including the Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads. B.R. Modak states that &#x27;king Bukka [1356–1377 CE] requested his preceptor and minister Madhavacharya to write a commentary on the Vedas, so that even common people would be able to understand the meaning of the Vedic Mantras. Madhavacharya told him that his younger brother Sayana was a learned person and hence he should be entrusted with the task&#x27;. Modak also lists the Brahmanas commented upon by Sayana (with the exception of the Gopatha):
=== Abbreviations and schools ===
For ease of reference, academics often use common abbreviations to refer to particular Brahmanas and other Vedic, post-Vedic (e.g. Puranas), and Sanskrit literature. Additionally, particular Brahmanas linked to particular Vedas are also linked to (i.e. recorded by) particular Shakhas or schools of those Vedas as well. Based on the abbreviations and Shakhas provided by works cited in this article (and other texts by Bloomfield, Keith, W. D, Whitney, and H.W. Tull), extant Brahmanas have been listed below, grouped by Veda and Shakha. Note that:

* &quot;--&quot; indicates the abbreviation or school has not been provided or found 
* There are variations of how the translated names of Vedas, Shakhas, and Brahmanas are spelt 
*Lost or fragmentary Brahmanas (e.g. the Kathaka Brahmana, KathB) have not been listed (see the section of Lost Brahmanas, below)

=== Recensions by Disciples of Vyasa ===
S. Sharva states that in &#x27;the brahmana literature this word [&#x27;brahmana&#x27;] has been commonly used as detailing the ritualism related to the different sacrifices or yajnas... The known recensions [i.e. schools or Shakhas] of the Vedas, all had separate brahmanas. Most of these brahmanas are not extant... Panini] differentiates between the old and the new brahmanas... [he asked] Was it when Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa had propounded the Vedic recensions? The brahmanas which had been propounded prior to the exposition of recensions by [Vyasa] were called as old brahmanas and those which had been expounded by his disciples were known as new brahmanas&#x27;.

== Rigveda ==
The Aitareya, Kausitaki, and Samkhyana Brahmanas are the two (or three) known extant Brahmanas of the Rigveda. A.B. Keith, a translator of the Aitareya and Kausitaki Brahmanas, states that it is &#x27;almost certainly the case that these two [Kausitaki and Samkhyana] Brahmanas represent for us the development of a single tradition, and that there must have been a time when there existed a single... text [from which they were developed and diverged]&#x27;. Although S. Shrava considers the Kausitaki and Samkhyana Brahmanas to be separate although very similar works, M. Haug considers them to be the same work referred to by different names.

=== Aitareya Brahmana ===


As detailed in the main article, the Aitareya Brahmana (AB) is ascribed to the sage Mahidasa Aitareya of the Shakala Shakha (Shakala school) of the Rigveda, and is estimated to have been recorded around 600-400 BCE. It is also linked with the Ashvalayana Shakha. The text itself consists of eight &quot;pañcikā&quot;s (books), each containing five &quot;adhyaya&quot;s (chapters), totaling forty in all. C. Majumdar states that &#x27;it deals principally with the great Soma sacrifices and the different ceremonies of royal inauguration&#x27;.

Haug states that the legend about this Brahmana, as told by Sayana, is that the &#x27;name &quot;Aitareya&quot; is by Indian tradition traced to &quot;Itara&quot;... An ancient Risi had among his many wives one who was called &quot;Itara&quot;. She had a son &quot;Mahidasa&quot; by name [i.e. Mahidasa Aitareya]... The Risi preferred the sons of his other wives to Mahidasa, and went even so far as to insult him once by placing all his other children in his lap to his exclusion. His mother, grieved at this ill-treatment of her son, prayed to her family deity (&quot;Kuladevata&quot;), [and] the Earth (Bhumi), who appeared in her celestial form in the midst of the assembly, placed him on a throne (&quot;simhasana&quot;), and gave him as a token of honour for his surpassing all other children in learning a boon (vara) which had the appearance of a Brahmana [i.e. the Aitareya]&#x27;. P. Deussen agrees, relating the same story. Notably, The story itself is remarkably similar to the legend of a Vaishnava boy called Dhruva in the Puranas (e.g. Bhagavata Purana, Canto 4, Chapter 8-12).

=== Kausitaki / Samkhyana Brahmana ===

The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) states that the &#x27;Kaushitaki Brahmana [is] associated with Baskala Shakha of [the] Rigveda and [is] also called Sankhyayana Brahmana. It is divided into thirty chapters [adhyayas] and 226 Khanda[s]. The first six chapters dealing with food sacrifice and the remaining to Soma sacrifice. This work is ascribed to Sankhyayana or Kaushitaki&#x27;. S. Shrava disagrees, stating that it &#x27;was once considered that [the] Kaushitaki or Samkhayana was the name of the same brahmana... [but the Samkhayana] differs, though slightly, from the Kaushitaki Brahmana&#x27;. C. Majumdar states that it &#x27;deals not only with the Soma, but also other sacrifices&#x27;.

Keith estimates that the Kaushîtaki-brâhmana was recorded around 600–400 BCE, adding that it is more &#x27;scientific&#x27; and &#x27;logical&#x27; than the Aitareya Brahmana, although much &#x27;of the material of the Kausitaki, and especially the legends, has been taken over by the Brahmana from a source common to it and the Aitareya, but the whole has been worked up into a harmonious unity which presents no such irregularities as are found in the Aitareya. It is clearly a redaction of the tradition of the school made deliberately after the redaction of the Aitareya&#x27;.

==== Kaushitaki Brahmana Upanishad ====
Max Müller states that the Kaushitaki Upanishad – also called the &quot;Kaushitaki Brahmana Upanishad&quot; (KBU) – &#x27;does not form part of the Kaushîtaki-brâhmana in 30 adhyâyas which we possess, and we must therefore account for its name by admitting that the Âranyaka, of which it formed a portion, could be reckoned as part of the Brâhmana literature of the Rig-veda (see Aitareya-âranyaka, Introduction, p. xcii), and that hence the Upanishad might be called the Upanishad of the Brâhmana of the Kaushîtakins&#x27;.

== Samaveda ==
W. Caland states that of the Samaveda, three Shakhas (schools or branches) &#x27;are to be distinguished; that of the Kauthumas, that of the Ranayaniyas, and that of the Jaiminiyas&#x27;.

=== Panchavimsha / Tandya Brahmana ===


Caland states that the Panchavimsha / Tandya Brahmana of the Kauthuma Shakha consists of 25 prapathakas (books or chapters). C. Majumdar states that it &#x27;is one of the oldest and most important of Brahmanas. It contains many old legends, and includes the &quot;Vratyastoma&quot;, a ceremony by which people of non-Aryan stock could be admitted into the Aryan family&#x27;.

==== Sadvimsa Brahmana ====

The Sadvimsa Brahmana is also of the Kauthuma Shakha, and consists of 5 adhyayas (lessons or chapters). Caland states it is &#x27;a kind of appendix to the [Panchavimsha Brahmana], reckoned as its 26th book [or chapter]... The text clearly intends to supplement the Pancavimsabrahmana, hence its desultory character. It treats of the Subrahmanya formula, of the one-day-rites that are destined to injure (&quot;abhicara&quot;) and other matters. This brahmana, at least partly, is presupposed by the Arseyakalpa and the Sutrakaras&#x27;.

===== Adbhuta Brahmana =====
Caland states that the Adbhuta Brahmana, also of the Kauthuma Shakha, is the &#x27;latest part [i.e. 5th adhyaya of the Sadvimsa Brahmana], that which treats of Omina and Portenta [Omens and Divination]&#x27;. Majumdar agrees.

=== Samavidhana Brahmana ===
Caland states that the Samavidhana Brahmana of the Kauthuma Shakha is &#x27;in 3 prapathakas [books or chapters]... its aim is to explain how by chanting various samans [hymns of the Samaveda] some end may be attained. It is probably older than one of the oldest dharmasastras, that of Gautama&#x27;. M. S. Bhat states that it is not properly a Brāhmaṇa text, but belongs to the Vidhāna literature.

=== Daivata Brahmana ===

Caland states that the Daivata Brahmana of the Kauthuma Shakha is &#x27;in 3 prapathakas [books or chapters]... It deals with the deities to which the samans are addressed&#x27;. Dalal adds that the &#x27;first part of the Devatadhyaya is the most important as it provides rules to determine the deities to whom the samans are dedicated. Another section ascribes colours to different verses, probably as aids to memory or for meditation... [It] includes some very late passages such as references to the four yugas or ages&#x27;.

=== Samhitopanishad Brahmana ===
Caland states that the Samhitopanishad Brahmana of the Kauthuma Shakha is &#x27;in 5 khandas [books]... It treats of the effects of recitation, the relation of the saman [hymns of the Samaveda] and the words on which it is chanted, the &quot;daksinas&quot; to be given to the religious teacher&#x27;. Dalal agrees, stating that it &#x27;describes the nature of the chants and their effects, and how the riks or Rig Vedic verses were converted into samans. Thus it reveals some of the hidden aspects of the Sama Veda&#x27;.

=== Arsheya Brahmana ===
Caland states that the Arsheya Brahmana of the Kauthuma Shakha is &quot;in 3 prapathakas [books or chapters]... This quasi-brahmana is, on the whole, nothing more than an anukramanika, a mere list of the names of the samans [hymns of the Samaveda] occurring in the first two ganas [of the Kauthumas, i.e. the Gramegeya-gana / Veya-gana and the Aramyegeya-gana / Aranya-gana]&#x27;. The nature of the ganas noted are discussed in the same text. As illustrated below, this Brahmana is virtually identical to the Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana of the Jaiminiya Shakha.

=== Vamsha Brahmana ===
Caland states that the Vamsha Brahmana of the Kauthuma Shakha is &#x27;in 3 khandas [books]... it contains the lists of teachers of the Samaveda&#x27;. Notably, Dalal adds that of the 53 teachers listed, the &#x27;earliest teacher, Kashyapa, is said to have received the teaching from the god, Agni&#x27;.

=== Jaiminiya Brahmana ===

It seems that this Brahmana has not been fully translated to date, or at least a full translation has not been made available.

S. Shrava states that the Jaiminiya Brahmana of the Jaiminiya Shakha, also called the T&quot;alavakara Brahmana&quot;, &#x27;is divided into 1348 khandas [verses]... Many of the sentences of this brahmana are similar to those found in Tamdya, Sadavimsam, Satapatha [Brahmanas] and [the] Taittirya Samhita [Krishna/Black Yajurveda]. Many of the hymns are found for the first time in it. Their composition is different from that available in Vedic literature. Most of the subjects described in it are completely new and are not found in other bramanas like Tamdya, etc... In the beginning khandas, details of daily oblation to the sacrificial fire are described... This brahmana was compiled by Jaimini a famous preceptor of Samaveda and the worthy disciple of Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa and his disciple Talavakara&#x27;.

==== Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana ====
Dalal states that the Jaiminiya Arsheya Brahmana of the Jaiminiya Shakha &#x27;is similar to the Arsheya Brahmana of the Kauthuma school but for the fact that the names of the rishis in the two are different. Unlike the Kauthuma texts, this lists only one rishi per saman&#x27;.

==== Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana ====
As detailed in the main article, also called the &quot;Talavakara Upanishad Brahmana&quot; and &quot;Jaiminiyopanishad Brahmana&quot;, it is considered an Aranyaka – not a Brahmana – and forms part of the Kena Upanishad.

=== Chandogya Brahmana ===

The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) states that the Chandogya Brahmana, also called the &quot;chanddogyopanishad Brahmana,&quot; &#x27;is divided into ten prapathakas (chapters). Its first two prapathakas (chapters) form the Mantra Brahmana (MB) and each of them is divided into eight khandas (sections). Prapathakas 3–10 form the Chandogya Upanishad&#x27;. K.G. Witz states it is of the Kauthuma Shakha (see below).

==== Mantra Brahmana ====
K. G. Witz states that the Mantra Brahmana is &#x27;a text in two chapters which mostly give Vedic Mantras which should be used in rites such as for birth and marriage. The combined text [with 8 chapters forming the Chandogya Upanishad] is [also] called [the] Upanishad Brahmana and is one of the eight canonical Brahmanas of the Kauthumas. The fact that the Upanishad was combined with the Mantra Brahmana into a single text is significant. Just as everyone in society is blessed and made part of the overall divine societal, social and world order by the household rites in the Mantra Brahmana, so everyone can direct his life toward the Infinite Reality by the numerous upasanas and vidyas of the Chandogya Upanishad.&#x27;

R. Mitra is quoted as stating that of &#x27;the two portions differ greatly, and judged by them they appear to be productions of very different ages, though both are evidently relics of pretty remote antiquity. Of the two chapters of the Khandogya-Brahmana [Chandogya Brahmana, forming the Mantra Brahmana], the first includes eight suktas [hymns] on the ceremony of marriage and the rites necessary to be observed at the birth of a child. The first Sukta is intended to be recited when offering an oblation to Agni on the occasion of a marriage, and its object is to pray for prosperity [on] behalf of the married couple. The second prays for a long life, kind relatives, and a numerous progeny [i.e. children]. The third is the marriage pledge by which the [couple] bind themselves to each other. Its spirit may be guessed from a single verse. In talking of the unanimity with which they will dwell, the bridegroom addresses his bride, &quot;That heart of thine shall be mine, and this heart of mine shall be thine&quot; [as quoted above]&#x27;.

== Yajurveda ==

=== Śukla (White) Yajurveda: Shatapatha Brahmana ===
The &#x27;final form&#x27; of the Satapatha Brahmana is estimated to have been recorded around 1000–800 BCE, although it refers to astronomical phenomena dated to 2100 BCE, and, as quoted above, historical events such as the drying up of the Sarasvati river, which is believed to have occurred around 1900 BCE. It provides scientific knowledge of geometry and observational astronomy from the Vedic period, and is considered significant in the development of Vaishnavism as the possible origin of several Puranic legends and avatars of the RigVedic god Vishnu, all of which (Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, and Vamana) are listed in the Dashavatara.

M. Winternitz states that this Brahmana is &#x27;the best known, the most extensive, and doubtless, also on account of its contents, the most important of all the Brahmanas&#x27;. Eggeling states that &#x27;The Brâhma&quot;n&quot;a of the Vâ&quot;g&quot;asaneyins bears the name of &quot;S&quot;atapatha, that is, the Brâhma&quot;n&quot;a &#x27;of a hundred paths,&#x27; because it consists of a hundred lectures (adhyâyas). Both the Vâ&quot;g&quot;asaneyi-sa&quot;m&quot;hitâ [Yajurveda] and the &quot;S&quot;atapatha-brâhma&quot;n&quot;a have come down to us in two different recensions, those of the Mâdhyandina and the Kâ&quot;n&quot;va schools&#x27;:

* Mâdhyandina recension: Ascribed to Yājñavalkya Vājasaneya, it consists of 14 khandas (&#x27;books&#x27;) which can be divided into two major parts. The first nine khandas are commentaries of the corresponding samhita of the Śukla (white) Yajurveda. The final five khandas cover supplementary and ritualistically newer material; and the final book constitutes the Bṛhad-Āraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
* Kanva recension: Ascribed to Samkara, it consists of 17 khandas. The IGNCA adds that &#x27;the division of Kandika [verses] is more rational in the Kanva text than in the other... The name &#x27;Satapatha&#x27;, as Eggeling has suggested, might have been based on the number of Adhyayas [chapters] in the Madhyandina which is exactly one hundred. But the Kanva recension, which has one hundred and four Adhyayas is also known by the same name. In Indian tradition words like &#x27;sata&#x27; and &#x27;sahasra&#x27;, indicating numbers, do not always stand for exact numbers&#x27;.

=== Krishna (Black) Yajurveda: Taittiriya Brahmana ===

Ascribed to the sage Tittiri (or Taittiri), the Taittiriya Brahmana of the Taittiriya Shakha consists of three &quot;Ashtakas&quot; (books or parts) of commentaries on the performance of Vedic sacrificial rituals, astronomy, and information about the gods. It is stated by the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) to be &#x27;mixed of mantras and Brahmans... composed in poetic and prose manner&#x27;.

M. Winternitz adds that the &quot;Taittiriya-Brahmana of the Black Yajurveda is nothing but a continuation of the Taittiriya-Samhita, for the Brahmanas were already included in the Samhitas of the Black Yajurveda. The Taittiriya-Brahmana, therefore, contains only later additions to the Samhita.&quot;

According to the Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, Taittiri was a disciple of Yaska (300–400 BCE), although according to the Vishnu Purana (Book 3, Chapter 5), Taittiri and Yaska were disciples of Vaiśampáyana (500–600 BCE). According to H.H. Wilson, in the Anukramańí (index of the black Yajurveda), it &#x27;is there said that Vaiśampáyana taught it to Yaska, who taught it to Tittiri, who also became a teacher; whence the term Taittiríya, for a grammatical rule explains it to mean, &#x27;The Taittiríyas are those who read what was said or repeated by Tittiri&#x27;.&#x27;

==== Taittiriya Chardi ====
Although the Taittiriya Chardi Brahmana is mentioned (i.e. listed) by academics such as S. Shri and S.N. Nair, no further information could be found.

==== Taittiriya Pravargya ====

The Taittiriya Pravargya is a commentary on the Pravargya ritual, contained in the Taittiriya Aranyaka. This is not listed or referred to as a Brahmana in the works cited.

=== Vadhula – Anvakhyana ===
Dalal states that the Vadhula (or Anvakhyana) Brahmana of the Vadhula Shakha is &#x27;a Brahmana type of text, though it is actually part of the Vadhula Shrauta Sutra&#x27;. However, B.B. Chaubey states that about &#x27;the nature of the text there has been confusion whether &quot;VadhAnva&quot; [Vadhula Anvakhyana Brahmana] is a Brahmana, or an Anubrahmana [&#x27;work resembling a brahmana&#x27; or &#x27;according to the brahmana&#x27;], or an Anvakhyana [&#x27;explanation keeping close to the text&#x27; or &#x27;minute account or statement&#x27;]. When Caland found some newly discovered MSS [manuscript] of the Vadhula School he was not sure about the nature of the text. Because of the composite nature of the MS [manuscript] he took the text as part of the Srautasurta of the Vadhulas. However, he was not unaware of the Brahmanic character of the text... according to Caland, the word Anvakhyana was given as a specific name to the Brahmanas, or Brahmana-like passages of the Vadhulasutra&#x27;.

== Atharvaveda ==
According to M. Bloomfield, the 9 shakhas – schools or branches – of the Atharvaveda are:

* Paippalada, Paippaladaka, Paippaladi, Pippalada, or Paopalayana: A &#x27;patronymic derived from the name of a teacher Pippaladi&#x27;.
* Tauda, Taudayana, Stauda, or Staudayana: There is &#x27;nothing to the real history of the name&#x27;.
* Mauda or Maydayana
* Saunakiya, Saunaka, or Saunakin
* Jajala: &#x27;The acarya eponymous of the school seems to have been Jajali, as reported by the Mahabhasya&#x27;.
* Jalada or Jaladayana
* Brahmavada
* Devadarsa or Devadarsin
* Caranavaidya

=== Gopatha Brahmana ===


Bloomfield states that the Gopatha Brahmana &#x27;does not favour us with a report of the name of its author or authors. it is divided into two parts, the purva-brahmana in five prapathakas (chapters), and the uttara-brahmana in six prapathakas. The purva shows considerable originality, especially when it is engaged in the glorification of the Atharvan and its priests; this is indeed its main purpose. Its materials are by no means all of the usual Brahmana-character; they broach frequently upon the domain of Upanishad... The uttara has certainly some, though probably very few original sections&#x27;.

S.S. Bahulkar states that the &#x27;Gopatha Brahmana (GB.) is the only brahmana text of AV [Atharvaveda], belonging to both the recensions [Shakhas], viz. Saunaka and Paippalada&#x27;. Dalal agrees, stating the &#x27;aim of this Brahmana seems to be to incorporate the Atharva [Veda] in the Vedic ritual, and bring it in line with the other three Vedas. This Brahmana is the same for the Paippalada and Shaunaka shakhas, and is the only existing Brahmana of the Artharva Veda&#x27;. C. Majumdar states that &#x27;although classed as a Brahmana, [it] really belongs to the Vedanga literature, and is a very late work&#x27;.

== Lost Brahmanas ==
M Haug states that there &#x27;must have been, as we may learn from Panini and Patanjali&#x27;s Mahabhasya, a much larger number of Brahmanas belonging to each Veda; and even Sayana, who lived only about four [now five] hundred years ago, was acquainted with more than we have now&#x27;.

S. Shrava states that &#x27;Innumerable manuscripts of the valuable [Vedic] literature have been lost due to atrocities of the rulers and invaders, ravages of time, and utter disregard and negligence. These factors contributed to the loss of hundreds of manuscripts. Once their number was more than a few hundred. Had these been available today the ambiguity in the interpretation of Vedic hymns could not have crept in&#x27;. Based on references in other Sanskrit literature, Shrava lists many of these lost works:

=== Rigveda ===
=== Samaveda ===
=== Yajurveda ===
|Chhagaleya
|A division of the Taittiriya school. Referred to in works such as the Baudhayana Srauta Sutra.

=== Unknown ===
The Brahmanas listed below are often only mentioned by name in other texts without any further information such as what Veda they are attached to.
== Manuscripts and translations ==

=== Rigveda ===
=== Yajurveda ===
=== Atharvaveda ===
=== Lost Brahmanas (fragments) ===

<text>The Aranyakas (; ; IAST: &quot;&quot;) are a part of the ancient Indian Vedas concerned with the meaning of ritual sacrifice, composed in about 700 BC. They typically represent the later sections of the Vedas, and are one of many layers of Vedic texts. The other parts of the Vedas are the Samhitas (benedictions, hymns), Brahmanas (commentary), and the Upanishads (spirituality and abstract philosophy).

&quot;Aranyakas&quot; describe and discuss rituals from various perspectives; some include philosophical speculations. For example, the Katha Aranyaka discusses rituals connected with the &quot;Pravargya&quot;. The Aitareya Aranyaka includes explanation of the &quot;Mahavrata&quot; ritual from ritualisitic to symbolic meta-ritualistic points of view. &quot;Aranyakas&quot;, however, neither are homogeneous in content nor in structure. &quot;Aranyakas&quot; are sometimes identified as &quot;karma-kanda&quot; (कर्मकाण्ड), ritualistic action/sacrifice section, while the Upanishads are identified as &quot;jnana-kanda&quot; (ज्ञानकाण्ड) knowledge/spirituality section. In an alternate classification, the early part of Vedas are called Samhitas and the ritualistic commentary on the mantras and rituals are called the Brahmanas which together are identified as the ceremonial &quot;karma-kanda&quot;, while &quot;Aranyakas&quot; and &quot;Upanishads&quot; are referred to as the &quot;jnana-kanda&quot;.

In the immense volume of ancient Indian Vedic literature, there is no absolute universally true distinction between &quot;Aranyakas&quot; and &quot;Brahmanas&quot;. Similarly, there is no absolute distinction between &quot;Aranyakas&quot; and &quot;Upanishads&quot;, as some Upanishads are incorporated inside a few &quot;Aranyakas&quot;. &quot;Aranyakas&quot;, along with Brahmanas, represent the emerging transitions in later Vedic religious practices. The transition completes with the blossoming of ancient Indian philosophy from external sacrificial rituals to internalized philosophical treatise of Upanishads.

==Etymology==
&quot;Aranyaka&quot; () literally means &quot;produced, born, relating to a forest&quot; or rather, &quot;belonging to the wilderness&quot;. It is derived from the word &quot;&quot; (अरण्य), which means &quot;wilderness&quot;.

Several theories have been proposed on the origin of the word &quot;Aranyaka&quot;. Originally, as per Oldenberg (1915), it meant dangerous texts to be studied in the wilderness (Taitt. Ar. II). A later, post-Vedic theory holds that these texts were meant to be studied in a forest, while the other holds that the name came from these being the manuals of allegorical interpretation of sacrifices, for those in Vanaprastha (retired, forest-dwelling) stage of their life, however the Vanaprastha Ashrama came into existence only well after that of the Sanyasin (Sprockhoff 1976), according to the historic age-based Ashrama system of human life. Four Ashrams consist of Brhmacharya up to 25 years for learning and grooming for life; Gruhastha from 26 to 50 years for marriage and worldly activities; Vanaprastha from 51 to 75 when person/couple retire from active family/social life and devote time in religious, philosophical pursuit. It is so named after Vana-Forest life by moving to the forest. From 75 till end of life person lives life of an ascetic, contemplating on supernatural, pure philosophy, accepting whatever is available for sustaining the life. It is mostly in helping the society in whatever manner possible, giving benefit of long experience and knowledge accumulated during the lifetime.

Taittiriya Ar. 2 says, &quot;from where one cannot see the roofs of the settlement&quot;, which does not indicate a forested area.

== Discussion ==

===Structure===
&quot;Aranyakas&quot; are diverse in their structure. Jan Gonda summarizes:

Many &quot;Aranyaka&quot; texts enumerate mantras, identifications, etymologies, discussions, myths and symbolic interpretations, but a few such as by sage Arunaketu include hymns with deeper philosophical insights.

===Contents===
The Aranyakas discuss sacrifices, in the language and style of the Brahmanas, and thus are primarily concerned with the proper performance of ritual (orthopraxy). The Aranyakas were restricted to a particular class of rituals that nevertheless were frequently included in the Vedic curriculum.

The Aranyakas are associated with, and named for, individual Vedic shakhas.
*Rigveda
**Aitareya Aranyaka belongs to the Aitareya Shakha of Rigveda
**Kaushitaki Aranyaka belongs to the Kaushitaki and Shankhayana Shakhas of Rigveda
*Yajurveda
**Taittiriya Aranyaka belongs to the Taittiriya Shakha of the Krishna Yajurveda
**Maitrayaniya Aranyaka belongs to the Maitrayaniya Shakha of the Krishna Yajurveda
**Katha Aranyaka belongs to the (Caraka)Katha Shakha of the Krishna Yajurveda
**Brihad Aranyaka in the Madhyandina and the Kanva versions of the Shukla Yajurveda. The Madhyandina version has 9 sections, of which the last 6 are the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.
*Samaveda
**Talavakara Aranyaka or Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana belongs to the Talavakara or Jaiminiya Shakha of the Samaveda. A part of this text forms the Kena Upanishad.
**Aranyaka Samhita is not a typical Aranyaka text: rather the Purvarchika of the Samaveda Samhitas has a section of mantras, called the &#x27;Aranyaka Samhita&#x27;, on which the Aranyagana Samans are sung.
The Atharvaveda has no surviving Aranyaka, though the Gopatha Brahmana is regarded as its Aranyaka, a remnant of a larger, lost Atharva (Paippalada) Brahmana.

=== Aitareya Aranyaka ===

There are five chapters each of which is even considered as a full Aranyaka. The first one deals with the regimen known as ‘Mahaa-vrata’. The explanations are both ritualistic as well as speculative. The second one has six chapters of which the first three are about ‘Praana-vidyaa’ – meaning, Prana, the Vital Air that constitutes the life-breath of a living body is also the life-breath of all mantras, all vedas and all vedic declarations (cf. 2.2.2 of Aitareya Aranyaka). It is in this portion of the Aranyaka that one finds specific statements about how one who follows the vedic injunctions and performs the sacrifices goes to become the God of Fire, or the Sun or Air and how one who transgresses the Vedic prescriptions is born into lower levels of being, namely, as birds and reptiles.

The 4th, 5th and 6th chapters of this second Aranyaka constitute what is known as Aitareya Upanishad.

The third Aranyaka in this chain of Aranyakas is also known as ‘Samhitopanishad’. This elaborates on the various ways – like pada-paatha, krama-paatha, etc. – of reciting the Vedas and the nuances of the ‘svaras’.

The fourth and the fifth Aranyaka are technical and dwell respectively on the mantras known as ‘MahaanaamnI’ and the yajna known as ‘Madhyandina’.

=== Taittiriya Aranyaka ===

There are ten chapters, of which, one to six form the Aranyaka proper. The first two chapters are part of the aṣṭau kāṭhakāni (the &quot;8 Kathaka sections&quot;), which were not native to the tradition of the Taittiriya shakha. They were adopted from the Kāṭhaka shakha, and mostly deal with varieties of the Agnicayana ritual and with Vedic study.

Chapter 1, is a very late Vedic chapter, which even has some Puranic names; it is usually called the Āruṇa praśna for the particular styleof fire-brick piling dealt with in the text. It is also referred to as the &quot;Surya namaskara chapter&quot; by South Indian Brahmins who have created a ritual of reciting it with surya namaskara exercises after each of its 132 anuvakas. Parts of the Kaṭha version of this section has been published by L. v. Schroeder in 1898.
Chapter 2, discusses the five Mahā-yajñas that every Brahmin has to do daily, most importantly the daily recitation of the Veda (svādhyāya). Further, the sacred thread, the yajñopavīta, sāndhyā worship, that of the ancestors (pitṛ), the brahma-yajña, and the cleansing homa-sacrifice (&#x27;kūṣmāṇḍa-homa&#x27;) are all treated in detail. – In this chapter the word &#x27;shramana&#x27; is used (2-7-1) in the meaning of an ascetic (tapasvin); this word was later used also for the Buddhist and Jain ascetics. – Discussed and translated by Ch. Malamoud (in French, 1977); the Kaṭha version of this section has been published by L. v. Schroeder in 1898.

Chapter 3, treats technicalities of several other homas and yajnas.

Chapter 4, provides the mantras used in the pravargya Shrauta ritual that is considered to be dangerous as it involves heating a specially prepared clay vessel full of milk until it is glowing red. 
It is fairly close to the Kaṭha version.

Chapter 5, treats the Pravargya-yajña in prose discussion (brāhmaṇa style). 
Again, it is fairly close to the Kaṭha version.

Chapter 6, records the ‘pitṛmedha’ mantras, recited during the rituals for the disposal of the dead body.

Chapters 7, 8 and 9, are the three vallis of the well-known Taittiriya Upanishad.

Chapter 10, is also known as the &quot;Mahanarayana Upanishad&quot;. It has several important mantras culled from the three Samhitas. TA 10.41–44 is known as the &quot;Medha sukta&quot;.

===Katha Aranyaka===
The Katha Aranyaka is fairly parallel to the text of the Taittiriyas. It has been preserved, somewhat fragmentarily, in just one Kashmiri birchbark manuscript. It has recently been edited and translated, cf. the early uncritical print by L. von Schroeder

=== Kaushitaki Āranyaka ===
It is also known as Shankhyayana Aranyaka. There are fifteen chapters:

Chapters 1–2 deal with the Mahavrata.

Chapters 3–6 constitute the Kaushitaki Upanishad.

Chapters 7–8 are known as a Samhitopanishad.

Chapter 9 presents the greatness of Prana.

Chapter 10 deals with the esoteric implications of the Agnihotra ritual. All divine personalities are inherent in the Purusha, just as Agni in speech, Vayu in Prana, the Sun in the eyes, the Moon in the mind, the directions in the ears and water in the potency. The one who knows this, says the Aranyaka, and in the strength of that conviction goes about eating, walking, taking and giving, satisfies all the gods and what he offers in the fire reaches those gods in heaven. (cf.10-1).

Chapter 11 prescribes several antidotes in the form of rituals for warding off death and sickness. It also details the effects of dreams.
Chapter 12 elaborates the fruits of prayer.

Chapter 13 treats more philosophical matters and says one must first attitudinally discard one&#x27;s bodily attachment and then carry on the ‘shravana’, manana and nidhidhyasana and practise all the disciplines of penance, faith, self-control etc.

Chapter 14 gives just two mantras. One extols the “I am Brahman” mantra and says it is the apex of all Vedic mantras. The second mantra declares that one who does not get the meaning of mantras but only recites vedic chants is like an animal which does not know the value of the weight it carries.

Chapter 15 gives a long genealogy of spiritual teachers from Brahma down to Guna-Sankhayana.

=== Brihad-Aranyaka ===

The Aranyaka of the Shukla Yajurveda is part of its Brahmana: Satapatha Br. 14,1–3 in the Madhyandina version. Like the Taittiriya and Katha Aranyakas it exclusively deals with the Parvargya ritual, and is followed by the Brihad-Aranyaka Upanishad (Satapatha Br. 14.4–9).

== Rahasya Brahmanas ==
There is also a certain continuity of the Aranyakas from the Brahmanas in the sense that the Aranyakas go into the meanings of the &#x27;secret&#x27; rituals not detailed in the Brahmanas. Later tradition sees this as a leap into subtlety that provides the reason for Durgacharya in his commentary on the Nirukta to say that the Aranyakas are ‘Rahasya Brahmana’, that is, the Brahmana of secrets.

<doc id="321948" wikidata="Q1063649" url="?curid=321948" title="Elis">
<text>Elis also known as Ellis or Ilia (, &quot;Eleia&quot;) is a historic region in the western part of the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece. It is administered as a regional unit of the modern region of Western Greece. Its capital is Pyrgos. Until 2011 it was Elis Prefecture, covering the same territory.

The modern regional unit is nearly coterminous with the ancient Elis of the classical period. Here lie the ancient ruins of cities of Elis, Epitalion and Olympia, known for the ancient Olympic Games which started in 776 BC.

==Geography==

The northernmost point of Elis is 38° 06&#x27;N, the westernmost is 22° 12′E, the southernmost is 37° 18′N, and the easternmost is 21° 54′E. The length from north to south is , and from east-to-west is around .

The modern regional unit is not completely congruent with ancient Elis: Lampeia belonged to ancient Arcadia, and Kalogria is now part of Achaea.

The longest river is the Alfeios. Other rivers are the Erymanthos, Pineios and Neda. Alfeios, Pineios and Neda flow into the Ionian Sea in Elis. Less than 1% of the prefecture is open water, most of it found in artificial reservoirs and dams, in the north and east. The Pineios Dam supplies water for Northern Elis. The water is not safe for drinking, because it contains some contaminants. A second, smaller reservoir in the river Alfeios near Olympia and Krestena supplies water to Pyrgos.

The eastern part of the regional unit is forested, with mostly pine trees in the south. There are forest preserves in Foloi and the mountain ranges of Eastern Elis. In the north is the Strofylia forest which has pine trees. Mountain ranges include Movri (around 720 m or 2,400 ft), Divri (around 1500 m), Minthe (around 1100 m), and more.

About one-third of the land is fertile; the rest is mountainous and not suitable for crops. Swamplands used to cover 1–1.5% of the region, especially in the Samiko area. Most of them have been drained for agricultural purposes; only 10 km² (4 sq miles) has been kept and is now protected.

Here lie the ancient ruins of Elis, Epitalion and Olympia, known for the ancient Olympic Games which started in 776 BC. There is a museum with statues that relate to the history of Olympia. Another museum is in Elis, but it is very small. Monasteries are scattered around the region.

===Climate===

Elis has a Mediterranean climate, with hot, sunny summers. Temperatures over 40 °C have been recorded. The mountainous interior is colder, and snow covers the mountains in winter. Elis is more humid than the eastern Peloponnese.

===Natural disasters===

Elis is located in a seismically active zone, and there are several earthquakes each year. Some of the most significant earthquakes to have hit the area are:
*1909: earthquake in Chavari
*1910: earthquake in Vartholomio
*1920: earthquake in Kyllini
*1953: Ionian earthquake, minor damage in Elis
*2008: 8 June Peloponnese earthquake, 2 deaths; hundreds of damaged homes and buildings were reported in Lechaina, Amaliada and Vartholomio

Rainy weather in 2002-2003 caused destruction of villages by mudslides, and some bridges and roads were also cut off. In February 2008, frost devastated many crops in Manolada, Nea Manolada and Kounoupeli.

In August 2007, there were enormous forest fires which led to tens of deaths and a massive environmental and economic disaster. The final toll for the prefecture was: 45 dead, 100,000 affected by the fire, 3,500 left homeless by the fire, 25,000 dead animals, 8,500 hectares of burnt forests, 2,300 hectares of burnt farmland. The archaeological site of Olympia was seriously threatened, but not damaged.

==Administration==

The regional unit Elis is subdivided into 7 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):
*Ancient Olympia (4)
*Andravida-Kyllini (6)
*Andritsaina-Krestena (3)
*Ilida (2)
*Pineios (7)
*Pyrgos (1)
*Zacharo (5)

===2011 reform===

As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Elis was created out of the former prefecture Elis (). The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.

===Provinces===

Before 2006, Elis was divided into two provinces: Elis Province and Olympia Province. Elis Province contained Hollow or Lowland Elis and the northern part of Pisatis. It was the smallest, but most populous of the two provinces. The seat was Pyrgos. Olympia Province contained most of Pisatis and Triphylia. Its seat was Andritsaina, in the mountains; Krestena and Zacharo were the largest towns in the province.

==Population==

Elis is the third most populous regional unit of the Peloponnese, after Achaea and Messenia. Between 70% and 75% of the population live on fertile lands away from the mountains.

The population of ancient Elis (from 1000–1 BC) was in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 and reached 10,000 or 20,000 by 1 BC. The population reached 217,000 around 1981, but has been declining since. Pyrgos became the largest city having the population over the 10,000 mark in the mid-20th century, and above 20,000 in the late 1980s. The population in the northwest is growing while the population is declining in the southeast and east.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
The primary source of agriculture is corn, tomatoes, potatoes, green peppers, livestock, watermelon, melon and some vegetables. There are 3 major operating tomato factories in Savalia (Kyknos), Gastouni (Pelargos), and north of Andravida (Asteris). The most fertile land in Peloponnese is the plain that covers the northern part of Elis and the adjacent part of Achaea.

Textiles used to be dominant in business from antiquity until the Middle Ages. In the 1950s, agriculture was the dominant occupation, except in the towns Amaliada and Pyrgos. Currently, one third of jobs in Elis is in the agricultural sector.

===Fishing===
Squid, and all types of fish are common in the waters of Elis. Fishing is mainly done in the southeastern Ionian Sea and in the Bay of Patras. Most of the production is sent into Patras, some into Athens, some elsewhere in the world (with small production) and some into the local markets of Elis from Kyllini and Katakolo. Overfishing is a problem north of Lechaina.

==History==

In classical antiquity, Elis was an independent state, centred on the town Elis and included the sanctuary at Olympia, where the Ancient Olympic Games were held between 776 BC and 394 AD. After 146 BC, Elis was part of the province Achaea within the Roman Empire. In the Migration Period (3rd - 4th century AD) Vandals and Visigoths rampaged through the region. After the final partition of the Roman Empire in 395, Elis was ruled by the Byzantine Empire.

In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, crusaders from Western Europe (traditionally referred to as &quot;Franks&quot; in southeastern Europe) established the principality of Achaea in the territory of the defeated Byzantine Empire. The region of Elis was the Principality&#x27;s heartland, containing its capital, Andravida, the port town and mint of Glarentza, the fortress of Chlemoutsi, and the extensive Barony of Akova. The Principality lasted from 1204 until 1432, when it was conquered by the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea, which in turn fell in 1460 to the Ottoman Empire.

The Ottoman Empire ruled most of Greece until the Greek War of Independence of 1821. The Venetian Republic controlled a few coastal towns in the 1490s, early 16th century and from 1686 until 1715. Battlegrounds of the Greek War of Independence in Elis include Chlemoutsi, Gastouni, Lala, Lampeia, Pyrgos and Andritsaina.

As a part of independent Greece, Elis experienced an economic and agricultural upswing in the first decades after the war of independence. Houses were built, and Pyrgos became a regional centre. Like most of the Peloponnese, the area was unaffected during World War I. As a result of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), Greek refugees from Asia Minor settled in the area around Amaliada.

World War II struck parts of Elis, houses were damaged, leaving people homeless, and afterwards the Greek Civil War caused more destruction and economic decline. The return to democracy after the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, and Greece joining the European Communities in 1981 stimulated economic development and improvement of infrastructure.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Elis has 200 km of highways. There are no limited-access freeways in the prefecture, but a freeway (A9) is being built between Patras and Kyparissia, planned opening 2012.

The principal highways include:
* E55 (GR Highway 9), Patras-Pyrgos–Kyparissia, along the western coast of the Peloponnese
* GR Highway 74, Pyrgos–Lagkadia, Tripoli
* GR Highway 76, Pyrgos–Andritsaina–Megalopolis

===Railways===

The total length of railway tracks in Elis is around 140 km. There is a railway line from Patras to Kalamata via Pyrgos, and a branch line from Pyrgos to Olympia. Since January 2011, traffic is suspended on the line from Patras to Kalamata, and only the branch line from Pyrgos to Olympia has regular passenger trains.

===Ports===

The port of Kyllini in the northwest is the busiest port in Elis, with car ferries to the islands of Zakynthos and Kefalonia. The port of Katakolo is an important stop for cruise ships, offering an opportunity for passengers to visit the site of Ancient Olympia. Other ports or harbors are small in size and fit only smaller boats.

===Airports===

Elis has a military airport near Andravida, north of Pyrgos. There are no public airports in the area. The nearest airport on land is in Kalamata.

==Communications==
Telephones became more common after the 1960s when the Hellenic Telecommunication Organization (ΟΤΕ) created hundreds of kilometres of phone lines in the region. Now nearly every household has a telephone. The ΟΤΕ built tens of towers to connect more lines for the internet, telephones, and cell phones to increase the service. Lines began around the mid-20th century to enable more people to communicate by phones in the whole of Greece. There are also several communication towers throughout the prefecture.

*ORT (&quot;Olympiaki Radiofonia Tileorasi&quot;) serves the whole of Elis. ORT is a Polis affiliate.

There are several local radio stations, for instance RSA (Radio Station of Amalias) from Amalias and Eleftheri Radiofonas Krestenas from Krestena. There are hundreds of transmitter towers scattered over Elis.

<text>The Saab 99 is a car produced by Swedish manufacturer Saab from 1968 to 1984; their first foray into a larger class than the Saab 96. While considered a large family car in Scandinavia, it was marketed as a niche compact executive car in most other markets. It was manufactured both in Sweden and Finland and was succeeded by the Saab 900, although the 99 continued to be produced alongside its successor. The Saab 90, an updated, less complex version using many 900 parts took over from the 99 in late 1984.

== Development ==
On 2 April 1964, Gudmund&#x27;s day in Sweden, after several years of planning, the Saab board started &quot;Project Gudmund&quot;. This was a project to develop a new and larger car to take the manufacturer beyond the market for the smaller Saab 96. This new car became the Saab 99, designed by Sixten Sason and unveiled in Stockholm on November 22, 1967.

The first prototypes of the 99 were built by cutting a Saab 96 lengthwise and widening it by ; this created the so-called &quot;Paddan&quot; (The toad), which was a disguise for the new project. After that phase, also as a disguise, the first 99 body shell was badged &quot;Daihatsu&quot; as that name could be made up out of the badging available for the Saab Sport.

The 99 was not only built in Saab&#x27;s own Trollhättan Assembly - some variants were built by the Finnish Valmet Automotive in Uusikaupunki from 1969 onwards; the last five years of this production (1979-1984) was alongside the Finnish built version of the Talbot Horizon, which shared a similar high quality velour upholstery to the 99.
Although Saab engineers liked the company&#x27;s existing two-stroke engine, it was decided that a four-stroke engine was necessary, and the choice was a 1.7 L (later 1.85 L) engine from Triumph. This was the same Triumph Slant-4 engine used in the Triumph Dolomite, but the Saab version was fitted with a Zenith-Stromberg CD carburetor developed specially for Saab. A number of Saab 99s were equipped with a Triumph Stag V8, but the V8 was later dropped in favour of a turbocharged unit which later powered the 99 Turbo.

A three-door estate version was planned from the start, but never made it into production. In 1971 (with thoughts about a combi coupé) the work on an estate was restarted, this time as a five-door.

== Description and reception ==

The first engine used in the original 99 was a four-cylinder in-line engine which was tilted at 45 degrees. The 1709 cc Triumph-sourced engine produced SAE gross at 5500 rpm. The engine was conventionally water-cooled, but unlike most cars of the time it had an electric cooling fan.

Triumph soon upgraded the engine to 1.85 L; the appearance in February 1971 of the four-door Saab 99 (99CM4 series) coincided with the adoption of the new, bored-out, 1854 cc unit. Saab experienced reliability problems with the Triumph-sourced engines and decided to bring the design in-house. From September 1972 the 1985 cc Saab B engine was used. During the lifetime of the 99 model, several subsequent engine developments took place, including the incorporation of fuel injection for some versions.

The 99 was front-wheel-drive, its engine being fitted in a reverse longitudinal position similar to other pre-transverse engine designs like the Citroën Traction Avant, orienting the clutch (or output) towards the front to place the weight of the engine behind the gearbox to avoid nose heaviness. Drive to the under-mounted gearbox was by triplex chain. Front-wheel-drive was still a relatively uncommon configuration at the time of the 99&#x27;s introduction, although traditional in Saabs.

The bonnet (hood) was front-hinged and the panel extended over the front wheel-arches. The windscreen (windshield) was &#x27;wrap-around&#x27; and very deep for the era. The A-pillar had a steep angle, providing excellent driver visibility. The drag coefficient was 0.37 while other cars of the time had 0.4 to 0.5. The chassis was also designed for passive safety, with deformation zones front and rear.

Due to the American sealed beam headlamp requirement in place at the time, the USA models had a special front fascia with four round headlights instead of the two rectangular units it had in other markets. The &quot;US front&quot; then became an item for car customisers in Europe, and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

Early 99s carried over the freewheel transmission from the Saab 96, but the freewheel was removed with the introduction of the 1.85 L engine, likely on account of the extra power that the apparatus would have to transmit. The handbrake was on the front wheels.

The 99 was Saab&#x27;s last factory rally car, first in EMS guise and later as the Turbo version. The Saab 99 Turbo was one of the first &#x27;family cars&#x27; to be fitted with a turbo after the 1962-63 Oldsmobile Turbo Jetfire; other contemporary turbocharged automobiles were &#x27;specialised&#x27; vehicles and were difficult to drive. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; lists the Saab 99 Turbo as number two on its Top Ten list of turbocharged cars of all time.

The UK&#x27;s &quot;Mass Motorist&quot; magazine (1968) summarised their view of the 99 as follows: &quot;That the 99 is comfortable, well-made, satisfying to drive and well-equipped ought to mean that other makers should take heed. The BMW 2002 and Alfa Romeo Giulia are the SAAB 99&#x27;s main rivals. I would contend here that SAAB has the advantage of them, and should SAAB choose to fit an even more powerful motor, the 99 could be a class leader in a short space of time.&quot;

Australia&#x27;s &quot;Wheels magazine&quot; wrote in a July 1978 road test of the 99 Turbo, &quot;Compare the top-gear times and you&#x27;ll see that the Turbo is almost as fast between and in fourth gear as any five-seater in the world&quot;. &quot;Modern Motor&quot; of August 1978 wrote; &quot;It is necessary to drive the car to believe that such a seemingly endless surge of strong acceleration is possible from a 2.0 L engine in a far from lightweight car&quot;.

&quot;Popular Science&quot; wrote &quot;It&#x27;s in the Peugeot/Volvo price class, but in the Colt/Dasher fuel-economy class; and the little four-cylinder overhead-cam engine gives this car V8 agility&quot; and &quot;No American made engine since 1968 can compare with this kind of driveability, and earlier ones are still not equal to the Saab&quot;

A police version of the 99 was also built. The hood/bonnet of the 99 (and also the 900) caused problems for the police livery team. Since it wraps around, covering the wheel arches, the paint had to be extended up onto the hood panel and not restricted to just the fenders as on other cars.

The Saab 99 (saloon model) featured a heating duct leading to the rear window - a lever between the front seats controlled the de-fogging airflow. The 99 featured a floor-located ignition switch which also locked the gear stick (rather than the steering wheel). This arrangement required drivers to select reverse gear before the ignition key could be removed.

== Models ==
*E —Introduced for 1970 (available by order, not from the dealer floor), the 99E (Electronic fuel injection, four-speed manual) was originally only available in a two-door version. The 99 E had the 1709 cc engine displacement Triumph engine giving from Bosch Type-D Jetronic fuel injection instead of the Zenith-Stromberg carburetors. The original carbureted engine produced . Fuel consumption was 7.8 L/100 km (33 mpg) at 105–110 km/h (65-70 mph).
* EMS—Introduced in 1972, the EMS (Electronic fuel injection Manual transmission Special) was a sportier model that was originally only available in a two-door version. Engine was equipped from 1972 to 1974 with Bosch D-jetronic and from 1975 on with Bosch K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection. Despite the fuel system change, letter &quot;e&quot; was kept in model name. In 1977 the EMS became available in the three-door &#x27;wagonback&#x27; body that was introduced for standard models in 1974 (1978 in the USA). It had a stiffer suspension and was sold in yellow or a copper coral metallic paint in &#x27;73, Sterling Silver or Sunset orange in &#x27;74, black or Sterling silver in &#x27;75 and &#x27;76, black, Sterling silver, or Cardinal red in 1977, and Sterling silver or Cardinal red in &#x27;78. The new Swedish-built engine had 1985cc displacement giving and a top speed of . The grille badge differed from the more basic models in &#x27;73 and &#x27;74 only. Other features through the years included quicker steering, luxury interior, soccerball wheels, carpeted trunk, and front air dam.
*SSE—Sold in the US to satisfy demand while the EMS was not yet available there. The SSE had a black or burled walnut vinyl roof cover, a BorgWarner automatic transmission and a 1.85 L Triumph engine.
*X7—Introduced in 1973. A very basic model only sold in Sweden and Denmark. The car had no self-repairing bumpers and it also had the same seats as the V4 Saabs, although these did not include electric heating elements. A simpler heating and ventilation system was also installed. The clock, cigarette lighter, glove compartment and the rear window defogger were also dropped.
*L—Luxe. A budget model introduced in 1973 that came with the 1.85 L engine.
*LE—Equipped with the same fuel-injected engine as the EMS; unknown what years it was produced (at least from 1974).
*GL—Grand Luxe.
*GLE—Grand Luxe with E for INJECTION not executive, introduced in 1976. This was the top model, equipped with fuel injection, power steering (in some markets), and an automatic transmission.
*GLs—Grand Luxe Super. It was the same as a GL but with two carburetors instead of one. It had compared to the in the single-carburetor version.

*Turbo—Introduced in 1978, although 100 pre-series cars were built in 1977. The 99 Turbo was fitted with a turbocharged version of the 2-litre engine. The body was originally a 3-door combi coupé version but later in 1979-80 the company produced a two-door model, which was a limited homologation exercise to enable the production of a rally car. It was available in Cardinal red, Sterling silver, Anthracite grey, and Black; the two-door was available in silver, cardinal red and metallic green. The Turbo S was a special model with factory-mounted water injection, giving an extra 15–20 PS. In 1978 there was a very limited edition of a little over 100 five-door 99 Turbos. They were only available in Cardinal red.


*Finlandia—A limousine version of the Saab 99 GLE combi coupé with a longer wheelbase was introduced in 1977 by Valmet in Uusikaupunki (Nystad), Finland. The Swedish head office was not too fond of this model or the concept of making an executive car out of the 5-door combi coupe. And so it was only sold in Finland and never given an official designation by Trollhättan. It was available from local dealers as the Saab 99 &quot;Finlandia&quot;. The first year had a short extension piece between the front and rear doors. In 1978 the wheelbase was slightly shortened to longer than in the standard model but arguably more elegant in execution. The elongation was done discreetly by adding to all four doors, however inside the change was distinct only in the backseat, with significantly increased rear legroom. Three late 99 Finlandias were fitted with turbocharged engines and manual transmissions at the factory.

These cars were inspired by a gift to the Finnish President Urho Kekkonen in the mid 1970&#x27;s by the industrialist and personal friend Marcus Wallenberg Jr., who got the idea at a social function where Kekkonen had complained to him that he disliked his brash and extremely conspicuous Cadillac official state car in a normal setting. According to him, it was not appropriate transportation despite his status as it made him feel unduly elevated above the common people. Aside from an official state visit from abroad or visiting the embassies of superpowers like the Soviet Union or the United States, and other similar functions which necessitated maintaining a different kind of appearance, it was far too exuberant. In addition to which, it strongly stood out from normal Finnish traffic and everybody knew who was in it, making this an obvious security concern. Large luxurious American sedans were extremely rare at the time in Finland. Kekkonen didn&#x27;t have a driver&#x27;s license and preferred to be chauffeured to his official business, but in an inconspicuous fashion. To cater to this, Wallenberg ordered a pine-green Saab 99 and had it elongated by 20 cm, by having 10 cm added to all the doors, at a Swedish coach-builder in Malmö called Heiner`s Mekaniska Verkstad and gave it to Kekkonen as a gift, who loved the car. This was of course widely reported in the press and Finnish political and economic elite liked the idea to the point that Saab-Valmet felt necessary to start emulating the fashion endorsed by the nation&#x27;s head of state. Kekkonen&#x27;s original Wallenberg Special 99 is on display at the Uusikaupunki Automobile Museum, which also chronicles the history of Saab (and other makes) and the various specialized models developed as concept cars or manufactured at the Valmet factory. The tradition continued with the Saab 900 Finlandia in 1979, which was then from 1982 sold as the 900 CD with most ordered examples being 4 door-sedans, instead of 5 door combi coupés. One LWB 900 5D combi coupé aka &quot;The last Saab Finlandia&quot; was delivered to Finnish paper-mill giant Metsä Group in 1983.
*Petro-Multifuel engine designed to run on either gasoline or kerosene. Produced 1979–1981 in Uusikaupunki and only sold in Finland. Developed due raising fuel prices to be an alternative or replacement for a diesel engine which was missing from Saab&#x27;s model line.

== History ==
The 99 was first shown on November 22, 1967. The first production cars came in autumn 1968, although only 4190 cars were built this year. Production increased considerably in 1969 and again in 1970 when the four-door model arrived. In 1970 the interior was also given a facelift and became more luxurious, with a new steering wheel. The exhaust system was now made of aluminum, engine mounts and drive joints were changed. In March, the 99E (also available with a three-speed automatic transmission) was introduced. It had a 1.75 L engine with electronically controlled fuel injection, giving . The 1970 99 was also the first passenger vehicle to be sold with the headlamp wipers in Swedish market as standard, two years before they became mandatory in Sweden.

In 1971 the 99 was given a larger and stronger engine, a 1.85 L engine giving on the carbureted model and for the fuel-injected model. The 1.75 L engine was now only available with a carburetor. Saab also introduced headlight wipers, as well as larger rear-view mirrors and an additional air inlet beneath the existing grille. The dashboard was given a redesign along with new instruments.

In 1972 the 1.75 L engine was no longer available. The power of the engine was increased to for carbureted models and for fuel-injected models. The 2.0 L engine became available. The major change this year were new plastic bumpers that could take impacts up to and still retain their shape. The suspension was stiffened and received stronger dampers. An electrically heated driver&#x27;s seat was also introduced. In January 1972 the 99 EMS (&quot;Electronic-Manual-Special&quot;) was introduced. It was a sportier model that was originally only available in a two-door version; but became available in the wagonback body beginning in 1974 (Europe). It had stiffer suspension and also silver or copper (&#x27;bronze&#x27;)-colored metallic paint as option. The engine had 1985 cc displacement and Bosch D-Jetronic electronic fuel injection giving and a top speed of .

For the United States, a special 99 SSE was developed to satisfy demand while the EMS was not yet available there. The SSE had a black or burled walnut vinyl roof cover and an automatic transmission (by Borg-Warner). It also had the 1.85 L Triumph engine installed.

In 1973 a low-cost model called the 99L was introduced. It was a two-door with a 1.85 L engine giving . All other models had the Swedish-built 2.0 L engine, which produces in carburetted form. The LE model had electronic fuel injection giving . The LE model was mainly made for export. The inner ceiling was changed, as were protective bars in the doors, and a new black grille. In Northern Europe, a de-contented model called the 99 X7 was also marketed.
In January 1974 the three-door hatchback combi coupé (marketed as a &quot;Wagon Back&quot; in the USA) was introduced. It was longer than the sedan. Front seats and steering wheel were new for 1974, while the EMS received an all-new, model-specific interior. Inertial reel belts were also fitted.

In 1975 the brakes were improved and the hand brake now worked directly on the primary brake pads instead of on separate pads acting as drum brakes inside the brake rotor. The 99 was now available in two versions, one with a carburetor with and a fuel-injected version using Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system giving . In February a model using Zenith-Stromberg 150CDS(E) dual carburetors was introduced. It was only available for the combi coupé and has . The combi coupé had been fitted with a unique grille in 1974; this was now applied across the range.

In 1976 nothing major was changed, but a self-adjusting clutch was introduced. The engines were adapted for tougher emissions requirements and several models with an electrically heated rear window were introduced. A luxurious 4-door sedan model was available, the 99 GLE. it came with power steering, an automatic transmission, a fuel-injected engine, luxurious upholstery on the seats and an armrest in the rear seat. The five-door combi coupé model was also introduced.

In 1977, the front light clusters and the sedan&#x27;s tail lights were enlarged. The rubber strips on the bumpers were changed. The &quot;One Hundred series&quot; of test-fleet Turbo cars were distributed around the world. The cars were mainly made from three- and two-door EMS models, but a few four-door and even five-door cars were also made. The four- and five-door models were tested by mostly police in Sweden, Finland and Switzerland.

In 1978 a turbocharged version of the car, the 99 Turbo, was introduced. It was only available as a combi coupé until the next year. The turbocharged two-liter engine produced giving the car a top speed of . The turbochargers were designed and built by Garrett AiResearch. In terms of appearance, it received distinctive alloy wheels and front and rear spoilers. The 99 Turbo repositioned Saab in the car market and it came to be regarded as an iconic and technologically significant model of its era. By early 1979, over 10,000 turbo-engined Saabs had already been built, as Saab successfully entered a new market segment. Other news for 1978 included the availability of a sunroof, and the EMS became a three-door combi coupé in some markets.

In 1979 the combi coupé option was discontinued for the 99, as the new Saab 900 was only available in this bodystyle. The 99 Turbo changed over to the two-door saloon bodywork although only a small number were built. The rear axle was altered, the fuel tank changed to a plastic one, new wheels were fitted, and four-door models received new bumpers similar to those of the 900. These bumpers were also installed on two-doors beginning with the 1980 model year. In 1980 the 99 was also given the new and safer seats from the Saab 900, as well as low-mounted protective strips along the sides. The spare wheel was changed to an emergency unit. The carpeting, which had been changed to rubber a few years earlier, went back to textile. In the Swedish market the twin-carb version made a return for a single year, sold as the 99 Super and only available with four doors and an automatic transmission.

In 1981 the twin-carb Super was discontinued, although the 99 did gain a new engine option in its stead: the 99 GL with was joined by the 99 GLi with , both with four-speed manual transmissions. The GLi was a bit more luxurious and had power side mirrors. It was only sold in Northern Europe and only around 1600 were built. All 99s received a new rear seat, velour upholstery, new rear mirrors, a new steering wheel, and the 900&#x27;s front axle.

In 1982 came the H engine, built by Scania at Södertälje, making it possible for all cars to run on 93 octane gasoline. The two- and four-door 99 GLs were now available with a five-speed manual transmission. The window surround trim was blacked out and the wheels were new.

In 1983 a number of smaller technical and cosmetic changes were made, including a new grille similar to that of the 900 and blacked out B-pillars on two-door models. Brake pads were now asbestos-free. Five-speed-equipped 99s received low-resistance tires, which sit on wider 5½-inch rims, requiring moving the rear axle. Some further minor changes took place for 1984, including electronic ignition, lowered seats, and a more upright steering wheel. Five-speed cars also received interval wipers. This was to be the final year for the 99. It was replaced by the Saab 90 and the Saab 900.

A total of 588,643 were made; this total rises to 614,003 if Saab 90 production is included.

<text>Vlach ( ), also Wallachian and many other variants, is a term and exonym used from the Middle Ages until the Modern Era to designate speakers of Eastern Romance languages living in Southeast Europe—south of the Danube (the Balkan peninsula) and north of the Danube.

Although it has also been used to name present-day Romanians, the term &quot;Vlach&quot; today refers primarily to speakers of the Eastern Romance languages who live south of the Danube, in Albania, Bulgaria, northern Greece, North Macedonia and eastern Serbia. These people include the ethnic groups of the Aromanians, the Megleno-Romanians and, in Serbia, the Timok Romanians. The term also became a synonym in the Balkans for the social category of shepherds, and was also used for non-Romance-speaking peoples, in recent times in the western Balkans derogatively. The term is also used to refer to the ethnographic group of Moravian Vlachs who speak a Slavic language but originate from Romanians, as well as for Morlachs and Istro-Romanians.

== Etymology ==
 The word &quot;Vlach&quot;/&quot;Wallachian&quot; (and other variants such as &quot;Vlah&quot;, &quot;Valah&quot;, &quot;Valach&quot;, &quot;Voloh&quot;, &quot;Blac&quot;, &quot;Oláh&quot;, &quot;Vlas&quot;, &quot;Ilac&quot;, &quot;Ulah&quot;, etc.) is etymologically derived from the ethnonym of a Celtic tribe, adopted into Proto-Germanic &quot;*Walhaz&quot;, which meant &#x27;stranger&#x27;, from &quot;*Wolkā-&quot; (Caesar&#x27;s , Strabo and Ptolemy&#x27;s ). Via Latin, in Gothic, as , the ethnonym took on the meaning &#x27;foreigner&#x27; or &#x27;Romance-speaker&#x27; and later &quot;shepherd&#x27;, &#x27;nomad&#x27;. The term was adopted into Greek as &quot;Vláhoi&quot; or &quot;Blachoi&quot; (), Albanian , Slavic as &quot;Vlah&quot; () or &quot;Voloh&quot;, Hungarian as &quot;oláh&quot; and &quot;olasz&quot;, etc. The root word was notably adopted in Germanic for Wales and Walloon, and in Switzerland for Romansh-speakers (), and in Poland &quot;Włochy&quot; or in Hungary &quot;olasz&quot; became an exonym for Italians. The Slovenian term &quot;Lahi&quot; has also been used to designate Italians. The same name is still used in Polish (&quot;Włochy, Włosi, włoskie&quot;) and Hungarian (&quot;Olasz, Olaszország&quot;) as an exonym for Italy, while in Slovak (&quot;Vlach&quot; - pl. &quot;Vlasi&quot;, &quot;Valach&quot; - pl. &quot;Valasi&quot;), Czech (&quot;Vlachy&quot;) and Slovenian (&quot;Laško&quot;, &quot;Láh, Láhinja,&quot; &quot;laško&quot;) it was replaced with the endonym &quot;Italia&quot;.

Other forms which were recognised by linguists to designate the &quot;Vlachs&quot; are: &quot;Blaci&quot;, &quot;Blauen&quot;, &quot;Blachi&quot; found in Western medieval sources, &quot;Balachi, Walati&quot; found in Western sources derived from medieval German, while the Germanic population from Transylvania used also the variants &quot;Woloch&quot;, &quot;Blôch&quot;. French sources used mostly &quot;Valaques&quot; while the medieval Song of Roland used &quot;Blos&quot;. In English and in modern German the forms &quot;Wallachians&quot;, &quot;Walachen&quot; appear, respectively. In the Balkan Peninsula various names such as &quot;Rumer&quot;, &quot;Tzintzars&quot;, &quot;Morlachs&quot;, &quot;Maurovlachs&quot;, &quot;Armâns&quot;, &quot;Cincars&quot;, &quot;Koutzovlachs&quot; were used, while Muslim sources speak of &quot;Ulak&quot;, &quot;Ilak&quot;, &quot;Iflak&quot;.

== Historical uses ==

The term &#x27;Vlach&#x27; first appeared in medieval sources and was generally used as an exonym for speakers of the Eastern Romance languages. But testimonies from the 13th and the 14th centuries show that, although in Europe and beyond, they were called &quot;Vlachs&quot; or &quot;Wallachians&quot; (&quot;oláh&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;Vláchoi&quot; (Βλάχοι) in Greek, &quot;Volóxi&quot; (Воло́хи) in Russian, &quot;Walachen&quot; in German, &quot;Valacchi&quot; in Italian, &quot;Valaques&quot; in French, &quot;Valacos&quot; in Spanish), the Romanians used the endonym or , from the Latin , meaning &#x27;Roman&#x27;. Also Aromanians use the endonym (: ) or (: ), from . From Latin are also the Albanian forms and , &#x27;vlach&#x27;. Megleno-Romanians designate themselves with the Macedonian form &quot;Vla&quot; (: &quot;Vlaš&quot;) in their own language.

In historical sources the term &quot;Vlach&quot; could also refer to different peoples: &quot;Slovak, Hungarian, Balkan, Transylvanian, Romanian, or even Albanian&quot;. In late Byzantine documents, the Vlachs are sometimes mentioned as Bulgaro-Albano-Vlachs (&quot;Bulgaralbanitoblahos&quot;), or Serbo-Albano-Bulgaro-Vlachs. According to the Serbian historian Sima Ćirković, the name &quot;Vlach&quot; in medieval sources had the same rank as the name &quot;Greek&quot;, &quot;Serb&quot; or &quot;Latin&quot;.
In the Western Balkans, during the High Middle Ages, the word also acquired a socio-economic component, being used as an internal name for the pastoral population in the medieval Kingdom of Serbia, one that was also often engaged in the transport of goods, colonisation of empty lands, and military service. It will then expand to local interpretations with religious, ethnic, and social status particularities across the wider region, being employed as a name for Eastern Romance speaking people, Eastern Orthodox population in opposition to Catholic population, for the rural population of the hinterlands, the Christian population in general as opposed to Muslim population, or a combination of these aspects. During the early history of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, there was a military class of Vlachs in Serbia and Ottoman Macedonia, made up of Christians who served as auxiliary forces and were exempted of certain taxes until the beginning of the 17th century. In this context, a large part of the Dalmatian hinterland was repopulated by Slavic settlers, both Orthodox and Catholic, speaking the Shtokavian dialect and called Vlach or Morlach by the inhabitants of the Dalmatian coast and islands. In these areas, the term &quot;Vlah&quot; evolved to &quot;Vlaj&quot; () and is still used as a derogatory term to refer to the rural inhabitants of the hinterland, both Croats and Serbs, as &quot;peasants&quot; and &quot;ignorants&quot;. In Istria, the ethnonym Vlach is used by the Chakavian-speaking Croatian inhabitants to refer to the Istro-Romanians and the Slavs who settled in the 15th and 16th centuries.

Nowadays, the term &quot;Vlachs&quot; (also known under other names, such as &quot;Koutsovlachs&quot;, &quot;Tsintsars&quot;, &quot;Karagouni&quot;, &quot;Chobani&quot;, &quot;Vlasi&quot;, etc.) is used in scholarship for the Eastern Romance-speaking communities in the Balkans, especially those in Greece, Albania and North Macedonia. In Serbia the term &quot;Vlach&quot; (Serbian &quot;Vlah&quot;, plural &quot;Vlasi&quot;) is also used to refer to Romanian speakers, especially those living in eastern Serbia.

In modern Slovak, &quot;Valasi&quot;, other than denoting people of Vlachian ethnicity or origin, is synonymously and even more prominently used to describe shepherds, more commonly apprentice shepherds. The term originated following Vlachian arrival in mounts and hills of present-day Slovakia in 14th century and coinciding development in sheep herding and dairy industry. Further west, in Czech Republic, the area of Moravian Wallachia is known as Valašsko and the inhabitants as Valaši, names usually translated in English as Wallachia and Wallachians, respectively.

== History ==


According to the theory of Daco-Roman continuity, the ancestors of modern Vlachs and Romanians originated from Dacians. For proponents of this theory, Eastern Romance languages prove the survival of the Thraco-Romans in the lower Danube basin during the Migration Period. On the other hand, opponents of this theory say that the Romanians and the Vlachs, including the ancestors of present-day Aromanians, were originally part of the same group of speakers of Eastern Romance languages, and that their origins should be sought in the southern Balkans. Early Romanian-speakers would have then moved northwards from the 12th century onwards.

=== 7th century ===
The first likely attestation of Romanian language and implicitly of Vlachs/Romanians comes from Theophylactus Simocatta Histories, written 630, narrating an episode from Maurice&#x27;s Balkan campaigns:
=== 10th century ===
During the Middle Ages, the term &quot;Magna Vlachia&quot; appears in Byzantine documents. This name was used for Thessaly and present-day North Macedonia.

John Skylitzes mentioned the Vlachs in 976, as guides and guards of Byzantine caravans in the Balkans. Between Prespa and Kastoria, they met and fought with David of Bulgaria. The Vlachs killed David in their first documented battle.

Ibn al-Nadīm published in 998 the work &quot;Kitāb al-Fihrist&quot; mentioning &quot;Turks, Bulgars and &quot;Blaghā&quot;&quot;. According to B. Dodge the ethnonym &quot;Blaghā&quot; could refer to Wallachians/Romanians. It is important to note, however, that the original Arabic text does not contain the word &quot;Blaghā&quot; but rather &quot;البلغار,&quot; which translates to &quot;al-Bulghār,&quot; the term used in contemporary Arabic texts to refer to Volga Bulgaria. The new Arabic edition also features the word &quot;al-Bulghār&quot; (&quot;البلغار&quot;) instead of &quot;Blaghā.&quot; Furthermore, the first critical edition edited by Gustav Flügel in 1871, which includes the original Arabic text, likewise uses the designation &quot;البلغار&quot; (&quot;al-Bulghār&quot;). The word &quot;البلغار&quot; (&quot;al-Bulghār&quot;) appears instead of &quot;البلغم&quot; (&quot;al-Blagham&quot;) in both the 1971/1973/1988 Tehran/Beirut/Cairo critical editions as well. Thus, Bayard&#x27;s translation is incorrect, as he mistakenly read &quot;البلغار&quot; (&quot;al-Bulghār&quot;) as &quot;البلغم&quot; (&quot;al-Blagham&quot;). Therefore, the original Arabic text refers to Volga Bulgaria, not the Vlachs.

A monastic document from Mount Athos mentions that 300 Vlach families live near the mountain, and in their own language they call their settlements &quot;Catuns&quot;.

Byzantine writer Kekaumenos, author of the &quot;Strategikon&quot; (1078), writes about a leader, Nikulitsa, who is given command by Basil II over the Vlachs in Hellas theme. Nikulitsa switched alliance to Samuel of Bulgaria after the conquest of Larissa by the Bulgarian Tsar.

Mutahhar al-Maqdisi, &quot;They say that in the Turkic neighbourhood there are the Khazars, Russians, Slavs, &quot;Waladj&quot;, Alans, Greeks and many other peoples.&quot; According to other non-Romanian historians, based on the context, the &quot;Waladj&quot; are not the Vlachs, but a people living around the Volga.

=== 11th century ===

Vlachs were present in large numbers, on the Chalcidice peninsula around 1000, according to monastic documents from Mount Athos. On the peninsula, the Vlachs were famous for their cheese and meat products. In these texts sometimes they are called &quot;Vlachorynhinii&quot;, which may be a mixture of the name &quot;Vlach&quot; and &quot;Rynhini&quot; a Slavic tribe who settled in the same area in the 7th century.

In 1013, a Byzantine document mentions the settlement of &quot;Kimbalongu&quot; in the mountains near Strumitsa, which was a Vlach settlement.

The names &quot;Blakumen&quot; or &quot;Blökumenn&quot; is mentioned in Nordic sagas dating between the 11th and 13th centuries, with respect to events that took place in either 1018 or 1019 somewhere at the northwestern part of the Black Sea and believed by some to be related to the &quot;Vlachs&quot;. Omeljan Pritsak, however, point out that the texts probably refer to a nomadic Turkic people, since the &quot;Blakumen&quot; in the texts are &quot;non-christian heathens&quot; and nomadic horsemans. Spinei contrasts Pritsak&#x27;s view by claiming that there are several mentions of the &quot;Blakumen&quot; or &quot;Blökumen&quot; in contexts taking place decades before the earliest appearance of the Cumans in the Pontic steppe, and that translating the name to &quot;Black Cumans&quot; is not concordant with the Varangian ethnic terminology.

In 1020, the Archdiocese of Ohrid was founded, which was responsible for &quot;the spiritual care of all the Vlachs&quot;.

In 1022, Vlach shepherds from Thessaly and the Pindus mountains provided cheese for Constantinople.

In 1025, the Annales Barenses mentions a people called &quot;Vlach&quot; who live near the river Axios.

The same chronicle the Annales Barenses describes that in 1027 the Byzantine army led by Orestes that tried to recapture Sicily from the Arabs, also included many Vlachs recruited from Macedonia.

Kekaumenos writes about the revolt in 1066 in the region of Thessaly led by Nikoulitzas Delphinas, nephew of the homonymous 10th century military commander, and father in law of the writer.

In 1071, a Byzantine document mentions that the herds of the Vlachs and their household spend the months of April to September beyond Thessaly, in the high mountains of Bulgaria, where it is very cold. (it is clear from the text that we are talking about the mountains of today&#x27;s North Macedonia). The same text describes that the homeland of the Vlachs is Thessaly, precisely the part of the region divided by the river Pleres. Florin Curta adds that Kekaumenos calls Vlachs &quot;migrants from the northern parts&quot;, as Kekaumenos associates them with Dacians or Bessi of Antiquity.

A Byzantine author, Kekaumenos writes about the Vlachs in Greece in connection about their origin and way of life in the &quot;Strategikon&quot; in 1075–1078. According to Kekaumenos, the Vlachs were Dacians and Bessi, who lived near and south from the Danube and the Sava, where the Serbs live now. They feigned loyalty to the Romans while they were constantly attacked and pillaged, therefore, Trajan launched a war, their leader, Decebalus was also killed, and then the Vlachs were scattered in Macedonia, Epirus and Hellas.

According to Hungarian historians, Kekaumenos made the Dacians the ancestors of the Vlachs because he knew about the deceitfulness of the Dacians against the Romans, and according to him the Dacians and Vlachs had a perfectly matching nature, treachery and political unreliability, so much that in his opinion they should not be believed even if the Vlachs take an oath. Kekaumenos arbitrarily identified the Vlachs with the Dacians according to the archaizing efforts of his time, because the tendency to refer to later peoples with classical names was common in Byzantium at the time of Kekaumenos. Kekaumenos also confused the Roman province Dacia Traiana with Dacia Aureliana, and even he placed it further west where it actually was, that is why he mentioned the Serbian territory as the homeland, the Bessus tribe was a neighbor of the Roman province Macedonia.

Alexius Komnenos mentions that in 1082 he passed through a Vlach settlement called Exeva in Macedonia.

Anna Komnene mentions in her Alexiad that in 1091 Emperor Alexios ordered Nikephoros Melissenos to raise an army against invading Pechenegs. Melissenos recruited, among others, Bulgarians and &quot;the nomadic tribes called Vlachs in popular parlance&quot;.

According to the Alexiad, in 1094–1095, Emperor Alexius Komnenos was notified by a Vlach chieftain called Poudila about the crossing of the Danube by a Cuman army, and that to prepare himself for the attack, then the Vlachs likewise led the Cumans through the gorges of the Balkan Mountains.

Also in 1094 the first mention of Vlachs in Moglena region is made, the document is kept in the archive of the monastery Great Lavra on Mount Athos. According to this Emperor Alexios I Komnenos replies to the monks of the monastery complaining that people on their domain are not paying taxes. The document contains some of the first Romanian names, such as Stan, Radu cel Şchiop, and Peducel.

In 1097, many Vlachs were resettled from the Chalcidice peninsula to the Peloponnese by order of the Byzantine emperor Alexios Komnenos.

In 1099, crusading armies were attacked by Vlachs, in the mountains along the road from Braničevo to Naissus.

=== 12th century ===
The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, written states that the Slavs settled beside the Danube, then the &quot;Volochi&quot; people attacked the Slavs, settled among them and did them violence, leading to the Slavs departing and settling around the Vistula under the name of &quot;Leshi&quot;. According to the chronicle the Slavs settled there first, and the &quot;Volochi&quot; seized the territory of the Slavs; later, the Hungarians drove the &quot;Volochi&quot; away, took their land and settled among the Slavs. The Primary Chronicle thus contains a possible reference to Romanians. Other non-Romanian historians consider the &quot;Volochi&quot; the Franks, as their country is placed west to Baltic Sea and near England by the author of the work, Nestor the Chronicler. The Frankish Empire stretched from the North Sea to the Danube.

The Byzantine princess and scholar Anna Komnene, in her book Alexiad, mentions a Vlach settlement called Ezeba, which was near Larissa and Androneia. In the same work she also describes the Vlachs as &quot;the nomadic tribes, called Vlachs in popular parlance&quot;.

In 1109, monks on Mount Athos mention the Vlachs in Chalkidiki and that the presence of women disturbed the monachal activities.

Traveler Benjamin of Tudela (1130–1173) of the Kingdom of Navarre was one of the first writers to use the word &quot;Vlachs&quot; for a Romance-speaking population. In his work he mentions that these Vlachs live high up in the mountains of Thessaly, and from there they sometimes come down to plunder, which they do quickly, as swift as deers, for which reasons there is no king to rule them.

In 1167, Vlachs living by the border of the Principality of Halych during the reign of Yaroslav Osmomysl, captured Andronicus and returned him to Emperor Manuel.

Byzantine historian John Kinnamos described Leon Vatatzes&#x27; military expedition along the northern Danube, where Vatatzes mentioned the participation of Vlachs in battles with the Magyars (Hungarians) in 1167. John Kinnamos says Vlachs were &quot;colonists brought from Italy&quot;.

The uprising of brothers Asen and Peter was a revolt of Bulgarians and Vlachs living in the theme of Paristrion of the Byzantine Empire, caused by a tax increase. It began on 26 October 1185, the feast day of St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki, and ended with the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire, also known in its early history as the Empire of Bulgarians and Vlachs.

According to Niketas Choniates, after the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos lost his wife, he wanted to marry the daughter of Bela III of Hungary, but there was not enough money for the wedding, so he imposed taxes in the regions and cities of the empire, but he angered the &quot;barbarians who dwelt in the Haemos mountains, who were once called Moesians, but are now called Vlachs&quot;.

Mentions of Vlachs in Medieval Bulgaria also come from Niketas Choniates who writes about a Vlach called Dobromir Chrysos who established an autonomous polity in the upper region of Vardar river and Moglena. A similar event is recorded by the same author in the area of Philippopolis where a Vlach called Ivanko, formerly a boyar at the Asen brothers&#x27; court was given military command by Emperor Isaac and expanded his rule to Smolyan, Mosynopolis, and Xanthi.

According to Niketas Choniates, Thessaly and Macedonia is called &quot;Magna Vlachia&quot;, Aetolia and Acarnata are called &quot;Little Vlachia&quot; and north-eastern Epirus is called &quot;Upper Vlachia&quot;.

According to Niketas Choniates, the Vlachs are the barbarians who live in the Balkan mountains, in Moesia.

In 1183 Hungarian documents mention, that King Béla III of Hungary, in his campaign against the Byzantine Empire, sacked Sofia, and among the defenders there were many Vlachs. The King used the opportunity and &quot;... took home a number of these valiant mountain soldiers, and settled them in the Szeben County.&quot;

A Byzantine church document mentions that in 1190, &quot;the Cumans and the Vlachs take the relics of Saint Ryli from Sofia to Tirnovo with a great pomp.&quot;

According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja&quot;, the authenticity of which is highly disputed by historians, AD the Avars conquered Salona, then, attacking further south, ravaged Macedonia and the &quot;land of the black Latins, now called Morvlachs&quot;.

The first mention of Vlachs in Serbian medieval chronicles is dated from the time of Stefan Nemanjić, most probably 1198–1199, and it is related to a donation act towards restoration of Hilandar monastery with aid from the inhabitants of the area of Prizren.

The &quot;History of the Expedition of the Emperor Frederick&quot; mention the Vlachs as people living in the mountains and forests of the Balkans. The chronicle also describes the Vlachs&#x27; homeland as being near Thessaloniki. The chronicle describes how the Crusaders captured several Vlachs who told them that the Vlachs live in Macedonia, Thessaly and Bulgaria, and that because they were heavily taxed, they were rebelling.

Numerous Serbian documents from the very end of the 12th century speak of Vlach shepherds in the mountains between the Drina and the Morava.

=== 13th century ===
Kaloyan was given the title (&quot;Emperor Kaloyan, Lord of All Bulgarians and Vlachs&quot;) by Patriarch Basil I of Bulgaria and the title (&quot;King of the Bulgarians and the Vlachs&quot;) by Pope Innocent II.

In 1204 and 1205 Raimbaut de Vaqueiras mentions the Vlachs as enemies of Boniface of Montferrat.

After 1207 Geoffrey of Villehardouin mentions twelve times the Vlachs part of the armies of Kaloyan of Bulgaria, either as defenders against Henry of Flanders or among the attackers of Adrianopole.

Around the same time Henry of Valenciennes writes about the country he calls &quot;Blasquie&quot; ruled by &quot;Burile&quot; (Borilă). Henry of Flanders conquers this land and awards it to &quot;Burile&#x27;s&quot; cousin &quot;Esclas&quot; (Slav). From there on the country will be known as &quot;Blakie la Grant&quot; (Great Valachia).

Sándor Timaru-Kast alleges that the Venetian Chronicle refers to the land that would become Wallachia as &quot;Black Cumania&quot;, &quot;the colony of black Vlachs who migrated northwards&quot;.

According to the medieval Hungarian chronicle, the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; (&quot;The deeds of the Hungarians&quot;), written in the early 13th century, when the Hungarians of Grand Prince Árpád conquered the Carpathian Basin, at that time Slavs, Bulgarians and &quot;Blachij&quot;, and also the shepherds of the Romans (&quot;sclauij, Bulgarij et Blachij, ac pastores romanorum&quot;) inhabited Pannonia. Most researchers say that the &quot;Blachij&quot; are the Vlachs, some Hungarian scholars claim that they are the Bulaqs, a Turkic people. László Makkai writes that &quot;this hypothesis does not bear the test of scholarly scrutiny&quot;. The chronicle&#x27;s authenticity is in question in historiography, because it confuses the peoples living in the area in the 12th century and the peoples of the 9th century. Among others, it includes the Cumans in Transylvania, who arrived only centuries later. Romanian historian Ioan-Aurel Pop states that some exaggerations and inaccuracies, typical of a chronicle at the time and mostly in favour of the Royal House, are not a sufficient reason to discredit the entire document as a historical source. It is important to note, however, that the chronicle mentions many rulers, but none of them is mentioned in any other contemporary chronicle. According to Romanian historian Florin Curta and leading Romanian medievalist Radu Popa, during the 1960–1989 period, the archaeological evidences were manipulated to meet the demands of the nationalist policies of the Ceaușescu&#x27;s regime, and Romanian archaeologists made every possible attempt to prove that the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; is a reliable source for the Romanian presence in Transylvania prior to the Hungarian conquest, however no archaeological evidence was found to prove the subject. Hungarian archaeologist István Bóna also accused Romanian archaeologists of hiding evidence that did not fit their interpretation regarding the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; during the excavation of the early medieval hillfort at Dăbâca as Gelou&#x27;s capital city.&quot;&quot; Whether archeology supports the &quot;Gesta&quot; or not is disputed among historians. British-Romanian historian Dennis Deletant states the analysis of the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; shows that is too naive to claim it is an immaculate source, just as it is foolhardy to totally discredit its reliability, and the conclusion, the cases for and against the existence of Gelou and the Vlachs simply cannot be proven. British historian Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes in his critical and analytical guide of Anonymus that all Romanian historians refer to Anonymus, but they are not credible in the subject and the chronicle is not evidence for presence of Vlachs in Transylvania. Madgearu attempts to prove that a Vlach-Slav population existed in Transylvania before the arrival of the Hungarians by recounting place names of Slavic origin he believes weren&#x27;t adopted to Romanian via Hungarian.

In 1213, an army of Vlachs, Saxons and Pechenegs, led by the Count of Sibiu, Joachim Türje, attacked the Second Bulgarian Empire – Bulgarians and Cumans in the fortress of Vidin. After this, all Hungarian battles in the Carpathian region were supported by Romance-speaking soldiers from Transylvania.

Stefan the First-Crowned donates 200 families of Vlachs from Prokletije and Peći to Žiča monastery.

In 1220, king Stefan the First-Crowned proclaimed that all Vlachs of his kingdom belonged to the Eparchy of Žiča.

A royal chancellery document from 1223, connected to the foundation of the Cistercian abbey at Cârța around 1202, which was granted land, mentions it was built in the land of the Vlachs/Romanians. This is also the first mention of the Vlachs in Hungarian documents.

In the &quot;Diploma Andreanum&quot; issued by King Andrew II of Hungary in 1224, &quot;silva blacorum et bissenorum&quot; was given to the Saxon settlers.

The Orthodox Vlachs spread further northward along the Carpathians to the present day territory of Poland, Slovakia, and Czech Republic, and were granted autonomy under the &quot;Vlach law&quot;.

In 1230 Constantine Akropolites, in his writing about the conquests of Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Asen, notes that the &quot;Magna Vlachia&quot; is next to Albania.

Pope Gregory IX wrote several letters to the Hungarian king, in which he talks about the conversion of the Cumans who lived in the southern part of present-day Romania (Wallachia). In one of his letters he mentions the Vlachs, asking King Béla IV of Hungary to let them into his country: &quot;for the sake of God, give refuge to those poor Vlachs who tried to escape from their Cuman rulers.&quot;

In 1247, Béla IV of Hungary gives the &quot;Land of Severin&quot; to the Knights Hospitallers with two polities (&quot;kenezatus&quot; of John and Farkas), except &quot;kenezatus&quot; of voivode Litovoi which was left to the Vlachs as they held it. The land of Hateg is excepted, while the voivodate of Seneslaus the king keeps for himself.

In 1247, a Hungarian royal document allowed the nobles of Hátszeg and Máramaros to settle Vlach families on their estates.

In 1252 King Béla IV of Hungary, for his services in various foreign embassies, donates to Vince, Comes of the Szekler of Sebus, the land called Zek between the territory of the Vlachs of Kyrch, the Saxons of Barasu, and the Szeklers of Sebus, which once belonged to a Saxon estate called Fulkun, but has been uninhabited since the Mongol invasion.

In 1256 King Béla IV of Hungary, upon the complaint of Archbishop Benedict of Esztergom, confirms the right of the archdiocese to tithes from mining wages and from animal taxes collected from the Szeklers and Vlachs to the king or anyone else, among the judicial, accommodation and taxation privileges of the archdiocese, with the exception of land rents from Saxons, but also from Vlachs from everywhere and from anywhere they came.

King Ottokar II of Bohemia reports to Pope Alexander IV that about the defeated of King Béla IV of Hungary on 12 July 1260, on the border between Hungary and Austria, near the castle and town of Hemburg on the Moraua River. Among the people that fought in Béla&#x27;s army Vlachs, called &quot;Walachorum&quot;, are named.

In 1272, King Ladislaus donates the royal lands or villages of Budula and Tohou, also known as Olahteleky, to Simon&#x27;s son, Nicholas of Brașov.

From 1276 King Ladislaus allows the chapter of Alba Iulia to settle 60 Romanian households (mansiones) on the border of his estates called Fülesd and Enyed, separated from the episcopal lands, and to exempt them from all royal taxes, fiftieth and tithes.

In a grant (around 1280) Queen Helena confirmed the grant given by Stefan Vladislav to the Vranjina monastery, the Vlachs are separately mentioned, along with Arbanasi (Albanians), Latins, and Serbs.

In the 1280s, Simon of Kéza in the &quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot; mentions the Vlachs in his work three times: After the land had been conquered by King Attila, several people left Pannonia, the Vlachs (&quot;Blackis&quot;) were elected to remain in Pannonia who had been their shepherds and husbandmen. The Székelys were settled with the Vlachs (&quot;Blackis&quot;) in the border mountains, mingling with them, and adopting their alphabet. After the withdrawal of the Huns, the only people left in Pannonia were immigrants, Slavs, Greeks, Germans, Moravians, and Vlachs (&quot;Ulahis&quot;) who had been servants of Attila. Hungarian historians point out that the (&quot;Ulahis advenis&quot;) &quot;Vlach newcomer&quot;, the adjective classifying Romanians as immigrants was omitted from the Romanian translation. Some Hungarian scholars noted that Simon of Kéza used different spellings for &#x27; and &#x27;, arguing that &quot;&quot; were actually the Turkic people Bulaqs who were confused with the Vlachs. According to Polish historian Ryszard Grzesik, the Vlachs appeared in Transylvania only in the 12th century, therefore Hungarian chroniclers identified the semi-nomadic lifestyle of the Vlachs as a distinguishing characteristic. Kézai wrote that the Vlachs gave script to the Székelys, but the reality is different, because Kézai wrote about the Székelys runs, and his opinion was based on the observation that the Vlach shepherds engraved symbols while counting their sheep. Kézai confused the Székely runs with the Cyrillic script which was used by the Vlachs.

Several sources cite that the passes of the Carpathians in Transylvania were defended by the Vlachs together with Székelys and Saxons during the Second Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1285.

According to the old Russian chronicle, Ladislaus IV of Hungary asked for help from Rome and Constantinople because he feared an invasion by the Tartars. Constantinople sent an army of Vlachs from what is now Serbia, but after the victorious battle, the Vlachs refused to go home and settled in the territory of Maramures.

Also in 1285, Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos decides to move the Vlachs from Thrace to Asia-Minor, fearing their possible alliance with the Tatars. The same emperor, in 1289, confirms the rights of St. Andrew Monastery from Thessaly over the village Praktikatous or Vlachokatouna.

According to a legend, in 1290 Ladislaus the Cuman was assassinated; the new Hungarian king allegedly drove voivode Radu Negru and his people across the Carpathians, where they formed Wallachia along with its first capital Câmpulung, as a Hungarian vassal state.

In 1290 Andrew III of Hungary, in a document, grants three Transylvanian noble families the right to invite Vlachs into the country &quot;from South of the mountains&quot;.

In 1291 Andrew III of Hungary presides over a meeting of &quot;Nobles, Saxons, Szeklers, and Vlachs&quot; in Alba Iulia.

In 1292, Andrew III of Hungary allows some Hungarian nobles to invite Vlachs to the country, to their estates called &quot;Ilye&quot;, &quot;Szád&quot; and &quot;Fenes&quot;.

In 1293, Andrew III of Hungary, publishes an &quot;angry&quot; charter to the Transylvanian nobility, mentions that all the Vlachs were supposed to be settled on the royal crown&#x27;s property called &quot;Székes&quot;, not on their own estates.

In November 1293, King Andrew confirms King Ladislaus&#x27;s earlier concession to the chapter of Alba Iulia to keep the 60 households of Romanians (mansiones Olacorum) free from all taxes and services on the lands of Dalya, Ompaycza, Fylesd and Enugd, separated from the episcopal estates. These Romanians should not be forced by any royal tax collector to pay taxes, dues, or fiftieths. The charter, confirmed by a double seal, is dated by the hand of Theodore, provost of Fehérvár, vice-chancellor.

=== 14th century ===

In the list of Papal Tithes from 1332–1337 in the Kingdom of Hungary, one settlement mentioned in the source as Romanian: &quot;Căprioara&quot;. This Romanian place-name is the first recorded Romanian toponym in the Kingdom of Hungary, including Transylvania.

In 1335, a royal commissioner, on the orders of the King of Hungary, arranges for a Vlach voivode named Bogdan to move to the Kingdom of Hungary &quot;with his entire household and people&quot;. According to the charter, the settlement of the Vlach voivode and his people lasted from 1 November 1334 to 15 August 1335.

A charter, issued by Stefan Dušan, mentions that, Dobrodoliane is inhabited by Vlachs.

Morlachs are first recorded in 1344, during the struggle between the counts of the Kurjaković and Nelipić families, in the regions near Knin and Krbava, when a region called &quot;Morlacorum&quot; mentioned.

A letter from 1345 from Pope Clement VI to the Hungarian king Louis I, the phrase &quot;quod Olachi Romani&quot; appears, which can be interpreted as an expression of the papal chancellery&#x27;s conviction about the Roman origin of the Wallachians.

In 1349, another Hungarian royal charter mentions the Vlachs, allowing the Wallachian voivode to send a Vlach priest to Transylvania, thus encouraging more Vlachs to settle in the Hungarian kingdom from the south.

A Hungarian charter of 1352 states that, the lord lieutenant of Krassó County Szeri Pósa invited Vlachs to Hungary, to populate the area around the Mutnok stream.

Around 1355, Bogdan of Cuhea, former Voivode of Maramureș, but now in conflict with Louis I of Hungary, crosses the mountains with other Vlachs from Maramureș and takes over Moldavia.

In 1358, a Hungarian royal chronicler named Márk mentions Transylvania and its peoples: &quot;It is the richest part of the Hungarian Kingdom, where Hungarian and Saxon cities bloom with industry and commerce, while the fertile lands of Hungarian farmers produce good wine, fat cattle, and plenty of grain for bread. High upon the mountains Vlach herdsmen tend to their sheep, and bring down good tasting cheese to the market-places.&quot;

In 1359, the King of Hungary allowed a Vlach noble family and their household to settle in the country, first giving them 13 villages, and then 6 years later another 5 villages in the Banat.

Also in 1359, the village of Lakság &quot;near Várad&quot;, reports in a letter to the bishop of Várad that &quot;the first Vlach inhabitants have arrived&quot;.

In 1365 Balc, son of Voivode Sas of Moldavia, defeated by Bogdan, moves to the Kingdom of Hungary and is given by Louis I of Hungary the confiscated domains of his opponent.

Vlachs from the domain of Vidčeselo, between Lika and Zrmanja, are rewarded for their military support by the ban of Croatia .

In June 1366 King Louis I of Hungary grants through the Decree of Turda special privileges to the Transylvanian noblemen to take measures against malefactors belonging to any nation, especially the Vlachs.

In 1370, Louis I of Hungary decreed that only those Vlach settlers who were Catholic could receive royal grants.

The village of Wołodź in Ruthenia was first documented in 1373 as a Vlach settlement.

In a letter dates to 1374, the Cathedral chapter of Várad complains that he has only 9 Vlach villages, and asks for permission &quot;to invite more Vlachs into the country&quot; and to &quot;settle them on his estates&quot;. Also in the same letter, he asks the &quot;border nobles&quot; that &quot;if strangers come from Wallachia, do not stop them&quot;.

Papal documents from late 14th century reference the conquest of Medieș fortress &quot;from the hands of schismatic Vlachs&quot; by an unnamed King of Hungary. Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop places this event close to the Fourth Council of the Lateran

In 1374, the Cathedral chapter of Várad complained that the Vlachs living in its territory are not willing to give up their nomadic lifestyle.

In 1374, Bishop László of Várad obliges his successors not to prevent the Vlach knezes from settle further &quot;foreigners&quot; to the border areas of Bónafalva, Királybányatoplica and Keresztényfalva.

In 1376 the ban of Knin is also called &quot;comes Holachorum&quot;.

In 1381 Croatian documents from Knin mention &quot;universitas Valachorum&quot;.

In 1383 the so-called &quot;Peace convention of Christian&quot; is signed by Saxons and Romanians (Vlachs) from the area of Sibiu, aimed to ensure the peace between the two communities.

In the 14th century, royal charters from the Kingdom of Serbia included segregation policies stating that &quot;a Serb shall not marry a Vlach&quot;. However, these laws were not successful and intermarriage between Slavs, Vlachs and also Albanians did take place.

=== 15th century ===

In 1412, the captain of Zadar saved 3000 ducats to organise an army against the looting Morlachs, who lived in Ostravica, whose castle has even been taken by them. The leader of the Morlahcs was a person called Sandallor.

The biggest caravan shipment between Podvisoki in Bosnia and Republic of Ragusa was recorded on 9 August 1428, where Vlachs transported 1500 modius of salt with 600 horses.

In 1433 Vlach knezes, voievodes, and juzi from Croatia vow to respect the property right of the local St. John church.

Vlachs are mentioned in a document of Grand Duke Švitrigaila, in Kremenets, as part of the local population subject to mayor of Busk legal authority.

Nicholas of Ilok styled himself as &quot;Bosniae and Valachiae Rex&quot;.

In 1450, the Vlachs are granted a privilege in Šibenik, allowing the Vlachs to enter the town if they call themselves Croats.

Italian humanist Poggio Bracciolini claims in 1450 that Trajan left a colony among the Sarmatians which still retains much of the Latin vocabulary, and that its members say: &quot;&quot;oculum, digitum, manum, panem,&quot; and many other things, from which it appears that the Latins, who remained there as settlers, used the Latin language.&quot;

In 1453, Flavio Biondo notes that &quot;the Dacians or Vlachs claim to have Roman origins and they think this fact is a decoration in itself&quot; and that &quot;when they spoke the language of their common and simple people it scent of a grammatically incorrect peasant Latin&quot;.

King Matthias confirmed the liberties of the Vlachs in an open letter, issued March 31, 1474 in the town of Ružomberok.

Jan Długosz in his &quot;Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae&quot; wrote about Vlachs in Medieval Poland – Małopolska region, theorizing their origin as a population that came from Italy or Rome who expelled the Ruthenian (Slavic) population from the Danube settlements, and then they themselves settled in the fertile lands there.

An attested reference to Romanian comes from a Latin title of an oath made in 1485 by the Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great to the Polish King Casimir, in which it is reported that &quot;&quot;—&quot;This Inscription was translated from Valachian (Romanian) into Latin, but the King has received it written in the Ruthenian language (Slavic).&quot;

== Toponymy ==
In addition to the ethnic groups of Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians and Istro-Romanians who emerged during the Migration Period, other Vlachs could be found as far north as Poland, as far west as Moravia and Dalmatia. In search of better pasture, they were called &quot;Vlasi&quot; or &quot;Valaši&quot; by the Slavs.
States mentioned in medieval chronicles were:
* &quot;Wallachia&quot; – between the Southern Carpathians and the Danube (&quot;Ţara Românească&quot; in Romanian); Bassarab-Wallachia (Bassarab&#x27;s Wallachia and Ungro-Wallachia or Wallachia Transalpina in administrative sources;

== Shepherd culture ==
As national states appeared in the area of the former Ottoman Empire, new state borders were developed that divided the summer and winter habitats of many of the transhumance groups. During the Middle Ages, many Vlachs were shepherds who drove their flocks through the mountains of Central and Eastern Europe. Vlach shepherds may be found as far north as southern Poland (Podhale) and the eastern Czech Republic (Moravia) by following the Carpathians, the Dinaric Alps in the west, the Pindus Mountains in the south, and the Caucasus Mountains in the east. In Slovak language, the term &quot;Valasi&quot; became a synonym for apprentice shepherds.

Some researchers, such as Bogumil Hrabak and Marian Wenzel, theorized that the origins of Stećci tombstones, which appeared in medieval Bosnia between 12th and 16th century, could be attributed to Vlach burial culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina of that times.

== Legacy ==
According to Ilona Czamańska &quot;for several recent centuries the investigation of the Vlachian ethnogenesis was so much dominated by political issues that any progress in this respect was incredibly difficult&quot;. The transhumance of Vlachs, the heirs of Roman citizens, may be a key for solving the problem of ethnogenesis, but the problem is that many migrations were in multiple directions during the same time. These migrations were not just part of the history of the Balkans and the Carpathians, they exist in the Caucasus, the Adriatic islands and possibly over the entire region of the Mediterranean Sea. Because of this, our knowledge concerning primary migrations of the Vlachs and the ethnogenesis is more than modest.

Researcher have also raised a concern about cultural appropriation of Vlach heritage in the Balkans, denial of Vlach descend of various groups and personalities, and exclusion from political life.

<text>The M4 carbine (officially Carbine, Caliber 5.56 mm, M4) is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle developed in the United States during the 1980s. It is a shortened version of the M16A2 assault rifle. The M4 is extensively used by the US military, with decisions to largely replace the M16 rifle in US Army (starting 2010) and US Marine Corps (starting 2016) combat units as the primary infantry weapon and service rifle. The M4 has been adopted by over 60 countries worldwide, and has been described as &quot;one of the defining firearms of the 21st century&quot;.

Since its adoption in 1994, the M4 has undergone over 90 modifications to improve the weapon&#x27;s adaptability, ergonomics and modularity, including: the M4A1, which possesses a thicker barrel and a replacement of the burst-fire control group with a fully automatic one; the SOPMOD, an accessory kit containing optical attachments; and the underbarrel weapons such as M203 and M320 grenade launchers to the Masterkey and M26-MASS shotguns.

In April 2022, the U.S. Army selected the XM7 rifle, a variant of SIG MCX Spear, as the winner of the Next Generation Squad Weapon Program to replace the M16/M4.

==History==

=== Development of the M4 ===
Following the military adoption of the Armalite AR-15 as the M16 rifle, carbine variants were also adopted for CQC operations, the first of which was the CAR-15 family of weapons, which was used in the Vietnam War. However, these rifles had design issues, as the barrel length was halved to , which upset the ballistics, reducing its range and accuracy and leading to considerable muzzle flash and blast, meaning that a large flash suppressor had to be fitted.

In 1982, the U.S. Government requested Colt to make a carbine version of the M16A2. At the time, the Colt M16A2 was the Colt 645, also known as the M16A1E1. Later that year, the U.S. Army Armament Munitions Chemical Command helped Colt develop a new variant of the XM177E2, and the U.S. Army redesignated the XM177E2 to the XM4 Carbine, giving the name as the successor to the M3 carbine. The carbine used the same upper and lower receiver as the M16A1, and fires the M855 cartridge along with the older M193 cartridges. In 1983, the 9th Infantry Division requested a Quick Reaction Program (QRP) for a 5.56mm carbine to replace the M1 carbine and M3 submachine gun in service. The XM4 was tested by the Army&#x27;s Armament Research and Development Center (ARDC) in June 1983. Later, the gun was updated with improved furniture, and a barrel with rifling of 1 turn in . The ARDC recommended additional commonality with the M16A2 rifle, as well as lengthening the barrel to . In January 1984, the U.S. Army revised the QRP, and a month later, it formally approved development of the new carbine.

In June 1985, the Picatinny Arsenal was given a contract to produce 40 prototypes of the XM4. Initially a joint program between the Army and Marines, in 1986 the Army withdrew their funding. The XM4 was finished in 1987, and the Marines adopted 892 for that fiscal year, with the designation &quot;carbine, 5.56mm, M4&quot;. Owing to experience from the 1991 Gulf War, the Army gave Colt its first production contracts for M4 carbines in May and July 1993, and M4A1 carbines for United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) operators in February 1994.

Interest in the M4 carbine was accelerated after the Battle of Mogadishu (1993), in which Rangers complained that their M16 rifles were &quot;unwieldy&quot;, whereas members of Delta Force in the same battle, equipped with the CAR-15, had no such complaints. The M4 carbine first saw action in the hands of U.S. troops deployed to Kosovo in 1999 in support of the NATO-led Kosovo Force. It would subsequently be used heavily by U.S. forces during the war on terror, including in Operation Enduring Freedom and the Iraq War. In the Army, the M4 had largely replaced M16A2s as the primary weapon of forward deployed personnel by 2005. The M4 carbine also replaced most submachine guns and selected handguns in U.S. military service, as it fires more effective rifle ammunition that offers superior stopping power and is better able to penetrate modern body armor.
In 2007, the USMC ordered its officers (up to the rank of lieutenant colonel) and staff non-commissioned officers to carry the M4 carbine instead of the M9 handgun. This is in keeping with the Marine Corps doctrine, &quot;Every Marine a rifleman.&quot; The Marine Corps, however, chose the full-sized M16A4 over the M4 as its standard infantry rifle. United States Navy corpsmen E5 and below are also issued M4s instead of the M9. While ordinary riflemen in the Marine Corps were armed with M16A4s, M4s were fielded by troops in positions where a full-length rifle would be too bulky, including vehicle operators, fireteam and squad leaders. As of 2013, the U.S. Marine Corps had 80,000 M4 carbines in their inventory.

By July 2015, major Marine Corps commands were endorsing switching to the M4 over the M16A4 as the standard infantry rifle, just as the Army had done. This is because of the carbine&#x27;s lighter weight, compact length, and ability to address modern combat situations that happen mostly within close quarters; if a squad needs to engage at longer ranges, the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle can be used as a designated marksman rifle. Approval of the change would move the M16 to support personnel, while armories already had the 17,000 M4s in the inventory needed to outfit all infantrymen who needed one. In October 2015, Commandant Robert Neller formally approved of making the M4 carbine the primary weapon for all infantry battalions, security forces, and supporting schools in the USMC. The switch was to be completed by September 2016. In December 2017, the Marine Corps revealed a decision to equip every Marine in an infantry squad with the M27, while the M4 would be retained for leadership billets at the platoon level and above. MARSOC also retains the M4, as its shorter barrel is more suited to how they operate in confined spaces.

===Improved M4===
In 2009, the U.S. Army took complete ownership of the M4 design. This allowed companies other than Colt to compete with their own M4 designs. The Army planned on fielding the last of its M4 requirement in 2010. In October 2009, Army weapons officials proposed a series of changes to the M4 to Congress. Requested changes included an electronic round counter that records the number of shots fired, a heavier &quot;SOCOM barrel&quot;, and possibly replacing the Stoner expanding gas system with a gas piston system. The heavier &quot;SOCOM barrel&quot; was first issued to special forces operators in the early 2000s to enable greater sustained automatic fire in certain immediate-action drills, although SOCOM itself would eventually return to the standard &quot;government profile&quot; barrel in its subsequent M4 improvement programs.

The benefits of these changes, however, have come under scrutiny from both the military and civilian firearms community. According to a PDF detailing the M4 Carbine improvement plans released by PEO Soldier, the direct impingement system would be replaced only after reviews were done comparing the direct impingement system to commercial gas piston operating system to find out and use the best available operating system in the U.S. Army&#x27;s improved M4A1.

In September 2010, the Army announced it would buy 12,000 M4A1s from Colt Firearms by the end of 2010, and would order 25,000 more M4A1s by early 2011. Additionally, the service branch planned to buy 12,000 M4A1 conversion kits in early 2011 and bought 65,000 more later that year. Eventually, the Army would upgrade all of its M4s to M4A1s, although the Marine Corps would largely abstain from the effort. Conversion of M4s to the M4A1 in the Army began in 2011, as part of the Product Improvement Program, which included the conversion of 300,000 M4 carbines to the M4A1. The 101st Airborne Division began fielding newly built M4A1s in 2012, and the U.S. 1st Infantry Division became the first unit to convert their M4s to M4A1-standard in May 2014. Upgrades included the heavier SOCOM barrel to better dissipate heat from sustained automatic firing, the full-auto trigger group with a more consistent trigger pull than the burst group&#x27;s to enable better semi-automatic accuracy, and the ambidextrous selector lever for easier use with left-handed shooters. The M4-M4A1 conversion increases weapon weight from to , counting a back-up iron sight, forward pistol grip, empty magazine, and sling. Each carbine upgrade costs $240 per rifle, for a total cost of $120 million for half a million conversions. Three hundred conversions can be done per day to equip a brigade combat team per week, with all M4A1 conversions to be completed by 2019.

In addition to upgrade kits, in April 2012, the U.S. Army announced it would begin purchasing over 120,000 M4A1 carbines to start reequipping front line units from the original M4 to the new M4A1 version. The first 24,000 were to be made by Remington Arms Company. Remington was to produce the M4A1s from mid-2013 to mid-2014. After completion of that contract, it was to be between Colt and Remington to produce over 100,000 more M4A1s for the U.S. Army. Because of efforts from Colt to sue the Army to force them not to use Remington to produce M4s, the Army reworked the original solicitation for new M4A1s to avoid legal issues from Colt. On 16 November 2012, Colt&#x27;s protest of Remington receiving the M4A1 production contract was dismissed. Instead of the contract being re-awarded to Remington, the Army awarded the contract for 120,000 M4A1 carbines worth $77 million to FN Herstal on 22 February 2013. The order was expected to be completed by 2018.

=== Replacement efforts ===
Replacements for the M4 have mostly focused on two factors: improving its reliability, and its penetration. The first attempt to find a replacement for the M4 came in 1986, with the Advanced Combat Rifle program, in which the caseless Heckler &amp; Koch G11 and various flechette rifles were tested, but this was quickly dropped as these designs were mostly prototypes, which demonstrated a lack of reliability. In the 1990s, the Objective Individual Combat Weapon competition was put forth to find a replacement for the M4. Two designs were produced, both by Heckler &amp; Koch: the XM29 OICW, which incorporated a smart grenade launcher, but was canceled in 2004 as it was too heavy, and the XM8, which was canceled in 2005 as it did not offer significant enough improvements over the M4.

The Heckler &amp; Koch HK416 was introduced in 2005, incorporating the same lower receiver as the M4A1, but replacing its direct impingement system with a gas-operated rotating bolt, more comparable to that of the G36. The HK416 was adopted by the Navy SEALs, Delta Force, and other special forces. In 2010, it was adopted by the Marines as the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle. The same year, the Rangers and Navy SEALs adopted the FN SCAR, but later withdrew their purchase, as it was not a significant enough improvement over the M4A1.

==== Individual Carbine ====
The U.S. Army briefly had a tender in 2011 called the Individual Carbine, which solicited proposals for a potential M4 carbine replacement, but this was canceled in 2013 after determining that none of the entrants offered an adequate improvement over the M4.

For the Individual Carbine competition, Colt submitted their &quot;Enhanced M4&quot; design, also known as the Colt Advanced Piston Carbine (APC). The weapon has a suppression-ready fluted barrel, which is lighter and cools better than previous M4 barrels. It is claimed to have &quot;markedly better&quot; accuracy. To improve reliability, Colt used an articulating link piston (ALP), which &quot;reduces the inherent stress in the piston stroke by allowing for deflection and thermal expansion&quot;. In traditional short-stroke gas piston operating systems designed for the AR platform, the force of the piston striking the bolt carrier can push the bolt carrier downwards and into the wall of the buffer tube, leading to accelerated wear and even chipped metal. This is known as carrier tilt. The ALP allows the operating rod to wiggle to correct for the downward pressure on the bolt and transfers the force straight backwards in line with the bore and buffer assembly, eliminating the carrier tilt. This relieves stress on parts and helps to increase accuracy. The Individual Carbine competition was canceled before a winning weapon was chosen.

==== Next Generation Squad Weapon ====

After the failure of the Individual Carbine program, the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) was started in 2017. The program aimed to replace the M4 Carbine and the M249 SAW with weapons that would compensate for their perceived deficiencies when fighting at longer ranges, as well as addressing concerns about the effectiveness of traditional 5.56x45mm ammunition against troops wearing body armor in a future peer or near-peer conflict. In order to achieve these goals, all weapon submissions were to be chambered in a new 6.8x51 mm caliber. SIG Sauer, Textron Systems, FN Herstal, True Velocity (previously Lonestar Future Weapons and General Dynamics), and PCP Tactical took part in the program. Textron submitted a cased-telescoped (CT) ammunition-firing rifle for the program; FN Herstal submitted their HAMR IAR re-chambered in 6.8mm caliber; PCP Tactical submitted a modified Desert Tech MDRx; SIG Sauer submitted a redesigned MCX variant known as the MCX-SPEAR. In early 2022, the program concluded, with SIG Sauer being declared the winner. Their rifle entry was designated the XM5 (later changed to XM7 to avoid confusion with the Colt M5), and the XM250 Squad Automatic Weapon. Operational testing and fielding were scheduled for 2024.

==Design==
The M4, and its variants, is a lightweight 5.56×45mm NATO (and .223 Remington) caliber, gas-operated, magazine-fed, air-cooled selective fire AR-15-pattern firearm. Its gas operation consists of an internal piston (often incorrectly referred to as direct impingement), a rotating bolt, and bolt carrier that reciprocates into a receiver extension that is inline with the barrel. The gas system, bolt carrier, and bolt-locking design is ammunition specific, since it does not have an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the weapon to various propellant and projectile or barrel length specific pressure behavior. The receiver is made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum, while the barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and fire control group are made of steel; these components can be easily serviced and replaced by unit armories, enabling the addition of enhanced components and thus making the platform readily upgradable. The flattop upper receiver&#x27;s Picatinny rail enables the replacement of the removable carrying handle with various optics. The furniture, including the buttstock, grip, and handguard are made of reinforced plastic, although the modular nature of the weapon means that these can be swapped by the end user. The receiver extension can accommodate either a multi-position telescoping stock or a fixed A2 or LE tactical stock. The M4 is a shorter and lighter variant of the M16A2 rifle, sharing much of the same operation mechanisms and has 80% parts commonality; the chief differences are a shorter barrel of 14.5 inches rather than 20 inches as well as a shortened receiver extension and buffer.

Two fire control groups exist for the M4 family, the three-round burst for the baseline model and the fully automatic for the M4A1. Some M4A1 may also have a heavier profile barrel initially developed for SOCOM for prolonged automatic fire; models with this heavier &quot;SOCOM profile&quot; barrel use the same M4A1 designation, and existing weapons can swap to the heavier profile barrel at the unit armory level. Despite being its namesake, SOCOM itself has reverted to the original lighter &quot;government profile&quot; barrel while adopting a longer &quot;mid length&quot; gas system with its newer Upper Receiver Group-Improved (URG-I) modifications. As the modifications only affect the upper receiver assembly, rifles with the URG-I still retain the M4A1 designation.
The M4&#x27;s maneuverability makes it beneficial for non-infantry troops (vehicle crews, clerks and staff officers), as well as for close quarters battle. The M4, along with the M16A4, has mostly replaced the M16A2 in the Army and Marines. The U.S. Air Force, for example, has transitioned completely to the M4 for Security Forces squadrons, while other armed personnel retain the M16A2. The U.S. Navy uses M4A1s for Special Operations and vehicle crews. However, the M4&#x27;s shorter barrel reduces its range, with its rear iron sights integrated in the (removable) carry handle only adjustable from up to , compared to the M16A2 rear iron sights integrated in the fixed carry handle, which can reach up to .

===Accessories===
Like all the variants of the M16, the M4 and the M4A1 can be fitted with many accessories, such as slings, night-vision devices, flash suppressors, suppressors, laser sights, telescopic sights, bipods, M9 bayonet, either M203 or M320 grenade launcher, M26-MASS shotgun, forward hand grips, a detachable rail-mounted carrying handle, or anything else compatible with a MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail.

Other common accessories include the AN/PEQ-2, AN/PEQ-15 multi-mode laser, AN/PEQ-16 Mini Integrated Pointing Illumination Module (MIPIM), Trijicon TA01 and TA31 Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights (ACOG), EOTech 550 series holographic sights, and Aimpoint M68 Close Combat Optic. Visible and infrared lights of various manufacturers are commonly attached using various mounting methods. As with all versions of the M16, the M4 accepts a blank-firing attachment (BFA) for training purposes.

The M4 and the M4A1 feed from 30-round STANAG magazines. Other types of STANAG compatible magazines with different capacities may also be used. In January 2017, a USMC unit deployed with suppressors mounted to every infantry M4 service weapon. Exercises showed that having all weapons suppressed improved squad communication and surprise during engagements; disadvantages included additional heat and weight, increased maintenance, and the greater cost of equipping so many troops with the attachment. In July 2020, the Marine Corps announced it would be ordering suppressors for use by all M4 carbines used by close combat units. The Marines began to roll out suppressors for all M4/M4A1 carbines in infantry, reconnaissance and special operations units in December 2020.

==== Special Operations Peculiar Modification ====
In 1992, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) developed the Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Block I kit for the carbines used by US Special Operations Forces units operating under its command. The kit features an M4A1, a Rail Interface System (RIS) handguard developed by Knight&#x27;s Armament Company (KAC), a shortened quick-detachable M203 grenade launcher and leaf sight, a KAC sound suppressor, a KAC back-up rear sight, an Insight Technologies AN/PEQ-2A visible laser/infrared designator, along with Trijicon&#x27;s ACOG TA-01NSN model and Reflex sights, and a night vision sight, among many other accessories. This kit was designed to be configurable (modular) for various missions, and the kit is currently in service with special operations units.
In 2002, the Block II modification kit was adopted featuring two new upper receivers: the Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) with a barrel and Close Quarter Battle Receiver (CQBR) with a barrel. M4A1s fitted with the SPR were designated by the Navy as the Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle, a type of designated marksman rifle. M4A1s with the CQBR were designated the Mk 18 Mod 0. The Block II program then focused on component improvements to the M4A1, with the adoption of the heavier &quot;SOCOM profile&quot; barrel in 2004 and free-float Rail Interface System II (RIS-II) handguard from Daniel Defense in 2008. Owing to the modularity of the AR-15/M4 platform, some operators have replaced issued optics, handguards, and buttstocks with aftermarket ones.

In 2018, the Upper Receiver Group-Improved (URG-I) modification kit (unofficially the Block III) was approved for the conversion of Block I and Block II carbine&#x27;s upper receiver &quot;to an improved barrel and rail assembly..&quot; which includes a lighter free-float handguard from Geissele Automatics that incorporates the Magpul Industries M-LOK rail interface system. The URG-I also replaces the Block II&#x27;s heavier barrel with a standard &quot;government profile&quot; cold hammer forged barrel with a longer gas system.

==Variants==
The initial order of M4 carbines had a fixed carrying handle and rear sight similar to the M16A2. The flattop upper receiver with the Picatinny rail was introduced with the M4A1 variant in 1994, and all subsequent orders for all M4 variants would have a flattop upper receiver. Variants of the carbine built by different manufacturers are also in service with many other foreign special forces units, such as the Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR). While the SASR uses weapons of essentially the same pattern built by Colt for export (Colt uses different models to separate weapons for the U.S. military and those for commercial/export purposes), the British Special Air Service uses a variant on the basic theme, the Colt Canada C8SFW.

===M4 MWS (Modular Weapon System)===
Colt Model &quot;925&quot; carbines were tested and fitted with the KAC M4 RAS under the designation &quot;M4E2&quot;, but this designation appears to have been scrapped in favor of mounting this system to existing carbines without changing the designation. The U.S. Army Field Manual specifies for the Army that adding the Rail Adapter System (RAS) turns the weapon into the &quot;M4 MWS&quot; or &quot;modular weapon system&quot;.

===M4A1===

The M4A1 carbine is a fully automatic variant of the basic M4 carbine. The M4A1 was developed in May 1991 and entered service in 1994; starting in 2014 the U.S. Army began upgrading all of its existing M4s to the M4A1 standard. The M4A1 was the first M4 model with the removable carry handle. The M4A1 has a &quot;S-1-F&quot; (safe/semi-automatic/fully automatic) trigger group, while the M4 has a &quot;S-1-3&quot; (safe/semi-automatic/3-round burst) trigger group. The M4A1 is used by almost all U.S. special operation units; and is the standard service rifle across the U.S. Army (including conventional forces). It has a maximum effective range of . The fully automatic trigger gives a more consistent trigger pull, which leads to better accuracy. According to Mark Westrom, owner of ArmaLite, Inc., automatic fire is better for clearing rooms than burst fire.

A subvariant of the M4A1 uses a heavier barrel than the standard M4, as the regular M4 barrel, which can fire 6,000 rounds before requiring inspection for possible replacement, was not sufficient for the higher consumption of ammunition by SOCOM operators. The redesigned barrel, colloquially referred to as the &quot;SOCOM barrel&quot;, has an increased diameter in the area between the receiver and front sight. Despite the different barrel profile, this subvariant did not receive a new designation, and was still referred to as the M4A1. Ironically, SOCOM itself would dispense with its namesake heavier barrel and return to the original &quot;government profile&quot; with its Upper Receiver Group-Improved (URG-I) program&#x27;s mid-length gassed, cold hammer forged barrels.

===Mk 18 CQBR===

The &quot;Close Quarters Battle Receiver&quot; (CQBR) was originally a Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) program item that would increase the close quarters maneuverability of the M4A1 by mating the lower receiver with a barreled upper receiver; with the CQBR installed, the weapon would then be classified as the &quot;Mk. 18 CQBR&quot;. The Mk. 18 CQBR may be issued as a standalone complete weapon system to SOCOM personnel, or as a separate upper receiver for their M4A1 to enable greater mission flexibility.

===Mk 12 SPR===

The SOPMOD program also introduced the &quot;Special Purpose Receiver&quot; (SPR), a barreled upper receiver that would be mated to an M4A1 lower receiver to allow the weapon to serve as a designated marksman rifle (DMR). Although originally intended as an upper receiver kit for the M4A1 like the CQBR, the SPR would eventually be issued as a standalone complete rifle designated the &quot;Mk. 12 Special Purpose Rifle&quot;, with some assembled from M4A1 lower receivers.

===SOPMOD Block II===
The &quot;SOPMOD Block II&quot; is a more radical modification kit for the baseline M4A1 that can be fitted at first-echelon unit maintenance level. Components of the Block II were phased in gradually, but the most distinctive feature is the free-floated Daniel Defense Rail Interface System II (RIS II), first issued in 2008. The RIS II is available in 9.5 inches for the Mk 18 Mod 1 or 12.5 inches for the M4A1. Other components of the Block II include the L3 Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Laser (ATPIAL), or the AN/PEQ-15 as well as the LA5 high-power variants, and the ELCAN SpecterDR 1-4 optic.

===Upper Receiver Group-Improved (URG-I)===
The &quot;Upper Receiver Group-Improved&quot; (URG-I) is a U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) program to further improve the durability and reliability of the SOPMOD Block II by introducing additional component improvements. First fielded in 2018, the main improvements are the lighter Geissele Mark 16 free-float rail that incorporates M-LOK as the mounting method and a Daniel Defense cold hammer-forged barrel that returns to the lighter &quot;government&quot; profile contour as well as a mid-length gas system. Although initially an Army program, the URG-I has seen use by other components of SOCOM as well.

===GAU-5/A===
The &quot;GAU-5/A&quot; Aircrew Self Defense Weapon (ASDW) is an Air Force modified M4 with a detachable barrel and handguard assembly, folding pistol grip, and fold-down iron sights to enable compact packaging. This weapon is stowed in ejection seats of tactical aircraft and is intended to allow aircrew who egress in hostile environments to better defend themselves until rescue than existing handguns. The weapons entered service in 2018. Confusingly, this weapon shares the same designation as the Air Force CAR-15 variant in service since 1966.

==Performance==

The M4 carbine has been used for close quarters operations where the M16 would be too long and bulky to use effectively. It has been a compact, light, customizable, and accurate weapon. Like other firearms, failure to properly maintain the M4 can result in malfunctions. This became apparent as it saw continued use in the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan. Despite this, in post-combat surveys, 94% of soldiers rated the M4 as an effective weapons system.

===2006 CNA report===
In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) released a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the previous 12 months. Only troops who fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 917 troops were armed with M4 Carbines, making up 35% of the survey. 89% of M4 users reported they were satisfied with the weapon. 90% were satisfied with handling qualities such as handguards, size, and weight. M4 users had the highest levels of satisfaction with weapon performance, including 94% with accuracy, 92% with range, and 93% with rate of fire. Only 19% of M4 users reported a stoppage, and 82% of those that experienced a stoppage said it had little impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. The lowest rated weapon was the M9, and the M249 had the highest rate of stoppages. 53% of the M4 users never experienced failures of their magazines to feed. 81% did not need their rifles repaired while in theater. 80% were confident in the M4&#x27;s reliability, defined as confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 83% were confident in its durability, defined as confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance. 54% of M4 users offered recommendations for improvements. 20% of requests were for greater bullet lethality, and 10% were for better quality magazines, as well as other minor recommendations. Only 75% of M16 users were satisfied with it, and some expressed their desire to be issued the M4. Some issues from this report have been addressed with the issuing of the improved STANAG magazine in March 2009, and the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round in June 2010.

===2007 dust test===
In summer and fall 2007, the Army tested the M4 against three other carbines in &quot;sandstorm conditions&quot; at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland: the Heckler &amp; Koch XM8, Fabrique Nationale de Herstal SOF Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) and the Heckler &amp; Koch HK416. Ten of each type of rifle were used to fire 6,000 rounds each, for a total of 60,000 rounds per rifle type. The M4 suffered far more stoppages than its competitors: 882 stoppages, 19 requiring an armorer to fix. The XM8 had the fewest stoppages, 116 minor stoppages and 11 major ones, followed by the FN SCAR with 226 stoppages and the HK416 with 233.

Despite 863 minor stoppages—termed &quot;class one&quot; stoppages, which require 10 seconds or less to clear, or &quot;class two&quot; stoppages, which require more than ten seconds to clear—the M4 functioned well, with over 98% of the 60,000 total rounds firing without a problem. The Army said it planned to improve the M4 with a new cold-hammer-forged barrel to give longer life and more reliable magazines to reduce the stoppages. Magazine failures caused 239 of the M4&#x27;s failures. Army officials said the new magazines could be combat-ready by spring if testing went well. The Army began issuing an improved STANAG magazine in March 2009.

According to the Army, the M4 only suffered 296 stoppages and said that the high number reported could be attributed to discrepancies in the scoring process. The Army testing command stated that, if the number of stoppages caused by a broken part met some threshold, they would be eliminated from the final report pending redesign of the part. The methodology of the test has been debated, as many of the M4s in the test had already seen use, whereas the other rifles were brand new, and that the wide variance in results between summer and fall showed that the test was not accurate, as it was not repeatable with consistent results. Furthermore, the trial M4s had burst-mode fire groups, which are more complicated and prone to failure than the fully automatic fire groups the other manufacturers presented for testing.

There were three extreme dust tests performed in 2007. The second test results showed a large difference from the last test with the M4 having 148 class 1 stoppages caused by rifle malfunctions and 148 class 1 stoppages caused by magazine stoppages. The full-size M16 rifle had 61 stoppages during the same extreme dust test.

===Reliability===
In early 2010, two journalists from the &quot;New York Times&quot; spent three months with soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan. While there, they questioned around 100 infantrymen about the reliability of their M4 carbines, as well as the M16 rifle. Troops did not report reliability problems with their rifles. While only 100 troops were asked, they fought at least a dozen intense engagements in Helmand Province, where the ground is covered in fine powdered sand (called &quot;moon dust&quot; by troops) that can stick to firearms. Weapons were often dusty, wet, and covered in mud. Intense firefights lasted hours with several magazines being expended. Only one soldier reported a jam when his M16 was covered in mud after climbing out of a canal. The weapon was cleared and resumed firing with the next chambered round. Furthermore, a Marine chief warrant officer reported that there were no issues with his battalion&#x27;s 700 M4s and 350 M16s.

The reliability of the M4 has increased as the design was upgraded. In 1990, the M4 was required to fire 600 mean rounds between stoppages using M855 ammunition. In 2013, the current M4A1 version can fire 1,691 mean rounds between stoppages using M855A1 ammunition. During the 2009 Marine Corps Infantry Automatic Rifle testing, the Colt IAR displayed a MRBS of CLASS I/II Stoppages of 952 rounds, with a MRBEFF (Mean Rounds Between Essential Function Failure) of Class III Stoppages of 60,000 rounds.

===Gas piston===
An array of firearms accessory makers have offered gas piston conversion kits for the M4. The claimed benefits include less needed lubrication for the bolt carrier group to run reliably and reduced fouling. The argument against it is increased weight and reduced accuracy. The Enhanced M4 uses an articulating link piston operating system. Complicating the Army search for higher reliability in the M4 is a number of observations of M4 gas piston alternatives that suffer unintended design problems. The first is that many of the gas piston modifications for the M4 isolate the piston so that piston jams or related malfunction require the entire weapon be disassembled, such disassembly cannot be performed by the end-user and requires a qualified armorer to perform out of field, whereas almost any malfunction with the direct-impingement system can be fixed by the end-user in field. The second is that gas piston alternatives use an off-axis operation of the piston that can introduce carrier tilt, whereby the bolt carrier fails to enter the buffer tube at a straight angle, resulting in part wearing. This can also tilt the bolt during extraction, leading to increased bolt lug failures. The third is that the use of a sound suppressor results in hot gases entering the chamber, regardless of a direct-gas impingement or gas piston design choice. The gas piston system may also cause the firearm to become proprietary to the manufacturer, making modifications and changes with parts from other manufacturers difficult.

=== Accuracy ===
In a study conducted by the Army Marksmanship Unit, they found that at a distance of , the M16 achieved a grouping, and the M4 achieved a grouping, which dropped to and respectively when using match grade ammunition. As the average male torso is wide, author Chris McNab concluded that this meant the M4 can be consistently accurate up to 300 yards, and noted that the frequent usage of optical attachments meant it could be accurate to higher ranges.

=== ArmWest, LLC modified M4 ===
In 2014, American firearms designer Jim Sullivan provided a video interview regarding his contributions to the M16 and M4 family of rifles while working for Armalite. A noted critic of the M4, he illustrates the deficiencies found in the rifle in its current configuration. In the video, he demonstrates his &quot;ArmWest, LLC modified M4&quot;, with enhancements he believes necessary to rectify the issues with the weapon. Proprietary issues aside, the weapon is said to borrow features in his prior development, the Ultimax. Sullivan has stated (without exact details as to how) the weapon can fire from the closed bolt in semi-automatic and switch to open bolt when firing in fully automatic, improving accuracy. The weight of the cyclic components of the gun has been doubled (while retaining the weapon&#x27;s weight at less than 8 pounds). Compared to the standard M4, which in automatic fires 700–950 rounds a minute, the rate of fire of the ArmWest, LLC M4 is heavily reduced both to save ammunition and reduce barrel wear. The reduced rate also renders the weapon more controllable and accurate in automatic firing.

==Trademark issues==
The M4 was developed and produced for the United States government by Colt Firearms, which had an exclusive contract to produce the M4 family of weapons through 2011. However, a number of other manufacturers offer M4-like firearms. Colt previously held a U.S. trademark on the term &quot;M4&quot;. Many manufacturers offer production firearms that are essentially identical to a military M4, but with a barrel. The Bushmaster M4 Type Carbine is a popular example. Civilian models are sometimes colloquially referred to as &quot;M4gery&quot; ( , a portmanteau of &quot;M4&quot; and &quot;forgery.&quot;) Colt had maintained that it retained sole rights to the M4 name and design, while other manufacturers had long maintained that Colt had been overstating its rights, and that &quot;M4&quot; had now become a generic term for a shortened AR-15.

In April 2004, Colt filed a lawsuit against Heckler &amp; Koch and Bushmaster Firearms, claiming acts of trademark infringement, trade dress infringement, trademark dilution, false designation of origin, false advertising, patent infringement, unfair competition, and deceptive trade practices. Heckler &amp; Koch later settled out of court, changing one product&#x27;s name from &quot;HK M4&quot; to &quot;HK416&quot;. However, on December 8, 2005, a district court judge in Maine granted a summary judgment in favor of Bushmaster Firearms, dismissing all of Colt&#x27;s claims except for false advertising. On the latter claim, Colt could not recover monetary damages. The court also ruled that &quot;M4&quot; was now a generic name and that Colt&#x27;s trademark should be revoked.

<text>In number theory, a Woodall number (&quot;W&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is any natural number of the form

:formula_1

for some natural number &quot;n&quot;. The first few Woodall numbers are:

:1, 7, 23, 63, 159, 383, 895, … .

==History==
Woodall numbers were first studied by Allan J. C. Cunningham and H. J. Woodall in 1917, inspired by James Cullen&#x27;s earlier study of the similarly defined Cullen numbers.

==Woodall primes==

Woodall numbers that are also prime numbers are called Woodall primes; the first few exponents &quot;n&quot; for which the corresponding Woodall numbers &quot;W&quot;&quot;n&quot; are prime are 2, 3, 6, 30, 75, 81, 115, 123, 249, 362, 384, ... ; the Woodall primes themselves begin with 7, 23, 383, 32212254719, ... .

In 1976 Christopher Hooley showed that almost all Cullen numbers are composite. In October 1995, Wilfred Keller published a paper discussing several new Cullen primes and the efforts made to factorise other Cullen and Woodall numbers. Included in that paper is a personal communication to Keller from Hiromi Suyama, asserting that Hooley&#x27;s method can be reformulated to show that it works for any sequence of numbers , where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are integers, and in particular, that almost all Woodall numbers are composite. It is an open problem whether there are infinitely many Woodall primes. , the largest known Woodall prime is 17016602 × 217016602 − 1. It has 5,122,515 digits and was found by Diego Bertolotti in March 2018 in the distributed computing project PrimeGrid.

==Restrictions==
Starting with &quot;W&quot;4 = 63 and &quot;W&quot;5 = 159, every sixth Woodall number is divisible by 3; thus, in order for &quot;W&quot;&quot;n&quot; to be prime, the index &quot;n&quot; cannot be congruent to 4 or 5 (modulo 6). Also, for a positive integer &quot;m&quot;, the Woodall number &quot;W&quot;2&quot;m&quot; may be prime only if 2&quot;m&quot; + &quot;m&quot; is prime. As of January 2019, the only known primes that are both Woodall primes and Mersenne primes are &quot;W&quot;2 = &quot;M&quot;3 = 7, and &quot;W&quot;512 = &quot;M&quot;521.

==Divisibility properties==
Like Cullen numbers, Woodall numbers have many divisibility properties. For example, if &quot;p&quot; is a prime number, then &quot;p&quot; divides

:&quot;W&quot;(&quot;p&quot; + 1) / 2 if the Jacobi symbol formula_2 is +1 and

:&quot;W&quot;(3&quot;p&quot; − 1) / 2 if the Jacobi symbol formula_2 is −1.

==Generalization==
A generalized Woodall number base &quot;b&quot; is defined to be a number of the form &quot;n&quot; × &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1, where &quot;n&quot; + 2 &gt; &quot;b&quot;; if a prime can be written in this form, it is then called a generalized Woodall prime.

The smallest value of &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;n&quot; × &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 is prime for &quot;b&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... are
:3, 2, 1, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 10, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 167, 2, 1, 12, 1, 2, 2, 29028, 1, 2, 3, 10, 2, 26850, 1, 8, 1, 42, 2, 6, 2, 24, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 140, 1, 2, 2, 22, 2, 8, 1, 2064, 2, 468, 6, 2, 1, 362, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 26, 1, 2, 3, 20, 1, 2, 1, 28, 2, 38, 5, 3024, 1, 2, 81, 858, 1, 2, 3, 2, 8, 60, 1, 2, 2, 10, 5, 2, 7, 182, 1, 17782, 3, ... 

, the largest known generalized Woodall prime with base greater than 2 is 2740879 × 322740879 − 1.

<text>In mathematics, a Riesel number is an odd natural number &quot;k&quot; for which formula_1 is composite for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot; . In other words, when &quot;k&quot; is a Riesel number, all members of the following set are composite:

:formula_2

If the form is instead formula_3, then &quot;k&quot; is a Sierpiński number.

== Riesel problem ==

In 1956, Hans Riesel showed that there are an infinite number of integers &quot;k&quot; such that formula_1 is not prime for any integer &quot;n&quot;. He showed that the number 509203 has this property, as does 509203 plus any positive integer multiple of 11184810. The Riesel problem consists in determining the smallest Riesel number. Because no covering set has been found for any &quot;k&quot; less than 509203, it is conjectured to be the smallest Riesel number.

To check if there are &quot;k&quot; &lt; 509203, the Riesel Sieve project (analogous to Seventeen or Bust for Sierpiński numbers) started with 101 candidates &quot;k&quot;. As of December 2022, 57 of these &quot;k&quot; had been eliminated by Riesel Sieve, PrimeGrid, or outside persons. The remaining 42 values of &quot;k&quot; that have yielded only composite numbers for all values of &quot;n&quot; so far tested are

:23669, 31859, 38473, 46663, 67117, 74699, 81041, 107347, 121889, 129007, 143047, 161669, 206231, 215443, 226153, 234343, 245561, 250027, 315929, 319511, 324011, 325123, 327671, 336839, 342847, 344759, 362609, 363343, 364903, 365159, 368411, 371893, 384539, 386801, 397027, 409753, 444637, 470173, 474491, 477583, 485557, 494743.

The most recent elimination was in April 2023, when 97139 × 218397548 − 1 was found to be prime by Ryan Propper. This number is 5,538,219 digits long.

As of January 2023, PrimeGrid has searched the remaining candidates up to &quot;n&quot; = 14,900,000.

== Known Riesel numbers ==
The sequence of currently &quot;known&quot; Riesel numbers begins with:
:509203, 762701, 777149, 790841, 992077, 1106681, 1247173, 1254341, 1330207, 1330319, 1715053, 1730653, 1730681, 1744117, 1830187, 1976473, 2136283, 2251349, 2313487, 2344211, 2554843, 2924861, ... 

== Covering set ==
A number can be shown to be a Riesel number by exhibiting a &quot;covering set&quot;: a set of prime numbers that will divide any member of the sequence, so called because it is said to &quot;cover&quot; that sequence. The only proven Riesel numbers below one million have covering sets as follows:
* formula_5 has covering set {3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}
* formula_6 has covering set {3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}
* formula_7 has covering set {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73}
* formula_8 has covering set {3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73}
* formula_9 has covering set {3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}.

== The smallest &quot;n&quot; for which &quot;k&quot; · 2&quot;n&quot; − 1 is prime ==

Here is a sequence formula_10 for &quot;k&quot; = 1, 2, ... It is defined as follows: formula_10 is the smallest &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0 such that formula_12 is prime, or −1 if no such prime exists.
:2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 0, 7, 0, 1, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 12, 0, 3, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 5, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 7, 0, 1, ... . The first unknown &quot;n&quot; is for that &quot;k&quot; = 23669.

Related sequences are (not allowing &quot;n&quot; = 0), for odd &quot;k&quot;s, see or (not allowing &quot;n&quot; = 0).

==Simultaneously Riesel and Sierpiński==
A number both Riesel and Sierpiński is a Brier number. The five smallest known examples (and note that some might be smaller, i.e. that the sequence might not be comprehensive) are: 3316923598096294713661, 10439679896374780276373, 11615103277955704975673, 12607110588854501953787, 17855036657007596110949, ... ().

==The dual Riesel problem==
The dual Riesel numbers are defined as the odd natural numbers &quot;k&quot; such that |2&quot;n&quot; - &quot;k&quot;| is composite for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;. There is a conjecture that the set of this numbers is the same as the set of Riesel numbers. For example, |2&quot;n&quot; - 509203| is composite for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;, and 509203 is conjectured to be the smallest dual Riesel number.

The smallest &quot;n&quot; which 2&quot;n&quot; - &quot;k&quot; is prime are (for odd &quot;k&quot;s, and this sequence requires that 2&quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;k&quot;)
:2, 3, 3, 39, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 7, 6, 6, 11, 7, 6, 29, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 7, 7, 10, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 7, 7, 8, 7, 8, 10, 7, 7, 26, 9, 7, 8, 7, 7, 10, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 47, 8, 14, 9, 11, 10, 9, 10, 8, 9, 8, 8, ... 

The odd &quot;k&quot;s which &quot;k&quot; - 2&quot;n&quot; are all composite for all 2&quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot; (the de Polignac numbers) are
:1, 127, 149, 251, 331, 337, 373, 509, 599, 701, 757, 809, 877, 905, 907, 959, 977, 997, 1019, 1087, 1199, 1207, 1211, 1243, 1259, 1271, 1477, ... 

The unknown values of &quot;k&quot;s are (for which 2&quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;k&quot;)
:1871, 2293, 25229, 31511, 36971, 47107, 48959, 50171, 56351, 63431, 69427, 75989, 81253, 83381, 84491, ...

==Riesel number base &quot;b&quot;==
One can generalize the Riesel problem to an integer base &quot;b&quot; ≥ 2. A Riesel number base &quot;b&quot; is a positive integer &quot;k&quot; such that gcd(&quot;k&quot; − 1, &quot;b&quot; − 1) = 1. (if gcd(&quot;k&quot; − 1, &quot;b&quot; − 1) &gt; 1, then gcd(&quot;k&quot; − 1, &quot;b&quot; − 1) is a trivial factor of &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 (Definition of trivial factors for the conjectures: Each and every &quot;n&quot;-value has the same factor)) For every integer &quot;b&quot; ≥ 2, there are infinitely many Riesel numbers base &quot;b&quot;.

Example 1: All numbers congruent to 84687 mod 10124569 and not congruent to 1 mod 5 are Riesel numbers base 6, because of the covering set {7, 13, 31, 37, 97}. Besides, these &quot;k&quot; are not trivial since gcd(&quot;k&quot; + 1, 6 − 1) = 1 for these &quot;k&quot;. (The Riesel base 6 conjecture is not proven, it has 3 remaining &quot;k&quot;, namely 1597, 9582 and 57492)

Example 2: 6 is a Riesel number to all bases &quot;b&quot; congruent to 34 mod 35, because if &quot;b&quot; is congruent to 34 mod 35, then 6×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 is divisible by 5 for all even &quot;n&quot; and divisible by 7 for all odd &quot;n&quot;. Besides, 6 is not a trivial &quot;k&quot; in these bases &quot;b&quot; since gcd(6 − 1, &quot;b&quot; − 1) = 1 for these bases &quot;b&quot;.

Example 3: All squares &quot;k&quot; congruent to 12 mod 13 and not congruent to 1 mod 11 are Riesel numbers base 12, since for all such &quot;k&quot;, &quot;k&quot;×12&quot;n&quot; − 1 has algebraic factors for all even &quot;n&quot; and divisible by 13 for all odd &quot;n&quot;. Besides, these &quot;k&quot; are not trivial since gcd(&quot;k&quot; + 1, 12 − 1) = 1 for these &quot;k&quot;. (The Riesel base 12 conjecture is proven)

Example 4: If &quot;k&quot; is between a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 11, then &quot;k&quot;×109&quot;n&quot; − 1 is divisible by either 5 or 11 for all positive integers &quot;n&quot;. The first few such &quot;k&quot; are 21, 34, 76, 89, 131, 144, ... However, all these &quot;k&quot; &lt; 144 are also trivial &quot;k&quot; (i. e. gcd(&quot;k&quot; − 1, 109 − 1) is not 1). Thus, the smallest Riesel number base 109 is 144. (The Riesel base 109 conjecture is not proven, it has one remaining &quot;k&quot;, namely 84)

Example 5: If &quot;k&quot; is square, then &quot;k&quot;×49&quot;n&quot; − 1 has algebraic factors for all positive integers &quot;n&quot;. The first few positive squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ... However, all these &quot;k&quot; &lt; 36 are also trivial &quot;k&quot; (i. e. gcd(&quot;k&quot; − 1, 49 − 1) is not 1). Thus, the smallest Riesel number base 49 is 36. (The Riesel base 49 conjecture is proven)

We want to find and proof the smallest Riesel number base &quot;b&quot; for every integer &quot;b&quot; ≥ 2. It is a conjecture that if &quot;k&quot; is a Riesel number base &quot;b&quot;, then at least one of the three conditions holds:
# All numbers of the form &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 have a factor in some covering set. (For example, &quot;b&quot; = 22, &quot;k&quot; = 4461, then all numbers of the form &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 have a factor in the covering set: {5, 23, 97})
# &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 has algebraic factors. (For example, &quot;b&quot; = 9, &quot;k&quot; = 4, then &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 can be factored to (2×3&quot;n&quot; − 1) × (2×3&quot;n&quot; + 1))
# For some &quot;n&quot;, numbers of the form &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 have a factor in some covering set; and for all other &quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 has algebraic factors. (For example, &quot;b&quot; = 19, &quot;k&quot; = 144, then if &quot;n&quot; is odd, then &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 is divisible by 5, if &quot;n&quot; is even, then &quot;k&quot;×&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 can be factored to (12×19&quot;n&quot;/2 − 1) × (12×19&quot;n&quot;/2 + 1))

In the following list, we only consider those positive integers &quot;k&quot; such that gcd(&quot;k&quot; − 1, &quot;b&quot; − 1) = 1, and all integer &quot;n&quot; must be ≥ 1.

Note: &quot;k&quot;-values that are a multiple of &quot;b&quot; and where &quot;k&quot;−1 is not prime are included in the conjectures (and included in the remaining &quot;k&quot; with color if no primes are known for these &quot;k&quot;-values) but excluded from testing (Thus, never be the &quot;k&quot; of &quot;largest 5 primes found&quot;), since such &quot;k&quot;-values will have the same prime as &quot;k&quot; / &quot;b&quot;.

Conjectured smallest Riesel number base &quot;n&quot; are (start with &quot;n&quot; = 2)

<doc id="321970" wikidata="Q194203" url="?curid=321970" title="Arrondissements of France">
<text>An arrondissement () is the third level of administrative division in France generally corresponding to the territory overseen by a subprefect. As of 2023, the 101 French departments are divided into 333 arrondissements (including 13 overseas).

The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. When an arrondissement contains the prefecture (capital) of the department, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes.

The term arrondissement can be roughly translated into English as district.

Some municipalities in Quebec are divided into arrondissements, reflecting the province’s historical link to New France.

==Role and administration==
The administration of an arrondissement is assigned to a subprefect () who assists the departmental prefect ().

Unlike French regions, departments and communes, arrondissements do not have the status of legal entity in public law. In addition, unlike those other administrative divisions, they are not run by elected officials, but by political appointees, officials appointed by the French president.

==History==
The concept of arrondissements was proposed several times as an administrative reform during the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, notably by the &quot;intendant&quot; of the généralité of Brittany, Caze de La Bove, in his &quot;Mémoire concernant les subdélégués de l&#x27;intendance de Bretagne&quot; in 1775.

The arrondissements were created after the French Revolution by the &quot;Loi du 28 pluviôse&quot; in the year VIII of the Republican Calendar (17 February 1800) and replaced &quot;districts&quot;. In certain periods in French history, they have served a role in legislative elections, especially during the Third Republic. In 1926, 106 arrondissements were suppressed by the government. While it claimed it was to achieve fiscal savings, some political analysts considered the results electoral manipulation. Some of these suppressed arrondissements were restored in 1942.

===Changes===
The most recent creations and disestablishments of arrondissements are listed in the table below.

==Statistics==
Most departments have three or four arrondissements. The departments of Paris and of the Territoire de Belfort have only one, while the department of Pas-de-Calais has seven. Mayotte has none.
