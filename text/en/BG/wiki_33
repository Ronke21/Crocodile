<text>Philip Aloysius Hart (December 10, 1912December 26, 1976) was an American lawyer and politician. A Democrat, he served as a United States Senator from Michigan from 1959 until his death from cancer in Washington, D.C. in 1976. He was known as the &quot;Conscience of the Senate&quot;. The Hart Senate Office Building is named in his honor.

==Early life and family==
The grandson of Irish immigrants, Philip Hart was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to Philip Aloysius and Ann (née Clyde) Hart. His father was a banker who served as president of the Bryn Mawr Trust Company. He received his early education at Waldron Academy, and then attended West Philadelphia Catholic High School.

Hart studied at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he was the student body president and an award-winning debater. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree &quot;cum laude&quot; from Georgetown in 1934. In 1937, he received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Michigan Law School at Ann Arbor.

In June 1943, Hart married Jane &quot;Janey&quot; Briggs, the daughter of Walter and Jane Cameron Briggs. Her father was by then a philanthropist and had owned the Detroit Tigers. Jane was an aviator who was the first female helicopter pilot in Michigan. She later qualified in the 1960s as one of the Mercury 13 group. The couple met through her brother, who was Hart&#x27;s roommate at Georgetown. They have four surviving sons and four daughters. Hart&#x27;s namesake, Philip Jr., died as a toddler. He was buried in a family plot, followed decades later by his father nearby.

==Early career==
Hart was admitted to the State Bar of Michigan in 1938 and became an associate in the Detroit firm of Beaumont, Smith &amp; Harris. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army as a lieutenant colonel with the 4th Infantry Division (1941–1946). He was wounded during the D-Day invasion of Normandy on Utah Beach when shrapnel from an exploding artillery shell damaged the inside of his right arm. Following the war, he returned to Michigan and recovered at the Percy Jones Army Hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan. There he became acquainted with fellow veterans Bob Dole and Daniel Inouye, both also future U.S. senators. He was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal with clusters, Arrowhead device, Purple Heart, and Croix de guerre.

In 1946, Hart returned to Detroit and entered the general law practice of Monaghan, Hart &amp; Crawmer. He became politically active in the Democratic Party and, from 1949 to 1951, he served as Michigan&#x27;s Corporation Securities Commissioner, a political appointee position. His duties included the approving of stock issues of corporations in the state, licensing real estate brokers and builders, and collecting real estate taxes. In 1951 Hart was appointed as state director of the Office of Price Stabilization, serving for a year. For his work in that office, he was named Outstanding Federal Administrator of the Year in 1952 by the Federal Business Association.

In 1952, he was appointed as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, serving for one year. He next served from 1953 to 1954 as legal adviser to Governor G. Mennen Williams, a former law school classmate.

In 1954, Hart ran for electoral office, elected as the 51st lieutenant governor of Michigan, on a ticket with Governor Williams. He served two terms, until 1959. His re-election in 1956 made him the first Democrat in Michigan to serve two terms as lieutenant governor.

==U.S. Senate==

Hart was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate in the Democratic wave election of 1958, defeating one-term incumbent Republican Charles E. Potter by a 54% to 46% margin. He was reelected by overwhelming margins in 1964 and 1970. (His 1970 opponent was former Michigan First Lady Lenore Romney.) Some conservatives in Michigan attempted to recall Hart from office for his stands on gun control and busing for racial integration, with bumper stickers reading &quot;Recall cures Hart attacks,&quot; but the US Constitution does not authorize the recall of elected federal officials, and Hart was strongly re-elected by supporters.

Hart was the chief Senate sponsor of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, also known as the Hart–Celler Act, which ended the quotas that restricted immigration from most of the world since 1924.

Hart died in office. He had announced his intention not to run for re-election in June 1976 and was diagnosed with cancer a month later. The same year, the Senate voted to name its new Senate office building after him, the Hart Senate Office Building. It would have been the first federal government building named after someone still living. The vote was 99–0, with Hart abstaining. He died of melanoma a few days later, just before his term would have expired, and he would have retired. Donald W. Riegle, Jr., who had just been elected to the seat for the next term, was named to fill Hart&#x27;s seat for the remaining days of the congressional session.

Hart is interred in St. Anne&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery on Mackinac Island in a family plot near his namesake son, who died as a toddler.

<text>Daniel Richard Hollie (born October 3, 1977) is an American retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenures in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) between 2003 and 2007 under the ring name Danny Basham and in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling under the ring name Damaja in 2007.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Ohio Valley Wrestling (1998–2003) ===
Hollie made his wrestling debut in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), as the Damaja. On January 6, 1999, he and David C. were awarded the OVW Tag Title when Nick Dinsmore no-showed and Rob Conway was counted out. He was also a three-time OVW Champion, defeating the likes of Dinsmore, Flash Flanagan, and Nova.

In 2000 Danny Hollie made a few appearances on &quot;WWF Jakked&quot; and in dark matches under the ring name Danny Holliday. In 2003, he was given the managerial services of &quot;Tough Enough&quot; II winner Shaniqua.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2007)===

In late 2002 through early 2003 Hollie worked dark matches before the &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; tapings under his OVW gimmick and ring name, The Damaja. On May 29, 2003, Danny made his WWE television debut (as Danny Basham), teaming with Doug Basham to form the heel tag team, the Basham Brothers. The Bashams were later aligned with the valet, Shaniqua. As well as being portrayed with a bondage-based S&amp;M gimmick, the &quot;brothers&quot; often switched places mid-match, so the &quot;fresher&quot; wrestler was always in the ring. In almost all cases, the referee acted oblivious to the switch, despite their easily differentiated faces and they won their first WWE Tag Team Championship from Los Guerreros on the October 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, after they switched places behind the referee&#x27;s back, and hit Eddie Guerrero with a foreign object. The team lost the titles in February 2004 to Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty. The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua faced Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi at No Way Out in a handicapped match for the tag team titles but lost when Shaniqua was pinned. Right after this match, Shaniqua was sent to OVW for training and was eventually released.
The Basham Brothers joined John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL)&#x27;s cabinet stable on November 25, 2004. They were known as JBL&#x27;s Co-Secretaries of Defense. The Bashams once again won the WWE Tag Team Championship by defeating four other teams including Rey Mysterio and Rob Van Dam, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak, and Eddie Guerrero and Booker T on January 13, 2005, in a four team elimination match by last eliminating Mysterio and Van Dam. The Basham Brothers lost the titles to Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero at No Way Out on February 20, 2005. From here on, The Bashams either acted as jobbers on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; or defeated any team that came in their path on &quot;Velocity&quot;. The Basham Brothers quit JBL&#x27;s Cabinet on the June 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, claiming that they were tired of being &quot;JBL&#x27;s crash test dummies&quot; and not getting enough respect.

On June 30, 2005, Basham became one of the last-minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft, which saw him leave &quot;SmackDown!&quot; for &quot;Raw&quot;. This marked the end of the partnership with his &quot;twin brother,&quot; who remained on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. On the July 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Basham made his first appearance on the Raw brand as one of Chris Jericho&#x27;s hand picked lumberjacks in the Lumberjack match between John Cena and Gene Snitsky.

In August 2005, Hollie worked dark matches during &quot;Raw&quot; tapings under his former gimmick, The Damaja and made his televised debut on the September 11 episode of &quot;WWE Heat&quot; (as Danny Basham) under his Damaja gimmick, only more gothic and Raven-like. Danny came out with new music, black face paint, and ring attire consisting of black boots and baggy black pants with hooks and chains on them. Hollie soon disappeared from television to grow his hair but continued to work squash matches under this gimmick very sporadically at house shows or in dark matches over the next several months before completely disappearing from in-ring competition in 2006 before signing a new deal with WWE in April of that year.
Danny and Doug reunited in WWE&#x27;s revived ECW brand during July 2006 at several house shows. They re-debuted on television on the July 18 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, as personal security guards under helmets. However, when Danny was injured with a torn biceps, he was later replaced by Derek Neikirk, who continued Danny&#x27;s role as the second masked enforcer. Danny&#x27;s final WWE appearance was on the December 12 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, where he and Doug were quickly defeated by Bobby Lashley. Hollie was released by WWE on January 18, 2007.

On November 18, 2006, Hollie made a surprising return when OVW owner Danny Davis introduced Danny Basham as the &quot;OVW TroubleShooter&quot; (similar to a General Manager), granting him the power to direct each OVW show. On March 7, 2007, The Basham Brothers returned to OVW and defeated Wyatt Young and Mike Tolar in a dark match.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007) ===
On April 20, 2007, Damaja and Doug Basham took on Rhino in a Derby City Street Fight, which Doug Basham lost. Basham and Damaja both appeared alongside Christy Hemme at the April 30 &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; TV Tapings. They were then revealed on the May 10 &quot;Impact!&quot; to be the mystery team facing the Voodoo Kin Mafia at Sacrifice 2007 in a match which they won. 

===Later career (2007–2008)===
They would participated in the Chris Candido Cup 2007 tournament in IWA Mid-South defeating Silas Young and Dysfunction on May 25, and Axl Rotten and Mickie Knuckles on May 26 before losing to the Thomaselli Brothers in the semi-finals that same night.

That same year they appeared in Juggalo Championship Wrestling losing in an eight team elimination match for the JCW Tag Team Championships to Necro Butcher and Mad Man Pondo on August 11, 2007. Their last match together was on April 26, 2008, as they defeated Adam Rich and Shorty Biggs at JCW Slam TV Tour in Sauget, Illinois.

He wrestled his last match for Insanity Pro Wrestling, unsuccessfully challenging Joey Owens for the IPW Mid-American Championship on July 5, 2008.

<doc id="312521" wikidata="Q3790832" url="?curid=312521" title="Piranha Brothers">
<text>&quot;Piranha Brothers&quot; is a Monty Python sketch from the first episode of the second series of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. The 14th episode of the series overall, it premiered on BBC1 in the United Kingdom on 15 September 1970. The sketch constitutes a loose pastiche of the Richardson gang and the Kray twins, notorious gangsters from the East End of London in the 1950s and 1960s.

A slightly re-worked version of the sketch appeared on the album &quot;Another Monty Python Record&quot;, released in the UK on 8 October 1971, and in the United States on 21 August 1972. It was also featured in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot;, published in 1971.

==Plot==
The premise for the sketch is a BBC current affairs documentary programme, inexplicably titled &quot;Ethel the Frog&quot;, retrospectively covering the exploits of the brothers Doug and Dinsdale Piranha. We learn through the mockumentary that Dinsdale and Doug were born &#x27;on probation&#x27; in the slums of London, with their father, Arthur Piranha, employed as a scrap‐metal dealer and TV quizmaster. The brothers are reported to intimidate their victims through &#x27;violence and sarcasm&#x27;. Through a series of interviews with their victims, we find out that Dinsdale has a peculiar habit of nailing his foes&#x27; heads to the floor, while Doug is reported to be more vicious by assailing his enemies with &#x27;sarcasm&#x27; and that &quot;He knew all the tricks, dramatic irony, metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and... satire&quot;. One of those interviewed says he has &#x27;seen grown men pull off their own heads rather than face Doug&#x27;.

We are also told by another interviewee, that Dinsdale is afraid of &quot;Spiny Norman&quot;, a gigantic imaginary hedgehog whose reported size varies based on his mood. The threat of Norman has affected Dinsdale so severely that it leads him to launch a nuclear attack on an aircraft hangar, where Norman was thought to have resided, at Luton Airfield on 22 February 1966, attracting the attention of the authorities and causing a trans-Atlantic pursuit led by Police Superintendent Harry &quot;Snapper&quot; Organs. At the end of the sketch, which also ends the episode, the creature is revealed as being real and appearing in an animated form bellowing “Dinsdale”, beside various English landmarks as the credits roll.

==Album and book==
&quot;Another Monty Python Record&quot;, released in 1971, features the sketch with a slightly different version, whereas instead of a nuclear attack on the airport, the brothers are said to have napalmed Cheltenham. This version ends with one of the Piranha Brothers&#x27; associates interrupting the recording and accidentally scratching the record, causing a continuous loop in the album&#x27;s run out groove. The sketch can also be found being re-told in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot;.

==Influence and in culture==
A heavy metal group took its name, Ethel the Frog, from this sketch. The band is best known for taking part in the &quot;Metal for Muthas&quot; multi-artist compilation album, released in 1980.

The sketch is notable for being highlighted on various &#x27;best of Month Python lists&#x27; featured in magazines, newspapers and websites. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the act at number 5 on their top 20 essential sketches; &quot;GQ Magazine&quot; said it was one of four notable mockumentaries; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; included it in their funniest routines from the series; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported it as number 5 on their 10 funniest skits; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; gave it top ranking as number 1 on their compilation of funniest performances; and &quot;Nerdist&quot; said the piece was one of &quot;The 8 and a Half Most Underrated Monty Python Sketches&quot;.

Memorable quotes from the sketch have also been referenced in newspaper and magazine articles throughout the years since it was first broadcast in 1970.

<doc id="312522" wikidata="Q467334" url="?curid=312522" title="Kondō Isami">
<text>was a Japanese swordsman and samurai of the late Edo period. He was the fourth generation master of Tennen Rishin-ryū and was famed for his role as commander of the Shinsengumi.

==Background==
He was born Miyagawa Katsugorō to a farmer Miyagawa Hisajirō and his wife Miyo in Kami-Ishihara village in Musashi Province (present city of Chōfu) in Western Tokyo on November 9, 1834. He had two older brothers, Otojirō (音次郎; later known as Otogorō 音五郎) and Kumezō (粂蔵; later known as Sōbei 惣兵衛) and an older sister Rie (リエ), who died two years before he was born. Katsugorō began training at the Shieikan (the main dojo of the Tennen Rishin-ryū) in 1848.

As a young man he was said to be an avid reader, and especially liked the stories of the &quot;Forty-seven rōnin&quot; and the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. His renown as a scholar and his fame at having defeated a group of thieves who tried to break into his family home was great, and caught the attention of Kondō Shūsuke, the third generation master of the Tennen Rishin-ryū. Shūsuke wasted no time in adopting the young Katsugorō in 1849, who first took the name of Shimazaki Katsuta (島崎勝太). According to a record in the possession of the former Gozu-tennōsha Shrine 牛頭天王社 (now the Hino Yasaka-jinja Shrine 日野八坂神社), Katsuta is listed, with full common name and formal name, as Shimazaki Isami Fujiwara (no) Yoshitake (島崎勇藤原義武), and thus, had the name Isami (勇) as of 1858, the document&#x27;s date.

Kondō was said to have owned a katana called &quot;Kotetsu&quot; (虎徹), the work of the 17th century swordsmith Nagasone Kotetsu. However, the authenticity of his &quot;Kotetsu&quot; is highly debatable. According to Yasu Kizu&#x27;s pamphlet on the swordmaker Kotetsu, Kondō&#x27;s sword may actually have been made by Minamoto no Kiyomaro, a swordmaker of high repute roughly contemporary to Kondō.

Kondō married Matsui Tsune in 1860. This was an advantageous match for Kondō as Otsune was the daughter of Matsui Yasogorō (松井八十五郎), a retainer to the Shimizu-Tokugawa clan. On September 30, 1861, Isami became the fourth generation master (&quot;sōke no yondai me&quot; 宗家四代目) of Tennen Rishin-ryū, assuming the name Kondō Isami and taking charge of the Shieikan. A year later, his daughter Kondō Tama (1862–1886) was born.

Although he was never employed by the Shogunate before his Shinsengumi days, Kondō was a candidate for a teaching position at the Kōbusho in 1862. The Kobusho was an exclusive military training school, primarily for the use of the shogunal retainers, set up by the Shogunate in 1855 in order to reform the military system after the arrival of Perry&#x27;s Black Ships.

==Shinsengumi period==
In 1863, the Tokugawa shogunate organized a massive group of &quot;rōnin&quot; for the purpose of protecting the shōgun Iemochi during his time in Kyoto. Kondō joined the unit, which became known as the Rōshigumi, with his close friend Hijikata Toshizō, as well as Shieikan&#x27;s members and guests Yamanami Keisuke, Okita Sōji, Harada Sanosuke, Nagakura Shinpachi, Tōdō Heisuke, and Inoue Genzaburō. After the de facto commander Kiyokawa Hachirō revealed their true purpose as being Imperial supporters, the Rōshigumi was disbanded and most of the members returned to Edo. Kondō, Hijikata, former Mito retainer Serizawa Kamo, and a handful of others remained in Kyoto and formed the Mibu Rōshigumi. Acting under the direct orders of the shogunate, Matsudaira Katamori of Aizu undertook supervision of these men. Under the oversight of Aizu, acting in its role as Protector of Kyoto, they worked as police in the imperial capital.

On August 18, his unit was given the name &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;. In July 1864, the Shinsengumi became well known for arresting a cell of shishi (the incident was known as the &quot;Ikedaya Jiken&quot;, or Ikedaya Affair).

Kondō later had at least two mistresses in Kyoto, Miyuki and Oko, who were both geishas, with the latter he had an illegitimate daughter named Oyu, who would later become a geisha as well at Gion.

On July 10, 1867, Kondō became a hatamoto, along with the rest of the Shinsengumi.

==Boshin War==

After suffering a gunshot wound at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in January 1868, Kondō returned to Edo. There he met with the military commander Katsu Kaishū and was promoted to the rank of wakadoshiyori (&quot;wakadoshiyori-kaku&quot; 若年寄格) in the rapidly disintegrating Tokugawa administration. Kondō created a new unit, , based on the surviving remnants of the Shinsengumi and led them under the alias of Okubo Tsuyoshi. They departed from Edo for Kōfu Castle on March 24 on orders to suppress uprisings there. Upon receiving news on March 28 that Kōfu Castle had been taken by Imperial Court forces led by Itagaki Taisuke, they settled at a town of Katsunuma five miles east of Kōfu.

On March 29, 1868, Kondō and his unit were attacked by the Imperial forces at the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma, holding out for about two hours but ultimately losing. They narrowly escaped from the battle and retreated to Edo.

On April 11, 1868, Kondō, Hijikata and their unit departed Edo again and set up temporary headquarters at the Kaneko family estate, northeast of Edo. Kondō later changed his alias from Okubo Tsuyoshi to Okubo Yamato.

Later on April 25, 1868, they moved to a new headquarters in Nagareyama.

==Execution==
While training at Nagareyama on April 26, 1868, Kondo and his unit were caught by surprise by Imperial forces. The Vice-chief of Staff Arima Tota of Satsuma Domain suspected that &quot;Okubo Yamato&quot; was Kondō himself, and ordered him brought back to the Imperial forces camp at Koshigaya. Kondō was then taken to Itabashi on April 27, 1868, for questioning. On the same day Hijikata went to Edo to see Katsu Kaishū and asked for his help in getting a pardon for Kondō. The following day, April 28, a messenger arrived at Itabashi with a letter seemingly written by Katsu requesting that Kondō&#x27;s life be spared. However, the messenger was arrested and the request was denied.

Kondō was put on trial on April 30, 1868 and declared guilty. As a result, Kondō was beheaded by the executioner Yokokura Kisoji at the Itabashi execution grounds on May 17, 1868. Among the crowd witnessing his execution was his nephew Miyagawa Yūgorō. Kondō&#x27;s head was put on a pike for public display.

Three days later on May 20, 1868, Kondō&#x27;s body was claimed by his nephew to be taken back to Osawa, Edo to be buried, while his head was salted and moved to Kyoto, where it was displayed on a pike on Sanjō Ōhashi.

While on display on the bridge, Kondō&#x27;s head was taken away by Saitō Hajime, who would later ask the priest Sonku Giten to hold a memorial service for him. The head was taken by the priest when he moved to Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture, and buried in a small mound behind the Hozoji temple.

According to Tani Tateki (1837–1911) of the Tosa Domain, Kondō was arrested and executed by the new government (formed mostly by samurai from Chōshū han and Satsuma han) as a direct result of being accused of the assassination of Sakamoto Ryōma. Tani continued to insist that Kondō was responsible for the killing even after former Mimawarigumi member Imai Nobuo confessed in 1870.

==Grave memorials==

Kondō has at least four grave sites; it is believed that the first of them was the grave erected at Ten&#x27;nei-ji Temple (天寧寺) in Aizu by Hijikata Toshizō. Hijikata, was convalescing nearby from an injury sustained at the Battle of Utsunomiya, brought Kondō&#x27;s hair there and was said to have personally supervised the preparation and construction of the site. Kondō&#x27;s funerary name, &quot;Kanten&#x27;inden&#x27;junchūseigi-daikōji&quot; (貫天院殿純忠誠義大居士) is believed to have been granted by Matsudaira Katamori.

Another grave site is located at Ryugenji Temple in Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo where his body was brought by his nephew and buried with his family.

A grave mound containing Kondō&#x27;s head is located behind the Hozoji temple in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.

Another grave is located on the memorial known as &quot;Grave of Shinsengumi&quot;, in front of Itabashi Station near the location of former Itabashi execution grounds. It was erected in 1875 by Nagakura Shinpachi, with the help of Matsumoto Ryōjun and several surviving former Shinsengumi members including Saitō Hajime. It memorializes Kondō and Hijikata Toshizō.

==Legacy==
In 1876, Kondō&#x27;s 14-year-old daughter Kondō Tama married his nephew Miyagawa Yūgorō, who succeed him as a fifth generation master of Tennen Rishin-ryū and took the name of Kondō Yūgorō. Kondō Yūgorō established his own dojo, Hatsuunkan, in Kami-ishihara (present day Chōfu, Tokyo). Tama and Yūgorō&#x27;s only child, a son named Kondō Hisatarō, was born in 1883. Kondō Tama died three years later in 1886 and Yūgorō later remarried at least twice.

In 1905, Kondō Hisatarō was killed in action in the Russo-Japanese War at the age of 22. This marked the end of the Kondō Isami bloodline.

==In fiction==
Kondō Isami is often depicted in fiction, across different media, including television, film, books, anime, and manga.

The NHK Taiga drama &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; depicted the life of Kondō.

Kondō Isa&quot;o&quot; from &quot;Gintama&quot; is roughly based on him. He also appears in the video-game-turned-anime series &quot;Hakuouki Shinsengumi Kitan&quot;. Kondō also makes appearances in the series &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot; and &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;, among others. Kondō is briefly mentioned in the anime series &quot;Soar High! Isami&quot; by the main characters&#x27; ancestors who are also members of the Shinsengumi. The female protagonist of the series, Isami Hanaoka, is named after and based on him. He is briefly shown in the anime &quot;Golden Kamuy&quot;. Kondō is portrayed by and modelled after Eiichiro Funakoshi in the video game &quot;Ryu ga Gotoku Ishin!&quot;, serving as a major character in the plot of the game. In the remake, &quot;Like a Dragon: Ishin!&quot;, he is instead voiced by Akio Otsuka and has the likeness of Koichi Adachi, a character from &quot;&quot;.

Kondō Isami appeared in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning&quot; in 2021. He was portrayed by Takahiro Fujimoto.

Kondō Isami appeared in Record of Ragnarok: Season 2. Kondō is depicted as one of humanity&#x27;s greatest warriors; sent to fight the mythological Gods for the fate of humanity.

<doc id="312526" wikidata="Q7155447" url="?curid=312526" title="Pauper's oath">
<text>A pauper&#x27;s oath is a sworn statement or oath by a person of being completely destitute or a pauper, without much money or property.

A person without the ability to pay court costs, also known as &quot;being indigent&quot;, has the option to swear a pauper&#x27;s oath to file a lawsuit without paying filing fees. Prisoners filing legal actions often use a pauper&#x27;s oath because persons in prison are often completely without money or any means of acquiring any.

Historically, especially during the Great Depression, the pauper&#x27;s oath was required as a prerequisite for receiving welfare in the United States.

One pauper&#x27;s oath used when establishing indigent status under US federal law is as follows:

&quot;So help me God,&quot; at the end, is optional.

<doc id="312527" wikidata="Q771214" url="?curid=312527" title="Parral, Chihuahua">
<text>Hidalgo del Parral is a city and seat of the municipality of Hidalgo del Parral in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It is located in the southern part of the state, from the state capital, the city of Chihuahua, Chihuahua. As of 2015, the city of Hidalgo del Parral had a population of 109,510 inhabitants, while the metro area had a population of 129,688 inhabitants. During the colonial period the city was a significant supplier of silver to the Spanish empire and was known as San José del Parral. The name of the city was changed after independence from Spain, in honour of Fr Miguel Hidalgo, widely considered the &#x27;Father of the Country&#x27;.

== Geology ==
Hidalgo del Parral mushroomed from the base of a hill of silver known as the Cerro la Prieta. The hill, is a part of the eastern foothill belt of the Sierra Madre Occidental, characterized by thick eroded deposits of tertiary volcanics. The bed rocks of both sedimentary and volcanic origin supply both lead and lead-free silver vein bearing ores.

Parral&#x27;s topography is characterized by both the silver vein bearing ores of its hill and adjacent basins that allowed for: the growth of crops such as maize, cattle grazing, and easy routes of communication to the state capital.

==History==
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Parral was once a bustling center for silver mining. 

According to legend, Juan Rangel de Biezma came here in 1629, picked up a rock on the “Cerro la Prieta” (La Prieta Hill), licked it and proclaimed, “There is a mineral deposit here.” This deposit produced silver for 340 years.

Despite legend, as early as 1567, the silver mines at Santa Barbara were established in the territory of the Conchos people. However, in 1631, a vast new silver strike was made in what is now southern Chihuahua. Later, in 1640, it was declared &quot;Capital of the World of Silver&quot; by monarch Philip IV of Spain, at the very height of the Spanish Empire, that included territories in Eastern Asia, Italy, and the Low Countries.

=== Colonial Era ===

==== Urban design and economy ====
Parral&#x27;s urban design during the colonial period did not mirror the stereotypical checkboard grid layout. Instead, the city developed with housing situated as close to the mine and hill as possible. Over time these temporary quarters evolved to more permanent, &quot;jacales&quot;, adobe structures surrounded by corrals plots of vegetables.

The development of Parral&#x27;s association with its grain farms and stock ranches was based on the region&#x27;s major physical characteristics and the necessity for agriculture to sustain the region&#x27;s growing population. Under colonial authority the region was developed as a permanent mine-ranch settlement complex, requiring large amounts of food and labor.

Despite the fact Parral was not the most lucrative of the northern Mexican colonial mines, by 1640 Parral&#x27;s population was 8,500, making the town the largest north of the tropic of cancer in the Americas, and nowhere else in the Americas during the colonial period was there a larger concentration of enslaved African people living in a single place.

==== Mining and labor ====
Labor within the mines was challenging, physically brutal, and frequently exploitative. The principal shaft of the mine at Cerro Prieta was 420 feet deep. In order to access the metals lodged beneath the ground, workers, dug with picks, wedges, metal points, and crowbars. Tools weighed at times up to forty pounds, and miners were working for twelve hours or more a day. Alongside grueling physical labor, miners were also at risk for danger on the job. Diggers regularly fell into shafts, were crushed by collapsing sections of the mine, and breathed in large amounts of silica causing scar tissue and lung decay. The inhalation of silica in the mines would build up in miner&#x27;s lungs over years gradually causing severe lung scarring, low oxygen levels, and eventually death.

After metals were retrieved beneath the surface, miners, frequently enslaved Indigenous and African men utilized leather bags to bring metals to the surface. Derived from the Nahuatl word, &quot;tenatl&quot;, a fiber or leather bag, ore carriers were generally referred to as &quot;tenateros&quot;.Carrying 225–300-pound bags of metallic rock from the shafts to the surface, enslaved miners crawled through low passages and ascended by way of pine logs and ladders, before being unloaded into carts for transport.

A member of the Reales de Minas in Northern Mexico, the mines in Parral had a distinctive militaristic political and social structure. Labor for the mines of Parral was initially hard to obtain as the Chichimec people were not sedentary and were able to resist Spanish forced labor in the repartimiento system. Thus, systems of free labor emerged in the mines of Hidalgo del Parral that attracted large numbers of Aztec and Tarascan workers from the Southern mining company, Axace and Xixime workers from Sinaloa, Opata from Sonora and some Huichol and Tepehuan workers from Durango. Connecting networks of migratory native mine workers and suppliers across the region, the economic sphere of Parral extended far beyond the colonial center&#x27;s geographic boundaries.

After extraction, metals were transported from the mine to dozens of estates, known as haciendas, across the region for processing. Utilizing the smelting method to crush the ore into coarse gravel and combine it with molten lead, workers separated silver from rock. A few haciendas in Parral did not use the smelting process, and instead utilized patio amalgamation.

=== Independence ===
The large area of southern Chihuahua inhabited by the Tarahumara people included the highway between the mining districts of Parral, Cusihuiriachic, and Chihuahua. Asarco managed the La Prieta mine until the boom ended in the early 1930s; the minerals that were extracted were sent to the United States for final processing and then shipped back to Mexico, the US and other markets. After the end of the silver mining boom, Parral was almost completely abandoned in the early 1930s. 

Currently, Parral is a medium-sized town in the state of Chihuahua mainly dedicated to commerce and is an important regional center for trade between the southern regions of Chihuahua and northern Durango. It received its first local television station in 1969, the now-defunct XHJMA-TV channel 3, and it currently has one local station, XHMH-TV channel 13.

Parral is often associated with several historical figures, including Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa, who was assassinated in Parral on July 20, 1923, and initially buried here; and border ruffian &quot;Dirty&quot; Dave Rudabaugh, a sometime friend and foe of Billy the Kid. 

Locals and visitors of Parral can visit the Palacio de Alvardo, a late nineteenth century house belonging to a mining baron, as well as, if accompanied by a guide, the mine itself. Its intricate network of streets and alleys are distinctive features of the city, helping to preserve its colonial style. Urban development has been slow due to the lack of potable water and its complex physical geography.

==Notable sites==
===El Palacio de Alvarado===
It belonged to one of the most prominent families in Parral, descendants of Pedro Alvarado owning the silver mine called “La Palmilla.” This family was rich enough to offer the President Porfirio Díaz to pay the national external debt. The palace was constructed by Federico Amérigo Rouvier and it is now a museum and cultural center. It has preserved much of the original European-made furniture. The walls of the patio were painted by Italian painter Antonio Decanini between 1946 and 1948.

=== El Hotel Hidalgo ===
This historical building was a gift from Don Pedro Alvarado to Pancho Villa and is located next to the Plaza Guillermo Baca.

===La Casa de la Familia Griensen (the Griensen Family House)===
This is where Elisa Griensen was born. She distinguished herself in Parral history by fighting against a contingent of U.S. soldiers sent to capture Pancho Villa after he crossed the border and attacked Columbus, New Mexico.

===The Francisco Villa Museum===
The Francisco Villa Museum is a historical building located on the street near the spot where Villa&#x27;s enemies waited days for him to pass and ultimately assassinated him in 1923. Every year in July, his death is reenacted here.

===Casa Stallforth===
This was a beautiful and luxurious palace (during the era), with a beautiful baroque style; decorated in the facade with many beings from the Nordic mythology, that once belonged to the Stallforth family—who along with the Alvarado family, became the town&#x27;s main benefactors, contributing much to its infrastructure.

==Notable events==
The annual staging of the Murder of Francisco Villa, a recreation using props from the era, in the exact place of the historical event.

The annual Cabalgata Villista, is a long-distance horse ride with statewide massive participation and a spectacular visual event as thousands of horses enter the city (see Cavalcade).

==Food==
In addition to its diverse and rich History, Parral is famous for its traditional foods. Parral was recently named as one of the “Ten Gastronomic Marvels of Mexico,” primarily for its artisan confectioneries &quot;dulces de leche&quot;. These include a wide variety of candies and pastries from old recipes based on milk, sugar, and natural fruits. Some other notable recipes with a touch of Parral are enchiladas, rayadas, barbacoa, steaks and cabrito (goat).

===Dulces de leche===
Dulces de leche are cooked-milk confections found nationwide in Mexico; Parral has been historically acclaimed since the 1930s because of the distinctive flavor of its dulces de leche—candies made with nuts like pecans, peanuts, hazelnuts, and fruits such as apricot, pineapple, coconut and others. Parral&#x27;s candies have been shipped around the world; interesting destinations include Vatican City, Washington DC, and London.

These traditional confections arrived in Parral in the early 20th century. The origin of recipes is unknown, although it is believed that they arrived in southern Mexico from Europe during the colonial times. Then, these recipes were transferred to later generations.

One of the most famous confectionery artisans in Parral was Don Pablo Rodríguez, founder of La Gota de Miel. Don Pablito (as the Parralenses knew him) was born in Teocaltiche, Jalisco in the late 19th century. He and his wife arrived in Parral in the early 20th century, after working for several years in the State of Coahuila as a baker and a cook in the Hacienda del Rosario (now Parras de la Fuente) for Francisco Madero and Mercedes González (parents of President Francisco I. Madero). It is believed that their recipes might have acquired some influence from professional chefs also working in the hacienda at the time.

Several local artisans in Parral had recently—in the late 1990s—attempted to imitate &quot;Don Pablito&#x27;s&quot; original recipe without success.

===Enchiladas===
Enchiladas are a specialty Mexican plate also found nationwide, and Parral is traditionally famous for its delicious enchiladas. They are a rolled maize tortilla stuffed with meat and covered with a tomato and chile sauce. Enchiladas can be filled with a variety of ingredients, including meat, cheese, beans, potatoes, vegetables, or seafood.

These other traditions in Parral started in the early 20th century and they gained notoriety in the mid-late 20th century. Enchiladas originated in Mexico. Anthropological evidence suggests that the indigenous people of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán. In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, &quot;El cocinero mexicano&quot; (&quot;The Mexican Chef&quot;), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galván Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Diccionario de Cocina&quot;, published in 1845.[4][8] Probably, as with the dulces de leche, these recipes arrived to Parral from immigrants from the south of Mexico.

Among the most famous cookers of enchiladas in Parral was Doña Cuca, near the historical Calicanto bridge.

===Barbacoa===
Barbacoa is meat from cattle or sheep slowly cooked over an open fire or, more traditionally, in a hole dug in the ground covered with maguey leaves; although the interpretation is loose, in the present day it may refers to meat (traditionally whole heads are used)steamed until tender.

During colonial and post-colonial times, Parral was famous because of its delectable barbacoa or birria de hoyo. Such barbacoa contained ingredients as laurel (bay leaf), garlic, maguey, onions, and other condiments. It was one of the luscious foods of the executives, foreigners, and miners working in the silver mines at Parral.

==Sports==
Judo
Parral has one of the best clubs of Judo throughout Latin America: &quot;Judokan Parral&quot;. It is a Judo academy in one of the most isolated places in Mexico. Among the most recognized alumni of Judokan is Vanessa Zambotti, and Olympic judo-fighter with international experience, winner of a gold medal in the XIX Central American and Caribbean Games and silver medalist at the Judo World Cup in 2008. Judo in Parral is recognized at Panamerican level thanks to Judokan Parral.

Judo is increasingly becoming important for future generations who follow the sport closely in the North of Mexico. Judo in Parral is being recorded through oral testimonies and photographs to sketch this part of northern Mexico in popular history, including the impact of judo among practitioners.
Baseball
Parral is famous, primarily in the North of Mexico, for its baseball team &quot;Los Mineros de Parral&quot;.

<text>A  is a subdivision of the cities of Japan that are large enough to have been designated by government ordinance. Wards are used to subdivide each city designated by government ordinance (&quot;designated city&quot;). The 23 special wards of Tokyo Metropolis have a municipal status, and are not the same as other entities referred to as &quot;ku&quot;, although their predecessors were.

Wards are local entities directly controlled by the municipal government. They handle administrative functions such as &quot;koseki&quot; registration, health insurance, and property taxation. Many wards have affiliated residents&#x27; organizations for a number of tasks, although these do not have any legal authority.

== List of wards ==
==Special wards of Tokyo==
The special wards of Tokyo are not normal wards in the usual sense of the term, but instead are administrative units governed similarly to cities.

==See also==
*District (China), the original use of the &quot;ku&quot; kanji, still in use in Mainland China
*Administrative districts of South Korea, also pronounced &quot;gu&quot;
*District (Taiwan), same use of the &quot;ku&quot; in administrative divisions in the ROC Free Area

<text>Katie Scarlett O&#x27;Hara is a fictional character and the protagonist in Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and in the 1939 film of the same name, where she is portrayed by Vivien Leigh. She also is the main character in the 1970 musical &quot;Scarlett&quot; and the 1991 book &quot;Scarlett&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; that was written by Alexandra Ripley and adapted for a television mini-series in 1994. During early drafts of the original novel, Mitchell referred to her heroine as &quot;Pansy&quot;, and did not decide on the name &quot;Scarlett&quot; until just before the novel went to print. PBS has called O&#x27;Hara &quot;quite possibly the most famous female character in American history...&quot;

==Biography==
Scarlett O&#x27;Hara is the oldest living child of Gerald O&#x27;Hara and Ellen O&#x27;Hara (née Robillard). She was born in 1845 on her family&#x27;s plantation Tara in Georgia. She was named Katie Scarlett, after her father&#x27;s mother, but is always called Scarlett, except by her father, who refers to her as &quot;Katie Scarlett&quot;. She is from a Catholic family of Irish ancestry on her paternal side and French ancestry on her maternal side, descending from her mother&#x27;s old-money Robillard family in Savannah. Scarlett has black hair, green eyes, and fair skin. She is famous for her fashionably small waist. Scarlett has two younger sisters, Susan Elinor (&quot;Suellen&quot;) O&#x27;Hara and Caroline Irene (&quot;Carreen&quot;) O&#x27;Hara, and three little brothers who died in infancy. Her baby brothers are buried in the family burying ground at Tara, and each was named Gerald O&#x27;Hara Jr.

Scarlett begins the novel unmarried, but with many beaus in the county; however, as a result of Ashley Wilkes&#x27; rejection, she marries Charles Hamilton, who dies before the birth of their son, Wade Hampton Hamilton. Later, in the midst of Tara&#x27;s threat, Scarlett marries Frank Kennedy, Suellen&#x27;s beau, for financial security for Tara and providing for the family. They have Ella Lorena Kennedy together. Kennedy dies in a KKK raid on Shantytown, where Scarlett was attacked, because the Union army knew about it and laid a trap. She continues to marry Rhett Butler, for his money, again, although she admits she is “fond” of him. They have Eugenia Victoria, a.k.a. “Bonnie Blue” Butler; however, she dies after a tragic riding accident. Unable to reconcile, Rhett leaves Scarlett, although Scarlett ends the novel vowing to try to win him back.

==Character summary==
When the novel opens, Scarlett O’Hara is sixteen. She is vain, self-centered, and very spoiled by her wealthy parents. She can also be insecure, but is very intelligent, despite the Old South&#x27;s pretense of ignorance and helplessness. She is somewhat unusual among Southern women, whom society preferred to act as dainty creatures who needed protection from their men. Scarlett is aware that she is only acting empty-headed, and resents the &quot;necessity&quot; of it, unlike most of her Southern belle peers, including Melanie Hamilton and India Wilkes.

Outwardly, Scarlett is the picture of Southern charm and womanly virtues, and a popular belle among the country males. The one man she truly desires, however, is her neighbor, Ashley Wilkes—the one man she cannot have. The Wilkes family has a tradition of intermarrying with their cousins, and Ashley is betrothed to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton of Atlanta. Scarlett&#x27;s motivation in the early part of the novel centers on her desire to win Ashley&#x27;s heart. When he refuses her advances—which no “Southern Lady” would be so forward as to make—she takes refuge in childish rage, and she spitefully accepts the proposal of Charles Hamilton, Melanie&#x27;s brother, in a misguided effort to get back at Ashley and Melanie.

Rhett Butler, a wealthy older bachelor and a societal pariah, overhears Scarlett express her love to Ashley during a barbecue at Twelve Oaks, the Wilkes&#x27; estate. Rhett admires Scarlett&#x27;s willfulness and her departure from accepted propriety as well as her beauty. He pursues Scarlett, but is aware of her impetuousness, childish spite, and her fixation on Ashley. He assists Scarlett in defiance of proper Victorian mourning customs when her husband, Charles Hamilton, dies in a training camp. Rhett encourages her spirited behavior in Atlanta society. Scarlett, privately frustrated from the strict rules of polite society, finds friendship with Rhett liberating.

The Civil War sweeps away the lifestyle in which Scarlett was raised, and Southern society falls into ruin. Scarlett, left destitute after Sherman&#x27;s army marches through Georgia, becomes the sole source of strength for her family. Her character begins to harden as her relatives, the family slaves and the Wilkes family look to her for protection from homelessness and starvation. Scarlett becomes money-conscious and more materialistic in her motivation to ensure her family survives and Tara stays in her possession, while other Georgian farmers lose their homes. This extends to first offering herself as a mistress to Rhett; although after Rhett&#x27;s rejection, Scarlett resorts to marrying her younger sister&#x27;s beau, Frank Kennedy, investing in and starting a business herself, engaging in controversial business practices and even exploiting convict labor in order to make her lumber business profit. Her conduct results in the accidental death of Frank, and shortly after she marries Rhett Butler for &quot;fun&quot; and because he is very wealthy. They have a little girl named Bonnie, but she dies from a horseback riding accident that leaves Rhett and Scarlett&#x27;s relationship unstable.

Scarlett is too fixated on Ashley Wilkes to realize her pursuit of him is misdirected until the climax of the novel. With the death of Melanie Wilkes, she realizes her pursuit of Ashley was a childish romance and she has loved Rhett Butler for some time. She pursues Rhett from the Wilkes home to their home, only to discover he has given up hope of ever receiving her love, and is about to leave her. After telling him she loves him, he refuses to stay with her, which leads to the famous line in the movie, &quot;Frankly, my dear, I don&#x27;t give a damn.&quot; Wracked with grief but determined to win him back, Scarlett returns to Tara to regain her strength and create a plan to reunite with Rhett.

== Common character analysis ==
Scarlett&#x27;s character portrayed in both the novel and 1939 film is, at face-value, unscrupulous and selfish, but her character development ultimately portrays multiple stigmas throughout that support Mitchell&#x27;s theme. In a rare interview, Mitchell admitted the theme of the novel was “survival,” specifically shown is exploring human behavior in the face of the catastrophe of the Civil War. Decades later, literary critics and authors agree that Scarlett&#x27;s revolution from a spoiled, wealthy girl—typical of her socioeconomic status—to becoming an independent woman in an unforgiving society and unstable economy is a testament to the development of Mitchell&#x27;s character.

Lisa Bertagnoli, author of &quot;Scarlett Rules&quot;, compared Scarlett to a chameleon by morphing herself from a pampered girl to a &quot;no-nonsense businesswoman responsible for feeding not only herself, but her extended family as well.&quot;. Scarlett stands out in the novel because she alone, among her female peers, is the only one who survives and thrives &quot;despite&quot; Sherman&#x27;s March through Atlanta, &quot;despite&quot; being widowed twice, &quot;despite&quot; being a woman in a patriarchal society. She was told &quot;no&quot; to almost every action she did to survive, by both societal standards and her female and male peers around her, such as marrying Frank Kennedy for money or even running a successful business, and in return, she told them &quot;watch me&quot; in the process.

Scarlett struggled with her status as a woman because of standards of the &quot;Southern Lady&quot; invoked and shown at the beginning of the novel, and displayed throughout Scarlett&#x27;s peers, embodied in Melanie Wilkes. However, this is clearly challenged by Scarlett because of the dire conditions she is meant to face and endure. Therefore, those standards of the &quot;Southern Lady&quot; are discarded because the standards do not meet her physical needs, nor are useful to her physical survival. The essence of the public responsibility of being a &quot;lady&quot; is flagrantly disregarded because of her commitment to survival (Fox-Genovese, p. 400). Thus, she is ostracized from her peers. Scarlett does not uphold the same code of standard as she did in the beginning of the novel because her motivations changed from societal and class standings to economic status and physical survival.

==Inspiration for the character==

Margaret Mitchell used to say that her &quot;Gone with The Wind&quot; characters were not based on real people, although modern researchers have found similarities to some of the people in Mitchell&#x27;s own life. Scarlett&#x27;s upbringing resembled that of Mitchell&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Annie Fitzgerald Stephens (1844–1934), who was raised predominantly Irish Catholic on a plantation near Jonesboro in Fayette, not unlike the O’Hara family. Mitchell was engaged three times, although only married twice. Her first engagement was to Clifford Henry, a bayonet instructor at Camp Gordon in World War I. He was killed overseas in October 1918 while fighting in France, similar to O’Hara and her first husband, Charles Hamilton. Mitchell&#x27;s mother, Maybelle Stephens Mitchell, contracted influenza and died shortly before Mitchell could reach home, similar to Ellen O’Hara dying before Scarlett fled Atlanta. Rhett Butler is thought to be based on Mitchell&#x27;s first husband, Red Upshaw because Upshaw left Atlanta for the Midwest and never returned. Her second marriage was to John Robert Marsh, and they were married until her death in 1949.

== In the 1939 film ==

===Casting===
While the studio and the public agreed that the part of Rhett Butler should go to Clark Gable (except for Clark Gable himself), casting for the role of Scarlett was harder. The search for an actress to play Scarlett in the film version of the novel famously drew the biggest names in the history of cinema, such as Bette Davis (who had been cast as a Southern belle in &quot;Jezebel&quot; in 1938), and Katharine Hepburn, who went so far as demanding an appointment with producer David O. Selznick and saying, &quot;I am Scarlett O&#x27;Hara! The role is practically written for me.&quot; Selznick replied rather bluntly, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years.&quot; Jean Arthur and Lucille Ball were also considered, as well as relatively unknown actress Doris Davenport. Susan Hayward was &quot;discovered&quot; when she tested for the part, and the career of Lana Turner developed quickly after her screen test. Tallulah Bankhead and Joan Bennett were widely considered to be the most likely choices until they were supplanted by Paulette Goddard.

The young English actress Vivien Leigh, virtually unknown in America, saw that several English actors, including Ronald Colman and Leslie Howard, were in consideration for the male leads in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Her agent happened to be the London representative of the Myron Selznick talent agency, headed by David Selznick&#x27;s brother, Myron. Leigh asked Myron to put her name into consideration as Scarlett on the eve of the American release of her picture &quot;Fire Over England&quot; in February 1938. David Selznick watched both &quot;Fire Over England&quot; and her most recent picture, &quot;A Yank at Oxford&quot;, that month, and thought she was excellent but in no way a possible Scarlett, for she was &quot;too British&quot;. But Myron Selznick arranged for David to first meet Leigh on the night in December 1938 when the burning of the Atlanta Depot was being filmed on the Forty Acres backlot that Selznick International and RKO shared. Leigh and her then lover Laurence Olivier (later to be her husband) were visiting as guests of Myron Selznick, who was also Olivier&#x27;s agent, while Leigh was in Hollywood hoping for a part in Olivier&#x27;s current movie, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. In a letter to his wife two days later, David Selznick admitted that Leigh was &quot;the Scarlett dark horse&quot;, and after a series of screen tests, her casting was announced on January 13, 1939. Just before the shooting of the film, Selznick informed Ed Sullivan: &quot;Scarlett O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s parents were French and Irish. Identically, Miss Leigh&#x27;s parents are French and Irish.&quot;

In any case, Leigh was cast—despite public protest that the role was too &quot;American&quot; for an English actress—but Leigh was able to pull off the role so well that she eventually won an Academy Award for her performance as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara.

====Other actresses considered====
The search for Scarlett began shortly after the announcement of the film adaption, and lasted for over two years. Between late 1937 and mid-1938, approximately 128 actresses were nominated for the role of Scarlett through letters of suggestion sent to Selznick International Pictures from the public. The following actresses were among those considered or auditioned for the role, which required playing Scarlett from 16 years of age until she was 28 (actress age in 1939, the year of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;″s release, when Leigh was 26).

* Lucille Ball (28)
* Constance Bennett (35)
* Clara Bow (34)
* Mary Brian (33)
* Ruth Chatterton (47)
* Claudette Colbert (36)
* Joan Crawford (31–35)
* Bette Davis (31)
* Irene Dunne (41)
* Madge Evans (30)
* Glenda Farrell (35)
* Alice Faye (24)
* Joan Fontaine (22), sister of Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie (23)
* Kay Francis (34)
* Janet Gaynor (33)
* Katharine Hepburn (32)
* Miriam Hopkins (37)
* Rochelle Hudson (23)
* Dorothy Lamour (25)
* Carole Lombard (31)
* Myrna Loy (34)
* Pola Negri (42)
* Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan (28)
* Merle Oberon (28)
* Ginger Rogers (28)
* Norma Shearer (37)
* Ann Sheridan (24)
* Gale Sondergaard, who also was considered for but ultimately lost the role of the Wicked Witch of the West the same year (40)
* Barbara Stanwyck (32)
* Gloria Stuart (29)
* Margaret Sullavan (30)
* Gloria Swanson (40)
* Mae West (46)
* Jane Wyman (22)
* Loretta Young (26)
Out of these considered, only 31 actresses made screen tests, including (with the date of their initial screen test and their age at the time):
* Louise Platt (September 1936, 21)
* Tallulah Bankhead (December 1936, 34)
* Liz Whitney Tippett (April 1937, 32)
* Linda Watkins (June 1937, 29)
* Adele Longmire (August 1937, 19)
* Haila Stoddard (November 1937, 23)
* Susan Hayward (December 1937, 20; tested under her birth name Edith Marrener)
* Brenda Marshall (February 1938, 22; tested under her birth name Ardis Ankerson)
* Paulette Goddard (February 1938, 27)
* Ellen Drew (February 1938, 23; tested under the name Terry Ray)
* Anita Louise (February 1938, 23)
* Margaret Tallichet (March 1938, 24)
* Frances Dee (March 1938, 28)
* Nancy Coleman (September 1938, 25)
* Doris Davenport (October 1938, 21; tested under her birth name Doris Jordan)
* Marcella Martin (October 1938, 22; eventually won the role of Cathleen Calvert)
* Margaret Hayes (October 1938, 21; tested under the name Fleurette DeBussy)
* Lana Turner (November 1938, 17)
* Diana Barrymore (November 1938, 17)
* Jean Arthur (December 1938, 38)
* Joan Bennett (December 1938, 28)
* Vivien Leigh (December 1938, 25)

Turner was eliminated after her screen test, with Cukor feeling she was too young to have the depth the role required.

By December 1938, Cukor and Selznick had narrowed the decision down to Goddard and Leigh. On December 21, both actresses were given technicolor screen tests, the only ones to receive the tests. Leigh was chosen following the tests, a controversial choice among the public since she was not an American.

===In other adaptations===
* A 1966 musical stage adaptation was a major hit in Japan and London&#x27;s West End, but failed to survive in America where it starred Lesley Ann Warren and Harve Presnell. It closed after engagements in Los Angeles and San Francisco, never opening on Broadway.
* In 1980 a film about the search for Scarlett O&#x27;Hara was made entitled &quot;&quot; with Morgan Brittany playing Vivien Leigh.
* In the 1994 TV mini-series based on the sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot;, the character was played by English actress Joanne Whalley.
* In the Margaret Martin musical &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara was originated by Jill Paice.
* In the South Korean stage production Girls&#x27; Generation member Seohyun played Scarlett, alongside Bada, former member of S.E.S.

==Comparisons to other characters==
Troy Patterson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; argued that Ally McBeal, the main character of the television series with the same name, has similarities to O&#x27;Hara and that &quot;Scarlett and Ally are fairy-tale princesses who bear about as much resemblance to real women as Barbie and Skipper.&quot; Patterson wrote that Ally is similar because she is also a child from a ruling class family, &quot;pines hopelessly after an unavailable dreamboat&quot;, and has a &quot;sassy black roommate&quot; in place of a &quot;mammy&quot; to &quot;comfort her&quot;. Other characters often compared to Scarlett include many female protagonists from other romantic epics, most notably Lara Antipova from the 1965 film &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; and Rose DeWitt Bukater from &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) as well as strong-willed women in history, such as Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette and Eva Peron.

Vivien Leigh&#x27;s subsequent Oscar-winning portrayal of southern belle Blanche DuBois on stage and in the 1951 film adaptation of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; has drawn comparison to her performance as Scarlett. The role was coincidentally originally written for Tallulah Bankhead, who had also auditioned for the Scarlett O&#x27;Hara role. The character of Blanche is often viewed as a middle-aged antithesis to the strong-willed youthful Scarlett. Blanche struggles with mental illness, violent abuse (from Stanley) and severe anxiety. Ultimately, unlike Scarlett who pulls herself together to overcome her troubles, Blanche descends into madness and gets committed to a mental institution.

==Ballet dance performances &amp; costumes==
Scarlett O&#x27;Hara ballet variations
* &quot;The Mary Poppins Doll&quot; variation
* &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; variation
* &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; variation

==In popular culture==
In the 1977 song &quot;Belle of the Ball&quot; written and recorded by Waylon Jennings off of Ol&#x27; Waylon he mentions Scarlett O’Hara in the opening verse as a comparison to the love of someone, presumed to be his wife Jessi Colter, gave to him.

&quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; parodied the film adaptation three times, most notably &quot;Went with the Wind!&quot; sketch in its tenth season. Carol Burnett parodied the role twice—once as &quot;Scarlett O&#x27;Fever&quot; and the other as &quot;Starlet O&#x27;Hara&quot;—while Vicki Lawrence briefly parodied the role another time. The &quot;Went with the Wind!&quot; sketch was listed by &quot;TV Guide&quot; as #2 in its list of &quot;The 50 Funniest TV Moments of All Time&quot; in January 1999, while Burnett&#x27;s dress designed by series costumer Bob Mackie is on display at the Smithsonian Institution.

In John Kennedy Toole&#x27;s posthumously published 1980 novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, an amateur dancer &quot;Harlett O&#x27;Hara&quot; (whose real name is Darlene) puts on a &quot;southern belle&quot; performance at Lana Lee&#x27;s Night of Joy bar. The name is a reference to Scarlett O&#x27;Hara. The names &quot;Harla,&quot; &quot;Scarla,&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Horror&quot; are also used in the vernacular to refer to her.

<text>Central Mountain Air Ltd. is a Canadian regional airline based in Smithers, British Columbia. It operates scheduled, charter, and transborder services. Its main base is Smithers Airport, with other bases at Calgary International Airport, Edmonton International Airport, Prince George Airport, and Vancouver International Airport.

== History ==
The airline was established and started operations in 1987; it is wholly owned by 580741 BC. In 1997 Central Mountain Air placed an order for additional Raytheon Beech 1900D Airliner aircraft and began operating as an Air Canada connector, replacing Air BC operating several routes within Alberta and British Columbia, latterly under the Air Canada Express banner. In October 2011, Central Mountain Air ceased its Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) with Air Canada. The agreement had been for flights from Calgary to Lethbridge, Medicine Hat and Cranbrook. Central Mountain Air continues to be an Air Canada codeshare partner for flights from Vancouver to Quesnel, and Williams Lake.

In late 2005, the first of two Dornier 328 were delivered to the airline, for use on chartered and scheduled flights. In 2014 they received their third Dornier 328. In March 2010, 580741 BC, the parent company of Central Mountain Air, purchased fellow British Columbia-based airline Hawkair. On November 18, 2016, Hawkair declared bankruptcy, had all assets seized for liquidation, and permanently suspended operations.

Central Mountain Air is the sister company of Northern Thunderbird Air, which operates charter and cargo services from Prince George.

== Destinations ==

Central Mountain Air operates services to the following domestic scheduled destinations (as of July 2024):
* British Columbia
** Fort Nelson (Fort Nelson Airport)
** Kelowna (Kelowna International Airport)
** Prince George (Prince George Airport)
** Quesnel (Quesnel Airport)

<doc id="312559" wikidata="Q182844" url="?curid=312559" title="Herat Province">
<text>Herat (Dari: هرات) is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the western part of the country. Together with Badghis, Farah, and Ghor provinces, it makes up the north-western region of Afghanistan. Its primary city and administrative capital is Herat City. The province of Herat is divided into about 17 districts and contains over 2,000 villages. It has a population of about 3,780,000, making it the second most populated province in Afghanistan behind Kabul Province. The population is multi-ethnic but largely Persian-speaking. Herat dates back to the Avestan times and was traditionally known for its wine. The city has a number of historic sites, including the Herat Citadel and the Musalla Complex. During the Middle Ages Herat became one of the important cities of Khorasan, as it was known as the Pearl of Khorasan.

The province of Herat shares a border with Iran in the west and Turkmenistan in the north, making it an important trading region. The Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline (TAPI) is expected to pass through Herat from Turkmenistan to Pakistan and India in the south. The province has two airports, one is the Herat International Airport in the capital of Herat and the other is at the Shindand Air Base, which is one of the largest military bases in Afghanistan. The Salma Dam which is fed by the Hari River is also located in this province.

==History==
The region of Herat was historically part of Greater Khorasan, which was successively controlled by the Tahirids followed by the Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Ilkhanids, Timurids, Safavids, Hotakis, Afsharids, Durranis, Qajarids until it became part of the modern state of Afghanistan.

During the 19th century, the British arrived from southern Afghanistan as part of the &quot;Great Game&quot; and backed up the Afghans during one Persian siege and one capture of the city, the former in 1838, and the latter in 1856 in order to prevent Persian or Russian influence reaching deeper in South Asia, and also, more importantly, to protect Britain&#x27;s colony in India as part of the Great Game. The situation in the province then remained quiet and uneventful until the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

The province saw a number of battles during the 1980s Soviet war, and remained an active area of guerrilla warfare throughout, with local mujahideen commander Ismail Khan leading resistance against the Soviet-backed Afghan government. This continued until the Soviet Union withdrew all its forces in 1989.

When the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, Ismail Khan became the governor of the province, a position he retained until the Taliban forces from the south took control of the province in 1995. Following the ousting of the Taliban and establishment of the Karzai administration in late 2001, led by Hamid Karzai, Ismail Khan once again became governor of Herat.

Ismail Khan become a figure of controversy when the media began reporting that he was attempting to restrict freedom of the people, and that he was becoming more of an independent ruler as a warlord. He lost a son Mirwais Sadiq in 2004 during a fight with forces of other warlords. In response to this, the central government began expanding into the province with the newly trained Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). Ismail Khan was ordered to leave his post to become a minister and live in Kabul.

After 2005, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) established a presence in the area to help assist the Afghan government. It was led by Italy. A multi-national Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) was also established to help the local population of the province. The United States established a consulate in Herat, trained Afghan security forces, and built schools and clinics.

Herat was one of the first seven areas that transitioned security responsibility from NATO to Afghanistan. On 21 July 2011, Afghan security forces assumed lead security responsibility from NATO. On the occasion, Minister of Defence Wardak told the audience, &quot;this is our national responsibility to take over our security and defend our country.&quot;

In 2023, Herat was heavily impacted by two major earthquakes, one of which was 6.3-magnitude earthquake, and the other an aftershock. Combined, the earthquakes killed over 2,800 and injured thousands more in the province. It has been called Afghanistan&#x27;s worst earthquake since 1998. Herat was hit by a third earthquake of 6.3 magnitude in just over a week. It killed 2 people and injured almost 150.

==Economy==
The province is home to 90% of Afghanistan&#x27;s Saffron production (a $12 million industry in 2014). In 2015 the World Bank noted that saffron cultivation had provided Herat Province&#x27;s farmers a steady source of income, jobs for both men and women, and a decreased dependency on poppy cultivation.

With international borders to Iran and Turkmenistan and an international airport, trade could potentially play an important part in the economy of Herat Province. Due to the lack of urbanization in Herat Province, around 75% of the population lives in rural areas and economic activity is correspondingly heavily reliant on agriculture and horticulture production (saffron, rugs, cumin, marble, animal skins and wool) with around 82% of economic activity coming from these fields in 2011. Marble manufacturing and light industry comprised the remaining areas of economic activity.

==Healthcare==
The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 31% in 2005 to 28% in 2011. The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 24% in 2005 to 25% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 36% in 2005 to 25% in 2011. The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 55% in 2005 to 52% in 2011. Herat University is Afghanistan&#x27;s second largest university with over 10,000 students, 14 faculties and 45 departments in 2014.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the total population of the province is about 2,187,169, the majority of which live in rural parts. According to Afghanistan&#x27;s Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development:

===Population by districts===

The province is divided into 16 districts and contains over 1,000 villages.


==Sport==

Football is the popular sport in Herat Province, and in recent years cricket is also growing in popularity. The Province is represented in domestic competitions by the Herat Province cricket team. Afghanistan&#x27;s national sport Buzkashi and a number of other sports are also played in the region.

==Notable people==
*Abbas the Great – Safavid ruler
*Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqara – Timurid ruler of Herat
*Mirwais Hotak – founder of the Hotak dynasty
*Ismail Khan – Tajik Commander of Jamiat Islami
*Ahmad Shah Durrani – founder of the Durrani dynasty
*Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i – poet, writer, politician, linguist, mystic, and painter
*Faramarz Tamanna
*Zablon Simintov

==Future==
In December 2012, Afghanistan and Italy signed a &quot;long term agreement&quot; including a €150 million soft loan facility for infrastructure projects in Herat Province. In 2014 the agreement for a first soft loan worth about US$32 million was agreed for the upgrade of the Herat airport. In 2016 a second soft loan agreement worth about US$100 million was signed between Afghanistan and Italy for the construction a 155 km road between Herat and Chist-e Sharif. Italy also agreed to assess the possibility of a third soft loan worth about US$70 million for completing the railroad connection between Herat and Mashad in Iran. The Asian Development Bank is also implementing a feasibility study for the construction of a railway connection between Herat and Turkmenistan.

<text>The Scarecrow is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane, the character first appeared in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #3 (September 1941). He has since become one of the superhero Batman&#x27;s most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

In the DC Universe, the Scarecrow is the alias of Jonathan Crane, a professor of psychology turned criminal mastermind. Abused and bullied in his youth, he becomes obsessed with fear and develops a hallucinogenic drug—dubbed &quot;fear toxin&quot;—to terrorize Gotham City and exploit the phobias of its protector, Batman. As the self-proclaimed &quot;Master of Fear&quot;, the Scarecrow&#x27;s crimes do not stem from a common desire for wealth or power, but from a sadistic pleasure in subjecting others to his experiments on the manipulation of fear. An outfit symbolic of his namesake with a stitched burlap mask serves as the Scarecrow&#x27;s visual motif.

The character has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed in film by Cillian Murphy in &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;, and in television by Charlie Tahan and David W. Thompson in the Fox series &quot;Gotham&quot;, and Vincent Kartheiser in the HBO Max streaming series &quot;Titans&quot;. Henry Polic II, Jeffrey Combs, Dino Andrade, John Noble, and Robert Englund, among others, have provided the Scarecrow&#x27;s voice in animation and video games.

==Publication history==

Batman creators Bill Finger and Bob Kane introduced the Scarecrow as a new villain in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #3 (September 1941) during the Golden Age of Comic Books, in which he made only two appearances. Ichabod Crane, the protagonist of Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, was used as an inspiration for the character&#x27;s lanky appearance as well as his alter ego, Jonathan Crane.

Scarecrow was revived during the Silver Age of Comic Books by writer Gardner Fox and artist Sheldon Moldoff in &quot;Batman&quot; #189 (February 1967), which featured the debut of the character&#x27;s signature fear-inducing hallucinogen or &quot;fear toxin&quot;. The character remained relatively unchanged throughout the Bronze Age of Comic Books.

Following the 1986 multi-title event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; reboot, the character&#x27;s origin story is expanded on in &quot;Batman&quot; Annual #19 and the miniseries &quot;Batman/Scarecrow: Year One&quot;, with this narrative also revealing that Crane has a fear of bats.&lt;ref name=&quot;B/S:YO&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, as a result of The New 52 reboot, Scarecrow&#x27;s origin (as well as that of various other DC characters) is once again altered, incorporating several elements that differ from the original.

==Fictional character biography==
===Backstory===
Born in Georgia, Jonathan Crane is abused by his great-grandmother, and is bullied at school for his resemblance to Ichabod Crane from Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, sparking his lifelong obsession with fear and using it as a weapon against others, before they can use it to defeat him like his literary namesake. In his senior year, Crane is humiliated by school bully Bo Griggs and rejected by cheerleader Sherry Squires. He takes revenge during the senior prom by donning his trademark scarecrow costume and wielding a water pistol resembling a real gun in the school parking lot. In the ensuing chaos, Griggs gets into a car accident, paralyzing himself and killing Squires.

Crane&#x27;s obsession with fear leads him to become a psychologist, taking a position at Arkham Asylum and performing fear-inducing experiments on his patients. He is also a professor of psychology at Gotham University, specializing in the study of phobias. He loses his job after he fires a gun inside a packed classroom, accidentally wounding a student; he takes revenge by killing the professors responsible for his termination and becomes a career criminal.

As a college professor, Crane mentors a young Thomas Elliot. The character also has a cameo in &quot;Sandman&quot; (vol. 2) #5. In stories by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale, the Scarecrow is depicted as one of the more deranged criminals in Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery, with a habit of speaking in nursery rhymes. These stories further revise his history, explaining that he was raised by his abusive, fanatically religious great-grandfather, whom he murdered as a teenager.

===Criminal career===

Scarecrow plays a prominent role in Doug Moench&#x27;s &quot;Terror&quot; storyline, set in Batman&#x27;s early years, where Professor Hugo Strange breaks him out of Arkham and gives him &quot;therapy&quot; to train him to defeat Batman. Strange&#x27;s therapy proves effective enough to turn the Scarecrow against his &quot;benefactor&quot;, impaling him on a weather vane and throwing him in the cellar of his own mansion. The Scarecrow then uses Strange&#x27;s mansion to lure Batman to Crime Alley, and decapitates one of his former classmates in the alley in front of Batman. With the help of Catwoman, — whom Scarecrow had attempted to blackmail into helping him by capturing her and photographing her unmasked— Batman catches Scarecrow, but loses sight of Strange, with it being unclear whether Strange had actually survived the fall onto the weather vane, or if Scarecrow and Batman are hallucinating from exposure to Scarecrow&#x27;s fear toxin.

Scarecrow appears in &quot;&quot;, first seen escaping from Arkham on Mother&#x27;s Day with help from Carmine Falcone, who also helps the Mad Hatter escape. The Scarecrow gases Batman with fear toxin as he escapes, causing Batman to flee to his parents&#x27; grave as Bruce Wayne, where he is arrested by Commissioner Jim Gordon due to Wayne&#x27;s suspected ties to Falcone. Scarecrow robs a bank with the Mad Hatter on Independence Day for Falcone, but is stopped by Batman and Catwoman. He later appears in Falcone&#x27;s office on Halloween with Batman&#x27;s future rogue&#x27;s gallery, but is defeated by Batman. Scarecrow returns in &quot;&quot; as part of Two-Face&#x27;s gang, and is first seen putting fear gas in children&#x27;s dolls on Christmas Eve. He is eventually defeated by Batman. He later appears as one of the villains present at Calendar Man&#x27;s trial. It is revealed he and Calendar Man had been manipulating Falcone&#x27;s son Alberto; Scarecrow had determined that Alberto feared his father, and poisoned his cigarettes with the fear toxin to bring out the fear; Calendar Man, meanwhile, had been talking to Alberto, with the fear toxin making Alberto hear his father&#x27;s voice. Together, they manipulate Alberto into making an unsuccessful assassination attempt on his sister, Sofia Gigante. After Two-Face&#x27;s hideout is attacked, Batman captures Scarecrow, who tells him where Two-Face is heading. In &quot;&quot;, Scarecrow supplies the Riddler with fear gas to manipulate Catwoman, and later aids Riddler when he fights Catwoman in Rome. Scarecrow accidentally attacks Cheetah with his scythe before Catwoman knocks him out.

The Scarecrow appears in such story arcs as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, first teaming with the Joker to ransom off the mayor of Gotham City. Batman foils their plan and forces them to retreat. Scarecrow betrays Joker by spraying him with fear gas, but it has no effect; Joker then beats Scarecrow senseless with a chair. Scarecrow later tries to take over Gotham with an army of hypnotized college students, commanding them to spread his fear toxin all over the city. His lieutenant is the son of the first man he killed. He is confronted by both Batman-Azrael and Anarky and tries to escape by forcing his lieutenant to jump off of a building. Batman-Azrael knocks him out, and Anarky manages to save the boy. Despite his criminal history, he is still recognized as a skilled psychologist. When Aquaman needs insight into a serial killer operating in his new city of Sub Diego—San Diego having been sunk and the inhabitants turned into water-breathers by a secret organization—he consults with Scarecrow for insight into the pattern of the killer&#x27;s crimes. Scarecrow determined that killer chose his victims by the initials of their first and last names to spell out the message &quot;I can&#x27;t take it any more&quot;, allowing Aquaman to determine both the true identity and final target of the real killer.

In &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot;, the Scarecrow temporarily allies with the Marvel Universe Scarecrow to capture Lois Lane before they are both defeated by Ben Reilly.
In the 2004 story arc &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot;, Scarecrow is hired by the Penguin under false pretenses. Dr. Linda Friitawa then secretly mutates Scarecrow into a murderous creature known as the &quot;Scarebeast&quot;, who Penguin uses to kill off his disloyal minions. The character&#x27;s later appearances all show him as an unmutated Crane again, except for an appearance during the &quot;&quot; story arc. Scarecrow appears in the third issue of &quot;War Games&quot; saving Black Mask from Batman and acting as the crime lord&#x27;s ally, until Black Mask uses him to disable a security measure in the Clock Tower by literally throwing Scarecrow at it. Scarecrow wakes up, transforms into Scarebeast, and wreaks havoc outside the building trying to find and kill Black Mask. The police are unable to take it down, and allow Catwoman, Robin, Tarantula II, and Onyx to fight Scarebeast, as Commissioner Michael Akins had told all officers to capture or kill any vigilantes, costumed criminals or &quot;masks&quot; they find. Even they cannot defeat the Scarebeast, though he appears to have been defeated after the Clock Tower explodes.

The Scarecrow reappears alongside other Batman villains in &quot;Gotham Underground&quot;; first among the villains meeting at the Iceberg Lounge to be captured by the Suicide Squad. Scarecrow escapes by gassing Bronze Tiger with fear toxin. He later appears warning the Ventriloquist II, Firefly, Killer Moth and Lock-Up, who are planning to attack the Penguin that Penguin is allied with the Suicide Squad. The villains wave off his warnings and mock him. He later leads the same four into a trap orchestrated by Tobias Whale. Killer Moth, Firefly and Lock-Up all survive, but are injured and unconscious to varying degrees, the Scarface puppet is &quot;killed&quot;, and Peyton Reily, the new Ventriloquist, is unharmed, though after the attack she is taken away by Whale&#x27;s men. Whale then betrays Scarecrow simply for touching his shoulder (it is revealed Whale has a pathological hatred of &quot;masks&quot; because his grandfather was one of the first citizens of Gotham killed by a masked criminal). The story arc ends with Whale beating Scarecrow up and leaving him bound and gagged, as a sign to all &quot;masks&quot; that they are not welcome in Whale&#x27;s new vision of Gotham.

Scarecrow appears in &quot;&quot;, working for the Riddler and Hush. He composes profiles on the various villains of Gotham so Riddler and Hush can manipulate them to their own ends. He later gases Huntress with his fear gas, making her attack Catwoman. He attacks Batman in a graveyard, only to learn his fear gas is ineffective (due to Hush&#x27;s bug), but before he can reveal this he is knocked out by Jason Todd. Scarecrow also appears in &quot;Batman: Heart of Hush&quot;, kidnapping a child to distract Batman so Hush can attack Catwoman. When Batman goes to rescue the child, Scarecrow activates a Venom implant, causing the boy to attack Batman. He is defeated when Batman ties the boy&#x27;s teddy bear to Scarecrow, causing the child to attack Scarecrow. After capturing Scarecrow, Batman forces him to reveal Hush&#x27;s location. In the &quot;&quot; storyline, Scarecrow is recruited by a new Black Mask to be a part of a group of villains who are aiming to take over Gotham in the wake of Batman&#x27;s apparent death. He later assists the crime lord in manufacturing a recreational drug called &quot;Thrill,&quot; which draws the attention of Oracle and Batgirl. He is later defeated by Batgirl and once again arrested.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
Scarecrow briefly appears in the fourth issue of the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline. His immunity to fear (brought about by frequent exposure to his own fear toxin) renders him practically invisible to the invading Black Lanterns. The drug has taken a further toll on his sanity, exacerbated by Batman&#x27;s disappearance in the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; storyline; he develops a literal addiction to fear, exposing himself deliberately to the revenant army, but knowing that only Batman could scare him again. Using a duplicate of Sinestro&#x27;s power ring, he is temporarily deputized into the Sinestro Corps to combat the Black Lanterns. Overjoyed at finally being able to feel fear again, Scarecrow gleefully and without question follows Sinestro&#x27;s commands. His celebration is cut short when Lex Luthor, overwhelmed by the orange light of Avarice, steals his ring.

===&quot;Brightest Day&quot;===
In &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Scarecrow begins kidnapping and murdering college interns working for LexCorp as a way of getting back at Lex Luthor for stealing his ring. When Robin and Supergirl attempt to stop him, Scarecrow unleashes a new fear toxin that is powerful enough to affect a Kryptonian. The toxin forces Supergirl to see visions of a Black Lantern Reactron, but she is able to snap out of the illusion and help Robin defeat Scarecrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/B #77&quot;&gt;&quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #77. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He is eventually freed from Arkham when Deathstroke and the Titans break into the asylum to capture one of the inmates.

===The New 52===

In 2011, The New 52 rebooted the DC universe. Scarecrow is a central villain in the Batman family of books and first appeared in the New 52 in &quot;&quot; #4 (February 2012), written by David Finch and Paul Jenkins. His origin story is also altered; in this continuity, his father Gerald Crane used him as a test subject in his fear-based experiments. During one of these experiments, Crane&#x27;s father locked him inside a little dark room, but suffered a fatal heart attack before he could let Jonathan out. Jonathan was trapped in the test chamber for days until being freed by some employers of the university. As a result of this event, he was irreparably traumatized and developed an obsession with fear. He became a psychologist, specializing in phobias. Eventually, Crane began using patients as test subjects for his fear toxin. His turn to criminality is also markedly different in this version; the New 52 Scarecrow is fired from his professorship for covering an arachnophobic student with spiders, and becomes a criminal after stabbing a patient to death.

The Scarecrow kidnaps Poison Ivy, and works with Bane to create and distribute to various Arkham inmates a new form of Venom infused with the Scarecrow&#x27;s fear toxin. With the help of Superman and the Flash, Batman defeats the villains. The Scarecrow surfaces again in &quot;&quot; #10, penned by Gregg Hurwitz, for a six-issue arc. The Scarecrow kidnaps Commissioner James Gordon and several children, and eventually releases his fear toxin into the atmosphere. Scarecrow is also used as a pawn by the Joker in the &quot;Death of the Family&quot; arc; he is referred to as Batman&#x27;s physician. Scarecrow appears in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (vol. 5) #19 (June 2013), clipping flowers for his toxins at the Metropolis Botanical Garden. Swamp Thing attempts to save Scarecrow from cutting a poisonous flower, not realizing who the villain is. Scarecrow attempts to use his fear toxin on Swamp Thing. The toxin causes Swamp Thing to lose control of his powers until Superman intervenes. He is later approached by the Outsider of the Secret Society of Super Villains to join up with the group. Scarecrow accepts the offer.

As part of &quot;Villains Month&quot;, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #23.3 (Sept. 2013) was titled &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; #1. Scarecrow goes to see Killer Croc, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Riddler and informs them of a war at Blackgate Penitentiary is coming and learns where each of the alliances lives. Through his conversations with each, Scarecrow learns that Bane may be the cause of the Blackgate uprising and will be their leader in the impending war. It was also stated that Talons from the Court of Owls were stored at Blackgate on ice. Later, looking over the divided city, Scarecrow claims that once the war is over and the last obstacle has fallen, Gotham City would be his. Scarecrow approaches Professor Pyg at Gotham Memorial Hospital to see if he will give his supplies and Dollotrons to Scarecrow&#x27;s followers. Scarecrow goes to Penguin next, who has already planned for the impending war, by blowing up the bridges giving access to Gotham City. Scarecrow and Man-Bat attempt to steal the frozen Talons from Blackgate while Penguin is having a meeting with Bane. Killer Croc rescues Scarecrow and Man-Bat from Blackgate and brings Scarecrow to Wayne Tower, where he gives Killer Croc control of Wayne Tower, as it no longer suits him. Scarecrow begins waking the Talons in his possession, having doused them with his fear gas and using Mad Hatter&#x27;s mind-control technology in their helmets to control them. At Arkham Asylum, Scarecrow senses that he has lost the Talons after Bane freed them from Mad Hatter&#x27;s mind-control technology. Scarecrow then turns to his next plan, giving the other inmates a small dose of Bane&#x27;s Venom to temporarily transform them. Upon Bane declaring that Gotham City is finally his, he has Scarecrow hanged between two buildings.

In &quot;Batman and Robin Eternal&quot;, flashbacks reveal that Scarecrow was the first villain faced by Dick Grayson as Robin in the New 52 universe when his and Batman&#x27;s investigations into Scarecrow&#x27;s crimes lead Batman to Mother, a woman who believes that tragedy and trauma serve as &#x27;positive&#x27; influences to help people become stronger. To this end, Mother has Scarecrow develop a new style of fear toxin that makes the brain suffer the same experience as witnessing a massive trauma, but Scarecrow turns against Mother as the victims of this plan would become incapable of feeling anything. Recognizing that Mother will kill him once he has outlived his usefulness, Scarecrow attempts to turn himself over to Batman, but Batman uses this opportunity to have him deliver a fake psychological profile of him to Mother, claiming that Batman is a scarred child terrified of losing the people he cares for to make Mother think she understands him. In the present day, as Mother unleashes a new hypnotic signal to take control of the world&#x27;s children, the Bat-Family abduct Scarecrow to brew up a new batch of his trauma toxin after determining that it nullifies the controlling influence of Mother&#x27;s signal until they can shut down her main base.

===DC Rebirth===
In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Scarecrow works with the Haunter to release a low dose of fear toxin around Gotham on Christmas and sets up a small stand for her to pick up the toxin. Both he and Haunter are paralyzed by the toxin&#x27;s effects, allowing Batman to apprehend them. The Scarecrow later emerges using a Sinestro Corps power ring to induce fear and rage against Batman in random citizens throughout Gotham, to the point where he provokes Alfred Pennyworth into threatening to shoot Simon Baz as part of his final assault. In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Scarecrow is among the villains who meet with the Riddler to discuss the Superman Theory. Wanting to take on villains outside his rogues gallery, Shazam flies to Gotham City where he hears about a hostage situation caused by Scarecrow. Shazam starts to fight him when he begins to get affected by the fear gas. Batman shows up and regains control of the situation by defeating Scarecrow and administering the antidote. As Scarecrow is arrested, Batman states to Shazam that Scarecrow is too dangerous for him to fight.

===Infinite Frontier===
During &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, a re-designed Crane is the main foe of the crossover &quot;Fear State&quot;.

==Characterization==
===Skills and equipment===
A master strategist and manipulator, his genius labels him as one of the most cunning criminal masterminds. Crane is a walking textbook on anxiety disorders and psychoactive drugs; he is able to recite the name and description of nearly every known phobia. He is even known to have a frightening ability to tamper with anyone&#x27;s mind with just words, once managing to drive two men to suicide, and uses this insight to find people&#x27;s mental pressure points and exploit them. Despite his scrawny build, Crane is a skilled martial artist who uses his long arms and legs in his personal combat style known as &quot;violent dancing&quot;, developed during his training in the Kung Fu style of the White Crane, for which Scarecrow sometimes wields a sickle or scythe.

Scarecrow also has proficiency in both biochemistry and toxicology, both important to the invention of his fear toxin, which he atomized with mixed chemicals, including powerful synthetic adrenocortical secretions and other potent hallucinogens that can be inhaled or injected into the bloodstream to amplify the victim&#x27;s darkest fear into a terrifying hallucination. Its potency has upgraded to an extreme level over the years; in some stories in which it appears, fear toxin is depicted as capable of prompting almost instantaneous, terror-induced heart attacks, leaving the victim in a permanent psychosis of chronic fear. Other versions of the toxin are powerful enough that even Superman can be affected; in one story, he mixes the toxin with kryptonite to simultaneously weaken and terrify the Man of Steel. To instill his toxin, he often uses a hand-held sprayer in the shape of a human skull and special straws which can be snapped in half to release it. In one story, Scarecrow concocts a chemical containing wildfowl pheromones from his childhood that causes nearby birds to attack his opponents.

===Powers and abilities===
In the story arc &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot;, after being secretly mutated by Dr. Linda Friitawa, Scarecrow gains the ability to turn into a large, monstrous creature called the Scarebeast. As Scarebeast, he has greatly enhanced strength, endurance, and emits a powerful fear toxin from his body. However, he has to be under physical strain or duress to transform. During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; mini-series, Scarecrow is temporarily deputized into the Sinestro Corps by a duplicate of Sinestro&#x27;s Power ring. He proves to be very capable in manipulating the light of fear to create constructs until his ring is stolen by Lex Luthor.

===Personality===
Crane, in almost all of his incarnations, is cruel, sadistic, deranged, and manipulative above all else. Crane is obsessed with fear, and takes sadistic pleasure in frightening his victims, often literally to death, with his fear toxin. Crane also suffers from brain damage from prolonged exposure to his own toxin that renders him nearly incapable of being afraid of anything - except Batman. This is problematic for him, as he is addicted to fear and compulsively seeks out confrontations with Batman to feed his addiction. He is also known to have a warped sense of humor, though not to the level of Black Mask or the Joker, as he has been known to frequently make taunts and quips related to his using his fear toxin or his love of terrifying others. During Alan Grant&#x27;s &quot;The God of Fear&quot; storyline, Scarecrow develops a god complex; he creates an enormous hologram of himself that he projects against the sky, so he will be recognized and worshipped by the citizens of Gotham as a literal god of fear.

==Other characters named Scarecrow==
===Madame Crow===
Abigail O&#x27;Shay is a Gotham University student who writes her doctoral thesis on vigilantes like the Bat-Family, whom she calls the &quot;cape and cowl crowd&quot;. She is fascinated by the kind of trauma a person would have to go through to fight criminals while in costume. She learns about such trauma first hand when Jonathan Crane, then uses her as the test subject in experiments using his fear toxin, intending to test its readiness for use on Batman. She spends more than a year in Arkham Asylum recuperating from Scarecrow&#x27;s experiments. Blaming Batman for her trauma, O&#x27;Shay adopted the identity of Madame Crow with the intention of making sure no one would feel the kind of fear she did ever again as she becomes a member of the Victim Syndicate. In a reversal to Scarecrow&#x27;s fear toxin, Madame Crow has a set of gauntlets that fire needles filled with &quot;anti-fear&quot; toxin, which removes fear in the hope of keeping people from fighting to avoid their own trauma.

==Alternative versions==
As one of Batman&#x27;s most recognizable and popular opponents, the Scarecrow appears in numerous comics that are not considered part of the regular DC continuity, including:

* The Scarecrow appears in the crossover &quot;Batman/Daredevil: King of New York&quot;, in which he attempts to use the Kingpin&#x27;s criminal empire to disperse his fear gas over New York City. He is defeated when Daredevil, the &quot;Man Without Fear&quot;, proves immune to the gas.
* The Scarecrow is featured in part two of the four-part in &quot;&quot;. This version of Scarecrow is portrayed as a German agent who kills a contact working for the Bat (Batman), the Clock (Hourman), and the Owl (Doctor Mid-Nite). In a struggle with Scarecrow, the fiancée of the agent Terry Sloane is killed. This causes Sloane to return to the field as Mister Terrific and kill Scarecrow.
* A stand-in for Jonathan Crane named Jenna Clarke / Scarecrone appears in the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; original graphic novel &quot;&quot; as a henchwoman/consort under the employ of Vandal Savage. Scarecrone also acts as a stand-in for Two-Face. She has the power to invade a person&#x27;s psyche and make their deepest fears appear as illusions simply by touching them. &quot;Scarecrone&quot; is actually her alternate personality. Vandal Savage requires Clarke to switch to her Scarecrone persona through a special formula that he has made Clarke dependent on. The two personalities are antagonistic towards each other. It is revealed that when the formula brings out Scarecrone, the right side of her face becomes heavily scarred. This scarring is healed once the formula wears off and the Jenna Clarke personality becomes dominant again.
* The Scarecrow is one of the main characters in Alex Ross&#x27; maxi-series &quot;Justice&quot; as part of the Legion of Doom. He is first seen out of costume in a hospital, injecting a girl in a wheelchair with a serum allowing her to walk. Scarecrow is later seen in costume during Lex Luthor&#x27;s speech alongside Clayface inside the home of Black Canary and Green Arrow. Scarecrow gases Canary while Clayface attacks Green Arrow, but the attack fails when Black Canary finds her husband attacked by Clayface. Green Arrow defeats Clayface by electrocuting him with a lamp, and the duo flee soon after Canary unleashes her Canary Cry. Scarecrow is later seen with Clayface and Parasite, having captured Commissioner James Gordon, Batgirl, and Supergirl. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, Scarecrow does not appear to face any particular target and duels the League as a whole. He is one of the few villains to escape the League&#x27;s initial attack. The Justice League follows Scarecrow to his city, whereupon he sends his city&#x27;s population to attack the League, knowing that they would not hurt civilians. However, John Stewart&#x27;s ring frees the city from Scarecrow&#x27;s control, subsequently freeing Scarecrow from Brainiac&#x27;s control. Scarecrow does not seem bothered by this realization, admitting he would have done it anyway. He causes a diversion by releasing his fear gas into his entire city, driving his citizens into a homicidal frenzy, and manages to escape capture, but he is ambushed and nearly killed by the Joker in retaliation for not having been invited to the Legion of Doom. Scarecrow&#x27;s city is again saved by the Justice League.
* The Scarecrow appears in the third and final chapter of &quot;Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain&quot;, in which he has adorned his Scarecrow costume with laces of the severed fingers of the bullies who tormented him in school. He is about to kill a former football player when vampire Batman appears, noting that Scarecrow is worse than him; as a vampire, he is driven to kill by forces beyond his control, while Scarecrow chooses to be a murderer. Batman then grabs Scarecrow&#x27;s vial of fear gas, crushing it along with the supervillain&#x27;s hand, and cuts Scarecrow&#x27;s head off with his own sickle, declaring that Scarecrow has no idea what fear really is.
* In the New 52 &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; books that takes place after &quot;Futures End&quot;, the future Batman/Terry McGinnis fights a new, female version of the Scarecrow named Adalyn Stern. As a child, Adalyn was traumatized when she witnessed Batman brutally beat up her father (who was a notorious gang leader). She was placed in institutional care until she was assigned to one of Jonathan Crane&#x27;s disciples who attempted to treat her with technology derived from Crane&#x27;s work, which only amplified her fear of Batman. She grows up and becomes a co-anchor to Jack Ryder on the New 52. She uses A.I. cubes placed in everyone&#x27;s homes to brainwash the population into believing that the new Batman is a demon that needs to be put down. She is eventually defeated by the combined efforts of the original and new Batman as well as Jack Ryder and is institutionalized in Arkham Asylum afterward when she views herself as nothing but the Scarecrow.
* In the alternate timeline of &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, Scarecrow is one of the many villains subsequently killed by Thomas Wayne, who is that universe&#x27;s Batman.
* In the graphic novel &quot;&quot;, Dr. Jonathan Crane is mentioned as the head of the Crane Institute for the Criminally Insane, and one of its escapees is one Ray Salinger, also known as the &quot;Birthday Boy&quot;, used by Mayor Cobblepot to his advantages.
* In &quot;Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; crossover, the Scarecrow appears mutated into a raven as one of the various other Arkham inmates mutated by Shredder and the Foot Clan to attack Batman and Robin. Batman is captured, but Robin manages to escape. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Splinter then arrive, where Splinter defeats the mutated villains, while Batman uses his new Intimidator Armor to defeat Shredder and the Turtles defeat Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Later, Jim Gordon tells Batman that the police scientists have managed to turn all of the inmates at Arkham back to normal, and that they are currently in A.R.G.U.S. custody.
* Scarecrow makes a minor appearance in the 2017 series &quot;&quot;. Crane, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a Joker who had been force-fed an overdose of pills by Batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from Clayface&#x27;s body. This was done so that Napier, who was using Mad Hatter&#x27;s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface&#x27;s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Scarecrow and the other villains are then used to attack a library which Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of Gotham City&#x27;s poorer districts. Later on in the story, the control hat is stolen by Neo-Joker (the second Harley Quinn, who felt that Jack Napier was a pathetic abnormality while Joker was the true, beautiful personality), in an effort to get Napier into releasing the Joker persona. Scarecrow also appears in the sequel storyline &quot;&quot;, being among the villains murdered by Azrael.
* The Scarecrow makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot;.
* Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow is one of the main antagonists in the &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot; series &quot;Echoes&quot;.

<doc id="312565" wikidata="Q11415433" url="?curid=312565" title="Meisho">
<text>originally referred to sites in Japan famous for their associations with specific poetic or literary references. With the development of woodblock printing and newer styles of tourism during the Edo period, the term came to denote a wider range of places of interest.

==Literary meisho==

Used in conjunction with &quot;utamakura&quot;, &quot;meisho&quot; add layers of allusion to poetry and literary and dramatic works which would not otherwise be present. 

Many of the most famous &quot;meisho&quot; derive from references in the Genji Monogatari, Heike Monogatari, and Ise Monogatari. In addition to being referenced in poetry and literature, &quot;meisho&quot; very often make appearances in Noh, kabuki, and jōruri theatre, and in ukiyo-e and other visual art forms.

One example is that of the &quot;miyakodori&quot;, or &quot;birds of the capital&quot;, originally referenced in the &quot;Ise monogatari&quot;. As most &quot;meisho&quot; derive from Heian era source, this is among the very few which related to the Edo/Tokyo area. The protagonist of the &quot;monogatari&quot;, having been exiled from Kyoto, finds his way to the Sumidagawa in what is today Tokyo; at a particular point in the river, he spots a particular type of plovers which he has not seen before. Asking the boatman what kind of bird they are, he receives the reply that they are &quot;miyakodori&quot;, &quot;capital birds,&quot; which makes him long for the capital and weep, asking the birds what they know of events in Kyoto.

This episode was later referenced in the Noh play &quot;Sumidagawa&quot;, in which a woman journeys to the region seeking her kidnapped son. Her boatman does not know the name of the birds, and she reprimands him for not being more cultured and knowing that they are &quot;miyakodori&quot;. Once the Tokugawa shogunate was established at Edo in 1603, this spot on the river where the birds were said to be found became a very popular site for restaurants and other forms of entertainment. Many people would stop here and ponder the poetic resonances, or just enjoy seeing a famous site, while on their way upriver to the Yoshiwara. The spot also appeared frequently in &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; representations of famous sites or famous restaurants in the capital.

Another keen example is that of Suma shore, a beach near modern-day Kobe, where one episode of the Tale of Genji took place. The battle of Ichi-no-Tani, related in the Tale of the Heike, also took place there, and thus many of the Noh, jōruri and kabuki plays which involve that battle, such as &quot;Atsumori&quot; and &quot;Ichi-no-tani Futaba Gunki&quot;, make reference, either outright or silently implied, to the poetic associations of Genji&#x27;s episode there.

==Popularization of meisho==

With the development of woodblock printing in Japan and newer styles of tourism during the Edo period (including literary tourism), the use of the term &quot;meisho&quot; broadened considerably. 

Meisho were featured in various types of books, including travel guides as well as travelogues and regional histories, with names such as &quot;Edo meisho zue&quot; (Illustrated famous Edo places, 1834) and &quot;Owari meisho zue&quot; (Illustrated famous Owari places). 
Meisho also provided a popular subject for numerous series of ukiyoe prints such as the famous &quot;One Hundred Famous Views of Edo&quot;, a late series by Hiroshige completed by Hiroshige II between 1856 and 1859.

<text>The Sea Organization or Sea Org is the senior-most status of staff within the Church of Scientology network of corporations, but is not itself incorporated. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Sea Org was started as L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s private navy, and adopted naval uniforms and ranks. Today, all Scientology management organizations are exclusively staffed with Sea Org members. The Sea Org maintains strict codes for its members, beginning with a billion-year pledge of service to Scientology upon initiation. David Miscavige, the leader of Scientology, is the highest-ranking Sea Org officer with the rank of captain. The higher rank of commodore is permanently reserved for the reincarnation of the late L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology. Some ex-members and scholars have described the Sea Org as a totalitarian organization marked by intensive surveillance and lack of freedom.
In a 1992 memorandum by the Church of Scientology International, the following information was provided to the Internal Revenue Service with regards to the nature of the Sea Org:
== History ==

The Sea Org was established on August 12, 1967, by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Dianetics and Scientology, initially aboard three ships, the &quot;Avon River&quot;, the &quot;Enchanter&quot;, and &quot;HMS Royal Scotsman&quot;. Hubbard later rechristened the three vessels the &quot;Diana&quot;, the &quot;Athena&quot;, and the &quot;Apollo&quot;. The Apollo served as the flagship, or simply called &quot;Flag&quot;, and Hubbard was referred to as Commodore.

In 1971, the Sea Org assumed responsibility for the delivery of the upper levels of its auditing and training, known as the Operating Thetan or &quot;OT&quot; levels. In 1981, under the aegis of the Commodore&#x27;s Messenger Organization led by David Miscavige, Sea Org members dissolved the Guardian&#x27;s Office (GO) and assumed full responsibility for the church&#x27;s international management, later reassigning the GO&#x27;s duties to the Office of Special Affairs in 1983 during the corporate restructuring of the Church.

It moved to land-based organizations in 1975, though maritime customs persist, with many members wearing naval-style uniforms and addressing both male and female officers as &quot;sir&quot;. In 1985, the church purchased a motor vessel, the &quot;Freewinds&quot;, which docks in Curaçao in the southern Caribbean and is used as a religious retreat and training center, staffed entirely by Sea Org members. Sea Org members make a lifetime commitment to Scientology by signing a billion-year contract officially described as a symbolic pledge. In exchange, they are given free room and board, as well as a small weekly allowance. Sea Org members agree to strict codes of discipline, such as disavowing premarital sex, working long hours (on average at least 100 hours per week) and living in communal housing called berthing. They are allowed to marry, but must leave the Sea Org if they have or want to raise children.

==Background==

According to Hubbard, much of the galaxy, including Earth (known as &quot;Teegeeack&quot;), was ruled tens of millions of years ago by the Galactic Confederacy. The confederacy was controlled by Xenu, a tyrant who was eventually overthrown by a group within the Galactic Confederacy known as the &quot;Loyal Officers&quot;. Religious scholar Hugh Urban writes that the Sea Org is modeled after these Loyal Officers. Urban also describes the Sea Org, with the naval uniforms and ranks, as an idealized re-creation of Hubbard&#x27;s own World War II military career. He says the Sea Org is reminiscent of the &quot;Soldiers of Light&quot; in Hubbard&#x27;s science fiction story collection &quot;Ole Doc Methuselah&quot;. The publicized goal of the Sea Org is to &quot;get ethics in on the planet&quot;.

Academic Stephen A. Kent has argued that at least part of the reason for the establishment of the Sea Org was that the Church of Scientology&#x27;s practices encountered resistance from the American Food and Drug Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, as well as from the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, and Rhodesia. Sailing on the high seas meant the church could escape their attention.

In 2000 the number of Sea Org members was listed at around 5,800. Most Sea Org members reside in church complexes in Los Angeles, Clearwater, Copenhagen, London, Saint Hill, and Sydney, with some at smaller centers or on assignment elsewhere. According to reports filed with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission in 2022, the Church of Scientology Religious Education College Incorporated, Scientology&#x27;s UK arm, claimed to have a total of 700 &quot;volunteers&quot; (including Sea Org) across Saint Hill, London, Manchester, Birmingham and other UK organizations.

According to scholar Susan Raine, Hubbard created the Sea Org as a &quot;kind of space navy, melding [sci-fi] space ideas with Earthbound naval ones.&quot; Hubbard biographer Jon Atack recalled a confidential Sea Org executive directive that claimed that governments of the world were on the verge of collapse: &quot;The Sea Org would survive and pick up the pieces.&quot;

==Structure==

Sea Org Day is August 12, when ceremonies are held to commemorate the achievements and contributions of Sea Org members, and when rank and promotion ceremonies take place.

High Winds is the magazine of the Sea Org. The first issue was released on Sea Org Day 1980.

===Estates Project Force===
All new recruits are required to complete compulsory novitiate before they are allowed to join the Sea Org, which has been described as a boot camp. During this phase, known as the Estates Project Force (EPF), recruits are not considered full Sea Org members. They are required to address all members as &quot;sir&quot;, regardless of rank, and must run everywhere instead of walking. Married couples are separated for the duration of the EPF and not allowed to have private or intimate contact with each other.

While on the EPF, recruits are assigned an intensive daily regimen divided between five hours of manual labor and five hours of study and indoctrination known as &quot;Product Zero&quot;. Scientology courses required to complete the EPF include:
*&quot;Basic Study Manual&quot;, an introductory course in Study Technology, a simplified version of the &quot;Student Hat&quot; course.
*&quot;Introduction to Scientology Ethics&quot;, a basic course in Scientology ethics and justice.
*&quot;Basic Sea Org Member Hat&quot;, a course on the basics of membership in the Sea Org and what is expected.
*&quot;Welcome to the Sea Org&quot;, a series of taped lectures Hubbard originally gave new recruits in October 1969.
*&quot;Personal Grooming Course&quot;, a course on personal hygiene.
The EPF has no definite schedule. Recruits graduate from the EPF when all required courses have been completed and upon successfully undergoing a mandatory &quot;7A Security Check&quot; and approval by a &quot;Fitness Board&quot;. They may then join the Sea Org as full members. Sea Org recruits verbally agree to an 18-point code or pledge as part of a swearing in ceremony. Members formally reaffirm their acceptance of this code annually on August 12, the day the organization was founded.

===Ships and land bases===
In 1967, the Church of Scientology purchased the 1936-built ferry &quot;Royal Scotsman&quot;, which it renamed the &quot;Apollo&quot;, for use as Sea Org&#x27;s flagship. 

In 1975, the church sold the Sea Org&#x27;s ships and moved the organization to land bases around the world, which as of 2003 operated in Clearwater, Copenhagen, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Saint Hill Manor in the UK, and Sydney, with smaller offices in Budapest, Johannesburg, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, and Toronto.

In 1987, the church purchased a ship, &quot;La Bohème&quot;, which it renamed &quot;Freewinds&quot;. OT VIII, the highest auditing level of Scientology available, is exclusive to the &quot;Freewinds&quot; and can only be undertaken there. The ship also hosts various courses, seminars, conventions, and events, including the annual &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; celebration.

===Billion-year commitment===
According to Hubbard, the Sea Org&#x27;s mission is &quot;an exploration into both time &quot;and&quot; space&quot;. Sea Org members act as goodwill representatives and administrators of Scientology; all policy and administrative posts in the church&#x27;s key organizations are held by Sea Org members. Sea Org are housed in communal housing called &quot;berthing&quot;, and receive a basic allowance of about $50 per week.

In accordance with Scientology beliefs, members are expected to return to the Sea Org when they are reborn; the Sea Org&#x27;s motto is (&quot;We Come Back&quot;). Members must therefore sign a symbolic billion-year commitment, pledging to &quot;get ethics in on this planet and the universe&quot;. The church contends that the agreement is not a legally binding contract but merely a symbolic demonstration of the dedication members are expected to give to the organization, and that they are free to leave if they wish. After signing, members report to the Estates Project Force, the Sea Org&#x27;s induction program; J. Gordon Melton writes that members may take several years between signing the commitment and attending the induction. Once induction is completed, the final decision to join is made.

Members who leave the Sea Org are issued a &quot;freeloader&#x27;s bill&quot;, retroactively billing them for any auditing or training they received. Although the bill is not legally enforceable, these Scientologists may not receive services at any Scientology organization until they pay it and perform an amends program.

===Marriage and family===

From the early 1970s to the start of the 21st century, Sea Org members&#x27; children were often placed in the Cadet Org. Sea Org members may marry one another but are not permitted to marry outside the organization; extramarital sex is also prohibited. Couples with children must leave the Sea Org and return to other staff positions within the church until the child is six years old; thereafter the children are raised communally and allowed to visit their parents in the Sea Org on weekends or about an hour a day. Children of members have themselves joined the Sea Org when they came of age. Several former members have said they were advised (or even forced) to have an abortion to avoid being sent to lower organizations. Scientology presents itself as opposed to abortion and actively speaks out against it in its publications.

===Rehabilitation Project Force===

The Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) was created in January 1974 as a system of work camps set up by the Sea Org, intended to isolate and rehabilitate members who have not lived up to the church&#x27;s expectations, have failed security checks, or have violated certain policies. RPF groups are within Sea Org facilities, and there are no locks on the doors.

Many ex-Sea Org members have reported grueling treatment. On the RPF, one works eight hours of physical work six days a week, such as painting, plumbing, and upkeep of grounds. The work may involve teaching the member a skill such as carpentry. Members also spend five hours a day studying with an auditing partner. Former Scientologist Jon Atack argued, in &quot;A Piece of Blue Sky&quot; (1990), that treatment of Sea Org members in the RPF was a &quot;careful imitation of techniques long-used by the military to obtain unquestioning obedience and immediate compliance to orders, or more simply to break men&#x27;s spirits&quot;. One former member, Gerry Armstrong, said that during his time in the Sea Org in the 1970s he spent over two years banished to the RPF as a punishment:

==Analysis==
Several scholars, writers, and former members have compared the Sea Org to a paramilitary group. In &quot;Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography&quot; (2008), Andrew Morton called it a &quot;fraternal paramilitary organization&quot;, and wrote that members are instructed to read &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu, and &quot;On War&quot; by Carl von Clausewitz. He wrote that Scientology leader David Miscavige created an elite unit within the Sea Org called the &quot;SEALs&quot;, named after the United States Navy SEALs, who receive better lodging, sustenance, and uniforms than other Sea Org members.

Lawrence Wright wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2011 that the Sea Org used small children drawn from Scientology families for what he described as forced child labor. The article described extremely inhumane conditions, with children spending years in the Sea Org, sequestered from mainstream life.

<text>Jason John Bonham (born 15 July 1966) is an English drummer. He is the son of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. Since his father&#x27;s death in September 1980, he has performed with the surviving three members of Led Zeppelin on several occasions, including the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at O2 arena in London in December 2007. He has also done extensive work as a session musician, led the group Bonham in the 1980s and &#x27;90s, and is a member of the supergroups Black Country Communion and Sammy Hagar and the Circle.

==Biography and musical career==

===Early years===
Bonham could play drums skillfully at the age of five, and appeared with his father in the film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, drumming on a scaled-down kit. At 15, he joined his first band, Airrace. In 1985, he joined Virginia Wolf, making two albums and touring the US supporting the Firm.

In 1988, Bonham joined Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page for his &quot;Outrider&quot; album and tour. In May of the same year, Bonham appeared with the three surviving members of Led Zeppelin for a performance at Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert in New York City.

In 1989, Bonham appeared as a special guest at the Moscow Music Peace Festival, performing the song &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; with many major rock stars of the day. That same year, he formed his own band, Bonham, whose Zeppelin inspired first release &quot;The Disregard of Timekeeping&quot; had a hit single, &quot;Wait for You&quot; and the music video for the subsequent single &quot;Guilty&quot; did get some play; however, after a lukewarm reception for their 1992 release, &quot;Mad Hatter&quot;, the band was dissolved, and Bonham concentrated on session work and guest appearances.

On 28 April 1990, Bonham married Jan Charteris, in Stone, Worcestershire. His wedding reception included a jam with Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and John Paul Jones. The Bonhams have two children: a son named Jager and a daughter, Jaz (born 1993).

Bonham drummed for Paul Rodgers on the Grammy nominated &quot;Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters&quot; project. A year later with Slash and Paul Rodgers, he appeared at Woodstock II in 1994. Bonham reformed his band with a new lead vocalist, Marti Frederiksen, replacing Daniel MacMaster. Renamed Motherland, they released the album &quot;Peace 4 Me&quot; later in 1994; however, his down-to-earth nature always showed—on one occasion making an encore drumming appearance for local Led Zeppelin tribute bands Fred Zeppelin and Led Zepagain.

In 1995, Bonham and his sister Zoe represented their father when Led Zeppelin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Bonham soon put together another solo project that culminated in &quot;In the Name of My Father - The Zepset&quot;, which featured the songs of Led Zeppelin. Proceeds from the album went to charity. The album followed up with &quot;When You See the Sun&quot;.

Following an album and tour with his aunt Debbie Bonham, Jason Bonham was invited to drum for hard rock group UFO. In 2006, he recorded with Joe Bonamassa.

Jason Bonham also appeared in the 2001 movie &quot;Rock Star&quot;. Bonham played drummer &quot;A.C.&quot;, of the fictional band Steel Dragon. The film also featured performances by musicians such as Zakk Wylde, Jeff Pilson, Myles Kennedy, Jeff Scott Soto, Brian Vander Ark, Blas Elias, Nick Catanese, and Ralph Michael Saenz of Steel Panther. He also played on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

Bonham starred with Ted Nugent, Evan Seinfeld (Biohazard), Sebastian Bach (Skid Row), and Scott Ian (Anthrax) on the VH1 reality television show, &quot;Supergroup&quot;, in May 2006. The musicians formed a band called Damnocracy (after ditching the names FIST, God War, and Savage Animal) for the show, during which they lived in a mansion in Las Vegas for twelve days and created music. Jason also played drums live with Foreigner from 2004 to 2007 and part of 2007 to 2008.

Bonham joined the supergroup Black Country Communion with guitarist and vocalist Joe Bonamassa, vocalist and bassist Glenn Hughes and keyboardist Derek Sherinian, late in 2009 and stayed with them until they broke up in March 2013. He rejoined the group when they reformed in 2016.

===Participation in Led Zeppelin reunions===
On 14 May 1988, the Atlantic Records label held its 40th Anniversary Celebration by staging a non-stop concert lasting almost 13 hours. A reformed Led Zeppelin, with Jason on drums, closed the event.

On Saturday 28 April 1990, Jason Bonham married Jan Charteris. Later, during the wedding reception at the Heath Hotel in Bewdley, England, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and John Paul Jones joined Jason on stage and performed &quot;Custard Pie&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Me&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Sick Again&quot;, and &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; for the wedding party.
On 12 September 2007, it was announced that Jason Bonham would take over his father&#x27;s role and play drums for Led Zeppelin at the Led Zeppelin reunion concert. This took place on 10 December 2007 at London&#x27;s O2 arena as part of an all-star tribute to Ahmet Ertegun.
His performance was described as &quot;flawless&quot; by music critics.

===Jason Bonham&#x27;s Led Zeppelin Evening and other experiences===

In February 2009, Jason Bonham and James Dylan began working together in what would become Jason Bonham&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin Evening&quot;, a live homage to his late father&#x27;s band. During the autumn of 2010, Jason Bonham&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin Evening&quot; embarked on their first North American tour and toured worldwide throughout 2011.

Bonham more recently played drums, along with sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson of the group Heart on vocals and guitar respectively, with successive additions of band, string and horn sections, and choirs (including the Joyce Garrett Youth Choir) for a show-ending performance of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; during the Led Zeppelin tribute at the Kennedy Center Honors hosted by Barack Obama in December 2012 with his late father&#x27;s band members Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones in attendance. It was described as a &quot;bring down the house&quot; version.

In the Summer of 2013, Jason Bonham&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin Evening&quot; joined forces with the band Heart for &quot;The Heartbreaker Tour&quot; celebrating the music of Led Zeppelin.

Later that year, he teamed up again with Glenn Hughes to form a new rock band, which became California Breed, adding the guitarist Andrew Watt.

In 2014, Bonham joined Sammy Hagar&#x27;s supergroup Sammy Hagar and the Circle. The band featured Led Zeppelin tracks along with songs from Hagar&#x27;s various career projects, such as Montrose, Van Halen, and Chickenfoot.

From early March to late May 2015, Jason Bonham&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin Evening&quot; toured extensively in North America. On 4 December 2015, the band began their North American Winter Tour in San Jose, California. In early May 2016, they embarked on a one-month / 22-date North American tour. Most recently, they embarked on another tour throughout the United States, with dates running through November 2021. He also joined Kid Rock on his Bad Reputation Tour.

==Equipment==
===Drums===
Bonham has endorsed DW Drums. Prior to this, for many years he played a Ludwig Vistalite drumkit similar to his late father&#x27;s.

===Cymbals===

===Drumsticks===
Bonham has produced his own line of signature series drumstick with Pro-Mark. The SD531W is made of American Maple with acorn shaped, wooden tips. The taper is relatively short and the sticks have considerably large dimensions, being 16.75&quot; (42.5 cm) in length and 0.595&quot; (1.5 cm) in diameter. The sticks also feature the symbol used by Bonham&#x27;s father, John Bonham, of the three interlocking rings – they are printed next to Jason&#x27;s signature on the side of the stick.

===Other===
Bonham endorses Remo drum heads and DW drums &amp; hardware. He uses DW 9000 Series Double Pedals.

<text>The East German mark ( ), commonly called the eastern mark ( ) in West Germany and after reunification, was the currency of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Its ISO 4217 currency code was DDM. The currency was known officially as the from 1948 to 1964, from 1964 to 1967, and from 1968 to 1990 as the (Mark of the GDR). The mark (M) was divided into 100 pfennigs (pf).

==History==


=== 1948 ===
On 18 June 1948 a currency reform was announced for the western zones. Subsequently,
on 20 June 1948, the Reichsmark and the Rentenmark were abolished in the western occupation zones due to Soviet counterfeiting of &quot;AM-Marks&quot; resulting in economic instability and inflation and replaced with the &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; issued by the &quot;Bank deutscher Länder&quot; (later the Deutsche Bundesbank). Because the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; was still legal tender in the Soviet occupation zone, the currency flooded into the east from the west, where it was worthless. This caused sudden inflation, which caused privately held cash in the Soviet zone to become worthless overnight. As an emergency measure, many thousands of employees in the district offices started to affix adhesive coupons to those &quot;reichsmark&quot; and &quot;rentenmark&quot; banknotes for which the owners could prove their origin, up to a limit of per person. Only such banknotes could be exchanged when the Deutsche Notenbank (the East German counterpart of the &quot;Bundesbank&quot;) issued the new &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; with the subsequent currency reform.

Although the Soviets expressed surprise about the western currency reform at the time, the German Economic Commission, per consultation with the Soviet Military Administration had prepared for this situation. The adhesive coupons had already been printed and, with logistic assistance by the Soviets, distributed among the district offices. First affixings of the coupons started immediately, already on 19 June 1948. On 23 June 1948, the official starting day of the action, a considerable store of primed banknotes was already available. This enabled to reduce waiting times and to accelerate the process by exchanging these notes for unprimed banknotes.

On 24 July 1948, a completely new series of banknotes was issued. It maintained the official name &quot;Deutsche Mark von der Deutschen Notenbank&quot; until 1964, but it was known, especially in the west, as the &quot;Ostmark&quot;, or &quot;eastern mark&quot;.

=== 1960s ===
From 1964 to 1967, the East German mark was officially designated as the &quot;Mark der Deutschen Notenbank&quot; (MDN). With the constitutional amendments of 1968 and 1974, the leadership of East Germany moved away from the original goal of a unified Germany, using the phrase &quot;... of the GDR&quot; where earlier they would simply have said &quot;German ...&quot;. In this way the name of the currency was changed from MDN to &quot;Mark der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik (Mark der DDR)&quot; (M), or &quot;Mark of the GDR&quot;, and the name of the state bank from &quot;Deutsche Notenbank&quot; to &quot;Staatsbank der DDR&quot;. Coins minted before the renaming, with the legend &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; (i.e., in DM 1 and DM 2 denominations), continued to circulate for several years, but they were gradually replaced by the early 1980s by coins with the legend &quot;Mark&quot;.

===International exchange===

The East German mark was officially valued by the East German government at parity with the (West German) &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot;. However, due to limited convertibility and a restricted export profile, it was essentially worthless outside of East Germany. The few East Germans able to visit the West often found themselves having to rely on their West German relatives as a result.

Beginning in 1964, the East German government instituted a &quot;Zwangsumtausch&quot; (forced exchange, or &quot;Mindestumtausch&quot; – minimum exchange), whereby most visitors from non-socialist foreign countries were required to exchange a set amount of &quot;Deutsche Marks&quot; (or other hard currencies) for East German marks at the ratio of one &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; to one East German mark for every day of their stay. Starting on 13 October 1980, Western visitors to the GDR were required to exchange a minimum of DM25 for East German marks per day. Some exceptions were authorized: for example, tourists who booked hotel stays in the GDR that were paid in hard currency were exempted from the minimum exchange requirements. (Of course, such accommodation charges almost always exceeded the DM 25 daily exchange threshold.) At other times, West Berliners, retirees, children, and youth were granted either exemptions or were authorized reduced minimum exchange amounts. Members of the Western Allied military forces stationed in West Berlin were also exempt from these rules when visiting East Berlin, in part because the Western Allies did not recognize the authority of the GDR to regulate the activities of their military personnel in East Berlin; only the Soviet Union was considered competent to do so.

On the black market, the exchange rate was about 5 to 10 &quot;Mark der DDR&quot; to one &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot;. In the mid-1980s, one could easily visit foreign currency exchange offices in West Berlin and purchase East German banknotes (in denominations of 50 and 100 Mark der DDR) at the rate of M 5 (East) = DM 1 (West). The East German mark could not be spent in Intershops to acquire Western consumer goods; only hard currencies or Forum checks were accepted. As a result, the main purchasers of black market East German banknotes were Allied military personnel entering East Berlin, as they were exempt from East German customs inspection.

===Adoption of the West German &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot;===

Upon adoption of the &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; in East Germany on 1 July 1990, the East German Mark was converted at par for wages, prices and basic savings (up to a limit of M 4,000 per person, except a smaller number for children and a larger number for pensioners). Larger amounts of savings, company debts and housing loans were converted at a 2:1 rate whilst so-called &quot;speculative money&quot;, acquired shortly before unification, was converted at a rate of 3:1. These inflated exchange rates were intended by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany as a massive subsidy for eastern Germany, and remain controversial among economists, with some arguing that the exchange of currency was the most practical way of quickly unifying the German economy, and others arguing that the exchange increased the disruption caused by German unification by, among other things, making eastern German industries uncompetitive.

====Destruction of East German currency====

Around 4,500 tonnes of East German coins were melted down at the Rackwitz metal works in 1990. Almost all the paper money (about 100 billion Marks, in 620 million banknotes with a volume of , about 300 boxcars), including all the currency collected at the time of the monetary union and the never-used East German M200 and M500 banknotes, was placed into storage in 1990 and 1991 in two long sandstone caverns in the Thekenberge near Halberstadt. In total, 3,000 tonnes of banknotes, passbooks, and checks were stored there, having been brought by military convoy from the &quot;Staatsbank der DDR&quot; in Berlin. The currency became the property of the &quot;Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau&quot; (KfW) in 1994 through its merger with the &quot;Staatsbank Berlin&quot; (the post-reunification name for the &quot;Staatsbank der DDR&quot;). The tunnel system had been built by forced labour during World War II, and used by the National People&#x27;s Army under the code name &quot;Malachit&quot;, or camp complex KL-12 NVA-Nr.16/630. It was the bunker with the largest floor space, and was used for the safeguarding of devices and munitions that would be needed for war. The money was protected from theft by thick concrete walls and heavy steel doors. For cost reasons, the money was left to rot under the natural humidity, but it was further covered with gravel.

In July 2001, it was discovered that two Halberstadt residents (aged 24 and 26) had gained entry to the tunnel system through an unsecured opening and made off with numerous banknotes. The two residents were convicted of the crime and sentenced to four months in prison and three years of probation. Furthermore, they had to pay €120 to a non-profit organisation. The appearance among collectors of uncirculated M 200 and M 500 DDR notes, and of the never-issued military currency, is attributed to this theft. Because of the theft and the slowness of the rotting, the KfW then decided to burn the old currency. Between April and June 2002, 298 containers of the currency remains were burned in an incinerator (six containers per day) along with household refuse. The last container was burned on 25 June 2002.

==Coins==
The first issue of Eastern coins was released in 1948, inscribed with &quot;Deutschland&quot;, and consisted of aluminium 1pf, 5pf and 10pf denominations, depicting a wheat stalk atop a cogwheel, with aluminium-bronze 50pf coins added in 1950 depicting a factory. The 1952 series of the smaller coins depict a compass and hammer in addition to wheat.

Starting with the 1pf in 1960, followed by the 10pf in 1963, and the 5pf in 1968, the old style coins were gradually replaced with new coins depicting the state name &quot;Deutsche Demokratische Republik&quot;. Aluminium M1, M2 and 50pf pieces were released for circulation in 1956, 1957 and 1958, respectively. In 1969, brass 20pf coins were introduced, with nickel-bronze (later cupro-nickel) M5 coins issued from 1968. In 1973 and 1974, M1 and M2 coins were redesigned dropping the former &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; title. The brass 20pf coins were issued because pay telephones had a standard charge of 20pf and were having problems with aluminium coins jamming due to their light weight. Commemorative M5, M10, and M20 coins of various types have also occasionally made it into circulation. The aluminium content of the coins meant that East German coins were nicknamed &quot;alu-chips&quot;.

For several months after the July 1990 adoption of the &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot;, low-value GDR coinage (up to 50pf) continued to circulate in the former GDR as legal tender, because the &quot;Bundesbank&quot; could not deliver enough small coins quickly enough to replace the former GDR coins.

===Commemorative coins===

There were 123 commemorative coins altogether, with face values of M5, M10 or M20. The coins were released for various anniversaries or special events. Silver, copper/nickel/zinc (German silver / nickel silver) or other alloys were used for the coins. A complete list of all released commemorative coins can be found in the &quot;&quot;. Some of the commemorative coins were produced in very large volumes, especially the one shown above. These coins entered circulation, because they had little or no additional value for collectors due to the large numbers issued.

==Banknotes==
==East German military currency==
In 1980, East Germany prepared special military banknotes intended to be used in international missions of the National People&#x27;s Army (NVA), but they were never issued. These military notes consist of the 1955 series (DN B13 – DN B17) handstamped with the coat of arms and—in some cases—overprinted Musternote (Sample Note) or Militärgeld (Military Money). Preparations were made to introduce them in 1980, but this never occurred. Instead, in 1990 and 1991, these and other old and unissued East German notes and coins were stored in bunkers in massive sandstone caverns in the Thekenberge near Halberstadt. However, a pair of local citizens gained entry to this cache over the next decade and stole some of its contents, including the unissued military notes dated 1955, as well as two unissued notes dated 1985. In response to this theft, the remaining paper money was incinerated between April and 25 June 2002. Only a few genuine military banknotes exist; however, an abundance of 1955 series banknotes survived, as did the coat of arms handstamp. Many military banknotes have since been fabricated and it&#x27;s impossible to distinguish them from genuine notes.

<doc id="312570" wikidata="Q2282207" url="?curid=312570" title="Battle of Helena">
<text>The Battle of Helena was fought on July 4, 1863, near Helena, Arkansas, during the American Civil War. Union troops captured the city in July 1862, and had been using it as a base of operations. Over 7,500 Confederate troops led by Lieutenant General Theophilus Holmes attempted to capture Helena in hopes of relieving some of the pressure on the Confederate army besieged in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Helena was defended by about 4,100 Union troops led by Major General Benjamin Prentiss, manning one fort and four batteries of artillery.

Differing interpretations of Holmes&#x27; order to attack at daylight resulted in Brigadier General James F. Fagan&#x27;s troops attacking Battery D unsupported, and Major General Sterling Price&#x27;s attack against the Union center was made after Fagan&#x27;s had largely fizzled out. To the north, Confederate cavalry commanded by Brigadier Generals John S. Marmaduke and Lucius M. Walker failed to act in concert and accomplished little. The assaults failed, and Vicksburg fell the same day. Later in the year, Union troops used Helena as a staging ground for their successful campaign to capture Little Rock, Arkansas.

==Background==

In December 1860, the state of South Carolina seceded from the United States, as a result of several disagreements with the federal government, slavery chief among them. Further Deep South states seceded early in the next year, forming the Confederate States of America. The Civil War began on April 12, when Confederate troops bombarded Fort Sumter. When Abraham Lincoln, the newly elected President of the United States, called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion, this proved the catalyst for the southern state of Arkansas to secede and join the Confederacy. Fighting occurred to the north in Missouri during 1861, but in early March 1862, Confederate forces were defeated in northern Arkansas at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Beginning in late April, Union (United States) forces followed up on the victory at Pea Ridge by moving into Arkansas, threatening the state capital of Little Rock, and occupying the Mississippi River town of Helena on July 12.

By early 1863, holding Helena provided the Union with significant advantages, such as serving as a supply depot for the ongoing Vicksburg campaign, providing a marshalling point for a future advance against Little Rock, and securing northeastern Arkansas. In late May, with Union troops heavily pressuring Vicksburg, Confederate authorities sent a message to General Joseph E. Johnston suggesting that forces from the Trans-Mississippi Department be used to relieve the pressure on Vicksburg. One idea was an attack on Helena. The commander of Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi, Lieutenant General Edmund Kirby Smith, was forwarded in June the dispatch that Johnston had received, and delegated making the decision whether to attack Helena to Lieutenant General Theophilus Holmes, the Confederate commander of the District of Arkansas.

== Prelude ==
On June 9, Holmes learned that the strength of the Union forces in Helena was about 3,000 or 4,000 men, and decided against an attack. He thought the attack would be too costly, and instead suggested placing an artillery battery along the Mississippi River to intercept Union shipping. Further vacillation by Holmes ended when Confederate cavalry reported on June 14 that the garrison at Helena had been weakened. He began moving towards Jacksonport and met Major General Sterling Price and Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke on June 18. There they formed a plan to concentrate Confederate forces against Helena, although Holmes was still nervous about the proposed attack, as he was worried that it might fail. He made an agreement with Price, who was much more popular with the general public, that he would publicly support the decision of the attack in the case of a failure.

Once formed, the plan called for Price, with his 3,095 infantry, to move from Jacksonport to Cotton Plant on June 22, along with Marmaduke&#x27;s 1,750 cavalry; that 1,339 infantry commanded by Brigadier General James F. Fagan would move from Little Rock to Clarendon, and that Brigadier General Lucius M. Walker would screen Helena with his 1,462 cavalry. Holmes would accompany the attack. On June 22, Holmes revised the plan, ordering Price to concentrate at a location known as Switzer&#x27;s, instead of Cotton Plant. Rains and high stream levels slowed Price&#x27;s approach, and though Marmaduke&#x27;s men reached Switzer&#x27;s on time, the infantry was delayed at the crossing of the Cache River. Moving through swamps resulted in the loss of many accompanying animals and wagons. Holmes and Fagan reached Clarendon on June 26. Once there, Holmes provided further orders for the advance: Walker was to screen Fagan&#x27;s movement to Helena with part of his command, while Price continued on to Helena from Switzer&#x27;s. Price&#x27;s advance continued to be slowed by the terrain and weather, to the annoyance of Holmes, who rightly believed that the delay had prevented any remaining chance of the movement being a surprise. The Confederate columns finally united on July 3, and that day began the final movement towards Helena. Overall, the Confederates had 7,646 men.

The Union troops in Helena were commanded by Major General Benjamin Prentiss and consisted of the Thirteenth Division of the Thirteenth Corps. Although Prentiss was in command of the general district around Helena, the garrison itself was operationally commanded by Brigadier General Frederick Salomon, the commander of the division. Salomon would make many of the decisions in the upcoming battle. Prentiss originally dismissed rumors of a Confederate attack, but by late June gave more credence to the reports. A defensive position known as Fort Curtis already existed to the west of Helena, but four new batteries, named with the letters A, B, C, and D, were ordered built. Each of the four batteries was located on a high point of Crowley&#x27;s Ridge. Trees were felled in front of the Union lines, although it is unclear if they were simply left where they fell as an obstruction or were converted into abatis. Prentiss was originally intended to be reinforced by three vessels from the Union Navy, but only one, the timberclad USS &quot;Tyler&quot;, was available when the Confederate attack struck. Prentiss also cancelled a planned celebration of the Fourth of July as a precaution, and ordered the roads into town barricaded with felled trees. The Union garrison would face the coming attack with 4,129 men. Remembering the surprise suffered by men under his command in the earlier Battle of Shiloh, Prentiss ordered reveille blown daily at 2 am. Prentiss&#x27; men had advantages over the Confederates through their defenses, batteries, and naval support. The Confederates had support from the local white populace.

== Battle ==


On July 3, Holmes, Price, Walker, Fagan, and Marmaduke gathered to formulate the plan of assault. Holmes noted that the defenses of Helena were stronger than he expected but carried on with the attack anyway. Price was to attack the Union center, focusing on Battery C on Graveyard Hill. South of Price, Fagan was to attack Battery D on Hindman&#x27;s Hill, while Marmaduke, supported by Walker, was to attack from the north, take Rightor&#x27;s Hill, and then use the hill as an artillery position to fire on Batteries A and B. Walker&#x27;s specific orders were to &quot;act against the enemy as circumstances may justify&quot;, a vague order that left him under his own initiative and resulted in him accomplishing little in the coming battle. Holmes made a pledge that he would take personal responsibility for the results of the assault if it failed. The converging attack would be difficult, and the generals interpreted Holmes&#x27; order to begin the attack at &quot;daylight&quot; differently. Historian Robert Kerby describes the Confederate plan as &quot;a model of brutal irresponsibility&quot;. Since Prentiss was aware of a coming attack, the Confederates would not have the advantage of surprise. Their plans were also hampered by poor reconnaissance.

Late on July 3, Fagan sent a patrol commanded by Colonel William H. Brooks to secure the junction of the two roads leading to Little Rock. To protect Fagan&#x27;s flank, Brooks&#x27; men were sent up the Lower Little Rock Road at around 1:30 am; the detachment opened the battle in the early dawn by clashing with Union pickets. Brooks&#x27; Confederates also encountered a camp of African-American refugees. Some of the refugees were killed, some were taken prisoner, and the camp was burned by the Confederates at some point during the battle. The felled trees slowed Fagan&#x27;s main attack, which was on the Upper Little Rock Road, and forced the Confederates to leave their supply wagons and cannons behind. Either at 3:30 am or shortly after 4:00 am, Fort Curtis fired a warning shot, alerting the Union defenders to the Confederate approach. At 4:05 am, Fagan&#x27;s skirmishers sighted the Union position, and with the day dawning, Fagan attacked with three infantry regiments. Fagan&#x27;s charge took the first line of Union defenses, but his men started taking fire from Batteries C and D. Minutes after Fagan&#x27;s men became engaged, Marmaduke&#x27;s men on the north end of the Confederate line entered the action, driving Union skirmishers back towards Battery A. The Confederates came under fire from the 29th Iowa Infantry Regiment, which had been sent to reinforce the position at Rightor&#x27;s Hill, and became disorganized. Marmaduke paused his men, who were fighting dismounted, to wait for artillery to be brought up and for Walker&#x27;s men to arrive in support. Meanwhile, on the Lower Little Rock Road, Brooks ran into trouble, taking fire from Battery K, 1st Missouri Light Artillery Regiment and &quot;Tyler&quot;. The fire from the artillery battery did little damage, but the gunboat&#x27;s shots were more effective. Brooks&#x27; men became disorganized and did not reform until 8:00 am.

Price&#x27;s attack had been delayed. Advancing his men through ravines and over hills, Price decided that his artillery would have to be left behind, although picked men from his batteries were to accompany the infantry to man the Union pieces that the attack expected to capture. Obstructions on the line of approach also disorganized Price&#x27;s ranks. Price&#x27;s advance was led by the 9th Missouri Sharpshooter Battalion, who sighted the Union positions on Graveyard Hill. Despite dawn beginning to be visible in the sky, Price misunderstood Holmes&#x27; order to attack at daylight and held back his troops, until Holmes came over to explain his orders. Meanwhile, Fagan&#x27;s men attacked the second Union line of works. The 43rd Indiana Infantry Regiment had been facing Fagan&#x27;s Confederates, and was reinforced by parts of the 33rd Iowa Infantry Regiment and the 35th Missouri Infantry Regiment, under orders from Salomon. Because Price had not yet attacked, Fagan&#x27;s men came under fire from both Battery D and Battery C. Fagan&#x27;s Confederates broke through the second Union line, then a third and fourth, but then halted at about 7:00 am, their attack spent. They were now in front of Battery D.

Marmaduke had his own problems in his sector on the line. Bledsoe&#x27;s Missouri Battery was brought up to provide artillery support, and two of its guns opened on the Union positions. Marmaduke followed up the bombardment with an attack against Battery A, but fog that had concealed the advance dissipated and the attack was repulsed by the 29th Iowa, who mounted a counterattack. His dismounted cavalrymen were pushed back by the 29th Iowa and part of the 36th Iowa Infantry Regiment, and his flank was threatened by the 5th Kansas Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Indiana Cavalry Regiment, which were commanded by Powell Clayton. The two Union cavalry regiments were holding a position behind a levee. Bledsoe&#x27;s two guns were driven off, but neither side could defeat the other. Walker&#x27;s men had encountered the felled trees across their path of advance, and though he threw forward a skirmish line, most of his men remained back at the barricades. Walker&#x27;s men spent the rest of the morning primarily skirmishing with Clayton&#x27;s cavalry and firing at long range. Without Clayton&#x27;s men first being driven from behind the levee, Rightor&#x27;s Hill could not be taken.

Around the time Fagan&#x27;s men approached Battery D at 7:00 am, Price&#x27;s attack began. Price&#x27;s command consisted of the brigades of Brigadier Generals Dandridge McRae and Mosby Monroe Parsons, and was led by the 9th Missouri Sharpshooter Battalion and a company of Arkansans local to the Helena area. Confusion was initially caused by the two brigades being separated by a ridge and unable to see each other. Each wasted time waiting for the other to advance. The cannons in Battery C were manned by men from the 33rd Missouri Infantry Regiment, and they, along with a portion of the 33rd Iowa, poured a deadly fire into Parsons&#x27; men, while Battery B fired at McRae&#x27;s brigade. The failure of the attacks on Batteries A and D allowed those positions to fire on Price&#x27;s men, and &quot;Tyler&quot; and Fort Curtis added artillery fire as well; &quot;Tyler&quot; had moved to a different location that allowed for better fire on Graveyard Hill after suppressing Brooks&#x27; men. Price&#x27;s Missouri sharpshooters found positions from which they could pick off the gunners in Battery C.

Price&#x27;s first attack was repulsed, as was a second. On the third try, the Confederates managed to overrun Battery C, but the men from the 33rd Missouri had time to spike one cannon and take supplies necessary for firing before the Confederates captured the guns. Holmes and Price arrived on the hill, and finding that the Union guns could not be used, ordered Tilden&#x27;s Missouri Battery and Marshall&#x27;s Arkansas Battery to begin to come up. The advance up the hill had also thrown the Confederates into disarray. Carried by momentum, some of Price&#x27;s infantry charged down the hill towards Helena itself, but were driven off. Many men from the 7th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Lewis&#x27;) were captured at this time. A critical moment in the battle had arrived: if the Confederates could get enough artillery onto Graveyard Hill, they could shell the Union forces into submission. Prentiss ordered the other three batteries to fire on Graveyard Hill, as well as &quot;Tyler&quot;, two cannons in reserve, and four cannons from Battery K, 1st Missouri Light Artillery emplaced on Lower Little Rock Road. Confident that a single regiment could hold off Walker, Salomon pulled the 1st Indiana Cavalry towards Fort Curtis and a new line was formed in that vicinity using the Indiana cavalrymen and parts of the 33rd Iowa, 33rd Missouri, and 35th Missouri.

Fagan&#x27;s men resumed the attack upon hearing the fighting on Graveyard Hill, and drove the 43rd Indiana and part of the 33rd Iowa from the final Union line in front of Battery D, but were unable to take the Battery itself, having been hit by crossfire while maneuvering through a ravine. Fagan&#x27;s lines had been badly thinned by not only Union fire but also heat and exhaustion. Both Price and Holmes were issuing orders independently, and Holmes&#x27; orders were making things worse for the Confederates. Holmes ordered the 8th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Burns&#x27;) to attack Fort Curtis, but upon seeing the regiment charge, the rest of Parsons&#x27; men joined in, believing a general attack was beginning. The Union guns concentrated on this attack and inflicted heavy casualties on it. The few who made it close to Fort Curtis were easily repulsed. Many Confederates surrendered. Holmes ordered Parsons to attack Battery D to support Fagan, but as Parsons&#x27; men were too badly disorganized at the time, McRae was given the order to attack. McRae sent about 200 men to attack the battery, but they were unsuccessful. Believing a full-fledged attack to be a suicide charge, McRae had his men simply fire on the rifle pits in hopes of diverting attention away from Fagan&#x27;s command. Price then ordered Parsons to attack Battery D, but was informed that McRae had already been ordered to do that.

With Price&#x27;s men shredded, Fagan&#x27;s men exhausted, and the cavalry not making any progress, Holmes decided to order a withdrawal at 10:30 am. Price&#x27;s men fell back and abandoned Graveyard Hill. About 100 men remained behind on the hill, pinned down by Union fire. A Union counterattack retook the hill and captured many prisoners, with over 350 prisoners taken on Graveyard Hill alone. Between 10:30 and 11:00 am, Fagan received orders to retreat from before Battery D. Part of the 37th Arkansas Infantry Regiment was trapped during the retreat and was captured. Including the men of the 37th Arkansas, about 250 Confederates surrendered in Fagan&#x27;s sector. The Union troops had taken advantage of the severe disorganization and scattering of the Confederate forces to take the prisoners. Either around the time that Battery C fell to Price&#x27;s attack or as Fagan&#x27;s withdrawal was ending, Brooks placed a 6-pounder field gun on a hilltop and began to fire on the Union positions, but Battery K, 1st Missouri Light Artillery and &quot;Tyler&quot; drove it off. Marmaduke received orders to withdraw at about 11:00 am, but being angry at Walker over Walker&#x27;s failure to support his attack and believing that Walker faced only a small force, decided against informing Walker of his retreat. After Marmaduke&#x27;s withdrawal, Union troops attempted to attack Walker&#x27;s flank, but the Confederate cavalrymen withdrew from the field before they were caught. Walker&#x27;s withdrawal occurred at about 2:00 pm. Historian Robert E. Shalhope wrote that the Confederate attacks were repulsed &quot;perhaps less by the powerful Union entrenchments than by their own poorly co-ordinated attack&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
Holmes lost 1,636 of the 7,646 men he had taken into the battle: 173 killed, 687 wounded, and 776 missing. Prentiss claimed the capture of more than 1,100 Confederate soldiers and stated that over 300 dead Confederates were buried by Union troops. Almost all of the Confederate losses were from the brigades of Fagan, Parsons, and McRae, who took 32 percent of their attacking forces as casualties. Walker lost only 12 men; historian Mark Christ attributes this to the weakness of his attack. According to Christ, Prentiss lost 220 of the 4,129 men he took into battle: 57 killed, 127 wounded, and 36 missing. The historian Ed Bearss reports Union losses as 57 killed, 146 wounded, and 36 missing for a total of 239, and historian Thomas W. Cutrer provides the same figures as Bearss. Casualties were heaviest among the 33rd Iowa and the 33rd Missouri, while the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment (African Descent) saw the first combat wounds suffered by African American soldiers in Arkansas during the war. The unit had not completed formation at the time of the battle and was poorly trained, so it had been positioned in an area where it was unlikely to be directly engaged. Holmes accused McRae of &quot;misbehavior before the enemy&quot;, and in his report placed part of the blame for the failure on McRae, but McRae was cleared by a subsequent court-martial. The battle also destroyed any positive relationships remaining between Holmes and Price, with the former believing that the latter should have reinforced Fagan. Both Holmes and Marmaduke accused Walker of dereliction of duty.

Most of the Confederates withdrew from the area the next morning, falling back to Jacksonport, although Walker&#x27;s men remained behind to harass any Union troops that sallied forth from the city. Believing that the Confederates were preparing to attack again, Prentiss requested reinforcements, which arrived from Memphis, Tennessee, on July 6. Vicksburg had surrendered on July 4, and the Confederate garrison at Port Hudson, Louisiana fell within a week. News also reached the Union forces at Helena of a major Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. With the fall of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, the Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi were cut off from the rest of the Confederacy. Confederate infantry deserted in large numbers, their morale shattered. The Confederate repulse at Helena had preserved the Union bridgehead in eastern Arkansas, and had parried an attempt to break Union control of the Mississippi River.

Helena was reinforced and in mid-August, Union forces began a campaign against Little Rock, with Helena as the staging ground. 
Price commanded the Confederate forces during the campaign, as Holmes had fallen ill. Events during this campaign worsened the split between Marmaduke and Walker, and the former killed the latter in a duel on September 6. On September 10, Union troops took Little Rock. The Helena Confederate Cemetery includes burials of Confederate soldiers killed during the battle, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as are the remains of the Union batteries.

<doc id="312572" wikidata="Q7893191" url="?curid=312572" title="U.S. territorial sovereignty">
<text>In the United States, a territory is any extent of region under the sovereign jurisdiction of the federal government of the United States, including all waters (around islands or continental tracts). The United States asserts sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing its territory. This extent of territory is all the area belonging to, and under the dominion of, the United States federal government (which includes tracts lying at a distance from the country) for administrative and other purposes. The United States total territory includes a subset of political divisions.

==Territory of the United States==
The United States&#x27; territory includes any geography under the control of the United States federal government. Various regions, districts, and divisions are under the supervision of the United States federal government. The United States&#x27; territory includes clearly defined geographical area and refers to an area of land, air, or sea under jurisdiction of United States federal governmental authority (but is not limited only to these areas). The extent of territory is all the area belonging to, and under the dominion of, the United States of America federal government (which includes tracts lying at a distance from the country) for administrative and other purposes.

===Constitution of the United States===

Under Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, a territory is subject to and belongs to the United States (but not necessarily within the national boundaries or any individual state). This includes tracts of land or water not included within the limits of any State and not admitted as a State into the Union.

The Constitution of the United States states:
=== Congress of the United States ===
Congress possesses power to set territorial governments within the boundaries of the United States, under Article 4, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution. The first exercise of this power was the Northwest Ordinance of 1789. The power of Congress over such territory is exclusive and universal, including the creation of political divisions, except as delegated to a territory&#x27;s government by act of Congress.

===Supreme Court of the United States===
All territory under the control of the federal government is considered part of the &quot;United States&quot; for purposes of law. From 1901 to 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of opinions known as the Insular Cases held that the Constitution extended &quot;ex proprio vigore&quot; to the territories. However, the Court in these cases also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation. Under the same, the Constitution only applied fully in incorporated territories such as Alaska and Hawaii, whereas it only applied partially in the new unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. A Supreme Court ruling from 1945 stated that the term &quot;United States&quot; can have three different meanings, in different contexts:
===United States Department of the Interior===

The United States Department of the Interior is charged with managing federal affairs within U.S. territory. The Interior Department has a wide range of responsibilities (which include the regulation of territorial governments and the basic stewardship for public lands, et al.). The United States Department of the Interior is not responsible for local government or for civil administration except in the cases of Indian reservations, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as those territories administered through the Office of Insular Affairs. The exception is the &quot;incorporated and unorganized&quot; (see below) United States Territory of Palmyra Island, the legal remnant of the former United States Territory of Hawaii since 1959, in which the local government and civil administration were assigned by the Secretary of the Interior to the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2001.

==United States divisions==
===States, territories, and their subdivisions===
The contiguous United States, Hawaii, and Alaska are divided into smaller administrative regions. These are called counties in 48 of the 50 states, boroughs in Alaska and parishes in Louisiana. A county can include a number of cities and towns, or just a portion of either type. These counties have varying degrees of political and legal significance. A township in the United States refers to a small geographic area. The term is used in two ways: a survey township is simply a geographic reference used to define property location for deeds and grants; a civil township is a unit of local government, originally rural in application.

The District of Columbia and territories are under the direct authority of Congress, although each is allowed home rule. The United States government, rather than individual states or territories, conducts foreign relations under the U.S. Constitution.

Federal enclaves, such as domestic military bases and national parks, are administered directly by the federal government. To varying degrees, the federal government exercises concurrent jurisdiction with the states where federal land is part of the territory previously granted to a state.

===History of United States territory===

At times, territories are organized with a separate legislature, under a territorial governor and officers, appointed by the President and approved by the Senate of the United States. A territory has been historically divided into organized territories and unorganized territories. An unorganized territory was generally either unpopulated or set aside for Native Americans and other indigenous peoples in the United States by the U.S. federal government, until such time as the growing and restless population encroached into the areas. In recent times, &quot;unorganized&quot; refers to the degree of self-governmental authority exercised by the territory.

As a result of several Supreme Court cases after the Spanish–American War, the United States had to determine how to deal with its newly acquired territories, such as the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Wake Island, and other areas that were not part of the North American continent and which were not necessarily intended to become a part of the Union of States. As a consequence of the Supreme Court decisions, the United States has since made a distinction between incorporated and unincorporated territories. In essence, an incorporated territory is land that has been irrevocably incorporated within the sovereignty of the United States and to which the full corpus of the U.S. Constitution applies. An unincorporated territory is land held by the United States, and to which Congress of the United States applies selected parts of the constitution. At the present time, the only incorporated U.S. territory is the unorganized (and unpopulated) Palmyra Atoll.

===Insular areas===
The United States currently claims 16 insular areas as territories:
*American Samoa
*Guam
*Northern Mariana Islands
*Puerto Rico
*United States Virgin Islands
*Minor Outlying Islands
**&quot;Bajo Nuevo Bank&quot;
**Baker Island
**Howland Island
**Jarvis Island
**Johnston Atoll
**Kingman Reef
**Midway Islands
**Navassa Island
**Palmyra Atoll
**&quot;Serranilla Bank&quot;
**Wake Island
:The italicized islands are part of a territory dispute with Colombia and are not included in the ISO designation of the USMOI. The United States does not administer these two territories.

Palmyra Atoll is the only &quot;incorporated territory&quot; remaining, and having no government it is also &quot;unorganized&quot;. The remaining are unincorporated territories of the United States. Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands are styled as commonwealths.

===Dependent areas===
Several islands in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea are dependent territories of the United States.

The Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Guantanamo Bay, notionally under the sovereignty of Cuba, is administered by the United States under a perpetual lease, much as the Panama Canal Zone used to be before the signing of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties. Only mutual agreement or U.S. abandonment of the area can terminate the lease.

From July 8, 1947, until October 1, 1994, the United States administered the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, but the Trust ceased to exist when the last member state of Palau gained its independence to become the Republic of Palau. The Panama Canal, and the Canal Zone surrounding it, was territory administered by the United States until 1999, when control was relinquished to Panama.

The United States has made no territorial claim in Antarctica but has reserved the right to do so. American research stations in Antarctica—Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, McMurdo Station, and Palmer Station—are under U.S. jurisdiction but are held without sovereignty per the Antarctic Treaty.

The three Freely Associated States of Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau are not under U.S. sovereignty, but each participates in federal programs under a Compact of Free Association.

==Maritime territory of the United States==

The government of the United States of America has claims to the oceans in accord with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which delineates a zone of territory adjacent to territorial lands and seas. United States protects this marine environment, though not interfering with other lawful uses of this zone. The United States&#x27; jurisdiction has been established on vessels, ships, and artificial islands (along with other marine structures).

In 1983 President Ronald Reagan, through Proclamation No. 5030, claimed a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. In December 1988, President Reagan, through Proclamation No. 5928, extended U.S. territorial waters from three nautical miles to twelve nautical miles for national security purposes. However a legal opinion from the Justice Department questioned the President&#x27;s constitutional authority to extend sovereignty as Congress has the power to make laws concerning the territory belonging to the United States under the U.S. Constitution. In any event, Congress needs to make laws defining if the extended waters, including oil and mineral rights, are under state or federal control.

The primary enforcer of maritime law is the U.S. Coast Guard. Federal and state governments share economic and regulatory jurisdiction over the waters owned by the country. (See tidelands.)
==International law==
The United States is not restricted from making laws governing its own territory by international law. United States territory can include occupied territory, which is a geographic area that claims sovereignty, but is being forcibly d to the authority of the United States of America. United States territory can also include disputed territory, which is a geographic area claimed by the United States of America and one (or more) rival governments.

Under the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, United States territory can include areas occupied by and controlled by the United States Armed Forces. When de facto military control is maintained and exercised, occupation (and thus possession) extends to that territory. Military personnel in control of the territory have a responsibility to provide for the basic needs of individuals under their control (which includes food, clothing, shelter, medical attention, law maintenance, and social order). To prevent systematic abuse of puppet governments by the occupation forces, they must enforce laws that were in place in the territory prior to the occupation.

==Customs territories==
The fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico form the main customs territory of the United States. Special rules apply to foreign trade zones in these areas. Separate customs territories are formed by American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

==Other areas==

U.S. sovereignty includes the airspace over its land and territorial waters. No international agreement exists on the vertical limit that separates this from outer space, which is international.

Federal jurisdiction includes federal enclaves like national parks and domestic military bases, even though these are located in the territory of a state. Host states exercise concurrent jurisdiction to some degree.

The United States exercises extraterritoriality on military installations, American embassies and consulates located in foreign countries, and research centers and field camps in Antarctica. Despite exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction, these overseas locations remain under the sovereignty of the host countries (except Antarctica, where there is no host country). Because they are not part of any state, extraterritorial jurisdiction is federal, with Congress&#x27;s plenary power under Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution.

The federal government also exercises property ownership, but not sovereignty over land in various foreign countries. Examples include the &quot;John F. Kennedy Memorial&quot; built at Runnymede in England, and around Pointe du Hoc in Normandy, France.

==History of U.S. federal lands==
The Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 provided for the survey and settlement of the lands that the original Thirteen Colonies ceded to the federal government after the American Revolution. As additional lands were acquired by the United States from Spain, France and other countries, the United States Congress directed that they be explored, surveyed, and made available for settlement. During the Revolutionary War, military bounty land was promised to soldiers who fought for the colonies. After the war, the Treaty of Paris of 1783, signed by the United States, the UK, France, and Spain, ceded territory to the United States. In the 1780s, other states relinquished their own claims to land in modern-day Ohio. By this time, the United States needed revenue to function. Land was sold so that the government would have money to survive. In order to sell the land, surveys needed to be conducted. The Land Ordinance of 1785 instructed a geographer to oversee this work as undertaken by a group of surveyors. The first years of surveying were completed by trial and error; once the territory of Ohio had been surveyed, a modern public land survey system had been developed. In 1812, Congress established the United States General Land Office as part of the Department of the Treasury to oversee the disposition of these federal lands. By the early 1800s, promised bounty land claims were finally fulfilled.

In the 19th century, other bounty land and homestead laws were enacted to dispose of federal land. Several different types of patents existed. These include cash entry, credit, homestead, Indian, military warrants, mineral certificates, private land claims, railroads, state selections, swamps, town sites, and town lots. A system of local land offices spread throughout the territories, patenting land that was surveyed via the corresponding Office of the Surveyor General of a particular territory. This pattern gradually spread across the entire United States. The laws that spurred this system with the exception of the General Mining Law of 1872 and the Desert Land Act of 1877 have since been repealed or superseded.

In the early 20th century, Congress took additional steps toward recognizing the value of the assets on public lands and directed the Executive Branch to manage activities on the remaining public lands. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 allowed leasing, exploration, and production of selected commodities, such as coal, oil, gas, and sodium to take place on public lands. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 established the United States Grazing Service to manage the public rangelands by establishment of advisory boards that set grazing fees. The Oregon and California Revested Lands Sustained Yield Management Act of 1937, commonly referred as the O&amp;C Act, required sustained yield management of the timberlands in western Oregon.

Currently, federal lands are about 640 million acres, about 28% of the total U.S. land area of 2.27 billion acres.

<text>The Battle of Buena Vista (February 22–23, 1847), known as the Battle of La Angostura in Mexico, and sometimes as Battle of Buena Vista/La Angostura, was a battle of the Mexican–American War. It was fought between U.S. forces, largely volunteers, under General Zachary Taylor, and the much larger Mexican Army under General Antonio López de Santa Anna. It took place near Buena Vista, a village in the state of Coahuila, about south of Saltillo, Mexico. &quot;La Angostura&quot; (&quot;the narrow place&quot;) was the local name for the site. The outcome of the battle was ambiguous, with both sides claiming victory. Santa Anna&#x27;s forces withdrew with war trophies of cannons and flags and left the field to the surprised U.S. forces, who had expected there to be another day of hard fighting.

==Background==

U.S. president James K. Polk had decided that an invasion into central Mexico via the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz would make the Mexicans come to the negotiating table. He told Major General Zachary Taylor to stay in his position at Monterrey. Polk had placed General Winfield Scott as commander of all the U.S. forces in Mexico. Scott himself ordered Taylor to remain in place. After the Battle of Monterrey and the end of the armistice, Taylor&#x27;s Army of Occupation with Brigadier General William J. Worth&#x27;s 1,000 men advanced onto undefended Saltillo on November 16, despite orders to halt any movement further south, considering it strategic to cover the approaches to Monterrey and Parras de la Fuente. Taylor then directed General John E. Wool from Monclova to Parras, the objective being control of that agricultural area. Wool&#x27;s force moved to Agua Nueva, south of Saltillo, on December 21, to counter rumors of impending attack. Scott had intelligence that the army of Santa Anna was getting into position to attack, just six miles from Taylor&#x27;s position.

In mid-August 1846, General Antonio López de Santa Anna returned from exile and quickly assumed command of the Mexican Army, having tricked Polk into allowing him to return to Mexico, telling him that he could reconcile Mexico to make peace with the U.S. He reached San Luis Potosí on October 8 with a force of 20,000 men and 5,000 women (&quot;soldaderas&quot;). This was a significant force, but some troops had no uniforms or weapons. In general, Mexican forces had large numbers but had far fewer resources than those of the U.S., with outdated weapons, inability to pay its troops, and inability to consistently provision its forces, since there was no money to pay local civilians. Most troops were new recruits, and most had not fired a single weapon in training. However, Santa Anna had the advantage of knowing the territory since the Mexican army had often used the main route.

In early January while encamped in San Luis de Potosí, Santa Anna acquired a letter from General Scott ordering Worth&#x27;s troops to join General David E. Twiggs and General John A. Quitman&#x27;s divisions in Veracruz, prompting Santa Anna to make attack plans for Saltillo. General José de Urrea&#x27;s cavalry would simultaneously retake Ciudad Victoria and cut off Monterrey from the port of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Santa Anna&#x27;s army departed San Luis Potosí on January 27 with a force of 21,553, and reached Encarnación, south of Saltillo, with 15,142 men on February 20. General Miñon surprised a group of 100 U.S. troops at Encarnación, and took them captive. Their capture cheered the Mexican troops. The winter weather was against the poorly dressed and provisioned Mexicans, with the coldest temperatures in decades. The men and women in Santa Anna&#x27;s forces began to die of exposure, and thirst once the cold weather lifted was also a problem. Some &quot;soldaderas&quot; set fire to trees around the encamped troops to warm them, but by the time the two armies fought, the Mexican forces had already lost thousands to illness, exposure, and desertion.

Taylor moved 4,650 of his men to Agua Nueva on February 14, but on February 20, Major Benjamin McCulloch&#x27;s Texas Rangers encountered Santa Anna&#x27;s force at Encarnación, prompting Taylor&#x27;s withdrawal to La Angostura (&quot;the narrow place&quot;), a mile and a quarter south of Hacienda San Juan de la Buena Vista. General Wool was charged with selecting &quot;the field of battle&quot; and making &quot;such dispositions of the troops on the arrival of the enemy&quot; as he deemed necessary. Wool thought the site excellent for defense, since the road passed through a narrow valley here, which was crossed at right angles by several ravines east of the road and &quot;arroyos&quot; were to the west. Wool placed Captain John M. Washington&#x27;s battery across the road, supported by the 1st Illinois under Colonel John J. Hardin and 2nd Kentucky under Colonel William R. McKee. Continuing to the left was the 2nd Illinois under Colonel William H. Bissell, General Joseph Lane&#x27;s Indiana Brigade, and the Kentucky and Arkansas horsemen, with two squadrons of dragoons and a company of Texans in reserve.

Santa Anna&#x27;s forces consisted of Major General Manuel María Lombardini&#x27;s division and Major General Francisco Pacheco&#x27;s division in the center with 14 pieces of artillery, Colonel Santiago Blanco&#x27;s regiment of engineers, and three 16-pounders on the left, and Major General Pedro de Ampudia&#x27;s light infantry with General Julián Juvera&#x27;s strong cavalry brigade on the right with two batteries. In reserve was Major General José María Ortega&#x27;s infantry division and Brigadier General Francisco Mejia&#x27;s brigade.

==Battle==

Santa Anna had chosen the day of battle, not apparently aware that it was George Washington&#x27;s birthday, which galvanized patriotic sentiment among the U.S. forces. &quot;A more inopportune moment could not have been selected by the Mexican general.&quot; A captured U.S. soldier said the Mexicans found it hard to believe that General Washington had not been leading the troops himself, but had been dead for nearly fifty years.

Santa Anna had advanced to Carnero Pass below Agua Nueva on February 21 and on February 22 demanded Taylor&#x27;s surrender, to which Taylor&#x27;s aide, William Wallace Smith Bliss, replied, &quot;I beg leave to say that I decline acceding to your request.&quot;

Santa Anna began the attack with a feint by Mejía to the American right, but his main thrust was to the American left. Wool moved three companies of Kentucky cavalry under Colonel Humphrey Marshall and four rifle companies of the Arkansas regiment under Colonel John S. Roane and four companies of Hoosiers under Major Willis A. Gorman to strengthen his left. Marshall and Ampudia&#x27;s men skirmished by 3:30 pm, but darkness brought an end to the fighting.
After dark, Taylor, escorted by the Mississippi Rifles, Colonel Jefferson Davis, and Charles A. May&#x27;s dragoons, checked on the Saltillo garrison, but returned by 9:00 am on February 23. During the night, Brigadier General Manuel Micheltorena moved five 8-pounders above the American left, intending to flank them along the high ground the next morning at daylight.

Ampudia&#x27;s brigade started the assault, supported by Lombardini and Pacheco&#x27;s divisions, while Moras demonstrated against the American right. The 2nd Indiana faced a force of 7,000 Mexicans, prompting Wool to send the 2nd Illinois and Captain Thomas W. Sherman&#x27;s battery in support.

The Hoosiers, after taking 90 casualties, broke and fled, forcing the 2nd Illinois into a slow fighting withdrawal, and Marshall&#x27;s men to flee northward to the Buena Vista hacienda. Juvera&#x27;s cavalry was able to turn the American left flank and head for Buena Vista.

Davis&#x27; Mississippians were ordered to shield Buena Vista along with the volunteers of the Arkansas and Kentucky cavalry, the 3rd Indiana, and Captain Enoch Steen&#x27;s dragoons. A large Mexican force routed the cavalry, killing Archibald Yell, and then reached the hacienda of Buena Vista. They had expected the building to be full of provisions, but instead they were dismayed to find that U.S. troops taking refuge in it were persuaded by their officers to defend it. The Mexican forces withdrew, pursued by U.S. cavalry.

Steen&#x27;s dragoons were able to split Juvera&#x27;s column, forcing the advance portion past the hacienda and under fire from Sherman&#x27;s battery, while the dragoons threw the rest into confusion. Davis&#x27; men then sent the Mexicans fleeing, although Davis was wounded in the heel.

Major John Munroe organized the defense of the hacienda proper, using the 2nd Indiana, from Juvera&#x27;s attacks, while the Mississippians and the 3rd Indiana were organized into a large &quot;V&quot; which forced Juvera&#x27;s approximately 2,000 survivors into a ravine. A young Mexican lieutenant, José María Montoya, tricked Taylor into a ceasefire, allowing the trapped Mexicans enough time to escape. Brigadier José Vicente Miñón appeared before Saltillo but retreated to the southwest.

Santa Anna renewed an attack on the main U.S. position led by General Francisco Pérez with artillery support. They were met at 5:00 p.m. by fire from O&#x27;Brien and Thomas&#x27;s guns and two Illinois and a Kentucky regiment under Colonel John J. Hardin, during which Hardin was killed.

An artillery battery under Captain Braxton Bragg then arrived with orders to &quot;maintain the position at all costs&quot;. Taylor rode over to Bragg, and after a brief conversation in which Bragg replied he was using single canister shot, Taylor ordered &quot;double-shot your guns and give &#x27;em hell, Bragg&quot;. Later, this order, although misquoted as &quot;give them a little more grape, Captain Bragg&quot;, would be used as a campaign slogan that carried Taylor into the White House. Pérez&#x27;s attack was repelled and the fighting ended as heavy rain fell over the field. On the battlefield, the heroine of Fort Brown, Sarah A. Bowman, known as the &quot;Great Western&quot;, ministered to American troops, including &quot;bolstering the nerves of the soldiers.&quot;

Santa Anna believed his army was on the verge of exhaustion and collapse, due to lack of provisions. Some Mexican soldiers were so driven by hunger that they &quot;conducted unauthorized attacks just so they could take food from the Americans&quot;. In assessing whether to hold the field or withdraw, Santa Anna calculated that the lack of provisions would drive many of his men to desertion. On February 23, some of Santa Anna&#x27;s council of war at Agua Nueva advised withdrawal, while others argued that cattle could be driven there to provision the soldiers. Those that argued for remaining thought that with one more day of fighting, the Mexicans would achieve a complete victory. However, the decision was to withdraw to Agua Nueva, and they left their campfires ablaze to confuse the U.S. troops. Taylor led his army back to Nueva Agua, but he did not pursue Santa Anna any further south.

Many U.S. soldiers going into battle with Mexican forces held Mexicans to be their racial inferiors and poor soldiers. These soldiers were often unbelieving, but &quot;learned after Monterey and Buena Vista to respect the fighting qualities of the Mexican soldier&quot;.

==Immediate aftermath==
Santa Anna withdrew his troops, leaving the battlefield to the surprised U.S. forces. Santa Anna&#x27;s forces had captured important war trophies from the U.S. Army, cannons and flags, as well as arms, which remained on display into the modern era at the Artillery School of Mexico. In the account written by Mexicans in the immediate aftermath of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the war, they considered the battle a victory. &quot;On our part, the army was proclaimed victorious, alleging in proof the trophies captured, the positions taken, and the [U.S.] divisions vanquished. The truth is, our arms routed the Americans in all the encounters, and so far the issue of the battle is favorable to us. There had been three partial triumphs, but not a complete victory.&quot; There were serious losses of Mexican dead and wounded.

Recovery of the bodies of the U.S. dead was a phenomenon of this conflict. The most famous from Buena Vista/La Angostura was that of Henry Clay Jr., the third son of American statesman Henry Clay, a vociferous opponent of the Mexican War. His death was the subject of at least seven prints by Currier and Ives, and Neale and Pate, and others. The Currier and Ives print depicts him shortly after being wounded, urging his comrades to leave him to his fate. The grave site became well known, with two surviving daguerreotypes recording it at different times of the day and from different angles. Clay&#x27;s body was disinterred and transported to the U.S. for burial by Jefferson Davis. Also killed were Archibald Yell, former governor of Arkansas, and John J. Hardin of Illinois, a Whig political rival of Abraham Lincoln. The state of Kentucky paid for the retrieval and transport of some officers and enlisted men, who were subsequently buried in a common grave near the Kentucky State House in the capital Frankfort. There was a large public funeral on July 20, 1847, honoring the sacrifices of the dead Kentuckians, with John C. Breckinridge praising them. Breckinridge had been an opponent of the war, but volunteered shortly after his own patriotic speech.

==Public reaction in the U.S.==
News of the battle in the U.S. was not immediate, with communications from Mexico slow because the battle took place in a relatively remote inland area of northern Mexico. There were initial rumors that the Mexicans had carried the day and captured Taylor. Reliable news did not reach New Orleans until mid-March and New York City on April 1. Once the news broke, it entered the national consciousness and there was an outpouring of praise in poetry, prose, music, and art. Poet Walt Whitman joined in the praise. Since the American forces were largely volunteers rather than regular army, it increased Buena Vista&#x27;s popularity in the public imagination. The volunteers were characterized as raw citizen-soldiers who had defeated the far larger Mexican army, seen as a professional military force.

Simultaneous with Buena Vista was Scott&#x27;s landing at Veracruz, to push into the Mexican heartland and take the capital. When news did arrive, it was characterized as a glorious victory of a small and intrepid U.S. army against the far larger force of Mexicans. Taylor&#x27;s hard-fought victory at Buena Vista overshadowed Scott&#x27;s successful taking of Veracruz after a lengthy bombardment that produced few American casualties, but rather many Mexican civilian casualties.

==Written accounts and images==

There were a number of contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous accounts of the battle on both sides of the conflict. Captain James Henry Carleton fought at Buena Vista and remained in the area in the occupation forces. During his time he revisited the battlefield and set down remembrances of the combat. There were other soldier accounts, including George C. Furber&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Months Volunteer&quot;; Benjamin Franklin Scribner, and Samuel French also published accounts of their participation. Lieutenant Lew Wallace was not present at the battle, but visited the battle ground a few days later, writing a vivid account of sight and smell. &quot;There the wrecks lay in awful significance--dead men and horses, bayonets, accoutrements, broken muskets, hats, caps, cartridge paper, fragments of clothing. the earth and rocks were in places black with blood, here splotch, there a little rill.&quot; He also noted the large pit graves of fallen soldiers of both sides. 
 
A great many images of the battle were produced for public consumption in the U.S., the most famous of which is the scene of battle done from a sketch by Taylor&#x27;s aide-de-camp, Major Eaton. Eaton made notes of the battlefield, recorded the topography, and queried other battle participants. The published battle scene was large, (19 1/4 inches x 29 1/4 inches; 48.9 x 74.9 cm.). It was offered for sale to the public on September 15, 1847, while the war continued. In contemporary accounts, it was praised for its accuracy concerning the topography as well as its beauty. A modern assessment of the battle scene points to the inconsistencies common among battle scenes; that is, the reduction of troop numbers and oversimplification of movement. Many images depict the fierce nature of the combat and the captions of some of the images seek to highlight the valor of particular troops and asserting the U.S. victory. Carl Nebel&#x27;s painting is part of a series he did, documenting battles of the war, illustrating journalist George Wilkins Kendall&#x27;s &quot;The War Between the United States and Mexico, Illustrated&quot;, but Kendall did not visit the Buena Vista battle ground, and likely neither did Nebel. Kendall credited Carleton&#x27;s account of Captain John P. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s holding the U.S. line and control of the guns. Nebel does not credit Eaton&#x27;s lithograph of the battle scene.

==Place names==
Buena Vista County, Iowa, in 1859, was named in honor of the battle, as were Buena Vista Township, in Michigan&#x27;s Saginaw County, and the cities of Buena Vista, Virginia; of Buena Vista, Kentucky; Buena Vista, Colorado; Buena Vista, Oregon; Buena Vista, New Jersey; Buena Vista, Alabama; Buena Vista, Mississippi; Buena Vista, Pennsylvania; and Buena Vista, Georgia. Buena Vista Park in San Francisco is also named after the battle.

<text>(born Yokoi Tokiari; September 22, 1809 – February 15, 1869) was a Bakumatsu and early Meiji period scholar and political reformer in Japan, influential around the fall of the Tokugawa bakufu. 

== Life and career ==
Yokoi was a &quot;samurai&quot; born in Kumamoto, Higo Province (present-day Kumamoto Prefecture), and a distant descendant of Hōjō Takatoki. Yokoi married Yajima Tsuseko and had two children with her, Miyako and Tokio. He was sent by the domain to Edo in 1839 for studies, and developed contacts with pro-reform members of the Mito domain. After his return to Kumamoto, he started a group to promote the reform of domain administration along Neo-Confucianism lines, opening a domain school called &quot;Shōnan-do&quot;.

In 1857, he was invited by the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Echizen, Matsudaira Yoshinaga to become his political advisor. While in Fukui, Yokoi wrote &quot;Kokuze Sanron&quot; (the Three Major Discussion of State Policy). One of the topics covered in Yokoi’s treatise was on state religion, in which Yokoi commented that although Japan had Buddhism, Shinto, and Confucianism, it lacked a true national religion in the manner of western nations, and that this lack was a weakness in the Japanese &quot;kokutai&quot;, which placed Japan at a disadvantage to the western powers. This concept provided one rationale underpinning the formation of State Shinto in the later Meiji period Empire of Japan. In the same treatise, he also stressed the importance of a strong navy for the defense of Japan. He has been labelled &quot;pro-Western&quot; by contemporary historians, but was nevertheless harshly critical of Christianity as both false and heretical compared to Japanese Buddhism.

In 1862, Matsudaira was unexpectedly made acting prime minister of the Tokugawa administration (&quot;seiji sōsai&quot;) in a move calculated to obtain imperial approval for the &quot;Shōgun&#x27;s&quot; actions in signing unequal treaties (similar to those signed by Qing dynasty China) with the western powers in 1858, ending the national seclusion policy which was supported by the Imperial Court, and Yokoi accompanied him to Edo.

Yokoi called for a complete reform of the Tokugawa government, including reconciliation between the Shogunate and the Imperial Court. He also called for the complete opening of Japan to foreign trade, economic reform, and establishment of a modern military along western lines. After reading Chinese scholar and reformer Wei Yuan&#x27;s &quot;Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms&quot;, Yokoi became convinced that Japan should embark on a &quot;cautious, gradual and realistic opening of its borders to the Western world&quot; and thereby avoid the mistake China had made in engaging in the First Opium War. He also called for a national assembly of the major domains, with the Shōgun evolving into something that resembled a prime minister. Outraged and astounded by these radical ideas, conservatives within the government quickly stripped Yokoi of his posts, and even his &quot;samurai&quot; status, and placed him under house arrest in Kumamoto. However, while in exile, Yokoi continued to maintain contact with Katsu Kaishū and other reform-minded members of government.

After the Meiji Restoration, Yokoi was freed by the new Meiji government, and honored with the title of &quot;san&#x27;yo&quot; (councilor). However, Yokoi was assassinated in 1869 by conservative &quot;samurai&quot; who suspected him of being a Christian, and of harboring secret republican sentiments.

<text>James E. Casey (March 29, 1888 – June 6, 1983) was an American businessman, known for being the founder of the &quot;American Messenger Company&quot;, today known as UPS.

In 1907, 19-year-old James Casey founded the American Messenger Company in Seattle, Washington. He served as president, CEO and chairman. Claude Ryan was his partner and his messengers were his brother George and other teenagers. His motto was &quot;best service and lowest rates&quot;. Deliveries were made on foot, bicycle, or motorcycle.

He died on June 6, 1983, in a hospital-nursing home in Seattle and his grave is at the mausoleum of the Holyrood Catholic Cemetery in Shoreline, Washington.

==Background==
Casey was born in Pickhandle Gulch near Candelaria, Nevada, the son of Irish immigrants.

He consistently gave credit to his mother, Annie E. Casey, for holding their family together after Jim&#x27;s father died. As a youngster delivering packages on the Seattle streets, Jim Casey was exposed to the excesses of a bustling city in the midst of the Klondike Gold Rush. He credited the guidance of a strong mother and support of his family with keeping him grounded.

On August 28, 1907, he founded the American Messenger Company with Claude Ryan in Seattle, Washington, capitalized with $100 in debt. Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.

In 1913, the American Messenger Company agreed to merge with Evert McCabe&#x27;s Motorcycle Messengers. Merchants Parcel Delivery was formed and focused now on packages. Their first delivery car was a 1913 Ford Model T.

In 1919, the company expanded beyond Seattle and changed its name to United Parcel Service (UPS).

The successful businessman sought ways to help those who lacked the family life he found to be so crucial. With his brothers George and Harry and his sister Marguerite, Mr. Casey created Casey Family Programs in 1966 to help children who were unable to live with their birth parents—giving them stability and an opportunity to grow to responsible adulthood.

By the time of his death, Mr. Casey left three legacies: UPS, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, and Casey Family Programs.

Casey was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Department of Labor Hall of Fame (in 2002) and the Logistics Hall of Fame (in 2016).

<text>&quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; (Roud 771), originally known as &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Song&quot;, is a United States marching song about the abolitionist John Brown. The song was popular in the Union during the American Civil War. The song arose out of the folk hymn tradition of the American camp meeting movement of the late 18th and early 19th century. According to an 1889 account, the original John Brown lyrics were a collective effort by a group of Union soldiers who were referring both to the famous John Brown and also, humorously, to a Sergeant John Brown of their own battalion. Various other authors have published additional verses or claimed credit for originating the John Brown lyrics and tune.

The &quot;flavor of coarseness, possibly of irreverence&quot; led many of the era to feel uncomfortable with the earliest &quot;John Brown&quot; lyrics. This in turn led to the creation of many variant versions of the text that aspired to a higher literary quality. The most famous of these is Julia Ward Howe&#x27;s &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, which was written when a friend suggested, &quot;Why do you not write some good words for that stirring tune?&quot; Kimball suggests that President Lincoln made this suggestion to Howe, though other sources do not agree on this point.

Numerous informal versions and adaptations of the lyrics and music have been created from the mid-1800s to the present, making &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; an example of a living folk music tradition.

==History of the tune==

&quot;Say, Brothers, Will You Meet Us&quot;, the tune that eventually became associated with &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; and the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, was formed in the American camp meeting circuit of the late 18th century and the 19th century. These meetings were usually held in frontier areas, when people who lacked regular access to church services would gather together to worship before traveling preachers. These meetings were important social events, but developed a reputation for wildness in addition to wild religious fervor experienced by attendees. In that atmosphere, where hymns were taught and learned by rote and a spontaneous and improvisational element was prized, both tunes and words changed and adapted in true folk music fashion:

Early versions of &quot;Say, Brothers&quot; included variants, developed as part of this call-and-response hymn singing tradition such as:

This initial line was repeated three times and finished with the tag &quot;On Canaan&#x27;s happy shore&quot;.

The first choruses included lines such as

The familiar &quot;Glory, glory, hallelujah&quot; chorus—a notable feature of the &quot;John Brown Song&quot;, the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, and many other texts that used this tune—developed out of the oral camp meeting tradition sometime between 1808 and the 1850s.

Folk hymns like &quot;Say, Brothers&quot; circulated and evolved chiefly through oral tradition rather than through print. In print, the camp meeting song can be traced back as early as 1806–1808, when it was published in camp meeting song collections in South Carolina, Virginia, and Massachusetts.

The tune and variants of the &quot;Say, brothers&quot; hymn text were popular in southern camp meetings, with both African-American and white worshipers, throughout the early 1800s, spread predominantly through Methodist and Baptist camp meeting circuits. As the southern camp meeting circuit died down in the mid-1800s, the &quot;Say, brothers&quot; tune was incorporated into hymn and tune books and it was via this route that the tune became well known in the mid-1800s throughout the northern U.S. By 1861, &quot;groups as disparate as Baptists, Mormons, Millerites, the American Sunday School Union, and the Sons of Temperance all claimed &#x27;Say Brothers&#x27; as their own.&quot;

For example, in 1858 words and the tune were published in &quot;The Union Harp and Revival Chorister&quot;, selected and arranged by Charles Dunbar, and published in Cincinnati. The book contains the words and music of a song &quot;My Brother Will You Meet Me&quot;, with the music but not the words of the &quot;Glory Hallelujah&quot; chorus; and the opening line &quot;Say my brother will you meet me&quot;. In December 1858 a Brooklyn Sunday school published a hymn called &quot;Brothers, Will You Meet Us&quot; with the words and music of the &quot;Glory Hallelujah&quot; chorus, and the opening line &quot;Say, brothers will you meet us&quot;.
Some researchers have maintained that the tune&#x27;s roots go back to a &quot;Negro folk song&quot;, an African-American wedding song from Georgia, or to a British sea shanty that originated as a Swedish drinking song. Anecdotes indicate that versions of &quot;Say, Brothers&quot; were sung as part of African American ring shouts; appearance of the hymn in this call-and-response setting with singing, clapping, stomping, dancing, and extended ecstatic choruses may have given impetus to the development of the well known &quot;Glory hallelujah&quot; chorus. Given that the tune was developed in an oral tradition, it is impossible to say for certain which of these influences may have played a specific role in the creation of this tune, but it is certain that numerous folk influences from different cultures such as these were prominent in the musical culture of the camp meeting, and that such influences were freely combined in the music-making that took place in the revival movement.

It has been suggested that &quot;Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us&quot;, popular among Southern blacks, already had an anti-slavery sub-text, with its reference to &quot;Canaan&#x27;s happy shore&quot; alluding to the idea of crossing the river to a happier place. If so, that subtext was considerably enhanced and expanded as the various &quot;John Brown&quot; lyrics took on themes related to the famous abolitionist and the American Civil War.

==Use of the song during the Civil War==

In 1861, the new 29th New York Infantry Regiment was stationed in Charles Town, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia), where John Brown was executed. The contemporary abolitionist newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot; wrote that hundreds of soldiers from the unit would visit the site of John Brown&#x27;s hanging daily, and sing a refrain that went:

Brown&#x27;s friend and admirer Frederick Douglass wrote in an 1874 newspaper piece:

At Andersonville Prison, which held Union prisoners of war, a visiting Confederate soldier describes it thus:

==Use elsewhere==
On May 1, 1865, in Charleston, South Carolina, recently freed African-Americans and some white missionaries held a parade of 10,000 people, led by 3,000 Black children singing &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;. The march honored 257 dead Union soldiers whose remains the organizers had reburied from a mass grave in a Confederate prison camp. This is considered the first observation of Decoration Day, now known as Memorial Day.

The American consul in Vladivostok, Russia, Richard T. Greener, reported in 1906 that Russian soldiers were singing the song. The context was the 1905 Russian Revolution.

==History of the text of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;==

===First public performance===
At a flag-raising ceremony at Fort Warren, near Boston, on Sunday May 12, 1861, the &quot;John Brown&quot; song was publicly played &quot;perhaps for the first time&quot;. The American Civil War had begun the previous month.

Newspapers reported troops singing the song as they marched in the streets of Boston on July 18, 1861, and there was a &quot;rash&quot; of broadside printings of the song with substantially the same words as the undated &quot;John Brown Song!&quot; broadside, stated by Kimball to be the first published edition, and the broadside with music by C. S. Marsh copyrighted on July 16, 1861, also published by C.S. Hall (see images displayed on this page). Other publishers also came out with versions of the &quot;John Brown Song&quot; and claimed copyright.

===&quot;Tiger&quot; Battalion writes the lyrics; Kimball&#x27;s account===
In 1890, George Kimball wrote his account of how the 2nd Infantry Battalion of the Massachusetts militia, known as the &quot;Tiger&quot; Battalion, collectively worked out the lyrics to &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;. Kimball wrote:
According to Kimball, these sayings became bywords among the soldiers and, in a communal effort—similar in many ways to the spontaneous composition of camp meeting songs described above—were gradually put to the tune of &quot;Say, Brothers&quot;:

Some leaders of the battalion, feeling the words were coarse and irreverent, tried to urge the adoption of more fitting lyrics, but to no avail. The lyrics were soon prepared for publication by members of the battalion, together with publisher C. S. Hall. They selected and polished verses they felt appropriate, and may even have enlisted the services of a local poet to help polish and create verses.

The official histories of the old First Artillery and of the 55th Artillery (1918) also record the Tiger Battalion&#x27;s role in creating the John Brown Song, confirming the general thrust of Kimball&#x27;s version with a few additional details.

===Other claims of authorship===
====William Steffe====
In hymnals and folks song collections, the hymn tune for &quot;Say, Brothers&quot; is often attributed to William Steffe. Robert W. Allen summarizes Steffe&#x27;s own story of composing the tune:

Steffe finally told the whole story of the writing of the song. He was asked to write it in 1855 or 56 for the Good Will Engine Company of Philadelphia. They used it as a song of welcome for the visiting Liberty Fire Company of Baltimore. The original verse for the song was &quot;Say, Bummers, Will You Meet Us?&quot; Someone else converted the &quot;Say, Bummers&quot; verse into the hymn &quot;Say, Brothers, Will You Meet Us&quot;. He thought he might be able to identify that person, but was never able to do so.

Though Steffe may have played a role in creating the &quot;Say, Bummers&quot; version of the song, which seems to be a variant of and owe a debt to both &quot;Say, Brothers&quot; and &quot;John Brown&quot;, Steffe couldn&#x27;t have written the &quot;Glory Hallelujah&quot; tune or the &quot;Say, Brothers&quot; text, both of which had been circulating for decades before his birth.

====Thomas Brigham Bishop====
Maine songwriter, musician, band leader, and Union soldier Thomas Brigham Bishop (1835–1905) has also been credited as the originator of the John Brown Song, notably by promoter James MacIntyre in a 1916 book and 1935 interview. (Bishop also claimed to have written &quot;Kitty Wells&quot;, &quot;Shoo, Fly Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;, and &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;, and to have played a role in the composition of &quot;Swanee River&quot;.)

====Other claimants====
In the late 1800s, during the song&#x27;s height of popularity, a number of other authors claimed to have played a part in the origin of the song.
Some sources list Steffe, Bishop, Frank E. Jerome, and others as the tune&#x27;s composer. Given the tune&#x27;s use in the camp meeting circuits in the late 1700s and early 1800s and the first known publication dates of 1806–1808, long before most of these claimants were born, it is apparent that none of these authors composed the tune that was the basis of &quot;Say, Brothers&quot; and &quot;John Brown&quot;.

As Annie J. Randall wrote, &quot;Multiple authors, most of them anonymous, borrowed the tune from &#x27;Say, Brothers&#x27;, gave it new texts, and used it to hail Brown&#x27;s war to abolish the centuries-old practice of slavery in America.&quot; This continual re-use and spontaneous adaptation of existing words and tunes is an important feature of the oral folk music tradition that &quot;Say, Brothers&quot; and the &quot;John Brown Song&quot; were embedded in and no one would have begrudged their use or re-use of these folk materials. Some of those who claimed to have composed the tune may have had a hand in creating and publishing some of the perfectly legitimate variants or alternate texts that used the tune—but all certainly wanted a share of the fame that came with being known as the author of this very well known tune.

===Creation of other versions===
Once &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; became popular as a marching song, more literary versions of the &quot;John Brown&quot; lyrics were created for the &quot;John Brown&quot; tune. For example, William Weston Patton wrote his influential version in October 1861, which was published in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, 16 December of that year. The &quot;Song of the First of Arkansas&quot; was written, or written down, by Capt. Lindley Miller in 1864, although (typical of the confusion of authorship among the variants and versions) a similar text with the title &quot;The Valiant Soldiers&quot; is also attributed to Sojourner Truth. &quot;The President&#x27;s Proclamation&quot; was written by Edna Dean Proctor in 1863 on the occasion of the Emancipation Proclamation. Other versions include the &quot;Marching song of the 4th Battalion of Rifles, 13th Reg., Massachusetts Volunteers&quot; and the &quot;Kriegslied der Division Blenker&quot;, written for the Blenker Division, a group of German soldiers who had participated in the European revolutions of 1848/49 and fought for the Union in the American Civil War.

==Other related texts==

The tune was later also used for &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; (written in November 1861, published in February 1862; this song was directly inspired by &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;), &quot;Marching Song of the First Arkansas&quot;, &quot;The Battle Hymn of Cooperation&quot;, &quot;Bummers, Come and Meet Us&quot; (see facsimile), and many other related texts and parodies during and immediately after the American Civil War period.

The World War II American paratrooper song &quot;Blood on the Risers&quot; is set to the tune, and includes the chorus &quot;Glory, glory (or Gory, gory), what a hell of a way to die/And he ain&#x27;t gonna jump no more!&quot; It has since also been adapted to civilian skydiving.

The tune was used for perhaps the most well-known labor-union song in the United States, &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;. The song became an anthem of the Industrial Workers of the World and all unions that sought more than workplace concessions, but a world run by those who labor.

Sailors are known to have adapted &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; into a sea shanty—specifically, into a &quot;Capstan Shanty&quot;, used during anchor-raising.

The &quot;John Brown&quot; tune has proven popular for folk-created texts, with many irreverent versions created over the years. &quot;The Burning of the School&quot; is a well-known parody sung by schoolchildren, and another version that begins &quot;John Brown&#x27;s baby has a cold upon his chest&quot; is often sung by children at summer camps. The same tune is also used for a children&#x27;s song that begins &quot;Peter Rabbit had a fly upon his nose&quot;, inspired by Beatrix Potter&#x27;s fictional animal character.

An African-American version was recorded as &quot;We&#x27;ll hang Jeff Davis from a sour apple tree&quot;. Similarly, a fight song at the University of Pennsylvania set to the same melody begins, &quot;Hang Jeff Davis from a sour apple tree&quot;.

As a common soccer chant, it is generally called &quot;Glory Glory&quot;.
The famous German children&#x27;s song (&quot;All the children are learning how to read&quot;) is also based on this melody.

A version of the song was also sung by French paratroopers: meaning &quot;yes, we&#x27;ll get our skulls broken in choir / but we&#x27;ll come back victorious&quot;.

In Sri Lanka it was adapted into a bilingual (English and Sinhala) song sung at cricket matches—notably at the Royal-Thomian, with the lyrics &quot;We&#x27;ll hang all the Thomians on the cadju-puhulang tree&quot;. Another adaptation sung at the annual match between the Colombo Law and Medical colleges went &quot;Liquor arsenalis and the cannabis indica&quot;. This was adapted into a trilingual song by Sooty Banda.

The music is used for a German-language children&#x27;s song by Frank und seine Freunde called translated to &quot;All Children Learn to Read&quot;.

Len Chandler sang a song called &quot;Move on over&quot; to the tune on Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Quest&quot; TV show.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics used with the &quot;John Brown&quot; tune generally increase in complexity and syllable count as they move from a simple, orally transmitted camp meeting song to an orally composed marching song to more consciously literary versions.

The increasing syllable count led to an ever-increasing number of dotted rhythms in the melody to accommodate the increased number of syllables. The result is that the verse and chorus, which were musically identical in &quot;Say, Brothers&quot;, became quite distinct rhythmically—though still identical in melodic profile—in &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;.

The trend towards ever more elaborate rhythmic variations of the original melody became even more pronounced in the later versions of the &quot;John Brown Song&quot; and in the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, which have far more words and syllables per verse than the early versions. The extra words and syllables are fit in by adding more dotted rhythms to the melody and by including four separate lines in each verse rather than repeating the first line three times. The result is that in these later versions the verse and the chorus became even more distinct rhythmically and poetically though still remaining identical in their underlying melodic profile.

===&quot;Say, Brothers&quot;===
===&quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; (a number of versions closely similar to this published in 1861)===

====Version of William Weston Patton====
William Weston Patton, an influential abolitionist and pastor, composed his &quot;The New John Brown Song&quot; in the fall of 1861 and published it in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, December 16, 1861:

====Version of Pete Seeger====
Pete Seeger, an American folk musician, recorded a version of John Brown&#x27;s Body in 1959 that is widely circulated today. The lyrics differ significantly from earlier versions, and include a stanza from Battle Hymn Of The Republic, itself an 1862 adaptation of John Brown&#x27;s Body written by abolitionist Julia Ward Howe.

<text>Wilfred Gordon &quot;Bill&quot; Bigelow (June 18, 1913 – March 27, 2005) was a Canadian heart surgeon known for his role in developing the artificial pacemaker and the use of hypothermia in open heart surgery.

Born in Brandon, Manitoba, the son of Dr. Wilfred Abram Bigelow, founder of the first private medical clinic in Canada, and Grace Ann Gordon, nurse and midwife, he gained his MD from the University of Toronto in 1938. He served during World War II as a captain in the Royal Canadian Medical Army Corps, performing battle surgery on the frontlines. He was appointed to the surgical staff of Toronto General Hospital in 1947, after spending a year at Johns Hopkins Medical School, and then a year later to the Department of Surgery at the University of Toronto in 1948.

In the 1950s, Bigelow developed the idea of using hypothermia as a medical procedure. This involves reducing a patient&#x27;s body temperature prior to an operation in order to reduce the amount of oxygen needed, making heart operations safer.

He wrote two books, &quot;Cold Hearts&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Heparin&quot;. He served as a director of the Audubon Society and the Nature Conservancy of Canada.

In 1981 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in 1997.

He was married to Ruth Jennings for almost 60 years. They had four children; Pixie, John, Dan and Bill.

<text>Nicholas Meyer (born December 24, 1945) is an American screenwriter, director and author known for his best-selling novel &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, and for directing the films &quot;Time After Time&quot;, two of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; feature films, the 1983 television film &quot;The Day After&quot;, and the 1999 HBO original film &quot;Vendetta&quot;.

Meyer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for the film &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; (1976), where he adapted his own novel into a screenplay. He has also been nominated for a Satellite Award, three Emmy Awards, and has won four Saturn Awards. He appeared as himself during the 2017 On Cinema spinoff series &quot;The Trial&quot;, during which he testified about &quot;Star Trek&quot; and San Francisco.

==Early life==
Meyer was born in New York City, to a Jewish family. He is the son of Bernard Constant Meyer (1910–1988), a Manhattan psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, and his first wife, concert pianist Elly (died 1960; née Kassman). He has three sisters. Meyer graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in theater and filmmaking, and also wrote film reviews for the campus newspaper.

==Career==
===Author===
Meyer first gained public attention for his best-selling 1974 Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, a story of Holmes confronting his cocaine addiction with the help of Sigmund Freud.

Meyer followed this with four additional Holmes novels: &quot;The West End Horror&quot; (1976), &quot;The Canary Trainer&quot; (1993), &quot;The Adventure of the Peculiar Protocols&quot; (2019), and &quot;The Return of the Pharaoh&quot; (2021).

Meyer has said that &quot;The Adventure of the Peculiar Protocols&quot; was inspired by Steven Zipperstein&#x27;s &quot;.&quot;

===Writer/Director===
&quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; was later adapted as a 1976 film of the same name, for which Meyer wrote the screenplay. The film was directed by Herbert Ross and starred Nicol Williamson, Robert Duvall, Alan Arkin and Laurence Olivier. For his work adapting the novel, Meyer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 49th Academy Awards.

Intrigued by the first part of college friend Karl Alexander&#x27;s then-incomplete novel &quot;Time After Time&quot;, Meyer optioned the book and adapted it into a screenplay. He consented to sell the script only if he were attached as director. The deal was optioned by Warner Bros., and the film became Meyer&#x27;s directorial debut. Meyer freely allowed Alexander to borrow from the screenplay. The latter published his novel at about the same time the movie was released.

&quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979) starred Malcolm McDowell, Mary Steenburgen and David Warner. It was a critical and commercial success.

Meyer next &quot;wanted to make a film of the Robertson Davies novel, &quot;Fifth Business&quot;. And I had written the screenplay. And nobody was interested in doing this.&quot; At the behest of then Paramount executive Karen Moore, he was hired to direct &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;.

Meyer later directed the 1983 television film &quot;The Day After&quot;, starring Jason Robards, JoBeth Williams, John Cullum, Bibi Besch, John Lithgow and Steve Guttenberg, which depicted the ramifications of a nuclear attack on the United States. Meyer had originally decided not to do any television work, but changed his mind upon reading the script by Edward Hume. For his work on &quot;The Day After&quot;, Meyer was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Director. Afterward, he also directed &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;, a 1985 episode of the television series &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;.

He resumed directing theatrical films with the 1985 comedy &quot;Volunteers&quot;, starring Tom Hanks and John Candy. He then returned to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, co-writing the screenplay for &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986) with producer Harve Bennett.

In 1986 Meyer helped James Dearden write the screenplay for &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, based on a short movie Dearden made in 1980 called &quot;Diversion&quot;. In Meyer&#x27;s book &quot;The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood&quot;, he explains that in late 1986 producer Stanley R. Jaffe asked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions for the script including a new ending for the movie. A few weeks later he met with director Adrian Lyne and gave him some additional suggestions.

Meyer&#x27;s next directing job was the 1988 Merchant Ivory produced drama &quot;The Deceivers&quot;, with Pierce Brosnan as British officer William Savage. Meyer later wrote and directed the 1991 spy comedy &quot;Company Business&quot;, starring Gene Hackman and Mikhail Baryshnikov as aging American and Russian secret agents. In 1991, Meyer once again returned to the world of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, co-writing and directing &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, which became a swan song for the original cast. Meyer performed uncredited rewrites on an early draft of the screenplay of the 1997 James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;.

Meyer adapted the Philip Roth novel &quot;The Human Stain&quot; into the 2003 film of the same name. In 2006, he teamed with Martin Scorsese to write the screenplay for Scorsese&#x27;s adaptation of Edmund Morris&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize winning biography of Theodore Roosevelt, &quot;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt&quot;. The story traces Roosevelt&#x27;s early life.

The two part, four hour, History Channel event miniseries, &quot;Houdini&quot;, starring Adrien Brody, aired over Labor Day 2014. Meyer&#x27;s script was nominated for a WGA award and the series was nominated for seven Emmys.

In 2016, he co-created the Italian-British series &quot;&quot; with Frank Spotnitz for Italian TV channel Rai 1, and wrote the first two episodes of season one.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
Meyer, along with writer/producer Harve Bennett, is one of two people credited with revitalizing and perhaps saving the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise after the problems of the first film, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, almost caused Paramount Pictures to end the series. Paramount had been unhappy with the creative direction of the first film, as well as the cost overruns and production problems. However, the film was also a great financial success, and they wanted a sequel. Bennett, a reliable television producer, was hired to help.

Introduced to Bennett by Paramount executive Karen Moore, Meyer was hired as a potential director for &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; despite never having seen the first film. Due to problems with the early drafts of the script, which most readers disliked, Meyer quickly became involved in re-writing the film&#x27;s screenplay. After meeting with Bennett and other cast members and crew members regarding the script, Meyer impressed &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors and producers by delivering a superior script draft in only twelve days. The draft had to be completed so quickly that Meyer agreed to forgo negotiating a contract or credit for his writing to begin work on the script immediately. As a result, he is uncredited as a writer on the final film.

Meyer made stylistic alterations in his direction, such as adding more of a naval appearance to the production. Meyer and Bennett created an engaging film while also reducing costs and avoiding the production fiascoes of the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; film. &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; became a financial success, grossing $78 million in the domestic market, and is considered by many to be the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; film to date.

Although he &quot;refuse[d] to specialize&quot; and so vowed to not work on another &quot;Star Trek&quot; project, Meyer co-wrote the screenplay for the fourth &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; with Bennett. For that film, Bennett wrote the first and third acts, which occur in the 23rd century, and Meyer wrote the second act, which occurs in 1986 San Francisco. Meyer has said that one of the most enjoyable aspects of working on this film was getting the chance to re-use elements which he had been forced to discard from his earlier film, &quot;Time After Time&quot;. &quot;Star Trek IV&quot; proved to be successful financially, notable for succeeding with general moviegoers as well as science fiction and &quot;Star Trek&quot; devotees.

Meyer worked for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise again for the sixth film in the series, &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991). He developed the story with Leonard Nimoy and co-wrote the screenplay with long-time friend and assistant Denny Flinn. He directed the picture, which was the final film to feature the entire classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast. Like its predecessors, this film was successful financially, grossing $74 million in the domestic market. Many of Meyer&#x27;s personal papers from his involvement with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise are housed at the University of Iowa Libraries.

In February 2016 it was announced that Meyer would be returning to &quot;Star Trek&quot; by joining the writing team for CBS&#x27;s new TV series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. In November 2018, Meyer announced in an online interview that he was not invited back for &quot;Discovery&quot;″s second season. He also disclosed that he could not identify his precise contributions, as television is such a collaborative medium.

In 2020, Meyer wrote a detailed proposal with his producing partner Steven-Charles Jaffe for a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; project, including a treatment and illustrations. Meyer said the project was not connected to any of the franchise&#x27;s previous films and was set in a gap in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; timeline where an original story could be told with new characters. He described the project as a feature film, but said it could also be a television series or a combination of television and film. Meyer and Jaffe presented this proposal to &quot;Star Trek&quot; television producer Alex Kurtzman, Abrams, and Watts, but had not heard anything back from Paramount by March 2021. At that time, Paramount set &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; writer Kalinda Vazquez to write the script for a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, based on her own original idea, with Abrams&#x27;s Bad Robot producing.

==Personal life==
Meyer was married to Lauren Taylor Meyer in the late 1980s and they had two daughters, Rachel (b Dec 1986) and Madeleine (b 1990). Meyer&#x27;s daughter Rachel, now known as screenwriter Dylan Meyer, is the fiancée of actress and filmmaker Kristen Stewart. In 2023, Nicholas Meyer won the Future of Life Award for reducing the risk of nuclear war through the power of storytelling.

<doc id="312600" wikidata="Q2669580" url="?curid=312600" title="10-Yard Fight">
<text>is an American football video game that was developed and published in Japan by Irem for arcades in 1983. It was published overseas by Taito in the Americas, by Electrocoin in Europe, and by ADP Automaten GmbH in West Germany.

==Gameplay==

&quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempts to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the long distance receiver, basically the option offense. On defense, the player picks one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.

The game has five levels of increasing difficulty: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an &quot;accelerated real time&quot; 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advances to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.

A player scores 20,000 points for any kickoff that is returned for a touchdown.

==Ports==
The arcade game was later published to the Famicom by Irem first in Japan, and later in North America and Europe by Nintendo in 1985 and 1986 respectively for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The arcade game was also ported to the MSX home computer by Irem, but exclusively in Japan.

While graphically similar, there are some fundamental differences between the arcade and NES versions of the game. The arcade version only seeks to simulate the offense, with the team attempting to score a touchdown, which ultimately leads the player to the next level. The NES version was developed to allow both defense and offense, as well as a simultaneous 2-player mode.

&quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; was, along with &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, one of only two NES launch titles not originally developed by Nintendo. Both games were developed initially for arcades by Irem. Although Nintendo developed the NES port of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, Irem handled the system&#x27;s port of &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot;.

The arcade version was released in May 2018 by Hamster Corporation as part of their Arcade Archives series.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; on their January 1, 1984 issue as the top-grossing new table arcade cabinet of the month. It later topped Japan&#x27;s table arcade game chart in March 1984.

The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; called it the &quot;patriarch of football games&quot;. Adam Duerson of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; stated that while no one remembered it or could say what makes it great, it is worth recognition for the fact that it brought football games out of the Atari era, setting a simple precedent for future football games. Adam Swiderski of UGO Networks called it &quot;downright advanced&quot; compared to earlier football titles. He added that while it looked neat and had a quality soundtrack, it didn&#x27;t play like &quot;real football&quot;. N-Sider called it more like a racing game than a football game, due to the objective being to race for a first down to increase players&#x27; time. Author Bj Klein, however, called it less realistic than &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot;. &quot;The Journal News&quot; called it an &quot;immortal classic&quot;.

<doc id="312603" wikidata="Q583210" url="?curid=312603" title="Battle Hymn of the Republic">
<text>The &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; is an American patriotic song written by the abolitionist writer Julia Ward Howe during the American Civil War.

Howe adapted her song from the soldiers&#x27; song &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; in November 1861, and sold it for $4 to &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in February 1862. In contrast to the lyrics of the soldiers’ song, her version links the Union cause with God&#x27;s vengeance at the Day of Judgment (through allusions to biblical passages such as , Revelation 19 and ).

Julia Ward Howe was married to Samuel Gridley Howe, a scholar in education of the blind. Both Samuel and Julia were also active leaders in anti-slavery politics and strong supporters of the Union. Samuel was a member of the Secret Six, the group who funded John Brown&#x27;s work.

==History==

===&quot;Oh! Brothers&quot;===
The tune and some of the lyrics of &quot;John Brown’s Body&quot; came from a much older folk hymn called &quot;Say, Brothers will you Meet Us&quot;, also known as &quot;Glory Hallelujah&quot;, which has been developed in the oral hymn tradition of revivalist camp meetings of the late 1700s, though it was first published in the early 1800s. In the first known version, &quot;Canaan&#x27;s Happy Shore&quot;, the text includes the verse &quot;Oh! Brothers will you meet me (3×)/On Canaan&#x27;s happy shore?&quot; and chorus &quot;There we&#x27;ll shout and give Him glory (3×)/For glory is His own.&quot; This developed into the familiar &quot;Glory, glory, hallelujah&quot; chorus by the 1850s. The tune and variants of these words spread across both the southern and northern United States.

===As the &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; song===
At a flag-raising ceremony at Fort Warren, near Boston, Massachusetts, on Sunday, May 12, 1861, the song &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;, using the &quot;Oh! Brothers&quot; tune and the &quot;Glory, Hallelujah&quot; chorus, was publicly played &quot;perhaps for the first time&quot;. The American Civil War had begun the previous month.

In 1890, George Kimball wrote his account of how the 2nd Infantry Battalion of the Massachusetts militia, known as the &quot;Tiger&quot; Battalion, collectively worked out the lyrics to &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;. Kimball wrote:

According to Kimball, these sayings became by-words among the soldiers and, in a communal effort—similar in many ways to the spontaneous composition of camp meeting songs described above—were gradually put to the tune of &quot;Say, Brothers&quot;:

Some leaders of the battalion, feeling the words were coarse and irreverent, tried to urge the adoption of more fitting lyrics, but to no avail. The lyrics were soon prepared for publication by members of the battalion, together with publisher C. S. Hall. They selected and polished verses they felt appropriate, and may even have enlisted the services of a local poet to help polish and create verses.

The official histories of the old First Artillery and of the 55th Artillery (1918) also record the Tiger Battalion&#x27;s role in creating the John Brown Song, confirming the general thrust of Kimball&#x27;s version with a few additional details.

===Creation of the &quot;Battle Hymn&quot;===
Kimball&#x27;s battalion was dispatched to Murray, Kentucky, early in the Civil War, and Julia Ward Howe heard this song during a public review of the troops outside Washington, D.C., on Upton Hill, Virginia. Rufus R. Dawes, then in command of Company &quot;K&quot; of the 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry, stated in his memoirs that the man who started the singing was Sergeant John Ticknor of his company. Howe&#x27;s companion at the review, the Reverend James Freeman Clarke, suggested to Howe that she write new words for the fighting men&#x27;s song. Staying at the Willard Hotel in Washington on the night of November 18, 1861, Howe wrote the verses to the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. Of the writing of the lyrics, Howe remembered:

Howe&#x27;s &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; was first published on the front page of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; of February 1862. The sixth verse written by Howe, which is less commonly sung, was not published at that time.

The song was also published as a broadside in 1863 by the Supervisory Committee for Recruiting Colored Regiments in Philadelphia.

Both &quot;John Brown&quot; and &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; were published in Father Kemp&#x27;s &quot;Old Folks Concert Tunes&quot; in 1874 and reprinted in 1889. Both songs had the same chorus with an additional &quot;Glory&quot; in the second line: &quot;Glory! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!&quot;

==Score==
&quot;Canaan&#x27;s Happy Shore&quot; has a verse and chorus of equal metrical length and both verse and chorus share an identical melody and rhythm. &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; has more syllables in its verse and uses a more rhythmically active variation of the &quot;Canaan&quot; melody to accommodate the additional words in the verse. In Howe&#x27;s lyrics, the words of the verse are packed into a yet longer line, with even more syllables than &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body.&quot; The verse still uses the same underlying melody as the refrain, but the addition of many dotted rhythms to the underlying melody allows for the more complex verse to fit the same melody as the comparatively short refrain.

:&quot;One version of the melody, in C major, begins as below. This is an example of the mediant-octave modal frame.&quot;

Howe submitted the lyrics she wrote to &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and it was first published in the February 1862 issue of the magazine.

===First published version===
* Some modern performances and recordings of the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; use the lyric &quot;As He died to make men holy, let us &quot;live&quot; to make men free&quot; as opposed to the wartime lyric originally written by Julia Ward Howe: &quot;let us die to make men free.&quot;

===Other versions===
Howe&#x27;s original manuscript differed slightly from the published version. Most significantly, it included a final verse:

In the 1862 sheet music, the chorus always begins:

==Recordings and public performances==


* In 1953, Marian Anderson sang the song before a television audience of 60 million persons, broadcast live over the NBC and CBS networks, as part of &quot;The Ford 50th Anniversary Show&quot;.
*In 1960 the Mormon Tabernacle Choir won the Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group or Chorus. The 45 rpm single record, which was arranged and edited by Columbia Records and Cleveland disk jockey Bill Randle, was a commercial success and reached #13 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 the previous autumn. It is the choir&#x27;s only Top 40 hit in the Hot 100.
*Judy Garland performed this song on her weekly television show in December 1963. She originally wanted to do a dedication show for President John F. Kennedy upon his assassination, but CBS would not let her, so she performed the song without being able to mention his name.
*On November 22, 1963, the day that President John F Kennedy was assassinated the Mormon Tabernacle Choir performed the Battle Hymn Of The Republic live on national television.
*Andy Williams experienced commercial success in 1968 with an a cappella version recorded at Senator Robert Kennedy&#x27;s funeral. Backed by the St. Charles Borromeo choir, his version reached #11 on the adult contemporary chart and #33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
*Anita Bryant performed it January 17, 1971, at the halftime show of Super Bowl V. She would also do it again on January 25, 1973, during the burial services for LBJ at his Texas ranch.
*The Morehouse College Glee Club performed it at Former President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s funeral ceremony at the Carter Center in Atlanta on January 4, 2025.
*U.S. Naval Academy Glee Club performed it January 20, 2025 at Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration ceremony at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC.

==Influence==
===Popularity and widespread use===
In the years since the Civil War, &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; has been used frequently as an American patriotic song.

===Cultural influences===
The lyrics of &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; appear in Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s sermons and speeches, most notably in his speech &quot;How Long, Not Long&quot; from the steps of the Alabama State Capitol building on March 25, 1965, after the successful Selma to Montgomery march, and in his final sermon &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to the Mountaintop&quot;, delivered in Memphis, Tennessee, on the evening of April 3, 1968, the night before his assassination. The speech ends with the first lyrics of the &quot;Battle Hymn&quot;: &quot;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.&quot;

Bishop Michael B. Curry of North Carolina, after his election as the first African American Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church, delivered a sermon to the Church&#x27;s General Convention on July 3, 2015, in which the lyrics of the &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; framed the message of God&#x27;s love. After proclaiming &quot;Glory, glory, hallelujah, His truth is marching on&quot;, a letter from President Barack Obama was read, congratulating Bishop Curry on his historic election. Curry is known for quoting the &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; during his sermons.

The tune has played a role in many movies where patriotic music has been required, including the 1970 World War II war comedy &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and the 1999 sci-fi western &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. Words from the first verse gave John Steinbeck&#x27;s wife Carol Steinbeck the title of his 1939 masterpiece &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. The title of John Updike&#x27;s &quot;In the Beauty of the Lilies&quot; also came from this song, as did &quot;Terrible Swift Sword&quot; and &quot;Never Call Retreat&quot;, two volumes in Bruce Catton&#x27;s &quot;Centennial History of the Civil War&quot;. &quot;Terrible Swift Sword&quot; is also the name of a board wargame simulating the Battle of Gettysburg.

The opening line of the song is referenced in The Smiths&#x27; 1983 song &quot;These Things Take Time,&quot; where it is quoted as &quot;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind&quot;.

Words from the second last line of the last verse are paraphrased in Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Steer Your Way&quot;. It was originally published as a poem in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. &quot;As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free&quot; becomes &quot;As He died to make men holy, let us die to make things cheap&quot;.

=== In association with football/soccer ===

The refrain &quot;Glory, glory, hallelujah!&quot; has been adopted by fans of a number of sporting teams, most notably in the English and Scottish Premier Leagues. The popular use of the tune by Tottenham Hotspur can be traced to September 1961 during the 1961–62 European Cup. Their first opponents in the competition were the Polish side Górnik Zabrze, and the Polish press described the Spurs team as &quot;no angels&quot; due to their rough tackling. In the return leg at White Hart Lane, some fans then wore angel costumes at the match holding placards with slogans such as &quot;Glory be to shining White Hart Lane&quot;, and the crowded started singing the refrain &quot;Glory, glory, hallelujah&quot; as Spurs beat the Poles 8–1, starting the tradition at Tottenham. It was released as the B-side to &quot;Ossie&#x27;s Dream&quot; for the 1981 FA Cup final.

The theme was then picked up by Hibernian, with Hector Nicol&#x27;s release of the track &quot;Glory, glory to the Hibees&quot; in 1963. &quot;Glory, Glory Leeds United&quot; was a popular chant during Leeds&#x27; 1969–70 FA Cup run all the way to the final. Manchester United fans picked it up as &quot;Glory, Glory Man United&quot; prior to the 1983 FA Cup final. 

&quot;We&#x27;re not Brazil, we&#x27;re Northern Ireland&quot; is a self-deprecating song popular with fans of the Northern Ireland football team. The words by Stewart McAfee celebrate the team&#x27;s historic successes (&quot;Mine eyes have seen the glory of España &#x27;82&quot;), whilst acknowledging in a witty way that it is not among the giants of world football. A studio recording sung by the team and featuring local broadcasters George Jones and Jackie Fullerton was released in 2006.

As a result of its popularity with these and other British teams, use of the tune has spread internationally and to other sporting codes. An example of its reach is its popularity with fans of the Australian Rugby League team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs (Glory, Glory to South Sydney) and to A-League Men team Perth Glory. Brighton fans celebrate their 1970s legend by singing &quot;Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord, he played for Brighton and Hove Albion and his name is Peter Ward&quot;.

===Other songs set to this tune===
Some songs make use of both the melody and elements of the lyrics of &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, either in tribute or as a parody:

* &quot;Marching Song of the First Arkansas&quot; is a Civil War–era song that has a similar lyrical structure to &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. It has been described as &quot;a powerful early statement of black pride, militancy, and desire for full equality, revealing the aspirations of black soldiers for Reconstruction as well as anticipating the spirit of the civil rights movement of the 1960s&quot;.
* The tune has been used with alternative lyrics numerous times. The University of Georgia&#x27;s rally song, &quot;Glory Glory to Old Georgia&quot;, is based on the patriotic tune, and has been sung at American college football games since 1909. Other college teams also use songs set to the same tune. One such is &quot;Glory, Glory to Old Auburn&quot; at Auburn University. Another is &quot;Glory Colorado&quot;, traditionally played by the band and sung after touchdowns scored by the Colorado Buffaloes. &quot;Glory Colorado&quot; has been a fight song at the University of Colorado (Boulder) for more than one hundred years.
* In 1901 Mark Twain wrote &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic, Updated&quot;, with the same tune as the original, as a comment on the Philippine–American War. It was later recorded by the Chad Mitchell Trio.
* &quot;The Burning of the School&quot; is a well-known parody of the song.
* The United States Army paratrooper song, &quot;Blood on the Risers&quot;, first sung in World War II, includes the lyrics &quot;Gory, gory&quot; in the lyrics, based on the original&#x27;s &quot;Glory, glory&quot;.
* A number of terrace songs (in association football) are sung to the tune in Britain. Most frequently, fans chant &quot;Glory, Glory...&quot; plus their team&#x27;s name: the chants have been recorded and released officially as songs by Hibernian, Tottenham, Leeds United and Manchester United. The 1994 World Cup official song &quot;Gloryland&quot; interpreted by Daryl Hall and the Sounds of Blackness has the tune of &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. In Argentina the St. Alban&#x27;s former Pupils Assn (Old Philomathian Club) used the tune for its &quot;Glory Glory Philomathians&quot; as well. While not heard often nowadays it is still a cherished song for the Old Philomathians.
* In Australia, the song is used by rugby league club the South Sydney Rabbitohs – &quot;Glory Glory to South Sydney&quot;. Each verse ends with, &quot;They wear the Red and Green&quot;.
* The parody song &quot;Jesus Can&#x27;t Play Rugby&quot;, popular at informal sporting events, uses the traditional melody under improvised lyrics. Performances typically feature a call-and-response structure, wherein one performer proposes an amusing reason why Jesus Christ might be disqualified from playing rugby—e.g. &quot;Jesus can&#x27;t play rugby &#x27;cause his dad will rig the game&quot;—which is then repeated back by other participants (mirroring the repetitive structure of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;), before ending with the tongue-in-cheek proclamation &quot;Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves&quot;. A chorus may feature the repeated call of &quot;Free beer for all the ruggers&quot;, or, after concluding the final verse, &quot;Jesus, we&#x27;re only kidding&quot;.
** A variant of this version is popular at Hash House Harrier events, proposing reasons why Jesus might be disqualified from running a hash trail—e.g. &quot;Jesus can&#x27;t go Hashing &#x27;cause the flour falls through his hands&quot; or “Jesus can’t go Hashing ‘cause he turns the beer to wine”. The chorus is similarly changed to &quot;Free beer for all the Hashers&quot;, and finally &quot;Jesus, we&#x27;re only kidding&quot;.
* A protest song titled &quot;Gloria, Gloria Labandera&quot; (lit. &quot;Gloria the Laundrywoman&quot;) was used by supporters of former Philippine president Joseph Estrada to mock Gloria Macapagal Arroyo after the latter assumed the presidency following Estrada&#x27;s ouster from office, further deriving the &quot;labandera&quot; parallels to alleged money laundering. While Arroyo did not mind the nickname and went on to use it for her projects, the Catholic Church took umbrage to the parody lyrics and called it &quot;obscene&quot;.
* The song &quot;The White Man Marches On&quot; is a rendition using the same melody, written by white supremacist Johnny Rebel. This version contains explicit racist and antisemitic lyrics. It is famously know for having been used in a scene of the 1998 film &quot;American History X&quot; 
* Former Christian singer Audrey Assad recorded a rewritten version in 2019 called &quot;Your Peace Will Make Us One&quot;, keeping the religious themes but removing the violent references.

Other songs simply use the melody, i.e. the melody of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;, with no lyrical connection to &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;:

* &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;, a marching song for organized labor in the 20th century.
* The anthem of the American consumers&#x27; cooperative movement, &quot;The Battle Hymn of Cooperation&quot;, written in 1932.
* The tune has been used as a marching song in the Finnish military with the words &quot;&quot;Kalle-Kustaan muori makaa hiljaa haudassaan, ja yli haudan me marssimme näin&quot; (&quot;Carl Gustaf&#x27;s hag lies silently in her grave, and we&#x27;re marching over the grave like this&quot;).
* The Finnish Ice Hockey fans can be heard singing the tune with the lyrics &quot;Suomi tekee kohta maalin, eikä kukaan sille mitään voi&quot; (&quot;Finland will soon score, and no one can do anything about it&quot;).
* The Estonian song &quot;Kalle Kusta&quot; uses the melody as well.
* The Swedish drinking song (lit. &quot;Limping Lotta&quot;) – referring to a pub in Gothenburg – uses the melody. The song tells how much a drink is worth at the pub in question (either 8 or 15 öre, depending on the version), how one can pay with kisses if one cannot afford a drink, how the recipient of these kisses is the landlady&#x27;s sister given that the landlady is dead, where the landlady is buried and how her grave is desecrated by urinating dogs and how her body decays, eventually leading to the nationalization of the pub, which drives the prices up to 50 öre.
* The folk dance &quot;Gólya&quot; (&quot;Stork&quot;), known in several Hungarian-speaking communities in Transylvania (Romania), as well as in Hungary proper, is set to the same tune. The same dance is found among the Csángós of Moldavia with a different tune, under the name &quot;Hojna&quot;; with the Moldavian melody generally considered original, and the &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; tune a later adaptation.
* The melody is used in French Canadian Christmas carol called &quot;Glory, Alleluia&quot;, covered by Celine Dion and others.
* The melody is used in the marching song of the Assam Regiment of the Indian Army: &quot;Badluram Ka Badan&quot;, or &quot;Badluram&#x27;s Body&quot;, its chorus being &quot;Shabash Hallelujah&quot; instead of &quot;Glory Hallelujah&quot;. The word &quot;Shabash&quot; in Hindustani means &quot;congratulations&quot; or &quot;well done&quot;.
* The song &quot;Belfast Brigade&quot; using alternate lyrics is sung by the Lucky4 in support of the Irish Republican Army.
* The song &quot;Up Went Nelson&quot;, celebrating the destruction of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar in Dublin, is sung to this tune.
* The Discordian Handbook &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; has a version of the song called Battle Hymn of the Eristocracy. It has been recorded for example by Aarni.
* The Subiaco Football Club, in the West Australian Football League, uses the song for their team song. Also, the Casey Demons in the Victorian Football League also currently use the song. The words have been adjusted due to the song mainly being written during the period of time they were called the Casey Scorpions and the Springvale Football Club. As well as these two clubs, the West Torrens Football Club used the song until 1990, when their successor club, Woodville-West Torrens, currently use this song in the South Australian National Football League. The Broadbeach Cats also employ this melody for their theme song. Clarence Kangaroos and Wanderer Eagles use this as well.
* The Brisbane Bears, before they merged with the Fitzroy Football Club, used the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; in experiment mode before eventually scrapping it in favour of the original song.
* The melody is used in the well-known Dutch children&#x27;s song &quot;Lief klein konijntje&quot;. The song is about a cute little rabbit that has a fly on his nose. The British adaptation of the lyrics is thought to be &quot;Little Peter Rabbit&quot;.
* The melody is used as the theme for the Japanese electronics chain Yodobashi Camera.
* The melody is used in several Japanese nursery rhymes, including ともだち讃歌 (&quot;Tomodachi Sanka&quot;) and ごんべさんの赤ちゃん (&quot;Gonbei-san no aka-chan&quot;).
*The melody has been used as a fight song in Queen&#x27;s University, named &quot;Oil Thigh&quot;.
*The melody is used as Christmas carols in Indonesia, named &quot;Nunga Jumpang Muse Ari Pesta I&quot; in Batak Toba language, &quot;Sendah Jumpa Kita Wari Raya E&quot; in Karo language and &quot;Sudah Tiba Hari Raya Yang Kudus&quot; in Indonesian (all three translate as &quot;Christmas Day is Coming&quot;).
*The melody is used in &quot;Hãy tiếp tục đoàn kết với Việt Nam&quot; (Let&#x27;s continue to unite with Vietnam), a song about Sino-Vietnamese war of 1979
*The melody is used in Godiva&#x27;s Hymn, a traditional drinking song for North American Engineers

===Other settings of the text===
Irish composer Ina Boyle set the text for solo soprano, mixed choir and orchestra; she completed her version in 1918.
The British Methodist Hymn Book used in the mid 20th century had Walford Davies&#x27;s &quot;Vision&quot; as the first tune, and the &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; as the second tune.

The progressive metal band Dream Theater utilise the lyrics of the Battle Hymn of the Republic at the end of their song &quot;In the Name of God&quot;, the final song on their 2003 album Train of Thought.

<doc id="312605" wikidata="Q42317814" url="?curid=312605" title="Government budget balance">
<text>The government budget balance, also referred to as the general government balance, public budget balance, or public fiscal balance, is the difference between government revenues and spending. For a government that uses accrual accounting (rather than cash accounting) the budget balance is calculated using only spending on current operations, with expenditure on new capital assets excluded. A positive balance is called a &quot;government budget surplus&quot;, and a negative balance is a &quot;government budget deficit&quot;. A government budget presents the government&#x27;s proposed revenues and spending for a financial year.

The government budget balance can be broken down into the &quot;primary balance&quot; and interest payments on accumulated government debt; the two together give the budget balance. Furthermore, the budget balance can be broken down into the &quot;structural balance&quot; (also known as &quot;cyclically-adjusted balance&quot;) and the cyclical component: the structural budget balance attempts to adjust for the impact of cyclical changes in real GDP, in order to indicate the longer-run budgetary situation.

The government budget surplus or deficit is a flow variable, since it is an amount per unit of time (typically, per year). Thus it is distinct from government debt, which is a stock variable since it is measured at a specific point in time. The cumulative flow of deficits equals the stock of debt when a government employs cash accounting (though not under accrual accounting).

== Sectoral balances ==
The government fiscal balance is one of three major sectoral balances in the national economy, the others being the foreign sector and the private sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by definition. For example, if there is a foreign financial surplus (or capital surplus) because capital is imported (net) to fund the trade deficit, and there is also a private sector financial surplus due to household saving exceeding business investment, then by definition, there must exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes federal, state and local governments. For example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a capital surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.

Financial journalist Martin Wolf argued that sudden shifts in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the government balance into deficit, and cited as example the U.S.: &quot;The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust.&quot;

Economist Paul Krugman explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private deficit to surplus: &quot;This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers.&quot;

The sectoral balances (also called sectoral financial balances) derive from the sectoral analysis framework for macroeconomic analysis of national economies developed by British economist Wynne Godley. 
GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the value of all goods and services produced within a country during one year. GDP measures flows rather than stocks (example: the public deficit is a flow, measured per unit of time, while the government debt is a stock, an accumulation). GDP can be expressed equivalently in terms of production or the types of newly produced goods purchased, as per the National Accounting relationship between aggregate spending and income:

:formula_1

where &quot;Y&quot; is GDP (production; equivalently, income), &quot;C&quot; is consumption spending, &quot;I&quot; is private investment spending, &quot;G&quot; is government spending on goods and services, &quot;X&quot; is exports and &quot;M&quot; is imports (so &quot;X&quot; – &quot;M&quot; is net exports).

Another perspective on the national income accounting is to note that households can allocate total income (Y) to the following uses:

:formula_2

where &quot;S&quot; is total saving and &quot;T&quot; is total taxation net of transfer payments.

Combining the two perspectives gives

:formula_3

Hence

:formula_4

This implies the accounting identity for the three sectoral balances – private domestic, government budget and external:

:formula_5

The sectoral balances equation says that total private saving (&quot;S&quot;) minus private investment (&quot;I&quot;) has to equal the public deficit (spending, &quot;G&quot;, minus net taxes, &quot;T&quot;) plus net exports (exports (&quot;X&quot;) minus imports (&quot;M&quot;)), where net exports is the net spending of non-residents on this country&#x27;s production. Thus total private saving equals private investment plus the public deficit plus net exports.

In macroeconomics, the Modern Money Theory describes any transactions between the government sector and the non-government sector as a vertical transaction. The government sector includes the treasury and the central bank, whereas the non-government sector includes private individuals and firms (including the private banking system) and the external sector – that is, foreign buyers and sellers.

In any given time period, the government&#x27;s budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. Sectoral balances analysis shows that as a matter of accounting, government budget deficits add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited, over the course of some time range, more money and bonds into private holdings than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money and bonds from private holdings via taxes than it has put back in via spending.

Therefore, budget deficits, by definition, are equivalent to adding net financial assets to the private sector, whereas budget surpluses remove financial assets from the private sector.

This is represented by the identity:

:formula_6

where &quot;NX&quot; is net exports. This implies that private net saving is only possible if the government runs budget deficits; alternately, the private sector is forced to dissave when the government runs a budget surplus.

According to the sectoral balances framework, budget surpluses offset net saving; in a time of high effective demand, this may lead to a private sector reliance on credit to finance consumption patterns. Hence, continual budget deficits are necessary for a growing economy that wants to avoid deflation. Therefore, budget surpluses are required only when the economy has excessive aggregate demand, and is in danger of inflation. If the government issues its own currency, MMT tells us that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government&#x27;s budget deficit or surplus) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment, and not a means of funding the government&#x27;s activities per se.

==Primary balance==
&quot;Primary balance&quot; is defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as government net borrowing or net lending, excluding interest payments on consolidated government liabilities.

==Primary deficit, total deficit, and debt==

The meaning of &quot;deficit&quot; differs from that of &quot;debt&quot;, which is an accumulation of yearly deficits. Deficits occur when a government&#x27;s expenditures exceed the revenue that it levies. The deficit can be measured with or without including the interest payments on the debt as expenditures.

The &quot;primary deficit&quot; is defined as the difference between current government spending on goods and services and total current revenue from all types of taxes net of transfer payments. The &quot;total deficit&quot; (which is often called the fiscal deficit or just the &#x27;deficit&#x27;) is the primary deficit plus interest payments on the debt.

Therefore, if formula_7 refers to an arbitrary year, formula_8 is government spending and formula_9 is tax revenue for the respective year, then
:formula_10

If formula_11 is last year&#x27;s debt (the debt accumulated up to and including last year), and formula_12 is the interest rate attached to the debt, then the total deficit for year &quot;t&quot; is
:formula_13

where the first term on the right side is interest payments on the outstanding debt.

Finally, this year&#x27;s debt can be calculated from last year&#x27;s debt and this year&#x27;s total deficit, using the government budget constraint:
:formula_14

That is, the debt after this year&#x27;s government operations equals what it was a year earlier plus this year&#x27;s total deficit, because the current deficit has to be financed by borrowing via the issuance of new bonds.

Economic trends can influence the growth or shrinkage of fiscal deficits in several ways. Increased levels of economic activity generally lead to higher tax revenues, while government expenditures often increase during economic downturns because of higher outlays for social insurance programs such as unemployment benefits. Changes in tax rates, tax enforcement policies, levels of social benefits, and other government policy decisions can also have major effects on public debt. For some countries, such as Norway, Russia, and members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), oil and gas receipts play a major role in public finances.

Inflation reduces the real value of accumulated debt. If investors anticipate future inflation, however, they will demand higher interest rates on government debt, making public borrowing more expensive.

==Structural deficits, cyclical deficits, and the fiscal gap==
A government deficit can be thought of as consisting of two elements, &quot;structural&quot; and &quot;cyclical&quot;. At the lowest point in the business cycle, there is a high level of unemployment. This means that tax revenues are low and expenditure (e.g., on social security) high. Conversely, at the peak of the cycle, unemployment is low, increasing tax revenue and decreasing social security spending. The additional borrowing required at the low point of the cycle is the &quot;cyclical deficit&quot;. By definition, the cyclical deficit will be entirely repaid by a cyclical surplus at the peak of the cycle.

The &quot;structural deficit&quot; is the deficit that remains across the business cycle, because the general level of government spending exceeds prevailing tax levels. The observed total budget deficit is equal to the sum of the structural deficit with the cyclical deficit or surplus.

Some economists have criticized the distinction between cyclical and structural deficits, contending that the business cycle is too difficult to measure to make cyclical analysis worthwhile.

The &quot;fiscal gap&quot;, a measure proposed by economists Alan Auerbach and Laurence Kotlikoff, measures the difference between government spending and revenues over the very long term, typically as a percentage of gross domestic product. The fiscal gap can be interpreted as the percentage increase in revenues or reduction of expenditures necessary to balance spending and revenues in the long run. For example, a fiscal gap of 5% could be eliminated by an immediate and permanent 5% increase in taxes or cut in spending or some combination of both.

It includes not only the structural deficit at a given point in time, but also the difference between promised future government commitments, such as health and retirement spending, and planned future tax revenues. Since the elderly population is growing much faster than the young population in many developed countries, many economists argue that these countries have important fiscal gaps, beyond what can be seen from their deficits alone.

==Early deficits==

Before the invention of bonds, the deficit could only be financed with loans from private investors or other countries. A prominent example of this was the Rothschild dynasty in the late 18th and 19th century, though there were many earlier examples (e.g. the Peruzzi family).

These loans became popular when private financiers had amassed enough capital to provide them, and when governments were no longer able to simply print money, with consequent inflation, to finance their spending.

Large long-term loans are risky for the lender, and therefore commanded high interest rates. To reduce their borrowing costs, governments began to issue bonds that were payable to the bearer (rather than the original purchaser) so that the lenders could sell on some or all of the debt to someone else. This innovation reduced the risk for the lenders, and so the government could offer a lower interest rate. Examples of bearer bonds are British Consols and American Treasury bill bonds.

==Deficit spending==

According to most economists, during recessions, the government can stimulate the economy by intentionally running a deficit. As Professor William Vickrey, awarded with the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences put it:

===Ricardian equivalence===
The Ricardian equivalence hypothesis, named after the English political economist and Member of Parliament David Ricardo, states that because households anticipate that current public deficit will be paid through future taxes, those households will accumulate savings now to offset those future taxes. If households acted in this way, a government would not be able to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy. The Ricardian equivalence result requires several assumptions. These include households acting as if they were infinite-lived dynasties as well as assumptions of no uncertainty and no liquidity constraints.

Also, for Ricardian equivalence to apply, the deficit spending would have to be permanent. In contrast, a one-time stimulus through deficit spending would suggest a lesser tax burden annually than the one-time deficit expenditure. Thus temporary deficit spending is still expansionary. Empirical evidence on Ricardian equivalence effects has been mixed.

===Crowding-out hypothesis===
The crowding-out hypothesis is the conjecture that when a government experiences a deficit, the choice to borrow to offset that deficit draws on the pool of resources available for investment, and private investment gets crowded out. This crowding-out effect is induced by changes in the interest rate. When the government wishes to borrow, its demand for credit increases and the interest rate, or price of credit, increases. This increase in the interest rate makes private investment more expensive as well and less of it is used.

== Determinants of government budget balance ==

=== Dependent variables ===
Dependent variables include budgetary variables, meaning deficits and debts, and nominal or cyclically adjusted data.

&quot;The debt ratio&quot;, either gross (without effect of the inflation) or net, is used as a wider measure of government actions rather than measure of government deficit. Nevertheless, government generally set their yearly budget aims in flow terms (deficits) rather than in stock terms (debts). This is partly because stock markets variables are harder to target as circumstances outside direct government control (e.g. economic growth, exchange rate changes and asset price changes) affect stock variables more than flow variables.

Concerning the &quot;nominal&quot; or &quot;cyclically adjusted data&quot;, the latter is preferable measure of the policy-related part of the budget and reduces the mutual partiality that may originate from the interaction between economic growth and budgets. However, there are serious warnings in estimating cyclically adjusted balances, especially defining trend/potential output.

=== Independent variables ===
Concerning factors clarifying variances in budgetary results, there are budgetary, macroeconomic, political, and dummy variables.

==== Budgetary variables ====
&quot;Debt-to-GDP ratio&quot; is used to characterise the long-run sustainability of government fiscal policy. Countries with very high debt-to-GDP ratio are considered to be more financially vulnerable during recessions, and due to it, their creditors demand higher interest rates on new loans or long-term loans with variable interest to cover the potential loses. This measure often even worsens country&#x27;s budget balance and increase the risk of country ending in insolvency or, in some cases, in bankruptcy.

&quot;Lagged budget balance&quot; means that past fiscal policy decisions done by government can influence the condition of public finances in the following years (e.g. huge government spending during COVID-19 pandemic in most developed countries).

==== Macroeconomic variables ====
&quot;Unemployment rate/output growth/output gap&quot; are variables measuring the responsibility of government practising fiscal policy to macroeconomic terms. They help government to understand the current economic situation and choose the correct policy to sustain economic prosperity.

&quot;Long-term and short-term interest rate&quot; both worsen the budget balance because they increase the amount states must pay on interests, therefore their budget expenditures. In addition, increase of interest rate is an important mean of monetary policy to regulate the inflation, which clears the value of debt.

&quot;Inflation&quot; is generally considered to affect the budget balance, but its effect is not a priori clear. During inflation, government is often forced to compensate its effect to ordinary people, which means more expenditures. On the other hand, if country is highly indebted, soaring inflation allows country to pay less real value of debt, or, in case of a deal with a creditor, pay it faster.

&quot;Asset prices&quot; may influence government budget both directly and indirectly and its influence on budget balance is dubious, similar to inflation. Budget may be directly affected via budgetary items, for instance by higher revenues from capital gains tax or wealth tax, or indirectly via second-round effects of asset prices, e.g. lower revenues from consumer tax because of lower amount of money, which can inhabitants spend on goods and services.

&quot;Welfare level&quot; has quite straightforward effect on budget balance, if it is supposed that low welfare states have higher budget deficits due to need to finance catching-up expenditures. However, Greece and Japan are considered as developed countries, but their debt is one of the highest in the world and any significant increase of interest rates would lead to huge financial problems, therefore this assumption is quite problematic.

==== Political variables ====
The economic institutions, among them those, which apply fiscal policy, are directly influenced by &quot;de jure&quot; (under the law) political power. Form of the state budget can be influenced by political instability (higher frequency of elections), political orientation of those possessing political power or by the way of doing budgetary process (degree of cooperation between authorities), which is examined in a field called political economy.

&quot;Election year&quot; has significant effect on budget balance, because before and after the elections, there is a tendency called political business cycle, referring to the fact that politicians tend to spend more money before and after the elections to please the voters. Due to it, there is a negative correlation between political stability and budget balance meaning the less political stability, the less balanced budget.

&quot;Government composition index&quot; refers to the political ideology of the government. It is generally supposed that left-wing parties are more-expenditure and deficit-prone than the right-wing parties. On the other hand, left-wing parties tend to set more &quot;socially just&quot; progressive tax rates, which in most cases increase tax revenues, therefore budget deficit is not that much higher than during the government of right-wing parties.

&quot;Type of government&quot; means if the government is single party or a coalition. A single party government does not have to deal with ideology disagreements like the coalition type of government. It is considered to be more active in enforcing new laws or measures and has more balanced budgets.

&quot;Fiscal governance&quot; is variable, that measures if the major budgetary powers have been allocated to the Minister of Finance (&quot;delegation&quot;), if the role of the Minister of Finance is to enforce pre-existing deal between other ministers (&quot;commitment&quot;), if spending decisions are made without discussion with other ministers (&quot;fiefdom&quot;) or if it is a combination of delegation and commitment (typology based on ).

&quot;Number of political parties&quot; refers to effective number of them in parliament, as a high number means requirement for large coalitions, increasing the probability of higher budget deficits. Limited number on the other land may lead to autocracy and loss of welfare influencing the budget balance, because democracy is key determinant of economic institutions, and therefore high economic welfare.

&quot;Overall political index&quot; measures quality of political institutions in a country, which are key determinant of quality economic institution, stating the higher the quality, the lower are expected deficits.

==== Dummy variables ====
Dummy variables are variables used mainly in Econometrics and Statistics to categorize data can only take one of two values (mostly 0 or 1). Here, it refers to events unique only for some parts of the world.

&quot;Run-up to EMU&quot; refers to the consolidation measures about the fiscal policy in European countries to qualify to the European monetary union (EMU), which were supposed to control government overspending. However, these criteria concerning maximum debt-to-GDP ratio and budget deficit are not evident to have some changing effect on budgets and debts of member states.

&quot;Country-specific and year dummies&quot; relate to unusual economic events, which have significant effect on state budget balance, country-specific dummies for example to the German unification in 1990 and year dummies to macroeconomic shocks not fully reflected in the variables, like oil shocks in 1970s or 11 September terrorist attacks.

==Potential policy solutions for unintended deficits==

===Increase taxes or reduce government spending===
If a reduction in a structural deficit is desired, either revenue must increase, spending must decrease, or both. Taxes may be increased for everyone/every entity across the board or lawmakers may decide to assign that tax burden to specific groups of people (higher-income individuals, businesses, etc.) Lawmakers may also decide to cut government spending.

Like with taxes, they could decide to cut the budgets of every government agency/entity by the same percentage or they may decide to give a greater budget cut to specific agencies. Many, if not all, of these decisions made by lawmakers are based on political ideology, popularity with their electorate, or popularity with their donors.

===Changes in tax code===
Similar to increasing taxes, changes can be made to the tax code that increases tax revenue. Closing tax loopholes and allowing fewer deductions are different from the act of increasing taxes but essentially have the same effect.

===Reduce debt service liability===
Every year, the government must pay debt service payments on their overall public debt. These payments include principal and interest payments. Occasionally, the government has the opportunity to refinance some of their public debt to afford them lower debt service payments. Doing this would allow the government to cut expenditures without cutting government spending.
A balanced budget is a practice that sees a government enforcing that payments, procurement of resources will only be done inline with realised revenues, such that a flat or a zero balance is maintained. Surplus purchases are funded through increases in tax.

===Balanced budget===
According to Alesina, Favor &amp; Giavazzi (2018), &quot;we recognized that shifts in fiscal policy typically come in the form of multiyear plans adopted by governments with the aim of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio over a period of time-typically three to four years. After reconstructing such plans, we divided them into two categories: expenditure-based plans, consisting mostly of spending cuts, and tax-based plans, consisting mostly of tax hikes.&quot; They suggest that paying down the national debt in twenty years is possible through a simplified income tax policy while requiring government officials to enact and follow a balanced budget with additional education on government spending and budgets at all levels of public education. (Alesina, Favor &amp; Giavazzi, 2018).

=== Cancellation of part of the debt: bankruptcy ===
During the Greek government-debt crisis, the cancellation of part of the debt in 2011, which is called a &quot;haircut&quot;, has certainly alleviated the situation of Greek finances, but has put many banks in difficulty. Thus, Cypriot banks lost 5% of their assets in the haircut, which caused a banking crisis in this country.

=== Inflation ===
As the interest rates on government debt securities are generally fixed, rising prices reduce the relative weight of interest payments for a government that sees its revenues artificially inflated by inflation. Nevertheless, the threat of inflation leads creditors to demand higher and higher rates. Inflation thus becomes a decoy that gives governments time but is then paid for in the form of permanently penalizing rates. In the American model, however, inflation remains an option that is often sought. In the European model, the declared choice is price stability in order to ensure the durability of the euro.

==Policy implementations by country==

=== United States ===
In recent years, the United States has faced a growing concern over its government budget balance, with both deficits and surpluses having significant implications for the economy and society as a whole.

==== Overview of the types of policy solutions ====
* Taxation Policy: The U.S. government has implemented various tax policies to address budget deficits, such as increasing taxes on high-income earners and corporations. However, tax policies can have significant political and economic implications, and their effectiveness in reducing deficits is often debated.
* Fiscal Policy: The government can use fiscal policy to increase or decrease government spending and influence the economy. This can include increasing government spending to stimulate economic growth during a recession or decreasing spending during times of economic expansion to reduce inflation .
* Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve can use monetary policy to influence the economy by adjusting interest rates and controlling the money supply. This can include decreasing interest rates to stimulate economic growth or increasing them to reduce inflation. However, monetary policy can have unintended consequences and may not always be effective in reducing deficits.
* Government Efficiency: Improving government efficiency and reducing waste can help reduce deficits. This can include streamlining government programs and services, reducing bureaucracy, and implementing cost-saving measures. However, these policies can be difficult to implement and may face political resistance.
*Budget Reconciliation: The U.S. government can use the budget reconciliation process to pass legislation related to the budget with a simple majority vote. This process can allow for quick and decisive action on budget-related issues, but it can also limit debate and input from the minority party.

It is important to note that these policy solutions can have significant implications for the economy and society, and their effectiveness in reducing deficits may vary depending on various factors, such as economic conditions and political climate. It is also important to consider the potential unintended consequences and equity implications of these policies.

==== Implemented policy solutions and legislation ====

To address issues regarding the government budget balance, policymakers in the United States have implemented various policy solutions and legislation.

One such policy solution is the Budget Control Act of 2011, which established caps on discretionary spending and created a mechanism for automatic spending cuts in the event that those caps were exceeded. This act was intended to reduce the federal deficit by $2.1 trillion over a ten-year period, and has led to reductions in federal spending on defense, domestic programs, and other areas.

Another policy solution is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which implemented significant tax cuts for individuals and corporations. Proponents of this legislation argued that it would stimulate economic growth and create jobs, while opponents raised concerns about its impact on the federal deficit.

There are also ongoing debates regarding entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, which account for a significant portion of federal spending. Some policymakers have proposed changes to these programs, such as raising the retirement age or means-testing benefits, in order to reduce the federal deficit.

The implications of these policy solutions and legislation are complex and multifaceted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 has led to reductions in federal spending that have had a significant impact on various programs and services. While this has helped to reduce the federal deficit, it has also raised concerns about the impact on individuals and communities that rely on these programs. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 has similarly had a range of impacts, including both positive effects on economic growth and concerns about its impact on the federal deficit.

In terms of entitlement programs, changes to these programs could have significant implications for individuals and families that rely on them for support. For example, raising the retirement age for Social Security could have a disproportionate impact on low-income individuals who are more likely to have physically demanding jobs and may not be able to continue working until the new retirement age.

The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established an internal process for Congress to formulate and enforce an overall plan each year for acting on budget legislation. This process includes the development of a congressional budget resolution, which sets spending and revenue targets for the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four years. A congressional budget resolution is a non-binding resolution passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate that sets spending and revenue targets for the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four years. It serves as a blueprint for Congress as it considers budget-related legislation.

Budget reconciliation is an optional procedure used in some years to facilitate the passage of legislation amending tax or spending law. It allows lawmakers to advance spending and tax policies through the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes typically needed to overcome a filibuster. This can make it easier for Congress to pass budget-related legislation.

Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements are statutory budget-control measures that require new tax or mandatory spending legislation to be deficit-neutral over specified periods. This means that any increase in the deficit resulting from new legislation must be offset by other changes in law that reduce the deficit by an equal amount. If PAYGO requirements are not met, automatic spending cuts (known as sequestration) may be triggered to offset the increase in the deficit. However, Congress can waive PAYGO requirements through legislation.

Overall, the implementation of policy solutions and legislation to address issues regarding the government budget balance is a complex and ongoing process that requires careful consideration of a range of factors and potential implications.

<text>Four United States Navy ships have been named USS &quot;Harvard&quot;, after Harvard University:

*, was an auxiliary cruiser purchased for use in the Spanish–American War and in commission during 1898
*USS &quot;Harvard&quot; (ID-1298), a troop transport acquired in April 1918 that was renamed two days after commissioning, then was renamed USS &quot;Harvard&quot; in July 1920 before being sold in October 1920
*, was a leased yacht in commission as a patrol boat from 1917 to 1919
*USS &quot;Harvard&quot; 1945 - At the Kaiser Shipyard in Richmond, California, the 10,800-ton SS &quot;Harvard Victory&quot; was launched as the first of a new series of U.S. Maritime Commission ships named after U.S. educational institutions. The Harvard Corporation later voted to give the ship a library of about 140 volumes selected by the American Merchant Marine Library Association. A simple plaque acknowledged the University&#x27;s gift.</text><links>

<text>John Jay McCloy (March 31, 1895 – March 11, 1989) was an American lawyer, diplomat, banker, and high-ranking bureaucrat. He served as Assistant Secretary of War during World War II under Henry Stimson. In this capacity he dealt with German sabotage and political tensions in the North Africa Campaign. He was both the prime mover of Japanese internment as well as a high-ranking Federal bureaucrat who opposed the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war, he served as the president of the World Bank, U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, a member of the Warren Commission, and a prominent adviser to all presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan.

McCloy was a member of a foreign policy group called &quot;The Wise Men&quot;.
==Early life==
John McCloy was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of John J. McCloy (1862–1901) and Anna (née Snader) McCloy (1866–1959). His father was an insurance man who died when McCloy was five. His mother was a hairdresser in Philadelphia, with many high-society clients. McCloy&#x27;s family was poor; he would later often say he grew up on the &quot;wrong side of the tracks,&quot; and describe himself as being outside the establishment circles in which he would later move. His original name was &quot;John Snader McCloy&quot;. It was later changed to &quot;John Jay McCloy&quot;, probably to sound more aristocratic.

McCloy was educated at the Peddie School in New Jersey, and Amherst College from which he graduated in 1916. He was an above-average student who excelled at tennis and moved smoothly among the sons of the nation&#x27;s elite. McCloy was a brother of Beta Theta Pi fraternity at Amherst.

In 1930, McCloy married Ellen Zinsser, a native of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York and a 1918 graduate of Smith College. She was active in volunteer and civic organizations, such as volunteer nursing programs and served on the board of the New York chapter of the Girls Clubs of America, the Bellevue Hospital nursing school, and the New York chapter of the American Red Cross. They had two children: John J. McCloy II and Ellen Z. McCloy.

==World War I==
McCloy enrolled in Harvard Law School in 1916, and he was an average student. He was profoundly influenced by his experience at the Plattsburg Preparedness camps. When the US entered the war in April 1917, he joined the United States Army in May and was trained at Plattsburgh, New York and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Artillery on August 15, 1917. He was promoted to first lieutenant on December 29. In May 1918 he was assigned as an aide to Brigadier General Guy H. Preston, commander of the 160th Field Artillery Brigade of the 85th Division. He sailed for France for service with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on July 29, 1918. He saw combat service in the last weeks of the war, as commander of an artillery battery during the Meuse–Argonne offensive.

After the armistice of 11 November 1918, he was transferred to General Headquarters of the AEF in Chaumont, Haute-Marne, France, on March 1, 1919. He was then sent to the Advance General Headquarters in Trier, Germany and was promoted to captain on June 29. McCloy returned to the US on July 20 and resigned from the army on August 15, 1919. He then returned to Harvard where he received his LL.B. degree in 1921.

==Wall Street lawyer==
McCloy went to New York to become an associate in the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, which was then one of the nation&#x27;s most prestigious law firms. He moved to Cravath, Henderson, &amp; de Gersdorff in 1924, where he worked with many wealthy clients, such as the St. Paul Railroad. In 1934, McCloy found new evidence allowing him to re-open an action for damages against Germany for the destruction caused by the 1916 Black Tom explosion.

He undertook much work for corporations in Nazi Germany and advised the major German chemical combine I.G. Farben, later the manufacturer of the Zyklon B gas. By the time he left for government service in 1940, McCloy earned about $45,000 a year ($835,000 in 2020 dollars) and had savings of $106,000 ($2,000,000 in 2020 dollars). His involvement in litigation over a World War I sabotage case gave him a strong interest in intelligence issues and in German affairs.

==World War II==

US Secretary of War Henry Stimson hired McCloy as a consultant in September 1940, even though McCloy was a Republican Party supporter and opposed Franklin Roosevelt for the upcoming November 1940 presidential election. Stimson was particularly interested in McCloy due to McCloy&#x27;s extensive experience with German sabotage in the Black Tom case. Stimson knew that the Germans would once again try to sabotage American infrastructure if a war against the United States were to break out. Working for Stimson, McCloy became immersed in war planning.

On April 22, 1941, he was made Assistant Secretary of War but held only civilian responsibilities, especially the purchase of war materials for the Army, Lend Lease, the draft, and issues of intelligence and sabotage. Once the war started, McCloy was a crucial voice in setting US military priorities and played a key role in several notable decisions.

=== Creating a wartime security apparatus ===
An indefatigable committee member, McCloy during the war served on the government task forces that built the Pentagon, created the Office of Strategic Services, which eventually became the Central Intelligence Agency, and he proposed both the United Nations and the war crimes tribunals. He chaired the predecessor to the National Security Council.

===Internment of Japanese-Americans===
In February 1942, his involvement in combating sabotage made McCloy heavily involved in the decision to forcibly remove Japanese-Americans from their homes on the West Coast to inland internment camps. Kai Bird wrote in his biography of McCloy:

More than any individual, McCloy was responsible for the decision, since the (U.S.) President had delegated the matter to him through (U.S. Secretary of War) Stimson.

The generals on the scene had insisted on mass relocation to prevent sabotage, and the Army&#x27;s G-2 (intelligence division) concluded that it was needed. A key document was a Magic-decrypted interception of a Japanese diplomat in Los Angeles, who reported, &quot;We also have connections with our second generations working in airplane plants for intelligence purposes.&quot;

The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), however, disagreed with the Army; in a concurrent report prepared by Commander Kenneth Ringle, ONI had argued against mass internment because most of the Japanese-American citizens suspected of espionage or sabotage were already under surveillance or in FBI custody. McCloy was responsible for supervising the evacuations to the camps, but the camps were run by a civilian agency.

The actions were unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court. By 1945, the judicial consensus had eroded considerably. Three justices dissented in a similar internment challenge brought by Fred Korematsu. The dissenters were led by Justice Frank Murphy&#x27;s reversal of his reluctant concurrence in the earlier case of Gordon Hirabayashi.

Historian Roger Daniels says McCloy was strongly opposed to reopening the judicial verdicts on the constitutionality of the internment. The dissent eventually led to judicial reversal of the criminal convictions of Hirabayashi, Korematsu, and others on the basis of government misconduct including the deliberate suppression of the ONI&#x27;s Ringle report during the Supreme Court&#x27;s deliberations in 1943.

Edward Ennis, a former colleague and Justice Department lawyer tasked with the preparation of the government&#x27;s briefs to the Supreme Court in the Hirabayashi case, would directly accuse McCloy of personal deception in testimony before the Seattle Federal Court&#x27;s 1985 coram nobis review.

That led directly to the final resolution, in 1987, of the internment cases before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which fully exonerated Hirabayashi and other Japanese-American citizens, who fought the wartime curfews and forced relocations resulting from Army orders which the three-judge panel unanimously held were &quot;based upon racism rather than military necessity.&quot;

===Bombing of Auschwitz===
The War Department was petitioned throughout late 1944 to help save Nazi-held prisoners by ordering the bombing of the railroad lines leading to Auschwitz and the gas chambers in the camp. McCloy responded in a letter dated 4 July 1944 to John W. Pehle of the War Refugee Board, &quot;The War Department is of the opinion that the suggested air operation is impracticable. It could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations and would in any case be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not amount to a practical project.&quot; &quot;In fact, long range American bombers stationed in Italy had flown over Auschwitz several times that spring in search of the I.G. petrochemical plant nearby.&quot; In another series of letters, A. Leon Kubowitzki of the World Jewish Congress requested on 9 August 1944 that McCloy consider a message sent to them by Ernest Frischer of the Czechoslovak State Council from the War Refugee Board. Frischer believed that &quot;destruction of gas chambers and crematoria in Oswiecim by bombing would have a certain effect,&quot; and that &quot;bombing of railway communications in this same area would also be of importance and of military interest.&quot; On the 14 August 1944 McCloy responded to Kubowitzki with a letter detailing how the operation would &quot;be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our resources,&quot; adding that &quot;even if practicable, might provoke even more vindictive action by the Germans.&quot; Later, on 8 November 1944, McCloy received another letter from Pehle, now urging McCloy to speak with the War Department and reconsider their refusal to conduct the bombings. Pehle described how he was &quot;hesitant to urge the destruction of these camps by direct, military action,&quot; but felt differently after reading a report from two escapees from Auschwitz who described the conditions of the death camp. McCloy had no direct authority over the Army Air Forces and could not overrule its choice of targets; the Army Air Forces, led by General Hap Arnold was adamantly opposed to any outside civilian group choosing its targets. Roosevelt himself rejected any such proposals.

=== Preserving Rothenburg ob der Tauber ===
In March 1945, Rothenburg ob der Tauber was defended by German soldiers. Since McCloy knew about the historic importance and beauty of Rothenburg, he ordered US Army General Jacob L. Devers not to use artillery in taking Rothenburg. Battalion commander Frank Burke, a future Medal of Honor winner, ordered six soldiers of the 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Division to march into Rothenburg on a three-hour mission and negotiate the surrender of the town.

When stopped by a German soldier, one of the six soldiers, Private Lichey, who spoke fluent German and served as the group&#x27;s translator, held up a white flag and explained, &quot;We are representatives of our division commander. We bring you his offer to spare the city of Rothenburg from shelling and bombing if you agree not to defend it. We have been given three hours to get this message to you. If we haven&#x27;t returned to our lines by 1800 hours, the town will be bombed and shelled to the ground.&quot; The local military commander Major Thömmes gave up the town, ignoring the order of Hitler for all towns to fight to the end and thereby saving it from total destruction by artillery. American troops of the 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Division occupied the town on April 17, 1945, and in November 1948, McCloy was named an honorary citizen (German: &quot;Ehrenbürger&quot;) of Rothenburg.

===Ending war with Japan===
McCloy tried to convince President Truman that an invasion of Japan was not sensible. By mid-1945, the Japanese emperor began looking for ways to unwind the war, going as far as asking the Soviet Union to broker a peace between the United States and Japan. Through Magic intercepts, McCloy had known that the emperor was prepared to surrender if assurances to preserve the Japanese monarchy were given. As such, he advised Truman to offer terms of surrender that offered such a guarantee bundled with the implied threat of using the atomic bomb against Japan. He argued that by doing so, it would enable the United States to claim a moral high ground, in the event that a bombing would be needed to thwart a Japanese mainland invasion. While traveling by boat to the Potsdam Conference, Secretary of State James Byrnes convinced Truman to ignore McCloy&#x27;s advice. Eventually, Truman ordered the atomic bombs to be dropped as soon as they were ready.

=== Rejection of the Morgenthau Plan ===
In 1945, he and Stimson convinced President Truman to reject the Morgenthau Plan and to avoid stripping Germany of its industrial capacity.

=== Ending segregation ===
As chairman of the Army&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policy, he at first opposed the civil rights spokesman who wanted the Army to end segregation. However, he changed his mind and in late 1945, just before leaving the government to return to Wall Street, he proposed ending segregation in the military. On March 17, 1949, McCloy and General Alvan Cullom Gillem, Jr. testified before the President&#x27;s Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services.

== Later career ==

===President of World Bank===
From March 1947 to June 1949, McCloy served as the second president of the World Bank. At the time of his appointment, the World Bank was a new entity, having only been manned by one previous president, Eugene Meyer, who resigned six months into his tenure over disputes with the bank&#x27;s executive directors. McCloy was brought in to resolve the situation and was determined to make the bank an entity that would fund economically efficient projects, not just consumption. Over this tenure, he would develop relationships with Wall Street to overcome their skepticism of these bonds from countries, selling over hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds. Eventually, McCloy would leave the World Bank, as the Marshall Plan would start giving vast sums of economic support in 1948 for Allied countries that would swamp the investment the World Bank could provide.

=== US High Commissioner for Germany ===
On September 2, 1949, McCloy replaced the previous five successive military governors for the US Zone in Germany as the first US High Commissioner for Germany and held the position until August 1, 1952. He oversaw the further creation of the Federal Republic of Germany after May 23, 1949. 

At the strong urging of the West German government, and under massive pressure from the West German public, McCloy approved recommendations (including from the Peck Panel) for commuting of sentences of Nazi criminals including those of the prominent industrialist Alfried Krupp and Einsatzgruppe commander Martin Sandberger. McCloy granted the restitution of Krupp&#x27;s entire property. He also commuted the sentence of Ernst von Weizsäcker at the urging of Winston Churchill. Another commutation handed down was for Edmund Veesenmayer, who played a role in mass deportations.

Nuremberg judge William J. Wilkins wrote,

Imagine my surprise one day in February 1951 to read in the newspaper that John J. McCloy, the high commissioner to Germany, had restored all the Krupp properties that had been ordered confiscated.

McCloy did reject requests for an amnesty. He also refused to commute the death sentences of five men whom he called &quot;the worst of the worst&quot;: Oswald Pohl, Otto Ohlendorf, Paul Blobel, Werner Braune, and Erich Naumann. Two other death sentences from the Dachau trials were upheld by General Thomas T. Handy, that of Georg Schallermair and Hans-Theodor Schmidt. There were mass protests by hundreds of thousands amongst the West German public and government. Many were outraged that full amnesty had not been granted to the condemned, and it reached the point that McCloy&#x27;s family started receiving death threats. Nevertheless, all seven men were executed at Landsberg Prison on June 7, 1951.

McCloy supported the initiative of Inge Aicher-Scholl (the sister of Sophie Scholl), Otl Aicher and Max Bill to found the Ulm School of Design. HfG Ulm is considered to be the most influential design school in the world after the Bauhaus. The founders sought and received support in the USA (via Walter Gropius) and within the American High Command in Germany. McCloy saw the endeavor as &quot;Project No. 1&quot; and supported a college and campus combination along US examples. In 1952 Scholl received from McCloy a check for one million Deutschmarks.

McCloy had served as the first US High Commissioner. His final successor in the post was the fourth US High Commissioner, James B. Conant; the office was terminated on May 5, 1955.

===Return to Wall Street===
Following his service in Germany, he served as chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank from 1953 to 1960 (operating as &quot;Chase National Bank&quot; prior to 1955), and as chairman of the Ford Foundation from 1958 to 1965; he was also a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1946 to 1949, and then again from 1953 to 1958, before he took up the position at Ford.

Following the 1953 death of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, President Eisenhower considered appointing McCloy in his place, but he was viewed as too favourable to big business.

From 1954 to 1970, he was chairman of the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations in New York, to be succeeded by David Rockefeller, who had worked closely with him at the Chase Bank. McCloy had a long association with the Rockefeller family, going back to his early Harvard days when he taught the young Rockefeller brothers how to sail. He was also a member of the Draper Committee, formed in 1958 by Eisenhower.

He later served as adviser to John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and was the primary negotiator on the Presidential Disarmament Committee.

From 1966 to 1968, he was Honorary Chairman of the Paris-based Atlantic Institute.

In late 1967 McCloy was considered by US President Lyndon Johnson for the position of US Ambassador to the United Nations and was approached by Secretary of State Dean Rusk on this matter, however McCloy turned down the offer.
===Warren Commission===
McCloy was selected by President Lyndon Johnson to serve on the Warren Commission in late November 1963. Notably, he was initially skeptical of the lone gunman theory, but a trip to Dallas with CIA veteran Allen Dulles, an old friend also serving on the commission, convinced him of the case against Lee Harvey Oswald. To avoid a minority dissenting report, McCloy brokered the final consensus and the crucial wording of the primary conclusion of the final report. He stated that any possible evidence of a conspiracy was &quot;beyond the reach&quot; of all of America&#x27;s investigatory agencies, principally the FBI and the CIA as well as the Commission itself. In a 1975 interview with Eric Sevareid of CBS, McCloy stated, &quot;I never saw a case that I thought was more completely proven than... the assassination.&quot;

He described writings that propagated assassination conspiracies theories as &quot;just nonsense.&quot;

=== Return to law firm ===
McCloy became a name partner in the Rockefeller-associated prominent New York law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy. He would serve there from 1945 to 1947, and then after serving on the Warren Commission, remained a general partner for 27 years, until he died in 1989. In that capacity, he acted for the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, the leading multinational oil companies, including Exxon, in their initial confrontations with the nationalization movement in Libya as well as negotiations with Saudi Arabia and OPEC. Because of his stature in the legal world and his long association with the Rockefellers and as a presidential adviser, he was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Chairman of the American Establishment&quot;.

== Death ==
McCloy died of pulmonary edema at his home in Cos Cob, a neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut, on March 11, 1989. His wife had died at 87 a few years earlier of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Legacy==
Without regard to partisanship, he served under presidents of both parties. Although a Republican, he was the second-highest-ranking official in the War Department during World War II. Like his fellow &quot;Wise Men,&quot; McCloy often heeded the call to service. Despite having lucrative jobs on Wall Street, he left his positions to serve in government, whether to serve in the War Department or as the High Commissioner in Germany.

McCloy is also remembered for his role in forming the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. He was tasked by Henry Stimson in the early 1940s to sort out the political tensions in the pre-war intelligence community, which was marked by political infighting and jurisdictional disputes among the chiefs of the Army and Navy and the FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover. To sort out the issue, he and William Donovan created a new intelligence program, Office of Strategic Services, that attempted to fuse and streamline those forms of intelligence and is modeled after the British intelligence agencies. The centralization of the war intelligence office became a blueprint for the founding of the Central Intelligence Agency under the National Security Act of 1947.

In recognition of his efforts to the United States, he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction by President Lyndon B. Johnson on December 6, 1963. In the same year, he was awarded the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Society&#x27;s William J. Donovan Award. Also in 1963, McCloy received the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy for his service to the country. Furthermore, McCloy was a recipient of the Association Medal of the New York City Bar Association in recognition of exceptional contributions to the honor and standing of the Bar in the community.

On his 90th birthday on the White House lawn with President Ronald Reagan overlooking, John McCloy was named an honorary citizen of Berlin by German President Richard von Weizsacker and the mayor of Berlin, Eberhard Diepgen. At the event, Ronald Reagan recalled how &quot;John McCloy&#x27;s selfless heart made a difference, an enduring difference, in the lives of millions&quot; and thanked him on behalf of &quot;for all [McCloy&#x27;s] countrymen and the millions of people around the world whose lives [McCloy] helped make safer because of your devotion to duty and to the cause of humanity.&quot; The citation for his honorary citizenship reads &quot;John McCloy is closely connected with the reconstruction and development of this city. His dedication contributed to a great extent to understanding of Berlin in the United States of America and to preservation of peace and freedom.&quot;

<doc id="312621" wikidata="Q7870044" url="?curid=312621" title="USS Harvard (1888)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Harvard of the [[United States Navy]] was an [[auxiliary cruiser]] in the [[Spanish–American War]]. She was launched as &quot;City of New York&quot;, and later commissioned as Plattsburg&quot; (SP-1645) for service in World War I.

Originally a schooner-rigged steamship, she was launched in 1888 as &quot;City of New York&quot; by John Brown and Company, Clydebank, Scotland, for the Inman Line. Sister ship of &quot;City of Paris&quot;, &quot;City of New York&quot; was one of the largest and best liners of her day, and one of the first steamships with twin screws. She was transferred to American registry under the American Line in 1893 as &quot;New York&quot;. These ships brought the United States to the front rank in the Atlantic passenger trade, and &quot;New York&quot; established the record for the Southampton to New York crossing in September 1893.

==Spanish–American War==
At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, &quot;New York&quot; was chartered as an auxiliary cruiser with a civilian crew, commissioning on 26 April 1898 at New York, Captain C. S. Cotton in command and renamed &quot;Harvard&quot;. Assigned as a scout, &quot;Harvard&quot; departed New York on 30 April to cruise West Indian waters in search of the Spanish fleet. After sending back several reports on the location of Spanish units in the Caribbean, &quot;Harvard&quot; was blockaded by a larger force at Saint-Pierre, Martinique from 11 to 17 May, after which she proceeded to Santiago de Cuba and St. Nicholas Mole, Haiti, with dispatches from Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. Interrupting her scouting duties, &quot;Harvard&quot; returned to Newport News, Virginia, 7–26 June during which time her crew was officially taken into the Naval Service.

&quot;Harvard&quot; returned to the Caribbean with troops and supplies, arriving at Altares, Cuba, about 1 July. The morning of 3 July, she received the electrifying news that the Spanish fleet had sortied. After Rear Admiral William T. Sampson&#x27;s smashing victory off Santiago, she rescued survivors. Despite the high surf and ammunition explosions from the stricken Spanish ships, &quot;Harvard&quot; succeeded in recovering over 600 officers and men.

On 4 July 1898, the 9th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry were guarding the prisoners of war inside &quot;Harvard&quot;. A guard ordered a prisoner, who was attempting to cross the line, to return. The prisoner did not understand English and the guard fired a shot causing other prisoners to stand up. Fearing the prisoners were about to attack, the guards opened fire killing six prisoners and wounding thirteen more. After the investigation, it was concluded that it was a mistake. The tragedy was known as &quot;Harvard Incident&quot;.

No longer needed as a scout in the Caribbean, &quot;Harvard&quot; was sent back to the United States 10 July 1898. She was temporarily turned over to the War Department, and returned to Santiago de Cuba to transport troops back to the United States. &quot;Harvard&quot; arrived at New York on 27 August and decommissioned 2 September 1898 at New York Navy Yard.

==World War I and demise==
Reverting to her old name, &quot;New York&quot;, the ship resumed transatlantic service with the American Line until World War I. During this period she underwent extensive conversion in 1903, when one of her three funnels was removed. When United States joined World War I, again needed in support of American forces abroad, &quot;New York&quot; was chartered by the Navy 9 May 1918 for use as a troop transport. She commissioned as &quot;Plattsburg&quot; on 24 May 1918 and commanded by Claude C. Bloch.

&quot;Plattsburg&quot; made four voyages from New York to Liverpool transporting the American Expeditionary Force to Europe, and after the end of the war made a total of seven voyages, bringing home over 24,000 veterans. She returned to New York after her final crossing on 29 August 1919, and was returned to her owners on 6 October 1919.

As &quot;New York&quot;, the ship once again plied the Atlantic with passengers, but she was no longer a first-class liner and was withdrawn from service in 1920. Sold to the Polish Navigation Company, she made two more voyages, but the company was soon forced to close down and the ship was scrapped in 1923.

<text>The 1999 Seattle WTO protests, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Seattle, were a series of anti-globalization protests surrounding the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999, where members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) convened at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle, Washington on November 30, 1999. The Conference was to be the launch of a new millennial round of trade negotiations.

The negotiations were quickly overshadowed by massive street protests outside the hotels and the Washington State Convention and Trade Center. The protests were nicknamed &quot;N30&quot;, akin to J18 and similar mobilizations. The large scale of the demonstrations, estimated at no fewer than 40,000 protesters, dwarfed any previous demonstration in the United States against a world meeting of any of the organizations generally associated with economic globalization, such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank.

==Organizations and planning==
Planning for the actions began months in advance and included local, national, and international organizations. Among the most notable participants were national and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as Global Exchange (especially those concerned with labor issues, the environment, and consumer protection), labor unions (including the AFL–CIO), student groups, religion-based groups (Jubilee 2000), and anarchists (some of whom formed a black bloc). The protests also drew support from some political conservatives, such as American presidential candidate and commentator Pat Buchanan.

The coalition was loose, with some opponent groups focused on opposition to WTO policies (especially those related to free trade), with others motivated by prolabor, anticapitalist, or environmental agendas. Many of the NGOs represented at the protests came with credentials to participate in the official meetings, while also planning various educational and press events. The AFL–CIO, with cooperation from its member unions, organized a large permitted rally and march from Seattle Center to downtown.

However, others were more interested in taking direct action, including both civil disobedience and acts of vandalism and property destruction to disrupt the meeting. Several groups were loosely organized together under the Direct Action Network (DAN), with a plan to disrupt the meetings by blocking streets and intersections downtown to prevent delegates from reaching the convention center, where the meeting was to be held. The black bloc was not affiliated with DAN, but was responding to the original call for autonomous resistance actions on November 30 issued by People&#x27;s Global Action.

Of the different coalitions that aligned in protest were the &quot;teamsters and turtles&quot; – a blue–green alliance consisting of the teamsters (trade unions) and environmentalists.

===Corporations targeted===
Certain activists, including locals and an additional group of anarchists from Eugene, Oregon (where they had gathered that summer for a music festival), advocated more confrontational tactics, and conducted vandalism of corporate properties in downtown Seattle. In a subsequent communique, they listed the particular corporations targeted, which they considered to have committed corporate crime.

===Lead-up months===
On July 12, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that the latest United Nations Human Development report advocated &quot;principles of performance for multinationals on labour standards, fair trade and environmental protection ... needed to counter the negative effects of globalisation on the poorest nations&quot;. The report itself argued, &quot;An essential aspect of global governance is responsibility to people—to equity, to justice, to enlarging the choices of all&quot;.

On July 16, Helene Cooper of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; warned of an impending &quot;massive mobilization against globalization&quot; being planned for the end-of-year Seattle WTO conference. Next day, the London &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper savaged the WTO and appeared to side with the organizers of the rapidly developing storm of protest:

The way it has used [its] powers is leading to a growing suspicion that its initials should really stand for World Take Over. In a series of rulings it has struck down measures to help the world&#x27;s poor, protect the environment, and safeguard health in the interests of private—usually American—companies.

&quot;The WTO seems to be on a crusade to increase private profit at the expense of all other considerations, including the well-being and quality of life of the mass of the world&#x27;s people,&quot; says Ronnie Hall, trade campaigner at Friends of the Earth International. &quot;It seems to have a relentless drive to extend its power.&quot;

On November 16, two weeks before the conference, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 13141—Environmental Review of Trade Agreements, which committed the United States to a policy of &quot;assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements&quot; and stated, &quot;Trade agreements should contribute to the broader goal of sustainable development.&quot;

Activists staged a spoof of Seattle daily newspaper the &quot;Post-Intelligencer&quot; on Wednesday November 24, inserting thousands of hoax editions of a four-page front-page wrap-around into piles of newspapers awaiting distribution to hundreds of street boxes and retail outlets. The spoof front-page stories were &quot;Boeing to move overseas&quot; (to Indonesia) and &quot;Clinton pledges help for poorest nations&quot;. The byline on the Boeing story attributed it to Joe Hill (a union organizer who had been executed by firing squad in Utah in 1915). On the same day, the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development reported:

developing countries have remained steadfast in their demand that developed countries honour Uruguay Round commitments before moving forward full force with new trade negotiations. Specifically, developing countries are concerned over developed countries&#x27; compliance with agreements on market access for textiles, their use of antidumping measures against developing countries&#x27; exports, and over-implementation of the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).

==N30==

On the morning of Tuesday, November 30, 1999, the DAN&#x27;s plan was put into effect. Several hundred activists arrived in the deserted streets near the convention center and began to take control of key intersections. Over the next few hours, a number of marchers began to converge on the area from different directions. These included a student march from the north, a march of citizens of the developing world who marched in from the south and, beginning around 09:00, militant anarchists (in a formation known as a black bloc) marching down Pike Street from 6th Avenue, blockading the streets with newspaper boxes and smashing windows. Some demonstrators held rallies, others held teach-ins and at least one group staged an early-morning street party. Meanwhile, a number of protesters still controlled the intersections using lockdown formations.
That morning, the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and Seattle Police Department fired pepper spray, tear gas canisters, and stun grenades at protesters at several intersections in an attempt to reopen the blocked streets and allow as many WTO delegates as possible through the blockade. At 6th Avenue and Union Street, the crowd threw objects back at the police.

By late morning, the black bloc had swelled to 200 people and smashed dozens of shops and police cars. This seems to have set off a chain reaction of sorts, with previously nonviolent protesters throwing bottles at police and joining in the vandalism shortly before noon.

The police were eventually overwhelmed by the mass of protesters downtown, including many who had chained themselves together and were blocking intersections. Meanwhile, the late-morning labor-organized rally and march drew tens of thousands; though the intended march route had them turning back before they reached the convention center, some ignored the marshals and joined what had become a chaotic scene downtown.

At noon, the opening ceremony at the convention center was officially canceled. It took police much of the afternoon and evening to clear the streets. Seattle mayor Paul Schell declared a state of emergency, imposed a curfew, and a 50-block &quot;no-protest zone.&quot;

=== December 1 ===

Overnight, the governor of Washington, Gary Locke, called in two battalions of Army National Guardsmen, other law enforcement agencies sent support, and before daylight on Wednesday, troops and officers lined the perimeter of the no-protest zone. Police surrounded and arrested several groups of would-be protesters (and more than one bystander). Beginning at 21:00, a major clash took place on Broadway in the vicinity of Denny Way, involving rocks, bottles, and police concussion grenades. It did not involve a black bloc, but appears to have included local residents, although it is known that many local residents were treated as protesters, even being teargassed, despite having no part in the protests. Police called in from other cities mistook the typically crowded streets of Capitol Hill as groups of protesters. More than 500 people were jailed on Wednesday. Throughout the day, police used tear gas to disperse crowds downtown, although a permitted demonstration organized by the Steelworkers Union was held along the waterfront.

=== December 2–3 ===

Protests continued the following days. Thousands demonstrated outside the Seattle Police Department protesting their tactics and arrests of peaceful protestors. President Clinton arrived and attended the conference. On December 3 the conference ended as delegations were unable to reach agreements, partly in response to the protests.
Confrontations with the police continued, albeit at a lower intensity. The primary goal of disrupting the trade talks achieved, some sought the horizons of possibility; it was determined quickly that the necessary ambition to achieve the broader goals of various anarchist factions was not sufficient.

== Media response ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; published false reports that protesters threw Molotov cocktails at police. Two days later, the &quot;Times&quot; printed a correction saying that the protest was mostly peaceful and no protesters were accused of throwing objects at delegates or the police, but the original error persisted in later accounts in the mainstream media.

The Seattle City Council dispelled the reports with its own investigation findings:
The level of panic among police is evident from radio communication and from their inflated crowd estimates, which exceed the numbers shown on news videotapes. ARC investigators found the rumors of &quot;Molotov cocktails&quot; and sale of flammables from a supermarket had no basis in fact. But, rumors were important in contributing to the police sense of being besieged and in considerable danger.

An article in the magazine &quot;The Nation&quot; disputed that Molotov cocktails have ever been thrown at an antiglobalization protest within the United States. 

Though media coverage of the protests condemned the violence of some of the protesters, the nature of this violence has been justified by some people. Specifically, the violence employed was not person-to-person violence, but &quot;acts directed toward property, not people&quot;. 

Though many still denounced the violent tactics used by protesters, this violence clearly resulted in increased media coverage of the event. The WTO meeting had an increase in evening news airtime from 10 minutes and 40 seconds on the first day of the meeting to 17 minutes on the first day of violence. In addition, WTO coverage was the lead or second story on CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC after violence was reported. Two days after the start of violence, the meeting remained the top story on three of the four networks. 

Though these numbers alone are telling, the media coverage of subsequent demonstrations that did not include violence by protesters shows even more the effect of violence on coverage. For example, the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (WB/IMF) meetings in the spring showed a &quot;coverage pattern that was almost the reverse of that in Seattle&quot; and that &quot;suggests the crucial role of violence in garnering time on the public screen.&quot; In an even more striking example of the effects of violence on media coverage, the 2001 WTO meeting in Doha, Qatar, included no reports of violence. As a result, &quot;there was absolutely no TV evening news coverage by the four major networks.&quot;

This coverage did not center exclusively on the violence. Instead, details of the protesters&#x27; message and antiglobalization campaign were included along with the discussions of symbolic violence taking place. It is said that the violence served as a dense surface that opened viewers&#x27; and readers&#x27; minds to a whole new way of thinking about globalization and corporations&#x27; operations. That is, not only was this violence contained within the familiar setting of television, and not only did it meet the criteria of being dramatic and emotional enough to warrant air time, but it also shattered preconceived notions of globalization and the practices of corporations that drive so much of America&#x27;s economy.

==Aftermath==
To many in North American anarchist and radical circles, the Seattle WTO riots, protests, and demonstrations were viewed as a success. Prior to the &quot;Battle of Seattle&quot;, almost no mention was made of &quot;antiglobalization&quot; in the US media, while the protests were seen as having forced the media to report on &#x27;why&#x27; anybody would oppose the WTO.

Previous mass demonstrations had taken place in Australia in December 1997, in which newly formed grass-roots organizations blockaded Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, and Darwin city centers.

Controversy over the city&#x27;s response to the protests resulted in the resignation of the police chief of Seattle, Norm Stamper, and arguably played a role in Schell&#x27;s loss to Greg Nickels in the 2001 mayoral primary election. The massive size of the protest added $3 million to the city&#x27;s estimated meeting budget of $6 million, partly due to city cleanup and police overtime bills. In addition, the damage to commercial businesses from vandalism and lost sales has been estimated at $20 million.

On January 16, 2004, the city of Seattle settled with 157 individuals arrested outside of the no-protest zone during the WTO events, agreeing to pay them a total of $250,000. On January 30, 2007, a federal jury found that the city had violated protesters&#x27; Fourth Amendment constitutional rights by arresting them without probable cause or evidence.

Inspired by these protests, a similar one occurred in Prague in September 2000. Around 12,000 activists gathered to protest during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank summit on September 27, 2000.

<doc id="312623" wikidata="Q1975638" url="?curid=312623" title="Schindler's Ark">
<text>Schindler&#x27;s Ark is a historical fiction published in 1982 by the Australian novelist Thomas Keneally. It is based on the fictionalized story of the historical figure, Oskar Schindler. The United States edition of the book was titled Schindler&#x27;s List; it was later reissued in Commonwealth countries under that name as well. The novel won the Booker Prize, a literary award conferred each year for the best single work of sustained fiction written in the English language, and was awarded the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize for Fiction in 1983.

The book tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who becomes an unlikely hero by saving the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust. It follows actual people and events, with fictional dialogue and scenes added by the author where exact details are unknown. Keneally wrote a number of well-received novels before and after &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;; however, in the wake of its highly successful 1993 film adaptation directed by director Steven Spielberg, it has since gone on to become his most well-known and celebrated work.

In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Background==
Poldek Pfefferberg, a Holocaust survivor and Schindlerjude, inspired Keneally to write &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;. After the war, Pfefferberg had tried on a number of occasions to interest the screenwriters and filmmakers he met through his business in making a film based on the story of Schindler and his efforts to save Polish Jews from the Nazis, as well as arranging several interviews with Schindler for American television.

Keneally&#x27;s meetings with Pfefferberg and his research and interviews of Schindler&#x27;s acquaintances are detailed in his 2007 book &quot;Searching for Schindler: A Memoir&quot;. In October 1980, Keneally went into Pfefferberg&#x27;s shop in Beverly Hills to ask about the price of briefcases. Learning that Keneally was a novelist, Pfefferberg showed him his extensive files on Schindler, kept in two cabinets in his back room. After 50 minutes of entreaties, Pfefferberg was able to convince Keneally to write the book. Pfefferberg became an advisor, accompanying Keneally to Poland, where they visited Kraków and other sites associated with the Schindler story. Keneally dedicated &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; to Pfefferberg: &quot;who by zeal and persistence caused this book to be written.&quot;

After the publication of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; in 1982, Pfefferberg worked to persuade Steven Spielberg to film Keneally&#x27;s book, using his acquaintance with Spielberg&#x27;s mother to gain access.

A carbon copy of Schindler&#x27;s original 13-page list, initially thought to be lost, was discovered in 2009 in a library in Sydney, Australia.

==Plot summary==
This novel tells the story of Oskar Schindler, self-made entrepreneur and &quot;&quot; who finds himself saving Polish Jews from the Nazi death machine. Based on numerous eyewitness accounts, Keneally&#x27;s story takes place within Hitler&#x27;s attempts to make Europe &quot;judenfrei&quot; (free of Jews). Schindler is presented as a flawed hero – a drinker, a womaniser and, at first, a profiteer. After the war, he was commemorated as Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, but was never seen as a conventionally virtuous character. The story is not only Schindler&#x27;s, it is the story of Kraków&#x27;s Ghetto and the forced labour camp outside town, Płaszów, and of Amon Göth, Płaszów&#x27;s commandant.

His wife Emilie Schindler later remarked in a German TV interview that Schindler did nothing remarkable before the war and nothing after it. &quot;He was fortunate therefore that in the short fierce era between 1939 and 1945 he had met people who had summoned forth his deeper talents.&quot; After the war, his business ventures failed and he separated from his wife. He ended up living a sparse life in a small flat in Frankfurt. Eventually he arranged to live part of the year in Israel, supported by his Jewish friends, and part of the year in Frankfurt, where he was often hissed at in the streets as a traitor to his &quot;race&quot;. After 29 unexceptional postwar years, he died in 1974. He was buried in Jerusalem, as he wished, with the help of his old friend Pfefferberg.

<doc id="312625" wikidata="Q155361" url="?curid=312625" title="Rouran Khaganate">
<text>The Rouran Khaganate (), also known as Ruanruan or Juan-juan () (or variously &quot;Jou-jan&quot;, &quot;Ruruan&quot;, &quot;Ju-juan&quot;, &quot;Ruru&quot;, &quot;Ruirui&quot;, &quot;Rouru&quot;, &quot;Rouruan&quot; or &quot;Tantan&quot;), was a tribal confederation and later state founded by a people of Proto-Mongolic Donghu origin. The Rouran supreme rulers used the title of , a popular title borrowed from the Xianbei. The Rouran Khaganate lasted from the late 4th century until the middle 6th century with territories that covered all of modern day Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, as well as parts of Manchuria in Northeast China, Eastern Siberia, Xinjiang, and Kazakhstan. The Hephthalites were vassals of the Rouran Khaganate until the beginning of the 5th century, with the royal house of Rourans intermarrying with the royal houses of the Hephthalites. The Rouran Khaganate ended when they were defeated by a Göktürk rebellion at the peak of their power, which subsequently led to the rise of the Turks in world history. 

Their Khaganate overthrown, some Rouran remnants possibly became Tatars while others possibly migrated west and became the Pannonian Avars (known by such names as &quot;Varchonites&quot; or &quot;Pseudo Avars&quot;), who settled in Pannonia (centred on modern Hungary) during the 6th century. These Avars were pursued into the Byzantine Empire by the Göktürks, who referred to the Avars as a slave or vassal people, and requested that the Byzantines expel them. While this Rouran-Avars link remains a controversial theory, a recent DNA study has confirmed the genetic origins of the Avar elite as originating from the Mongolian plains. Other theories instead link the origins of the Pannonian Avars to peoples such as the Uar.

An imperial confederation, the Rouran Khaganate was based on the &quot;distant exploitation of agrarian societies&quot;, although according to Nikolay Kradin the Rouran had a feudal system, or &quot;nomadic feudalism&quot;. The Rouran controlled trade routes, and raided and subjugated oases and outposts such as Gaochang. They are said to have shown the signs of &quot;both an early state and a chiefdom&quot;. The Rouran have been credited as &quot;a band of steppe robbers&quot;, because they adopted a strategy of raids and extortion of Northern China. The Khaganate was an aggressive militarized society, a &quot;military-hierarchical polity established to solve the exclusively foreign-policy problems of requisitioning surplus products from neighbouring nations and states.&quot;

==Name==
===Nomenclature===
&quot;Róurán&quot; 柔然 is a Classical Chinese transcription of the endonym of the confederacy; meanwhile, 蠕蠕 &quot;Ruǎnruǎn&quot; ~ &quot;Rúrú&quot; (Weishu), which connoted something akin to &quot;wriggling worm&quot; , was used derogatorily in Tuoba-Xianbei sources. Other transcriptions are 蝚蠕 &quot;Róurú&quot; ~ &quot;Róuruǎn&quot; (Jinshu); 茹茹 &quot;Rúrú&quot; (Beiqishu, Zhoushu, Suishu); 芮芮 &quot;Ruìruì&quot; (Nanqishu, Liangshu, Songshu), 大檀 &quot;Dàtán&quot; and 檀檀 &quot;Tántán&quot; (Songshu). However, Baumer (2018), while acknowledging that &quot;Ruanruan&quot; (蠕蠕) was a &quot;derogatory pun&quot; on &quot;Rouran&quot; (柔然), proposes that the ethnonym &quot;Rouran&quot; (柔然) is indeed derived from the name &quot;Ruru&quot; (茹茹) or &quot;Ruirui&quot; (芮芮) of a &quot;tribal father&quot;.

Mongolian Sinologist Sükhbaatar suggests &quot;Nirun&quot; Нирун as the modern Mongolian term for the &quot;Rouran&quot;, as Нирун resembles reconstructed Chinese forms beginning with *&quot;ń&quot;- or *&quot;ŋ&quot;-. Rashid-al-Din Hamadani recorded &quot;Niru&#x27;un&quot; and &quot;Dürlükin&quot; as two divisions of the Mongols.

===Etymology===
Klyastorny reconstructed the ethnonym behind the Chinese transcription 柔然 &quot;Róurán&quot; (LHC: *&quot;ńu-ńan&quot;; EMC: *&quot;ɲuw-ɲian&quot; &gt; LMC: *&quot;riw-rian&quot;) as *&quot;nönör&quot; and compares it to Mongolic нөкүр &quot;nökür&quot; &quot;friend, comrade, companion&quot; (Khalkha нөхөр &quot;nöhör&quot;). According to Klyashtorny, *&quot;nönör&quot; denotes &quot;stepnaja vol&#x27;nica&quot; &quot;a free, roving band in the steppe, the &#x27;companions&#x27; of the early Rouran leaders&quot;. In early Mongol society, a &quot;nökür&quot; was someone who had left his clan or tribe to pledge loyalty to and serve a charismatic warlord; if this derivation were correct, &quot;Róurán&quot; 柔然 was originally not an ethnonym, but a social term referring to the dynastic founder&#x27;s origins or the core circle of companions who helped him build his state.

However, Golden identifies philological problems: the ethnonym should have been *&quot;nöŋör&quot; to be cognate to &quot;nökür&quot;, &amp; possible assimilation of -/k/- to -/n/- in Chinese transcription needs further linguistic proofs. Even if 柔然 somehow transmitted &quot;nökür&quot;, it more likely denoted the Rouran&#x27;s status as the subjects of the Tuoba. Before being used as an ethnonym, Rouran had originally been the byname of chief Cheluhui (車鹿會), possibly denoting his status &quot;as a Wei servitor&quot;.

==History==
===Origin===
Primary Chinese-language sources Songshu and Liangshu connected Rouran to the earlier Xiongnu (of unknown ethnolinguistic affiliation) while Weishu traced the Rouran&#x27;s origins back to the Donghu, generally agreed to be Proto-Mongols. Xu proposed that &quot;the main body of the Rouran were of Xiongnu origin&quot; and Rourans&#x27; descendants, namely Da Shiwei (aka Tatars), contained Turkic elements, besides Mongolic Xianbei. Even so, the Xiongnu&#x27;s language is still unknown and Chinese historians routinely ascribed Xiongnu origins to various nomadic groups, yet such ascriptions do not necessarily indicate the subjects&#x27; exact origins: for examples, Xiongnu ancestry was ascribed to Turkic-speaking Göktürks and Tiele as well as Para-Mongolic-speaking Kumo Xi and Khitans.

Kwok Kin Poon additionally proposes that the Rouran were descended specifically from Donghu&#x27;s Xianbei lineage, i.e. from Xianbei who remained in the eastern Eurasian Steppe after most Xianbei had migrated south and settled in Northern China. Genetic testing on Rourans&#x27; remains suggested Donghu-Xianbei paternal genetic contribution to Rourans.

===Khaganate===
The founder of the Rouran Khaganate, Yujiulu Shelun, was descended from Mugulü, a slave of the Xianbei. Rouran women were commonly taken as wives or concubines by the Xianbei.

After the Xianbei migrated south and settled in Chinese lands during the late 3rd century AD, the Rouran made a name for themselves as fierce warriors. However they remained politically fragmented until 402 AD when Shelun gained support of all the Rouran chieftains and united the Rouran under one banner. Immediately after uniting, the Rouran entered a perpetual conflict with Northern Wei, beginning with a Wei offensive that drove the Rouran from the Ordos region. The Rouran expanded westward and defeated the neighboring Tiele people and expanded their territory over the Silk Roads, even vassalizing the Hephthalites which remained so until the beginning of the 5th century.

The Hepthalites migrated southeast due to pressure from the Rouran and displaced the Yuezhi in Bactria, forcing them to migrate further south. Despite the conflict between the Hephthalites and Rouran, the Hephthalites borrowed much from their eastern overlords, in particular the title of &quot;Khan&quot; which was first used by the Rouran as a title for their rulers.

The Rouran were considered vassals () by Tuoba Wei. By 506 they were considered a vassal state (). Following the growth of Rouran and the turning of Wei into a classical Chinese state, they were considered partners of equal rights by Wei (&quot;lindi gangli&quot;).

In 424, the Rouran invaded Northern Wei but were repulsed.

In 429, Northern Wei launched a major offensive against the Rouran and killed a large number of people.

In 434, the Rouran entered a marriage alliance with Northern Wei. In 443, Northern Wei attacked the Rouran. In 449, the Rouran were defeated in battle by Northern Wei. In 456, Northern Wei attacked the Rouran. In 458, Northern Wei attacked the Rouran.

In 460, the Rouran subjugated the Ashina tribe residing around modern Turpan and resettled them in the Altai Mountains. The Rouran also ousted the previous dynasty of Gaochang (the remnants of the Northern Liang) and installed Kan Bozhou as its king.

In 492, Emperor Tuoba Hong sent 70 thousand horsemen against Rouran. The outcome of the expedition does not appear in Chinese sources and is thus unknown. According to Nikolay Kradin, since Chinese sources are silent about the outcome of the expedition, it is probable that it was unsuccessful. Kradin notes that, possibly strained after the battle with Wei, the Rourans were not able to prevent the Uighur chief Abuzhiluo from heading &quot;a 100 thousand tents&quot; west, in a series of events that led to the overthrowing and killing of Doulun Khan. Two armies were sent in pursuit of the rebels, one led by Doulun, the other by Nagai, his uncle. The Rouran emerged victorious. In the war against the Uighurs, Doulan fought well, but his uncle Nagai won all the battles against the Uighurs. Thus, the soldiers thought that Heaven didn&#x27;t favor Doulan anymore, and that he should be deposed in favor of Nagai. The latter declined. Nonetheless, the subjects killed Doulan and murdered his next of kin, installing Nagai on the throne. In 518, Nagai married the sorceress Diwan, conferring her the title of &quot;khagatun&quot; for her outstanding service.

Between 525 and 527, Rouran was employed by Northern Wei in the suppression of rebellions in their territory, with the Rourans then plundering the local population.

The Rouran Khaganate arranged for one of their princesses, Khagan Yujiulü Anagui&#x27;s daughter Princess Ruru, to be married to the Han Chinese ruler Gao Huan of the Eastern Wei.

===&quot;Heqin&quot;===
The Rourans were involved many times in royal intermarriage (also known as &quot;Heqin&quot; in China), with the Northern Yan as well as the Northern Wei dynasty and its successors Eastern and Western Wei, which were fighting each other, and each seeking the support of Rouran to defeat the other. Both parties, in turn, took the initiative of proposing such marriages to forge important alliances or solidify relations.

In the 1970s, the Tomb of Princess Linhe was unearthed in Ci County, Hebei. It contained artistically invaluable murals, a mostly pillaged but still consistent treasure, Byzantine coins and about a thousand vessels and clay figurines. Among the latter was the figurine of a shaman, standing in a dancing posture and holding a saw-like instrument. This figurine is thought to reflect the young princess&#x27; Rouran/nomadic roots.

On one occasion, in 540, the Rourans allegedly attacked Western Wei reportedly with a million warriors because a Rouran princess reported being dissatisfied with being second to Emperor Wendi&#x27;s principal wife.

The first &quot;khagan&quot; Shelun is said to have concluded a &quot;treaty of peace based on kinship&quot; () with the rulers of Jin. The royal house of Rouran is also said to have intermarried with the royal house of the Haital (Hephthalites) in the 6th century.

===Society===
Since the time of Shelun Khan, the khans were bestowed with additional titles at their enthronement. After 464, starting with Yucheng Khan they started to use epoch names, in imitation of the Chinese. The Rouran dignitaries of the ruling elite also adopted nicknames referring to their deeds, similar to the titles the Chinese bestowed posthumously. Kradin notes that this practice is analogous with that of later Mongolian chiefs. There appears to have been a wide circle composing the nomadic aristocracy, including elders, chieftains, military commanders. The grandees could be high or low ranking. According to Kradin, the khagan could confer titles in reward of services rendered and outstanding deeds. He cites as an example of this an event occurred in 518, when Nagai entitled the sorceress Diwai &quot;khagatun&quot;, taking her as his wife, and gave a compensation, a post and a title to Fushengmou, her then former husband. The Rouran titles included , (cf. Mongolian batur, baghatur), (cf. Mongolian ), , and , , , (cf. Turkic irkin), (cf. Turkic eltäbär).

It is known that in 521 Khagan Anagui was given two bondmaids as a gift from the Chinese, while Khagan Shelun is said to have once declared that the soldiers who fought outstandingly would receive captives. However, &quot;there is nothing in the sources about the enslavement of prisoners of war&quot;. There is, however, evidence that the Rouran resettled people in the steppe.

Initially the Rouran chiefs, having no letters to make records, &quot;counted approximately the number of warriors by using sheep&#x27;s droppings&quot;. Later, they learned to make records using notches on wood. A later source claims that the Rouran later adopted the Chinese written language for diplomatic relations, and under Anagui, started to write internal records. According to the same source, there were also many literate people among the Rouran by that time. Kradin notes that the level of literacy &quot;based on the knowledge of written Chinese&quot; was rather high, and that it didn&#x27;t affect only the elite and the immigrants, but also some cattle-breeders were able to use Chinese ideograms. In the &quot;Book of Song&quot; there is the story of an educated Rouran &quot;whose knowledge shamed a wise Chinese functionary&quot;. There is no record of monuments erected by the Rouran, though there is evidence of the latter requesting doctors, weavers and other artisans to be sent from China.

Imitating the Chinese, Anagui Khan introduced the use of officials at court, &quot;surrounded himself with advisers trained in the tradition of Chinese bibliophily&quot;, and adopted a staff of bodyguards, or chamberlains. Hyun Jin Kim notes a similar use of bodyguards performing the same function in the contemporary Hunnic Empire to the west. Kim also compared the &quot;rudimentary bureaucratic organisation&quot; of the Rourans to that of the Huns, as well as their &quot;hierarchical, stratified structure of government&quot;.
Anagui&#x27;s chief advisor was the Chinese Shunyu Tan, whose role is comparable to that of Yelü Chucai with the Mongols and Zhonghang Yue with the Xiongnu (or Huns).

Recent archeological finds in Mongolia (the Urd Ulaan Uneet Burial and Khukh Nuur Burial) suggest that the Mongolic Rouran tribes had sophisticated, wooden frame saddles and iron stirrups by at least the fourth and fifth centuries AD. Radiocarbon dating of related items date them to between the 3rd century to 6th century AD. The wooden frame saddle and the iron stirrups in found at these burials in Mongolia are one of the earliest examples found in Central and East Asia.

===Capital===
The capital of the Rouran likely changed over time. The headquarters of the Rouran Khan (&quot;ting&quot;) was said to be initially northwest of Gansu.
Later the capital of the Rouran became the legendary town of Mumocheng, said to have been &quot;encircled with two walls constructed by Liang Shu&quot;. The existence of this city would be proof of early urbanization among the Rouran. However, no trace of it has been found so far; its location is unknown, and debated among historians.

===Decline===
In 461, Lü Pi, Duke of Hedong, a Northern Wei general and Grand chancellor of royal Rouran descent, died in Northern Wei. The Rouran and the Hephthalites had a falling out and problems within their confederation were encouraged by Chinese agents.

In 508, the Tiele defeated the Rouran in battle. In 516, the Rouran defeated the Tiele. In 551, Bumin of the Ashina Göktürks quelled a Tiele revolt for the Rouran and asked for a Rouran princess for his service. The Rouran refused and in response Bumin declared independence.

Bumin entered a marriage alliance with Western Wei, a successor state of Northern Wei, and attacked the Rouran in 552. The Rouran, now at the peak of their might, were defeated by the Turks. After a defeat at Huaihuang (in present-day Zhangjiakou, Hebei) the last great khan Anagui, realizing he had been defeated, took his own life. Bumin declared himself Illig Khagan of the Turkic Khaganate after conquering Otuken; Bumin died soon after and his son Issik Qaghan succeeded him. Issik continued attacking the Rouran, their khaganate now fallen into decay, but died a year later in 553.

In 555, Turks invaded and occupied the Rouran and Yujiulü Dengshuzi led 3000 soldiers in retreat to Western Wei. He was later delivered to Turks by Emperor Gong with his soldiers under pressure from Muqan Qaghan. In the same year, Muqan annihilated the Rouran. All the Rouran handed over to the Turks, reportedly with the exception of children less than sixteen, were brutally killed.

On 29 November 586 Yujiulü Furen (郁久闾伏仁), an official of Sui and a descendant of the ruling clan, died in Hebei, leaving an epitaph reporting his royal descent from the Yujiulü clan.

==Possible descendants==
===Tatars===
According to Xu (2005), some Rouran remnants fled to the northwest of the Greater Khingan mountain range, and renamed themselves 大檀 &quot;Dàtán&quot; (MC: *&quot;daH-dan&quot;) or 檀檀 &quot;Tántán&quot; (MC: *&quot;dan-dan&quot;) after Tantan, personal name of a historical Rouran Khagan. Tantan were gradually incorporated into the Shiwei tribal complex and later emerged as Great-&quot;Da Shiwei&quot; (大室韋) in . Klyashtorny, apud Golden (2013), reconstructed 大檀 / 檀檀 as *&quot;tatar&quot; / &quot;dadar&quot;, &quot;the people who, [Klyashtorny] concludes, assisted Datan in the 420s in his internal struggles and who later are noted as the &quot;Otuz Tatar&quot; (&quot;Thirty Tatars&quot;) who were among the mourners at the funeral of Bumın Qağan (see the inscriptions of Kül Tegin, E4 and Bilge Qağan, E5)&quot;.

===Avars===
Some scholars claim that the Rouran then fled west across the steppes and became the Avars, though many other scholars contest this claim. New genetic data seem to answer that question, says Walter Pohl, a historian at the University of Vienna. &quot;We have a very clear indication that they must have come from the core of the Rouran Empire. They were the neighbors of the Chinese.&quot; &quot;Genetically speaking, the elite Avars have a very, very eastern profile,&quot; says Choongwon Jeong, a co-author and a geneticist at Seoul National University.
That genetic data backs up two historical accounts of the Avar&#x27;s origins. One sixth century Chinese source describes an enigmatic steppe people called the Rouran, one of many horse-riding nomadic groups that swept out of the Mongolian steppes to attack their northern borders. The Rouran&#x27;s grassland empire was reportedly defeated by rival nomads in 552. In 567, diplomats from the Eastern Roman Empire reported the arrival of a new group from the east on the shores of the Caspian Sea. The newcomers called themselves the Avars, and claimed to be related to a far-off people known as the Rouran.

However, it&#x27;s unlikely that Rouran would have migrated to Europe in any sufficient strength to establish themselves there, due to the desperate resistances, military disasters, and massacres. The remainder of the Rouran fled into China, were absorbed into the border guards, and disappeared forever as an entity. The last khagan fled to the court of the Western Wei, but at the demand of the Göktürks, Western Wei executed him and the nobles who accompanied him.

The Avars were pursued west by the Gokturks as most-wanted fugitives and accused of unlawfully usurping the imperial title of Khagan and also the prestigious name of the Avars. Contemporary sources indicate the Avars were not native to the Western Steppe but came to the region after a long wandering. Nor were they native to Central Asia to the south of which lay the Hephthalite Empire which has on and off been identified with the Avars by certain scholars. Instead the Avars&#x27; origins were further to the east, a fact which has been corroborated through DNA studies of Avar individuals buried in the Pannonian Basin which have shown that they were primarily East Asian. Their pretensions to empire despite their relatively small numbers indicate descendance from a previously hegemonic power in the Far East. The first embassy of the Avars to Justinian I in 557 corresponds directly to the fall of the Rouran Khaganate in 555. The Rouran Khaganate had fallen not through gradual decline but through a sudden internal revolution led by the Göktürks, hence the still vivid memories of empire in the Avar Khagan, a fact paralleled later by the Kara-Khitans who migrated a long distance west after being suddenly dislodged from northern China but still kept their pretensions to empire and defeated the Great Seljuk Empire in the Battle of Qatwan as the Western Liao. The Hephthalite Empire in southern Central Asia would not fall to the Göktürks until 560. The Hephthalites themselves had previously been vassals to the Rouran and adopted the title Khagan from them. They were also already known as the Hephthalites to the Byzantines. In view of these facts a strong Rouran component in the Avar Khaganate has been seen as likely, although the Khaganate later included many other peoples such as Slavs and Goths.

==Genetics==
 examined the remains of a Rouran male buried at the Khermen Tal site in Mongolia. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup C2b1a1b and the maternal haplogroup D4b1a2a1. Haplogroup C2b1a1b has also been detected among the Xianbei.

Several genetic studies have shown that early Pannonian Avar elites carried a large amount of East Asian ancestry, and some have suggested this as evidence for a connection between the Pannonian Avars and the earlier Rouran. However, Savelyev &amp; Jeong 2020 notes that there is still little genetic data on the Rouran themselves, and that their genetic relationship with the Pannonian Avars therefore still remains inconclusive.

== Language ==

The received view is that the relationships of the language remain a puzzle and that it may be an isolate. Alexander Vovin (2004, 2010) considered the Rouran language to be an extinct non-Altaic language that is not related to any modern-day language (i.e., a language isolate) and is hence unrelated to Mongolic. Vovin (2004) notes that Old Turkic had borrowed some words from an unknown non-Altaic language that may have been Rouran. In 2018 Vovin changed his opinion after new evidence was found through the analysis of the &quot;Brāhmī Bugut&quot; and &quot;Khüis Tolgoi&quot; inscriptions and suggests that the Rouran language was in fact a Mongolic language, close but not identical to Middle Mongolian.

== Rulers of the Rouran ==
The Rourans were the first people who used the titles Khagan and Khan for their emperors, replacing the Chanyu of the Xiongnu. The etymology of the title Chanyu is controversial: there are Mongolic, Turkic, and Yeniseian versions.

<doc id="312626" wikidata="Q486292" url="?curid=312626" title="The Anarchist Cookbook">
<text>The Anarchist Cookbook, first published in 1971, is a book containing instructions for the manufacture of explosives, rudimentary telecommunications phreaking devices, and related weapons, as well as instructions for the home manufacture of illicit drugs, including LSD. It was written by William Powell at the apex of the counterculture era to protest against United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War. Powell converted to Anglicanism in 1976 and later attempted to have the book removed from circulation. However, the copyright belonged to the publisher, who continued circulation until the company was acquired in 1991. Its legality has been questioned in several jurisdictions.

== History ==
=== Creation ===
&quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; was written by William Powell as a teenager and first published in 1971 at the apex of the counterculture era to protest against the United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War. Powell gained inspiration for his text from his experiences with Vietnam veterans while living in New York City, during which time the pacifist movements of the 1960s began to take a more violent turn. Powell began plans to become a writer but decided upon a political course when he was drafted into the Vietnam war, which inspired him to write &quot;recipes&quot; and later compile them into a &quot;cookbook&quot;. The initial vision of &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; was to post instructional flyers in New York City, including how to properly throw a Molotov cocktail and how to make LSD. These &quot;recipes&quot; were eventually adapted to make up an entire book. From 1968 to 1970, Powell began researching in the &quot;U.S. Combat Bookshelf&quot; at the New York Public Library, including mainstream external texts such as &quot;The Boy Scout Handbook&quot;, and anarchist texts like &quot;Fuck the System&quot; by Abbie Hoffman. The initial manuscript was sent to Lyle Stuart in 1970.

Powell stated &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; was initially designed as a book meant to provide education to &quot;the silent majority&quot; of the American population. He described that the book was not intended for extant political fringe organizations but was designed to galvanize a great societal change by inciting the general population. The ultimate goal of the text was to provide the general population with the skills and capabilities to organize against fascist, capitalist, and communist threats. Powell stated: &quot;The central idea to the book was that violence is an acceptable means to bring about political change,&quot; a sentiment that he would renounce later in life.

=== Author&#x27;s remorse ===

After writing the book as a teenager, Powell converted to Anglicanism in 1976 and later attempted to have the book removed from circulation. In 1979, Powell left the US, traveling to the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. He worked as a faculty member for international schools backed by the US. During this time, he began writing about pedagogy and conflict resolution. This led him to renounce his book and instead campaign for its withdrawal from publication. He was unable to legally stop the publication of &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; because the copyright had been issued to the original publisher Lyle Stuart, and subsequent publishers that purchased the rights have kept the title in print. Powell publicly renounced his book in a 2013 piece calling for the book to &quot;quickly and quietly go out of print&quot;. 

Powell had difficulty finding employment throughout his life, having described the book as &quot;a youthful indiscretion or mistake that can haunt someone during their early years or even longer.&quot; In 2011, Powell and his wife, Ochan Kusuma-Powell, founded Next Frontier: Inclusion, a non-profit organization for children with developmental disabilities and learning disabilities; described it as a means to atone for writing the text. William Powell died of cardiac arrest on 11 July 2016.

=== Publication status ===
Powell originally sent the manuscript to over 30 publishers until Lyle Stuart bought the book and its copyright. Powell received royalties for the book, approximately $35,000 until he split with the company in 1976. Despite Powell&#x27;s protest against the continued publication of the text, the copyright of the book never belonged to its author, but to its publisher, Lyle Stuart Inc.. The publisher agreed to publish the text as an attempt to defy efforts by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to obtain lists of people who checked out books that were deemed subversive. Stuart kept publishing the book until the company was bought in 1991 by Steven Schragis, who decided to drop it. Out of the 2,000 books published by the company, it was the only one that Schragis decided to stop publishing. Schragis said publishers have a responsibility to the public, and the book had no positive social purpose that could justify keeping it in print. The copyright was bought in 2002 by Delta Press (a.k.a. Ozark Press), an Arkansas-based publisher that specializes in controversial books, where the title is their &quot;most-asked-for volume&quot;. As of 2016, over two million copies of the book have been sold.

== Content summary ==

=== Foreword ===
&quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; begins with a Foreword section, detailing the author&#x27;s intentions for the text. At the time of writing, Powell believed that the United States was slowly declining towards communism, thus he found it necessary to write a book that guided people on revolution against this transition. He championed the idea of &quot;bringing America back to where she was two hundred years ago&quot;, believing his revolutionary ideals to be reactionary, rather than proactive. Powell begins with his vision for the book in how it is intended to educate and galvanize the public to make tangible change in their home countries. Powell states that fringe political organizations, such The Minutemen and The Weathermen, are not the intended audience, rather it is written for &quot;the silent majority&quot;. Powell envisioned the United States people rebelling against what he deemed to be oppressive capitalistic ideals, and to a lesser extent, against fascist and communist movements.

=== Content ===
Powell begins the content of his book by discussing anarchy and anarchist theory. Anarchy, by his definition, is a wide-scale mass uprising by the people, similar to that of civil disobedience through violence. He believed that anarchy was the innate state of all individuals, and therefore human nature would drive people to participate in such practices. Powell believed that current expressions of politics, arts, music, and education all contained innate principles of anarchist ideals, thereby equating anarchism to individualism. This principle drives Powell&#x27;s argumentation as he believed that the current political climate and the Vietnam war had undermined human values, therefore revolution based upon his perception of human dignity and freedom was what drove him to write the piece. He ends his introduction by warning of the seriousness that these recipes may have deadly consequences if used improperly. The chapters of &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; include descriptions and detailed instructions in hand-to-hand combat, explosives, booby traps, drugs, tear gas, sabotage and demolition, surveillance, improvised weapons, and other topics related to anarchism.

== Reception ==

=== Legal reviews ===
At the time of its publication, one FBI memo described &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; as &quot;one of the crudest, low-brow, paranoiac writing efforts ever attempted&quot;. The book was reviewed by the Department of Justice, the White House, the FBI, and by both John Dean and Mark Felt, Richard Nixon&#x27;s lawyer, and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s associate director respectively. While having concerns about the text, the FBI concluded that it could not be regulated as it was published through mass media. Furthermore, the FBI ruled that &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; does not incite &quot;forcible resistance to any law of the United States&quot; and is therefore protected under the First Amendment. While much of the text was deemed to be inaccurate, the FBI concluded that the chapter on explosives &quot;appears to be accurate in most respects&quot;. Since its conception, the FBI has kept records of the book, releasing the bulk of its investigation file in 2010.

=== Anarchism ===
The anarchist collective CrimethInc., which published the book &quot;Recipes for Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook&quot; in response, denounces the earlier book, saying it was &quot;not composed or released by anarchists, not derived from anarchist practice, not intended to promote freedom and autonomy or challenge repressive power – and was barely a cookbook, as most of the recipes in it are notoriously unreliable&quot;.

== Media presence ==

=== Internet/media ===

Much of the publication was copied and made available as text documents online through Usenet and FTP sites hosted in academic institutions in the early 1990s, and has been made available via web browsers from their inception in the mid-1990s to the present day. The name varies slightly from &quot;Anarchist Cookbook&quot; to &quot;Anarchy Cookbook&quot; and the topics have expanded vastly in the intervening decades. Many of the articles were attributed to an anonymous author called &quot;The Jolly Roger&quot;.

Knowledge of the book, or copied online publications of it, increased along with the increase in public access to the Internet throughout the mid-1990s. Newspapers ran stories about how easy the text was to get hold of, and the influence it may have had with terrorists, criminals, and experimenting teenagers.

=== Film ===

The book served as a central element of the 2002 romantic comedy &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot;. Repercussions from the book&#x27;s publication, and the author&#x27;s subsequent disavowal of its content, were the subject of the 2016 documentary film &quot;American Anarchist&quot; by Charlie Siskel. In the film, William Powell explains in depth his thoughts on the book and the consequences it had in his life. It further explores the themes of responsibility and repercussions that decision can have on one&#x27;s life. Powell&#x27;s death in 2016 received little media coverage until the release of &quot;American Anarchist&quot;, which was released a few months after his death.

==Legality==
===United Kingdom===
Possession of &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; without reasonable excuse is a criminal offence and has been successfully prosecuted under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

=== Notable incidents of alleged possession ===

* 1973: Two bombings of military recruitment centers in Portland, Oregon, US by anti-war activists in a conspiracy which included academic and bookseller Frank Stearns Giese, following which it was claimed in court that &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; was part of the group&#x27;s library. 
* 1976: Police linked the bombing of Grand Central Terminal and hijacking of a TWA flight to Croatian radicals who used instructions from &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook.&quot;
* 1981: &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; was linked to Puerto Rican rebels who bombed an FBI headquarters using the book&#x27;s directions. Thomas Spinks also referred to the text during the bombings of 10 abortion clinics in the United States.
* 2002: The Canadian government permitted the book to be imported from the United States. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency concluded the book does not violate either hate or obscenity laws, therefore the previous ban on the text was resolved.
* 2005: The London public-transport bombers were linked to the book.
* 2007: A 17-year-old was arrested in the United Kingdom and faced charges under anti-terrorism law in the UK for possession of &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot;. He was cleared of all charges in October 2008, after arguing that he was a prankster who just wanted to research fireworks and smoke bombs.
* 2010: In County Durham, UK, Ian Davison and his son were imprisoned under anti-terrorism laws for the manufacturing of ricin. Their possession of &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot;, along with its availability, was noted by the authorities. This led to a London judge and police campaigning to have the book banned in the UK.
* 2012: &quot;The Anarchist Cookbook&quot; was found to have been in the possession of James Holmes, the perpetrator of the Aurora theater shooting in Colorado, USA.
* 2013: Renewed calls were made in the United States to ban the book, citing links to a school shooting in Arapahoe, Colorado, and the 2013 Santa Monica shootings by Karl Pierson.
* 2015: U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein pushed to have the book removed from online databases.
* 2016: The book was refused classification by the Office of Film and Literature Classification upon release, thus making the book banned in Australia. It was classified RC again on 31 October 2016.
* 2017: Joshua Walker, a 27-year-old was prosecuted in the UK solely for the possession of the book. He was found not guilty.
* 2021: Oliver Bel, a 23-year-old mathematics graduate of the University of Cambridge, was convicted of &#x27;collecting information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism&#x27; for possessing the book and received a sentence of 3 years&#x27; imprisonment, despite adducing evidence that he possessed the book for academic research purposes.
* 2021: Ben John, a 21-year-old student, was found guilty of possessing a copy of the book on a computer hard drive; he was given a suspended sentence and told by a UK judge to &#x27;read classical literature&#x27;, such as &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, only for the Court of Appeal to rule that order unlawful, sentencing John to three years: two years in custody, one year on licence.

<text>In computer security, WinNuke is an example of a Nuke remote denial-of-service attack (DoS) that affected the Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows 3.1x computer operating systems and Windows 7. The exploit sent a string of out-of-band data (OOB data) to the target computer on TCP port 139 (NetBIOS), causing it to lock up and display a Blue Screen of Death. This does not damage or change the data on the computer&#x27;s hard disk, but any unsaved data would be lost.

==Details==
The so-called OOB simply means that the malicious TCP packet contained an Urgent pointer (URG). The &quot;Urgent pointer&quot; is a rarely used field in the TCP header, used to indicate that some of the data in the TCP stream should be processed quickly by the recipient. Affected operating systems did not handle the Urgent pointer field correctly.

A person under the screen-name &quot;_eci&quot; published C source code for the exploit on May 9, 1997. With the source code being widely used and distributed, Microsoft was forced to create security patches, which were released a few weeks later. For a time, numerous flavors of this exploit appeared going by such names as fedup, gimp, killme, killwin, knewkem, liquidnuke, mnuke, netnuke, muerte, nuke, nukeattack, nuker102, pnewq, project1, , simportnuke, sprite, sprite32, vconnect, vzmnuker, wingenocide, winnukeit, winnuker02, winnukev95, wnuke3269, wnuke4, and wnuke95.

A company called SemiSoft Solutions from New Zealand created a small program, called AntiNuke, that blocks WinNuke without having to install the official patch.

Years later, a second incarnation of WinNuke that uses another, similar exploit was found.

<doc id="312639" wikidata="Q836789" url="?curid=312639" title="Riddler">
<text>The Riddler (Edward Nigma, later Edward Nygma or Edward Nashton) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bill Finger and Dick Sprang, and debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #140 in October 1948. He has become one of the most enduring enemies of the superhero Batman and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

In his comic book appearances, the Riddler is depicted as a criminal mastermind in Gotham City. He has an obsessive compulsion to incorporate riddles, puzzles, and death traps in his schemes to prove his intellectual superiority over Batman and the police. His real name—Edward Nigma—is a pun itself; an &quot;enigma&quot; is a person or thing that is difficult to understand. With this self-conscious use of an elaborate gimmick, the Riddler&#x27;s crimes are often theatrical and ostentatious. The character commonly wears a domino mask and either a green unitard decorated with question mark prints or a green suit and bowler hat. A black, green, or purple question mark serves as his visual motif. He commonly says &quot;Riddle me this&quot;, before stating his iconic riddles.

The Riddler has been adapted into numerous forms of media, having been portrayed in live action by Frank Gorshin and John Astin on the 1960s television series &quot;Batman&quot;, Jim Carrey in the 1995 film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, Cory Michael Smith on the 2014 Fox series &quot;Gotham&quot;, and Paul Dano in the 2022 film &quot;The Batman&quot;. John Glover, Robert Englund, Wally Wingert, and others have provided the character&#x27;s voice ranging from animation to video games.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Golden Age ===

The character&#x27;s origin story recounts Edward Nigma&#x27;s fascination with puzzles from a young age. After a teacher announces that a contest will be held over who can solve a puzzle the fastest, Nigma sets his sights on winning this, craving the glory and satisfaction that will come with the victory. He breaks into the school at night to practice the puzzle until he is able to solve it in under a minute. Due to this he wins the contest and is given a book of riddles as a prize. His cheating rewarded, Edward embraced the mastery of puzzles of all kinds, eventually becoming a carnival employee who excelled at cheating his customers out of their money with his bizarre puzzles and mind games. He soon finds himself longing for greater challenges and thrills and dons the disguise of the &quot;Riddler&quot; to challenge Batman, believing him to be a worthy adversary. In his first encounter with the Dynamic Duo, Riddler first tried to confound the crime-fighters with his infamous double-entry Riddle Clues and then tried to kill them both in a booby-trapped glass maze on a pier, sealing the door so they could not leave the structure before it exploded, only for Batman and Robin to escape and the Riddler &quot;vanishing&quot; after getting knocked into the sea by the explosion, leaving only his trademark &quot;?&quot; floating in the water.

=== Silver and Bronze Age ===

Riddler&#x27;s origin is the same as his Golden Age counterpart. The first Silver Age appearance of the Riddler introduced the villain when he was released from prison. Upon release, the Riddler swore he would no longer leave clues to his crimes. However, during his first attempt at a robbery he discovers that leaving clues has become a compulsion. The Riddler would go on to have more than a dozen appearances during the Silver and Bronze Age. Some notable appearances included a team-up with the Joker and Penguin, where the villains used an experimental gas on Batman to turn the hero into a Bat-Hulk. The Riddler also faced Elongated Man in one story, and later the Riddler was lured into a team-up with Batman, where the unlikely pair investigated the kidnapping of a mystery writer.

The Riddler was one of several villains who claimed to have killed Batman. These claims were debunked during a super-villain trial, during which the Riddler was cross-examined by Bruce Wayne, who was disguised as Lex Luthor at the time.

In the later Bronze Age, Riddler was among the villains recruited by Joker to take down Killer Croc. They were defeated by Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul

Near the end of the Bronze Age, the Riddler went into hiding, working in a winery. Eventually he is inspired to return to crime and lured Batman into a storybook theme park.

During the Riddler&#x27;s last pre-Crisis appearance, the villain was released from prison (along with most of Batman&#x27;s other enemies) by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Each villain is offered ten million dollars to kill Batman.

===Post-Crisis===
In &quot;&quot;, the Riddler appears as an informant. The Riddler is hired by Carmine &quot;The Roman&quot; Falcone to tell him the identity of the Holiday Killer. Falcone eventually loses his patience with Riddler and has his daughter throw him out on the 1st of April. Outside Falcone&#x27;s he is confronted by Holiday who fires several shots at him without harming him due to it being April Fool&#x27;s, the killer also leaves several items pertaining to their identity at the scene. This may be why Riddler was left alive, as matters are traditionally reversed on the holiday. He appeared again in the same chapter of the story in which Harvey Dent is disfigured when Batman comes to him for information about the attack.

He plays a slightly larger role in the story&#x27;s sequel &quot;&quot;, in which Batman turns to him to figure out the significance of the lost games of hangman that are left at the scenes of the Hangman killer&#x27;s crimes. He later showed up as a member of Two-Face&#x27;s jury during the Hangman&#x27;s trial.

In &quot;&quot;, he joins Selina Kyle on a trip to Italy in search of his fellow rogue&#x27;s origins. It is there that he manipulates her into believing that some of Batman&#x27;s most dangerous foes are after her. He has his henchmen employ several gimmicks and weapons used by the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze and the Joker to achieve this. He hopes to extract Batman&#x27;s real identity from her, but to his dismay, she actually does not know or care.

The Riddler appears in &quot;The Question&quot; series, being convinced to become a &quot;big-time villain&quot; by a prostitute he meets on a bus. He hijacks the bus and begins asking riddles, killing and robbing anyone that gets them wrong. Question quickly subdues him by asking him philosophical riddles in return. He is outwitted and has a mental breakdown before being set free as a reward for getting one last riddle right.

In the one-shot &quot;Riddler: The Riddle Factory&quot;, the Riddler becomes the host of an underground game show that focuses on digging up dirt on celebrities. Many of the famous people that he humiliates end up creating insincere apology videos shortly afterward, suggesting that perhaps Riddler did a good thing. In the end, his actions turn out to be a front for his attempts to find the hidden treasures of &quot;Scarface&quot; Scarpelli, a Gotham City gangster who lived long before Batman&#x27;s reign of crimefighting.

In the three-part &quot;&quot; storyline &quot;The Primal Riddle&quot;, written by Steve Englehart, the Riddler engineers one of his greatest deathtraps: Batman is thrown into a narrow pit that is slowly filling up with water. The walls are electrically wired, and a set of bumpers are the only thing that prevents the water from touching the walls and causing Batman to die by electrocution. The only options Batman appears to have are death by electrocution and death by drowning, but as always, Batman manages to tamper with the trap&#x27;s design and develop a route of escape. After Harley Quinn briefly breaks free of her devotion to the Joker, she attempts to hold up a large party at Wayne Manor, only to find that the Riddler is targeting the building also. The two gangs engage in a firefight, but Harley gains the upper hand when Big Barda (who was secretly allied with her at the time) interrupts the conflict and captures the Riddler and his men. During the storyline, Riddler makes constant allusions to a &quot;mystery&quot; that is hidden within the mansion, and after his apprehension, damage done to the building causes the entrance to the Batcave to open. Riddler sees this, and then declares that he has &quot;solved the riddle of Wayne Manor&quot;. During this period, he attacks Black Canary and Green Arrow in Star City, and he is easily defeated. This event helps lay the foundations for Riddler&#x27;s future confrontations with Green Arrow.

During a crisis caused when Wonder Woman&#x27;s Lasso of Truth was broken, resulting in the laws of truth breaking down and causing reality to be shaped by the perceptions of individuals, one of the symptoms was when Batman found himself unable to solve any of the Riddler&#x27;s riddles but was nevertheless still able to defeat the villain when even he couldn&#x27;t figure them outmost likely reflecting the public idea of Riddler&#x27;s puzzles being insolubleclaiming that he managed to &quot;improvise&quot; to defeat Riddler. His low reputation among heroes and villains was reflected when the Flash noted that Batman having trouble with Riddler was a clear sign that the world was ending.

===&quot;Batman: Hush&quot;===
In the 12-part storyline &quot;&quot;, it is revealed that Riddler suffers from cancer (specifically a brain tumor), which also afflicted the mother of Dr. Thomas Elliot. Riddler uses one of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s Lazarus Pits to cure himself and offers Elliot the chance to cure his mother as well, provided he pays a large sum of money. However, Elliott is, in fact, eager for his mother to die to inherit her fortune. Elliott, who goes on to secretly become the masked criminal Hush, explains he wants to get revenge on his childhood friend Bruce Wayne. The two of them agree to work together and Riddler sets Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Joker, Clayface, and Scarecrow out to destroy Batman, with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, Talia al Ghul, and Lady Shiva being temporarily drawn into the scheme as well.

During the psychotic break that follows exposure to the Lazarus Pit, the Riddler deduces Batman&#x27;s secret identity; he then reveals his knowledge to Hush. He has Clayface shapeshift into the form of Batman&#x27;s (presumed dead) protégé Jason Todd to torment Batman, who is haunted by the former Robin&#x27;s death. Batman first thinks that Riddler had stolen Todd&#x27;s corpse and hidden it, but it was revealed in a later storyline, &quot;&quot;, that Todd was alive the whole time and had personally played a role in Riddler and Hush&#x27;s scheme. When the Riddler threatens to expose Batman&#x27;s secret identity, Batman mockingly labels it an empty threat. He points out that if Riddler revealed the answer to the riddle &quot;Who is Batman?&quot;, it would become worthless, something Riddler would not be able to stand. In addition, Batman warns him that if he reveals the secret, it would give Ra&#x27;s al Ghul a vital clue that he used a Lazarus Pit without his permission, and the League of Assassins would subsequently retaliate against him.

===Aftermath===
The fallout from the Riddler&#x27;s failed scheme is played out in &quot;&quot; #50-53. In the story &quot;Pushback&quot;, Hush reappears and beats Riddler senseless across a rooftop. Seeking refuge, Riddler goes to the Joker and the Penguin. He offers to tell the Joker who had killed his pregnant wife Jeannie if the Clown Prince of Crime would protect him from Hush. Joker immediately agrees, but eventually, Hush, with the help of the impostor Prometheus, defeats him, forcing Riddler to flee for his life. In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #797-799, the Riddler seeks shelter from Poison Ivy only to be humiliated when Ivy easily overwhelms and tortures him with her powers.

As revealed in &quot;Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight&quot; #185-189, the Riddler is stripped of his deductive powers and left to rot as a member of Gotham City&#x27;s vast and invisible homeless population. A chance encounter with an ex-NSA codebreaker gives him a positive environment in which to recover his mind. During that stay, he experiences an induced flashback that leads him to realize that his father had abused him many years ago. Envious of his son&#x27;s academic achievements in school, and unable to understand his brilliance, his father believed he had cheated on his accomplishments and beat him out of jealousy. Once Riddler discovers this, he is able to understand his lifelong obsession as born out of a traumatic compulsion to prove his intelligence. Having made this connection, the Riddler spends some of his vast fortunes, acquired over many years of crime, to get minor plastic surgery and extensive tattooing, covering most of his torso with his trademark question insignia. He returns and kills the codebreakerwho had pieced together his identity but could not act on itthen promptly steals a priceless scroll out from under Batman&#x27;s nose. In the years that followed, he largely turned away from crime to instead focus on gaining wealth and social influence.

After orchestrating a brutal series of assaults on Green Arrow, as revenge against his defeat at his hands during the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; era, Riddler gravely injures and almost kills both Green Arrow and Arsenal. He once again escapes before the Outsiders arrive to save them. Sometime between this incident and the events of Hush, Riddler was hired to steal artifacts imbued with mystical powers from one of Star City&#x27;s museums, and then distract the authorities so that the related rituals could be commenced. He sends Team Arrow on a wild goose chase around the city and then reveals that he has an atomic bomb housed in the stadium where the Star City Rockets play. However, as a side effect of the ritual performed with the artifacts, the city is plunged into complete darkness, and Green Arrow uses this to his advantage, moving in and apprehending the Riddler.

Riddler later shows up in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #1, with a group of villains, which includes the Fisherman and Murmur, attacking the Gotham City Police Department. He is next seen escaping Arkham Asylum during the worldwide supervillain breakout engineered by Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains days after the prior supernatural disaster. Riddler reappears as part of the Society&#x27;s &quot;Phase Three&quot; attack on Metropolis. He is defeated by the Shining Knight and is struck in the head by the Knight&#x27;s mace.

===Riddler reformed===
In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #822, the first of a series of issues written by veteran &quot;Batman&quot; writer Paul Dini, the Riddler returns, having spent much of the previous year in a coma due to brain damage after being struck in the head by Shining Knight. When he awakes, he is cured of his insanity and of his obsession with riddles, while retaining both his genius intellect and his mammoth ego. He subsequently reinvents himself as a private detective, taking on the murder case of a wealthy socialite. Hired by the socialite&#x27;s father, he proves that a photo of Bruce Wayne apparently implicating him in the crime depicts an impostor and briefly works with Batman to investigate the crime. He has suffered severe memory loss from the coma, and he barely remembers his own name. He does not appear to remember that Wayne and Batman are one and the same, although he does harbor some suspicions of once knowing something amazing about Wayne.

The Riddler is a guest along with Bruce Wayne on board a ship during a party. During the party, an old friend of Bruce&#x27;s falls overboard and is mauled to death by sharks. Riddler appears to solve the case with the suicide of the apparent murderer, and quickly takes the credit. However, Batman finds evidence that suicide was a setup to divert attention away from the real killer. Bruce suspects foul play, and eventually tracks down the killer, whom Riddler is also close to catching before Nigma is bludgeoned over the head by a shark-tooth club. The killer pushes Batman out the window and is about to drop him to his death, when Nigma wraps his tie around an arrow, lights it on fire, and shoots it into the killer&#x27;s back. As the assailant rolls around screaming, Nigma taunts him, refusing to douse the flames. Batman extinguishes the flame and responds to Nigma&#x27;s assertion that they are now allies with hostile dismissal.

The Riddler is then hired by Bruce Wayne to track down an experimental drug developed by Wayne Enterprises, currently being tested for muscle stamina and cellular regeneration, which has been stolen by corrupt lab assistant Lisa Newman. He discovers that Newman is staying at the same Athenian Women&#x27;s Help Shelter as Harley Quinn, falsely claiming to be an abuse victim. With Harley&#x27;s help, he defeats Newman and returns the drug to Wayne Enterprises, earning Batman&#x27;s trust for the time being.

In &quot;Countdown&quot; #42, Riddler claims to Mary Marvel that he has gone straight and is now a detective. The two join forces to defeat Clayface, and after witnessing Mary&#x27;s new malicious approach to crime-fighting, suggests that she consider finding a mentor to help her control her powers or at the very least get some anger management counseling. After a serial killer surfaces on the streets of Gotham City, the Riddler homes in on closing the case, only to find that the killer is actually one of his former victims out for revenge. The young man, whose girlfriend was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight between Nigma&#x27;s gang and security guards, captures Riddler and attempts to kill him, but Batman intervenes just in time and saves his former foe&#x27;s life.

In the 2008 mini-series &quot;Gotham Underground&quot;, Riddler investigates the Penguin&#x27;s involvement with the events of &quot;Salvation Run&quot;. He saves Dick Grayson working undercover during the Gotham Gang War between Penguin and Tobias Whale and deduces that Grayson is Nightwing.
He appears in &quot;&quot;, where he is hired by the Penguin to find Black Mask. To that end, he tracks down Selina Kyle, meeting up with Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy in the process.

In the &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; storyline, Poison Ivy is controlling the Riddler, keeping him in a nearly vegetative state so she can move into his house. When a villain named Boneblaster decides to make a name for himself by killing Catwoman, the fight ends up there. The house is severely damaged, but Riddler is freed from Ivy&#x27;s control in the process. Seeing his house in shambles, he takes his question mark cane off the wall and begins to savagely beat the already downed Boneblaster. In the third issue, Riddler attempts to solve a pair of unlikely suicides, the first being the second-best female tennis player in the world, the second an ace race car driver. During his re-enactment of one of the deaths, he is visited by both Catwoman and Poison Ivy, seeking his help in locating Harley after her abduction. Due to the events of the first issue, and Harley&#x27;s mental state, he quickly declines and brushes off Poison Ivy&#x27;s threats.

In his efforts, he discovers that these deaths are in fact homicides orchestrated by a serial killer who leaves subtle clues to the next victim within the body and time of death of the current victim. While attempting to alert the media, he provokes Dick Grayson, who is now acting as Batman. Almost instantly, Riddler deduces that the Batman before him is a new one. Additionally, Riddler reveals that the next victim will be the sister of the second victim, a young romance writer, something that Dick needed Alfred Pennyworth and the Batcave computer to figure out. In the end, Dick goes off to confront the killer, while Riddler agrees to look after the intended victim. After a brief, but an expected misunderstanding about Riddler&#x27;s intentions with the young woman, Dick phones in to announce that he has apprehended and questioned not one, but three killers about their intentions, but got no answers. Riddler almost leaves the woman to her life, when the lights go out unexpectedly. Riddler immediately concludes that Dick has not captured all of the killers, and pulls the woman out of harm&#x27;s way when a bomb goes off in front of her bookstore.

While Riddler and the writer hide as the smoke clears, three costumed assailants, enter the wreckage, looking for their victim to mark with their next riddle. The two men are led by a woman going by the moniker Conundrum, and their costumes sport black and green color schemes along with disturbingly familiar question mark emblazoned on their outfits. As Riddler stealthily disposes of the two grunts with his cane, Conundrum takes the writer hostage at gunpoint. Riddler deduces that Conundrum and her men are all college students who specialize in police sciences. Due to his famous rehabilitation, Conundrum&#x27;s group decided to fill the void with their debut murders. Conundrum admits that Riddler was her idol and that it would be a shame to kill him.

At this point, Riddler announces that Batman is &quot;en route&quot; to their very location, something both Conundrum and the writer have difficulty believing. Riddler claims that since his reform, he and Batman have become close and that his cane now has its own GPS that alerts Batman to his location whenever the question mark is twisted. Noting her disbelief, Riddler calmly asks Conundrum with a smirk, &quot;Why is this man smiling?&quot;. Just as the Riddler finishes his question, Dick shows up and knocks Conundrum out. Riddler then admits that he is completely baffled that Batman is indeed there since he was only stalling for time until he thought of something, leading him to wonder if there truly is a Bat-signal in his cane (a panel during Riddler&#x27;s &quot;bluff&quot; shows that there is indeed a Bat-signal in his cane, as a green question mark alongside a map shows up inside the Batmobile&#x27;s window). After the ordeal is over, the young writer hugs Riddler, thanking him for saving her life. Afterward, she and Riddler go out to dinner at a fancy restaurant, under Dick&#x27;s covert surveillance. Dick admits that Riddler is indeed on a path of recovery, but must still be watched. After washing up in the men&#x27;s room, Riddler sees a gossip show on closed-circuit television, showcasing a plainclothes Harley getting into a car with Hush disguised as Bruce Wayne. He then calls Selina and tells her to turn on her television. Sometime later, Riddler arrives at his office to find his secretary bound and gagged at her desk, with Harley, Ivy, and Selina waiting in his office. The women tell him that they are being framed for the murder of a young woman whose body was dropped into their pool, and they need his help to prove that they had no part in it. After examining the woman&#x27;s body, he finds that the women were telling the truth, only to be attacked by Dr. Aesop.

===Return to villainy===
In Tony Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Life After Death&quot;, Riddler appears early in the story at a gala party attended by Arkham, Dick Grayson, Huntress, and Oracle, hired by Penguin to find the Black Mask. As he chases Catgirl away from her robbery of the venue, the Riddler is rocked by a bomb detonation, the trauma re-awakening his psychosis. Cackling, rambling and insane, he terminates his contract with Cobblepot and disappears. In &quot;Riddle Me This&quot;, the Riddler still &quot;acts&quot; as a private eye and teams with Batman to solve the murders of a mysterious sorcerer named Sebastian Rothschild (aka Sebastian Blackspell). Blackspell is apprehended, but only after Batman suspects Riddler went to great lengths to orchestrate the ordeal, including poisoning himself with a nearly lethal dose of Joker gas to skirt suspicion and act on a grudge between him and Blackspell.

Riddler&#x27;s return to villainy is cemented in &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;. Investigating the Sensei&#x27;s attack on the Jade Society, Batman (Dick Grayson) is ambushed by Riddler and a young woman introduced as Enigma, Riddler&#x27;s daughter. Riddler and Enigma escape, delivering the Jade Society member list to Gilda Dent. Riddler is paid but is more interested in another reward, which Gilda promises after one more job. This occurs in &quot;Pieces&quot;, where Gilda reveals herself to her estranged husband Harvey, who is now the disfigured criminal Two-Face. She hires Riddler and Enigma to help Two-Face best Mario Falcone and reclaim his coin. The plan works; Riddler and Enigma defeat Batman and reunite the Dents. The Riddler is rewarded with multiple dossiers of himself. When Enigma calls him a has-been, Riddler retorts with a new riddle: &quot;What&#x27;s green and purple and bleeds profusely?&quot;. Enigma&#x27;s response is cut short by her scream, implying that the Riddler has murdered his own daughter.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Riddler appears as an inmate at Arkham Asylum in &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 2) #1. Redesigned in the style of the new titles, he sports a green mohawk in the shape of a question mark. Riddler appears in more traditional form in the short that concludes &quot;Batman&quot; #15 &quot;And Here&#x27;s the Kicker&quot;, the third part of &quot;Death of the Family&quot;. After it is revealed that Joker has secretly hijacked Arkham Asylum, Riddler is depicted as a current inmate, calmly biding his time and taunting guards. But when Joker appears and reveals his great respect for Riddler (as the villain whose dangerous intellect has kept Batman &quot;sharp&quot;), he uses Joker-gas to force Riddler to prove he could have escaped his cell anytime he wanted. To his chagrin, Riddler does and becomes quite alarmed when Joker shares a write-up of his plan to ambush Batman. Joker admits Riddler will have little part in his designs but should stick around for the &quot;show&quot; anyway.

The Riddler made an appearance in &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 2) #21, the opening book of the &quot;&quot; arc, where his surname is changed from Edward Nigma to Nashton or Nygma. The Riddler later appears in both the second and third chapters of the &quot;Zero Year&quot; storyline. In the canon, the Riddler is Batman&#x27;s first masked supervillain and is not only able to best Batman twice, but also takes control of Gotham, causing it to become a flooded wasteland where only the intelligent are meant to survive. Although the Riddler continues to be steps ahead of the Dark Knight, he is eventually defeated by the combined efforts of Batman, Commissioner James Gordon and Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox. He is later moved to Arkham Asylum.

Riddler appeared one more time in New 52 in the last three issues of &quot;The Flash&quot;. Holding a presumed dead Heat Wave hostage, it is revealed that the Riddler designed a range of deadly drones around Central City, drones that he had out-sourced to the CCPD. Alongside the Trickster (whose arm Edward had placed a bomb in), Riddler begins ruthlessly punching and beating the Flash (Barry Allen) before the speedster is quickly rescued by the Pied Piper. Riddler then threatens to have his drones open fire on the citizens of Central City once more. However, he is eventually defeated and imprisoned by a uniformed effort between the Flash and the Rogues.

===DC Rebirth===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. The Riddler makes his first true appearance in the new DC continuity relaunch in &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 3) #19. An inmate of Arkham once again, he rather cooperatively assists Bane in unlocking a high tech door, allowing Bane access to confront Batman.

In the eight-part story arc &quot;The War of Jokes and Riddles&quot;, commencing with &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 3) #25, flashbacks to a year after the events of &quot;&quot; have Batman recounting the details of a war between Riddler and Joker. He is first seen in custody at the GCPD, assisting them in solving a variety of crimes, including locating Joker&#x27;s whereabouts, before stabbing a police officer to death 26 times. Blackmailing the approaching guards with details of their children and families, Riddler walks out freely before intruding into Joker&#x27;s office. Riddler seemingly offers the Joker a partnership, acknowledging that if either of the two men individually kills Batman, the other will be left forever unsatisfied. However the Joker shoots Riddler in the stomach and quickly departs, Batman appearing through the window and giving chase. Left in a pool of his own blood, Riddler rose to his feet and limped out of the office, seemingly unfazed. Edward quickly healed from the wound, carving a question marked shaped scar over the wound, before murdering Dr. Jaime Knowles. Riddler is then seen meeting with Poison Ivy, discussing the Joker&#x27;s need to rid anyone who could potentially kill Batman before him. The duo is then ambushed by gunmen working for Carmine Falcone under the orders of the Joker to kill Riddler within the hour. However, Poison Ivy attacks the gunmen with her vines, allowing Edward and herself to leave.

Riddler eventually formed his team, consisting of himself, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Deathstroke, Clayface, Killer Croc, Two-Face, Firefly, and Victor Zsasz. Waging war on Joker&#x27;s team across Gotham, Riddler is responsible for poisoning Charles Brown&#x27;s son, resulting in his transformation into Kite Man who joins up with Joker&#x27;s team consisting of Cluemaster, Deadshot, Mad Hatter, Man-Bat, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, Solomon Grundy, and Ventriloquist. The war continues, with Riddler and Joker claiming territories across Gotham, before Riddler, who had convinced Batman to side with him during the conflict, blackmails and interrogates Kite Man into giving up Joker&#x27;s location. However Batman, after a brief fight between him, Riddler and Joker, becomes disgusted by Riddler&#x27;s actions and quickly grabs a blade, breaking his one rule of no killing to stab Riddler. However, Joker, who finally begins to laugh again, prevents Batman from doing so.

The present-day Riddler shows up next as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains who have placed Deathstroke on trial for appearing to have reformed. Riddler, using Hector Hammond&#x27;s abilities, convinces the Society that Deathstroke is indeed evil by showcasing a simulation of Deathstroke killing them all right before Deathstroke himself is kidnapped.

In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Riddler hosts an underground meeting with the other villains to talk about the Superman Theory. The meeting is crashed by Comedian who shoots Riddler in the leg.

===Infinite Frontier===
Riddler features in the Infinite Frontier one-shot Batman - One Bad Day: The Riddler #1, wherein he is given a revised origin. Here he is named Edward Tierney, a child prodigy with a genius level intellect who attends a prestigious private college where his father is the headmaster. Edward is a socially awkward child seemingly without social contacts besides his father, who pushes him extremely harshly in his studies. He also regularly beats and humiliates Edward due to him being the shameful result of a short lived affair with a prostitute. When Edward fails to get a full score on a test that ends with an unrelated riddle, he is beaten and humiliated even more. Edward tries to commit suicide, fails, and instead sneaks into the school archives and steals the test key for the upcoming course. The teacher finds out and is set to expel Edward from the school. He notes that getting expelled might actually be good for Edward, as he&#x27;ll still be brilliant but will also have experienced failure and might become a bit more relaxed. Hearing this, Edward snaps and beats the teacher to death. This sets Edward on the way to adopting the &quot;Nygma&quot; surname and becoming the Riddler. Due to other events in the story, it is unlikely that it is meant to be considered as canonical.

==Characterization==
===Skills and abilities===

The Riddler is a criminal genius capable of extraordinary lateral thinking in decoding and formulating puzzles of all kinds. As a private detective during the time he was reformed, he demonstrated investigative skills that rival those of the Dark Knight. However, Batman&#x27;s observations note that &quot;[Nigma] exhibits personality disorders consistent with a fanatic narcissist, egocentrism, and megalomania crossed with severe obsessive compulsion&quot;.

Like most of Batman&#x27;s enemies (and Batman himself), the Riddler has no superhuman abilities but is a highly cunning criminal strategist. He is not especially talented in fisticuffs (although his endurance has grown from having to engage in it over the years), but sometimes employs weaponry that exploits his gimmick, such as exploding jigsaw pieces, question-mark-shaped pistols, and his infamous question-mark staff, known to house a wide variety of technological devices and weapons. Still, his theme is flexible to his crimes, compared to similar criminals: all the Riddler requires is to be able to describe his threatened crime with a riddle or puzzle. Riddler once tried to commit crimes without leaving any clues using self hypnosis; however, he learned too late that while he was asleep his unconscious mind left riddling clues, causing Batman and Robin to capture him.
He is shown to be skilled with engineering and technology, having confronted Batman and Robin with unique and elaborate deathtraps. He is also well known for being Batman&#x27;s most intelligent adversary and in turn, has a grudging respect for Batman, in that he is the only adversary that has an intellectual genius equal to the Riddler.

However, the threat that Riddler actually poses is somewhat inconsistent across his various stories. His most formidable depictions emphasize his intelligence and cunning, portraying him as one of few rogues capable of seriously taxing Batman&#x27;s mental prowess, while also willing to take the precaution of obtaining firearms to deal with the superhero. Some recent depictions, however, have placed a derogatory focus on his flamboyant gimmickry and relative lack of major victories (even despite this applying to most of Batman&#x27;s enemies), portraying him as petty, overconfident, relatively harmless, and held in low esteem. The latter approach has proved polarizing, with some fans finding it wasteful in light of the character&#x27;s classic status and history of compelling stories, while others argue that most of his popularity has come from media other than his comic storylines and enjoy the notion of knowing that his &quot;real&quot; threat level is overrated. Since The New 52 reboot, Riddler has been consistently depicted as a serious threat, with notable successes.

===Relationships===
====Cluemaster====
The Riddler develops a working relationship with the Cluemaster, although he initially resents the villain for seemingly copying his modus operandi. In their first encounter, he sets his fellow rogue up with a bomb and sends Batman off chasing riddles that would lead to its defusing, as well as away from his real plan: to steal a vast amount of priceless baseball merchandise. The two team up on a few occasions afterward and work together on a big scheme shortly before Cluemaster&#x27;s apparent death in the pages of &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;.

====Query and Echo====
The Riddler once had two henchwomen named Query and Echo (real names Diedre Vance and Nina Damfino respectively) who first appeared in Detective Comics Annual Issue #8, July 1995. Once employees of an underground club called Pandora&#x27;s Box, became a duo biker gang robbing small convenience stores. One night, as they were attempting to rob another store, they forced a customer at gunpoint to surrender the goods, not knowing it was the Riddler who was about to start his criminal career. Seeing their potential, he hired the bikers and ultimately became Query and Echo (although some iterations include Quiz and Query).

Aside from their matching outfits (mostly unitards with fishnet leggings) and non-distinctive personalities, they differ in hair color and skin tone. Query has lighter skin, long blonde hair, and often wears what looks like a police cap. Echo has darker skin and short black hair. They exhibit great agility and combat skills. After several issues, Query and Echo have since made little appearances and brief mentions in both the comics and other mediums.

==Other versions==
As one of Batman&#x27;s most famed and popular adversaries, a number of alternate universes in DC Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Riddler that are not part of the official DC continuity, variations in which the character&#x27;s origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting.

===&quot;Joker&quot;===

A radically different interpretation of the Riddler is featured in Brian Azzarello and Lee Bermejo&#x27;s &quot;Joker&quot;. In this version, he wears a solid green jacket with question marks on the very back of it and a circle of question mark tattoos around his abdomen. His cane serves the purpose of helping to prop him up, due to a disabled leg. In the story, he sells an unknown substance to the Joker, who identifies him as &quot;Edward&quot;.

===&quot;Thrillkiller&quot;===
In the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; miniseries &quot;Thrillkiller&quot;, Nygma is a psychiatrist who counsels Barbara Gordon. Doctor Edward Nygma, author of &quot;Riddle Me This — What Do We Really Mean?&quot;, keeps Barbara dosed with increasing amounts of Valium and encourages her to mix with people that she actually loathes. Edward wears a green suit and the cushions of his couch bear the pattern of the Riddler&#x27;s outfit. Alfred, Barbara&#x27;s butler, takes the drugs away from her at the request of her father Commissioner Gordon, who considers Edward to be a quack.

===&quot;Batman: Earth One&quot;===
The Riddler appears in the graphic novel series &quot;&quot;. This version of the character is a nameless serial killer who puts people in life-threatening situations, all while questioning them in riddles, claiming that if they get it right, he will spare them; in fact, this is all a ruse, as he kills them regardless of whether they answer the riddles he proposes or not. Even though he is not obsessed with finding answers to most riddles, the Riddler does have an obsession with learning the Batman&#x27;s identity, which he considers to be the &quot;ultimate riddle&quot;.

In Volume Two, six months after the death of Mayor Oswald Cobblepot, the Riddler goes on a killing spree in Gotham City, hoping to get Batman&#x27;s attention. After a bombing, Batman chases the Riddler, but falls off a roof in the process of attempting to catch him. Though Batman finds the Riddler&#x27;s sewer-based hideout, he fails to stop him from bombing a rapid transit train. Using discovered clues, Batman deduces that these killings were not random; they were actually targeted, specifically that the Riddler is targeting the people who are trying to take over the remains of Cobblepot&#x27;s criminal network. Bruce is later accused of being the Riddler after the real Riddler frames him in an attempt to divert James Gordon&#x27;s investigation, but Jessica Dent is able to provide Bruce an alibi so he is not arrested. In the middle of a riot at the police precinct caused by the Riddler, Batman pursues the villain in a car chase and eventually subdues him with Waylon Jones&#x27; help. The Riddler is subsequently arrested by the Gotham City Police Department and brought up on 43 charges of murder.

===&quot;Batman/Judge Dredd: The Ultimate Riddle&quot;===
In the Batman/Judge Dredd crossover &quot;Batman/Judge Dredd: The Ultimate Riddle&quot;, the Riddler uses a reality-manipulating wand-like device he acquired during the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; crisis to pull Batman, Dredd, and six alien warriors together, intending to pit Batman against the other warriors and get him killed. However, Batman and Dredd are able to work together to overcome their opponents, culminating in Dredd shooting Riddler in the shoulder and Batman claiming the device, subsequently using it to return the survivors home.

===&quot;Justice&quot;===
The Riddler&#x27;s appearance in Alex Ross&#x27; 12 issue series &quot;Justice&quot; suggests a new motivation, that, as a child, he had been beaten by his father whenever he told a lie, to the extent that he was now psychologically incapable of telling a lie. His riddles are his method of subverting his condition so that he is still technically telling the truth, but always in as cryptic a manner as possible.

===Antimatter Universe===
The Riddler has a heroic counterpart in the antimatter universe called the Quizmaster, who is a member of Lex Luthor&#x27;s Justice Underground (that Earth&#x27;s version of the Injustice Gang) which opposes the evil Crime Syndicate of Amerika. He first appeared in &quot;JLA Secret Files 2004&quot; #1. He later has the right half of his face burned by Ultraman, leading him to don a half-face and temporarily take on the name &quot;Enigma&quot;. He last appeared in the &quot;Trinity&quot; series. As the New Earth Riddler slowly became a lighter, less criminal figure, Enigma became a darker figure in this series, attempting to join forces with Despero and Morgaine le Fay to perform a ritual that will allow them to &#x27;supplant&#x27; the Trinity of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman and gain the power to manipulate the multiverse. In the course of the series, it is revealed that Enigma seeks this power to save his daughter after she was mortally injured, but the ritual fails when Despero is replaced by one of his henchmen in an attempted coup, creating an imbalance that destabilizes reality until Trinity&#x27;s allies can regain enough of their own memories to help their loved ones come back to themselves. Similarly, on Earth-3, the Riddler&#x27;s heroic counterpart (simply Riddler) is married to Three-Face (Evelyn Dent) and is the stepfather to the Jokester&#x27;s daughter Duela Dent.

===&quot;Emperor Joker&quot;===
In the &quot;Emperor Joker&quot; storyline, the all-powerful Joker creates an alternate Riddler, known as &quot;Enigma&quot;, to be a member of the Joker&#x27;s League of Anarchy along with alternate versions of Poison Ivy and Bizarro. After learning of the Joker&#x27;s plans to destroy the universe, he leads the League in an uprising against him. The Joker&#x27;s vast and amazing powers cause the plan to fail, and the entire League is destroyed as a result.

===&quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;===
The Riddler can be heard saying &quot;ruh-riddle me this&quot; in &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;===
The Riddler appears in the miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, having been invited to a meeting of the Mankind Liberation Front by Lex Luthor. In this alternate future, the Riddler has become an old, bald man wearing glasses with question mark-shaped rims. He still indulges in his habitual riddling, asking &quot;Who is the Riddler?&quot; when Luthor referred to him by his real name. He appears to have been invited to the meeting only upon the insistence of Selina Kyle, as Luthor does not appear enthused by his presence.

===&quot;Batman: Crimson Mist&quot;===
In the third issue of the Batman vampire series &quot;Batman: Crimson Mist&quot;, the Riddler appears in a morgue where he shoots the mortician who was about to start an autopsy on a corpse, as the Riddler had stored a large number of drugs inside the body. The Riddler in that appearance has a big question mark-shaped scar on his face and another one on his chest with his navel being the dot. While shooting he cites what would be his final riddle: &quot;When Genius becomes dope plus &#x27;E&#x27; how does she redeem herself? Answer: By turning &#x27;Heroine&#x27; which minus the E is &#x27;Heroin&#x27;, lots of it and redeemable for lots of cash,&quot; at which vampire Batman appears and scolds the Riddler for graduating from robbery and extortion to drug trafficking and murder. In a panic, the Riddler begins to fire at Batman only to find that his bullets have no effect on him. Stunned, the Riddler asks Batman what he is, to which Batman replies: &quot;The answer to life&#x27;s every riddle: death and hungry darkness.&quot; With that, Batman proceeds to drain the Riddler of his blood.

===&quot;Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;===
In the &quot;Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; crossover, Riddler is turned into a mutant raccoon by the Shredder, along with other mutated inmates of Arkham Asylum. After Shredder is defeated by Batman and the Turtles, the police scientists have managed to turn him and the rest of inmates at Arkham back to normal and are currently in A.R.G.U.S. custody.

===&quot;Batman: White Knight&quot;===
The Riddler made a minor appearance in the 2017 series &quot;&quot;. Riddler, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a Joker who had been force-fed an overdose of pills by Batman, which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking liquids that had been laced with particles from Clayface&#x27;s body. This was done so that Napier, who was using Mad Hatter&#x27;s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface&#x27;s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Riddler and the other villains are then used to attack a library that Napier himself was instrumental in building in one of Gotham City&#x27;s poorer districts. Later on in the story, the control hat is stolen by the Neo-Joker (the second Harley Quinn, who felt that Jack Napier was a pathetic abnormality, while the Joker was the true, beautiful personality), in an effort to get Napier into releasing the Joker persona. Riddler also appears in the sequel storyline &quot;&quot;, being among the villains murdered by Azrael.

===&quot;Dark Knights of Steel&quot;===

Riddler (Named Fiddler in this version) first appears as one of the boys believed to be captured from Arkham Orphanage by Man Bat. He is seen with younger versions of Mad Hatter, Killer Croc and Jimmy White when Batman, Superman and Supergirl fight Kirk Langstrom. Jimmy then reveals that the group are actually being rescued by Kirk to get away from Elizabeth Arkham&#x27;s deadly experiments.

A grown up Fiddler then reappears as part of the King&#x27;s Banes Secret Six alongside Ragdoll, Scandal Savage and Cheshire. This version sports a Robin Hood style outfit with embroidered question marks and a wooden fiddle with a question mark shaped handle.

<text>The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario linking Toronto with the Niagara Peninsula and Buffalo, New York. The highway begins at the Canada–United States border on the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie and travels around the western end of Lake Ontario, ending at Highway 427 as the physical highway continues as the Gardiner Expressway into downtown Toronto. The QEW is one of Ontario&#x27;s busiest highways, with an average of close to 250,000 vehicles per day on some sections. 

Major highway junctions are at Highway 420 in Niagara Falls, Highway 405 in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Highway 406 in St. Catharines, the Red Hill Valley Parkway in Hamilton, Highway 403 and Highway 407 in Burlington, Highway403 at the Oakville–Mississauga boundary, and Highway427 in Etobicoke. Within the Regional Municipality of Halton the QEW is signed concurrently with Highway403. The speed limit is throughout most of its length, with the exception being between Hamilton and St. Catharines where the posted limit was raised to on September 26, 2019 as part of the government&#x27;s plan to raise the speed limits across the province.

The history of the QEW dates back to 1931, when work began to widen the Middle Road in a similar fashion to the nearby Dundas Highway and Lakeshore Road as a relief project during the Great Depression. Following the 1934 provincial election, Ontario Minister of Highways Thomas McQuesten and his deputy minister Robert Melville Smith changed the design to be similar to the autobahns of Germany, dividing the opposite directions of travel and using grade-separated interchanges at major crossroads. When opened to traffic in 1937, it was the first intercity divided highway in North America and featured the longest stretch of consistent illumination in the world. While not a true freeway at the time, it was gradually upgraded, widened, and modernized beginning in the 1950s, more or less taking on its current form by 1975. Since then, various projects have continued to widen the route. In 1997, the provincial government turned over the responsibility for the section of the QEW between Highway427 and the Humber River to the City of Toronto, which redesignated this segment as a westward extension of the Gardiner Expressway.
== Name and signage ==

The Queen Elizabeth Way was named for the wife and royal consort of King George VI who would later become known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. It is sometimes referred to as the Queen E.
In 1939, the royal couple toured Canada and the United States in part to bolster support for the United Kingdom in anticipation of war with Nazi Germany, and also to mark George VI&#x27;s coronation. The highway received its name to commemorate the visit; it was unveiled on June 7 as the King and Queen ceremonially opened the highway at a site near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. Originally, the highway featured stylized light standards with the letters &quot;ER&quot;, the Royal Cypher for &quot;Elizabeth Regina&quot;, the Latin equivalent to &quot;Queen Elizabeth.&quot; While mostly replaced with modern lighting masts like other Ontario highways, replicas of these stylized &quot;ER&quot; poles have been installed upon three bridges along the QEW: in Mississauga over the Credit River, in Oakville over Bronte Creek, and in St. Catharines over Twelve Mile Creek. In addition Highway 420 in Niagara Falls and its extension, Falls Avenue, has these &quot;ER&quot; light standards installed since 2002, as a nod to this route being part of the original QEW upon its inauguration in 1940 until being bypassed by QEW&#x27;s extension to Fort Erie in 1941.

The markers identifying the QEW have always used blue lettering on a yellow background instead of the black-on-white scheme other provincial highway markers use. They originally showed the highway&#x27;s full name only in small letters, with the large script letters &quot;ER&quot; placed where the highway number is on other signs. In 1955, these were changed to the current design, with the lettering &quot;QEW.&quot; Although the QEW has no posted highway number, it is considered to be part of the Province of Ontario&#x27;s 400-series highway network.
The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario designates the QEW as Highway 451 for internal, administrative purposes.

A monument was originally in the highway median at the Toronto terminus of the highway west of the Humber River bridges, dedicated to the 1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and known as the &quot;Lucky Lion.&quot; The column, with a crown at the top and a lion at the base, was designed by W. L. Somerville and sculptors Frances Loring and Florence Wyle for $12,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The monument was removed in 1972 in order to accommodate widening of the original QEW, and relocated in August 1975 to the nearby Sir Casimir Gzowski Park along Lake Ontario, on the east side of the Humber River.

== Route description ==

The QEW is a route that travels from the Peace Bridge – which connects Fort Erie with Buffalo, New York – to Toronto, the economic hub of the province. It runs as a freeway circling the western lakehead of Lake Ontario, cutting through Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Hamilton, Burlington, Oakville, and Mississauga en route. A portion of the freeway in Burlington is signed concurrently with Highway 403. Unlike other provincial highways in Ontario, the QEW is directionally signed using locations along the route as opposed to cardinal directions. Driving towards Toronto, the route is signed as &quot;QEW Toronto&quot; throughout its length. In the opposing direction, it is signed as &quot;QEW Hamilton&quot;, &quot;QEW Niagara&quot;, and &quot;QEW Fort Erie&quot; depending on the location.

=== Fort Erie–Niagara Falls ===
The Queen Elizabeth Way begins at the Canada–United States border on the three-lane undivided Peace Bridge, which connects with I-190 (via ) in Buffalo, New York. A customs booth is located just west of the bridge, beyond which a toll is charged to Canada-bound drivers. West of there, access is provided to nearby Highway 3 and the Niagara Parkway. Through customs, the four-lane freeway proper begins, immediately curving northwest. Within Fort Erie, interchanges provide access to and from the QEW at Central Avenue, Concession Road, Thompson Road, Gilmore Road, and Bowen Road. While there is some urban development at the beginning of the freeway, the majority of the first are within lowland forests. Numerous creeks flow through these forests, often flooding them. The Willoughby Marsh Conservation Area lies southwest of the freeway, approximately south of Niagara Falls. After an interchange with Lyons Creek Road, the freeway turns northward.

After crossing the Welland River, the original route of the Welland Canal, the freeway exits the forests and enters agricultural land surrounding the suburbs of Niagara Falls, which the highway enters north of the McLeod Road interchange. Within the city, Highway 420 meets the QEW at a large four-level junction and widens to six lanes. The opposing carriageways split at this interchange to accommodate the left-hand exit/entry of the flyover ramps accessing Highway 420, with the Toronto-bound traffic passing under these flyovers and a CN rail crossing. Exiting the northern fringe of Niagara Falls, the freeway again curves northwest and begins to descend through the Niagara Escarpment, a World Biosphere Reserve. Highway 405 merges with the QEW along the short rural stretch between Niagara Falls and St. Catharines. While there is no Toronto-bound access to Highway 405, Niagara-bound drivers can follow this short freeway to the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge, which crosses the U.S. border into Lewiston, New York. The QEW continues west into St. Catharines.

=== St. Catharines–Hamilton ===

As the Queen Elizabeth Way enters St. Catharines, it ascends the Garden City Skyway to cross the Welland Canal. This structure replaced the lift bridge south of it, one of two major bottlenecks prior to the early 1960s, and is one of two high-level skyways along the route. As the QEW was the first long distance freeway in North America, several modern engineering concepts were not considered in its original 1939 design, and although it was modernized in a recent reconstruction that concluded in 2011, further expansion of the highway is inhibited by the proximity of properties throughout most of its length. Consequently, most of the route beyond the Welland Canal is wedged between service roads which provide access to and from the QEW as well as to local businesses and residences. After passing the Ontario Street (Regional Road 42) interchange, the freeway crosses Martindale Pond, which forms the mouth of Twelve Mile Creek. West of the crossing is a trumpet interchange with Highway 406, which travels south to Welland, after which the QEW crosses out of St. Catharines and into the town of Lincoln at Fifteen Mile Creek, continuing with a six-lane cross-section.

Throughout Lincoln, the QEW travels along the Lake Ontario shoreline through the Niagara Fruit Belt; numerous wineries line the south side of the freeway. Interchanges at Victoria Road (Regional Road 24) and Ontario Street (Regional Road 18) provide access to the communities of Vineland and Beamsville, respectively. The latter encroaches upon the south side of the QEW, interrupting the otherwise agricultural surroundings of the highway in Lincoln. Immediately east of the Bartlett Avenue interchange, the freeway enters Grimsby, where it becomes sandwiched between the Niagara Escarpment and Lake Ontario. The route passes under three overpasses that have remained unchanged since the highway was built: Maple Avenue, Ontario Street, and Christie Street, all served by a single diamond interchange. South of the Fifty Point Conservation Area, the freeway exits the Niagara Region and enters the city of Hamilton.

Within Hamilton, the highway passes almost entirely within an industrial park, with interchanges at Fifty Road, Fruitland Road, and Centennial Parkway (formerly Highway 20). The third of these is intertwined with the Red Hill Valley Parkway interchange (completed in 2009), at which point the freeway widens to eight lanes. From here, the freeway curves northwest onto Burlington Beach and begins to ascend the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, the second high-level bridge along the route. As it crosses over the entrance to Hamilton Harbour, the freeway enters the Regional Municipality of Halton and descends into the city of Burlington.

=== Burlington–Oakville ===
After descending into Burlington, the QEW crosses North Shore Boulevard (former Highway 2) and Fairview Street/Plains Road as it passes by Mapleview Centre. Next to the Burlington Transmission Station, the QEW encounters the Freeman Interchange, originally opened in 1958 to allow construction of Highway 403 and reconfigured in the early 1990s to accommodate the western terminus of Highway 407.
The freeway turns to the east, becoming concurrent with Highway 403 through Burlington and Oakville. The two routes travel straight though a commercial office area. Service roads reappear through this stretch to serve businesses fronting the highway. The segment, which was expanded in 2011, is eight lanes wide, including one high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lanes) in each direction, which required the construction of a second structure over Sixteen Mile Creek. In the eastern end of Oakville, the route curves northeast, passing the Ford Motor Assembly Plant. Highway 403 then diverges north from the QEW while the QEW turns back to the east, entering Mississauga and the Peel Region.

=== Mississauga-Toronto ===

Within Mississauga, the freeway encounters its narrowest right-of-way, wedged between residential subdivisions on either side that prevent further expansion from its six-lane cross section. It crosses the Credit River valley, where a second bridge will soon be under construction. The segment east of the Credit River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but like the previous section, there is little room for more lanes without property acquisition. Some of the interchanges through Mississauga have ramp meters on the entrances onto the QEW, meaning only one vehicle is allowed to enter the on-ramp per each green light on a traffic signal, depending on the time of day, or the amount of traffic is on the highway at a certain time. After crossing Etobicoke Creek, which forms the boundary between Peel Region and Toronto, the route passes through a sprawling four-level interchange with Highway 427, as the freeway continues eastward as the municipal Gardiner Expressway.

The QEW formerly continued beyond the Highway 427 interchange to the Old Toronto city limits at the Humber River, although this section between was downloaded from provincial to municipal authorities on April 1, 1997 and became a westward extension of the Gardiner Expressway. Provincial control of the freeway ends shortly after an onramp from Highway 427; municipal ownership is evident from the use of different high-mast illumination poles that are shaded to reduce light pollution at the underpasses with Wickman Road and a railway line. East of that point the freeway retains its provincial-installed conventional lighting as it splits into a short collector-express system about ten lanes wide to serve the interchanges with Kipling Avenue and Islington Avenue. East of Grand Avenue, the municipality&#x27;s shaded high-mast lighting has been erected as the freeway crosses Parklawn Avenue and a CN rail line followed by offramps to Lake Shore Boulevard, then it curves as it passes the residential condominium towers of The Queensway – Humber Bay neighbourhood along the waterfront, the Mr. Christie cookie factory (which later became a part of Mondelēz International) and the Ontario Food Terminal on the north side, and then a tunnel leading to the Humber Loop streecar right-of-way. 

As the freeway crosses the west bank of the Humber River this marks the QEW&#x27;s old eastern terminus and the beginning of the Metro Toronto-constructed portion of the Gardiner. Coincidentally at the former eastern end of the QEW, the Metro-built Gardiner Expressway also assumed the provincial Highway 2 designation from Lake Shore Boulevard (from Lake Shore Boulevard&#x27;s on-ramp to the Gardiner), until most of Highway 2 was decommissioned in 1998 leaving both Lake Shore and the Gardiner without a provincial route number. This old demarcation line was quite visible on the freeway as a change in pavement quality and the use of different guardrail and lighting (since the late 1960s the province used conventional truss poles originally fitted with mercury halide lamps before being replaced by high-pressure sodium lamps in the 1990s, while Metro installed had the distinctive cobra-neck 30-foot (9.1 m) poles with fluorescent tubes that were since swapped for orange low-pressure sodium lamps in 1978). The Gardiner Expressway continues through downtown Toronto, and after crossing the Don River it ends at Lake Shore Boulevard (where it ceded the Highway 2 provincial routing back to Lake Shore until 1998), although a partial interchange connects to the Don Valley Parkway (DVP) which turns ninety degrees and heads northbound when it eventually meets Highway 401.

== History ==
===Toronto-Hamilton Highway===
As automobile use in southern Ontario grew in the early 20th century, road design and construction advanced significantly. A major issue faced by planners was the improvement of the routes connecting Toronto and Hamilton, which were consistently overburdened by the growing traffic levels.
Following frequent erosion of the former macadamized Lakeshore Road,
a cement road known as the &quot;Toronto–Hamilton Highway&quot; was proposed in January 1914.
The highway was designed to run along the lake shore, instead of Dundas Street to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since Lakeshore and Dundas were both overcrowded and in need of serious repairs. Construction began on November 8, 1914, but dragged on throughout the ongoing war.
It was formally opened on November 24, 1917, wide and nearly long. It was the first concrete road in Ontario, as well as one of the longest stretches of concrete road between two cities in the world. Though many minor improvements in alignment were made, the original highway was without modern bridges for the crossings of the Credit River and Bronte, Etobicoke, and Mimico Creeks.
Modern concrete arch bridges for all crossings except Bronte Creek were completed in 1919.

=== The Middle Road ===


Over the next decade, vehicle usage increased substantially, and by 1920 Lakeshore Road was again highly congested on weekends.
In response, the Department of Highways examined improving another road between Toronto and Hamilton. The road was to be more than twice the width of Lakeshore Road at and would carry two lanes of traffic in either direction.
Construction on what was then known as the &quot;Queen Street Extension&quot; west of Toronto began in early 1931 as a Great Depression relief project.

Before the highway could be completed, Thomas McQuesten was appointed the new minister of the Department of Highways, with Robert Melville Smith as deputy minister, following the 1934 provincial elections.
Smith, inspired by the German autobahns—new &quot;dual-lane divided highways&quot;—modified the design for Ontario roads,
and McQuesten ordered that the Middle Road be converted into this new form of highway.
A right-of-way was purchased along the Middle Road and construction began to convert the existing sections to a divided highway. Work also began on Canada&#x27;s first interchange at Highway 10.

By the end of 1937, the Middle Road was open between Toronto and Burlington. When it opened, it was the first intercity divided highway in North America
and boasted the longest continuous stretch of illumination in the world until the Second World War.

=== The New Niagara Falls Highway ===
McQuesten also foresaw the financial opportunities that came with cross-border tourism and opening the &quot;Ontario frontier&quot; to Americans. In 1937, construction began on a new dual highway from Hamilton to Niagara Falls (first known as the &quot;Hamilton-Niagara Falls Highway&quot;) along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment. This route was intended to connect with the Middle Road on the opposing shore of Lake Ontario. Work began at the end of March to grade the route between Stoney Creek and Jordan. The Hamilton-Niagara Falls Highway connected to the Middle Road via a trumpet junction known as the Burlington Interchange.
The prospect of removing hundreds of acres of farmland did not sit well with many, especially farmers in the path of the new highway. Rumours spread the prices paid for land were to be well below market value, and local protests erupted throughout the summer. However, the purpose of the new highway was to replace the congested, winding and hilly route of Highway 8 along the escarpment; several groups of collisions that summer gradually persuaded the public to support the new highway. By the autumn, of fruitland were cleared to make way for the route.

Over the next two years, numerous bridges and cloverleaf interchanges along the new highway were constructed. In addition, a large traffic circle was built in Stoney Creek to connect with Highway 20. The majority of this structural work was completed by June 1939. However, despite being opened to traffic between Stoney Creek and Jordan, the majority of the new route was gravelled. Over a ten-week period in the late spring and early summer of 1940, were paved, completing the four-lane highway between Hamilton and Niagara Falls.

It soon came time to name the new highway, and an upcoming visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth proved to be the focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June 7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along both the newly connected Toronto-Hamilton and Hamilton-Niagara Falls highways and passed through a light beam near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks to swing out, revealing a sign which read &quot;The Queen Elizabeth Way&quot;.

However, the ceremony only named the segment of the highway between St. Catharines and Niagara Falls as &quot;The Queen Elizabeth Way&quot;. The remainder of the road was still known by various names, including the &quot;Toronto–Burlington/Hamilton Highway&quot; and &quot;The New Middle Road Highway&quot;. On August 23, 1940, McQuesten cut a ribbon at the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines and officially declared the Queen Elizabeth Way open between Toronto and Niagara Falls, at which point the entire route was given the &quot;Queen Elizabeth Way&quot; name. Over a ten-week period in the late spring and early summer of 1940, were paved, completing the four-lane highway between Hamilton and Niagara Falls. 

Construction on an extension towards Fort Erie, which became known as the &quot;QEW Extension&quot;, was underway, but the ongoing war delayed its completion. As an interim measure, the unpaved highway was opened during the summer of 1941. Bypassed by the new QEW extension to Fort Erie in 1941, the Niagara Falls bridge approach became a spur route that was no longer part of the QEW so it was officially named the &quot;Rainbow Bridge Approach&quot; for the next three decades (until upgraded and designated as Highway 420 in 1972). Two lanes of pavement were laid in 1946, but the four-lane highway was not fully paved until 1956, with the portion from Niagara Falls to Fort Erie being the last to be fully paved. The entire route – from Toronto&#x27;s Humber River all the way to Fort Erie, all named as the QEW – was officially opened on October 14 of that year, completing the envisioned highway 25 years after work had begun.

===Obsolescence and subsequent reconstruction===
====1950s-1970s: replacement of at-grade intersections and drawbridges====
Despite some modern infrastructure, including traffic circles, interchanges, and some grade-separations, the majority of the new superhighway was not controlled-access. This meant exiting farmers and homeowners along several segments that were once concession roads were permitted to build driveways and entrances onto the road. In addition, the majority of the crossroads encountered along the route were at-grade intersections. This, combined with the ever-increasing number of automobiles, traffic jams, accidents, and deteriorating pavement, led the Department of Highways to state it had begun &quot;salvaging&quot; the QEW in its 1953 annual report.

The first new interchange opened at Dixie Road in 1953, beginning a seven-year program to make the Hamilton–Toronto section into a full-fledged freeway.
Over the next three years, the route was improved west to Highway 10 (Hurontario Street). This work was completed in early 1956. Service roads were installed and 13 intersections eliminated, resulting in a 50% reduction of the accident rate along that section.
In Toronto, work began in 1955 to construct the Gardiner Expressway, which would tie in with the end of the QEW. The first section of the Gardiner, connecting the QEW to Jameson Avenue, was officially opened by Metropolitan Toronto chairman Fred Gardiner and Premier Leslie Frost on August 8, 1958.
Work was also underway on the Toronto Bypass, involving the upgrade of Highway 27 to a freeway between the QEW and the new Highway 401. Construction began in 1953,
and included an reconstruction of the cloverleaf interchange with the QEW with larger loop ramps. This interchange would become one of the worst bottlenecks in the province only a decade after its completion, according to Highways Minister Charles MacNaughton.
On September 11, 1957, construction began to widen the QEW to six lanes between Highway 27 and the Humber River. It was completed by December 1958,
as were interchanges with Mississauga Road and Kerr Street.
Service roads allowed engineers to separate local access from the highway and avoid space-consuming interchanges in many places. Therefore, interchanges were only opened at Bronte Road (then Highway 25), Kerr Street, Royal Windsor Drive (then Highway 122), Southdown Road (now Erin Mills Parkway north of the interchange), Mississauga Road, Hurontario Street (then Highway 10), Cawthra Road, Dixie Road, and Highway 27.

Two major projects were ongoing near Burlington at this point. On April 29, 1952, the &quot;W.E. Fitzgerald&quot; struck the two-lane lift bridge at the entrance to Hamilton Harbour.
Damage to the crossing resulted in the QEW&#x27;s closure until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. Immediately west of the Guelph Line interchange, construction also began to improve access to the new bridge with the &quot;Freeman Diversion&quot;, a new routing of the QEW that would bypass the existing &quot;Middle Road&quot; section which passed through the community of Freeman that was becoming increasingly built-up, then connect to a new three-way junction (the &quot;Freeman Interchange&quot;) with the proposed Chedoke Expressway, and continue to the existing &quot;Burlington Interchange&quot; which would retain the underpass for &quot;Middle Road&quot; but be reconfigured to accept traffic primarily from the &quot;Diversion&quot;. Work on the new bridge and &quot;Diversion&quot; proceeded over the next six years.

The Freeman Diversion opened to traffic in August 1958,
with the old alignment becoming an eastward extension of Plains Road (still directly accessible via a split west of Guelph Line). Premier Frost opened the , four-lane skyway two months later on October 30. Although the skyway greatly reduced traffic delays, it was not without controversy due to its height, cost, tolling, and most especially its name. Residents in Burlington demanded it be named the Burlington Skyway, while Hamilton residents countered with the Hamilton Skyway. As a compromise, the Thomas B. McQuesten Skyway was proposed. However, the provincial government had the final say in the matter, and opted to name it the Burlington Bay Skyway. Tolls were collected beginning on November 10.

Elsewhere, in St. Catharines, planning was already advanced on a second skyway to cross the Welland Canal. The Homer Lift Bridge, a longstanding feature along Highway 8, was another point where the QEW narrowed to two lanes and traffic faced regular delays. Construction of the Homer Skyway, as it was tentatively known, began in July 1960 and progressed over the following three years. The $20 million (in $1963, adjusted for inflation) structure was officially opened by Premier John Robarts on November 15, 1963. However, traffic had already been flowing on the bridge since October 18.
As with the Burlington Bay Skyway, tolls were collected on the new bridge. However, the name was almost unanimously chosen by St. Catharines residents to be the Garden City Skyway. The collection of tolls on both skyways continued until December 28, 1973.

On September 15, 1960, the Shook&#x27;s Hill interchange, a rotary junction or grade-separated traffic circle (the only example in Ontario, although this interchange type is common in the United Kingdom), was completed at what is now Erin Mills Parkway. It was opened to traffic the following day, and completed the program to make the QEW a freeway between Burlington and Toronto.

A project to reconstruct the intersection with Brant Street into an interchange was completed 1964 and made the QEW a freeway between Hamilton and Toronto.

By 1963, work was underway to improve the Niagara Falls–Hamilton stretch of the QEW into a controlled-access highway.
At the end of 1966, the QEW was six lanes wide through Mississauga and Toronto, as well as between the Freeman Interchange and east of Brant Street.
This six-laning was extended west from Ninth Line to Kerr Street by 1968. The remaining section of four-lane highway along the Burlington to Toronto stretch, between Brant Street and Kerr Street, was reconstructed beginning in 1970 and completed by 1972.

The late 1960s and early 1970s also saw the complete reconstruction of three important interchanges: the Rainbow Bridge Approach (later Highway 420) in Niagara Falls, Highway 20 (Centennial Parkway) in Hamilton, and Highway 27 in Toronto. The former two were traffic circles in place since the QEW was opened in 1940; the third was a large cloverleaf interchange that had become outdated with the expansion of Highway 27 to twelve lanes throughout the 1960s. The connections with the Rainbow Bridge Approach and with Highway 27 required new massive high-speed interchanges to accommodate freeway-to-freeway traffic movements.
The four-level junction with Highway 27 was built over and required the construction of 19 bridges and the equivalent of of two-lane roadway, as well as the temporary diversion of QEW traffic to an overpass that would eventually be used for The Queensway. Construction began in September 1968, although preliminary work had been ongoing since 1966;
the interchange opened to traffic on November 14, 1969. Between the recently expanded Highway 27 (which would be renumbered as Highway 427 on December 4, 1971) and Lake Shore Boulevard, the QEW was also expanded to 8–10 lanes which included a short collector-express system between Kipling Avenue and Royal York Road.

Construction of the four-level interchange between the QEW and Rainbow Bridge Approach began in 1971, removing the two traffic circles along the approach at the QEW and Dorchester Road.
The interchange between the QEW and Lundy&#x27;s Lane (Highway 20) was also removed; instead, the new interchange provided access to Montrose Road.
The work was completed by April 1972, at which point the Rainbow Bridge Approach was designated as Highway 420.

Planning for the removal of the Stoney Creek traffic circle was completed by 1970, and reconstruction began in 1974.
This involved the removal of a rail line which crossed through the circle, and was the demise of one of two major features along the route. The new interchange opened in 1978,
completing the transformation of the QEW into a controlled-access highway.

During the late 1970s, construction was carried out on several new interchanges between Hamilton and Toronto. New interchanges at Dorval Drive and Trafalgar Road replaced the one at Kerr Street. In Mississauga, work commenced at Cawthra Road, while in Burlington a new interchange was built at Appleby Line.

==== 1980s to 1997: Growing capacity ====
Now functioning as a freeway, the QEW was already overburdened by the ever-increasing number of vehicles. The Burlington Bay Skyway, which was built to bypass Hamilton Harbour and the Port of Hamilton, was the lone four-lane link on the route between Hamilton and Toronto. It was initially designed to handle 50,000 vehicles daily, but by 1973 there were 60,000 vehicles crossing it. Preliminary work on a second parallel structure began a decade later in 1983. In July of that year, Transportation Minister James Snow broke ground for the new bridge. Construction was carried out over two years, and the twinned structure was opened on October 11, 1985. It was named the James N. Allan Skyway, in honour of James Allan, Minister of Highways during construction of the original skyway. The new name was not well received by locals, and debate erupted once again whilst the original bridge was closed and repaired for several years. It reopened on August 22, 1988, with Toronto-bound traffic crossing the original bridge. The twin structure was renamed the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, though it is commonly referred to as simply the Burlington Skyway.

Alongside the twinning of the skyway to eight lanes, the QEW was widened to at least six lanes from the Freeman Interchange to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, changeable message signs and traffic cameras were added to create a new traffic-management system called COMPASS. Modern interchanges were constructed for Fairview Street/Plains Road (steel tub girder bridges replaced the 1937-built structure originally used for the &quot;Burlington Interchange&quot;) and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway 2) including a collector lane for Niagara-bound traffic and on/off-ramps to Eastport Drive. Eastport Drive was built at the same time to relieve traffic on Beach Boulevard. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.
With the expanded capacity of the Burlington Skyway, and the unanticipated traffic volumes on Highway 403, the Freeman Interchange was now faced with a capacity problem. To resolve this, the renamed Ministry of Transportation began planning for the missing link of Highway 403 between Burlington and Mississauga that would run parallel to the QEW; this right-of-way would be sold to the 407 ETR consortium in 1995 and built as part of that route.

Work began in August 1991 to reconfigure the directional-T interchange to modern standards, which included realigning the QEW carriageways as mainline traffic, and adding a fourth leg for the future Burlington-Mississauga link. Due to land and cost constraints of the reconstruction, this necessitated replacing the directional ramp with a lower-capacity loop ramp for the movement from Toronto-bound QEW to the Brantford-bound Highway 403 (as some traffic was expected to be diverted away from the Burlington Skyway to the under-construction Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway and planned Red Creek Expressway). The rebuilt Freeman Interchange was partially opened on October 23, 1993 to serve the existing QEW and Highway 403 segments; the first sod for what would open as Highway 407 was turned that day. The completed ramps (the first to be built were cast-in-place post-tensioned bridges to cross Highway 403 westbound, followed in 2000 by precast girder bridges to pass over the North Service Road) connecting to the future Burlington-Mississauga freeway sat unused until that segment finally opened on July 30, 2001, as part of Highway 407 ETR.

Budgetary restraints in the 1990s forced the provincial government to sell off or download many highways to lower levels of government, or, in the case of Highway 407, to a private consortium.
As part of recommendations, the QEW east of Highway 427 to the Humber River was transferred to the responsibility of Metro Toronto. The transfer took place on April 1, 1997.
The city subsequently renamed it as part of the Gardiner Expressway. After the provincial downloading and Amalgamation of Toronto, this stretch of former QEW has remained largely unchanged though some segments have received a mix of high mast and low masts with shaded high pressure sodium lamps (similar to the Don Valley Parkway), while the old steel guardrail in the median was replaced by an Ontario &quot;tall-wall&quot; concrete barrier in 2007. Worn-out bilingual provincial signage have received unilingual replacements, while billboards which the province had long prohibited have been erected in proximity of the now-municipal freeway. At the partial interchange with Kipling Avenue, the offramp from the westbound collectors initially only led to Kipling Avenue North, but the City of Toronto changed it to a signalized junction in 2005 so that motorists exiting the freeway could access both directions of Kipling Avenue. 

=== Since 1998 ===
The Shook&#x27;s Hill rotary interchange (originally opened in 1960) with Erin Mills Parkway and Southdown Road, was completely reconstructed to a conventional parclo A4 from May 1999 to 2001.
The nearby Hurontario Street interchange, originally a cloverleaf junction, was reconfigured to a five-ramp parclo by 2010.

The Red Hill Valley Parkway, which opened on November 16, 2007, added a significant new interchange to the QEW.
The ramp to the southbound parkway did not open until December 2008.
The nearby interchange to Burlington Street had its 1958-built overpass replaced to accommodate the widening of the QEW to eight lanes, which included a collector lane on the Niagara-bound QEW to avoid weaving that otherwise would have resulted from the close proximity to the Red Hill Valley Parkway junction. Construction was completed in 2009.
From 1998 to 2003, the QEW between Brant Street and Guelph Line was expanded from four to eight lanes, necessitating the removal of the underused &quot;Freeman Diversion&quot; split including the Niagara-bound carriageway&#x27;s left-hand exit to Plains Road, so the Toronto-bound carriageway could be shifted next to the Niagara-bound carriageway where the opposing directions would be separated by a concrete median barrier and high mast lighting. This complemented the replacement of the existing railway grade separation (where each carriageway had its own underpass in order to accommodate the Plains Road off-ramp) with a new single structure wide enough to accommodate both directions of the expanded freeway. Plains Road was redirected to the existing service road (Queensway Drive/Harvester Road) that meets Guelph Line at an intersection just south of Guelph Line&#x27;s interchange with the QEW. The interchange with Guelph Line (originally a full cloverleaf when built, with the northern half modified to a diamond in the mid-1960s) was reconfigured to modern Parlo A4 that exclusively served QEW traffic after the ramps to Plains Road were removed, which was completed in 2006.

Starting in 2007, the highway was widened to permit an additional HOV lane in either direction between Guelph Line and Trafalgar Road, which involved twinning the Bronte Creek and Sixteen Mile Creek Bridges following by rehabilitating the original structures.
These lanes were opened to traffic on November 29, 2010.

Work began in 2005 to widen the QEW from four to six lanes through St. Catharines from Highway 406 to the Garden City Skyway.
This segment whose original design dated back to 1939, saw several interchanges improved and numerous structures replaced, although the widened Henley Bridge kept its classic architecture while existing service roads and local properties beside the freeway were largely retained. Work was completed on August 26, 2011, at a cost of $186 million.
In the late 2000s, for the section between the Freeman Interchange to North Shore Boulevard, an additional lane was added for Niagara-bound traffic, while the widening of the structure crossing Fairview Street/Plains Road enabled the loop ramp from Fairview Street to be reinstated; this onramp was originally opened in 1985 and closed off in 2001 when Highway 407 ETR opened after concerns from the city over cyclists&#x27; safety. As part of the future widening of the QEW, the existing cast-in-place concrete bridges for the North Shore Boulevard underpass were joined by two precast box girder structures on either side in 2021.
In Oakville, improvements are being made to the Highway 403/QEW/Ford Drive interchange. Since 2017, traffic using the existing loop ramp in the NE corner to access Highway 403/QEW was directed onto a new overpass instead of sharing the existing overpass with westbound Highway 403 traffic. From November 2016 to 2020, the 1970s-era bridges carrying QEW traffic across Ford Drive and the eastbound ramp to Highway 403 were demolished and replaced by new wider structures which can accommodate future HOV lanes and high-mast lighting. At the present Highway 403 only connects to the QEW west of the interchange, but a new set of flyover ramps are being proposed from Highway 403 to the QEW east of that junction using the existing right-of-way which would allow for a direct freeway connection from Milton to south Mississauga.

There are also plans to twin the bridge spanning the Credit River in Mississauga. A second bridge will be built alongside the existing structure, which will then be repaired while traffic is shifted to the new bridge. In November 2019 the Ford government announced that the historic bridge would be demolished and replaced,
but changed course due to public opposition on December18 by restricting project bids to those that would rehabilitate the structure.

Construction of Ontario&#x27;s first diverging diamond interchange, at Glendale Avenue, began in January 2021.
The new interchange, which includes a dedicated ramp to Airport Road, opened to traffic on September26, 2022.

==Future==

A stretch of the QEW from east of Cawthra Road to the west of Etobicoke Creek is to be widened with the removal of the adjacent service roads, with the centerpiece of the project involving reconfiguring the Dixie Road interchange to a five-ramp parclo and replacing the aging Dixie Road overpass. Construction commenced in May 2022 with an anticipated completion date in July 2026.

In November 2023, the municipal and provincial governments announced a tentative deal which will see responsibility for the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway transferred to the provincial government, with the two highways to be maintained as provincial highways. For the foreseeable future, the downloaded QEW segment east of Highway 427 will remain signed as part of the Gardiner.

On December 7, 2015, Ontario&#x27;s Transportation Ministry announced it was working on a plan to create permanent high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT) on a stretch, in both ways, between Trafalgar Road in Oakville and Guelph Line in Burlington starting on September 15, 2016. This would require vehicles with a single occupant to purchase a permit for such use. (A portion of Highway 427 would also have HOT lanes.) Vehicles classified as environmentally-friendly and denoted with a green license plate would not be required to pay when using the HOT lanes. Prices for the permits had not yet been determined for this plan, described as a pilot project, said Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca during a press conference.

== Exit list ==
The following table lists the exits along the QEW. Exits are numbered from Fort Erie to Toronto.

























== In popular culture ==
As the principal travel route between Toronto and Buffalo, whenever sports teams from the two cities face each other (particularly the Sabres and Maple Leafs in the National Hockey League) the game is called The Battle of the QEW. This name has also been used to describe CFL games between longtime arch-rivals the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

<text>The Classic Car Club of America (CCCA) is an organization founded in 1952 with a goal of celebrating the automobiles of the prewar period. At the time, the vehicles covered by the club were considered too modern to be of any interest by such organizations as the Antique Automobile Club of America.

Currently, the CCCA membership vehicles are among the most valuable on the market.

==Definition of a Classic car==
In the words of the CCCA:

:&quot;The Classic Car Club of America defines a Full Classic as a “Fine” or “Distinctive” automobile. American or foreign built, produced only between 1915 and 1948. Many factors come into play but, generally, a Classic was a high-priced, top end vehicle when new and was built in limited quantities. No &quot;Mass produced&quot; assembly line vehicles are considered Classics.  Other factors, including higher engine displacement, custom bespoke coachwork and luxury accessories. Mechanical developments such as power brakes, power clutch, and “one-shot” or automatic lubrication systems, help determine whether a car is considered to be a Classic.&quot;

The CCCA is considered to have invented the term classic car, which was coined to describe the vehicles covered by the club&#x27;s interest. While the term is nowadays used to describe any interesting old vehicle, many in the US consider it only properly used to describe vehicles considered eligible for the CCCA. This may be considered analogously to the correct usage of &#x27;Classical music&#x27; to mean only from a specific historical period, even though many people use the term to mean any orchestral work.

However, Los Angeles car buff and attorney Robert Gottlieb coined the term &quot;classic car&quot; in his 1951 Motor Trend columns, for the cars many people considered white elephants, then languishing on the back rows of used car lots in any city. Today, excluding &quot;associate members,&quot; aka wives, the CCCA has only 2,500 members, about its membership in the 1970s.

In order to avoid ambiguity, the CCCA generally refers to classic cars that are eligible for the CCCA &#x27;CCCA Full Classics&#x27;, &#x27;CCCA Classics&#x27;, &#x27;Full Classics&#x27;, or just capitalizes them as &#x27;Classics&#x27;.

The CCCA has a narrow focus, tending towards only the high-priced cars available in a limited time period. Racing cars and serious sports cars are not covered by the CCCA, either.

== Eligible vehicles ==

The Classic Car Club of America publishes an officially sanctioned list of makes and models: Approved CCCA Classic Cars. Some makes that are not very well represented in the club are accepted on a &quot;Considered by application&quot; basis. A Club member may petition to have a vehicle not listed in the Approved CCCA Classic Cars list approval and accepted. Such approval may be given if the car is one of a similar standard to vehicles already accepted into the club.

However, the CCCA&#x27;s list of &quot;Classics&quot; is arbitrary, accepting all eight-cylinder Auburns, an assembled Buick/Hudson product, but not the non-Imperial Chrysler eights of the same era, which also featured full-pressure-oiled engines, hydraulic brakes, and overdrive beginning before the rest of the industry in 1934, and were arguably as attractive as the Auburn pre-Airflow models. Nonetheless, the Club deserves kudos for standing firm and refusing to include post-1948 automobiles, despite persistent demand from owners of newer automobiles seeking to bolster their nests with the imprimatur of the &quot;Classic&quot; moniker.

Cars manufactured prior to 1915 may be approved if they are nearly equivalent or basically identical to eligible vehicles manufactured in 1915 or later. Cars built after 1942 and up to 1948 are only accepted if they are nearly identical or fundamentally identical to prewar vehicles; while the club&#x27;s emphasis is on pre-war vehicles, this acknowledges that many cars built immediately post-war were in fact identical to those available immediately before hostilities began.

On its website, the Classic Car Club of America maintains a list of Approved CCCA Classic Cars that are acknowledged CCCA Classics.

== Grand Classics ==
The CCCA&#x27;s car shows and judged championships are known as &quot;Grand Classics&quot; and are held at various points throughout the US. About a half-dozen Grand Classics are held annually. While neither as large nor as glamorous as the largest &quot;Concours d&#x27;Elegance&quot; such as Pebble Beach they are prestigious events in their own right.

While many cars go to be entered into the competition, the Club encourages its members to bring their cars even if they are in no condition to win at the show.

Concours judging is based on a comparison of the car to its condition when new. If the car now is identical to its as-new condition (or indeed better, given the quality of modern restoration) then 100 points are awarded. These days, quite a few vehicles rate 100 points at the show.

Some alterations for safety purposes are permitted and do not cost judging points. Glass must be safety glass except in classes purely for unrestored, as-original cars. Many original vehicles from early in the period had only one tail light and stop light; fitting a second one is accepted as long as it looks period correct. Equipping a car built with only brakes on two wheels with brakes on the other two wheels is also permitted, as long it is done in keeping with the car&#x27;s period.

== Caravans ==
The CCCA organizes annual driving tours under this name. Distances covered are often scenic and leisurely, with many stops at local attractions. These events could be as long as several weeks, or as short as 3 days depending on the focus of the tour.

<doc id="312648" wikidata="Q2625281" url="?curid=312648" title="Mutual exclusivity">
<text>In logic and probability theory, two events (or propositions) are mutually exclusive or disjoint if they cannot both occur at the same time. A clear example is the set of outcomes of a single coin toss, which can result in either heads or tails, but not both.

In the coin-tossing example, both outcomes are, in theory, collectively exhaustive, which means that at least one of the outcomes must happen, so these two possibilities together exhaust all the possibilities. However, not all mutually exclusive events are collectively exhaustive. For example, the outcomes 1 and 4 of a single roll of a six-sided die are mutually exclusive (both cannot happen at the same time) but not collectively exhaustive (there are other possible outcomes; 2,3,5,6).

==Logic==

In logic, two propositions formula_1 and formula_2 are mutually exclusive if it is not logically possible for them to be true at the same time; that is, formula_3 is a tautology. To say that more than two propositions are mutually exclusive, depending on the context, means either 1. &quot;formula_4 is a tautology&quot; (it is not logically possible for more than one proposition to be true) or 2. &quot;formula_5 is a tautology&quot; (it is not logically possible for all propositions to be true at the same time). The term &quot;pairwise mutually exclusive&quot; always means the former.

==Probability==
In probability theory, events &quot;E&quot;1, &quot;E&quot;2, ..., &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of any one of them implies the non-occurrence of the remaining &quot;n&quot; − 1 events. Therefore, two mutually exclusive events cannot both occur. Formally said, formula_6 is a set of mutually exclusive events if and only if given any formula_7, if formula_8 then formula_9. As a consequence, mutually exclusive events have the property: formula_10.

For example, in a standard 52-card deck with two colors it is impossible to draw a card that is both red and a club because clubs are always black. If just one card is drawn from the deck, either a red card (heart or diamond) or a black card (club or spade) will be drawn. When &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are mutually exclusive, . To find the probability of drawing a red card or a club, for example, add together the probability of drawing a red card and the probability of drawing a club. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and thirteen clubs: 26/52 + 13/52 = 39/52 or 3/4.

One would have to draw at least two cards in order to draw both a red card and a club. The probability of doing so in two draws depends on whether the first card drawn was replaced before the second drawing since without replacement there is one fewer card after the first card was drawn. The probabilities of the individual events (red, and club) are multiplied rather than added. The probability of drawing a red and a club in two drawings without replacement is then , or 13/51. With replacement, the probability would be , or 13/52.

In probability theory, the word &quot;or&quot; allows for the possibility of both events happening. The probability of one or both events occurring is denoted P(&quot;A&quot; ∪ &quot;B&quot;) and in general, it equals P(&quot;A&quot;) + P(&quot;B&quot;) – P(&quot;A&quot; ∩ &quot;B&quot;). Therefore, in the case of drawing a red card or a king, drawing any of a red king, a red non-king, or a black king is considered a success. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and four kings, two of which are red, so the probability of drawing a red or a king is 26/52 + 4/52 – 2/52 = 28/52.

Events are collectively exhaustive if all the possibilities for outcomes are exhausted by those possible events, so at least one of those outcomes must occur. The probability that at least one of the events will occur is equal to one. For example, there are theoretically only two possibilities for flipping a coin. Flipping a head and flipping a tail are collectively exhaustive events, and there is a probability of one of flipping either a head or a tail. Events can be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In the case of flipping a coin, flipping a head and flipping a tail are also mutually exclusive events. Both outcomes cannot occur for a single trial (i.e., when a coin is flipped only once). The probability of flipping a head and the probability of flipping a tail can be added to yield a probability of 1: 1/2 + 1/2 =1.

==Statistics==
In statistics and regression analysis, an independent variable that can take on only two possible values is called a dummy variable. For example, it may take on the value 0 if an observation is of a white subject or 1 if the observation is of a black subject. The two possible categories associated with the two possible values are mutually exclusive, so that no observation falls into more than one category, and the categories are exhaustive, so that every observation falls into some category. Sometimes there are three or more possible categories, which are pairwise mutually exclusive and are collectively exhaustive — for example, under 18 years of age, 18 to 64 years of age, and age 65 or above. In this case a set of dummy variables is constructed, each dummy variable having two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive categories — in this example, one dummy variable (called D1) would equal 1 if age is less than 18, and would equal 0 &quot;otherwise&quot;; a second dummy variable (called D2) would equal 1 if age is in the range 18–64, and 0 otherwise. In this set-up, the dummy variable pairs (D1, D2) can have the values (1,0) (under 18), (0,1) (between 18 and 64), or (0,0) (65 or older) (but not (1,1), which would nonsensically imply that an observed subject is both under 18 and between 18 and 64). Then the dummy variables can be included as independent (explanatory) variables in a regression. The number of dummy variables is always one less than the number of categories: with the two categories black and white there is a single dummy variable to distinguish them, while with the three age categories two dummy variables are needed to distinguish them.

Such qualitative data can also be used for dependent variables. For example, a researcher might want to predict whether someone gets arrested or not, using family income or race, as explanatory variables. Here the variable to be explained is a dummy variable that equals 0 if the observed subject does not get arrested and equals 1 if the subject does get arrested. In such a situation, ordinary least squares (the basic regression technique) is widely seen as inadequate; instead probit regression or logistic regression is used. Further, sometimes there are three or more categories for the dependent variable — for example, no charges, charges, and death sentences. In this case, the multinomial probit or multinomial logit technique is used.

<text>Richard Wawro (14 April 1952 – 22 February 2006) was a Scottish artist notable for his landscapes in wax oil crayon. He was an autistic savant.

==Life==
Wawro was the son of Tadeusz and Olive Wawro; his father was a Polish military officer and civil engineer who had settled as a librarian in Fife, Scotland and his mother a Scottish primary schoolteacher. He was diagnosed as &quot;moderately to severely retarded&quot; at the age of three, a condition later recognised as autism. He did not learn to speak before the age of 11 and required eye surgery to remove cataracts, which left him with sufficiently poor eyesight to be classed as legally blind.

As a toddler, Wawro began to draw on a chalkboard. At the age of six, his mother brought him to Molly Leishman, in the local children&#x27;s centre, a special needs teacher who noticed his fascination with light and reflections. She introduced him to wax crayons, the medium in which he would work in for the rest of his life. Initially, his drawings were simple scribbles, much like those of his peers. But soon his scribbles began to evolve into recognisable images, with an unexpected level of detail and sophistication. His talent was recognised soon after. Professor Marian Bohusz-Szyszko of the Polish School of Art, London, said he was &quot;thunderstruck&quot; at Wawro&#x27;s drawings, describing them as &quot;an incredible phenomenon rendered with the precision of a mechanic and the vision of a poet&quot;.

In 1970 the Edinburgh impresario Richard Demarco &quot;discovered&quot; Wawro, then aged 17, and exhibited his works in his gallery. His story was presented on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Nationwide&quot; programme. The report was shown a second time as one of the programme&#x27;s highlights of that year. In the early 1970s one of his London exhibitions was opened by Margaret Thatcher, then Education Minister, who bought several of his pictures, as did John Paul II.

He got his father&#x27;s approval for each picture until his father died in 2002. Overall he sold more than 1,000 pictures in around 100 exhibitions.

His original art was first introduced in the United States in 1977 at a National Council of Teachers of English conference on Creativity for the Gifted and Talented in New York City. In 1983 his life and work were the subject of a documentary film, &quot;With Eyes Wide Open&quot;, by the autism expert Laurence A. Becker, Ph.D. who also produced a video profile of him, &quot;A Real Rainman&quot;.

Wawro died in Edinburgh of lung cancer on 22 February 2006.

==Works==
Wawro worked in the unusual medium of wax oil crayon, specialising in landscapes and seascapes that were acclaimed for their highly detailed and dramatic images of intense depth and colour. He used no models, but drew from images seen only once, such as in books or on television; his phenomenal memory enabled him to recall where he drew each picture and to date it precisely in his mind. Although possessing perfect recall, he often added his own touches to the images. He was particularly inspired by light, and the tones he used to capture light and shadows are considered masterly.

A collection of nine of Wawro&#x27;s drawings was featured on an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, filmed at Thirlestane Castle and broadcast on 22 September 2024. Wawro&#x27;s brother gave some biographical information.

<doc id="312661" wikidata="Q278043" url="?curid=312661" title="Fremantle Football Club">
<text>The Fremantle Football Club, nicknamed the Dockers or colloquially Freo, is a professional Australian rules football club competing in the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport&#x27;s elite competition. The team was founded in 1994 to represent the port city of Fremantle, a stronghold of Australian rules football in Western Australia. The Dockers were the second team from the state to be admitted to the competition, following the West Coast Eagles in 1987. Both Fremantle and the West Coast Eagles are owned by the West Australian Football Commission (WAFC), with a board of directors operating Fremantle on the commission&#x27;s behalf.

Despite having participated in and won several finals matches, Fremantle is one of only three active AFL clubs not to have won a premiership (the others being and ), though it did claim a minor premiership in 2015 and reached the 2013 Grand Final, losing to . High-profile players who forged careers at Fremantle include All-Australian Matthew Pavlich, Hall of Fame inductee Peter Bell, and dual Brownlow Medal winner Nat Fyfe, who previously captained the club under both Ross Lyon and current head coach Justin Longmuir. Originally based at Fremantle Oval, the club&#x27;s training and administrative facilities are now located nearby at Cockburn ARC in Cockburn Central, whilst its home ground is the 60,000-capacity Perth Stadium in Burswood. 
Fremantle has also fielded a women&#x27;s team in the AFL Women&#x27;s league since the competition&#x27;s inception in 2017. They are currently coached by Lisa Webb and captained by Angelique Stannett. Their most successful season was the 2020 season, in which the team was undefeated, but was ultimately cancelled without a premiership awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Australian rules football in Fremantle==
The port city of Fremantle, Western Australia has a rich footballing history, hosting the state&#x27;s first organised game of Australian rules in 1881. Fremantle&#x27;s first teams, the Fremantle Football Club, the Union/Fremantle Football Club and East Fremantle Football Club, dominated the early years of the West Australian Football League (WAFL), winning 24 of the first 34 premierships. Since 1897, Fremantle Oval has been the main venue for Australian rules football matches in the city. Until the opening of Perth Stadium in 2018, the record attendance for an Australian rules football game in Western Australia stood at 52,781 for the 1979 WANFL Grand Final between East Fremantle and South Fremantle at Subiaco Oval.

Champion footballers who forged careers playing for Fremantle-based clubs include, among other Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees, Steve Marsh, Jack Sheedy, John Todd, George Doig, William Truscott and Bernie Naylor.

== History ==

===Early years (1993–2006)===
Despite the long history of Australian rules football in Fremantle, the expansion of the then-Victorian Football League into Western Australia, took the form of a state-wide club, with the creation of the West Coast Eagles, in 1987. Soon afterwards, there were negotiations between WAFL clubs East Fremantle and South Fremantle, regarding formation of a second WA-based VFL club, as a joint venture. Due to exclusive rights clauses in contracts between the West Coast Eagles and the VFL, a second WA franchise was not legally possible until after the 1992 season. Moreover, the model of a joint venture between two WAFL clubs was opposed by the West Australian Football Commission (WAFC).

On 14 December 1993, the AFL announced that a new team, to be based in Fremantle, would enter the league in 1995, with the provisional name &quot;Fremantle Sharks.&quot; The licence had cost the WAFC $4 million. On 21 July 1994, the names &quot;Fremantle Football Club&quot;, &quot;Fremantle Dockers&quot; and the club colours of purple, red, green and white were announced.

A first training session for the inaugural squad was held on 31 October 1994 at Fremantle Oval.

The team endured some tough years near the bottom of the premiership ladder, until they finished fifth after the home and away rounds in 2003 and made the finals for the first time. The elimination final against eighth-placed Essendon at Subiaco Oval was then the club&#x27;s biggest ever game, but ended in disappointment for the home team, with the finals experience of Essendon proving too strong for the young team. They then missed making the finals in the following two seasons, finishing both years with 11 wins, 11 losses and only 1 game outside the top eight.

After an average first half to the 2006 AFL season, Fremantle finished the year with a club-record nine straight wins to earn themselves third position at the end of the home and away season with a club-best 15 wins. In the qualifying final against Adelaide at AAMI Stadium, the Dockers led for the first three-quarters before being overrun by the Crows. The following week saw the club win its first finals game in the semi-final against Melbourne at Subiaco Oval. The club subsequently earned a trip to Sydney to play in its first ever preliminary final, where they lost by 35 points at ANZ Stadium to the Sydney Swans.

===Recent history (2007–present)===
In 2007, following Chris Connolly&#x27;s resignation midway through the season, Mark Harvey, a three-time premiership player with Essendon, was appointed caretaker coach for the club. During his seven matches for 2007, Harvey coached the Dockers to four wins and three losses. The club came 11th that year, and Harvey was appointed full-time coach at the end of the season. The following year saw the club slump to 14th.

In Round 15, 2009, Fremantle recorded the lowest score in its history and of the 2000s, scoring only 1.7 (13) to the Adelaide Crows&#x27; 19.16 (130). It scored just one point in the first half and the only goal scored came in the third quarter.

After finishing sixth in 2010, the club played in the finals for the first time since 2006. The team played Hawthorn at Subiaco Oval, and despite being considered underdogs, went on to win by 30 points. The win came from strong performances from Luke McPharlin and Adam McPhee who limited the impact of Lance Franklin and Luke Hodge, respectively. The team&#x27;s second ever win in a finals match qualified them for a semi-final to be played against the Geelong Cats at the MCG the following week. In a one-sided contest, the Dockers lost by 69 points.

The 2011 season saw Fremantle lose just once in the first six rounds before ending the year in 11th position after losing their final seven games. Fremantle&#x27;s collapse was considered a result of a heavy injury count that began in the pre-season.

In September 2011, Mark Harvey was sensationally sacked by the club in favour of still-contracted St Kilda coach Ross Lyon.

Fremantle qualified for the finals in 2012 after finishing in seventh position. In their elimination final against Geelong, the Dockers won their first ever finals game away from home with a 16-point victory at the MCG behind Matthew Pavlich&#x27;s six goals. Fremantle subsequently lost to the Crows in Adelaide the following week, ending their finals campaign.

In 2013, Fremantle finished the home-and-away season in third position with a club-best 16 wins. In their qualifying final against the Cats in Geelong, the Dockers produced a first-round upset with a 15-point victory to advance through to a home preliminary final. In the preliminary final, the Dockers defeated the reigning premiers, the Sydney Swans, by 25 points to advance to their maiden AFL Grand Final. In the 2013 grand final, the Dockers were defeated by Hawthorn by a margin of 15 points.

In 2014, the club reached the finals for the third successive year with a top-four finish and 16 wins, but despite earning a double chance, they were knocked out after losses to Sydney away and Port Adelaide at home. Nat Fyfe was awarded the Leigh Matthews Trophy for winning the AFL Players&#x27; Association MVP award.

In 2015, the club were crowned minor premiers for the first time in their history, earning their first piece of silverware with the McClelland Trophy. However, the club failed to convert this into a grand final appearance, losing to Hawthorn by 27 points in its home preliminary final. Fremantle ended their season with Nat Fyfe becoming the club&#x27;s first Brownlow Medalist.

Season 2016 marked Matthew Pavlich&#x27;s final season in the AFL, as Fremantle missed the finals following a 10-game losing streak to start the year, finishing in 16th position with just four wins.

Ross Lyon was sacked as coach on 20 August 2019 after the club failed to qualify for the finals. He was replaced by Justin Longmuir.

Longmuir&#x27;s first season was during the COVID-19-affected 2020 AFL season, which was shortened from 22 matches to 17. Fremantle would lose their first four games before finding form and finishing 12th on the ladder with 7 wins and 10 losses.

The 2022 AFL season would prove to be a breakout year for the Dockers, who qualified for finals for the first time since the 2015 AFL season and were in contention for a top-4 finish throughout the season before finishing fifth with fifteen wins, six losses, and one draw. Fremantle&#x27;s return to finals saw them play the Western Bulldogs in an elimination final at Optus Stadium. Fremantle were dominated in the early stages of the game, with the Bulldogs holding a 42–1 lead at the nine-minute mark of the second term. Fremantle would go on to kick 11 of the last 13 goals to win the game by 13 points. Fremantle next faced Collingwood in a semi-final at the MCG in front of a crowd of over 90,000, losing the game by 20 points.

After losing their opening 2 games of the 2023 AFL season, Fremantle recorded their first win in the 56th Western Derby, beating the Eagles by 41 points. Despite a mid-season resurgence, beating both 2022 Grand Finalists in consecutive weeks, the Dockers would fade out to finish 14th on the ladder.

Fremantle had a promising start to the 2024 AFL season, winning their first three games, before two close losses in Adelaide and a shock loss in Western Derby 58 surrounded their season with uncertainty. The Dockers rebounded, losing just one of their next six games before the mid-season bye to sit inside the top eight. They were entrenched inside the top eight for much of the year and were in the top four as late as round 20, before losing their final four matches. This was catalysed by injuries to key position players, including captain Alex Pearce, leading goalkicker Josh Treacy, and starting ruckman Sean Darcy. The Dockers finished 10th with a record of 12 wins, 10 losses and one draw, just half a win behind Carlton in eighth place.

==Performance==
After struggling in their early start-up years, Fremantle have continued to struggle over the years, with an overall win percentage of 45.52% as of July 2024, ranked 16th out of the 21 teams to have ever played in the VFL/AFL league. Because of this unimpressive win record, they are yet to win a premiership. This fact has earned them the nickname &quot;Flagmantle&quot;, which is an optimistic joke used by fans. The Dockers&#x27; halcyon years took place between 2013 and 2015, where they earned three successive top-four finishes to go with their only grand final appearance (2013) and their only minor premiership (2015).

Fremantle played its first drawn match in Round 8, 2013, against the Sydney Swans. In 2006, against St Kilda at Aurora Stadium in Launceston, they played in a controversial Round 5 match (dubbed &quot;Sirengate&quot;) that initially ended in a draw. However, the AFL overturned the draw result the following Wednesday after the match; the controversy was due to an off-field error made by the timekeepers not sounding the siren for long enough to confirm that the umpires heard it, as well as the siren not being loud enough for the field umpires to hear over the roar of the crowd in the first place, and Fremantle were eventually declared as one-point winners with no protest from St Kilda. It marked the first time a game result had later been overturned since 1900.

===AFL H&amp;A finishing positions (1995–present)===
==Club identity==
=== Nickname ===

The club is nicknamed the &quot;Dockers&quot; in reference to Fremantle&#x27;s history as a port city. Shortly after the club was launched in 1994, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., which produces the Dockers brand of clothing, challenged the club&#x27;s right to use the name &quot;Fremantle Dockers&quot;, specifically on clothing. As a result, the club and the AFL discontinued the official use of the &quot;Dockers&quot; nickname in 1997. However, it remained in common usage both inside and outside the club, and continued to appear in the official team song &quot;Freo Way to Go&quot; and as the title of the official club magazine &quot;Docker&quot;. In October 2010, the strong association that members and fans have with the &quot;Dockers&quot; nickname led the club to form a new arrangement with Levi Strauss &amp; Co which allows the club to officially use the nickname &quot;Dockers&quot; everywhere including on clothing and other brand elements. This name change was made in conjunction with changes to the club logo and playing strip.

=== Guernsey ===

Until 2011 the Fremantle Football Club used the anchor symbol as the basis for all of their guernseys. The home guernsey was purple, with a white anchor on the front separating the chest area into red and green panels, representing the traditional maritime port and starboard colours. The colours also acknowledged Fremantle&#x27;s large Italian community, which historically has been associated with the city&#x27;s fishing community. The away or clash guernsey was all white with a purple anchor. Since the end of the 2010 home and away season, the home jumper is purple with three white chevrons, and the away jumper is white with purple chevrons.

One game each year is designated as the &quot;Purple Haze&quot; game, where an all-purple jumper with a white anchor is worn. This game is used to raise money for the Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation. After the guernsey re-design to a predominately purple home jumper, Fremantle wore the Starlight Foundation logo, a yellow star, above the highest chevron for their Purple Haze game.

Since 2003, the AFL has hosted an annual Heritage Round. Until 2006, Fremantle wore a white guernsey with three red chevrons, to emulate the jumper worn by the original Fremantle Football Club in 1885. However, in 2007, the selected round had Fremantle playing Sydney, who also wear red and white. An alternative blue and white striped design was used, based on the jumper worn by the East Fremantle Football Club in their 1979 WAFL Grand Final win over the South Fremantle Football Club. This &quot;Fremantle Derby&quot; held the record, prior to the opening of Optus Stadium, for the highest attendance at a football game of any code in Western Australia, with 52,781 attending at Subiaco Oval.

In September 2008, newly appointed CEO Steve Rosich confirmed that the Fremantle Football Club would undergo a thorough review of all areas, including the club&#x27;s team name, song, guernsey, and logo in a bid to boost its marketability. However he later confirmed that the purple colour will be maintained as it had become synonymous with Fremantle.

=== Home ground and headquarters ===

Fremantle Football Club had its original training and administration facilities at Fremantle Oval from 1995 until 2017. On 21 February 2017 the club moved its training and administration facilities to Cockburn ARC, a professional sports training facility and community recreation centre that was constructed in 2015–17 at a price of $109 million, located in the suburb of Cockburn Central.

The team&#x27;s home games are played at Optus Stadium, a 61,000 seat multi-purpose stadium located in the suburb of Burswood. The club began playing home matches at the venue in 2018, having previously played home matches at Subiaco Oval from 2001 onward and before that the WACA Ground from 1995 to 2000.

=== Songs ===
The official song of Fremantle is &quot;Freo Way to Go&quot;, a truncated version of the club&#x27;s original song, &quot;Freo Heave Ho&quot;, written by Ken Walther. &quot;Freo Way to Go&quot; was adopted in 2011 following a poll on the Dockers&#x27; official website, beating out three other newly composed songs, including &quot;Freo Freo&quot;, which was written by Fremantle-based indie rock group and the Dockers&#x27; then-number one ticket holder, Eskimo Joe. The poll took place around the same time that the club&#x27;s guernsey and logo were also updated.

Unlike other AFL team songs, &quot;Freo Way to Go&quot; is played to a contemporary rock tune. &quot;Freo Heave Ho&quot; also had a section based on Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s arrangement of the traditional Russian folk song, &quot;Song of the Volga Boatmen&quot;, which was dropped in 2011, leaving only the original composition of Walther.

Due to its unconventional style, the song is derided by many opposition supporters and defended with equally fierce loyalty by many fans. &quot;Every other team song sounds like a &#x27;Knees Up Mother Brown&#x27; from previous eras. We&#x27;ve got a backbeat&quot;, boasted author and Fremantle fan Tim Winton. In 2021, in response to being named the club&#x27;s new number one ticket holder, Tame Impala frontman and Fremantle local Kevin Parker released a new Fremantle &quot;pump-up&quot; track to be played at home games. Bolstering the Fremantle connection, the song draws inspiration from AC/DC.

=== Mascots ===

*1995–1999: &quot;Grinder&quot; – A cartoon-like docker man, in a similar style to Popeye, with a permanent snarl, oversized jaw and muscular arms.
*2000–2003: &quot;The Doc&quot; – a straggly blonde-haired mascot, similar in appearance to Fremantle players Clive Waterhouse or Shaun McManus.
*2003–present: &quot;Johnny &quot;The Doc&quot; Docker&quot; – a blonde haired surfer with a surfboard under one arm is the Dockers&#x27; official mascot in the Mascot Manor promotion for kids. Jenny Docker is also a mascot of the Fremantle Football Club.

===Ownership and management===
The club is owned by the West Australian Football Commission (WAFC). Since 2003, a board of directors controls the operation of the club, on behalf of the WAFC. Prior to this, a two-tier arrangement was in place, with a Board of Management between the board of directors and the commission. The initial club chief executive officer was David Hatt, who had come from a hockey background, and the inaugural club chairman was Ross Kelly, who had played for West Perth. It was a deliberate act by the commission to avoid having administrators from either East Fremantle or South Fremantle in key roles, as they wanted the club to be bigger than just representing Fremantle.
Kelly resigned at the end of 1998, replaced by Ross McLean. Whilst he presided over some key financial decisions, including the building of the club&#x27;s administrative and training centre at Fremantle Oval and the deferment of the licence fee to the AFL, it was Fremantle&#x27;s lowest point onfield, culminating in a two-win season in 2001 which saw the coach Damian Drum be sacked mid-year. McLean resigned following an inadvertent breach of the salary cap.

In early 2001 Hatt accepted a government job and Cameron Schwab was appointed. After weathering the fallout from the disastrous 2001 season, Schwab and the new chairman, local West Australian retailing businessman Rick Hart, set about rebuilding the club. A former recruiting manager, Schwab focused on building up the on-field performance by recruiting high-profile players in Trent Croad, Peter Bell and Jeff Farmer, as well as coach Chris Connolly and with Hart then focused on enhancing the corporate and financial standing of the club. The club membership grew every year from 2002 until 2008 and the final licence payment was made to the AFL in 2005.

Schwab chose to return to Melbourne in 2008 and was replaced as CEO by Steve Rosich, who had previously worked for the West Coast Eagles. A year later Hart resigned as president and Steve Harris, who runs The Brand Agency and had produced advertising for Fremantle since 2002, took over at the end of 2009. Harris had been on the board since November 2008, the first club chairman or president to have previously served on the board. The club has developed into one of the wealthiest clubs in the league and their surprise recruitment of Ross Lyon to replace Mark Harvey as coach at the end of the 2011 is seen as an example of their ruthless drive for sustained success. In 2014, Harris resigned as president and was replaced by the then vice president, Perth property developer Dale Alcock.

===Rivalries===
====Western Derby====
Fremantle&#x27;s biggest rivalry is with the other Western Australian team, the West Coast Eagles, who they play twice each year in the home and away season, in the fiercely contested &quot;Western Derby&quot; matches (Pronounced in Western Australia). West Coast were victorious in the first nine games, before Fremantle won in round 16, 1999, after which has prompted a fairly even Derby result with Fremantle at 25 and West Coast at 24 Derby wins. The term &quot;derby&quot; is named after the Fremantle Derby games between East and South Fremantle in the West Australian Football League, which for almost 100 years have been considered some of the most important games in the local league. The 1979 WANFL Grand Final holds the football attendance record for the now-closed Subiaco Oval of 52,781.

====St Kilda controversies====
The Dockers and the St Kilda Football Club have seen a number of controversial events between them, most notably the AFL siren controversy at York Park in 2006. The match was sent into a state of confusion with Fremantle leading by one point when the siren (which had not been very loud all game) was not heard by the umpires who then allowed St Kilda tagger Steven Baker to score a point after time had elapsed and, as a result, the match ended in a draw. The outcome of the game was taken to the AFL Commission and it was decided during the week that as the siren had gone Fremantle were judged to be the winners, disallowing Baker&#x27;s point.

During the 2011 off-season, Fremantle sacked coach Mark Harvey and replaced him with then-St Kilda coach Ross Lyon in controversial circumstances. The move was met with much criticism towards Fremantle&#x27;s president, Steve Harris, and CEO, Steve Rosich, claiming that they had &quot;backstabbed&quot; Harvey. Lyon was also met with widespread criticism and was accused of backstabbing St Kilda by many Saints supporters as the club was made aware that Fremantle had approached Lyon during St Kilda&#x27;s lead-up to its finals campaign. The two clubs contested a highly anticipated Friday night match in Round 4 of the 2012 AFL season at Etihad Stadium, with Fremantle winning by 13 points and Lyon being booed throughout the match. Lyon became Fremantle&#x27;s longest serving and most successful coach before being sacked in 2019. He later returned for a second coaching stint at St Kilda in 2023, and his first game back was against Fremantle.

===Leadership (Captain/Coach)===

=== Reserves team ===
For most of Fremantle&#x27;s history, players have played for various West Australian Football League (WAFL) teams when not selected to play for the Fremantle AFL team. Players recruited from the WAFL have remained with their original club, and players recruited from interstate have been allocated to teams via a draft system. Since the 2014 season, the Peel Thunder Football Club has served as the host club for the Fremantle Dockers, an arrangement which will see Fremantle&#x27;s reserves players playing in the WAFL for Peel Thunder Football Club. An attempt to field a standalone Fremantle reserves side in the WAFL was rejected by the other WAFL clubs. A similar host club system was used in 1999 when South Fremantle was the aligned club but was cancelled after a single season.

===History===

In May 2016, the club launched a bid to enter a team in the inaugural AFL Women&#x27;s season in 2017. As part of the bid, the team would guarantee all players education and job opportunities with the club and the partnering Curtin University.

Fremantle beat out a bid from rivals when they were granted a license on 15 June 2016.

Kiara Bowers and Kara Antonio were the club&#x27;s first signings, unveiled along with the league&#x27;s other 14 marquee players on 27 July 2016. A further 24 senior players and two rookie players were added to the club&#x27;s inaugural list in the league&#x27;s drafting and signing period.

Former South Fremantle assistant coach, Michelle Cowan was appointed the team&#x27;s inaugural head coach in July 2016.

The club&#x27;s initial bid outlined plans for a game each at Domain Stadium and at Curtin University&#x27;s Bentley campus as well as up to two remaining matches held at the club training base in the city of Cockburn. The club eventually played two home games at Fremantle Oval, one at Domain Stadium and one in Mandurah. In 2018, the Dockers hosted the first football game at Perth Stadium but played the remainder of their home games at Fremantle Oval.

The Dockers struggled in their inaugural season, only winning one of seven games and finishing seventh out of eight teams on the ladder. They fared slightly better in 2018, winning three matches, but again finished seventh on the ladder.

In 2019, Fremantle had their most successful season, losing only one game during the home-and-away matches (to eventual premiers Adelaide) and making the finals for the first time. The team, now coached by Trent Cooper and with Kiara Bowers making her long-awaited debut after two injury-affected years, started the year with a high-scoring victory over Melbourne in the opening round and then kicked their highest ever score, 10.7 (67), in round 2 against Brisbane. Despite having won two more games than Carlton, the controversial conference system saw Carlton host the knock out preliminary final and inflict Fremantle&#x27;s second defeat of the year. In the post-season awards, Bowers and Dana Hooker came second behind Erin Phillips in the AFLW MVP award and AFL Women&#x27;s best and fairest award, respectively. Bowers, Hooker and Gemma Houghton were all named in the AFL Women&#x27;s All-Australian team. Ashley Sharp was awarded goal of the year for a long-run, multiple-bounce goal.

==Awards==
The Doig Medal is the Fremantle Football Club&#x27;s annual fairest and best award. Currently, the Fremantle coaching staff give every player votes on a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 basis after every match, including Finals Series matches. Top votes are awarded for what is regarded as an elite performance. At the end of the year the votes are tallied and the Doig Medal Night is held to announce the winner. Variations on the voting system have been used in past years. The awards ceremony has been held at the Fremantle Passenger Terminal (1995), Challenge Stadium (1998–1999), Fremantle Oval (2000–2001), the Grand Ballroom at Burswood Entertainment Complex (2002–2005, 2008–current) and the Perth Convention Exhibition Centre (2006–2007).

The Beacon Award is presented to the club&#x27;s best first year player. Mature aged recruits Michael Barlow, Tendai Mzungu and Lee Spurr have won in recent years, despite being significantly older than most first year players.

===Fremantle Football Hall of Legends===
The Fremantle Football Hall of Legends was inaugurated by Fremantle Football Club in 1995, in recognition of the new AFL team&#x27;s links with its home city&#x27;s football heritage. The inductees are nominated by the two clubs from the Fremantle area in the WAFL: East Fremantle and South Fremantle. In time, players who represented Fremantle in the AFL will join their predecessors in this prestigious Hall.

===Fremantle&#x27;s 25 Since &#x27;95===
In 2019, The West Australian named Fremantle&#x27;s greatest team of the past twenty five years as part of the club&#x27;s twenty fifth anniversary celebrations, as voted by Fans and club officials.:

== Supporters ==

===Number-one ticket holders===

It is traditional for each AFL club to recognise a prominent supporter as the number-one ticket holder. Fremantle originally chose to award this to Carmen Lawrence, the sitting member for the federal seat of Fremantle. This was roundly criticised as the member may or may not be a supporter of the club and unnecessarily linked politics with sport. The policy was soon changed to select a well-known Fremantle identity for a two-year period.

On 23 April 2010, Eskimo Joe were announced as Fremantle&#x27;s number-one ticket holder, replacing golfer Nick O&#x27;Hern. The band&#x27;s drummer and guitarist, Joel Quartermain, hinted that they might write a new theme song for the club, saying that In 2011, Eskimo Joe submitted their proposed song for a fan vote, although it ultimately lost to &quot;Freo Way To Go&quot;, a variant of the club&#x27;s original song.
Other high-profile fans include former Premiers of Western Australia, Mark McGowan and Alan Carpenter, former Federal Minister of Defence, Stephen Smith, Tim Minchin, members of psychedelic rock band Tame Impala, author Tim Winton, American tennis player John Isner and journalists and television presenters Dixie Marshall, Simon Reeve, golfer Min Woo Lee, and Matt Price, who wrote a book on Fremantle, &quot;Way to Go&quot;.

=== Membership base ===

Despite a relative lack of on-field success, Fremantle has recorded membership figures above average for the league.
The club in 2004 had the fastest-growing membership in the AFL competition, at more than 27% from the previous year, with home crowds growing at a similar rate. The club&#x27;s recent membership slogans have emphasised the passion of Fremantle fans for their team.

Fremantle achieved a membership of over 60,000 in 2023, for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

===Patrons===
From 2003 until 2021, the Fremantle Football Club had the current or past Governor of Western Australia as its patron.
*2003–2005: John Sanderson
*2006–2021: Ken Michael
*2021–: Richard Walley
Vice-patrons
*David Malcolm – Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia (retired)
