<text>David Russell Lange ( ; 4 August 1942 – 13 August 2005) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 32nd prime minister of New Zealand from 1984 to 1989. A member of the New Zealand Labour Party, Lange was also the minister of Education and the minister of Foreign Affairs alongside his term as prime minister. He was also the attorney-general of New Zealand from 1989 to 1990.

Lange was born and brought up in Ōtāhuhu, the son of a physician. He became a lawyer, and represented poor and struggling people in civil rights causes in the rapidly changing Auckland of the 1970s. After serving as legal advisor to the Polynesian Panthers, Lange was first elected to the New Zealand Parliament in the Mangere by-election of 1977. He became a prominent debater within parliament, and soon gained a reputation for cutting wit (sometimes directed against himself) and eloquence. Lange became the leader of the Labour Party and leader of the Opposition in 1983, succeeding Bill Rowling.

When Prime Minister Robert Muldoon called an election for July 1984 Lange led his party to a landslide victory, becoming, at the age of 41, New Zealand&#x27;s youngest prime minister of the 20th century. Lange took various measures to deal with the economic problems he had inherited from the previous government. Some of the measures he took were controversial; the free-market ethos of the Fourth Labour Government did not always conform to traditional expectations of a social-democratic party. He also fulfilled a campaign promise to deny New Zealand&#x27;s port facilities to nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered vessels, making New Zealand a nuclear-free zone. Lange and his party were re-elected in August 1987; he resigned two years later and was succeeded by his deputy, Geoffrey Palmer. He retired from parliament in 1996, and died in 2005 from renal failure and blood disease at the age of 63. Prime Minister Helen Clark described New Zealand&#x27;s nuclear-free legislation as his legacy.

==Early life==
Lange was born on 4 August 1942 in Ōtāhuhu, a small industrial borough since absorbed into Auckland. He was the oldest of four children of Eric Roy Lange, a general practitioner and obstetrician and grandson of a German settler, and Phoebe Fysh Lange, who trained as a nurse in her native Tasmania before she migrated to New Zealand. The family had lived in New Zealand for so long that the original pronunciation of their surname, &quot;lan-ge&quot;, &quot;had all but been forgotten&quot;; Lange himself would pronounce it as &quot;long-ee&quot;. 

Lange&#x27;s autobiography suggests that he admired his soft-spoken and dryly humorous father, while his demanding and sometimes overbearing mother tested his tolerance. His cousin Michael Bassett reflected that Roy &quot;knew how to avoid trouble rather than confront it&quot;, and David developed a similar aversion to conflict.

Lange received his formal education at Fairburn Primary School, Papatoetoe Intermediate School and Otahuhu College, then at the University of Auckland in 1960, where he graduated in law in 1966. He attributed his talents with oratory to the need to compensate for his clumsiness during his intermediate school days.

Lange worked from an early age and held a number of jobs; in the third form he performed a paper-round for &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; in Mangere East, and later changed from delivery-boy to collecting the money. The following year he delivered telegrams, before applying to work at the Westfield Freezing Works in the role that would initially pay his way through university. The poor work conditions at the freezing works provided an opportunity to identify with the misery of fellow workers, and an appreciation for the impact of strikes on ordinary workers.

In 1961 he started a job as a law clerk at Haigh, Charters and Carthy, a role that had varied work and clients, including the Communist Party. On 13 March 1967 Lange was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of New Zealand. After his admission he spent months travelling across Australia, Asia and Britain. On 3 August 1968, he married Naomi Crampton. He gained a Master of Laws in 1970 with first-class honours, specialising in criminal law and medico-legal issues. Lange practised law in Northland and Auckland for some years, often giving legal representation to the most dispossessed members of Auckland society – he assisted the Polynesian Panther Party (and, by extension, the Pacific Island community) to disseminate legal rights information and legal aid during the &#x27;70s dawn raids.

In July 1976 Lange was involved in the legal defence of former cabinet minister Phil Amos after he protested the visit of the 20,000 tonne American cruiser in his small yacht the &quot;Dolphin&quot; by impeding its entry to Auckland Harbour. The cruiser was forced to stop mid-stream to allow grappling hooks to be thrown to pull the &quot;Dolphin&quot; clear. Afterwards Amos had been arrested and charged with obstruction. He was convicted, but the conviction was overturned on appeal by Lange. Amos&#x27; protest instantly became a headline-grabbing piece of political drama, bringing public attention to the anti-nuclear issue. Lange was inspired by Amos&#x27; stand and following his example would later pass a law banning the visit by nuclear propelled or armed ships to New Zealand.

==Political career==


 
Lange joined the Labour Party in 1963, and helped in the campaigns of Phil Amos in 1963 and Norman Douglas in 1966. In 1974 his cousin Michael Bassett suggested that Lange should stand on the Labour ticket for the Auckland City Council. The Council was dominated by conservative interests and the only Labour candidates elected were Jim Anderton and Catherine Tizard; Lange was &quot;...halfway down the field ... which was better than I expected.&quot; Lange&#x27;s father Roy, who was a doctor at Ōtāhuhu, had delivered Bassett. The two would later have strong disagreements, prompting Lange to remark, &quot;My father had delivered him, and it became plain in later days that he must have dropped him.&quot;

Lange then stood for Labour in Hobson in 1975, and came third. In 1977 he entered the race for the Labour nomination in a by-election for the safer seat of Mangere. He saw off more experienced candidates (some of whom were former MPs) to win the Labour candidacy. He won the Mangere by-election, retaining the area for Labour.

Lange then represented Mangere, a working-class Auckland electorate with a large Māori population, in the New Zealand Parliament. On becoming an MP, Lange quickly made an impression in the House as a debater, a wit, and the scourge of Prime Minister Robert Muldoon. In his maiden speech, he suggested that New Zealand children had fewer rights than animals received under the Animals Protection Act 1960, and complained of &quot;appalling&quot; rail service from Auckland to Mangere.

After the Lange was elevated to the Shadow Cabinet. In December 1978 Labour leader Bill Rowling appointed Lange Shadow Minister for Social Welfare. On 1 November 1979 Lange, after encouragement from parliamentary friends Roger Douglas and Michael Bassett, challenged Bob Tizard for the deputy leadership. Lange succeeded in the challenge, narrowly defeating Tizard 20 votes to 18. In addition to becoming Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Lange became Shadow Attorney-General, Shadow Minister of Justice and Shadow Minister of Pacific Island Affairs.

In 1980 Lange and a group consisting of Douglas, Bassett, Richard Prebble and Mike Moore tried to remove Rowling as leader of the Labour Party. Following the coup attempt Lange resigned as deputy leader in January 1981 to offer himself for re-election as a vote of confidence. At Labour&#x27;s first caucus meeting of the year he was re-elected as deputy leader. After Labour lost the 1981 general election, the group, later known as the &quot;Fish and Chip Brigade&quot; (in reference to a picture published at the time showing the plotters eating fish and chips) succeeded in their second attempt in 1983.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===

Lange succeeded Rowling as parliamentary leader of the Labour Party and as Leader of the Opposition on 3 February 1983. Significant debate emerged within the Labour Party on the party&#x27;s economic direction, following a paper by Roger Douglas to the party&#x27;s policy council. Eventually a compromise was drafted by Geoffrey Palmer, which Lange described as &quot;A manifesto which appealed to the right, the left, the centre and the totally bewildered. It was, in fact, anodyne.&quot;

Muldoon unexpectedly called a snap election in 1984, as a result of Marilyn Waring voting for a member&#x27;s bill introduced by Richard Prebble to introduce a nuclear-free zone. The timing of the election prevented Labour from creating a proper election platform, instead using the Palmer draft. Lange commented that the party went into the election with an unfinished argument for an economic policy.

Lange led Labour to a landslide victory, helped by vote splitting between the National Party and the New Zealand Party. However, before Lange was sworn in as Prime Minister a foreign exchange crisis arose, which led to a constitutional crisis. The New Zealand dollar was overvalued and following the announcement of the snap election in June, traders started selling off the New Zealand dollar on the assumption that Labour would win the election and devalue the currency.

Muldoon refused to follow Lange&#x27;s instruction to devalue the currency, making the dollar&#x27;s situation more untenable. Eventually on 19 July Muldoon relented, after his position as leader of the National party was threatened by members of his caucus.

== Prime Minister (1984–1989) ==
David Lange was sworn in as New Zealand&#x27;s 32nd Prime Minister on 26 July 1984, becoming, at the age of 41, New Zealand&#x27;s youngest prime minister of the 20th century, a record later surpassed by only one other, Mike Moore in 1990.

===First term: 1984–1987===
During his first term of office as Prime Minister, Lange also held the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs.

====Rogernomics====
The currency crisis and devaluation of the New Zealand dollar spurred on the reform drive of Roger Douglas, who Lange made Minister of Finance in the new government. These reforms were soon dubbed &#x27;Rogernomics&#x27;, in a similar vein to Reaganomics.

Upon coming to office, Lange&#x27;s government was confronted by a severe balance of payments crisis, as a result of the deficits fuelled by Muldoon&#x27;s imposition of a two-year freeze on wages and prices, and stubborn maintenance of an unsustainable exchange rate. Such economic conditions prompted Lange to remark: &quot;We ended up being run very similarly to a Polish shipyard&quot;. Their first move was to hold an Economic Summit on 14 September 1984, similar to the one held in Australia by Bob Hawke the previous year, to create a feeling of consensus and to lay out the underlying problems in New Zealand&#x27;s economy. The summit however was dominated by advocacy of radical economic reforms similar to what had been proposed by the Treasury Department, foreshadowing the Lange government&#x27;s propensity to approach issues from a fundamentally economic standpoint. Margaret Wilson, the Labour Party&#x27;s president, was deliberately not invited to the summit, a sign of the speed and intolerant approach to opposition that would characterise Rogernomics. Douglas himself saw the summit as a theatrical preparation for his first budget.

Lange and Douglas engaged in a rapid programme of deregulation and the removal of tariffs and subsidies. The first sector affected was New Zealand&#x27;s agricultural community, a traditionally National-supporting community. The loss of subsidies hit some farmers hard. Other changes brought criticism from many people in Labour&#x27;s traditional supporter base. The Labour Party also lost support from many elderly people by introducing a superannuation surcharge after having promised not to reduce superannuation.

Douglas also deregulated the finance markets, removing restrictions on interest rates, lending and foreign exchange. In March 1985, with Lange&#x27;s blessing, the New Zealand dollar was floated. From 1 April 1987, several government departments were corporatised into state-owned enterprises, with massive loss of jobs.

On the role of Government Lange said &quot;It is there to be the securer of its citizens&#x27; welfare. Where the market works well, it should be given its head. Where the market results in manifest inequity, or poor economic performance, the Government must get involved.&quot;

====International affairs and nuclear-free policy====
Lange made his name on the international stage with his steadfast leadership in the anti-nuclear weapons movement. His government refused to allow nuclear-capable ships into New Zealand&#x27;s territorial waters, a policy the country continues to this day. In February 1985, Lange famously rejected the arrival of the USS &quot;Buchanan&quot;, supported by a recommendation from the acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer. The ship was not armed with nuclear weapons but was capable of carrying them. This displeased the United States; in response, all intelligence flow to New Zealand was stopped and joint military exercises were cancelled. In 1985, there were 22 programmed exercises cancelled or restructured, resulting in approximately 6,000 man-days of training being taken away.
During a televised Oxford Union debate in March 1985, Lange gained an extraordinary international reputation. Lange argued for the proposition that &quot;Nuclear weapons are morally indefensible&quot;, in opposition to the American televangelist Jerry Falwell. Lange regarded his appearance at the Oxford Union as the high point of his career in politics. His speech included the memorable statement: 

&quot;There is no humanity in the logic which holds that my country must be obliged to play host to nuclear weapons because others in the West are playing host to nuclear weapons. That is the logic which refuses to admit that there is any alternative to nuclear weapons, when plainly there is. It is self defeating logic, just as the weapons themselves are self defeating, to compel an ally to accept nuclear weapons against the wishes of that ally is to take the moral position of totalitarianism which allows for no self determination.&quot; 
His speech also included an often-quoted statement made in response to a question posed by another debater:

In 1987, Lange&#x27;s government passed the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987. This Act effectively declared New Zealand a nuclear-free zone and banned all nuclear-capable ships from entering New Zealand waters. The United States regarded this legislation as a breach of treaty obligations under ANZUS and announced that it would suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand until the re-admission of U.S. Navy ships to New Zealand ports, characterising New Zealand as &quot;a friend, but not an ally&quot;.

====&quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; affair====
Relations with France became strained when French agents of the DGSE bombed and sank the Greenpeace ship the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; on 10 July 1985 while it lay moored in Auckland Harbour, killing photographer Fernando Pereira. In June 1986 Lange obtained a political deal with France over the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; affair, presided over by United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. France agreed to pay compensation of NZ$13 million (US$6.5 million) to New Zealand and also to apologise. In return, Lange agreed that French authorities could detain the convicted French agents Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur at the French military base on Hao Atoll for three years. However, both spies were freed by May 1988, less than two years later, in violation of the agreement.

==== Social reforms ====
During Lange&#x27;s first term in office, the Lange government implemented many social reforms. On 8 August 1986, the Lange government enacted the Homosexual Law Reform Act which legalised consensual sex of males 16 years and older and allowed them to enter into sexual relationships with one another without the fear of being prosecuted. On 1 August 1987, the Māori Language Act 1987 was enacted making te reo Māori an official language of New Zealand.

====1987 general election====

Lange&#x27;s government was re-elected at the August 1987 general election, the first time a Labour government had won a second term since 1938. The government increased its share of the popular vote, although this may have been due to less vote splitting. Lange toured the country throughout the campaign and faced, for the first time, protests against his government, especially in provincial areas. Unusually, Labour did not produce a manifesto for the election, primarily due to disagreement between Douglas and Lange over the direction the government would take if re-elected. Lange sought to focus on social services in the second term, and declared in his victory speech, &quot;I&#x27;m proud that we are now, in the next three years, going to seal those [economic] gains, in health and education and social welfare progress.&quot;

On the night, Labour&#x27;s candidate Judith Tizard came within 406 votes of winning the traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Labour had never come remotely close to winning the wealthy east Auckland seat before, even at its high-tide victories in 1972 and 1984. Tizard&#x27;s near-win fuelled Lange&#x27;s misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, &quot;That election night was a great revelation for me. That was an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set me to think what on earth have we done that we come within 400 votes of winning the true-blue [National] seat of Remuera. And that struck me as being a dangerous flirtation, and an act of treachery to the people we were born to represent.&quot;

===Second term: 1987–1989===
Following the 1987 election, Lange made himself Minister of Education. He stated that he gave himself the portfolio to &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot; against the influence of the &quot;Treasury &quot; (Douglas, Prebble and David Caygill), and in accordance with his wishes to emphasise social policy in his second term.

====Fijian coups d&#x27;état====

Lange was criticised for his reaction to the coups d&#x27;état in Fiji in May and September 1987. Later, in his autobiography, Lange stated:
There was never any question that New Zealand might use force to restore the democratically elected government, since we were not asked to intervene by its representatives and had we been, we did not have the military resources. I did however ask our military leaders to ready themselves to come to the assistance of any New Zealand citizens who might be endangered, and I met with considerable obstruction. 

====Stock market crash====
The stock market crash of 19/20 October 1987 damaged confidence in the New Zealand economy, which went into a prolonged recession from December of that year, and remained so until June 1991. During that time unemployment skyrocketed 170%, the unemployment rate rose from 4.2% in the September 1987 quarter to 7.5% in the June 1989 quarter. Lange noted with bitterness that Douglas took advantage of the crash to &quot;rubbish&quot; his stated ambitions to have the government focus on social policy, and push for more economic reforms.

====Tomorrow&#x27;s Schools====
As Minister of Education, Lange pushed the introduction of &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Schools&quot;, a radical restructure of New Zealand&#x27;s primary and secondary school education system. The Department of Education was downsized to become the Ministry of Education and have a supervisory role, education boards were abolished and parents at each school elected their own boards of trustees.

The reforms were criticised for the influence of New Right ideas and their effect of introducing market mechanisms and notions of competition in the education system. Lange&#x27;s appointment of businessman Brian Picot to head a task force into educational reform was taken as a sign of the government giving too much priority to economic and competitive concerns over the social aspect of education.

====Leadership challenge and resignation====

In 1988 consensus on economic policy amongst the Labour leadership finally broke down, with Douglas resigning after Lange overruled his radical flat income-tax and universal basic income proposal. Douglas continued his campaign against Lange through public statements, the unauthorised release of cabinet papers and on 21 December 1988 an unsuccessful challenge against Lange&#x27;s leadership in the Labour caucus. To date it is the only instance when a sitting Prime Minister has been challenged for leadership.

The radical economic reforms had alienated much of the Labour Party, and it fractured; in April 1989 Jim Anderton, a backbench MP, formed a breakaway NewLabour Party, taking approximately one third of Labour&#x27;s membership.

However, the caucus re-elected Douglas to the Cabinet on 3 August 1989, and Lange interpreted this as a vote of no-confidence in his leadership. He tendered his resignation five days later on 8 August 1989. Lange became the first elected Labour Prime Minister who neither died in office nor was voted out in an election.

====Leadership====
Lange&#x27;s leadership abilities were mixed and at times contradictory. As one of the most media-capable New Zealand prime ministers, he was a quick-witted orator and able to speak inspirationally to topics, yet was sensitive to criticism and averse to conflict. He often became caught up in how he was seen to perform and would often avoid confronting angry ministers by using a rear entrance. Despite being , Lange&#x27;s political skills were judged to be poor by political scientist Stephen Levine.

==Motor racing==

During his tenure as Prime Minister, Lange engaged in competitive motor racing, appearing in the New Zealand One Make Ford Laser Sport series.

==Post-premiership==
===Cabinet minister: 1989–1990===
Geoffrey Palmer succeeded Lange as Labour party leader and Prime Minister in 1989, Lange became Attorney-General, Minister in Charge of the Serious Fraud Office and a Minister of State. Palmer was then replaced by Mike Moore as Prime Minister shortly before the 1990 general election in November, which Labour lost by a landslide. Lange was re-elected at this election (and again in 1993) as the member for Mangere.

===Opposition and resignation from parliament===

After the government was defeated in 1990, he was appointed Shadow Attorney-General by Moore. After Moore led Labour to narrow loss in the 1993 general election, Lange backed deputy leader Helen Clark for the leadership against Moore. Clark replaced Moore as Labour leader and made Lange Shadow Minister of Foreign Affairs and Shadow Minister of Racing. In 1991 and 1992 he wrote a Monday column in &quot;The Dominion&quot;, published alternately with Simon Upton who, Lange commented, &quot;writes erudite obfuscation tempered by occasional attempts to explain the arcana of the health reforms.&quot;

Lange was a supporter of changing New Zealand&#x27;s flag, and wrote in 1994: &quot;[a] stranger who saw the Australian flag and the New Zealand flag outside adjacent buildings would assume that some British hotel chain was advertising deluxe and standard rooms&quot;. Lange also expressed support for a New Zealand republic, stating: &quot;Do such things matter? They certainly do. We suffer in this country from a lack of emotional focus... New Zealand will become a republic just as Britain will be blurred into Europe&quot;.

In failing health, Lange retired from Parliament before the 1996 general election. In his valedictory speech, he reflected on the pain caused by his government&#x27;s economic reforms: &quot;I want to thank those people whose lives were wrecked by us. They had been taught for years they had the right to an endless treadmill of prosperity and assurance, and we did them. People over 60 hate me. They hate me because I was the symbol of what caused that assurance of support and security to be shattered. That is something that has always been part of my burden.&quot; His Labour Party colleague Taito Phillip Field succeeded him as the member for the Mangere electorate.

===Life after politics===
Lange was a New Zealand Rugby League board member and served as the organisation&#x27;s Vice-President.

In an interview with &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; (published on 3 July 2004) the reporter asked Lange:

:&quot;Do you think if the election of 1984 had not been a snap election, there would have been time for the opposing forces within the party to have successfully blocked the reforms or to have severely limited them?&quot;

Lange replied:


====Litigation====
In 1996 Lange sued the Australian Broadcasting Corporation over an alleged defamation that it broadcast about him. The ABC used the defence that there exists in the Australian Constitution an implied right to freedom of speech on political matters, but the High Court of Australia found against them, reversing the then existing law (see &quot;Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot;). The case was later settled on terms favourable to Lange.

In a key New Zealand defamation case (&quot;Lange v Atkinson&quot; [2000] 3 NZLR 385), Lange sued political scientist Joe Atkinson for representing him in the magazine &quot;North &amp; South&quot; as a lazy prime minister. In a 1998 judgment, and on appeal in 2000, the courts affirmed a new qualified privilege for the media to discuss politicians when expressing the criticisms as the &quot;honest belief&quot; of the author.

====Accidental release of secret report====
In January 2006, Archives New Zealand released to the &quot;Sunday Star-Times&quot; newspaper a box of David Lange&#x27;s previously classified documents. They revealed New Zealand&#x27;s ongoing involvement in Western alliance espionage, and a threat by the United States to spy on New Zealand if it did not back down from its ban on nuclear ships. Archives New Zealand chief executive Dianne Macaskill said the paper did not have the authority to access or print the report, and wrote to the paper revoking permission to publish it. In response, the &quot;Sunday Star Times&quot; said the information had already been released into the public arena and hence could not be retracted. The release of the document prompted a high-level inquiry to investigate how the top-secret report ended up in Lange&#x27;s personal papers, in breach of security protocol. A secret diplomatic cable leaked in 2010 covers the accidental release of the document.

==Personal life==
Lange was raised in a Methodist family. In the 1960s he worked alongside Methodist theologian Donald Soper at the West London Methodist Mission in England. He was deeply influenced by Soper&#x27;s interpretation of Christian socialism. Lange later became a Methodist lay preacher.

In 1989 Lange announced in a brief press statement on 10 November that he was separating from his wife of 21 years. On 12 November Naomi Lange named his speech-writer, Margaret Pope, as &quot;the other woman&quot; in a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; article, and said that she had been told by her husband five or six months beforehand that he planned to leave the marriage. Lange&#x27;s mother Phoebe also publicly criticised him, but they later reconciled. He had three children, Roy, Emily, and Byron, with his first wife Naomi, and one daughter, Edith, with his second wife Margaret. Lange married Margaret in Glasgow on 12 January 1992 while holidaying in Britain.

Lange&#x27;s brother Peter is a widely respected New Zealand potter. He has won numerous arts awards and has exhibited widely in New Zealand and overseas. Lange&#x27;s third cousin Michael Bassett became a fellow Cabinet-minister. Bassett published a book in 2008 about the Lange government entitled &quot;Working With David: Inside the Lange Cabinet&quot;.

===Health issues and death===

Lange suffered all his life from obesity and the health problems it caused. By 1982 he weighed about , and had surgery to staple his stomach in order to lose weight.

In the 1990s Lange&#x27;s health declined, with diabetes and kidney disorders. In 2002, doctors diagnosed Lange as having amyloidosis, a rare and incurable blood plasma disorder. He underwent extensive medical treatment for this condition. Although initially told he had only four months to live, Lange defied his doctors&#x27; expectations, and remained &quot;optimistic&quot; about his health. He entered hospital in Auckland in mid-July 2005 to undergo nightly peritoneal dialysis in his battle with end-stage kidney failure. On 2 August, he had his lower right leg amputated without a general anaesthetic, as a result of diabetes complications.

Lange&#x27;s declining health resulted in the bringing-forward of the publication of his memoir &quot;My Life&quot; to 8 August 2005. TV3 broadcast on &quot;Campbell Live&quot; on the same day an interview; John Campbell had interviewed him just before he went into hospital. In his last interview, given to the &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; from his hospital bed, he made a potent intervention in New Zealand&#x27;s 2005 election campaign by saying he &quot;wanted to get out of bed and get a wheel-chair to Wellington&quot; to stop any relaxation of his ban on nuclear ships.

Lange died of complications associated with his renal failure and blood disease in Middlemore Hospital in Auckland on 13 August 2005, just five days after the publication and interview, and nine days after his 63rd birthday. He is buried at Waikaraka Cemetery and the headstone has the simple inscription &quot;David Lange 1942 ~ 2005&quot;. The David Lange Memorial Trust erected a memorial sculpture by Virginia King in Ōtāhuhu, which was unveiled by the Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand in 2008.

==Honours and awards==

Lange received the Right Livelihood Award in 2003 for his strong fight against nuclear weapons.

In the 1990 New Year Honours, Lange was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, and in the 2003 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was made a Member of the Order of New Zealand, the country&#x27;s highest civil honour. He turned down the knighthood that is customarily offered to former prime ministers.

<doc id="308830" wikidata="Q670637" url="?curid=308830" title="No Exit">
<text>No Exit (, ) is a 1944 existentialist French play by Jean-Paul Sartre. The play was first performed at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier in May 1944. The play centers around a depiction of the afterlife in which three deceased characters are punished by being locked into a room together for eternity. It is the source of Sartre&#x27;s especially famous phrase &quot;L&#x27;enfer, c&#x27;est les autres&quot; or &quot;Hell is other people&quot;, a reference to Sartre&#x27;s ideas about the look and the perpetual ontological struggle of being caused to see oneself as an object from the view of another consciousness.

English translations have also been performed under the titles In Camera, No Way Out, Vicious Circle, Behind Closed Doors, and Dead End. The original title, (&#x27;closed door&#x27;), is the French equivalent of the legal term &quot;in camera&quot; (from Latin, &#x27;in a chamber&#x27;), referring to a private discussion behind closed doors.

==Plot==
Three damned souls, Joseph Garcin, Inèz Serrano, and Estelle Rigault, are brought to the same room in Hell and locked inside by a mysterious valet. They had all expected torture devices to punish them for eternity, but instead, find a plain room furnished in the style of the French &quot;Second Empire&quot;. At first, none of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Garcin says that he was executed for being an outspoken pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made; Inèz, however, is the only one to demand that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their moral crimes. She refuses to believe that they have all ended up in the room by accident and soon realizes that they have been placed together to make each other miserable. She deduces that they are to be one another&#x27;s torturers.

Garcin suggests that they try to leave each other alone and to be silent, but Inèz starts to sing about execution and Estelle vainly wants to find a mirror to check on her appearance. Inèz tries to seduce Estelle by offering to be her &quot;mirror&quot; by telling her everything she sees but ends up frightening her instead. It is soon clear that Inèz is attracted to Estelle, Estelle is attracted to Garcin, and Garcin is not attracted to either of the two women.

After arguing, they decide to confess to their crimes so they know what to expect from each other. Garcin cheated on and mistreated his wife, and was executed by firing squad for desertion; Inèz is a manipulative sadist who seduced her cousin&#x27;s wife, Florence, while living with them and convinced her to leave her husband—the cousin was later hit and killed by a tram and Florence asphyxiated herself and Inèz by flooding the room with gas while they slept—and Estelle had an affair and then killed the resulting child, prompting the child&#x27;s father to commit suicide. Despite their revelations, they continue to get on each other&#x27;s nerves. Garcin finally begins giving in to the lascivious Estelle&#x27;s escalating attempts to seduce him, which drives Inèz crazy. Garcin is constantly interrupted by his own guilt, however, and begs Estelle to tell him that he is not a coward for attempting to flee his country during wartime. While she complies, Inèz mockingly tells him that Estelle is just feigning attraction to him so that she can be with a man—any man.

This causes Garcin to abruptly attempt an escape. After he repeatedly tries to open the door, it suddenly and inexplicably opens, but he is unable to bring himself to leave. The others remain as well. He says that he will not be saved until he can convince Inèz that he is not cowardly. She refuses to be persuaded, observing that he is obviously a coward and promising to make him miserable forever. Garcin concludes that, rather than torture devices or physical punishment, &quot;hell is other people.&quot; Estelle tries to persevere in her seduction of Garcin, but he says that he cannot make love while Inèz is watching. Estelle, infuriated, picks up a paper knife and repeatedly stabs Inèz. Inèz chides Estelle, saying that they are all already dead, and even furiously stabs herself to prove that point. As Estelle begins to laugh hysterically at the idea of them being dead and trapped together forever, the others join in a prolonged fit of laughter before Garcin finally concludes, &quot;Eh bien, continuons...&quot; (&quot;Oh well, let&#x27;s continue...&quot;).

==Characters==
Joseph Garcin – He is a journalist who lived in the barracks in Rio and died after refusing to fight in an unnamed war. His cowardice and callousness caused his young wife to die &quot;of grief&quot; after his execution. He was unfaithful to his wife – he even recalls, without any sympathy, bringing home another woman one night, and his wife bringing them their morning coffee after hearing their engagement all night. Initially, he hates Inèz because she understands his weakness, and wants Estelle because he feels that if she treats him as a man he will become manly. However, by the end of the play he understands that because Inèz understands the meaning of cowardice and wickedness, only absolution at her hands can redeem him (if indeed redemption is possible). In a later translation and adaptation of the play by American translator Paul Bowles, Garcin is renamed Vincent Cradeau.

Inèz Serrano – Inèz is the second character to enter the room. A lesbian postal clerk, she turned a wife against her husband, twisting the wife&#x27;s perception of her spouse and the subsequent death of the man who is also her cousin. Inèz seems to be the only character who understands the power of opinion, manipulating Estelle&#x27;s and Garcin&#x27;s opinions of themselves and of each other throughout the play. She is honest about the evil deeds she, Garcin, and Estelle have done. She frankly acknowledges the fact that she is a cruel person.

Estelle Rigault – Estelle is a high-society woman, who married an older man for his money and had an affair with a younger man. To her, the affair is merely an insignificant fling, but her lover becomes emotionally attached to her and she bears him a child. She drowns the child by throwing it off the balcony of a hotel into the sea, which drives her lover to commit suicide. Throughout the play she tries to get at Garcin, seeking to define herself as a woman in relation to a man. Her sins are deceit and murder (which also motivated a suicide). She lusts over &quot;manly men&quot;, which Garcin himself strives to be.

Valet – The Valet enters the room with each character, but his only real dialogue is with Garcin. We learn little about him, except that his uncle is the head valet, and that his eyelids are atrophied because he does not blink.

==Critical reception==
The play was widely praised when it was first performed. Upon its 1946 American premiere at the Biltmore Theatre, critic Stark Young described the play as &quot;a phenomenon of the modern theatre – played all over the continent already&quot;, in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and wrote that &quot;It should be seen whether you like it or not.&quot;

<doc id="308831" wikidata="Q382353" url="?curid=308831" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)">
<text>The Phantom of the Opera is a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, lyrics by Charles Hart, additional lyrics by Richard Stilgoe, and a libretto by Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe. Based on the novel by Gaston Leroux, it tells the tragic story of beautiful soprano Christine Daaé, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious and disfigured musical genius living in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Paris Opéra House.

The musical opened in London&#x27;s West End in 1986 and on Broadway in New York in 1988, in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring English classical soprano Sarah Brightman (Lloyd Webber&#x27;s then-wife) as Christine Daaé, screen and stage star Michael Crawford as the Phantom, and international stage performer Steve Barton as Raoul. It won the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical, with Crawford winning the Olivier and Tony for Best Actor in a Musical. A film adaptation, directed by Joel Schumacher, was released in 2004.

&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was the longest running show in Broadway history, and celebrated its 10,000th performance on 11 February 2012, becoming the first Broadway production in history to do so. It is the second longest-running West End musical, after &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and the third longest-running West End show overall, after &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;. With total estimated worldwide gross receipts of over $6 billion and total Broadway gross of over $1 billion, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was the most financially successful entertainment event until &quot;The Lion King&quot; surpassed it in 2014. By 2019, it had been seen by over 140 million people in 183 cities across 41 countries.

The original West End production at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London, ended its run in 2020, its run cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. A new production of &quot;Phantom,&quot; with a &quot;smaller orchestra and redesigned set&quot;, opened in the same theatre in July 2021. The original Broadway production played its final performance on 16 April 2023. The musical is set to begin a North American tour in November 2025.

==Synopsis==
===Prologue===
In the year 1919, the Paris Opéra House hosts an auction of old theatre memorabilia. Among the attendees is an aged Raoul de Chagny, who purchases Lot 665, a papier-mâché music box with a monkey figurine. He eyes it sadly, cryptically observing that it appears &quot;exactly as she said&quot;. The next lot – Lot 666 – is a broken chandelier, portions of which have been renovated with electrical wiring. The auctioneer states that this chandelier was involved in a famous disaster, connected to &quot;the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera, a mystery never fully explained&quot;. He commands the auction assistants to turn on the power and light up the chandelier for all to see. As the overture plays, it flickers to life and ascends to the ceiling, as a transition back in time restores the opera house to its former grandeur (&quot;Overture&quot;).

===Act I===
The year is 1881 – the cast of a new production, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, is rehearsing (&quot;Hannibal Rehearsal&quot;). Carlotta, the Opéra&#x27;s resident soprano prima donna, begins to perform an aria when a backdrop inexplicably falls from the flies, causing anxious chorus girls to shout, &quot;He&#x27;s here! The Phantom of the Opera!&quot; The new owners, Firmin and André, try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily storms offstage. Madame Giry, the Opéra&#x27;s ballet mistress, suggests that Christine Daaé, a chorus girl and orphaned daughter of a prominent Swedish violinist, has been &quot;well taught&quot; and can sing Carlotta&#x27;s role. As their only alternative is cancelling the sold-out show, the managers reluctantly audition her, and discover that she is indeed talented. As Christine sings the aria during the evening performance, the Opéra&#x27;s new patron, Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, recognizes her as his childhood friend and playmate (&quot;Think of Me&quot;).
Backstage after her triumphant debut, Christine confesses to her friend, Madame Giry&#x27;s daughter Meg, that her singing has been inspired by an unseen tutor she knows only as the &quot;Angel of Music&quot; (&quot;Angel of Music&quot;). Raoul visits Christine in her dressing room and the two reminisce about &quot;Angel of Music&quot; stories that her late father used to tell them. Christine confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing (&quot;Little Lotte&quot;). Raoul indulges what he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When Raoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the jealous Phantom&#x27;s voice and entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom obliges by appearing in her mirror (&quot;The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)&quot;). Christine is hypnotized and irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her down into the shadowy sewers below the Opéra house. The two board a small boat and cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair (&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his musical compositions. A mirror reflects an image of her in a wedding dress; when the mirror image spreads its arms towards the real Christine, she faints from shock. The Phantom lays her on a bed and covers her tenderly with his cloak (&quot;The Music of the Night&quot;).

As the Phantom is composing music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box (&quot;I Remember&quot;). She slips behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his disfigured face. The Phantom rails at her prying, then ruefully expresses his longing to be loved (&quot;Stranger Than You Dreamt It&quot;). Moved by pity, Christine returns the mask to the Phantom, and he escorts her back above ground.

Meanwhile, Joseph Buquet, the Opéra&#x27;s chief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the &quot;Opéra Ghost&quot; and his terrible Punjab lasso. Madame Giry warns Buquet to restrain himself (&quot;Magical Lasso&quot;). Arguments break out in the managers&#x27; office between Firmin, André, Raoul, and Carlotta over notes sent by the Phantom, including a demand that Christine replace Carlotta in the starring role of the new opera, &quot;Il Muto&quot; (&quot;Notes&quot;). Firmin and André assure the furious Carlotta that she will remain the star (&quot;Prima Donna&quot;).

The première of &quot;Il Muto&quot; initially goes well, until the Phantom suddenly enchants Carlotta&#x27;s voice, reducing it to a frog-like croak. Firmin rushes to defuse the situation by announcing to the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, and he instructs the conductor to bring the ballet forward to keep the audience entertained. Buquet&#x27;s corpse drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Mayhem erupts and the Phantom&#x27;s evil &amp; sinister laugh is heard throughout the auditorium (&quot;Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh&quot;).

In the ensuing chaos, Christine escapes with Raoul to the rooftop and tells him about her subterranean encounter with the Phantom (&quot;Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I&#x27;ve Been There&quot;). Raoul is skeptical but promises to love and protect her (&quot;All I Ask of You&quot;). The Phantom, who overheard their conversation, is heartbroken and swears revenge on Christine. In the auditorium, the chandelier crashes onto the stage during the &quot;Il Muto&quot; curtain call (&quot;All I Ask of You (Reprise)&quot;).

===Act II===

Six months later, the Opera house hosts a masquerade ball. The Phantom, who has been conspicuously absent since the chandelier disaster, appears in costume as the Red Death. He announces that he has written an opera entitled &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot;, and demands that it be produced with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) in the lead role. He pulls Christine&#x27;s engagement ring from the chain around her neck and vanishes in a flash of light (&quot;Masquerade/Why So Silent&quot;).

Raoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. She reluctantly explains that the Phantom is a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer, who was born with a deformed face. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a travelling fair until he eventually escaped and took refuge beneath the opera house.

Raoul plots to use the première of &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot; to trap the Phantom and end his reign of terror, knowing he will attend the opera&#x27;s debut. He begs Christine to help lure the Phantom into the trap (&quot;Notes/Twisted Every Way&quot;). During rehearsals, Piangi, the house tenor, sings his role incorrectly, causing chaos. The piano suddenly plays by itself, with the entire cast singing in harmony. Torn between her love for Raoul and her loyalty to the Phantom, Christine visits her father&#x27;s grave, begging for his guidance (&quot;Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again&quot;). The Phantom appears atop the mausoleum (&quot;Wandering Child&quot;). Christine begins to succumb to the Phantom&#x27;s influence, but Raoul arrives to rescue her. The Phantom taunts Raoul, hurling fire balls at him until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her. Furious, the Phantom declares war upon them both.

&quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot; premieres with Christine and Piangi singing the respective lead roles of Aminta and Don Juan. During Don Juan and Aminta&#x27;s duet, Christine realizes that the Phantom has somehow replaced Piangi (&quot;Don Juan Triumphant/The Point of No Return&quot;). She calmly removes his mask, revealing his deformed face to the horrified audience. Exposed, the Phantom hurriedly drags Christine off the stage and back to his lair. Piangi&#x27;s garrotted body is revealed backstage and the opera house plunges into chaos. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for the murders of Buquet and Piangi, search for the Phantom. Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom&#x27;s subterranean lair and warns him to beware the magical lasso (&quot;Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer&quot;).

In the lair, the Phantom forces Christine to don a wedding dress. Raoul comes to the rescue but is ensnared in the Punjab lasso. The Phantom offers Christine an ultimatum: if she will stay with him, he will spare Raoul, but if she refuses, Raoul will die (&quot;The Point of No Return Reprise&quot;). Christine tells the Phantom that he&#x27;s not alone and kisses him.

Having experienced both kindness and compassion for the first time, the Phantom frees Raoul. He also tells Christine that he loves her and she tearfully exits the lair with Raoul. As the angry search mob closes in, the Phantom huddles on his throne beneath his cloak. Meg is the first to enter the lair. She approaches the Phantom&#x27;s throne and pulls away the cloak, finding only his mask (&quot;Finale&quot;).

==Development==
===Idea===
In 1984, Lloyd Webber contacted Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Song and Dance&quot;, to propose a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic and tragic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux&#x27;s book &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw any effective way to make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: said Lloyd Webber, &quot;I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!&quot;

=== Lyricists ===
Lloyd Webber first approached Jim Steinman to write the lyrics because of his &quot;dark obsessive side&quot;, but he declined in order to fulfill his commitments on a Bonnie Tyler album. Alan Jay Lerner (1918–1986) was then recruited, but he became seriously ill after joining the project and was forced to withdraw; none of his contributions (mostly involving the song &quot;Masquerade&quot;) are credited in the show. Richard Stilgoe, the lyricist for &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, was then hired and wrote most of the original lyrics for the show. However, Charles Hart, a young and then-relatively unknown lyricist, later rewrote many of the lyrics, along with original lyrics for &quot;Think of Me&quot;. Some of Stilgoe&#x27;s original contributions are still present in the final version nevertheless.

===Score===
Inspired in part by an earlier musical version of the same story by Ken Hill, Lloyd Webber&#x27;s score is sometimes operatic in style but maintains the form and structure of a musical throughout. The full-fledged operatic passages are reserved principally for subsidiary characters such as André and Firmin, Carlotta, and Piangi. They are also used to provide the content of the fictional operas that are taking place within the show itself, viz., &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &quot;Il Muto&quot;, and the Phantom&#x27;s masterwork, &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot;. &quot;Here, Lloyd Webber pastiched various styles from the grand operas of Meyerbeer through to Mozart and even Gilbert and Sullivan.&quot; These pieces are often presented as musical fragments, interrupted by dialogue or action sequences in order to clearly define the musical&#x27;s &quot;show within a show&quot; format. The musical extracts from the Phantom&#x27;s opera, &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot;, heard during the latter stages of the show, are dissonant and modern—&quot;suggesting, perhaps, that the Phantom is ahead of his time artistically&quot;.

In the musical&#x27;s title song, the signature, chromatic five-note descending eighth-note run from the major root to the flat 6th below is directly similar to a riff created by Pink Floyd for the track &quot;Echoes&quot; on their 1971 album &quot;Meddle&quot;, something noted with indignation by Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters in a 1992 interview.

===Design, direction, and choreography===
Maria Björnson designed the sets and over 200 costumes, including the elaborate gowns in the &quot;Masquerade&quot; sequence. Her set designs, including the chandelier, subterranean gondola, and sweeping staircase, earned her multiple awards. Hal Prince, director of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Candide&quot;, &quot;Follies&quot;, and Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Evita&quot;, directed the production, while Gillian Lynne, associate director and choreographer of &quot;Cats&quot;, provided the integral musical staging and choreography.

===First preview at Sydmonton===
A preview of the first act was staged at Sydmonton Court (Lloyd Webber&#x27;s home) in 1985, starring Colm Wilkinson (later the star of the Toronto production) as the Phantom, Sarah Brightman as Kristin (later Christine), and Clive Carter (later a member of the London cast) as Raoul, West End star David Burt was also featured as Monsieur Firmin and Jeff Shankley played opposite him as Monsieur André. This very preliminary production used Richard Stilgoe&#x27;s original unaltered lyrics, and many songs sported names that were later changed, such as &quot;What Has Time Done to Me&quot; (&quot;Think of Me&quot;), and &quot;Papers&quot; (&quot;Notes&quot;). The Phantom&#x27;s original mask covered the entire face and remained in place throughout the performance, obscuring the actor&#x27;s vision and muffling his voice. Maria Björnson designed the now-iconic half-mask to replace it, and the unmasking sequence was added. Clips of this preview performance were included on the DVD of the 2004 film production.

==Productions==
===West End===
&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; began previews at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End on 27 September 1986 under the direction of Hal Prince, then opened on 9 October. It was choreographed by Gillian Lynne and the sets were designed by Maria Björnson, with lighting by Andrew Bridge. Michael Crawford starred in the title role with Sarah Brightman as Christine, Steve Barton as Raoul, Rosemary Ashe as Carlotta, David Firth as Monsieur André, John Savident as Monsieur Firmin, Mary Millar as Madame Giry, Janet Devenish as Meg Giry, and John Aron as Piangi. When Crawford, Brightman, and Barton left the cast to open the Broadway production they were replaced by Dave Willetts, Claire Moore, and Michael Ball respectively. The production celebrated its 10,000th performance on 23 October 2010, with Lloyd Webber and the original Phantom, Crawford, in attendance. The 30th anniversary was on 10 October 2016 with a special appearance of the original cast during the curtain call. It is the second longest-running musical in West End history behind &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and third overall behind &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;.

The production played its final and 13,919th performance on 14 March 2020, due to the shutdown of theatres resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The following month, it was announced that an &quot;extended closure&quot; of the original London production would be required to refurbish the sets and the theatre. In July 2020, social media outlets posted photographs of the sets, props, and costumes being loaded out from Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. As Mackintosh had only recently closed the original 1985 London production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in order to replace it with a newer production that had previously toured the UK, speculation mounted that the original production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was to be overhauled or replaced entirely. Confirmation of this speculation was given on 28 July 2020, when Mackintosh announced that he and Lloyd Webber had decided to &quot;permanently close&quot; the original London production after a 33-year run, but that the two were &quot;determined&quot; for the musical to return to the West End.

In response to this announcement, the Really Useful Group denied that the original production was permanently closing, stating that the extended closure was simply to enable a refurbishment of the theatre and that the show would return &quot;unchanged&quot; and any returning production would &quot;not be a new version of the show&quot;, but without confirming upon request by &quot;The Stage&quot; as to whether the production&#x27;s 27-piece orchestra would return. In October 2020, Mackintosh contradicted this clarification by stating that the &quot;new version&quot; based on the 2020 UK tour would in fact be the production that would be staged at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre post-pandemic.

Mackintosh confirmed in an interview on 4 December 2020 that the original London staging had officially ended, with investors having been given their closing notices, and that the 2020 tour would be moved into the show&#x27;s original home at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Lloyd Webber and Mackintosh announced a planned reopening on 27 July 2021. Planning documentation submitted by LW Theatres confirmed considerable redesigns of Maria Björnson&#x27;s set, with the removal of the Angel statue, reductions in the mobility of the travelator and candelabra, and fewer grotesques on the proscenium as had featured in the original production. It was additionally confirmed on 12 April 2021 that, contrary to claims by Lloyd Webber that the original production would return &quot;in its entirety&quot;, the orchestra of the original production (once the largest for any West End musical) was to be halved for the show&#x27;s return to the West End using the reduced tour orchestrations. On 15 April 2021, Mackintosh confirmed that the original staging would not be reinstated at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and that the designs of Maria Björnson, direction of Hal Prince, and choreography of Gillian Lynne would be &quot;reimagined by a new team&quot;. The producer reconfirmed in an interview with the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in April 2021 that the 2020 reduced touring redesigns would replace the originals at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Full casting for the reopening was announced on 27 April 2021, with all previous longtime cast members having departed the show.

====2021 West End revival ====
The second West End production of &quot;Phantom&quot; opened on 27 July 2021 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, where the original production had premiered 35 years previously. Although Lloyd Webber described the show as &quot;substantially identical&quot; to the original production, this second West End production is &quot;a reduced, cheaper version, with 14 musicians in an orchestra that used to have 27&quot;. Alterations were additionally made to the show&#x27;s set design by Matt Kinley in order to &quot;reduce running costs&quot;. This included, among other modifications, the loss of Maria Björnson&#x27;s sculptures covering the sides of the proscenium (previously described by Harold Prince as the &quot;key to the show&quot;) and the levitating Angel statue during the &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; sequence (replaced by a replica of Lequesne&#x27;s &quot;La Renommée retenant Pégase&quot; that appears on the stage). Other sequences, including that of the descent to the lair (in which doubles of the Phantom and Christine were excised, previously mobile candelabra became stationary, and the number of candles populating the lake were reduced), were also restaged by Seth Sklar-Heyn. The use of sweeping red curtain that had concluded each act of the original production was replaced by a painted flat, and the mobility of the &#x27;travelator&#x27; bridge was reduced. Whereas Prince had envisioned the show as a &quot;black box&quot; production requiring the use of black velour and paint around the proscenium, this was removed as part of the restoration to Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, with once blacked-out stage boxes returned to their original green and red colours and reintroduced for audience use. The orchestra was reduced to 14 players from the original 27. The reopened show&#x27;s cast featured Killian Donnelly as the Phantom, Lucy St. Louis as Christine, Rhys Whitfield as Raoul, Saori Oda as Carlotta, and other cast members from the aborted 2020 UK tour.

New casting was announced on 18 January 2023 with Earl Carpenter and Jon Robyns starring as the Phantom respectively from 13 February to 1 April and from 3 April 2023, and Holly-Anne Hull starring as Christine Daae from 23 January.

===Broadway===

&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; began Broadway previews at the Majestic Theatre on 9 January 1988 and opened on 26 January. Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman, and Steve Barton reprised their respective roles from the West End. The rest of the original Broadway cast included Judy Kaye as Carlotta, Cris Groenendaal as Monsieur André, Nicholas Wyman as Monsieur Firmin, Elisa Heinsohn as Meg Giry, Leila Martin as Madame Giry, and David Romano as Piangi. When Crawford left the production in October 1988 to appear in the first national tour he was replaced by noted baritone Timothy Nolen. Nolen was replaced by Groenendaal six months later. In March 1990, Barton returned to the production for a nine-month stint as the Phantom. The production continued to play at the Majestic, where it became the first Broadway musical in history to surpass 10,000 performances on 11 February 2012 before ultimately closing on 16 April 2023. On 26 January 2013, the production celebrated its 25th anniversary with its 10,400th performance. It is, by over 3,500 performances, the longest-running show in Broadway history. The 30th anniversary was on 26 January 2018 with special activities and an extra performance during the week. By April 2019, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; had been staged over 13,000 times. Howard McGillin and Hugh Panaro are the two longest running principal Phantoms in the production. Norm Lewis was the first African American actor to portray the Phantom on Broadway.

Critical reviews were mostly positive on opening. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Frank Rich writes: &quot;It may be possible to have a terrible time at &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, but you&#x27;ll have to work at it. Only a terminal prig would let the avalanche of pre-opening publicity poison his enjoyment of this show, which usually wants nothing more than to shower the audience with fantasy and fun, and which often succeeds, at any price.&quot; Howard Kissel from &quot;New York Daily News&quot; commended the production, calling it &quot;a spectacular entertainment, visually the most impressive of the British musicals&quot;, and praised Lloyd Webber&#x27;s score despite its &quot;synthetic, borrowed quality&quot; as well as Michael Crawford&#x27;s &quot;powerful&quot; performance. Maria Björnson&#x27;s set and costume design in particular garnered critical acclaim, with reviewers calling it &quot;a breathtaking, witty, sensual tribute to 19th century theater&quot; as well as &quot;marvels of period atmospheric detail and technical savvy&quot;.

On 12 March 2020, the show suspended production due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and resumed performances on 22 October 2021. Unlike the West End production, the Broadway show returned with the original Harold Prince-directed production and Maria Björnson&#x27;s original set and costume designs. After Prince&#x27;s death in 2019, his daughter Daisy, who is also a theater director, began serving as an informal advisor for the production.

The production struggled to return to pre-pandemic attendance levels after its return. In September 2022, it was scheduled to close on 18 February 2023, shortly after its 35th anniversary. After this announcement, attendance surged, and the closing was pushed back to 16 April 2023. The final Broadway cast included Ben Crawford as the Phantom, Emilie Kouatchou as Christine, John Riddle as Raoul, Raquel Suarez Groen as Carlotta, Nehal Joshi as Monsieur André, Craig Bennett as Monsieur Firmin, Maree Johnson as Madame Giry, Carlton Moe as Piangi, and Sara Etsy as Meg Giry. However, during the last two weeks on Broadway, Crawford was out sick. From 2 to 8 April and 13 April, understudy Jeremy Stolle played the Phantom. At four performances from 3 to 15 April, Ted Keegan played the Phantom. Laird Mackintosh played the Phantom during the 14 and 15 April evening performances and for the final performance on 16 April, becoming the last person to play the title role in the original Broadway production. By its closing date, the Broadway production had played 13,981 performances (exceeding its London counterpart by 62 performances). 
Immediately following the closure of the Broadway production, Andrew Lloyd Webber appeared on the Tonight Show and hinted a likely revival of &quot;Phantom&quot; in the near future at a different theater. This is widely speculated by industry insiders to constitute a Broadway transfer of the downscaled second London production, particularly in light of that smaller production&#x27;s planned US tour in 2024.

===Other UK productions===
A 25th-anniversary stage performance was held in London on 1 and 2 October 2011 at the Royal Albert Hall and was screened live in cinemas worldwide. The production was produced by Cameron Mackintosh, directed by Laurence Connor, musical staging &amp; choreography by Gillian Lynne, set design by Matt Kinley, costume design by Maria Björnson, lighting design by Patrick Woodroffe, and sound design by Mick Potter. The cast included Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom, Sierra Boggess as Christine, Hadley Fraser as Raoul, Wynne Evans as Piangi, Wendy Ferguson as Carlotta, Barry James as Monsieur Firmin, Gareth Snook as Monsieur Andre, Liz Robertson as Madame Giry, and Daisy Maywood as Meg Giry. Former West End Phantom Earl Carpenter played the Auctioneer. Lloyd Webber and several original cast members, including Crawford and Brightman, were in attendance, as well as Colm Wilkinson and Anthony Warlow who originated the role of the Phantom in Canada and Australia respectively. A DVD and Blu-ray of the performance was released in February 2012, and it began airing in March 2012 on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; television series.

In March 2012, a new production directed by Laurence Connor began a UK and Ireland tour to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the show, beginning at the Theatre Royal Plymouth and travelled to Manchester, Bristol, Dublin, Leeds, Edinburgh, Milton Keynes, Cardiff, and Southampton. John Owen-Jones and Earl Carpenter alternated as the Phantom, with Katie Hall as Christine and Simon Bailey as Raoul. 
In November 2019, the co-producers of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, Mackintosh and Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Group (RUG), announced that the show would again tour the UK and Ireland, but this time with a return to the original production rather than the 2012 production. Although this announcement stated that the tour would be an &quot;exact replica&quot; of the musical on Broadway and in the West End, alterations were made to the set design in order to make the tour &quot;lighter&quot;. These included a scaling down of the production&#x27;s false proscenium, with the centrepiece Angel statue designed by Maria Björnson removed. Performances of this latest 2020 tour were suspended from 16 March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, Mackintosh and RUG announced the premature closure of the tour as a result. Rather than resume the tour following the end of COVID-19-related shutdowns, the producers installed that production into Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London in July 2021, where it replaced Hal Prince&#x27;s original production.

===Other international productions===
&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; has been translated into several languages and produced in over 40 countries on 6 continents.

===&quot;Phantom: The Las Vegas Spectacular&quot;===

An edited production renamed &quot;Phantom: The Las Vegas Spectacular&quot; opened 24 June 2006 at The Venetian Las Vegas. The show starred Brent Barrett and Anthony Crivello as the Phantom, Sierra Boggess and Elizabeth Loyacano as Christine, and Tim Martin Gleason as Raoul. The theatre was built specifically for the show to resemble the Opéra Garnier in Paris. The production ran 95 minutes with no intermission, and was directed and choreographed by Harold Prince and Gillian Lynne, with scenic designs by David Rockwell. The show featured updated technology and effects, including a re-engineered chandelier capable of reassembling in midair during the overture while the entire interior of the venue (not merely the stage) returned to its 1880s halcyon days. Almost 45 minutes&#x27; worth of material was eliminated, such as the &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot; rehearsal. &quot;Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh&quot; while &quot;The Point of No Return&quot; were significantly shortened. Other changes resembled those in the 2004 film, such as staging the chandelier crash at the plot&#x27;s climax (during performance of &quot;The Point of No Return&quot;) rather than mid-story. Due to economic reasons, the Las Vegas production closed on 2 September 2012, after five years and almost 2,700 performances.

===Planned French production===
A production was originally planned for the first ever French production in Paris at the Mogador Theatre in September 2016. Sierra Boggess was set to reprise her performance as Christine and Garðar Thór Cortes was cast as The Phantom. A few days before the premiere, a fire damaged the stage floor and most of the backdrops and set pieces leading to the cancellation of the production.

===Copyright release===
In 2011, the Really Useful Group (copyright owners of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;) released certain rights to the musical in celebration of its 25th anniversary. In March 2011 Reed-Custer High School in Braidwood, Illinois, became the first school to perform &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; under the new rights. Later in 2011, Stanwell School in Penarth became the first school in the UK to perform the show.

===North American Tour, 2025===
In November 2024, it was announced that the musical was set to embark on a multi-year tour beginning in November 2025 at the Hippodrome in Baltimore, Maryland. Further details, such as the cast and creative team, are yet to be announced.

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation, directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Gerard Butler as the Phantom, Emmy Rossum as Christine, Patrick Wilson as Raoul, Minnie Driver as Carlotta, and Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, opened on 22 December 2004 in the US.

Notes
==Orchestra==
The original orchestrations were written by David Cullen and Lloyd Webber.

There are several orchestrations:
*27-piece (the original score, used on Broadway and until 2020 in London, also used for the 2022 Australian production)
*29-piece (the original Broadway score)
*14-piece (used on tour, most international productions from 2012 onwards, the 2020 UK Tour and in London from 2021)
*45-piece (used for the 25th anniversary)

The original London score is as the Broadway score but with 1 percussion part and 7 violins. The current Broadway orchestration is licensed by R&amp;H Theatricals for amateur and professional productions. The only difference between the Broadway 29- and 27-piece orchestras is the smaller orchestra&#x27;s lack of Violins VII &amp; VIII.

The Broadway production originally used a 29-piece pit orchestra:

Percussion is split between two books – regular percussion and mallets:
* 2 timpani, suspended cymbals, crash cymbals, snare drum, triangle, tambourine, bass drum
* Glockenspiel, xylophone, vibes, marimba, tubular bells, bell tree, woodblock, gong, guiro, finger cymbals

==Recordings==
Cast recordings have been made of the London, Austrian, Dutch, German, Japanese, Swedish, Korean, Hungarian, Mexican, Polish, Russian and Canadian productions.

The recording of the 1986 original London cast, released by Polydor Records in 1987, was released in both a single-CD &quot;Highlights from The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and a two-CD &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;, both of which have been certified 4× Platinum in the US and sold 4.97 million copies as of January 2017. &quot;The Complete Recordings&quot; edition has sold 507,000 copies since 1991. &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was also certified 3× Platinum in the UK. The Canadian cast recording went 2× Platinum in Canada. In Switzerland, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was certified 3× Platinum and &quot;Highlights&quot; was certified 2× Platinum. Recordings of the Vienna cast and the Hamburg cast produced by Jimmy Bowien were certified Gold and triple Platinum, respectively, in Germany. The original album recording has sold an alleged 40 million copies worldwide.

A live recording of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; was released in the UK on 15 November 2011 and subsequently in the US and Canada on 7 February 2012, along with Blu-ray and DVD videos, and a collectors&#x27; box set of the Royal Albert concert, the original cast recording, and the sequel, &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;.

====&quot;Highlights from The Phantom of the Opera&quot;====


==Allegations of plagiarism==
In 1987, the heirs of Giacomo Puccini charged in a lawsuit that a recurring two-bar passage in &quot;Music of the Night&quot; closely resembled a similar phrase first heard in the aria &quot;Quello che tacete&quot; from Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;. The litigation was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

In 1990, a Baltimore songwriter named Ray Repp filed a lawsuit alleging that the title song from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was based on a song that he wrote in 1978 called &quot;Till You&quot;. After eight years of litigation – including an unsuccessful countersuit by Lloyd Webber claiming that &quot;Till You&quot; was itself a plagiarism of &quot;Close Every Door&quot; from &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; – the jury found in Lloyd Webber&#x27;s favour.

Former Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters has claimed that the signature descending/ascending half-tone chord progression from &quot;Phantom&#x27;s&quot; title song was plagiarised from the bass line of a track on the 1971 Pink Floyd album &quot;Meddle&quot; called &quot;Echoes&quot;. He avoided taking legal action, saying, &quot;Life&#x27;s too long to bother with suing Andrew fucking Lloyd Webber.&quot;

==Sequel==

The sequel to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, written by Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton, Frederick Forsyth and Glenn Slater, is called &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;. It was loosely adapted from the 1999 novel &quot;The Phantom of Manhattan&quot;, by Forsyth. Set in 1907 (a decade after the conclusion of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; according to the production&#x27;s announcement, but actually 26 years later, as the original show was set in 1881), Christine is invited to perform at Phantasma, a new attraction at Coney Island, by an anonymous impresario. With her husband Raoul and son Gustave in tow, she journeys to Brooklyn, unaware that it is the Phantom who has arranged her appearance at the popular beach resort.

The original production was directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with set and costume designs by Bob Crowley, and opened at the Adelphi Theatre in the West End starring Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess on 9 March 2010. Though it ran for over 17 months and closed on 27 August 2011, the production received mixed reviews. A scheduled Broadway opening in November 2010 was postponed until Spring 2011 and later cancelled. A revamped Australian production, starring Ben Lewis and Anna O&#x27;Byrne, opened 21 May 2011 at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne to more favourable notices. After the Melbourne run ended on 12 December 2011 the production moved to the Capitol Theatre in Sydney where it played from January to April 2012. A West End revival concert starring Norm Lewis and Celinde Schoenmaker at Theatre Royal Drury Lane ran 21 and 22 August 2023.

<doc id="308842" wikidata="Q737739" url="?curid=308842" title="Robert Muldoon">
<text>Sir Robert David Muldoon (; 25 September 19215 August 1992) was a New Zealand conservative politician who served as the 31st prime minister of New Zealand, from 1975 to 1984, while leader of the National Party. Departing from National Party convention, Muldoon was a right-wing populist and economic nationalist, with a distinctive public persona described as reactionary, aggressive, and abrasive.

After a troubled childhood, Muldoon served as a corporal and sergeant in the army in the Second World War. After a career as a cost accountant, he was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1960 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tamaki, representing the National Party. Muldoon rose in the Second National Government to serve successively as Minister of Tourism (1967), Minister of Finance (1967–1972), and Deputy Prime Minister (1972). Over this time he built up an informal but solid backing amongst National&#x27;s mostly rural right faction, which he called &quot;Rob&#x27;s Mob&quot;. After National lost the 1972 general election to the Labour Party, Muldoon used his connections to oust moderate party leader Jack Marshall and take his place, becoming Leader of the Opposition in 1974. Through Muldoon&#x27;s ideological blend of moderate social liberalism and protectionist right-wing populism (&quot;counterpunching&quot;, a term he coined) and the promise of a lucrative superannuation scheme, National enjoyed a resurgence. The early death of prime minister Norman Kirk severely weakened the Labour Party, and Muldoon soon led National to a decisive victory in the 1975 general election.

Muldoon came to power promising to lead &quot;a Government of the ordinary bloke&quot;. He appointed himself Minister of Finance. Although he used populist rhetoric to rail against elites and the political establishment, he consistently tried to centralise power under himself during his premiership. His tenure was plagued by an economic pattern of stagnation, high inflation, growing unemployment, and high external debts and borrowing. Economic policies of the Muldoon Government included national superannuation, wage and price freezes, industrial incentives, and the Think Big industrial projects. He reintroduced and intensified the previous government&#x27;s policies of the Dawn Raids, which racially targeted Pasifika overstayers. To engage with crime, Muldoon built &quot;unusually close relationships&quot; with criminal gangs; he personally favoured Black Power, and he and his wife Thea met with them on several occasions. In foreign policy, Muldoon adopted an anti-Soviet stance and re-emphasised New Zealand&#x27;s defence commitments to the United States and Australia under the ANZUS pact. His refusal to stop a Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand divided the country and led to unprecedented civil disorder in 1981. Muldoon became more and more controversial as his premiership progressed; in addition to the controversy of the Springbok tour, he began a smear campaign against Labour MP Colin Moyle for alleged illegal homosexual activities and punched demonstrators at a protest.

Muldoon led his party to two additional election victories in 1978 and 1981, with the first-past-the-post electoral system keeping him in power despite losing the popular vote in each election except 1975. At the 1984 snap election, which Muldoon infamously announced while intoxicated on live television, National finally suffered a significant defeat to Labour. Shortly before leaving office, amid a constitutional crisis, Muldoon was forced by the incoming Government to devalue the New Zealand dollar. In 1984, he was only the second prime minister (after Sir Keith Holyoake) to receive a knighthood while still in office. Mounting legal costs encouraged Muldoon to pursue a novelty acting career, but he remained in parliament until his retirement in 1992. He died shortly thereafter; the gang Black Power performed a haka at his funeral.

==Early life and family==
Robert David Muldoon was born in Auckland on 25 September 1921 to parents James Henry Muldoon and Amie Rusha Muldoon (&quot;née&quot; Browne). His father&#x27;s family, the Muldoon (Irish: &quot;Ó Maoldúin&quot;) family, were of Irish descent; his grandfather was an Irish-born Scouser who emigrated from Liverpool.

At the age of five, &#x27;Rob&#x27; Muldoon slipped while playing on the front gate, damaging his cheek and resulting in a distinctive lopsided smile that remained with him for life.

When Muldoon was aged eight, his father was admitted to Auckland Mental Hospital at Point Chevalier, where he died of parenchymatous syphilis nearly 20 years later in 1946. This left Muldoon&#x27;s mother to raise him on her own. During this time Muldoon came under the strong formative influence of his fiercely intelligent, iron-willed maternal grandmother Jerusha, a committed socialist. Though Muldoon never accepted her creed, he did develop under her influence a potent ambition, a consuming interest in politics, and an abiding respect for New Zealand&#x27;s welfare state. Muldoon won a scholarship to attend Mount Albert Grammar School from 1933 to 1936. He left school at age 15, finding work at Fletcher Construction and then the Auckland Electric Power Board as an arrears clerk. He studied accountancy by correspondence.
In 1951 Muldoon married Thea Dale Flyger, who he had met through the Junior Nationals. The couple had three children. Lady Muldoon, who died at age 87 in 2015, was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1993 New Year Honours and made a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order in the 1986 New Year Honours. Muldoon was protective of his family life and, in particular, his wife. He said that people could comment about him but his family was off limits.

Muldoon joined the New Zealand Military Forces in November 1940 during the Second World War, and served in the South Pacific with 37th Battalion. He was later sent to Italy and served with the same unit (Divisional Cavalry Regiment), as two other future National Party colleagues, Duncan MacIntyre and Jack Marshall. Muldoon completed his training as an accountant, sitting his final exams to become an accountant while in Italy, from Jack Marshall&#x27;s tent. Muldoon then worked in a chartered accountancy firm in the United Kingdom for a year. According to &quot;Muldoon&quot;, Muldoon&#x27;s 1977 autobiography, he returned to New Zealand after the war as the country&#x27;s first fully qualified cost accountant, though there are no other sources confirming this.

===Member of Parliament===





In March 1947 Muldoon joined the newly founded Mount Albert branch of the Junior Nationals, the youth wing of the conservative New Zealand National Party. He quickly became active in the party, making two sacrificial-lamb bids for Parliament against entrenched but vulnerable Labour incumbents in 1954 (Mount Albert) and 1957 (Waitemata). But in 1960 he won election as MP for the suburban Auckland electorate of Tamaki, winning against Bob Tizard, who had taken the former National seat in 1957. In 1960, an electoral swing brought Keith Holyoake back to power as Prime Minister of the Second National Government. Muldoon would represent the Tamaki constituency for the next 32 years.

Muldoon, along with Duncan MacIntyre and Peter Gordon who entered parliament in the same year, became known as the &quot;Young Turks&quot; (a for a group of young rebels) because of their criticism of the party&#x27;s senior leadership. From his early years as an MP, Muldoon became known as &quot;Piggy&quot;; the that would remain with him throughout his life even amongst those who were his supporters. Muldoon himself seemed to relish his controversial public profile.

Muldoon opposed both abortion and capital punishment. In 1961 he was one of ten National MPs to cross the floor and vote with the Opposition to remove capital punishment for murder from the Crimes Bill that the Second National Government had introduced. In 1977 he voted against the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 when the issue also came up as a conscience vote.

Muldoon was appointed in 1961 to the Public Accounts Committee, which in 1962 became the Public Expenditure Committee. He was well informed on all aspects of the government, and could participate in many debates in Parliament.

===Entry into Cabinet===
Muldoon displayed a flair for debate and a diligence in his backbench work. Following the re-election of Holyoake&#x27;s government at the 1963 general election, Muldoon was appointed as Under-Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Harry Lake. While holding this office, he took responsibility for the successful introduction of decimal currency into New Zealand. Initially there was some controversy over the design of the new coins and notes of the New Zealand dollar, but the issues were overcome in time for the new currency&#x27;s introduction in July 1967.

===Minister of Finance===

The Holyoake government was again re-elected at the 1966 general election. However, Muldoon was passed over as a new Cabinet minister following the election, with fellow Young Turks Duncan MacIntyre and Peter Gordon appointed ahead of him. Holyoake appointed Muldoon as Minister of Tourism and Minister Assistant to the Minister of Finance three months later.
When Harry Lake died suddenly of a heart attack in February 1967 (only days after Muldoon had joined the Cabinet), Prime Minister Keith Holyoake appointed Muldoon over Tom Shand (who himself died unexpectedly in December 1969) and Jack Marshall who had declined the post. Muldoon was to remain Minister of Finance for 14 of the next 17 years; at 45, he became the youngest Minister of Finance since the 1890s. At the time there was a serious economic crisis due to a down-turn in the price of wool.

In response to this crisis, Muldoon introduced mini-budgets instead of annual budgets, the first being presented on 4 May 1967. He cut and held public expenditure and increased indirect taxes to reduce demand. As a result, Muldoon was credited with the better economic performance New Zealand enjoyed, raising his profile among the public.

Muldoon established a considerable national profile rapidly; Holyoake would later credit his image, rather than that of his deputy, Jack Marshall, for the National Party&#x27;s surprise victory in the 1969 election. He displayed a flair for the newly introduced medium of television (broadcasts began in New Zealand in 1960).

===Deputy Prime Minister===
When Holyoake stood down in 1972, Muldoon challenged Marshall for the top job; he lost by a narrow margin, but won unanimous election as deputy leader of the National Party and hence Deputy Prime Minister.

Marshall fought the 1972 election on a slogan of &quot;Man For Man, The Strongest Team&quot; – an allusion to Marshall&#x27;s own low-key style, particularly compared to his deputy. Muldoon commented on Labour&#x27;s election promises with &quot;They can&#x27;t promise anything because I&#x27;ve spent it all&quot;. Labour, led by the charismatic Norman Kirk, was swept into office, ending 12 years in power for National.

==Leader of the Opposition==
Many members of the party caucus regarded Marshall as not up to the task of taking on the formidable new Prime Minister Norman Kirk. In July 1974, less than a year before a statutory general election, the caucus voted to hold a new leadership election. Marshall resigned after longtime colleague George Gair told him he stood no chance in a leadership vote, and Muldoon was elected unopposed as Leader of the Opposition on 9 July 1974. A day later, Muldoon&#x27;s first autobiography, &quot;The Rise and Fall of a Young Turk&quot;, was published. The book was to be reprinted four times and sell 28,000 copies. Muldoon mastered television and packed public meetings with loyal supporters dubbed &quot;Rob&#x27;s Mob&quot;, who included many blue collar conservatives.
Muldoon relished the opportunity to match up against Kirk – but had it for only a short time, until Kirk&#x27;s sudden unexpected death on 31 August 1974. Kirk was replaced as prime minister by Bill Rowling shortly afterwards. In the 1975 election, National ran on a platform of &quot;New Zealand – The Way &quot;YOU&quot; Want It&quot;, a slogan Muldoon came up with himself. He promised a generous national superannuation scheme to replace Kirk and Rowling&#x27;s employer-contribution superannuation scheme (which the famous &quot;Dancing Cossacks&quot; television advertisement implied would turn New Zealand into a communist state), and promised to fix New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;shattered economy&quot;. Labour responded with a campaign called Citizens for Rowling, described by Muldoon as &quot;not even a thinly disguised&quot; attack on himself. At the election, Muldoon overwhelmed Rowling, reversing the 55-32 Labour majority to a 55–32 National majority.

==Prime Minister (1975–1984)==

===First term: 1975–1978===

Muldoon was sworn in as New Zealand&#x27;s 31st Prime Minister on 12 December 1975, at the age of 54. A populist, he promised to lead &quot;a Government of the ordinary bloke&quot;. His government immediately faced problems with the economy; a recession from June 1976 to March 1978 caused New Zealand&#x27;s economy to shrink 4.1% and unemployment to rise 125%.

====Superannuation and Fitzgerald v. Muldoon====
One of Muldoon&#x27;s first actions was to issue a press release stating that he would advise the Governor-General to abolish Labour&#x27;s superannuation scheme without new legislation. Muldoon felt that the dissolution would be immediate, and he would later introduce a bill in parliament to retroactively make the abolition legal. The Bill of Rights 1689 was then invoked in the case of &quot;Fitzgerald v Muldoon and Others&quot;, The Chief Justice, Sir Richard Wild, declared that Muldoon&#x27;s actions were illegal as they had violated Article 1 of the Bill of Rights, which provides &quot;that the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority...is illegal.&quot; Ultimately Muldoon, as a member of the executive branch, was acting beyond his prescribed powers, as only parliament has the power to make and unmake laws. Therefore, Muldoon&#x27;s actions were not only illegal, but unconstitutional, as they violated the rule of law and the sovereignty of parliament. This is incapsulated in Sir Richard Wild&#x27;s judgment, in which he stated that &quot;The Act of Parliament in force required that those deductions and contributions must be made, yet here was the Prime Minister announcing that they need not be made. I am bound to hold that in so doing he was purporting to suspend the law without consent of Parliament. Parliament had made the law. Therefore the law could be amended or suspended only by Parliament or with the authority of Parliament.&quot;

Economics correspondent Brian Gaynor has claimed that Muldoon&#x27;s policy of reversing Labour&#x27;s saving scheme cost him a chance to transform the New Zealand economy. The National superannuation scheme was one of Muldoon&#x27;s 1975 election promises: it was described as a &quot;generous&quot; policy, and was effective in realigning Muldoon&#x27;s support from elderly voters. However, the high cost of the scheme had an immense impact on the budget; Margaret McClure determined that the scheme&#x27;s superannuation was substantially higher than that of similar policies elsewhere in the world. The United States&#x27; superannuation for a married couple was effectively 49% of the average wage rate, and 40% in Australia and 38% in Britain; however, New Zealand&#x27;s was set at 80%. Therefore, by 1981 the spending on this scheme had doubled, and made up 17.3% of the government&#x27;s budget. This resulted in other social policy programs, particularly education, being deprived of funds during this period. Justice Stephen Kós has also stated that the &quot;increase, without contribution, was utterly unsustainable.&quot;

====Economic challenges====
Muldoon&#x27;s government inherited a number of economic and social challenges. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, New Zealand&#x27;s economy had significantly declined due to several international developments: a decline in international wool prices in 1966, Britain joining the European Economic Community in 1973 (which deprived New Zealand of its formerly most important export market), and the 1973 oil crisis. The &quot;Muldoon Years&quot; were to feature Muldoon&#x27;s obstinate and resourceful attempts to maintain New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;cradle to the grave&quot; welfare state, dating from 1935, in the face of a changing world. Muldoon had remained National&#x27;s Finance spokesman when he became party leader, and as a result became his own Minister of Finance when National won power in 1975—thus concentrating enormous power in his hands. He is the last to hold both posts .

In his first term (1975–1978) Muldoon focused on reducing expenditure, but struggled with the growing cost of his own superannuation scheme, partly due to the many tax rebates and exemptions he passed for lower income earners. By March 1978 the economy was growing again, but unemployment and inflation remained high.

====The Dawn Raids====

Robert Muldoon continued his Labour predecessor Prime Minister Norman Kirk&#x27;s policy of arresting and deporting Pacific Islander overstayers which had begun in 1974. Since the 1950s, the New Zealand government had encouraged substantial emigration from several Pacific countries including Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji to fill a labour shortage caused by the post–war economic boom. Consequently, the Pacific Islander population in New Zealand had grown to 45,413 by 1971, with a substantial number overstaying their visas. The economic crisis of the early 1970s led to increased crime, unemployment and other social ailments, which disproportionately involved the Pacific Islander community.

In July 1974, Muldoon as opposition leader had promised to cut immigration and to &quot;get tough&quot; on law and order issues. He claimed that the Labour government&#x27;s immigration policies had contributed to the economic recession and undermined the &quot;New Zealand way of life&quot; by causing a housing shortage. During the 1975 general elections, the National Party had played a controversial electoral advertisement that was later criticised for stoking negative racial sentiments about Polynesian migrants. Muldoon&#x27;s government accelerated and increased the Kirk government&#x27;s police raids against Pacific overstayers. These operations involved special police squads conducting dawn raids on the homes of overstayers throughout New Zealand. Overstayers and their families were usually deported to their countries of origin.

The Dawn Raids were widely condemned by various sections of New Zealand society, including the Pacific Islander and Māori communities, church groups, employers and workers&#x27; unions, anti-racist groups, and the opposition Labour Party. The raids were also criticised by elements of the New Zealand Police and the ruling National Party for damaging relations with the Pacific Islander community. At the time, Pacific Islanders comprised only one third of the overstayers (who were primarily from the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa), but made up 86% of those arrested and prosecuted for overstaying. The Muldoon government&#x27;s treatment of overstayers also damaged relations with Pacific countries like Samoa and Tonga, and generated criticism from the South Pacific Forum. By 1979, the Muldoon government terminated the Dawn Raids, concluding that they had failed to alleviate the economic problems.

====Moyle Affair====

Muldoon, in Parliament, accused opposition MP and former Cabinet minister Colin Moyle in November 1976 of having been questioned by the police on suspicion of homosexual activities a year earlier. Homosexual activity between men was illegal in New Zealand at the time. After changing his story several times, Moyle resigned from Parliament. He later said that he had not been obliged to resign, but had done so because &quot;the whole thing just made me sick&quot;. It has been suggested that Muldoon saw him as a leadership threat and acted accordingly. In a 1990 interview, Moyle said that the scandal had made him a &quot;sadder and wiser person&quot;. The head of the prime minister&#x27;s department, Gerald Hensley, wrote that Muldoon had told later him outing Moyle was the thing he regretted most in his life.

The subsequent was won by David Lange, and the attention that this got him helped propel Lange to the leadership of the Labour Party and his landslide victory over Muldoon in the 1984 election.

====Appointment of Holyoake as Governor-General====

As prime minister, Muldoon had the sole right to advise Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, on whom to appoint as governor-general. With the term of Sir Denis Blundell as Governor-General coming to an end in 1977, a new appointee was needed. Muldoon sent a message to the Queen on 15 December 1976 putting forward former prime minister Sir Keith Holyoake as his appointee, which the Queen approved. The announcement was made by the Queen at the end of her tour of New Zealand on 7 March 1977, from the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; in Lyttelton Harbour.

This choice was controversial because Holyoake was a sitting Cabinet minister. Both opponents and supporters of Muldoon&#x27;s government claimed that it was a political appointment; a number of National MPs, including his deputy, disagreed with the precedent of having a politician as Governor-General. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Rowling complained that he had not been consulted on the appointment, and then stated that he would act to remove Holyoake as Governor-General should the Labour Party win the 1978 general election. As a result of the appointment, Holyoake resigned from Parliament, resulting in the Pahiatua by-election of 1977. He was succeeded in his seat by John Falloon.

====1978 election====

A month before the general election Muldoon remained the preferred prime minister, though his support slipped from 60% to 48% while Rowling&#x27;s rose 8 points to 38%. At the election, held on 25 November, National lost three seats and it dropped 7.9 percentage points in the vote. Although the party had been returned to office with a majority of seats, it had lost the popular vote to a resurgent Labour Party. National Party President George Chapman argued National struggled at the election because of the many boundary changes and issues with the electoral roll, contrary to Muldoon&#x27;s claims that the media going against National had caused the decline in support.

===Second term: 1978–1981===
====Taxation====
Muldoon initially opposed indirect consumer taxation on the basis that it would penalise poor people and increase inflation due to compensatory wage increases. However, in May 1979 he attempted to increase tax revenue by levying 10% to 20% taxes on a wide range of goods, including petrol, lawnmowers, caravans and boats. The taxes were criticised for being discriminatory, ineffective, and a &quot;quick fix&quot; that precluded necessary fundamental reform of the taxation system (as there were no income tax cuts to reflect the shift to indirect taxation). The boat and caravan levies, in particular, crippled both industries, as potential buyers could not afford the 20% tax on top of the construction costs, resulting in additional unemployment as workers were laid off.

====Communism and the Soviet Union====
As with other conservative governments during the Cold War, Muldoon adopted an anti-Soviet stance. As a long-time National Party activist, Muldoon rejected Communism as an &quot;alien&quot; collectivist philosophy. During the television programme &quot;Gallery&quot; in the later 1960s, he also rebuked left-leaning clergymen who had criticised apartheid in South Africa for failing to oppose Soviet communism. Muldoon was critical of Communist influence in New Zealand&#x27;s trade union movement. He also viewed the Moscow-aligned Socialist Unity Party (SUP), a break-away faction from the Communist Party of New Zealand, as a Soviet fifth column that was trying to subvert New Zealand and the South Pacific island states. In various speeches and press releases, he would accuse the SUP and other Communist groups of instigating strikes and organising protests against US naval visits and New Zealand&#x27;s sporting contacts with South Africa.

As prime minister, he accepted both the American and Chinese views that the Soviet Union was an aggressive power with hegemonic ambitions in the South Pacific. Muldoon would also join the United States President Jimmy Carter and other Western leaders in condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics. However, his government did not participate in the US-led trade boycott against the Soviet Union because it would have hurt New Zealand&#x27;s predominantly agricultural export economy. In 1980, the National government also expelled the Soviet Ambassador, Vsevolod Sofinski, for providing funding to the SUP. Despite his antagonism towards the Soviet Union and domestic Communist movements, Muldoon&#x27;s government still maintained economic relations with the Soviet Union.

====Arthur Allan Thomas====

After David Yallop drew Muldoon&#x27;s attention to the case of Arthur Allan Thomas, twice convicted for the murders of farming couple Harvey and Jeannette Crewe, Muldoon asked Robert Adams-Smith, a QC, to review the case. Adams-Smith reported &#x27;an injustice may have been done&#x27;, and Muldoon pushed through a royal pardon for Thomas. A subsequent Royal Commission of Inquiry exonerated Thomas and recommended he be paid $950,000 as compensation for the time he served.
====East Coast Bays by-election====

Muldoon&#x27;s appointment of Frank Gill as New Zealand&#x27;s ambassador to the United States led to a by-election in Gill&#x27;s seat of East Coast Bays. Muldoon&#x27;s favoured candidate was Sue Wood, at the time National&#x27;s Vice President and later party President. National selected the economically liberal Don Brash, a future Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and later leader of the National Party, as its candidate. Brash lost the by-election to Social Credit&#x27;s Gary Knapp, a major upset and a blow for Muldoon&#x27;s leadership. Muldoon blamed Brash and the party organisation for the defeat, but was strongly rebuked by the party for this stance. The loss of the by-election provided the catalyst for growing opposition within the National Party to Muldoon&#x27;s leadership.

====Colonels&#x27; Coup====
Following the loss of the East Coast Bays by-election, Muldoon faced an abortive attempt in October–November 1980 to oust him as leader. Known as the Colonels&#x27; Coup after its originators—Jim Bolger, Jim McLay and Derek Quigley—it aimed to replace Muldoon with his more economically liberal deputy, Brian Talboys. Muldoon, who was overseas at the time, saw the plotters off with relative ease, especially since Talboys himself was a reluctant draftee. No other serious challenge to his leadership occurred in his years as prime minister until after the 1984 election.

====Springbok Tour====
Professing a belief that politics should not interfere with sport, Muldoon resisted pressure to bar the 1981 tour by the Springboks, the national rugby union squad of &quot;apartheid&quot;-era South Africa. By allowing &quot;the Tour&quot;, Muldoon was accused of breaking the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement (to form a common policy on sporting with South Africa amongst the Commonwealth, signed after the boycott of the Montreal Olympics in 1976). Muldoon noted, however, that the Gleneagles Agreement had been amended and, in an article in &quot;The Times&quot;, that he had not broken the Gleneagles Agreement because &quot;New Zealand and subsequently other countries made it clear that they could not subscribe to an agreement which required them to abrogate the freedoms of their sportsmen and prohibit sporting contacts&quot;. &quot;The Tour&quot;, as it has become known, provoked massive public demonstrations and some of the worst social schisms New Zealand has ever seen. Muldoon came down firmly on the pro-Tour side, arguing that sport and politics should be kept separate. He argued that his refusal to ban the Springboks was anti-authoritarian, leaving it up to individual consciences whether to play sports with representatives of apartheid. He also argued that allowing their rugby team to tour did not mean supporting apartheid, any more than playing a Soviet Union team meant supporting Communism.

====Think Big====
The Iranian Revolution had led to the second oil shock of 1979. Economic growth in New Zealand had only just begun to recover from the 1976–78 recession when the oil shock hit. Economic pressures continued to build: Muldoon tried to control spiraling increases in wages and inflation through a trade-off with the trade-union leadership: a reduction in the tax rate in exchange for an agreement not to press for further rounds of wage increases, similar to The Accord reached in Australia in 1983. The Federation of Labour&#x27;s President Jim Knox, who Muldoon did not get along with, refused to co-operate. In response, Muldoon introduced his Think Big strategy, in which the government borrowed heavily to invest in large-scale industrial projects, predominantly energy-related. The projects&#x27; goals were to make New Zealand more than 60% self-sufficient in energy, and to produce 425,000 jobs. The Clyde dam, which generated electricity to be used to manufacture aluminium for export, was typical of Muldoon&#x27;s efforts to shelter New Zealand from the troubles of the rest of the world. This dam was described to symbolise &quot;fortress New Zealand&quot;.

The Think Big projects were a major part of Muldoon&#x27;s legacy. However, when presenting the idea to the public, Muldoon vastly exaggerated their benefits. Many projects had severe budget overruns of as much as ten times their expected costs. This soon worsened the balance of payments deficit and inflation, as all of the equipment and technology used was imported. As a result of increased oil prices, a decline in New Zealand&#x27;s terms of trade, and less than expected returns from the Think Big projects, Muldoon was forced to borrow more money. Despite Muldoon&#x27;s promise before the 1975 election to erase debt, the already high levels of debt remained. The advisability of the Think Big projects remains controversial.

Concerned about the use of foreign exchange during the 1970s&#x27; oil crises, Muldoon supported a scheme to retrofit cars to use natural gas or a dual-fuel gas–petrol system. The 1979 budget introduced incentives for the conversions, and New Zealand emerged as the first country to make dual-fuel cars commonplace. However, the projected continued rise in oil prices did not transpire.

==== 1981 election ====

Despite the turmoil over the Springbok Tour, Muldoon&#x27;s Government won the subsequent 1981 election, held on 28 November. On the night, National won 46 seats to Labour&#x27;s 44 and Social Credit&#x27;s two, but a recount gave National the seat of Gisborne by 150 votes, and a majority of one. Muldoon had to be persuaded not to make the Springbok Tour an issue in the election, and the National Party&#x27;s campaign instead focused on Think Big. Again, Muldoon&#x27;s Government received fewer votes than the opposition Labour Party.

===Third term: 1981–1984 ===

Muldoon&#x27;s third term was tumultuous. With a one-seat majority he faced an increasingly restless backbench who wanted the National Party to adopt a more economically liberal stance. Early in 1982 Derek Quigley, a junior minister who had been demoted for his role in the Colonel&#x27;s Coup of 1980, spoke out against Think Big, casting doubts on its benefits. As a result, Muldoon asked him to apologise or resign from Cabinet; Quigley chose to resign. Muldoon had also fallen out with former supporter and millionaire businessman Bob Jones, who made good on a threat to create his own party in protest at Muldoon&#x27;s economic policies. In 1983 the New Zealand Party was formed by Jones and took a significant share of the vote at the 1984 election.

==== Economic recession and wage and price freeze ====
With Think Big failing to deliver on its promise, Muldoon imposed an incomes policy: a freeze on wages and most prices (items excluded included fresh meat, frozen meat, items sold at auction and &quot;women&#x27;s fashion clothing other than standard lines&quot;), interest rates and dividends across the country in April 1982. Against this he offered a &quot;sweetener&quot; of a tax cut which cost the New Zealand treasury approximately a billion New Zealand dollars. Ultimately the Wage and Price Freeze, which had been intended only to last for a year, remained in force for nearly two years and was repealed by the incoming Labour Government. Years later, Muldoon admitted that the freeze was a political mistake.

The second recession during Muldoon&#x27;s premiership hit in September 1982. New Zealand&#x27;s economy contracted again by 3% and unemployment hit 5.1% by 1983, and net emigration remained high.

====Falklands War====
In 1982, Muldoon&#x27;s government supported the British in the Falklands War. While New Zealand did not directly participate in the conflict, Muldoon undertook to send the frigates HMNZS &quot;Canterbury&quot; and HMNZS &quot;Waikato&quot; to the Indian Ocean to relieve Royal Navy frigates, so that they could in their turn deploy in the conflict. New Zealand also broke off its diplomatic relations with Argentina. In defence of his support for the war, Muldoon wrote an article that was published in &quot;The Times&quot;, entitled &quot;Why we Stand by our Mother Country&quot;:

We are a free and independent nation but in time of trouble we stand with our mother country...New Zealand&#x27;s decision to break off diplomatic relations with Argentina over the Falklands, immediately after Britain had done so, was not because of Britain&#x27;s support on the sporting issue. The reason goes much deeper than that. It is in the context of the statement made by a Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand in 1939: &quot;Where Britain goes, we go.&quot; We see the Falklands as British territory and the Falklands Islanders as subjects of our Queen. We live at the end of the line and we know the feeling of isolation...With the Falklands Islands, it is family. Historically, Britain has so often on great occasions thrown up the leader that the occasion demanded. I regard Margaret Thatcher as one of the finest and straightest politicians I have ever met...In 1939 we learned the folly of appeasement. A great catastrophe was the price that was paid. The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased. New Zealand will back Britain all the way.

In the British House of Commons, Margaret Thatcher responded by saying that &quot;The New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support of this country, of the Falkland Islanders and of the rule of liberty and the rule of law. I shall gladly convey that to Mr. Muldoon, who, only yesterday, reminded me &#x27;Don&#x27;t forget. In New Zealand, we are still a member of the same family.

====Closer Economic Relations====

Muldoon initiated a Closer Economic Relations (CER) free trade agreement with Australia to liberalise trade, which came into effect from New Year&#x27;s Day 1982. The aim of total free trade between the two countries was achieved in 1990, five years ahead of schedule.

====Nuclear ships policy and the snap election of 1984====

Ultimately, the end of Muldoon&#x27;s government came following a late-night clash with National backbencher Marilyn Waring over highly contentious Opposition-sponsored nuclear-free New Zealand legislation, in which Waring told him she would cross the floor (giving the Opposition a victory). On 14 June 1984, a visibly drunk Muldoon called a a snap election for 14 July that same year; historians noted the unfortunate coincidence with Bastille Day. A journalist commented that a one-month election campaign would not give Muldoon much time to which Muldoon replied, audibly slurring his words, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t give my opponents much time to run up to an election, does it?&quot;. Six days before the election, a televised leader&#x27;s debate was held between Muldoon and David Lange where Muldoon, irritated by Lange&#x27;s magnanimous closing words to him, sarcastically finished the debate by saying &quot;I love you, Mr Lange&quot;. Muldoon was heavily defeated by Lange&#x27;s resurgent Labour Party, which won 56 seats to National&#x27;s 37 with massive vote splitting caused by the New Zealand Party in particular. Muldoon&#x27;s drunkenness when announcing the election date led to it being humorously called the &quot;schnapps election&quot;.

It is a strong convention in New Zealand politics that a prime minister does not ask for an early election unless he or she cannot govern, or unless they need to seek the electorate&#x27;s endorsement on a matter of national importance (as was the case in 1951). Muldoon justified the snap election because he felt Waring&#x27;s revolt impeded his ability to govern. Indeed, it was obvious that Muldoon was finding it hard to pass financial measures with neo-liberal rebels like Ruth Richardson and Derek Quigley voting against the Government on certain issues. However, Waring said that she would not have denied Muldoon confidence or supply. This has led historians to question Muldoon&#x27;s excuse for calling a snap election, since he still would have had the constitutional means to govern.

==== Relationship with foreign leaders ====
Muldoon had several close relationships with foreign leaders, such as British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, American President Ronald Reagan, Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. These ranged from being positive to being stricken with deep animosity.

Despite both being from conservative parties (the Liberal Party of Australia and the New Zealand National Party), the relationship Muldoon had with Malcolm Fraser was unusually poor; largely due to Muldoon, they never got along. This paralleled the mutual dislike previous left-leaning Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam (Australian Labor Party) and Norman Kirk (New Zealand Labour Party) had for each other. Whitlam and Kirk had both become prime minister in 1972 after a lengthy period of conservative rule, but their governments lasted just one term. Both Fraser and Muldoon became prime minister in 1975, returning right-wing governance to Australasia. With their ideological preferences notwithstanding, the two men did not like each other from very early on, and grew to loathe one another to an undiplomatic degree. This was likely entirely caused, and then exacerbated, by Muldoon&#x27;s animosity toward Fraser. The elder statesman, Muldoon was blatantly patronising and rude to Fraser, and even bullied him on repetitive occasions. He also made bigoted remarks towards Australians in Fraser&#x27;s company, and was known to repeatedly claim that New Zealanders migrating to Australia &quot;raised the IQ of both countries&quot;. Muldoon often boasted to Fraser about the slow and costly process of Australia importing New Zealand goods, claiming on one occasion that New Zealand had &quot;screwed the Aussies again&quot; and would always get the upper hand. Even when negotiating and agreeing to Closer Economic Relations (CER), the most sweeping free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand ever signed up to that point, Muldoon and Fraser refused to engage directly. Their relationship reached a nadir in 1982, during the Pacific Islands Forum in Rotorua. Both men were staying at the same hotel, with Muldoon&#x27;s room directly below Fraser&#x27;s. According to future Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer, then a political aide, Fraser snapped and physically lost his temper during a late night policy meeting. Downer recalled in 2003 that the usually patient Fraser suddenly began jumping up and down and swearing loudly &quot;in the hope that he would wake Sir Robert from his sleep, just for the sake of it&quot;.

Despite Muldoon&#x27;s tactless behaviour, Fraser harboured gratitude for him out of his belief that Muldoon had saved his life in 1978. According to Fraser himself, this was because Muldoon had inadvertently prevented Fraser from being killed in the 1978 Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing. The hotel was the venue for the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting, a regional offshoot of the biennial meetings of the heads of government from across the Commonwealth of Nations. Fraser recalled that Muldoon had demanded that Fraser change the meeting venue in the hotel from the front to the back, to avoid a group of young, female reproductive rights protestors. They had travelled especially from New Zealand for the event, to demonstrate against Muldoon&#x27;s refusal to legalise abortion. Fraser, likely considering how Muldoon had physically attacked political demonstrators before, understood that giving him a hostile welcome would be a poor decision. Arguing that it would not look good and could likely provoke New Zealand, he agreed to move the meeting place to the back entrance. Doing so moved Fraser, other leaders and the media away from the original entrance, where that night, a bomb exploded in a bin that was being emptied, killing two rubbish collectors and a policeman. Malcolm Fraser and others theorised that the bomb was planted out the front to assassinate Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai (although this was never proven) and that if he had walked down to greet Desai as he exited his vehicle at the original entry point, the bomb would likely have been triggered, exploding and killing them both. He later told &quot;The Australian&quot; in 2009: &quot;I really believe to this day that, in a weird way, Morarji Desai and I probably owe our lives to Robert Muldoon.&quot;

Despite Fraser&#x27;s unwilling gratitude to Muldoon, the two men seemed to dislike each other so much by 1983 that when the time came to ratify CER, they refused to do it together. Instead, the deal was signed by the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and Minister for Trade, Lionel Bowen and the New Zealand High Commissioner to Australia, Laurie Francis.

====Foreign exchange and constitutional crises====

A final controversy occurred during the course of the election and transfer of government: during early 1984 Roderick Deane, then Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, became concerned that the New Zealand dollar (which had a fixed exchange-rate to the US dollar) had become significantly overvalued and was vulnerable to currency speculation on the financial markets in the event of a &quot;significant political event&quot;. This was exacerbated by media speculation following a leak that an incoming Labour administration would be likely to significantly devalue the NZ dollar upon election. The Reserve Bank counselled Muldoon that the dollar should be devalued. Muldoon ignored the advice, owing to his belief that it would hurt poor New Zealanders in the medium term, and in June 1984 announced the snap election mentioned above which, as predicted, caused an immediate run on the dollar.

Following the election the controversy became a constitutional crisis: Muldoon refused to do as the incoming government instructed, causing the currency crisis to worsen. Eventually he relented however, after his position as leader of the National party was threatened by members of his caucus.

After nine years, Muldoon&#x27;s stewardship of the nation and its economy ceased. The newly elected neo-liberal and unexpectedly pro-free market Fourth Labour Government embarked on a series of fundamental free-market reforms known (after Labour&#x27;s finance minister Roger Douglas) as Rogernomics, and which were then continued from 1990–94 by the succeeding National government&#x27;s policies known as (after National&#x27;s finance minister Ruth Richardson) as Ruthanasia, which marked a fundamental break with the more interventionist policies of Muldoon&#x27;s era.

===Honours===
Muldoon was appointed an Additional Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1977 Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1984 New Year Honours. He was only the second New Zealand Prime Minister (after Sir Keith Holyoake) to receive a knighthood while still in office; at the time he said, &quot;If anyone thought it was a signal of an early retirement, it is not.&quot;

==Later life==
Muldoon was deposed as National leader shortly after the election by his deputy, Jim McLay. After being defeated in the ballot Muldoon was asked whether he was going to be a thorn in McLay&#x27;s side, to which he replied &quot;More like a little prick.&quot; He refused McLay&#x27;s offer of a front bench post, instead opting to return to the backbench for the first time in over two decades. However, he continued to openly agitate against McLay, refusing to withdraw into an &quot;elder statesman&quot; role as McLay wanted. The relationship between the two bottomed out when Muldoon criticised the entire party leadership, forcing McLay to demote him to the lowest rank in the National caucus.

Muldoon continued to undermine McLay until 1986, when McLay was ousted in turn by his own deputy (and Muldoon&#x27;s preferred candidate), Jim Bolger, who had served as Minister of Labour for the latter half of Muldoon&#x27;s term as prime minister. Bolger returned Muldoon to the front bench as spokesperson for Foreign Affairs, pitting him directly against Prime Minister David Lange.

Muldoon remained as the MP for Tamaki until shortly before his death. He lived through the Fourth Labour Government&#x27;s neo-liberal reforms, known as &quot;Rogernomics&quot;, and to his dismay – to see his own man, Bolger, take up the same baton after winning the landslide election of 1990 in the form of &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;, named after Finance Minister Ruth Richardson. Muldoon was a staunch critic of Richardson&#x27;s and the Bolger government&#x27;s policies.

Muldoon also opposed the legalisation of homosexual behaviour when Labour MP Fran Wilde introduced the Homosexual Law Reform Bill in 1985. The Bill passed as the Homosexual Law Reform Act in 1986.

Although he remained iconic to particular segments of society, particularly the elderly, Muldoon faded quickly as a force on the political scene. His biographer, Barry Gustafson, who described himself as not a Muldoon supporter, wrote that he still served as an active MP for his Tamaki electorate, dealing immediately with matters from all walks of life. He continued to write in international economic journals, arguing that the unemployment that had arisen as a result of the free market reforms was worse than the gains that were made, a view that came to be popular by the time of the Fifth Labour Government in 1999.

=== Financial troubles, media career, and split from National ===
After his tenure as prime minister, the Muldoons were heavily in debt. Muldoon was furious with New Zealand Party founder Bob Jones for splitting the vote in 1984; Muldoon labelled Jones a spoiler and took him to court. A series of court battles with the millionaire, in which each sued the other for defamation, had left Muldoon with considerable legal fees to pay. As a result of his financial desperation, he capitalised on his abrasive persona by having a short stage career, appearing in a New Zealand production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show.&quot; Held at Auckland&#x27;s His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre (demolished soon after the production ended), Muldoon played off his novelty and starred as the narrator, starring alongside a young Russell Crowe, then going by the stage name of &quot;Russ Le Roq&quot;. He also had minor television appearances on commercials for Panasonic (when it changed its brand name in New Zealand from &quot;National&quot;) and in the television series &quot;Terry and the Gunrunners&quot; (as Arnos Grove) and in &quot;The Friday Frights&quot; (as the vampiric host &#x27;Count Robula&#x27;); he also hosted a talkback radio show entitled &quot;Lilies and Other Things&quot;, referencing his favourite flower on Radio Pacific.

In his later years Muldoon&#x27;s health declined as he suffered from a number of ailments, and became increasingly opposed to his successor, Jim Bolger. Alienated from National and disenchanted with government&#x27;s new neoliberal economic policies (dubbed &quot;Ruthanasia&quot; after Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson), Muldoon announced his resignation to the party caucus on 10 November 1991.

On his Radio Pacific show, on 17 November 1991, Muldoon announced he would stand down from Parliament; he formally retired one month later, on 17 December. His retirement party featured taped speeches from Ronald Reagan (commenting that at Muldoon&#x27;s age, he was only getting started) and Margaret Thatcher. One of the people organising the party was Bob Jones, who had forgiven Muldoon for their previous falling out. A by-election was held in February 1992, and was won by National&#x27;s Clem Simich on a reduced majority.

=== Death ===
Muldoon fell seriously ill almost immediately after his retirement, and died in hospital on 5 August 1992, aged 70. He is buried at Purewa Cemetery, Meadowbank, Auckland, in a plot that faces Auckland CBD. His wife, Dame Thea Muldoon, died on 24 February 2015, at the age of 87.

==Public image and legacy==

Muldoon was a polarising figure while in power, and remains one to this day. During his time in power he regularly eschewed formality, which included punching political demonstrators and stripping naked at a cocktail party. Praised for his populist appeal, he shaped his reputation as a rough, tough, and thoroughly cantankerous politician through his self-determination, even at the risk of his own political longevity. He became the first prime minister to use television as a medium to gain widespread support, and eagerly used it to attack and insult his opponents. Muldoon openly used homophobic language, and he refused to legalise male homosexual activity and abortion, both crimes at the time. However, after the &quot;New Zealand Truth&quot; attempted to out his youngest MP Marilyn Waring, the 26-year-old Baby of the House, Muldoon moved swiftly to minimise publicity and protect her.

Muldoon famously declared upon becoming prime minister that he hoped to leave New Zealand &quot;no worse off than I found it&quot;. Historians such as Gustafson and Brian Easton criticise Muldoon because, according to them, he pursued an ultimately unsustainable line of policy. Former Cabinet Minister Hugh Templeton argued Muldoon&#x27;s lack of &quot;strategic vision&quot; denied New Zealand a careful, measured economic restructuring that paved the way for Rogernomics.

Muldoon enjoyed engaging positively with criminal gangs such as Black Power, and made uncouth public statements that emphasised &quot;blokeiness&quot;. Both his physical appearance (with his distinctive facial scar) and personal style led to the nicknames &quot;Scarface&quot; and &quot;Piggy&quot; – both of which he appropriated himself. Muldoon became patron of the Black Power gang for whom he had created work schemes and advised on the better treatment of women and children associated with the gang. Members paid him solemn respect by performing a haka during his funeral in 1992. For his acrimonious behaviour he was also dubbed a &quot;bully&quot;, and posthumously he was said to have &quot;run the country like a gang&quot; himself.

Muldoon&#x27;s shunning of intellectualism in favour of intimidating, raging against so-called &quot;elites&quot;, and blatant, manipulative populism has led him to be called a forerunner to the likes of Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson and Silvio Berlusconi. Both Muldoon and Trump pursued populist protectionist methods aimed at creating both full employment and self-sufficiency and promoted anti-immigration policies, while demonstrating aggressive and tactless personal behaviour.

===In popular culture===

* Muldoon was frequently lampooned in the TVNZ-produced satire show &quot;McPhail &amp; Gadsby&quot; during the 1980s.
* American President Ronald Reagan would sometimes mistake the last name of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to be Muldoon after changes in government in both New Zealand and Canada in 1984, with many Canadian political cartoonists taking up on this error and referring to Mulroney as &#x27;Muldoon&#x27;.
* In 1995, actor Ian Mune played Sir Robert Muldoon in the made-for-television mini-series &quot;Fallout&quot;, depicting the end of the Muldoon National Government.
* A corner on the Remutaka Hill Road section of State Highway 2 has been named after the former prime minister. Safety work carried out between 2009 and 2012, costing NZ$16.5 million, included realignment to ease the corner.
* On 8 January 1977 when he was at Piha Beach for the re-opening of the Piha Surf Life Saving Club club-house after the Project 40 rebuild, he joined the Auckland Rescue Helicopter lifeguards jumping into the surf from the helicopter. He was lifted out of the water and transported back to the beach slung under the helicopter using the rescue strop connected into the cargo hook.

<doc id="308844" wikidata="Q625316" url="?curid=308844" title="Tangiwai disaster">
<text>The Tangiwai disaster was a deadly railway accident that occurred at 10:21 p.m. on 24 December 1953, when a railway bridge over the Whangaehu River collapsed beneath an express passenger train at Tangiwai, North Island, New Zealand. The locomotive and the first six carriages derailed into the river, killing 151 people. The subsequent board of inquiry found that the accident was caused by the failure of the tephra dam holding back nearby Mount Ruapehu&#x27;s crater lake, creating a rapid mudflow (lahar) in the Whangaehu River which destroyed one of the bridge piers at Tangiwai only minutes before the train reached the bridge. The volcano at Mount Ruapehu was not erupting at the time. The disaster remains New Zealand&#x27;s worst rail accident.

==Bridge collapse==

On 24 December 1953, the 3 p.m. express train from Wellington to Auckland consisted of a KA class steam locomotive hauling eleven carriages: five second-class, four first-class, a guard&#x27;s van and a postal van. With 285 passengers and crew, the train was stated by a witness—the station agent at Tangiwai railway station—to have passed through on time at 10:20 pm at about . The specified maximum track speed between Hīhītahi (to the south of Tangiwai) and Ohakune (to the north) at the time was . There was no evidence presented to the board of inquiry regarding any calculations made or indications of the speed of the locomotive either as it approached the incident site or at the time of the incident.
Approaching the bridge over the Whangaehu River at Tangiwai, in response either to passerby Cyril Ellis standing by the track and waving a torch or upon seeing the condition of the bridge, driver Charles Parker shut off steam and initiated an emergency air brake application, while his fireman, Lance Redman, shut off the oil supply valve for the fire. These actions can be assumed from the state of locomotive cab controls observed following the incident. However, these actions could not stop the train from running onto the bridge, which collapsed, sending the locomotive, its tender and five second-class carriages into the river. The leading first-class carriage teetered on the edge of the bridge before its coupling to the rest of the train snapped and it, too, rolled into the river. The remaining three first-class carriages, the guard&#x27;s van and the postal van remained on the track.

The death toll of 151 consisted of Parker, Redman, 148 second-class passengers and one first-class passenger. Twenty of the bodies were never found and were presumed to have been carried downriver to the sea. Among the dead was Nerissa Love, the fiancée of cricketer Bob Blair, who was playing in a test match in South Africa at the time. On going out to bat after his loss, Blair received a standing ovation.

== Aftermath ==

After the incident, Ellis informed the train&#x27;s guard, William Inglis, of what had happened. The two entered the sixth carriage, then still balanced precariously on the bridge&#x27;s edge, in an attempt to save passengers. While they were in the carriage, it tumbled off the bridge and Ellis and Inglis, with the assistance of passenger John Holman, smashed a window and helped passengers out of the carriage. Of the carriage&#x27;s twenty-four occupants, only one died, a girl who was trapped in her seat and drowned.

Shortly after the accident, rescue teams departed from Waiouru east of Tangiwai. These included soldiers from Waiouru Army Camp, radio operators from Irirangi Naval Communications Station and workmen from the Waiouru Ministry of Works (MOW) camp. By midnight the first survivors had been admitted into the Waiouru Camp Hospital, and by 4 a.m. the following dayChristmas morningthe first bodies had been transported to a makeshift mortuary at the camp.
Prime Minister Sidney Holland arrived at Tangiwai early on Christmas morning after a high-speed drive down from Auckland. He coordinated the rescue work by railway, military, police, MOW, local farmers and undertakers. While the New Zealand Army led efforts near the accident site, local farmers recovered bodies further down the Whangaehu River; at Fields Track, Mount View, Mangamahu, Kauangaroa, Whangaehu village and the river mouth. The bodies were taken by truck to Wanganui and thence by rail to Waiouru, where police and undertakers identified them. Local people recovered sixty bodies from the Mangamāhū section of the river over the following few days, although twenty bodies were never recovered and are thought to have washed out to sea.

For their actions, Ellis and Holman received the George Medal in the 1954 New Zealand bravery awards. Inglis and a passing traveller, Arthur Dewar Bell, both received the British Empire Medal for actions that saved fifteen lives. Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh were visiting New Zealand on their first royal tour when the disaster occurred. The Queen made her Christmas broadcast from Auckland, finishing with a message of sympathy to the people of New Zealand. The Duke of Edinburgh attended a state funeral for many of the victims.

==Public inquiry==
A board of inquiry was appointed to look into the cause of the accident; this sat in public from 26 January until 2 April and reported on 23 April 1954. The bridge had eight piers and seven spans. After the accident, four piers had been damaged and five spans dislodged. The board found that a lahar from Mount Ruapehu had removed the fourth pier a few minutes before the train started to cross the bridge. Their subsequent report stated: 
&quot;The relative positions of the 44 ft. girder (span 3) and the first car (A. 1907) dictate that the girder was removed before the passage of the first car. This girder must therefore have been removed either before the locomotive arrived on the span or during the passage of the locomotive and tender over the span. If this girder was removed during the passage of the locomotive, there is a strong inference that some part of the heavy structure of the locomotive would have hit girder No. 2. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage to girder No. 2, and it may therefore be inferred that girder No. 3 was not removed during the passage of the locomotive across it. Span 3 was therefore carried away before the locomotive entered upon it and there is a strong inference that Pier No. 4 was carried away before the train passed over it. This would also cause span 4 to be carried away. There is also a strong inference that Pier 4 was removed by the lahar and that this caused the accident.&quot; The bridge had been designed for foreseeable flooding and for previous lahars that had different characteristics to the 1953 lahar, the forces of which had been unpredictable.

The official report had this to say about the facts as presented to it: &quot;Much of the evidence submitted relating to the order of events at the crucial time of the destruction of the bridge and of the train and of the conditions about the bridge, including the bed of the river, rests on inferences on which the Board is asked to make findings of fact. It seems unavoidable that the reconstruction of some events and circumstances must rest on such a foundation...&quot; The Board also stated, &quot;...it is appropriate to record that in respect of every member of the train crew of train No. 626 and of every member of the Way and Works and Traffic Branches whose duties can be regarded as being involved in the accident there has been no failure to exercise reasonable care or fulfill any duty or responsibility reasonably to be expected of that member in the circumstances leading to the accident.&quot;

==Legacy==

Following the disaster, the New Zealand Railways Department installed a lahar warning system upstream in the river to alert train control to high river flows. The early warning system installed in 1999 measures the river level using radar and sends the level to the Network Control Centre at Wellington railway station via an RF link to Waiouru and then via the signalling network to Wellington. If the river changes level, an alarm is triggered which alerts staff to the fact. If the level indicates a significant risk, the control centre sets the signals on either side of the Tangiwai bridge to danger and warns trains in the area to stay clear by radio. The system has a failsafe feature which automatically sends a fault signal to the control centre. In such a situation, trains in the area are restricted to and told to take extreme care over the Tangiwai bridge. Since 2002, it has also been backed up by the Eastern Ruapehu Lahar Alarm and Warning System (ERLAWS).

A lahar of similar magnitude to the one from 1953 occurred on 18 March 2007. The early warning systems worked as planned, stopping trains and motorists at Tangiwai before the lahar hit. The newer bridges held up to the lahar, and trains resumed operation after inspection.

In recognition of the disaster itself, and the effect that it had on the concurrent Test match between New Zealand and South Africa, since 2024 the Test cricket teams of New Zealand and South Africa play for the &quot;Tangiwai Shield&quot;.

===Dramatisations===
 In May 1993 the TVNZ Communicado co-produced &quot;Heroes&quot; series had an episode covering the Tangiwai Disaster.
The 2002 documentary &quot;The Truth About Tangiwai&quot;, directed by New Zealand filmmaker David Sims, examines events surrounding the tragedy.

In 2011, a television film about the disaster was made by Lippy Pictures for Television New Zealand. Entitled &quot;Tangiwai: A Love Story&quot;, it follows the disaster and the love story between Blair and Love (portrayed by Ryan O&#x27;Kane and Rose McIver respectively). It premiered on TV One on 14 August 2011. A play written and performed by Auckland actor Jonny Brugh, &quot;The Second Test&quot;, tells the same story from Blair&#x27;s perspective, emphasizing his commitment to continue playing after hearing of the tragedy.

<doc id="308851" wikidata="Q151814" url="?curid=308851" title="Sarah Brightman">
<text>Sarah Brightman (born 14 August 1960) is an English classical crossover soprano singer and actress.

Brightman began her career as a member of the dance troupe Hot Gossip and released several disco singles as a solo performer. In 1981, she made her West End musical theatre debut in &quot;Cats&quot; and met composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, whom she later married. She went on to star in several West End and Broadway musicals, including &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, where she originated the role of Christine Daaé. Her original London cast album of &quot;Phantom&quot; was released in CD format in 1987 and sold 40 million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling cast album ever.

After retiring from stage acting and divorcing Lloyd Webber, Brightman resumed her music career with former Enigma producer Frank Peterson, this time as a classical crossover artist. She has been credited as the creator and remains among the most prominent performers of this genre, with worldwide sales of more than 25 million albums and two million DVDs, establishing herself as the world&#x27;s best-selling soprano.

Brightman&#x27;s 1996 duet with the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;, topped the charts all over Europe and became the highest and fastest-selling single of all time in Germany, where it stayed at the top of the charts for 14 consecutive weeks and sold over three million copies. It subsequently became an international success, selling 12 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all-time. She has collected over 200 gold and platinum record awards in 38 countries. In 2010, she was named by &quot;Billboard&quot; the fifth most influential and best-selling classical artist of the 2000s decade in the US and according to Nielsen SoundScan, she has sold 6.5 million albums in the country.

Brightman is the first artist to have been invited twice to perform the theme song at the Olympic Games, first at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games where she sang &quot;Amigos Para Siempre&quot; with the Spanish tenor José Carreras with an estimated global audience of one billion people, and 16 years later in 2008 in Beijing, this time with Chinese singer Liu Huan, performing the song &quot;You and Me&quot; to an estimated four billion people worldwide.

In 2012, Brightman was appointed as the UNESCO Artist for Peace for the period 2012–2014, for her &quot;commitment to humanitarian and charitable causes, her contribution, throughout her artistic career, to the promotion of cultural dialogue and the exchanges among cultures, and her dedication to the ideals and aims of the Organization&quot;. Since 2010, Brightman has been Panasonic&#x27;s global brand ambassador.

==Family and early life==
Brightman is the eldest of six children of businessman Grenville Brightman (1934–1992) and Paula Brightman, née Hall. She was brought up in Little Gaddesden near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England. At the age of three she began taking dance and piano classes. She
then went on to perform in local festivals and competitions. At age 11, she successfully auditioned for the Tring Park School for the Performing Arts, a school specialising in performing arts.

She received her education at Elmhurst Ballet School, Camberley, the Arts Educational School in Chiswick, West London, and the Royal College of Music.

In 1973, at the age of 13, Brightman made her theatrical debut in the musical &quot;I and Albert&quot; at the Piccadilly Theatre, London, playing one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughters (Victoria).
In 1976 she was recruited into Arlene Phillips&#x27; troupe Hot Gossip in 1977. The group had a disco hit in 1978 with &quot;I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper&quot;, which sold half a million and reached number six on the UK charts. She was also briefly with Pan&#x27;s People after they parted with their host show Top of the Pops in 1976. Brightman, now solo, released more disco singles under her own label, Whisper Records, such as &quot;Not Having That!&quot; and a cover of the song &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot;. In 1979, Brightman appeared on the soundtrack of the film &quot;The World Is Full of Married Men&quot; and sang the song &quot;Madam Hyde&quot;.

==Career==

===1981–1989: Stage career===

In 1981, Brightman auditioned for the new musical &quot;Cats&quot;, by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, and was cast as Jemima. After a year in &quot;Cats&quot;, Brightman took over from Bonnie Langford as Kate in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; at the Drury Lane Theatre, London, and appeared as Tara Treetops in &quot;Masquerade&quot;, a musical based on Kit Williams&#x27;s book of the same title. Beginning on December 18,1982, she left to play the title role in Charles Strouse&#x27;s children&#x27;s opera, &quot;Nightingale&quot;.

Enticed by a rave review, Lloyd Webber went to watch her in the show one evening and was greatly impressed by her performance. Though she had appeared in his musical &quot;Cats&quot;, Lloyd Webber had not previously singled Brightman out as a great talent. The two married in 1984, and Brightman appeared in Lloyd Webber&#x27;s subsequent musicals including &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and &quot;Song and Dance&quot;, as well as the mass Requiem, which was written and composed for Lloyd Webber&#x27;s father.
In 1985, Brightman&#x27;s recording of &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; was a strong commercial success, selling 25,000 copies on the first day of release and peaking at number 3, despite the lyrics being in Latin. With classical music permeating the Lloyd Webber household (Brightman was in heavy operatic training at the time), Lloyd Webber was moved to write the Requiem Mass as a tribute to his father. Its Manhattan premiere, starring Plácido Domingo and Brightman, was filmed by the BBC and PBS for later broadcast. The LP eventually became UK&#x27;s top selling classical album of the year and earned Brightman a Grammy nomination as Best New Classical Artist.

Brightman starred as Christine Daaé in Lloyd Webber&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. The role of Christine was written specifically for her. Lloyd Webber refused to open &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; on Broadway unless Brightman played Christine. Initially, the American Actors&#x27; Equity Association balked, because of their policy that any non-American performer must be an international star. Lloyd Webber had to cast an American in a leading role in his next West End musical before Equity would allow Brightman to appear (a promise he kept in casting &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;). In the end, it was a compromise that was successful. &quot;Phantom&quot; received $17 million in advance sales prior to opening night on 26 January 1988. The original cast album was the first in British musical history to enter the music charts at number one. Album sales now exceed forty million worldwide—the biggest selling cast album of all time—and has gone six times platinum in the United States, twice platinum in the UK, nine times platinum in Germany, four times platinum in the Netherlands, 11 times platinum in Korea and 31 times platinum in Taiwan. Despite the success both in London and on Broadway, Brightman received mostly negative reception from critics for her performance and was not nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Musical at the Tony Awards. While some reviewers praised Brightman for her singing, her acting was widely criticized.

After leaving &quot;Phantom,&quot; she performed in a tour of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s music throughout England, Canada and the United States, and performed Requiem in the Soviet Union. Studio recordings from this time include the single &quot;Anything But Lonely&quot; from &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; and two solo albums: the 1988 album &quot;The Trees They Grow So High,&quot; a collection of folk songs accompanied by piano, and the 1989 album &quot;The Songs That Got Away,&quot; a compilation of obscure musical theatre songs from shows by such composers as Irving Berlin and Stephen Sondheim. Brightman also sang the song &quot;Make Believe&quot; during the credits of the children&#x27;s film &quot;Granpa&quot;; Howard Blake composed the music and wrote the lyrics.

She was a subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1989 when she was surprised by Michael Aspel at RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire.

By 1990, Brightman and Lloyd Webber had separated. After their highly publicized divorce, Brightman played the lead in Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Aspects&quot; in London opposite Michael Praed, before transferring to Broadway. Her subsequent solo album, &quot;As I Came of Age,&quot; was an eclectic collection of folk-rock and musical theatre songs that Brightman herself chose.

===1990s: Solo career===

In 1992, Brightman performed with José Carreras at the Barcelona Olympic Games singing the theme song &quot;Amigos Para Siempre&quot; (&quot;Friends Forever&quot;). Following the appearance, Brightman pursued solo recording, and inspired by the German band Enigma, she requested to work with one of its members, Frank Peterson. Their first release together was &quot;Dive&quot; (1993), a water-themed pop album that featured &quot;Captain Nemo&quot;, a cover of a song by the Swedish electronica band Dive. The album received her first Gold award in Canada.

Brightman and Peterson&#x27;s second collaboration yielded the pop rock album, &quot;Fly&quot; (1995) with the single &quot;A Question of Honor&quot;—a mélange of electronic, rock, classical strings and excerpts from the Alfredo Catalani opera &quot;La Wally&quot;. The song and the video were introduced at the World Boxing Championship match between Germany&#x27;s Henry Maske and Graciano Rocchigiani.

In 1997, Brightman released the album &quot;Timeless/Time to Say Goodbye&quot;. It remains as Brightman&#x27;s biggest-selling album. It went gold, platinum and/or multi-platinum in 21 countries, selling over 1.4 million copies in the US, and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Classical Crossover Albums chart in the US for 35 weeks. The lead single from the album, &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;, was the second song that Brightman debuted at the World Boxing Championship in Germany. This duet with tenor Andrea Bocelli became an international hit and sold more than 3 million copies in Germany. The album eventually sold over 12 million copies worldwide.

In March 1998, Brightman produced her first own PBS special, Sarah Brightman: In Concert at the Royal Albert Hall. The same year, Brightman starred in &quot;A Gala Christmas in Vienna&quot; alongside Plácido Domingo, Helmut Lotti and Riccardo Cocciante singing traditional Christmas carols. On 7 April 1998 she was one of the guest stars in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 50th birthday celebration singing &quot;Hosanna&quot; with Dennis O&#x27;Neill, the title song of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; with Antonio Banderas, &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; with Michael Ball and &quot;Music of the Night&quot;, both also from &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

With the success of &quot;Timeless&quot;, Brightman released her next album, &quot;Eden&quot; in 1998. She personally selected each song and convinced the Italian composer Ennio Morricone to let her set lyrics to one of his film compositions, &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Oboe&quot; from the film &quot;The Mission&quot; resulting in &quot;Nella Fantasia&quot;. The album, unlike &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;, incorporated more pop music elements. Reviews were mixed – LAUNCHcast deemed &quot;Eden&quot; &quot;deliriously sappy&quot;, while AllMusic called &quot;Eden&quot; &quot;a winning combination&quot;. &quot;Eden&quot; reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Classical Crossover Albums chart and No. 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified Gold in the United States.

===2000–2004: Further international success===

In 2000, &quot;La Luna&quot; was released. For this album, Brightman chose songs drawing on pop, vintage jazz, and high opera, in homages to Dvořák, Beethoven and Billie Holiday. &quot;La Luna&quot; reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Internet Albums and peaked at No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, becoming Brightman&#x27;s second highest-selling album in the United States with sales of 900,000 and reaching Gold certification. It became her biggest-selling album in Asia, with a quintuple platinum certification in Taiwan.

At her 2000 PBS La Luna concert, Brightman sang &quot;There for Me&quot; in a duet with an up-and-coming star, Josh Groban. At the end of 2001, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine noted Brightman as the most important classical crossover artist from the United Kingdom.

In 2001, Brightman released &quot;Classics&quot;, an anthology including highlights from three of Brightman&#x27;s chart-topping releases along with seven new tracks; this was released worldwide except Europe. In the US the album peaked at No. 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and went Gold. In Canada it peaked at No. 9 and was certified Platinum; and in Japan, &quot;Classics&quot; became Brightman&#x27;s most successful release at the time with 300,000 units sold and reaching Platinum status.

Her 2003 album &quot;Harem&quot; represented another departure: a Middle Eastern-themed album influenced by dance music. On &quot;Harem&quot;, Brightman collaborated with artists such as Ofra Haza and Iraqi singer Kazem al-Saher. Nigel Kennedy contributed violin tracks to the songs &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;The War is Over&quot; and Jaz Coleman contributed arrangements.

The album peaked at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Classical Crossover Albums chart, No. 1 on the Swedish Album Chart, and yielded a No. 1 dance/club single with the remix of the title track. Some time later, another single from the album (the ballad &quot;Free&quot;, cowritten with Sophie B. Hawkins) became a second Top-10 hit on this chart.

The albums &quot;Eden&quot;, &quot;La Luna&quot; and &quot;Harem&quot; were accompanied by live world tours which incorporated the theatricality of her stage origins. Brightman acknowledged this in an interview, saying, &quot;They&#x27;re incredibly complicated...[but also] natural. I know what works, what doesn&#x27;t work, all the old tricks&quot;. In both 2000 and 2001, Brightman was among the top 10 most popular British performers in the US, with concert sales grossing $7.2 million from 34 shows in 2000 and over $5 million from 21 shows in 2001.

In 2004, the Harem World Tour grossed $60 million and sold 700,000 tickets, $15 million and 225,000 sales of which came from the North American leg, although with ticket prices raised 30% from previous tours, average sales per venue were up 65%. In North America, Harem tour promoters Clear Channel Entertainment (now Live Nation) took the unusual step of advertising to theatre subscribers, in an effort to reach fans of Brightman&#x27;s Broadway performances, and also sold VIP tickets, at $750 each, which included on-stage seating during the concert and a backstage pass. Tour reviews were mixed: one critic from the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the La Luna tour &quot;not so much divine but post-human&quot; and &quot;unintentionally disturbing: a beautiful argument of emptiness.&quot;

Television specials on PBS were produced for nearly every Brightman album in the US; a director of marketing has credited these as her number-one source of exposure in the country. Her concert for &quot;Eden&quot; was among PBS&#x27;s highest-grossing pledge events.

===2006–2008: &quot;Diva&quot;, &quot;Symphony&quot; and Beijing Olympics appearance===

Brightman released a DVD collection of her music videos on 3 October 2006 under the title of &quot;&quot;. &quot;&quot; is the accompanying CD, released on the same date. The album marked the first time Brightman released a greatest hits album in the United States; it reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Classical Crossover Albums chart. In Japan, the album debuted and peaked at No. 2 with 77,000 copies sold on its first week of release, and became Japan&#x27;s biggest-selling classical album of 2007. Subsequently, it was Japan&#x27;s fifteenth best-selling international album of the 2000s decade. By 2008, the album achieved a Double-Platinum certification. With &quot;Diva&quot;, Brightman was also South Korea&#x27;s best-selling international artist of 2010 as the album topped the international charts all throughout the year. &quot;Diva&quot; was certified Quintuple Platinum and its digital single, &quot;Nella Fantasia&quot; sold over 2 million units. Other releases in Europe were &quot;The Very Best of 1990–2000&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
On 1 July 2007, Brightman appeared at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event organised to celebrate the life of Princess Diana of Wales, where she sang &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; with Josh Groban. Around 15 million people across the UK watched &quot;Concert for Diana&quot; at home, and it was broadcast to over 500 million homes in 140 countries. On 7 July 2007 Brightman performed four songs (&quot;Nessun dorma&quot;, &quot;La Luna&quot;, &quot;Nella Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;) at the Live Earth Concert Series, and debuted her single &quot;Running&quot; at the 2007 IAAF Championships in Osaka, Japan. In this period Brightman also recorded a duet with Anne Murray singing &quot;Snowbird&quot;, which was included on Murray&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Anne Murray Duets: Friends and Legends&quot;.

On 29 January 2008, Brightman released her first album in five years: &quot;Symphony&quot;, influenced by gothic music. In the United States, it became Brightman&#x27;s most successful chart entry and also her highest ranked album on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 200 Albums&quot;. It was also a No. 1 album on two other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts: &quot;Top Internet Albums&quot; and &quot;Top Classical Crossover Albums&quot;. The album moved there 32,033 copies in first week, according to Nielsen Soundscan. The album was a top 5 release in China, Taiwan, Canada, Mexico and Japan and a top 20 across Europe.

Featured on the album were artists Andrea Bocelli, Fernando Lima, and KISS vocalist Paul Stanley, who sang duets with Brightman on &quot;I Will Be with You&quot;, the album version of the theme song to the tenth Pokémon motion picture, &quot;Dialga VS Palkia VS Darkrai&quot; (&quot;Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai&quot;). On 16 January 2008, she also appeared in concert at Vienna&#x27;s Stephansdom Cathedral, performing songs from her new album. Special guests who sang duets with Brightman include Italian tenor Alessandro Safina, Argentinean countertenor Fernando Lima, and British singer Chris Thompson.
Brightman performed &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; and &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot; at the United States Memorial Day concert on 25 May 2008 held on the west lawn of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The show was broadcast live on PBS before a concert audience of 300,000, as well as to American troops serving around the world on the American Forces Radio and Television Network. Brightman made her feature film debut as Blind Mag in the rock musical film &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot; which was released on 7 November 2008. Brightman was cast in the film at the last minute after the original actress who was cast for the role was dropped.

On 8 August 2008, Brightman sang the Olympic theme song, &quot;You and Me&quot;, with Chinese star Liu Huan in both Mandarin and English at the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony. The performance was broadcast to over five billion viewers. In the 26 hours after the performance, &quot;You and Me&quot; was downloaded 5.7 million times.

Brightman released her first holiday album, entitled &quot;A Winter Symphony&quot; on 4 November 2008. The album debuted at number No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and scored a number six in the Top Holiday Albums. The album was composed of an array of Christmas favourites including &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;. Also featured are a duet in &quot;Ave Maria&quot; with Mexican Tenor Fernando Lima, covers of pop tracks including ABBA&#x27;s instrumental song &quot;Arrival&quot; plus a rendition of Neil Diamond&#x27;s, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been this Way Before&quot;.

To accompany &quot;Symphony&quot; and &quot;A Winter Symphony&quot;, Brightman embarked on a tour in Autumn 2008; &quot;The Symphony World Tour&quot;, that included virtual and holographic stage sets.

===2009–2010: &quot;Symphony: Live in Vienna&quot; and UNESCO World Heritage Sites concerts===

In response to persistent calls for a global release of the concert, EMI Music launched worldwide the PBS special which featured Brightman&#x27;s performance at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna, on 16 January 2008, in both audio and visual formats. The Symphony—Live in Vienna television special debuted on PBS in March 2008 during the network&#x27;s spring pledge drive and aired throughout the month. &quot;Symphony: Live in Vienna&quot; was listed as the thirteenth best-selling album of the year in Mexico.

The music of Brightman was featured in the film &quot;Amarufi: Megami no hôshû&quot; (international title: &quot;&quot;), which was a special production to mark Fuji Television&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the first Japanese film to be shot entirely on location in Italy. In conjunction with the release of the film &quot;Amalfi&quot;, Brightman released only in Japan an album titled &quot;Amalfi – Sarah Brightman Love Songs&quot; which reached Gold status and was Japan&#x27;s best-selling classical album of 2009. At the end of the year, Brightman was the seventh best selling international artist in Japan.
Brightman performed &quot;The Concert of the Pyramid&quot; at the archaeological site of Chichen Itza, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. One year later, in 2010, Brightman continued touring Asia with five performances in Tokyo alone, followed by presentations in Kanazawa, Nagoya, Osaka in Japan, Macau in China and Seoul in South Korea.

On 3 November 2010, Brightman was invited to sing at the Tōdai-ji Buddhist temple complex located in the city of Nara, Japan. The temple is a listed UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara&quot;. The concert was recorded and later broadcast nationwide by TBS network.

===2011–2015: UNESCO, &quot;Dreamchaser&quot; and space tourism===

In early 2012, Brightman received the UNESCO Artist for Peace Award for her &quot;commitment to humanitarian and charitable causes, her contribution, throughout her artistic career, to the promotion of cultural dialogue and the exchanges among cultures, and her dedication to the ideals and aims of the Organization&quot;. She was also appointed as Panasonic&#x27;s global brand ambassador, and is the face of Panasonic&#x27;s strategic partnership agreement with the UNESCO World Heritage Centre as she starred in their joint campaign, &quot;The World Heritage Special,&quot; that was aired on the National Geographic Channel worldwide.

This album was Brightman&#x27;s first collaboration with producer Mike Hedges and Sally Herbert. It received acclaim from critics, many considering it Brightman&#x27;s strongest work to date, and many pointed out the coherence of the song choices and the quality of Brightman&#x27;s vocals. &quot;Dreamchaser&quot; was Brightman&#x27;s first album to enter on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums chart, became her seventh No. 1 album in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Classical Albums chart and made a strong debut in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 17 moving 20,358 copies on its first week of release.

On 6 June, Brightman filmed a new PBS TV special entitled &quot;Sarah Brightman: Dreamchaser in Concert&quot; at Elstree Studios where she set up a competition so fans could have the chance of winning tickets to attend the exclusive filming. &quot;Dreamchaser in Concert&quot; aired on PBS on 3 August, with a setlist of twelve songs (plus two bonus songs) featuring both new songs and well-known favorites.

During the ceremony, Genuardi expressed, the motivation of Brightman&#x27;s distinction: &quot;Ms. Sarah Brightman who with her extraordinary voice and with her excellent music has contributed in an excellent way in spreading the Italian language and culture at a high level worldwide&quot;. The private ceremony was held on the occasion of the Festa della Repubblica Italiana (The Italian National Day) at the Consulate General of Italy in New York City.

On 6 July 2016, Brightman released her eighth compilation album: &quot;Gala – The Collection&quot;. This album was released exclusively on Japan in commemoration of the tour, . The concert tour would later add more destinations, presenting shows in other Asian countries, such as South Korea, China and Taiwan.

In addition to the new album, Brightman announced a world tour, which began in South America in November 2018 and included 125 shows across five continents throughout 2019, concluding with her return to London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall for the first time over 20 years, with guest performers from the &quot;Hymn&quot; album Narcis, Vincent Niclo, and Yoshiki.

In 2022, Brightman became a judge of the talent competition show &quot;Yoshiki Superstar Project X&quot;, airing on Hulu Japan and produced by Yoshiki. In September 2023, Brightman was featured in the music documentary film &quot;&quot;.

On October 10, 2023, it was announced that Brightman would take the lead role of Norma Desmond in the 2024 Australian season of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in Melbourne from May 2024 before moving to the Sydney Opera House for residence from August 2024.

==Music and voice==

Brightman underwent vocal training first with Elizabeth Hawes, head of the Trinity Music College in London, and later with Ellen Faull of Juilliard. She also studied with voice teacher David Romano. According to Brightman, her voice can reach an F6.

David Caddick, a conductor of &quot;Phantom&quot;, has stated:
What is amazing about Sarah is that she has two voices, really. She can produce a pop, contemporary sound, but she can also blossom out into a light lyric soprano. The soprano part of her voice can go up to a F6 above her known E6. She doesn&#x27;t sing it full out, but it is there. Of course, she has to dance while she is singing some of the time, so it&#x27;s all the more extraordinary.

She sometimes uses her pop and classical voices in the same song. One example is &quot;Anytime, Anywhere&quot; from &quot;Eden&quot;, a song based on Albinoni&#x27;s Adagio in G minor. In the song, she starts out in classical voice, switches to pop voice temporarily, and finishes with her classical voice. Another example is heard in the Lions Gate film &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot;, during the songs &quot;Chase The Morning&quot; and &quot;Chromaggia&quot; by her character, Blind Mag.

Brightman&#x27;s music is generally classified as classical crossover. According to Manhattan Records GM Ian Ralfini, she is largely responsible for the popularity of the genre. In a 2000 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Brightman dismissed the classical crossover label as &quot;horrible&quot; but stated she understood people&#x27;s need to categorise music. Her personal influences include 1960s and 1970s musicians and artists such as David Bowie and Pink Floyd, and she incorporates aspects of genres from pop/rock to classical. Her work has also been compared to that of Madonna, Cher and Celine Dion. The material on her albums ranges from versions of opera arias from composers such as Puccini (on &quot;Harem&quot;, &quot;Eden&quot;, and &quot;Timeless&quot;), to pop songs by artists such as Kansas (&quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; on &quot;Eden&quot;), Dido (&quot;Here with Me&quot; on &quot;La Luna&quot;), and Procol Harum (&quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; on &quot;La Luna&quot;). She sings in many languages, including English, Spanish, French, Latin, Italian and Japanese.

==Personal life==
At age 18, in 1979, Brightman married Andrew Graham-Stewart, who at that time managed the German band Tangerine Dream. She later met Andrew Lloyd Webber when she performed in &quot;Cats&quot;. In 1983, Brightman divorced Graham-Stewart and later that same year, Lloyd Webber divorced his first wife, Sarah Hugill, with whom he had two children. Lloyd Webber and Brightman married on 22 March 1984 and their relationship quickly became the subject of intense media and tabloid scrutiny until their divorce in 1990. They are on friendly terms; in 2006, at the 20th London anniversary of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, Lloyd Webber called Brightman a &quot;wonderful woman&quot; and &quot;absolutely beloved mentor&quot;, and she performed at the 25th anniversary of the musical in 2011. He appeared as a special guest in her 1997 concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

Brightman had a 10-year relationship with Frank Peterson, during which they tried and were unsuccessful in having children. In a 2006 interview with British magazine &quot;Hello!&quot;, she said motherhood would have been &quot;lovely&quot; but accepted that she would never have a child.

==Charity work==
On 8 February 2012, Brightman accepted the UNESCO nomination to be an &quot;Artist for Peace&quot; Ambassador. Additionally, she is actively engaged in Panasonic&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Centre endeavours, and stars in their &quot;The World Heritage Special&quot; campaign.

In 2012, in conjunction with Virgin Galactic, the Brightman STEM Scholarship program (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) was launched. It will help young women in the US pursue STEM education across their four-year college careers.

On 27 June 2013, the Reignwood Group announced at the Beijing Theatre that Brightman would be a promotional ambassador for its 10 Trinity Square, a landmark in the Reignwood Group&#x27;s global expansion, in London for the next four years. This is the second time for the group to cooperate with an influential artist, the first being with tenor Plácido Domingo, in 2008.

In November 2013, Brightman donated US$533,000 to those affected by Hurricane Ingrid in the Mexican state of Guerrero—the entire profit from her sold-out show in Mexico City on 13 November 2013.

On 30 October 2013, Brightman announced through the media that she was honoured to be part of the Advisory Council for the Challenger Center, the non-profit science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education organisation, stating &quot;[t]hrough my partnership with the Challenger Center, I hope to inspire in children the same wonder and excitement for space exploration that I feel myself.&quot; Challenger Center and its network of more than 40 Challenger Learning Centers engage students in hands-on experiences that strengthen knowledge in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) and inspire students to pursue careers in these important fields.

In April 2014, Brightman participated as an orchestra director in Parkinson&#x27;s UK &quot;Symfunny&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall 4 June, with the aim of funding research to find a cure for the disease.

In July 2015, the inaugural Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation Sarah Brightman Music Scholarships were also awarded to their first recipients. The scholarships will support students in their postgraduate studies at the Royal Northern College of Music on the two-year Master of Music Programme.

==Awards==
Brightman has received over 180 Gold and Platinum sales awards in over 40 countries.

Brightman was awarded the decoration &#x27;Cavaliere&#x27; in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic on 2 June 2016.

<text>Shepparton () (Yortayorta: &quot;Kanny-goopna&quot;) is a city located on the floodplain of the Goulburn River in northern Victoria, Australia, approximately north-northeast of Melbourne. As of the 2021 census, the estimated population of Shepparton, including the adjacent town of Mooroopna, was 53,841.

It began as a sheep station and river crossing in the mid-19th century, before undergoing a major transformation as a railway town. Today it is an agricultural and manufacturing centre, and the centre of the Goulburn Valley irrigation system, one of the largest centres of irrigation in Australia. It is also a major regional service city and the seat of local government and civic administration for the City of Greater Shepparton, which includes the surrounding towns of Tatura, Merrigum, Mooroopna, Murchison, Dookie, Toolamba and Grahamvale.

== Toponymy ==
The name of Shepparton is derived from the surname of one of the area&#x27;s first European settlers, Sherbourne Sheppard, and not, as is sometimes imagined, from Shepperton, England.

The Yorta Yorta name for the area is &#x27;Kanny-goopna&#x27; with &#x27;goopna&#x27; meaning &#x27;deep waterholes by which people camped&#x27;. Conversely, the name for the big waterhole at the Broken River at Benalla is &#x27;Marangan&#x27;, meaning deep pond or lagoon in Taungurung Eastern Kulin language.

Colloquially (and not inconsistent with the Australian propensity for name-shortening or diminutives), the city is also known as &quot;Shepp&quot; (), as adopted by community entities that incorporate the abbreviated form into their name. eg. The Shepparton Agricultural Society &quot;Sheppshow&quot;.

For example:

&quot;Are you going to Shepp for the holidays?&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m off to Shepp for work.&quot;

&quot;My family comes from Shepp.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m a Shepp town boy&quot; Hip Hop group Shepp Town Boy — Young Ugess

== History ==
Prior to the European settlement of Australia, the area was inhabited by the Yorta Yorta, the indigenous Australian people whose country covers the junction of the Goulburn and Murray Rivers in present-day northern Victoria and southern New South Wales. The town of Shepparton and surrounds are on the country of the Kailtheban clan of the Yorta Yorta nation.

Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell was the first European to be recorded traveling through the area, crossing the Goulburn River in 1836 on his return to Sydney from an expedition to survey the Darling River and its tributaries. On Mitchell&#x27;s recommendation, Joseph Hawdon and Charles Bonney would follow two years later, camping on the town site by the Goulburn River in 1838 while droving cattle from Albury to Adelaide.

The first permanent settlement in the area was the &quot;Tallygaroopna&quot; sheep station, established in the early 1840s. By 1843 the station was being run by a man named Sherbourne Sheppard, the town&#x27;s eventual namesake. With the advent of the Victorian gold rush in the 1850s, the area became a popular river crossing point for miners travelling east from the Bendigo and Ballarat goldfields. As there was no bridge across the Goulburn River, Irish entrepreneur Patrick Macguire set up a punt service to ferry travellers across the river, erecting the town&#x27;s first building in the process, the punt house. Macguire sold the building to John Hill in 1853, who converted it into a hotel, the Emu Bush Inn. This settlement soon became known as Macguire&#x27;s Punt, a name it would keep into the 1870s. A post office opened in February 1854, but closed in July that same year.

The settlement was first surveyed in 1855 by Assistant Surveyor J.G.W. Wilmot. By this time, in addition to Macguire&#x27;s Punt, it had also become known as Sheppard town, Sheppardton, and Shepparton. The post office reopened in May 1858, and two years later the Governor of Victoria officially declared Shepparton a township on 24 September 1860. It remained a small settlement of a half-dozen buildings into the 1870s despite adding a police station, a general store, a blacksmith, a foundry, and a public hall which remains the city&#x27;s oldest building. Shepparton&#x27;s first bridge over the Goulburn River was completed in 1878 and named Dainton&#x27;s Bridge after James Henry Dainton, the bridge&#x27;s chief engineer. The first church, St. Patrick&#x27;s, opened in 1879.

The railway from Seymour reached the town in 1880. A mechanics institute opened between 1880 and 1888 as Shepparton rapidly developed into a major manufacturing and service centre.

During the Victorian railway boom the railways expanded, and by the turn of the century Shepparton was central to a large network of regional branch lines on the Toolamba–Echuca railway line — lines leading to Cobram, Nathalia, Dookie, Picola and Katamatite. Rail-served industries helped Shepparton grow into a city. While these lines experienced a brief boom, almost all of them would later close. The Goulburn River also developed as a secondary transport hub, with paddle steamers and ferries operating at The Barges.

In the post-war era the city&#x27;s population virtually tripled, with immigration to the city becoming a major factor, particularly of Mediterranean origin including new residents from Italy, Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia and Macedonia. Post war the city&#x27;s built environment also went through rapid change, with many of the old buildings being replaced with modern ones. One of the last significant pre-war buildings, the post office was modernised during this period before being demolished for the construction of a concrete building in 1973. Prior to its demolition the much loved landmark was originally planned to be rebuilt in another location as part of the development of an International Village however the proposal fell through. Since the 2000s there was renewed interest in rebuilding the lost landmark as a Local Heritage Museum.

<text>The Phantom of the Opera is a 2004 musical romantic drama film based on Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical of the same name, which in turn is based on Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel, &quot;Le Fantôme de l&#x27;Opéra&quot;. Produced and co-written by Lloyd Webber and directed by Joel Schumacher, it stars Gerard Butler as the titular character, with Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson, Minnie Driver, Simon Callow, Ciarán Hinds, Victor McGuire and Jennifer Ellison in supporting roles.

The film was announced in 1989, although production did not start until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber&#x27;s divorce and Schumacher&#x27;s busy career. It was shot entirely at Pinewood Studios, with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and was provided with music lessons prior to filming. &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; grossed $154.6 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the visuals and acting, particularly the performances of the lead actors, but criticism towards the writing, direction and unnecessary deviations from the source material. Despite this reception, the film received several awards and nominations (including three Oscars), as well as a positive reception from the audience.

==Plot== 

In 1870, a Parisian opera house prepares for the performance of the opera &quot;Hannibal&quot;, headed by soprano Carlotta Giudicelli. Theatre manager Monsieur Lefèvre plans to retire, leaving the opera house under the ownership of scrappers Richard Firmin and Gilles André, who introduce their patron, Viscount Raoul de Chagny. Carlotta refuses to perform after being constantly tormented by the theatre&#x27;s resident &quot;Opera Ghost&quot;, who is said to live in the catacombs below. Facing the performance&#x27;s cancellation, ballet mistress Madame Giry suggests that dancer Christine Daaé, Raoul&#x27;s childhood sweetheart, to stand in for Carlotta; she displays her singing talents and is a success on opening night.

Christine tells her best friend Meg, Giry&#x27;s daughter, that she is being coached by a tutor she calls the &quot;Angel of Music&quot;, which had been sent by her late father following his passing. Christine reunites with Raoul and confides that she has been visited by the Angel, but he dismisses her story. That night, the masked Opera Ghost, better known as the &quot;Phantom&quot;, appears before Christine from the dressing room&#x27;s mirror, leading her away to his underground lair. After the Phantom reveals a mannequin of Christine dressed in a wedding dress he made for her, Christine faints and sleeps in the lair.

Once Christine awakes and sees the Phantom, she removes his mask. The Phantom reacts violently and covers his face with his hand. Christine returns the mask to the Phantom, who then returns her to the theatre unharmed but orders the managers to make her the lead in &quot;Il Muto&quot;, only for them to choose Carlotta instead. During the performance, the Phantom switches Carlotta&#x27;s throat spray, causing her to sing out of tune, and Christine replaces her. The Phantom encounters a stagehand and hangs him above the stage. Christine and Raoul flee to the roof, declaring their love for each other. The Phantom, now heartbroken after witnessing the scene, vows revenge.

Three months later, Christine and Raoul announce their engagement at a New Year masquerade ball. The Phantom crashes the ball and orders his opera, &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot;, to be performed. Upon seeing Christine&#x27;s engagement ring, the Phantom steals it and flees, pursued by Raoul, but Giry thwarts him. When Giry was younger, she met the Phantom, a deformed young boy, billed in a freak show and abused by the owner. When the Phantom rebelled and strangled the owner to death, Giry helped him evade the alerted authorities and kept him hidden within the theater. The next day, Christine visits her father&#x27;s tomb with the Phantom posing as his spirit to win her back, but Raoul intervenes.

Raoul and the managers plan to capture the Phantom during his opera, but he usurps the lead tenor to get to Christine, who soon unmasks him during a duet and exposes his deformed face to the horrified audience. The Phantom then abducts Christine and retreats as he causes the auditorium&#x27;s chandelier to crash, sparking a building-wide inferno to cover his tracks. However, a mob aided by the gathered authorities forms to hunt him down. Giry leads Raoul to the Phantom&#x27;s lair to rescue Christine, while Meg also leads the mob.

The Phantom has Christine wear the wedding dress and proposes marriage. Christine tries reasoning with him by admitting that she only fears his malicious acts, not his appearance. When Raoul arrives, the Phantom threatens his life unless Christine weds him, to which she kisses him out of pity. Moved by her compassion, the Phantom allows the couple to leave. Comforted by a music box, the Phantom is allowed to keep Christine&#x27;s ring. He then escapes before the mob arrives, with Meg finding only his discarded mask.

Later, in 1919, at a public auction held to clear out the now-condemned opera house&#x27;s vaults, an elderly Raoul bids against the now-retired Giry for the Phantom&#x27;s music box. He later visits the recently deceased Christine&#x27;s grave and places the instrument before it. Before leaving, he notices a freshly laid rose with Christine&#x27;s ring around its stem, implying that the Phantom is still alive and will always love her.

==Production==

===Development===
Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in early 1989, granting Andrew Lloyd Webber total artistic control. Despite interest from A-list directors, Lloyd Webber and Warner Bros. instantly hired Joel Schumacher to direct; Lloyd Webber had been impressed with Schumacher&#x27;s use of music in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. The duo wrote the screenplay that same year, while Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were cast to reprise their roles from the original stage production. Filming was set to begin at Pinewood Studios in England in July 1990, under a $25 million budget.

However, the start date was pushed to November 1990 at both Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam, Germany and Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic. Production for &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was stalled with Lloyd Webber and Brightman&#x27;s divorce. &quot;Everything got tied up in settlements&quot;, Schumacher reflected. &quot;Then my career took off and I was really busy.&quot; As a result, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; languished in development limbo for Warner Bros. throughout the 1990s. In February 1997, Schumacher considered returning, but eventually dropped out in favour of &quot;Batman Unchained&quot;, &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; and &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;. The studio was keen to cast John Travolta for the lead role, but also held discussions with Antonio Banderas, who undertook vocal preparation and sang the role of the Phantom in the TV special &quot;Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Royal Albert Hall Celebration&quot;.

Schumacher and Lloyd Webber restarted development for &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in December 2002. It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. in an attempt to produce &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; independently. As a result, Lloyd Webber invested $6 million of his own money. &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was produced on an $80 million budget. Warner Bros. was given a first-look deal for distribution; when the principal cast was chosen in June 2003, Warner Bros. paid under $8 million to acquire the North American distribution rights.

===Casting===
Hugh Jackman was among those considered for the role of Phantom, but he faced scheduling conflicts with &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. &quot;They rang to ask about my availability&quot;, Jackman explained in an April 2003 interview, &quot;probably about 20 other actors as well. I wasn&#x27;t available, unfortunately. So, that was a bummer.&quot; &quot;We needed somebody who has a bit of rock and roll sensibility in him&quot;, Andrew Lloyd Webber explained. &quot;He&#x27;s got to be a bit rough, a bit dangerous; not a conventional singer. Christine is attracted to the Phantom because he&#x27;s the right side of danger.&quot; Director Joel Schumacher had been impressed with Gerard Butler&#x27;s performance in &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;. Prior to his audition, Butler had no professional singing experience and had only taken four voice lessons before singing &quot;The Music of the Night&quot; for Lloyd Webber.

Katie Holmes, who began working with a vocal coach, was the front-runner for Christine Daaé in March 2003. She was later replaced by Anne Hathaway, a classically trained soprano, in 2004. However, Hathaway dropped out of the role because the production schedule of the film overlapped with &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;, which she was contractually obligated to make. Hathaway was then replaced with Emmy Rossum. The actress modeled the relationship between the Phantom and Christine after Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine. Patrick Wilson was cast as Raoul based on his previous Broadway theatre career. For the role of Carlotta, Minnie Driver devised an over-the-top and campy performance as the egotistical prima donna. Despite also lacking singing experience, Ciarán Hinds was cast by Schumacher as Richard Firmin; the two had previously worked together on &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot;. Ramin Karimloo, who later played the Phantom as well as Raoul on London&#x27;s West End, briefly appears as the portrait of Gustave Daaé, Christine&#x27;s father.

===Filming===
Principal photography lasted from 15 September 2003 to 15 January 2004. The film was shot entirely using eight sound stages at Pinewood Studios, where, on the Pinewood backlot, the bottom half exterior of the opera house was constructed. The top half was implemented using a combination of computer-generated imagery and a scale model created by Cinesite. The surrounding skyline seen during the &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; sequence was entirely composed of matte paintings. Cinesite additionally created a miniature version of the auditorium&#x27;s chandelier used for its fall, since a life-size model was too big for the actual set.

Production designer Anthony D. G. Pratt was influenced by French architect Charles Garnier, designer of the original Paris opera house, as well as Edgar Degas, John Singer Sargent, Gustave Caillebotte, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1946) and featured a hallway lined with candelabra-holding arms. The cemetery was based on the Père Lachaise and Montparnasse. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilized a limited black, white, gold and silver color palette for the &quot;Masquerade&quot; sequence in spite of the lyrics indicating that it is a multicolored affair in which mauve, puce, green and yellow are some of the colors worn by attendees.

==Reception==

===Release===
&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2004 and the United States on 22 December 2004. With a limited release of 622 theaters, it opened at tenth place at the weekend box office, grossing $6.3 million across five days. After expanding to 907 screens on 14 January 2005 the film obtained the 9th spot at the box office, which it retained during its 1,511 screens wide release on 21 January 2005. The total domestic gross was $51.2 million. With a further $107 million earned internationally, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; reached a worldwide total of $154.6 million. A few foreign markets were particularly successful, such as Japan, where the film&#x27;s ¥4.20 billion ($35 million) gross stood as the 6th most successful foreign film and 9th overall of the year. The United Kingdom and South Korea both had over $10 million in receipts, with $17.5 million and $11.9 million, respectively.

=== Accolades ===
Anthony Pratt and Celia Bobak were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as was John Mathieson for Best Cinematography. However, both categories were awarded to &quot;The Aviator&quot;. Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song (&quot;Learn to Be Lonely&quot;) but lost to &quot;Al otro lado del río&quot; from &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;. The song was also nominated for the Golden Globe but it lost to &quot;Alfie&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Old Habits Die Hard&quot;. In the same ceremony, Emmy Rossum was nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, losing to Annette Bening in &quot;Being Julia&quot;. At the Saturn Awards, Rossum won for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, while &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was nominated for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film and Alexandra Byrne was nominated for Costume Design.

===Critical reception===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 33%, based on reviews from 171 critics, with an average score of 5.01/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;The music of the night has hit something of a sour note: critics are calling the screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s popular musical histrionic, boring and lacking in both romance and danger. Still, some have praised the film for its sheer spectacle.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on 39 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Despite having been impressed with the cast, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote that &quot;Teen romance and operetta-style singing replace the horror elements familiar to film-goers, and director Joel Schumacher obscures any remnants of classy stage spectacle with the same disco overkill he brought to &quot;Batman Forever&quot;.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon.com&quot; believed that &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; &quot;takes everything that&#x27;s wrong with Broadway and puts it on the big screen in a gaudy splat.&quot;

In a mixed review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen praised Rossum&#x27;s performance, but criticized the filmmakers for their focus on visual design rather than presenting a cohesive storyline. &quot;Its kitschy romanticism bored me on Broadway and it bores me here—I may not be the most reliable witness. Still, I can easily imagine a more dashing, charismatic Phantom than Butler&#x27;s. Rest assured, however, Lloyd Webber&#x27;s neo-Puccinian songs are reprised and reprised and reprised until you&#x27;re guaranteed to go out humming.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; believed Schumacher did not add enough dimension in adapting &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. &quot;Schumacher, the man who added nipples to Batman&#x27;s suit, has staged Phantom chastely, as if his job were to adhere the audience to every note&quot;.

Roger Ebert, who gave the film three stars out of four, reasoned that &quot;part of the pleasure of movie-going is pure spectacle—of just sitting there and looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific. There wasn&#x27;t much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed, but in the areas over which he held sway, he has triumphed.&quot; In contrasting between the popularity of the Broadway musical, Michael Dequina of &quot;Film Threat&quot; magazine explained that &quot;it conjures up this unexplainable spell that leaves audiences sad, sentimental, swooning, smiling—in some way transported and moved. Now, in Schumacher&#x27;s film, that spell lives on.&quot;

In a 2013 interview with Hollywood.com, Cameron Mackintosh, a co-producer on the stage musical who had nothing to do with this movie, said &quot;I would have wanted to do the film differently. This new version which we’ve done (a touring production with reimagined staging) is dangerous and gritty. It combines the world of upstage and the lair below. You see two different worlds. That would have been my approach to the film.&quot; In a 2021 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Andrew Lloyd Webber revealed that he personally felt director Joel Schumacher made a mistake in casting Gerard Butler. He said &quot;The Phantom was too young, and the whole point of the Phantom is he needs to be quite a bit older than Christine.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Taranto took place on the night of 11/12 November 1940 during the Second World War between British naval forces, under Admiral Andrew Cunningham, and Italian naval forces, under Admiral Inigo Campioni. The Royal Navy launched the first all-aircraft ship-to-ship naval attack in history, employing 21 Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea.

The attack struck the battle fleet of the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; at anchor in the harbour of Taranto, using aerial torpedoes despite the shallowness of the water. The success of this attack augured the ascendancy of naval aviation over the big guns of battleships. According to Admiral Cunningham, &quot;Taranto, and the night of 11–12 November 1940, should be remembered forever as having shown once and for all that in the Fleet Air Arm the Navy has its most devastating weapon.&quot;

==Origins==
Since long before the First World War, the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot;″s First Squadron had been based at Taranto, a port-city on Italy&#x27;s south-east coast. In the inter-war period, the British Royal Navy developed plans to counter the Italian navy in the event of a war in the Mediterranean. Plans for the capture of the port at Taranto were considered as early as the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935.

After Italy&#x27;s entry into World War II in 1940, British and Italian forces in North Africa engaged each other in the Western Desert Campaign. Italian troops based in Libya required a supply line from Italy. British troops, based in Egypt, suffered from much greater supply difficulties. Before Italy entered the war, British convoys had travelled across the Mediterranean, from Gibraltar via Malta to Egypt. However, the threat from the Italian navy and airforce made this very difficult. Instead, British ships steamed around the Cape of Good Hope, up the east coast of Africa, and then through the Suez Canal to reach Alexandria. 

Following the concept of a fleet in being, the Italians usually kept their warships in harbour and were unwilling to seek battle with the Royal Navy on their own, also because any ship lost larger than a destroyer could not be replaced. The Italian fleet at Taranto was powerful: six battleships (of which one was not yet battleworthy, having her crew still in training after her reconstruction), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and eight destroyers. This made the threat of a sortie against British shipping a serious problem.

During the Munich Crisis of 1938, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet, was concerned about the survival of the aircraft carrier in the face of Italian opposition in the Mediterranean, and ordered his staff to re-examine all plans for attacking Taranto. He was advised by Lumley Lyster, the captain of &quot;Glorious&quot;, that his Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers were capable of a night attack. Indeed, the Fleet Air Arm was then the only naval aviation arm with such a capability. Pound took Lyster&#x27;s advice and ordered training to begin. Security was kept so tight there were no written records. Just a month before the war began, Pound advised his replacement, Admiral Andrew Cunningham, to consider the possibility. This came to be known as Operation Judgment.

The fall of France and the consequent loss of the French fleet in the Mediterranean (even before Operation Catapult) made redress essential. The older carrier, , on Cunningham&#x27;s strength, was ideal, possessing a very experienced air group composed entirely of the obsolescent Swordfish aircraft. Three Sea Gladiator fighters were added for the operation. Firm plans were drawn up after the Italian Army halted at Sidi Barrani, which freed up the British Mediterranean Fleet.

Operation Judgment was just a small part of the overarching Operation MB8. It was originally scheduled to take place on 21 October 1940, Trafalgar Day, but a fire in an auxiliary fuel tank of one Swordfish led to a delay. auxiliary tanks were fitted in the observer&#x27;s position on torpedo bombers - the observer taking the air gunner&#x27;s position - to extend the operating range of the aircraft enough to reach Taranto. This minor fire spread into something more serious that destroyed two Swordfish. &quot;Eagle&quot; then suffered a breakdown in her fuel system, so she was removed from the operation.

When the brand-new carrier , based at Alexandria, became available in the Mediterranean, she took on board five Swordfish from &quot;Eagle&quot; and launched the strike alone.

The complete force, commanded by now-Rear Admiral Lyster, Flag Officer, Mediterranean Aircraft Carriers, who had originated the plan of attack on Taranto—consisted of &quot;Illustrious&quot;, the heavy cruisers and , the light cruisers and , and the destroyers , , and . The 24 attack Swordfish came from 813, 815, 819, and 824 Naval Air Squadrons. The small number of attacking warplanes raised concern that &quot;Judgment&quot; would only alert and enrage the Italian Navy without achieving any significant results. &quot;Illustrious&quot; also had Fairey Fulmar fighters of 806 Naval Air Squadron aboard to provide air cover for the task force, with radar and fighter control systems.
Half of the Swordfish were armed with torpedoes as the primary strike aircraft, with the other half carrying aerial bombs and flares to carry out diversions. These torpedoes were fitted with Duplex magnetic/contact exploders, which were extremely sensitive to rough seas, as the attacks on the German battleship later showed. There were also worries the torpedoes would bottom out in the harbour after being dropped. The loss rate for the bombers was expected to be fifty per cent.

Several reconnaissance flights by Martin Marylands of the RAF&#x27;s No. 431 General Reconnaissance Flight flying from Malta confirmed the location of the Italian fleet. These flights produced photos on which the intelligence officer of &quot;Illustrious&quot; spotted previously unexpected barrage balloons; the attack plan was changed accordingly. To make sure the Italian warships had not sortied, the British also sent over a Short Sunderland flying boat on the night of 11 November, just as the carrier task force was forming up off the Greek island of Cephalonia, about from Taranto harbour. This reconnaissance flight alerted the Italian forces in southern Italy, but since they were without any radars, they could do little but wait for whatever came along. The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; could conceivably have gone to sea in search of any British naval force, but this was distinctly against the naval philosophy of the Italians between January 1940 and September 1943.

The complexity of Operation MB8, with its various forces and convoys, succeeded in deceiving the Italians into thinking only normal convoying was under way. This contributed to the success of &quot;Judgment&quot;.

The base of Taranto was defended by 101 anti-aircraft guns and 193 machine guns and was usually protected against low-flying aircraft by barrage balloons, of which only 27 were in place on 11 November, as strong winds on 6 November had blown away 60 balloons. Capital ships were also supposed to be protected by anti-torpedo nets, but of netting was required for full protection, and only one-third of that was rigged before the attack due to a scheduled gunnery exercise. Moreover, these nets did not reach the bottom of the harbour, allowing the British torpedoes to clear them by about .

==Attack==
The first wave of 12 aircraft, led by Lieutenant Commander Kenneth &quot;Hooch&quot; Williamson RN of 815 Squadron, left &quot;Illustrious&quot; just before 21:00 hours on 11 November 1940, followed by a second wave of nine about 90 minutes later. Of the second wave, one aircraft turned back as its auxiliary fuel tank detached from the aircraft ensuring the aircraft would not be able to complete the trip, and one launched 20 minutes late, after requiring emergency repairs to damage following a minor taxiing accident, so only eight made it to the target.

The first wave, which consisted of six Swordfish armed with torpedoes, two with flares and four bombs, and four with six bombs, was split into two sections when three of the bombers and one torpedo bomber strayed from the main force while flying through thin clouds. The smaller group continued to Taranto independently. The main group approached the harbour at &quot;Mar Grande&quot; at 22:58. Sixteen flares were dropped east of the harbour, then the flare dropper and another aircraft made a dive bombing attack to set fire to oil tanks. The next three aircraft, led by Lieutenant Commander K Williamson RN of 815 Squadron, attacked over San Pietro Island, and struck the battleship with a torpedo that blasted a hole in her side below her waterline. Williamson&#x27;s plane was immediately shot down by the Italian battleship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns. The two remaining aircraft in this sub-flight continued, dodging barrage balloons and receiving heavy anti-aircraft fire from the Italian warships and shore batteries, to press home an unsuccessful attack on the battleship &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;. The next sub-flight of three attacked from a more northerly direction, attacking the battleship , hitting it with two torpedoes and launching one torpedo at the flagship, the battleship , which missed. The bomber force, led by Captain O. Patch RM, attacked next. They found the targets difficult to identify, but attacked and hit two cruisers moored at &quot;Mar Piccolo&quot; hitting both with a single bomb each from , followed by another aircraft that straddled four destroyers.

The second wave of eight aircraft, led by Lieutenant Commander J. D. Hale of 819 Squadron, was now approaching from a northerly direction towards the &quot;Mar Grande&quot; harbour, with two of the four bombers also carrying flares, the remaining five carrying torpedoes. Flares were dropped shortly before midnight. Two aircraft aimed their torpedoes at &quot;Littorio&quot;, one of which hit. One aircraft, despite having been hit twice by anti-aircraft fire, aimed a torpedo at &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; but the torpedo missed. Another aircraft hit the battleship with a torpedo, blowing a large hole in her hull and flooding both of her forward magazines. The aircraft flown by Lieutenant G. Bayley RN was shot down by antiaircraft fire from the heavy cruiser following the successful attack on &quot;Littorio&quot;, the only aircraft lost from the second wave. The final aircraft to arrive on the scene 15 minutes behind the others made an unsuccessful dive-bombing attack on one of the Italian cruisers despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, then safely returned to &quot;Illustrious&quot;, landing at 02:39.

Of the two aircraft shot down, the pilot and observer of the first (L4A), Lieutenant Commander K. Williamson, and Lieutenant N. J. &#x27;Blood&#x27; Scarlett respectively, were taken prisoner. The pilot and observer of the second aircraft (E4H), Lieutenant G. Bayley and Lieutenant H. Slaughter, were both killed.

The Italian battleships suffered significant damage:
* &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; had a hole in the hull, and permission to ground her was withheld until it was too late, so her keel touched the bottom at a deeper depth than intended. 27 of the ship&#x27;s crew were killed and over 100 more wounded. In the end, only her superstructure and main armament remained above water. She was subsequently raised, partially repaired and transferred to Trieste for further repairs and upgrades, but a changed situation put these works in low priority. She was still undergoing repairs when Italy surrendered, so she never returned to full service;
* &quot;Duilio&quot; had only a slightly smaller hole () and was saved by running her aground;

* &quot;Littorio&quot; had considerable flooding caused by three torpedo hits. Despite underwater protection (the Pugliese torpedo defense system, standard in all Italian battleships), the damage was extensive, although actual damage to the ship&#x27;s structures was relatively limited (the machinery was intact). Casualties were 32 crewmen killed and many wounded. She was holed in three places, once on the port side (), and twice on the starboard side ( and ). She too was saved by running her aground. Despite this, in the morning, the ship&#x27;s bows were totally submerged.

Italian defences fired 13,489 shells from the land batteries, while several thousand were fired from the ships. The anti-aircraft barrage was formidable, having 101 guns and 193 machine guns. There were also 87 balloons, but strong winds caused the loss of 60 of them. Only of anti-torpedo nets were actually fielded around the ships, up to in-depth, while the need was for . There were also 13 aerophonic stations and 22 searchlights (the ships had two searchlights each). Denis Boyd, Commanding Officer HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;, stated in his after-action report, &quot;It is notable that the enemy did not use the searchlights at all during either of the attacks.&quot;

&quot;Littorio&quot; was repaired with all available resources and was fully operational again within four months, while restoration of the older battleships proceeded at a much slower pace (repairs took seven months for &quot;Duilio&quot;, and the repairs for &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; were never completed). In all, the Swordfish attack was made with just 20 aircraft. Two Italian aircraft were destroyed on the ground by the bombing, and two unexploded bombs hit the cruiser and the destroyer &quot;Libeccio&quot;. Near misses damaged the destroyer &quot;Pessagno&quot;.

Meanwhile, X-Force cruisers attacked an Italian convoy (Battle of the Strait of Otranto). This force had three cruisers (, and ) and two s ( and ). Just past midnight, they met and destroyed four Italian merchantmen (&quot;Capo Vado&quot;, &quot;Catalani&quot;, &quot;Locatelli&quot; and &quot;Premuda&quot;), damaging the torpedo-boat , while the heavily out-gunned auxiliary cruiser &quot;Ramb III&quot; fled.

Cunningham and Lyster wanted to strike Taranto again the next night with Swordfish (six torpedo-bombers, seven bombers, and two flare-dispensers) – one wag in the pilots&#x27; room remarked, &quot;They only asked the Light Brigade to do it once!&quot; – but bad weather prevented the action.

==Aftermath==
The Italian fleet lost half of its capital ships in one night; the next day, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; transferred its undamaged ships from Taranto to Naples to protect them from similar attacks, until the defences at Taranto (mainly the anti-torpedo nets) were brought up to adequate levels to protect them from further attacks of the same kind (which happened between March and May 1941). Repairs to &quot;Littorio&quot; took about four months, to &quot;Duilio&quot; seven months; &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; required extensive salvage work and her repairs were incomplete when Italy surrendered in 1943. Cunningham wrote after the attack: &quot;The Taranto show has freed up our hands considerably &amp; I hope now to shake these damned up a bit. I don&#x27;t think their remaining three battleships will face us and if they do I&#x27;m quite prepared to take them on with only two.&quot; Indeed, the balance of power had swung to the British Mediterranean Fleet which now enjoyed more operational freedom: when previously forced to operate as one unit to match Italian capital ships, they could now split into two battlegroups; each built around one aircraft carrier and two battleships.

Nevertheless, Cunningham&#x27;s estimate that Italians would be unwilling to risk their remaining heavy units was quickly proven wrong. Only five days after Taranto, Campioni sortied with two battleships, six cruisers and 14 destroyers to successfully disrupt a mission to deliver aircraft to Malta. The follow-up to this operation led to the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940. Two of the three damaged battleships were repaired by mid-1941 and control of the Mediterranean continued to swing back and forth until the Italian armistice in 1943.

The attack on Taranto was avenged a year later by the Italian navy in its Raid on Alexandria, when the Mediterranean fleet of the Royal Navy was attacked using midget submarines, severely damaging the battleships and .

However, measured against its primary task of disrupting Axis convoys to Africa, the Taranto attack had very little effect. In fact, Italian shipping to Libya increased between the months of October 1940 – January 1941 to an average of 49,435 tons per month, up from the 37,204-ton average of the previous four months. Moreover, rather than change the balance of power in the central Mediterranean, British naval authorities had &quot;failed to deliver the true knockout blow that would have changed the context within which the rest of the war in the Mediterranean was fought.&quot;

Aerial torpedo experts in all modern navies had previously thought that torpedo attacks against ships must be in water at least deep. Taranto harbour had a depth of only about ; but the Royal Navy had developed a new method of preventing torpedoes from diving too deep. A drum was attached beneath the nose of the aircraft, from which a roll of wire led to the nose of the torpedo. As it dropped, the tension from the wire pulled up the nose of the torpedo, producing a belly-flop rather than a nose dive.

===Influence on Pearl Harbor===
It is likely the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s staff carefully studied the Taranto raid during planning for the attack on Pearl Harbor, as both attacks faced similar issues attacking a shallow harbour. Japanese Lieutenant Commander Takeshi Naito, the assistant naval attaché to Berlin, flew to Taranto to investigate the attack firsthand. Naito subsequently had a lengthy conversation with Commander Mitsuo Fuchida about his observations in October 1941. Fuchida led the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. More significant, perhaps, was a Japanese military mission to Italy in May 1941. A group of IJN officers visited Taranto and had lengthy discussions with their Italian Navy opposite numbers. However, the Japanese had been working on shallow-water solutions since early 1939, with various shallow ports as the notional targets, including Manila, Singapore, Vladivostok, and Pearl Harbor. In the early 1930s, as their Type 91 aerial torpedo entered service, the Japanese used a breakaway wooden nose to soften its impact with the water. As early as 1936, they perfected breakaway wooden fins for added aerial stability.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was a considerably larger operation than Taranto. All six Imperial Japanese fleet carriers, each one equipped with an air wing having over twice the number of planes of any British carrier, took part. It resulted in far more devastation; seven American battleships were sunk or disabled, and several other warships were destroyed or damaged. The U.S. Navy thereafter designed its fleet operations in the Pacific Ocean around its carriers instead of its battleships as capital ships. Battleships were found to be less useful in the expanses of the Pacific than in the confines of the Mediterranean; the older ships were too slow to escort the carriers and were chiefly used as fire support for amphibious operations.

<text>In polymer science, the polymer chain or simply backbone of a polymer is the main chain of a polymer. Polymers are often classified according to the elements in the main chains. The character of the backbone, i.e. its flexibility, determines the properties of the polymer (such as the glass transition temperature). For example, in polysiloxanes (silicone), the backbone chain is very flexible, which results in a very low glass transition temperature of . The polymers with rigid backbones are prone to crystallization (e.g. polythiophenes) in thin films and in solution. Crystallization in its turn affects the optical properties of the polymers, its optical band gap and electronic levels.

==Organic polymers==
Common synthetic polymers have main chains composed of carbon, i.e. C-C-C-C... Examples include polyolefins such as polyethylene ((CH2CH2)n) and many substituted derivative ((CH2CH(R))n) such as polystyrene (R = C6H5), polypropylene (R = CH3), and acrylates (R = CO2R&#x27;).

Other major classes of organic polymers are polyesters and polyamides. They have respectively -C(O)-O- and -C(O)-NH- groups in their backbones in addition to chains of carbon. Major commercial products are polyethyleneterephthalate (&quot;PET&quot;), ((C6H4CO2C2H4OC(O))n) and nylon-6 ((NH(CH2)5C(O))n).

==Inorganic polymers==

Siloxanes are a premier example of an inorganic polymer, even though they have extensive organic substituents. Their backbond is composed of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms, i.e. Si-O-Si-O... The silicon atoms bear two substituents, usually methyl as in the case of polydimethylsiloxane. Some uncommon but illustrative inorganic polymers include polythiazyl ((SN)x) with alternating S and N atoms, and polyphosphates ((PO3−)n).

==Biopolymers==
Major families of biopolymers are polysaccharides (carbohydrates), peptides, and polynucleotides. Many variants of each are known.

===Proteins and peptides===
Proteins are characterized by amide linkages (-N(H)-C(O)-) formed by the condensation of amino acids. The sequence of the amino acids in the polypeptide backbone is known as the primary structure of the protein. Like almost all polymers, protein fold and twist, forming into the secondary structure, which is rigidified by hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygens and amide hydrogens in the backbone, i.e. C=O---HN. Further interactions between residues of the individual amino acids form the protein&#x27;s tertiary structure. For this reason, the primary structure of the amino acids in the polypeptide backbone is the map of the final structure of a protein, and it therefore indicates its biological function. Spatial positions of backbone atoms can be reconstructed from the positions of alpha carbons using computational tools for the backbone reconstruction.
=== Carbohydrates ===
Carbohydrates arise by condensation of monosaccharides such as glucose. The polymers can be classified into oligosaccharides (up to 10 residues) and polysaccharides (up to about 50,000 residues). The backbone chain is characterized by an ether bond between individual monosaccharides. This bond is called the glycosidic linkage. These backbone chains can be unbranched (containing one linear chain) or branched (containing multiple chains). The glycosidic linkages are designated as &quot;alpha&quot; or &quot;beta&quot; depending on the relative stereochemistry of the anomeric (or most oxidized) carbon. In a Fischer Projection, if the glycosidic linkage is on the same side or face as carbon 6 of a common biological saccharide, the carbohydrate is designated as &quot;beta&quot; and if the linkage is on the opposite side it is designated as &quot;alpha&quot;. In a traditional &quot;chair structure&quot; projection, if the linkage is on the same plane (equatorial or axial) as carbon 6 it is designated as &quot;beta&quot; and on the opposite plane it is designated as &quot;alpha&quot;. This is exemplified in sucrose (table sugar) which contains a linkage that is &quot;alpha&quot; to glucose and &quot;beta&quot; to fructose. Generally, carbohydrates which our bodies break down are &quot;alpha&quot;-linked (example: glycogen) and those which have structural function are &quot;beta&quot;-linked (example: cellulose).

=== Nucleic acids ===

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the main examples of polynucleotides. They arise by condensation of nucleotides. Their backbones form by the condensation of a hydroxy group on a ribose with the phosphate group on another ribose. This linkage is called a phosphodiester bond. The condensation is catalyzed by enzymes called polymerases. DNA and RNA can be millions of nucleotides long thus allowing for the genetic diversity of life. The bases project from the pentose-phosphate polymer backbone and are hydrogen bonded in pairs to their complementary partners (A with T and G with C). This creates a double helix with pentose phosphate backbones on either side, thus forming a secondary structure.

<text>Notoryctidae are a family of marsupials comprising the marsupial moles and their fossil relatives. It is the only family in the order Notoryctemorphia.

== Taxonomy ==
A fossil species in a new genus was published as &quot;Naraboryctes&quot;. A new diagnosis for Notoryctidae was also provided in the species first description, as a consequence of the discovery of a fossil species in the family.

== Description ==
The group appear to have diverged from other marsupials at an early stage and are highly specialised to foraging through loose sand; the unusual features have seen the unique family placed in the taxonomic order Notoryctemorphia Aplin &amp; Archer, 1987. The eyes and external ears are absent in the modern species, the nose is shielded and mouth reduced in size, and they use pairs of well developed claws to move beneath the sand. The Australian animals resemble species known as moles, burrow building mammals found in other continents, and were collectively referred to as &#x27;marsupial moles&#x27;. The regional names for the well known animals, established before their published descriptions, are used to refer to the species.

The extant notoryctid species are subterranean, and are extremely well adapted to moving through sand plains and dunes, these are the two species of genus &quot;Notoryctes&quot; Stirling, 1891. The animals are known as &quot;itjaritjari&quot; (for the species &quot;N. typhlops)&quot; and kakarratul (for the species &quot;N. caurinus)&quot;.

The dental formula is I1-5/1-3, C1/1, P1-3/1-3, M1-4/1-4.

<text>The Exposition Universelle of 1900 (), better known in English as the 1900 Paris Exposition, was a world&#x27;s fair held in Paris, France, from 14 April to 12 November 1900, to celebrate the achievements of the past century and to accelerate development into the next. It was the sixth of ten major expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. It was held at the esplanade of Les Invalides, the Champ de Mars, the Trocadéro and at the banks of the Seine between them, with an additional section in the Bois de Vincennes, and it was visited by more than fifty million people. Many international congresses and other events were held within the framework of the exposition, including the 1900 Summer Olympics.

Many technological innovations were displayed at the Fair, including the &quot;Grande Roue de Paris&quot; ferris wheel, the &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Avenir&quot; moving sidewalk, the first ever regular passenger trolleybus line, escalators, diesel engines, electric cars, dry cell batteries, electric fire engines, talking films, the telegraphone (the first magnetic audio recorder), the galalith and the matryoshka dolls. It also brought international attention to the Art Nouveau style. Additionally, it showcased France as a major colonial power through numerous pavilions built on the hill of the Trocadéro Palace.

Major structures built for the exposition include the , the , the Pont Alexandre III, the Gare d&#x27;Orsay railroad station, and the Paris Métro Line 1 (including its entrances designed by Hector Guimard), all of which survive today (including two original canopied Métro entrances).

==Organization==
The first international exposition was held in London in 1851. The French Emperor Napoleon III attended and was deeply impressed. He commissioned the first Paris Universal Exposition of 1855. Its purpose was to promote French commerce, technology and culture. It was followed by another in 1867, and, after the Emperor&#x27;s downfall in 1870, another in 1878, celebrating national unity after the defeat of the Paris Commune, and then in 1889, celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution.

Planning for the 1900 Exposition began in 1892, under President Carnot, with Alfred Picard as Commissioner-General. Three French Presidents and ten Ministers of Commerce held office before it was completed. President Carnot died shortly before it was completed. Though many of the buildings were not finished, the exposition was opened on 14 April 1900 by President Émile Loubet.

===Participating nations===

Countries from around the world were invited by France to showcase their achievements and cultures. Of the fifty-six countries invited to participate with official representation, forty accepted, plus an additional number of colonies and protectorates of France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Portugal.

Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Hungary participated as independent nations, although belonging to Austria-Hungary at that time. Finland, although having a national pavilion located at the Rue des Nations, officially participated as part of Russia. Egypt, also with an own pavilion, participated as part of Turkey. The few exhibitors from countries without an official presence at the Fair participated under a joint &quot;International Section&quot;.

Among the colonies and protectorates present in the Fair were French Algeria, Cambodia, Congo, Dahomey, Guadeloupe, Guiana, Guinea, India, Indochina, Ivory Coast, Laos, Madagascar, Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Oceania, Réunion, Senegal, Somaliland, Sudan, Tonkin, Tunisia, West Africa, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the Dutch East Indies, British Canada, Ceylon, India and Western Australia and the Portuguese colonies.

==Exposition site==
The site of the exposition covered along the left and right banks of the Seine from the esplanade of Les Invalides to the Eiffel Tower (built for the 1889 Exposition) at the Champ de Mars. It also included the and on the right bank. An additional section of for agricultural exhibits and other structures was built in the Bois de Vincennes. The total area of the exposition, , was ten times larger than the 1855 Exposition.

The exposition buildings were meant to be temporary; they were built on iron frames covered with plaster and staff, a kind of inexpensive artificial stone. Many of the buildings were unfinished when the exposition opened, and most were demolished immediately after it closed.

===The Porte Monumentale===
The Porte Monumentale de Paris, located on the Place de la Concorde, was the main entrance of the exposition. The architect of the monument overall was René Binet, although many others contributed to the constituent parts. His overall design was inspired by the biological studies of Ernst Haeckel. It was composed of towering polychrome ceramic decoration in Byzantine motifs, crowned by a statue high called &quot;La Parisienne&quot;. Unlike classical statues, she was dressed in modern Paris fashion. &quot;La Parisienne&quot; was executed by sculptor Paul Moreau-Vauthier who collaborated with Paris&#x27; pre-eminiment haute couturier of the day, Jeanne Paquin, who designed the figure&#x27;s fashionable attire. Below the statue was a sculptural prow of a boat, the symbol of Paris, and friezes depicting the workers who built the exposition. The central arch was flanked by two slender, candle-like towers, resembling minarets. The gateway was brightly illuminated at night by 3,200 light bulbs and an additional forty arc lamps. Forty thousand visitors an hour could pass beneath the arch to approach the twenty-six ticket booths. Above the ticket booth windows, the names of provincial cities were inscribed, symbolically enacting a hierarchical relation between Paris and the provinces.

The structure of the entrance tower as a whole was adorned with Byzantine motifs and Persian ceramic ornamentation, but the true inspiration behind the piece was not of cultural background. Binet sought inspiration from science, tucking the vertebrae of a dinosaur, the cells of a beehive, rams, peacocks, and poppies into the design alongside other animalistic stimuli.

The Gateway, like the exposition buildings, was intended to be temporary, and was demolished as soon as the exposition was finished. The ceramic frieze depicting the workers of the exposition was designed by Anatole Guillot, an academic sculptor. The workers frieze was preserved by the head of the ceramics firm that made it, Émile Müller, and moved to what is now Parc Müller in the town of Breuillet, Essonne. The workers were situated above a frieze of animals designed by sculptor Paul Jouve and executed by ceramicist Alexandre Bigot.

===The Pont Alexandre III===
The Pont Alexandre III was an essential link of the exposition, connecting the pavilions and palaces on the left and right banks of the Seine. It was named after Czar Alexander III of Russia, who had died in 1894, and celebrated the recent alliance between France and Russia. The foundation stone was laid by his son, Czar Nicholas II in 1896, and the bridge was finished in 1900. It was the work of engineers Jean Resal and Amédée D&#x27;Alby and architect Gaston Cousin. The widest and longest of the Paris bridges at the time, it was constructed on a single arch of steel long. Though it was named after the Russian Czar, the themes of the decoration were almost entirely French. At the ends, the bridge was supported by four massive stone pylons high, decorated with statues of the &quot;Renomées&quot; (The Renowned), female figures with trumpets, and gilded statues of the horse Pegasus. At the base of the pedestals are allegorical statues representing the France of Charlemagne, the France of the Renaissance, the France of Louis XIV and France in 1900. The Russian element was in the center, with statuary of the Nymphs of the Neva River holding a gilded seal of the Russian Empire. At the same time that the Pont Alexander III was built, a similar bridge, the Trinity Bridge was built in Saint-Petersburg, and was dedicated to French-Russian friendship by French President Félix Faure.

==Thematic pavilions==
To house the industrial, commercial, scientific, technological and cultural exhibitions, the French organization built huge thematic pavilions on the esplanade of Les Invalides and the Champ de Mars and reused the Galerie des machines from the 1889 Exposition. On the other bank of the Seine, they built the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais for the fine arts exhibitions.

The 83,047 French and foreign exhibitors at the Fair were divided into eighteen groups based on their subject matter, which in turn were divided into 121 classes, and based on the class to which they belonged, they were allocated in the corresponding official thematic pavilion. Each thematic pavilion was divided into national sections, which were the responsibility of the corresponding country and where its exhibitors were located. Some country with a strong presence in a specific sector, at its own request, was even granted a plot adjoining to the main building to build a small pavilion to house its exhibitors.

===The Palaces of Optics, Illusions and Aquarium===
Twenty-one of the thirty-three official pavilions were devoted to technology and the sciences. Among the most popular was the Palace of Optics, whose main attractions included the Great Paris Exposition Telescope, which enlarged the image of the moon ten thousand times. The image was projected on a screen in size, in a hall which seated two thousand visitors. This telescope was the largest refracting telescope at that time. The optical tube assembly was long and in diameter, and was fixed in place due to its mass. Light from the sky was sent into the tube by a movable mirror.

Another very popular feature of the Palace of Optics was the giant kaleidoscope, which attracted three million visitors. Other features of the optics pavilion included demonstrations of X-rays and dancers performing in phosphorescent costumes.

The Palais des Illusions (Palace of Illusions), adjoining the Palace of Optics, was an extremely popular exhibition. It was a large hall which used mirrors and electric lighting to create a show of colorful and bizarre optical illusions. It was preserved after the exposition in the Musée Grévin.

Another scientific attraction was the aquarium, the largest in the world at the time, viewed from an underground gallery long. The water tanks were each long, wide and deep, and contained a wide selection of exotic marine life.

===The Palace of Electricity and the Water Castle===
The Palace of Electricity and the adjoining Water Castle (&quot;Chateau d&#x27;Eau&quot;), designed by architects Eugène Hénard and Edmond Paulin, were among the most popular sights. The Palace of Electricity was built partly incorporating architectural elements of the old Palace of the Champ de Mars from the 1889 Exposition. The Palace was enormous, long and wide, and its form suggested a giant peacock spreading its tail. The central tower was crowned by an enormous illuminated star and a chariot carrying a statue of the Spirit of Electricity high, holding aloft a torch powered by 50,000 volts of electricity, provided by the steam engines and generators inside the Palace. Electrical lighting was used extensively to keep the Fair open well into the night. Producing the light for the exposition consumed of oil an hour. The facade of the Palace and the Water Castle, across from it, were lit by an additional 7,200 incandescent lamps and seventeen arc lamps. Visitors could go inside to see the steam-powered generators which provided electricity for the buildings of the exposition.

The Water castle, facing the Palace of Electricity, had an equally imposing appearance. It had two large domes, between which was a gigantic fountain, circulating of water a minute. Thanks to the power from Palace of Electricity, the fountain was illuminated at night by continually changing colored lights.

===The Grand Palais and Petit Palais===
The , officially the &quot;Grand Palais des beaux-arts et des arts decoratifs&quot;, was built on the right bank upon the site of the Palace of Industry of the 1855 Exposition. It was the work of two architects, Henri Deglane for the main body of the building, and Albert Thomas for the west wing, or Palais d&#x27;Antin. The iron frame of the was quite modern for its time; it appeared light, but in fact, it used of metal, compared with seven thousand for the construction of the Eiffel Tower. The facade was in the ornate Beaux-Arts style or Neo-Baroque style. The more modern interior iron framework, huge skylights and stairways offered decorative elements in the new Art Nouveau style, particularly in the railings of the staircase, which were intricately woven in fluid, organic forms. During the Fair, the interior served as the setting for the exhibitions of paintings and sculptures. The main body of the housed the &quot;Exposition décennale des beaux-arts de 1889 à 1900&quot; with the paintings of French artists in the north wing, the paintings of artists from other countries in the south wing and the sculptures in the central hall, with some outdoor sculptures nearby. The Palais d&#x27;Antin, or west wing, housed the &quot;Exposition centennale de l&#x27;art français de 1800 à 1889&quot;.

The , that is facing the , was designed by Charles Girault. Much like the , the facade is Beaux-Arts and Neo-Baroque, reminiscent of the Grand Trianon and the stable at Chantilly. The interior offers examples of Art Nouveau, particularly in the railings of the curving stairways, the tiles of the floors, the stained glass, and the murals on the ceiling of the arcade around the garden. The entrance murals were painted by Paul-Albert Besnard and Paul Albert Laurens. During the Fair, the housed the &quot;Exposition rétrospective de l&#x27;art français des origines à 1800&quot;.

===The Palaces of Industry, Decoration and Agriculture===
The industrial and commercial exhibits were located inside several large palaces on the esplanade between les Invalides and the Alexander III Bridge. One of the largest and most ornate was the Palais des Manufactures Nationale, whose facade included a colorful ceramic gateway, designed by sculptor Jules Coutan and architect Charles Risler and made by the Sèvres Porcelain manufactory. After the exposition it was moved to the wall of Square Felix-Déésroulles, next to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where it can be seen today.

The Palace of Furniture and Decoration was particularly lavish and presented many displays of the new Art Nouveau style.

The Palace of Agriculture and Food was inside the former Galerie des machines, an enormous iron-framed building from the 1889 Exposition. Its most popular feature was the Champagne Palace, offering displays and samples of French Champagne.

==National pavilions==
Fifty-six countries were invited to the exposition, and forty accepted. The Rue des Nations was created along the banks of the Seine between the esplanade of Les Invalides and the Champ de Mars for the national pavilions of the larger countries. Each country paid for its own pavilion. The pavilions were all temporary, made of plaster and &quot;staff&quot; on a metal frame and were designed in an architectural style that represented a period in the country&#x27;s history, often imitating famous national monuments.

At the Rue des Nations, on the left bank of the Seine, on the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, overlooking the river, from the Pont des Invalides towards the Pont de l&#x27;Alma, were located the national pavilions of Italy, Turkey, the United States, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Great Britain, Belgium, Norway, Germany, Spain, Monaco, Sweden, Greece, Serbia and Mexico. Behind them, in second line, were located the pavilions of Denmark, Portugal, Peru, Persia, Finland, Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Romania. The other nations were located elsewhere in the exposition site.

In addition to their own national pavilion, the countries managed other spaces at the Fair. The industrial, commercial, scientific and cultural exhibitors of each country were distributed among the national sections of the different official thematic pavilions.

===The Rue des Nations===
The pavilion of Turkey was designed by a French architect, Adrien-René Dubuisson, and was a mixture of copies of Islamic architecture from mosques in Istanbul and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire. Turkey managed of exhibition space at the Fair.

The United States pavilion was modest, a variation on the United States Capitol Building designed by Charles Allerton Coolidge and Georges Morin-Goustiaux. The main U.S. presence was in the commercial and industrial palaces. One unusual aspect of the U.S. presence was The Exhibit of American Negroes at the Palace of Social Economy, a joint project of Daniel Murray, the Assistant Librarian of Congress, Thomas J. Calloway, a lawyer and the primary organizer of the exhibit, and W. E. B. Du Bois. The goal of the exhibition was to demonstrate progress and commemorate the lives of African Americans at the turn of the century. The exhibit included a statuette of Frederick Douglass, four bound volumes of nearly 400 official patents by African Americans, photographs from several educational institutions (Fisk University, Howard University, Roger Williams University, Tuskegee Institute, Claflin University, Berea College, North Carolina A&amp;T), and, most memorably, some five hundred photographs of African-American men and women, homes, churches, businesses and landscapes including photographs from Thomas E. Askew.

The pavilions of the Austro-Hungarian domains in the Balkans, Bosnia and Herzegovina, offered displays on their lifestyles, consisting of folklore traditions, highlighting peasanthood and the embroidery goods produced in the country. Designed by Karl Panek, it featured murals on the history of Slavic peoples by Alphonse Mucha.

The pavilion of Hungary was designed by Zoltán Bálint and Lajos Jámbor. Its cupola displayed agricultural produce and hunting equipment.

The British Royal pavilion consisted of a mock-Jacobean mansion designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens that was decorated with pictures and furniture. The furnishings designed by Nellie Whichelo included hangings that were more than , which had taken 56 ladies six weeks to embroider. The pavilion was largely used for receptions for important visitors to the exposition.

The German pavilion was the tallest, at , designed by Johannes Radke and built of wood and stained glass. However, most of the German presence at the exposition was in the commercial pavilions, where they had important displays of German technology and machinery, as well as models of German steamships and a full-scale model of a German lighthouse.

The Royal Pavilion of Spain was designed in Neo-Plateresque style by José Urioste Velada. It housed the Retrospective Exhibition of Spanish Art formed by the collection of tapestries, in which thirty-seven pieces made between the 15th and 18th centuries from the Royal Collections were exhibited. The pavilion basement housed a Spanish-themed café-restaurant, named &quot;La Feria&quot;, that was the first restaurant in History with a completely electric kitchen.

Sweden&#x27;s yellow and red structure covered in pine shingles drew attention with its bright colours. It was designed by Ferdinand Boberg.

Serbia presented itself with a pavilion resembling a church, in the Serbo-Byzantine style whose main architect was Milan Kapetanović from Belgrade, in cooperation with architect Milorad Ruvidić. Serbia presented numerous products at the exposition, such as wine, food, fabrics, minerals and won a total of 19 gold, 69 silver and 98 bronze medals. Some of the Serbian fine art on display were the painting &quot;The Proclamation of Dušan&#x27;s Law Codex&quot; by Paja Jovanović and &quot;Monument to heroes of Kosovo&quot; by Đorđe Jovanović, which stands today in Kruševac.

The pavilion of Finland, designed by Gesellius, Lindgren, Saarinen, had clean-cut, modern architecture.

===Nations located elsewhere===
Russia had an imposing presence on the Trocadéro hill. The Russian pavilion, designed by Robert Meltzer, was inspired by the towers of the Kremlin and had exhibits and architecture presenting artistic treasures from Samarkand, Bukhara and other Russian dependencies in Central Asia.

The Chinese pavilion, designed by Louis Masson-Détourbet, was in the form of a Buddhist temple with staff in Chinese traditional dress. This pavilion suffered some disruption in August 1900, when anti-Western rebels seized the International delegations in Beijing in the Boxer Rebellion and held them for several weeks until an expeditionary force from the Eight-Nation Alliance arrived and recaptured the city. During the disruption at the Fair, a Chinese procession was attacked by angered Parisians.

The Korean pavilion, designed by Eugène Ferret, was mostly stocked by French Oriental collectors, including Victor Collin de Plancy, with a supplement of Korean goods from Korea. One object of note on display was the &quot;Jikji&quot;, the oldest extant book printed with movable metal type.

Morocco had its pavilion near the Eiffel Tower and was designed by Henri-Jules Saladin.

==Colonial pavilions==
An area of several dozen hectares on the hill of the Trocadéro Palace was set aside for the pavilions of the colonies and protectorates of France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Portugal.

The largest space was for the French colonies in Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific and Southeast Asia. These pavilions featured traditional architecture of the countries and displays of local products mixed with modern electric lighting, motion pictures, dioramas, and guides, soldiers, and musicians in local costumes. The French Caribbean islands promoted their rum and other products, while the French colony of New Caledonia highlighted its exotic varieties of wood and its rich mineral deposits.

The North African French colonies were especially present; The Tunisian pavilion was a miniature recreation of the Sidi Mahrez Mosque of Tunis. Algeria, Sudan, Dahomey, Guinea and the other French African colonies presented pavilions based on their traditional religious architecture and marketplaces, with guides in costume.

The French colonies of Indochina, Tonkin and Cambodia also had an impressive presence, with recreations of pagodas and palaces, musicians and dancers, and a recreation of a riverside village from Laos.

The Netherlands displayed the exotic culture of its crown colony, the Dutch East Indies. The pavilion displayed a faithful reconstruction of 8th-century Sari temple and also Indonesian vernacular architecture of Rumah Gadang from Minangkabau, West Sumatra.

==Attractions==
Besides its official scientific, industrial and artistic palaces, the exposition offered an extraordinary variety of attractions, amusements and diversions.

===Eiffel Tower===
The Eiffel Tower, that was built as the main entrance of the 1889 Exposition, was the main and central attraction of the 1900 Exposition. For this exposition, it was repainted in shaded tones from yellow-orange at the base to light yellow at the top, and was fitted with 7,000 electric lamps. At the same time, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level and the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level.

===The Grande Roue de Paris===

The &quot;Grande Roue de Paris&quot; was a very popular attraction. It was a gigantic ferris wheel high, which took its name from a similar wheel created by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It could carry 1,600 passengers in its forty cars in a single voyage. The cost of a ride was one franc for a second class car, and two francs for a more spacious first-class car. Despite the high price, passengers often had to wait an hour for a place.

===The moving sidewalk, electric train and electrobus===

The &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Avenir&quot; () moving sidewalk was a very popular and useful attraction, given the large size of the exposition. It ran along the edge of the exposition, from the esplanade of Les Invalides to the Champ de Mars, passing through nine stations along the way, where passengers could board. The fare was an average of fifty centimes. The sidewalk was accessed from a platform above the ground level. The passengers stepped from the platform onto the moving sidewalk traveling at , then onto a more rapid sidewalk moving at . The sidewalks had posts with handles which passengers could hold onto, or they could walk. It was designed by architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee and engineer Max E. Schmidt.

A Decauville electric train followed the same route, running at an average speed of in the opposite direction of the moving sidewalk. The rail track was sometimes at high like the movable sidewalks, sometimes at ground level and sometimes underground.

An experimental passenger electrobus line, designed by Louis Lombard-Gérin, ran in the Bois de Vincennes from 2 August to 12 November 1900. It was a long circular route connecting the recently opened Porte de Vincennes metro station with Lac Daumesnil. It was the first trolleybus in regular passenger service in History.

===The Globe Céleste===

The &quot;Globe Céleste&quot; was an immense globe-shaped planetarium which offered a presentation on the night sky. The globe, designed by Napoléon de Tédesco, was in diameter, and the blue and gold exterior was painted with the constellations and the signs of the zodiac. It was placed atop a masonry support high, supported by four columns. A flower garden on the support surrounded the globe. Spectators seated in armchairs inside watched a presentation on the stars and planets projected overhead.

The sphere was the scene of a fatal accident on 29 April 1900 when one of access ramps, hastily made of a newly introduced material, reinforced concrete, collapsed onto the street below, killing nine people. Following the accident the French government established the first regulations for the use of reinforced concrete.

===Motion pictures===

The Lumière brothers, who had made the first public projections of a motion picture in 1895, presented their films on a colossal screen, by , in the Gallery of Machines. Another innovation in motion pictures was presented at the exposition at the Phono-Cinema Theater; a primitive talking motion picture, where the image on the screen was synchronized to the sound from phonographs.

An even more ambitious experiment in motion pictures was the &quot;Cinéorama&quot; of Raoul Grimoin Sanson, which simulated a voyage in a balloon. The film, projected on a circular screen in circumference by ten synchronized projectors, depicted a landscape passing below. The spectators sat in the center above the projectors, in what resembled the basket suspended beneath a large balloon.

Another popular attraction was the &quot;Mareorama&quot;, which simulated a voyage by ship from Villefranche to Constantinople. The viewers stood on the railing of a ship simulator, watching painted images pass by of the cities and seascapes en route. The illusion was aided by machinery that rocked the ship, and fans which blew gusts of wind.

===World live recreations===
&quot;L&#x27;Andalousie au temps des Maures&quot; () was a Spanish-themed open air attraction with folkloric live performances at Quai Debilly, at the western end of Trocadéro, on the right bank of the Seine, featuring full-scale moorish architecture reproductions from the Alhambra, Córdoba, Toledo, the Alcázar of Seville and a tall reproduction of the Giralda. It was a French-produced attraction that had no relation with the official representation of Spain at the Fair.

&quot;Le Vieux Paris&quot; () was a recreation of the streets of old Paris, from the Middle Ages to the 18th century, with recreations of historic buildings and streets filled with performers and musicians in costumes. It was built following an idea by Albert Robida. There were also several recreations depicting picturesque or touristic regions of France, including exhibitions from Provence, Bretagne, Poitou, Berry and Auvergne, using their pre-revolutionary provincial names rather than their departments. Provence was represented by two reconstructions, a Provençal farmhouse or &quot;mas&quot; and a reconstruction called &quot;Vieil Arles&quot; which reconstructed certain Roman ruins and part of the town&#x27;s cathedral.

The Swiss Village, at the edge of the exposition near Avenue de Sufren and Motte-Piquet, was a recreation of a Swiss mountainside village, complete with a cascade, a lake and collection of thirty-five chalets.

The &quot;Panorama du Tour du Monde&quot; was an animated panorama journey from Europe to Japan in a building by Alexandre Marcel in the architectural styles of India, China, Cambodia, Japan and Renaissance Europe. It consisted in panoramic paintings by Louis Dumoulin in front of which groups of native people, dressed accordingly, move, play, dance, stroll or work. The visitor traveled through representations of Fuenterrabía (Spain), the Pnyx hill in Athens (Greece), the cemetery of Stamboul and the Golden Horn of Constantinople (Turkey), Syria, the Suez Canal (Egypt), Ceylon, the Angkor Wat temple (Cambodia), Shanghai (China) and Nikkō (Japan). The visit continued by showing dioramas of Rome, Moscow, New York and Amsterdam and ended with a mobile panorama of a boat trip along the coast of Provence, from Marseille to La Ciotat. It was funded and sponsored by the &quot;Compagnie des messageries maritimes&quot;.

Other recreations with costumed vendors and musicians elsewhere the exposition included recreations of the bazaars, souks and street markets of Algiers, Tunis and Laos, a Venetian canal with gondolas, a Russian village and a Japanese tea house.

===Theatres and music halls===
The exposition had several large theatres and music halls, the largest of which was the Palais des Fêtes, which had fifteen thousand seats, and offered programs of music, ballet, historical recreations and diverse spectacles. A separate thoroughfare of the exposition, the Rue de Paris, was lined with amusements, including music venues, a comedy theater, marionettes, American jazz, a Grand Guignol theater, and the celebrated &quot;Backwards House&quot;, which had its furniture on the ceiling, its chandeliers on the floor, and windows which gave reverse images. Other diversions elsewhere in and around the exposition included an orchestra from Madagascar, a Comedy Theater, and the Columbia Theater at Port Maillot, with acts ranging from panoramas of life in the Orient to a water ballet. These diversions were popular but expensive; entry to the Comedy Theater cost up to five francs.

The most celebrated actress during the exposition was Sarah Bernhardt, who had her own theater, The Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt (now the Théâtre de la Ville), and premiered one of her most famous roles during the exposition. This was &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, a new play by Edmond Rostand in which she played the Duc de Reichstadt, the son of Napoleon Bonaparte, imprisoned by his unloving mother and family until his melancholy death in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna. The play ended with a memorable death scene; according to one critic, she died &quot;as dying angels would die if they were allowed to.&quot; The play ran for nearly a year, with standing-room places selling for as much as 600 gold francs.

Another popular diversion during the exposition was the theater of the American dancer, Loie Fuller, who performed a famous Serpentine dance in which she waved large silk scarves which seemed to envelop her into a cloud. Her performance was widely reproduced in photographs, paintings and drawings by Art Nouveau artists and sculptors, and were captured in very early motion pictures. She was filmed on ten 70mm projectors that created a 330-degree picture, patented by Cinéorama.

==Events==
Many international congresses and other events were held in Paris in 1900 within the framework of the exposition. A large area within the Bois de Vincennes was set aside for sporting events, which included, among others, many of the events of the 1900 Summer Olympics. A chess tournament was also held.

===1900 Summer Olympics Games===

The 1900 Summer Olympics were the second modern Olympics games held, and the first ones held outside Greece. Between 14 May and 28 October 1900, an enormous number of sporting activities were held along the exposition. The sporting events rarely used the term of &quot;Olympic&quot;. Indeed, the term &quot;Olympic Games&quot; was replaced by &quot;Concours internationaux d&#x27;exercices physiques et de sport&quot; () in the official report of the exposition. The press reported competitions variously as &quot;International Championships&quot;, &quot;International Games&quot;, &quot;Paris Championships&quot;, &quot;World Championships&quot; and &quot;Grand Prix of the Paris Exposition&quot;. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had no real control over the organization, no official interpretation has ever been made and various sources list differing events, further adding to the confusion that was Paris 1900.

According to the IOC, 997 competitors took part in nineteen different sports, including women competing for the first time. A number of events were held for the first and only time in Olympic history, including automobile and motorcycle racing, ballooning, cricket, croquet, a swimming obstacle race and underwater swimming. France provided 72 percent of all athletes (720 of the 997) and won the most gold, silver and bronze medal placings. The United States athletes won the second largest number, with just 75 of the 997 athletes. The pigeon race was won by a bird that flew from Paris to its home in Lyon in four and a half hours. The free balloon competition race was won by a balloon which travelled from Paris to Russia in 35 hours and 45 minutes.

===Banquet des maires===
Another special event at the exposition was a gigantic banquet hosted by the French President, Émile Loubet, for 20,777 mayors of France, Algeria and towns in French colonies, hosted on 22 September 1900 in the Tuileries Gardens, inside two enormous tents. The dinner was prepared in eleven kitchens and served to 606 tables, with the orders and needs of each table supervised by telephone and vehicle.

===Medals and awards ceremony===

The organizers of the exposition were not miserly in recognizing the 83,047 exhibitors of products, about half of whom came from France, and 7,161 from the United States. The awards ceremony was held on 18 August 1900, and was attended by 11,500 persons. 3,156 grand prizes were handed out, 8,889 gold medals, 13,300 silver medals, 12,108 bronze medals, and 8,422 honorable mentions. Many of the participants, such as Campbell&#x27;s Soup or Michigan Stove Company, added the Paris award to the advertisements and labels of their products.

==Admission charges and cost==

The cost of an admission ticket was one franc. At the time, the average hourly wage for Paris workers was between forty and fifty centimes. In addition, most popular attractions charged an admission fee, usually between fifty centimes and a franc. The average cost of a simple meal at the exposition was 2.50 francs, the half-day wages of a worker.
The amount budgeted for the Paris Exposition was one hundred million francs; twenty million from the French State, twenty million from the City of Paris, and the remaining sixty million expected to come from admissions, and backed by French banks and financial institutions.

The official final cost was 119 million francs, while the total amount actually collected from admission fees was 126 million francs. However, there were unplanned expenses of twenty-two million francs for the French State, and six million francs for the City of Paris, bringing the total cost to 147 million francs, or a deficit of twenty-one million francs. The deficit was to a degree offset by the long-term additions to the city infrastructure; new buildings and bridges, including the Grand and Petit Palais, the Pont Alexander III and the Passerelle Debilly; and additions to the transport system; The Paris Métro Line 1, the funicular railway on Montmartre, and two new train stations, the Gare d&#x27;Orsay and the Gare des Invalides, and the new facade and enlargement and redecoration of the Gare de Lyon and other stations.

The exposition was so expensive to organize and run that the cost per visitor ended up being about six hundred francs more than the price of admission. The exhibition lost a grand total of 82,000 francs after six months in operation. Many Parisians had invested money in bonds sold to raise money for the event and therefore lost their investment. With a much larger than expected turnout the exhibit sites had gone up in value. Continuing to pay rent for the sites became increasingly hard for concessionaires as they were receiving fewer customers than anticipated. The concessionaires then went on strike, which ultimately resulted in the closure of a large part of the exposition. To resolve the matter, the concessionaires were given a fractional refund of the rent they had paid.

==Art Nouveau at the exposition==
The Art Nouveau (&quot;New Art&quot;) style, taking its name from S.Bing&#x27;s store L&#x27;Art Nouveau, began to appear in Belgium and France in the 1890s and became fashionable in Europe and the United States. It was highly decorative and took its inspiration from the natural world, particularly from the curving lines of plants and flowers and other vegetal forms. The architecture of the exposition was largely of the Belle Epoque style and Beaux-Arts style, or of eclectic national styles. The store L&#x27;Art Nouveau presented a small pavilion at the exposition showcasing furniture and interior design in the new style. Art Nouveau style decoration appeared in the interiors and decoration of many of the other buildings, notably the interior ironwork and decoration of the Monumental gateway of the exposition, the and the , and in the portal of the Palace of National Industries.

The Art Nouveau style was very popular in the pavilions of decorative arts. The jewelry firm of Fouquet and the glass and crystal manufactory of Lalique all presented collections of Art Nouveau objects. The Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory created a series of monumental swan vases for the exposition, as well as the monumental entrance to the Palace of National Manufacturers.

Many exposition posters also made use of the Art Nouveau style. The work of the most famous Art Nouveau poster artist, Alfons Mucha, had many forms at the exposition. He designed the posters for the official Austrian participation in the exposition, painting murals depicting scenes from the history of Bosnia as well as the menu for the restaurant at the Bosnian pavilion, and designed the menu for the official opening banquet. He produced displays for the jeweler Georges Fouquet and the perfume maker Houbigant, with statuettes and panels of women depicting the scents of rose, orange blossom, violet and buttercup. His more serious art works, including his drawings for &quot;Le Pater&quot;, were shown in the Austrian pavilion and in the Austrian section of the . Some of his murals can be seen now in the .

The most famous appearance was in the entrances of the stations of the Paris Métro designed by Hector Guimard. It also appeared in the interior decoration of many popular restaurants, notably the Pavillon Bleu at the exposition, Maxim&#x27;s, and the Le Train Bleu restaurant of the Gare de Lyon, and in the portal of the Palace of National Manufacturers made by the Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory.

The exposition was a showcase not only of French Art Nouveau, but also the variations that had appeared in other parts of Europe, including the furniture of the Belgian architect and designer Victor Horta, designs of the German Jugendstil by Bruno Möhring, and of the Vienna Secession of Otto Wagner. Their display at the exposition brought the new style international attention.

==Legacy==
Most of the palaces and buildings constructed for the Exposition Universelle were demolished after the conclusion of the exposition and all items and materials that could be salvaged were sold or recycled. They were built largely of wood and covered with staff, which was formed into columns, statuary, walls, stairs. A few of the major structures built for the exposition were preserved, including the and the , and the two major bridges, the Pont Alexandre III and the Passerelle Debilly, though the latter was later dismantled and moved a few dozen meters from its original placement.

The Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) installed a total of 141 of the Art Nouveau metro station entrances designed by Hector Guimard –with and without canopy– between 1900 and 1913. In 1978, the 86 entrances that still existed were protected as historical monuments and have been preserved to this day, including two original canopied ones: at Porte Dauphine, on its original site and with the wall panels, and at Abbesses (moved from in 1974). A third canopied entrance at Châtelet is a 2000 recreation. None of the three pavilion-type entrances designed by Guimard have survived.

The monumental portal of the Palace of National Manufacturers, made by the Sèvres Manufactory, was preserved and moved to Square Felix-Desruelles, next to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

A copy of the Statue of Liberty by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi exhibited at the Fair, was placed in the Luxembourg Gardens in 1905 at the request of his widow.

After visiting the &quot;Panorama du Tour du Monde&quot;, King Leopold II of Belgium commissioned the architect of the building, Alexandre Marcel, to build a Japanese tower and a Chinese pavilion in the Royal Domain of Laeken, Brussels, Belgium. Marcel rebuilt there the Japanese red pagoda of the &quot;Panorama du Tour du Monde&quot; (now known as the Japanese Tower) and moved there the original entry pavilion to the tower from Paris. He also built the Chinese Pavilion whose wooden panelling was sculpted in Shanghai. Both structures are now part of the Museums of the Far East.

One of the most curious vestiges is La Ruche, at 2 Passage de Dantzig (15th arrondissement). This is a three-story building constructed entirely out of bits and pieces of exposition buildings, purchased at auctions by sculptor Alfred Boucher. The iron roof, made by Gustave Eiffel, originally covered the kiosk of the Wines of Médoc, in the palace of agriculture and foods. The statues of women in theatrical costumes by the front door came from the Indochina pavilion, while the ornamental iron gate at the entrance was part of the Palace of Women. In the years after the exposition, La Ruche served as the temporary studio and home of dozens of young artists and writers including Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani, Fernand Léger and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire. It was threatened with demolition in the 1960s but was saved by culture minister André Malraux. It is now a historical monument.

==Criticism==
The exposition had numerous critics from different points of view.

===The Porte Monumentale===
Response to the monumental gateway was mixed, with some critics comparing it to a pot-bellied stove. It was described as &quot;lacking in taste&quot; and was considered by some critics to be the ugliest of all the exhibits. &quot;La Parisienne&quot;, made by Moreau-Vauthier, was referred to by some as &quot;the triumph of prostitution&quot; because of her flowing robe and modernized figure and was criticized by many visitors.

The interior of the central dome had niches holding large sculptures. One was described as both a personification of electricity and as Salammbô, Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s infamous Carthaginian &quot;femme fatale&quot;, who was a symbol of light. La Porte Monumental is considered to be a structure of the Salammbô style and &#x27;the most typically 1900 monument of the entire exhibition&#x27;.

The controversial gateway became known as &quot;La Salamanda&quot; among the public because it resembled the stocky and intricately designed salamander-stoves of the time, only adding to its ridicule.

==In literature==
The American memoirist and historian Henry Adams wrote about the exposition in &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot;, in a chapter titled &quot;The Dynamo and the Virgin.&quot; Adams used the occasion to ruminate upon the implications of the Machine Age, expressing concern over what he perceived to be a clash between technology (&quot;the dynamo,&quot; a reference to the new engines on display) and the tradition of art and spirituality (&quot;the Virgin,&quot; in reference to displays of older artwork) in addressing human needs. The chapter is considered to be an early iteration of the conversations about technology and life that continued in the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Motion picture footage==

Short silent actuality films documenting the exposition by French director Georges Méliès and by Edison Manufacturing Company producer James H. White, have survived.

<text>In polymer chemistry, ring-opening polymerization (ROP) is a form of chain-growth polymerization in which the terminus of a polymer chain attacks cyclic monomers to form a longer polymer (see figure). The reactive center can be radical, anionic or cationic.

Ring-opening of cyclic monomers is often driven by the relief of bond-angle strain. Thus, as is the case for other types of polymerization, the enthalpy change in ring-opening is negative. Many rings undergo ROP. 

==Monomers==
Many cyclic monomers are amenable to ROP. These include epoxides, cyclic trisiloxanes, some lactones and lactides, cyclic anhydrides, cyclic carbonates, and amino acid &quot;N&quot;-carboxyanhydrides. Many strained cycloalkenes, e.g norbornene, are suitable monomers via ring-opening metathesis polymerization. Even highly strained cycloalkane rings, such as cyclopropane and cyclobutane derivatives, can undergo ROP.

==History==
Ring-opening polymerization has been used since the beginning of the 1900s to produce polymers. Synthesis of polypeptides which has the oldest history of ROP, dates back to the work in 1906 by Leuchs. Subsequently, the ROP of anhydro sugars provided polysaccharides, including synthetic dextran, xanthan gum, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum, and pullulan. Mechanisms and thermodynamics of ring-opening polymerization were established in the 1950s. The first high-molecular weight polymers (Mn up to 105) with a repeating unit were prepared by ROP as early as in 1976.

New research shows that ROP can be completed with cyclic esters with minimal to no use of solvents by using resonant acoustic mixing.

An industrial application is the production of nylon-6 from caprolactam.

==Mechanisms==
Ring-opening polymerization can proceed via radical, anionic, or cationic polymerization as described below. Additionally, radical ROP is useful in producing polymers with functional groups incorporated in the backbone chain that cannot otherwise be synthesized via conventional chain-growth polymerization of vinyl monomers. For instance, radical ROP can produce polymers with ethers, esters, amides, and carbonates as functional groups along the main chain.

===Anionic ring-opening polymerization (AROP)===
Anionic ring-opening polymerizations (AROP) involve nucleophilic reagents as initiators. Monomers with a three-member ring structure - such as epoxides, aziridines, and episulfides - undergo anionic ROP.

A typical example of anionic ROP is that of ε-caprolactone, initiated by an alkoxide.

===Cationic ring-opening polymerization===
Cationic initiators and intermediates characterize cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP). Examples of cyclic monomers that polymerize through this mechanism include lactones, lactams, amines, and ethers. CROP proceeds through an SN1 or SN2 propagation, chain-growth process. The mechanism is affected by the stability of the resulting cationic species. For example, if the atom bearing the positive charge is stabilized by electron-donating groups, polymerization will proceed by the SN1 mechanism. The cationic species is a heteroatom and the chain grows by the addition of cyclic monomers thereby opening the ring system.

The monomers can be activated by Bronsted acids, carbenium ions, onium ions, and metal cations.

CROP can be a living polymerization and can be terminated by nucleophilic reagents such as phenoxy anions, phosphines, or polyanions. When the amount of monomers becomes depleted, termination can occur intra or intermolecularly. The active end can &quot;backbite&quot; the chain, forming a macrocycle. Alkyl chain transfer is also possible, where the active end is quenched by transferring an alkyl chain to another polymer.

===Ring-opening metathesis polymerization===

Ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) produces unsaturated polymers from cycloalkenes or bicycloalkenes. It requires organometallic catalysts.

The mechanism for ROMP follows similar pathways as olefin metathesis. The initiation process involves the coordination of the cycloalkene monomer to the metal alkylidene complex, followed by a [2+2] type cycloaddition to form the metallacyclobutane intermediate that cycloreverts to form a new alkylidene species. 
 Commercially relevant unsaturated polymers synthesized by ROMP include polynorbornene, polycyclooctene, and polycyclopentadiene.

==Thermodynamics==
The formal thermodynamic criterion of a given monomer polymerizability is related to a sign of the free enthalpy (Gibbs free energy) of polymerization:
formula_1
where:
: and indicate monomer and polymer states, respectively ( and/or = l (liquid), g (gaseous), c (amorphous solid), c&#x27; (crystalline solid), s (solution));
: is the enthalpy of polymerization (SI unit: joule per kelvin); 
: is the entropy of polymerization (SI unit: joule);
: is the absolute temperature (SI unit: kelvin).
The free enthalpy of polymerization () may be expressed as a sum of standard enthalpy of polymerization () and a term related to instantaneous monomer molecules and growing macromolecules concentrations: 
formula_2 
where:
: is the gas constant;
: is the monomer;
: is the monomer in an initial state;
: is the active monomer.
Following Flory–Huggins solution theory that the reactivity of an active center, located at a macromolecule of a sufficiently long macromolecular chain, does not depend on its degree of polymerization (), and taking in to account that (where and indicate a standard polymerization enthalpy and entropy, respectively), we obtain: 
:formula_3 
At equilibrium (), when polymerization is complete the monomer concentration () assumes a value determined by standard polymerization parameters ( and ) and polymerization temperature:
formula_4
Polymerization is possible only when . Eventually, at or above the so-called ceiling temperature (), at which , formation of the high polymer does not occur. 
formula_5
For example, tetrahydrofuran (THF) cannot be polymerized above  = 84 °C, nor cyclo-octasulfur (S8) below  = 159 °C. However, for many monomers, and , for polymerization in the bulk, are well above or below the operable polymerization temperatures, respectively.
The polymerization of a majority of monomers is accompanied by an entropy decrease, due mostly to the loss in the translational degrees of freedom. In this situation, polymerization is thermodynamically allowed only when the enthalpic contribution into prevails (thus, when and , the inequality is required). Therefore, the higher the ring strain, the lower the resulting monomer concentration at equilibrium.

<text>Ezri Dax () is a fictional character who appears in the seventh and final season of the American science fiction TV series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Portrayed by Nicole de Boer, she is a counselor aboard the Bajoran space station &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The character is a member of the Trill species, and is formed of both a host and a symbiont—referred to as &quot;Dax&quot;. Ezri was introduced to the series following the death of the previous Dax host, Jadzia (Terry Farrell) at the end of season six. The producers made the decision that the new symbiont bearer would be female in order to ensure that Nana Visitor (as Kira Nerys) was not the only female member of the main cast. There were initial difficulties in casting, and the character changed from one intended to be &quot;spooky&quot; to one struggling to deal with all her previous personalities, having taken on the Dax symbiont without the usual preparation. De Boer was not considered for the part until co-producer Hans Beimler suggested that she submit an audition tape, which resulted in her meeting the producers in Los Angeles and subsequently gaining the role.

The character made her appearance in the first episode of the seventh season, &quot;Image in the Sand&quot;. The character continued to appear throughout the final season of the series, with her final appearance in the series finale, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;. Her character stepped into the void left by Jadzia amongst the crew, but found that she had to redevelop those previous relationships and learn to get along with Jadzia&#x27;s widower, Worf (Michael Dorn). During the course of the season, Ezri becomes less nervous of her role with the crew. She learns from the Dax symbiont and becomes involved romantically with Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig).

The fan reaction to the character was reported as positive, but several of the Ezri-centric episodes came in for criticism, with producer Ira Steven Behr apologising to de Boer for &quot;Prodigal Daughter&quot; – an episode described as &quot;just a mess&quot; by writer Ronald D. Moore. The relationship between Ezri and both Worf and Bashir was described as one of five &quot;great geek TV love triangles&quot;. The inclusion of the character was criticised on the internet, with Ezri being referred to as both an &quot;ill-conceived idea&quot; and a &quot;replacement Dax&quot;.

==Concept and development==
Terry Farrell had portrayed the character of Jadzia Dax from the pilot episode &quot;Emissary&quot; through to &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;, the final episode of season six. The actress had decided not to renew her contract for the seventh season, and so the character was killed off in her final appearance. Due to the character&#x27;s symbiotic nature, only the host died; the symbiont known as Dax survived – which allowed the producers to reintroduce it in a new host later.

Prior to the start of the seventh season, the producers sought to re-introduce Dax with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said &quot;So we started the casting process, and all I saw was a lot of people who couldn&#x27;t play the part. There was absolutely no one in the running.&quot; The initial casting call required an actress with a &quot;spooky&quot; quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should be someone who was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.

Echevarria suggested this to Behr over lunch, but he initially was not sure. By the time they had returned separately to the studio, Behr had an entire plan worked out based on the new premise for the character. Behr suggested that the character should be basically acting as if she has schizophrenia, saying &quot;We&#x27;d never played up the idea in the past, but it made sense. What must it be like to hear all those voices and opinions?&quot; The producers also decided that they wanted a younger actress who felt vulnerable in order to offset the strength that Jadzia had grown into over the years. Casting remained difficult, until Hans Beimler suggested an actress from Canada whom he had once worked with – Nicole de Boer. She had worked with Beimler on the television series &quot;Beyond Reality&quot; and &quot;TekWar&quot;. She was asked to submit an audition tape in which she played out a scene between Ezri and Quark, which she recorded, herself, in her hotel room, and later admitted that she did not know what a Trill was at the time.

At the time, de Boer was busy working in Canada but was unknown as an actress in the United States. She was called to Los Angeles to audition in person based on the strength of the tape, in which she performed a four and a half minute scene written specifically for the audition. It was later converted into a scene used in the episode &quot;Afterimage&quot;. She thought she had ruined her audition when she nearly choked on a glass of water as executive producer Rick Berman entered the room and had to run to the bathroom, by which time she had already soaked her clothes and caused her mascara to run. But Behr praised her, saying &quot;We got a good vibe off her, she knew her part. She got it. And that was it.&quot;

As part of her preparation for each day&#x27;s filming, she had the Trill spots applied by makeup artist Mary Kay Morse, with Michael Westmore working on her detailing instead. This was a change from when Farrell had portrayed Jadzia, as in that case, Westmore had applied the spots himself each day. She made her first appearance in the season seven opener, &quot;Image in the Sand&quot;, for which she was required for only half a day, as she was in only one scene. &quot;I came in and I had one line — that&#x27;s it, I hadn&#x27;t even moved to L.A. yet and I hadn&#x27;t found a place to live.&quot; She began to understand what was required of her from her second episode onwards. She later explained that &quot;I never really got too freaked in the beginning. I thought more of this as the biggest job I&#x27;ve ever had, than going into the whole &quot;Star Trek&quot; phenomenon. I just wanted to do a good job.&quot;

De Boer felt that the producers did a good job with involving Ezri over the course of the seventh season, but not to the extent that it detracted from the more established members of the main cast. However, there was one part of the season when she was concerned that the fans would suffer from &quot;Ezri overload&quot;. But she felt that the character had a real story arc and character evolution as the season went by. She said that she did not want Ezri to remain the same &quot;young and confused&quot; person that she was in her first appearances, which was something that the writers and producers agreed with. She said, &quot;As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person. She became a more complicated character than you might have thought in her first few episodes.&quot; She praised specific episodes that evolved the character, such as &quot;The Siege of AR-558&quot; which required Ezri to draw upon Dax&#x27;s past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed &quot;Prodigal Daughter&quot; as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in &quot;Field of Fire&quot; were &quot;fascinating&quot;. As she approached the end of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, saying that &quot;My first instinct would be to say no. I would need to feel there was a reason for Ezri to be on &quot;Voyager&quot;&quot;. She was interviewed at the series wrap party after completing filming on the final episode, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;, and said, &quot;The last episode was very emotional, especially on the last day... I couldn&#x27;t believe that a season had gone by already. I realized all the people I&#x27;d grown close to must be feeling it much more because they&#x27;d been doing it 7 years. I cried.&quot;

===Background===
Ezri Tigan was born in 2354; she is a member of the indigenous species of the planet Trill. She grew up in the Sappora system with her family, who were shown on the series in the episode &quot;Prodigal Daughter&quot;. She enrolled in Starfleet Academy in 2372 in the medical program, with a specialization in psychology. Two years later, she was assigned as assistant ship&#x27;s counsellor to the USS &quot;Destiny&quot; for field training. During this journey, the ship was assigned to transport the Dax symbiont from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; to Trill, after its host Jadzia (Terry Farrell) was killed by Dukat (Marc Alaimo), but it became necessary for the Dax symbiont to be joined to a new host &quot;en route&quot;.

As Ezri Tigan was the only unjoined Trill on board, she agreed to be joined to the symbiont even though she was unprepared and had not previously sought to be joined. Following the procedure, Ezri—now known as Ezri Dax—spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri&#x27;s romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended; she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host&#x27;s son.

===&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;===
Ezri Dax made her first appearance on the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; series in the premiere episode of season seven, &quot;Image in the Sand&quot;. She had travelled to Earth to find Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), an old friend of both Jadzia and Curzon Dax—two former hosts of the symbiont. She leaves with him, Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton) and Joseph Sisko (Brock Peters), to travel to the planet Tyree to search for the Orb of the Emissary. They find the device; the Captain is hesitant to open it but does, with Ezri&#x27;s encouragement—resulting in the restoration of the Bajoran wormhole. Together they return to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, where Ezri meets the rest of the station&#x27;s crew for the first time.

In the following episode &quot;Afterimage&quot;, Ezri must cope with the reactions of Jadzia&#x27;s former friends to the return of Dax. Worf (Michael Dorn), Jadzia&#x27;s widower, reacts poorly, and Garak (Andrew Robinson) begins to develop the symptoms of acute claustrophobia. Together, Ezri and Garak work through his issues, resulting in her realising that she can remain on the station and Starfleet agreeing to her skipping her final periods of training and receiving a promotion from ensign to lieutenant (junior grade) based on the past experiences of the Dax symbiont. In &quot;The Siege of AR-558&quot;, Ezri is forced to rely on her symbiont&#x27;s past experiences after she and the other members of the &quot;Defiant&quot; crew end up fighting against the Jem&#x27;Hadar on the front lines.

In &quot;Prodigal Daughter&quot;, Ezri returns to her family home on the planet New Sydney, in the Sappora system, after Sisko asks her to investigate the disappearance of Chief Miles O&#x27;Brien (Colm Meaney). There she finds that her family and their pergium mining business are involved with the Orion Syndicate, and discovers that her brother Norvo (Kevin Rahm) murdered the person that O&#x27;Brien was searching for. The Mirror Universe episode &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Cloak&quot; showed an unjoined Ezri Tigan, who is in a relationship with both the alternative Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) and Leeta (Chase Masterson). During the course of the episode, Tigan kills the mirror-Garak, in revenge for the death of Brunt (Jeffrey Combs). The remaining episodes of the season are set in the main universe, with the following episode &quot;Field of Fire&quot; exploring Ezri&#x27;s use of the memories of Joran Dax (Leigh McCloskey)—who had previously been revealed as a murderer in the third season episode &quot;Equilibrium&quot;. She uses those memories to track down a Vulcan serial killer on the station.

Ezri takes a Runabout to the Badlands against Sisko&#x27;s orders in the episode &quot;Penumbra&quot; in order to search for Worf, who has been lost on board a Klingon vessel. She manages to find his escape pod and brings him on board, but the two argue as he resents her presenting herself with the same opinions as Jadzia Dax. However, the two are soon attacked by the Jem&#x27;Hadar and are forced to transport themselves to a nearby planet. The two continue to argue, which results in them having sex. They are captured by the Breen shortly afterwards. The two are subsequently interrogated in &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;, and she reveals to Worf that she is actually in love with Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig). They are subsequently handed over to the Dominion as the Breen/Dominion alliance is announced.

After Worf kills Weyoun (Jeffrey Combs), the pair are scheduled for execution, during which Ezri helps Worf acknowledge that he can&#x27;t idealise Jadzia&#x27;s memory, accepting that he and his wife had different views on intimacy. However, Damar (Casey Biggs), the leader of the Cardassian Union is concerned at what the new alliance might bring and wants to side with the Federation; he releases Ezri and Worf and sets them free to take a message back to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; to seek aid. Worf discusses the actions of the Klingon Chancellor, Gowron (Robert O&#x27;Reilly), with Ezri in &quot;Tacking into the Wind&quot;. Hearing Ezri&#x27;s more pragmatic view on the recent decline of Klingon culture results in Worf confronting the Chancellor and slaying him, ushering in General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) as the new leader of the Klingons as the only man Worf trusts to lead his people honorably. In the series finale, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;, Ezri and Bashir reveal their feelings for one another, and later after the fall of Cardassia Prime and the surrender of the Dominion, they discuss their future together.

===Depiction after the series===
In Pocket Books&#x27; non-canon &quot;DS9&quot; Relaunch novels, Ezri remains on Deep Space Nine but moves from counseling to command, and received a promotion to Lieutenant to become executive officer of the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;. Following a mission on the Trill homeworld, she and Bashir end their romance but decide to remain close friends. In the &quot;Star Trek: Destiny&quot; trilogy, Dax, who had transferred to second officer of the new &quot;Vesta&quot;-class multimission explorer starship USS &quot;Aventine&quot;, received a battlefield promotion to captain and commanding officer. She played a critical role in bringing about the final defeat of the Borg. During the &quot;Star Trek: Typhon Pact&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Fall&quot; series, Dax continues to serve as Captain of the &quot;Aventine&quot;. In the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; novel &quot;Takedown&quot;, the newly promoted Admiral William Riker is stationed aboard the &quot;Aventine&quot; alongside Captain Dax, and the ship is pursued by the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as he is leading a number of renegade starships in attacking Federation targets, later revealed to be the result of Riker being brainwashed by an alien race and choosing the &quot;Aventine&quot; as a subtle means of disrupting their plans by performing his assigned tasks faster than anticipated to give his old shipmates time to deduce his plans and stop them. Ezri is killed in the first part of the &quot;Star Trek: Coda&quot; trilogy, when a temporal disruption leads to the entire multiverse being destabilised, culminating in the &quot;Enterprise&quot; being forced to erase the events of the Novel Verse from existence to preserve the prime reality (as depicted in &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; and related shows).

==Reception and commentary==
The general fan reaction to the character was positive, and the fans appreciated de Boer&#x27;s performances. One negative issue that was raised was that the number of Ezri-centric episodes reduced the number of those available to close up the story arcs involving other characters. The actress had been concerned that the fans did not like her while the production was underway as she was not receiving any fan mail, except for that which she received on her first day of filming. De Boer was not aware that the production team had been holding sacks of mail from the public for her, and she was only able to access it about three quarters of the way through the season. Ezri was referred to as &quot;Ally McTrill&quot; by &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine — a reference to the title character on the television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; — which de Boer took as a compliment.

The differences between Ezri and Jadzia were often considered by viewers and critics. In &quot;Where No Woman Has Gone Before: Feminist Perspectives On Star Trek&quot;, an essay by Susan A. Lentz within the book &quot;Star Trek Visions of Law and Justice&quot;, Ezri was described as &quot;less assured, insecure, and uncertain who she is. Of course, Jadzia may have herself once been such a host. The growth and evolution of Ezri unfold as she acknowledges her &#x27;past lives&#x27;.&quot; Ezri&#x27;s relationships with Bashir and Worf were also regarded as an extension of Jadzia&#x27;s previous relationships, leading to it being listed as one of the 5 &quot;great geek TV love triangles&quot; by the website Den of Geek. However, this romantic plot featuring Ezri and Worf/Bashir was criticised by website DVD Talk in their review of the season seven DVD release saying that it was similar to a &quot;soap opera&quot;.

Criticism was directed at some of the character&#x27;s aspects, and toward the introduction of the character. Jim Johnson-Smith, in &quot;American Science Fiction TV&quot;, uses an example of Ezri and Worf&#x27;s concentration on their romantic relationship in the episode &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot; instead of being more concerned with their capture by the Breen. Ezri was described as &quot;an ill-conceived idea that never really took off and has left many DS9 fans angry that a show favourite (Jadzia Dax) isn&#x27;t around any more&quot; by the website Flickering Myth. The review on DVD Talk also stated &quot;With its large ensemble cast, DS9 could have gone on perfectly well without a replacement for Jadzia. Instead, we get a &quot;replacement Dax&quot; who turns out to be, hands down, the least interesting and most annoying character DS9 has been stuck with.&quot;

In addition, as de Boer feared, the Ezri-centric episodes came in for criticism. DVD Talk described &quot;Prodigal Daughter&quot; as &quot;clearly an attempt to cram some back-story into Ezri to make up for the fact that she&#x27;s a new character&quot;, and &quot;Field of Fire&quot; as &quot;utterly generic&quot;. The former was also considered to be the weakest of the season by the crew on the series, with Behr apologising to de Boer for it afterwards. Writer Ronald D. Moore simply stated, &quot;It was just a mess.&quot; The crew nicknamed it &quot;Audra Goes Home&quot;, a reference to the 1960s western television show &quot;The Big Valley&quot;.
In 2016, Ezri was ranked as the 32nd most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by Wired magazine, out of 100 characters.

===Mirror version===
The mirror version of Ezri, as seen in the episode &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Cloak&quot;, was not joined to the Dax symbiont, and was both a mercenary and a lesbian. Previously when &quot;Star Trek&quot; had dealt with issues relating to homosexuality, it had received complaints from the fanbase. This had occurred during the fifth season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in the episode &quot;The Outcast&quot; where Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) has a romantic liaison with a female member of an alien race that is typically non-gendered and whose society views identifying with a gender as deviant behavior.

Criticism was received once again when Jadzia Dax had a same-sex kiss in the episode &quot;Rejoined&quot;. Because of real world changes, such as further acceptance of same-sex couples and an increased number of homosexual characters on television, the negative response to the lesbian version of Ezri was not as heavy as those earlier story-lines.

<text>Europa Universalis is a grand strategy video game developed by Paradox Development Studio and published in 2000 by Strategy First.

==Development==
The game was originally based on a French board game of the same name by Philippe Thibaut that was released in 1993. To facilitate the new game, a new proprietary software engine, known as the Europa Engine, was developed. The game went gold on January 23, 2001.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Europa Universalis&quot; is a historically accurate real-time strategy game; it recreates 300 years of history from the Age of Discovery in 1492 to Napoleon&#x27;s rise to power in 1792. 

The game lets the player take control of one of seven European nations (others are available in different scenarios) from 1492 to 1792, expanding its power through military might, diplomacy, and colonial wealth. The game takes place on a two-dimensional map divided into approximately 1,500 provinces, and proceeds in a pausable real time format. Part of the presented world is invisible for the player (terra incognita) – it is however possible to explore individual provinces.

The player directs one of the eight European powers available in the scenario and represents the individual historical rulers. They change over time according to historical realities and have different skills that translate into the development of the country. For example, John III Sobieski has high military skills in the game and Suleiman the Magnificent is a character with high administrative skills. The game features a number of historical events, such as the Reformation, the Treaty of Tordesillas and the uprising in the Netherlands, which have a significant impact on the game.

The player can take care of technological development in their own country by allocating part of the budget to research. Technological progress is linear and consists in reaching higher and higher levels of technology in four areas: army, navy, infrastructure and trade. With progressive development, the player gains new capabilities, such as improved units. It is also possible to increase spending to maintain stability in the state or to abandon all subsidies to increase the state treasury at the expense of rising inflation.

Rebellions of the population can be a problem for internal development. Rebellions occur when there are differences between the state religion and the religion followed in a province (there are several different faiths and religions in the game), taxation of the population through the establishment of a tax collector&#x27;s office, or as a result of game-activated events. Rebels can even secede from the state and declare independence. Therefore, the stability system plays an important role in the game, which determines the risk of rebellion in the provinces, as well as the speed of city development and the amount of taxes collected.

A special element of the game is the colonisation of uninhabited territories. The player, using conquistadors (in the case of land forces) and explorers (for sea forces) has the possibility to discover new provinces and thanks to the settlers can settle the chosen territory.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. John Lee of &quot;NextGen&quot; said, &quot;A full-bodied simulation of European turmoil and global expansion between the 15th and 18th centuries, &quot;Europa Universalis&quot; isn&#x27;t all that original, but if historic realism is your passion, you&#x27;ll like what you see.&quot; &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; gave the game acclaim while it was still in development in Europe.

The staff of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; nominated the game for &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; at the 11th Annual Computer Games Awards, which went to &quot;Civilization III&quot;.

==Sequels==
&quot;Europa Universalis&quot; was the first in the series, followed by &quot;Europa Universalis II&quot;, &quot;Europa Universalis III&quot;, &quot;Europa Universalis: Rome&quot; and &quot;Europa Universalis IV&quot;.

<doc id="308882" wikidata="Q550239" url="?curid=308882" title="Australian Recording Industry Association">
<text>The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) is a trade association representing the Australian recording industry which was established in the 1970s by six major record companies, EMI, Festival, CBS, RCA, WEA and Universal replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956. It oversees the collection, administration and distribution of music licences and royalties.

The association has more than 190 members, including small labels typically run by one to five people, medium size organisations and very large companies with international affiliates. ARIA is administered by a board of directors comprising senior executives from record companies, both large and small.

==History==
In 1956, the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) was formed by Australia&#x27;s major record companies. It was replaced in the 1970s by the Australian Recording Industry Association, which was established by the six major record companies operating in Australia, EMI (now part of Universal Music Group), Festival Records, CBS (now known as Sony Music), RCA (now part of Sony Music), WEA (now known as Warner Music Group) and Polygram (now known as Universal). It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members. By 1997, the six major labels provided 90% of all recordings made in Australia. ARIA is administered by a board of directors comprising senior executives from record companies, both large and small.

==ARIA charts==

The ARIA Charts is the main Australian music sales charts, issued weekly by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The charts are a record of the highest selling singles and albums in various genres. All charts are compiled from data of both physical and digital sales from retailers in Australia.

The first printed national top 50 chart available in record stores, branded the &quot;Countdown&quot; chart, was dated the week ending 10 July 1983.

ARIA began compiling its own charts in-house from the chart survey dated 13 June 1988, corresponding with the printed top 50 chart dated the week ending 26 June 1988, at which time it became the official Australian chart.

==ARIA certifications==
===Current accreditation levels===
A music single or album qualifies for a platinum certification if it exceeds 70,000 copies shipped to retailers and a gold certification for 35,000 copies shipped. The diamond certification was created in November 2015 to mark 500,000 sales/shipments. The diamond award includes an aggregation of sales of albums plus the sales of the tracks from that album after 1 July 
2014, where 10 track sales equal one album. A silver certification for albums was introduced in November 2024. The silver award applies only to albums by Australian artists, released no earlier than 2021 and the required level of 20,000 units must be achieved within three years of the album&#x27;s release.

For music DVDs (formerly videos), a gold accreditation originally represented 7,500 copies shipped, with a platinum accreditation representing 15,000 units shipped.

===Former accreditation levels===
On 1 January 1977, the Australian Record Industry Association announced major revisions in its accreditation awards system. No longer were awards based on dollar terms but rather unit sales. Gold records will be awarded to singles selling 50,000 units, EPs selling 30,000 units and albums selling 20,000 units.

At the same time, the industry introduced a platinum award in recognition of the growth achievement of the Australian market. Platinum awards were issued to singles selling 100,000 and albums selling 50,000 units.
Prior to 1977, awards were based on dollar value rather than unit sales and only issued gold awards.
==ARIA Awards==
===ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards===
The ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards were established in 2002 to recognise Australian recording artists, who reached number one on the ARIA albums, singles and music DVDs charts. A similar Australian Chart #1 Awards was established in August 2024, awarded to artists topping the Australian Albums Chart and Australian Singles Chart.

===ARIA Music Awards===

The ARIA Music Awards is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the Australian music industry. The event has been held annually since 1987; it encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards known as the ARIA Awards, as well as the Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Lifetime Achievement Awards and the ARIA Hall of Fame (held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011).

Australian TV pop music show &quot;Countdown&quot; presented its own annual awards ceremony, &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards, which was co-produced by Carolyn James (also known as Carolyn Bailey) during 1981–1984 in collaboration with ARIA. ARIA provided peer voting for some awards, while &quot;Countdown&quot; provided coupons in the related &quot;Countdown Magazine&quot; for viewers to vote for populist awards. At the 1985 &quot;Countdown&quot; awards ceremony, held on 14 April 1986, fans of INXS and Uncanny X-Men scuffled during the broadcast and as a result ARIA decided to hold their own awards.

Since 2 March 1987, ARIA administered its own entirely peer-voted ARIA Music Awards, to &quot;recognise excellence and innovation in all genres of Australian music&quot; with an annual ceremony. Initially included in the same awards ceremonies, it established the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1988 and has held separate annual ceremonies since 2005. The ARIA Hall of Fame &quot;honours Australian musicians&#x27; achievements [that] have had a significant impact in Australia or around the world&quot;.

==Criticisms==
Like most recording industry associations, ARIA has been criticised for fighting copyright infringement matters aggressively, although in Australia this has largely taken the form of aggressive advertising campaigns particularly in cinemas directly preceding movies. This criticism is stauncher in Australia due to the absence of an equivalent Digital Millennium Copyright Act or state crimes acts which clearly establish copyright infringement as a crime.
In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) took legal action against Kazaa, alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two Sharman Networks executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.

ARIA has been criticised by former &quot;Australian Idol&quot; judge and record producer Ian Dickson for a perceived intolerance of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; contestants, and a lack of nomination in the ARIA Awards.

<text>In chemistry, the dispersity is a measure of the heterogeneity of sizes of molecules or particles in a mixture. A collection of objects is called uniform if the objects have the same size, shape, or mass. A sample of objects that have an inconsistent size, shape and mass distribution is called non-uniform. The objects can be in any form of chemical dispersion, such as particles in a colloid, droplets in a cloud, crystals in a rock,
or polymer macromolecules in a solution or a solid polymer mass. Polymers can be described by molecular mass distribution; a population of particles can be described by size, surface area, and/or mass distribution; and thin films can be described by film thickness distribution.

IUPAC has deprecated the use of the term polydispersity index, having replaced it with the term &quot;dispersity&quot;, represented by the symbol Đ (pronounced D-stroke) which can refer to either molecular mass or degree of polymerization. It can be calculated using the equation &quot;Đ&quot;M = &quot;M&quot;w/&quot;M&quot;n, where &quot;M&quot;w is the weight-average molar mass and &quot;M&quot;n is the number-average molar mass. It can also be calculated according to degree of polymerization, where &quot;Đ&quot;X = &quot;X&quot;w/&quot;X&quot;n, where &quot;X&quot;w is the weight-average degree of polymerization and &quot;X&quot;n is the number-average degree of polymerization. In certain limiting cases where &quot;Đ&quot;M = &quot;Đ&quot;X, it is simply referred to as &quot;Đ&quot;. IUPAC has also deprecated the terms &quot;monodisperse&quot;, which is considered to be self-contradictory, and &quot;polydisperse&quot;, which is considered redundant, preferring the terms &quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;non-uniform&quot; instead. The terms monodisperse and polydisperse are however still preferentially used to describe particles in an aerosol.

==Overview==
A uniform polymer (often referred to as a monodisperse polymer) is composed of molecules of the same mass. Nearly all natural polymers are uniform. Synthetic near-uniform polymer chains can be made by processes such as anionic polymerization, a method using an anionic catalyst to produce chains that are similar in length. This technique is also known as living polymerization. It is used commercially for the production of block copolymers. Uniform collections can be easily created through the use of template-based synthesis, a common method of synthesis in nanotechnology.

A polymer material is denoted by the term disperse, or non-uniform, if its chain lengths vary over a wide range of molecular masses. This is characteristic of man-made polymers. Natural organic matter produced by the decomposition of plants and wood debris in soils (humic substances) also has a pronounced polydispersed character. It is the case of humic acids and fulvic acids, natural polyelectrolyte substances having respectively higher and lower molecular weights. Another interpretation of dispersity is explained in the article Dynamic light scattering (cumulant method subheading). In this sense, the dispersity values are in the range from 0 to 1.

The dispersity (Đ), also known as the polydispersity index (PDI) or heterogeneity index, is a measure of the distribution of molecular mass in a given polymer sample. &quot;Đ&quot; (PDI) of a polymer is calculated:

:formula_1,

where formula_2 is the weight average molecular weight and formula_3 is the number average molecular weight. formula_3 is more sensitive to molecules of low molecular mass, while formula_2 is more sensitive to molecules of high molecular mass. The dispersity indicates the distribution of individual molecular masses in a batch of polymers. &quot;Đ&quot; has a value equal to or greater than 1, but as the polymer chains approach uniform chain length, &quot;Đ&quot; approaches unity (1). For some natural polymers &quot;Đ&quot; is almost taken as unity.

==Effect of polymerization mechanism==
Typical dispersities vary based on the mechanism of polymerization and can be affected by a variety of reaction conditions. In synthetic polymers, it can vary greatly due to reactant ratio, how close the polymerization went to completion, etc. For typical addition polymerization, &quot;Đ&quot; can range around 5 to 20. For typical step polymerization, most probable values of &quot;Đ&quot; are around 2 —Carothers&#x27; equation limits Đ to values of 2 and below.

Living polymerization, a special case of addition polymerization, leads to values very close to 1. Such is the case also in biological polymers, where the dispersity can be very close or equal to 1, indicating only one length of polymer is present.

==Effect of reactor type==
The reactor polymerization reactions take place in can also affect the dispersity of the resulting polymer. For bulk radical polymerization with low (&lt;10%) conversion, anionic polymerization, and step growth polymerization to high conversion (&gt;99%), typical dispersities are in the table below.

With respect to batch and plug flow reactors (PFRs), the dispersities for the different polymerization methods are the same. This is largely because while batch reactors depend entirely on time of reaction, plug flow reactors depend on distance traveled in the reactor and its length. Since time and distance are related by velocity, plug flow reactors can be designed to mirror batch reactors by controlling the velocity and length of the reactor. Continuously stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) however have a residence time distribution and cannot mirror batch or plug flow reactors, which can cause a difference in the dispersity of final polymer.

The effects of reactor type on dispersity depend largely on the relative timescales associated with the reactor, and with the polymerization type. In conventional bulk free radical polymerization, the dispersity is often controlled by the proportion of chains that terminate via combination or disproportionation. The rate of reaction for free radical polymerization is exceedingly quick, due to the reactivity of the radical intermediates. When these radicals react in any reactor, their lifetimes, and as a result, the time needed for reaction are much shorter than any reactor residence time. For FRPs that have a constant monomer and initiator concentration, such that the DPn is constant, the dispersity of the resulting monomer is between 1.5 and 2.0. As a result, reactor type does not affect dispersity for free radical polymerization reactions in any noticeable amount as long as conversion is low.

For anionic polymerization, a form of living polymerization, the reactive anion intermediates have the ability to remain reactive for a very long time. In batch reactors or PFRs, well-controlled anionic polymerization can result in almost uniform polymer. When introduced into a CSTR however, the residence time distribution for reactants in the CSTR affects the dispersity of the anionic polymer due to the anion lifetime. For a homogeneous CSTR, the residence time distribution is the most probable distribution. Since the anionic polymerization dispersity for a batch reactor or PFR is basically uniform, the molecular weight distribution takes on the distribution of the CSTR residence times, resulting in a dispersity of 2. Heterogeneous CSTRs are similar to homogeneous CSTRs, but the mixing within the reactor is not as good as in a homogeneous CSTR. As a result, there are small sections within the reactor that act as smaller batch reactors within the CSTR and end up with different concentrations of reactants. As a result, the dispersity of the reactor lies between that of a batch and that of a homogeneous CSTR.

Step growth polymerization is most affected by reactor type. To achieve any high molecular weight polymer, the fractional conversion must exceed 0.99, and the dispersity of this reaction mechanism in a batch or PFR is 2.0. Running a step-growth polymerization in a CSTR will allow some polymer chains out of the reactor before achieving high molecular weight, while others stay in the reactor for a long time and continue to react. The result is a much more broad molecular weight distribution, which leads to much larger dispersities. For a homogeneous CSTR, the dispersity is proportional to the square root of the Damköhler number, but for a heterogeneous CSTR, dispersity is proportional to the natural log of the Damköhler number. Thus, for the similar reasons as anionic polymerization, the dispersity for heterogeneous CSTRs lies between that of a batch and a homogeneous CSTR.

==Determination methods==
* Gel permeation chromatography (also known as size-exclusion chromatography)
* Light scattering measurements such as dynamic light scattering
* Direct measurement via mass spectrometry, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) or electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS)

<text>In the theory of computation, a tag system is a deterministic model of computation published by Emil Leon Post in 1943 as a simple form of a Post canonical system. A tag system may also be viewed as an abstract machine, called a Post tag machine (not to be confused with Post–Turing machines)—briefly, a finite-state machine whose only tape is a FIFO queue of unbounded length, such that in each transition the machine reads the symbol at the head of the queue, deletes a constant number of symbols from the head, and appends to the tail a symbol-string that depends solely on the first symbol read in this transition.

Because all of the indicated operations are performed in a single transition, a tag machine strictly has only one state.

== Definitions ==

A &quot;tag system&quot; is a triplet (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;P&quot;), where

* &quot;m&quot; is a positive integer, called the &quot;deletion number&quot;.
* &quot;A&quot; is a finite alphabet of symbols, one of which can be a special &quot;halting symbol&quot;. All finite (possibly empty) strings on &quot;A&quot; are called &quot;words&quot;.
* &quot;P&quot; is a set of &quot;production rules&quot;, assigning a word &quot;P(x)&quot; (called a &quot;production&quot;) to each symbol &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. The production (say &quot;P()&quot;) assigned to the halting symbol is seen below to play no role in computations, but for convenience is taken to be &quot;P()&quot; = &quot;&quot;.

A &quot;halting word&quot; is a word that either begins with the halting symbol or whose length is less than &quot;m&quot;.

A transformation &quot;t&quot; (called the &quot;tag operation&quot;) is defined on the set of non-halting words, such that if &quot;x&quot; denotes the leftmost symbol of a word &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;t&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is the result of deleting the leftmost &quot;m&quot; symbols of &quot;S&quot; and appending the word &quot;P(x)&quot; on the right. Thus, the system processes the m-symbol head into a tail of variable length, but the generated tail depends solely on the first symbol of the head.

A &quot;computation&quot; by a tag system is a finite sequence of words produced by iterating the transformation &quot;t&quot;, starting with an initially given word and halting when a halting word is produced. (By this definition, a computation is not considered to exist unless a halting word is produced in finitely-many iterations. Alternative definitions allow nonhalting computations, for example by using a special subset of the alphabet to identify words that encode output.)

The term &quot;m-tag system&quot; is often used to emphasise the deletion number. Definitions vary somewhat in the literature (cf. References), the one presented here being that of Rogozhin.

The use of a halting symbol in the above definition allows the output of a computation to be encoded in the final word alone, whereas otherwise the output would be encoded in the entire sequence of words produced by iterating the tag operation.

A common alternative definition uses no halting symbol and treats all words of length less than &quot;m&quot; as halting words. Another definition is the original one used by (described in the historical note below), in which the only halting word is the empty string.

=== Example: A simple 2-tag illustration ===

This is merely to illustrate a simple 2-tag system that uses a halting symbol.

=== Example: Computation of Collatz sequences ===

This simple 2-tag system is adapted from . It uses no halting symbol, but halts on any word of length less than 2, and computes a slightly modified version of the Collatz sequence.

In the original Collatz sequence, the successor of &quot;n&quot; is either (for even &quot;n&quot;) or 3&quot;n&quot; + 1 (for odd n). The value 3&quot;n&quot; + 1 is clearly even for odd &quot;n&quot;, hence the next term after 3&quot;n&quot; + 1 is surely . In the sequence computed by the tag system below we skip this intermediate step, hence the successor of &quot;n&quot; is for odd &quot;n&quot;.

In this tag system, a positive integer &quot;n&quot; is represented by the word aa...a with &quot;n&quot; a&#x27;s.

== Turing-completeness of &quot;m&quot;-tag systems ==

For each &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1, the set of &quot;m&quot;-tag systems is Turing-complete; i.e., for each &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1, it is the case that for any given Turing machine T, there is an &quot;m&quot;-tag system that emulates T. In particular, a 2-tag system can be constructed to emulate a Universal Turing machine, as was done by and by .

Conversely, a Turing machine can be shown to be a Universal Turing Machine by proving that it can emulate a Turing-complete class of &quot;m&quot;-tag systems. For example, proved the universality of the class of 2-tag systems with alphabet {&quot;a1&quot;, ..., &quot;an&quot;, } and corresponding productions {&quot;ananW1&quot;, ..., &quot;ananWn-1&quot;, &quot;anan&quot;, }, where the &quot;Wk&quot; are nonempty words; he then proved the universality of a very small (4-state, 6-symbol) Turing machine by showing that it can simulate this class of tag systems.

The 2-tag system is an efficient simulator of universal Turing machines, in formula_1 time. That is, if formula_2 is a deterministic single-tape Turing machine that runs in time formula_3, then there is a 2-tag system that simulates it in formula_1 time.

== The 2-tag halting problem ==
This version of the halting problem is among the simplest, most-easily described undecidable decision problems:

Given an arbitrary positive integer &quot;n&quot; and a list of &quot;n&quot;+1 arbitrary words &quot;P&quot;1,&quot;P&quot;2...,&quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;Q&quot; on the alphabet {1,2...,&quot;n&quot;}, does repeated application of the tag operation &quot;t&quot;: &quot;ijX&quot; → &quot;XP&quot;&quot;i&quot; eventually convert &quot;Q&quot; into a word of length less than 2? That is, does the sequence &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;t&quot;1(&quot;Q&quot;), &quot;t&quot;2(&quot;Q&quot;), &quot;t&quot;3(&quot;Q&quot;), ... terminate?

== Historical note on the definition of tag system ==

The above definition differs from that of , whose tag systems use no halting symbol, but rather halt only on the empty word, with the tag operation &quot;t&quot; being defined as follows:

* If &quot;x&quot; denotes the leftmost symbol of a nonempty word &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;t&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is the operation consisting of first appending the word &quot;P(x)&quot; to the right end of &quot;S&quot;, and then deleting the leftmost &quot;m&quot; symbols of the result — deleting all if there be less than &quot;m&quot; symbols.

The above remark concerning the Turing-completeness of the set of &quot;m&quot;-tag systems, for any &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1, applies also to these tag systems as originally defined by Post.

=== Origin of the name &quot;tag&quot; ===

According to a footnote in , B. P. Gill suggested the name for an earlier variant of the problem in which the first &quot;m&quot; symbols are left untouched, but rather a check mark indicating the current position moves to the right by &quot;m&quot; symbols every step. The name for the problem of determining whether or not the check mark ever touches the end of the sequence was then dubbed the &quot;problem of tag&quot;, referring to the children&#x27;s game of tag.

==Cyclic tag systems==

A cyclic tag system is a modification of the original tag system. The alphabet consists of only two symbols, 0 and 1, and the production rules comprise a list of productions considered sequentially, cycling back to the beginning of the list after considering the &quot;last&quot; production on the list. For each production, the leftmost symbol of the word is examined—if the symbol is 1, the current production is appended to the right end of the word; if the symbol is 0, no characters are appended to the word; in either case, the leftmost symbol is then deleted. The system halts if and when the word becomes empty.

===Example===
Cyclic tag systems were created by Matthew Cook and were used in Cook&#x27;s demonstration that the Rule 110 cellular automaton is universal. A key part of the demonstration was that cyclic tag systems can emulate a Turing-complete class of tag systems.

==Emulation of tag systems by cyclic tag systems==

An &quot;m&quot;-tag system with alphabet {&quot;a1&quot;, ..., &quot;an&quot;} and corresponding productions {&quot;P1&quot;, ..., &quot;Pn&quot;} is emulated by a cyclic tag system with &quot;m*n&quot; productions (&quot;Q1&quot;, ..., &quot;Qn&quot;, -, -, ..., -), where all but the first &quot;n&quot; productions are the empty string (denoted by &quot;). The &quot;Qk&quot; are encodings of the respective &quot;Pk&quot;, obtained by replacing each symbol of the tag system alphabet by a length-&quot;n&quot; binary string as follows (these are to be applied also to the initial word of a tag system computation):

 &quot;a1&quot; = 100...00
 &quot;a2&quot; = 010...00
 .
 &quot;an&quot; = 000...01

That is, &quot;ak&quot; is encoded as a binary string with a in the kth position from the left, and &#x27;s elsewhere. Successive lines of a tag system computation will then occur encoded as every (&quot;m*n&quot;)th line of its emulation by the cyclic tag system.

===Example===

This is a very small example to illustrate the emulation technique.
Every sixth line (marked by &quot;) produced by the cyclic tag system is the encoding of a corresponding line of the tag system computation, until the emulated halt is reached.

Until September 2020, he was also the only athlete to throw more than 95 metres with the new type of javelin, something he achieved three times.

During his career, Železný had many great battles against the likes of Steve Backley, Sergey Makarov, Boris Henry, Seppo Räty, Raymond Hecht and Aki Parviainen.

Železný planned to retire after the 2006 European Championships in Gothenburg, where he won the bronze medal with a throw of .
He took leave of his career on 19 September 2006 on exhibition in Mladá Boleslav, the place where he started with athletics.

Four days after winning a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, Železný had a tryout as a baseball pitcher with the Atlanta Braves at Fulton County Stadium. Both Železný and the Braves treated the tryout seriously and not as a &quot;publicity stunt&quot; or &quot;sideshow&quot;, though Železný had no baseball experience beyond throwing a ball at home with his young son.

<text>A Fish Called Wanda is a 1988 heist comedy film directed by Charles Crichton and written by Crichton and John Cleese. It stars Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, and Michael Palin. The film follows a gang of diamond thieves who double-cross one another to recover stolen diamonds hidden by their jailed leader. His barrister becomes a central figure – and jealousies rage – as &quot;femme fatale&quot; Wanda seduces him to locate the loot.

The picture grossed over $188 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 1988. It received three nominations at the 61st Academy Awards: Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Kline, which he would go on to win. A spiritual sequel, &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;, was released in 1997. The British Film Institute ranked &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; the 39th-greatest British film of the 20th century.

==Plot==
London-based gangster George Thomason plans a jewel heist with his right-hand man, Ken Pile, an animal lover with a stutter. They bring in two Americans: con artist Wanda Gershwitz and weapons expert Otto West, a volatile anglophobe. Wanda and Otto are lovers, but pretend to be siblings so Wanda can work her charms on Ken and George. The heist succeeds and the gang escapes with a large sum in diamonds, which they hide. Wanda and Otto then betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the loot, with Wanda planning to double-cross Otto as well, but it is gone: suspecting duplicity, George had moved it to a safe deposit box and given Ken the key. Wanda sees Ken hide it in his fish tank, steals it, and conceals it in her locket.

To learn where the box is, Wanda decides to seduce George&#x27;s barrister, Archie Leach. He is in a loveless marriage and quickly falls for her, but Otto&#x27;s jealous interference causes their liaisons to go disastrously wrong. When Wanda accidentally leaves her locket at Archie&#x27;s house his wife, Wendy, finds it and delightedly assumes it was a gift for her. Wanda demands that Archie retrieve her keepsake, but Wendy will not give it up. He then fakes a robbery at his home as a cover for its disappearance. It too is interrupted and foiled by Otto. Archie is later able to retrieve the locket, and returns it to Wanda at their next tryst, this time unraveled by innocent intruders. Realizing he will be unable to give her all she seeks, he subsequently telephones her to call off their affair. Otto arrives at Archie&#x27;s house seeking to apologize for his rudeness, but Wendy overhears their conversation and learns of Archie&#x27;s liaison.

George asks Ken to eliminate the Crown&#x27;s only eyewitness to the robbery, the elderly Eileen Coady. Ken repeatedly tries, but each time accidentally kills one of her three small dogs instead, causing him great distress. Finally, the last grisly death gives Mrs Coady a fatal heart attack. With no witness, George seems poised to be released. He gives instructions to Ken, revealing the location of the diamonds. When Otto learns that Ken knows this, he tortures him into revealing it by tying him up and putting various items of food up his nostrils and in his mouth before eating all of his pet tropical fish one by one, leaving Ken&#x27;s favorite, named Wanda, until last. Ken divulges that the diamonds are at the Cathcart Towers Hotel near Heathrow Airport, but does not know that Wanda has the key. 

Even with Otto&#x27;s knowledge and Wanda&#x27;s key, the two still need George to remain in prison. Testifying as a defense witness at his trial, Wanda unexpectedly gives evidence incriminating him. Archie is stunned by her statements and flubs his questioning, inadvertently calling her &quot;darling&quot;. Wendy, watching from the public gallery, declares their marriage dead. Promising less prison time, Archie asks George about the diamonds and learns of Otto and Wanda&#x27;s complicity and that Ken knows their location. Archie sees Wanda fleeing the court and shunts her into his car. With his career and marriage ruined, Archie resolves to cut his losses, throw in with her, steal the loot, and flee to South America together. 

They race to Ken&#x27;s flat. While Archie interrogates him, Otto steals Archie&#x27;s car, with Wanda in it. Archie painstakingly draws out from an uncontrollably stuttering Ken that the safe deposit box is at an airport hotel. They then set out for Heathrow on Ken&#x27;s moped. Otto and Wanda recover the diamonds, but Wanda double-crosses him and saps him unconscious in a Heathrow broom cupboard. She reluctantly boards her flight to Rio de Janeiro without Archie. Otto recovers, steals a boarding pass, and makes his way to the tarmac, where he is confronted by Archie. Otto is about to kill him, but is stalled while Ken approaches on a steamroller, seeking vengeance for his fish. Otto finds he has stepped in wet concrete and cannot move. Ken runs him over. Archie joins Wanda aboard the plane. Improbably, Otto again appears seeking to derail things between them. Covered in encrusted concrete, he clings outside their window until he is blown off during take-off. An epilogue relates that Archie and Wanda were married in Rio, had seventeen children, and founded a leper colony; Ken, having lost his stutter upon getting revenge on Otto, became Master of Ceremonies at SeaWorld; and Otto became the Minister of Justice for South Africa.

==Production==
Cleese and Crichton had attempted to make a film together in 1969. Although the project never entered development, they promised each other that they would collaborate again. In June 1983, the two began writing the script for &quot;Wanda&quot;, and, for the next two and half years, they met three times a month to work on the script. According to Crichton, &quot;We had a week of rehearsals and then a gap of two weeks in which to incorporate any new ideas which had been thrown up and to polish the script.&quot; According to Michael Palin, the original title was &quot;A Goldfish Called Wanda&quot;.

Cleese told an interviewer that he called his character Archie Leach, actor Cary Grant&#x27;s real name, because &quot;I feel this film is as near as I&#x27;ll ever get to being Cary Grant.&quot; Cleese, admitting in press interviews that he had no knowledge of how to direct a film, served as co-director, since the studio executives at MGM were worried about Crichton&#x27;s age—he was 78 at the time. On the set, Crichton wore a T-shirt presented to him by Cleese and inscribed &quot;Age and treachery will always overcome youth and skill&quot;. Cleese cast his real life daughter Cynthia as his screen daughter Portia in the film. Filming began in England on July 13, 1987, and wrapped on September 21, 1987 after 70 days.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film premiered in New York City on July 7, 1988, and in Los Angeles on July 13, 1988, and was released theatrically on July 15, 1988, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Six weeks later, it reached number one at the box office there. It eventually grossed $62.5 million in the United States and Canada, became the highest-grossing British film of all time with a gross of £12 million. Outside of the US (including the UK), it grossed $126.1 million, for a worldwide total of $188.6 million. It was the number one rental video in the US in 1989.

===Recognition===
Kline won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance. Cleese and Crichton received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Crichton was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, Cleese won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Curtis received nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. Michael Palin won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, while Maria Aitken received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

===Rankings===
In 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; 35th on their list of the 100 best British films, with their entry calling it &quot;a must-own for any British comedy fan&quot;, adding, &quot;it made possible Richard Curtis&#x27;s later Brit-com oeuvre by establishing that British eccentricism can sell, revived the world&#x27;s interest in Ealing comedies, and allowed a character with Cary Grant&#x27;s real name – Cleese&#x27;s bumbling lawyer Archie Leach – to live again on the big screen.&quot; The film is number 27 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. It is also included in the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; &quot;100 Funniest Films&quot; list.

In 1999, it was voted 39th on the BFI Top 100 British films list compiled by the British Film Institute. Also in 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list, where it was ranked number 21. Then in 2003, AFI nominated Otto West as a villain from this film for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains. James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; awarded the film four out of four stars in his review; it is also number 10 on his &quot;Top 100&quot; list.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating, based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Smartly written, smoothly directed, and solidly cast, &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; offers a classic example of a brainy comedy with widespread appeal.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 80 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. According to CriticsTop10, &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; appeared on over 60 critics&#x27; top ten lists, making it the fifth most acclaimed film of 1988. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale as of July 2020.

=== Portrayal of stuttering ===
In March of 1989, a few months after the release of the film, the Orange County chapter of the National Stuttering Project (the predecessor of the National Stuttering Association) picketed outside MGM offices in Culver City in protest of the movie.

===Accolades===
===Laughing death===
During the initial run of the film, a Danish audiologist named Ole Bentzen died while laughing during a screening, which led newspapers to report that he had died from laughter. The official cause of death was heart fibrillation, which may have been caused by an increased heart rate due to extended laughter. Cleese considered using the event for publicity, but ultimately decided that doing so would be in bad taste.

==Sequels and adaptations==
The principal cast reunited in 1997 for &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; (dubbed an &quot;equal&quot; rather than a sequel or prequel, by Kline), playing different roles. &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; was not as well received by critics or audiences as &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;. The novelization of &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;, written by Iain Johnstone, who co-wrote the film, begins with a letter from Archie (John Cleese&#x27;s character in the first film) to his brother Rollo. According to the letter:
*Archie and Wanda are still living happily in Rio, and Wanda enjoys having a new child (or multiple children) each year;
*Otto visited them once, having left South Africa after Nelson Mandela&#x27;s election and the end of the apartheid regime; he is looking for like-minded individuals to form a similar group of National Socialists, and Archie and Wanda are both heartily glad when he is gone;
*Ken is still master of ceremonies at the London Sea World; before visiting Rio, Otto &quot;looked him up&quot; as if they were old friends, apparently showed up with a bag of tropical fish as a peace offering but did not even get close before Ken had security guards throw Otto out of the park. Otto as an act of final revenge empties the bag of fish into his mouth and swallows with no remorse. 

In 2008, it was reported that Cleese and his daughter, Cynthia (who played his screen daughter, Portia), had started to work on a stage musical version of the film.

===Indian adaptations===
*Malayalam film &quot;Kakkakuyil&quot; (2002) was inspired from this film with many changes. 
**Telugu film &quot;Tappu Chesi Pappu Koodu&quot; (2002) was a remake of Kakkakuyil.
**Tamil film &quot;London&quot; (2005) was also a remake of Kakkakuyil.
*Hindi film &quot;Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav&quot; (2005), was a loose adaptation of this film.

<text>[[Sierra Leone]] maintains formal relations with many Western nations. It also maintains diplomatic relations with the former Soviet Bloc countries as well as with the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The government maintains 16 embassies and high commissions around the world.

== Multilateral membership ==
Former President Stevens&#x27; government had sought closer relations with West African countries under the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The present government is continuing this effort.

Sierra Leone is a member of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, the Commonwealth, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Development Bank (AFDB), the Mano River Union (MRU), the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).

Sierra Leone is also a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the US-military (as covered under Article 98).

Sierra Leone is a member state of the Commonwealth of Nations.

==Diplomatic relations==
List of countries which Sierra Leone maintains diplomatic relations with:
==Bilateral relations==

<doc id="308906" wikidata="Q502931" url="?curid=308906" title="Humanoid">
<text>A humanoid (; from English &quot;human&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;resembling&quot;) is a non-human entity with human form or characteristics. By the 20th century, the term came to describe fossils which were morphologically similar, but not identical, to those of the human skeleton.

Although this usage was common in the sciences for much of the 20th century, it is now considered rare. More generally, the term can refer to anything with distinctly human characteristics or adaptations, such as possessing opposable anterior forelimb-appendages (i.e. thumbs), visible spectrum-binocular vision (i.e. having two eyes), or biomechanic plantigrade-bipedalism (i.e. the ability to walk on heels and metatarsals in an upright position). Humanoids may also include human-animal hybrids (where each cell has partly human and partly animal genetic contents) and human-animal chimeras (where some cells are human and some cells are animal in origin). Science fiction media frequently present sentient extraterrestrial lifeforms as humanoid as a byproduct of convergent evolution.

Humanoid characters are defined by their human-like physical characteristics and forms, which can vary. These characters may appear entirely human, predominantly human-like (e.g., Saiyans from &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;), predominantly human-like (e.g., Martians from &quot;DC Comics&quot;), or they may possess general non-human traits while still having human-like physical characteristics (e.g., human-like &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;ThunderCats&quot; characters, various characters from &quot;The Amazing World of Gumball&quot;). In the latter case, they often overlap with anthropomorphic characters, with humanoid characters being a sort of sub-category to anthropomorphism, specifically regarding physical characteristics.

==In theoretical convergent evolution==
Although there are no known humanoid species outside the genus &quot;Homo&quot;, the theory of convergent evolution speculates that different species may evolve similar traits, and in the case of a humanoid these traits may include intelligence and bipedalism and other humanoid skeletal changes, as a result of similar evolutionary pressures. American psychologist and Dinosaur intelligence theorist Harry Jerison suggested the possibility of sapient dinosaurs. In a 1978 presentation at the American Psychological Association, he speculated that dromiceiomimus could have evolved into a highly intelligent species like human beings. In his book, &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;, Stephen Jay Gould argues if the tape of life were re-wound and played back, life would have taken a very different course. Simon Conway Morris counters this argument, arguing that convergence is a dominant force in evolution and that since the same environmental and physical constraints act on all life, there is an &quot;optimum&quot; body plan that life will inevitably evolve toward, with evolution bound to stumble upon intelligence, a trait of primates, crows, and dolphins, at some point.
In 1982, Dale Russell, curator of vertebrate fossils at the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa, conjectured a possible evolutionary path that might have been taken by the dinosaur &quot;Troodon&quot; had it not perished in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago, suggesting that it could have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans, becoming a &quot;humanoid&quot; of dinosaur origin. Over geologic time, Russell noted that there had been a steady increase in the encephalization quotient or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs. Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. If the trend in &quot;Troodon&quot; evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100 cm3; comparable to that of a human. Troodontids had semi-manipulative fingers, able to grasp and hold objects to a certain degree, and binocular vision.

Russell proposed that this &quot;Dinosauroid&quot;, like most dinosaurs of the troodontid family, would have had large eyes and three fingers on each hand, one of which would have been partially opposed. As with most modern reptiles (and birds), he conceived of its genitalia as internal. Russell speculated that it would have required a navel, as a placenta aids the development of a large brain case. However, it would not have possessed mammary glands and would have fed its young, as birds do, on regurgitated food. He speculated that its language would have sounded somewhat like bird song.

Russell&#x27;s thought experiment has been met with criticism from other paleontologists since the 1980s, many of whom point out that his Dinosauroid is overly anthropomorphic. Gregory S. Paul (1988) and Thomas R. Holtz, Jr., consider it &quot;suspiciously human&quot; (Paul, 1988) and Darren Naish has argued that a large-brained, highly intelligent troodontid would retain a more standard theropod body plan, with a horizontal posture and long tail, and would probably manipulate objects with the snout and feet in the manner of a bird, rather than with human-like &quot;hands&quot;. (Although bipedal dinosaurs often do &quot;have&quot; hands, if they don&#x27;t turn them into wings.)

==In robotics==
A humanoid robot is a robot that is based on the general structure of a human, such as a robot that walks on two legs and has an upper torso, or a robot that has two arms, two legs and a head. A humanoid robot does not necessarily look convincingly like a real person, for example, the ASIMO humanoid robot has a helmet instead of a face.

An &quot;android&quot; (male) or &quot;gynoid&quot; (female) is a humanoid robot designed to look as much like a real person as possible, although these words are frequently perceived to be synonymous with a humanoid.

While there are many humanoid robots in fictional stories, some real humanoid robots have been developed since the 1990s, and some real human-looking android robots have been developed since 2002.

Similarly to robots, virtual avatars may also be called humanoid when resembling humans.

==In mythology==
Deities are often imagined in human shape (also known as &quot;anthropotheism&quot;), sometimes as hybrids (especially the gods of Ancient Egyptian religion). 
A fragment by the Greek poet Xenophanes describes this tendency, 

In animism in general, the spirits innate in certain objects (like the Greek nymphs) are typically depicted in human shape, e.g. spirits of trees (Dryads), of the woodlands (the hybrid fauns), of wells or waterways (Nereids, Necks), etc.

==In science fiction==
With regard to extraterrestrials in fiction, the term humanoid is most commonly used to refer to alien beings with a body plan that is generally like that of a human, including upright stance and bipedalism, as well as intelligence.

In much of science fiction, humanoid aliens are abundant. One explanation is that authors use the only example of intelligent life that they know, humans. In live-action television and films, using humanoid aliens makes it easier to cast human actors to portray alien characters. A study by the zoologist Sam Levin suggests that aliens might indeed resemble humans, given that they are presumably subject to natural selection. Levin argues that this can be expected to produce a hierarchy of cooperating systems that make up any organism. Luis Villazon points out that animals that move necessarily have a front and a back; as with animals on Earth, sense organs tend to gather at the front as they encounter stimuli there, forming a head. Legs reduce friction, and with legs, bilateral symmetry makes coordination easier. Sentient organisms will, Villazon argues, likely use tools, in which case they need hands and at least two other limbs to stand on. In short, a generally humanoid shape is likely, though octopus- or starfish-like bodies are also possible. An opposing view is given by Mike Wall, who argues that intelligent extraterrestrials able to contact Humans would most likely have reached a phase allowing them to develop themselves into machines.

Several in-universe explanations have been offered for the abundance of humanoids. One of the more common is that the humanoids in the story have evolved on an Earth-like planet or natural satellite, totally independently from Humans on Earth. However, some works have offered alternative explanations:

In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the explanation is given that a primordial humanoid civilization, the Ancient humanoids, seeded the Milky Way Galaxy with genetically engineered cells to guide the evolution of life on a multitude of worlds toward a humanoid form. In the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the Jaffa are explained as being a hundred-thousand year offshoot of humanity bred by the Goa&#x27;uld to suit their purposes, hence their almost-human appearance and physiology, while many other &quot;alien&quot; characters are actually the descendants of human-slaves who were removed from Earth by the Goa&#x27;uld. Any humans isolated on multiple planets after 100k+ years of adaptations would most certainly seem &quot;alien&quot; to Earthlings. Similarly, in its spin-off show &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, the explanation offered for the humanoid appearance of the Wraith is that the Wraith evolved from a parasite which incorporated human DNA into its own genome after feeding on humans, giving the Wraith their present form.

==In ufology==
In the field of ufology, &quot;humanoid&quot; refers to any of the claimed extraterrestrials which abduct human victims, such as the Greys, the Reptilians, Nordics, and Martians.

==In fantasy==

In fantasy settings the term &quot;humanoid&quot; is used to refer to a human-like fantastical creature, such as a dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, goblin, troll, orc or an ogre, and Bigfoot. In some cases, such as older versions of the game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, a distinction is made between demi-humans, which are relatively similar to humans, and humanoids, which exhibit larger differences from humans. Animals that are humanoid are also shown in fantasy. Humanoids are also used in some old horror movies, for example in &quot;Creature From the Black Lagoon&quot;, made in 1954 by Jack Arnold.

<doc id="308909" wikidata="Q376644" url="?curid=308909" title="Invisible hand">
<text>The invisible hand is a metaphor inspired by the Scottish economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith that describes the incentives which free markets sometimes create for self-interested people to accidentally act in the public interest, even when this is not something they intended. Smith originally mentioned the term in two specific, but different, economic examples. It is used once in his &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; when discussing a hypothetical example of wealth being concentrated in the hands of one person, who wastes his wealth, but thereby employs others. More famously, it is also used once in his &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, when arguing that governments do not normally need to force international traders to invest in their own home country. In &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; (1759) and in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776) Adam Smith speaks of &quot;an&quot; invisible hand, never of &quot;the&quot; invisible hand.

Going far beyond the original intent of Smith&#x27;s metaphor, twentieth century economists, especially Paul Samuelson, popularized the use of the term to refer to a more general and abstract conclusion that truly free markets are self-regulating systems that always tend to create economically optimal outcomes, which in turn can&#x27;t be improved upon by government intervention. The idea of trade and market exchange perfectly channelling self-interest toward socially desirable ends is a central justification for newer versions of the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic philosophy which lie behind neoclassical economics.

Adam Smith was a proponent of less government intervention in his own time, and of the possible benefits of a future with more free trade both domestically and internationally. However, in a context of discussing science more generally, Smith himself once described &quot;invisible hand&quot; explanations as a style suitable for unscientific discussion, and he never used it to refer to any general principle of economics. His argumentation against government interventions into markets were based on specific cases, and were not absolute. Putting the invisible hand itself aside, while Smith&#x27;s various ways of presenting the case against government management of the economy were very influential, they were also not new. Smith himself cites earlier enlightenment thinkers such as Bernard Mandeville. Smith&#x27;s invisible hand argumentation may have also been influenced by Richard Cantillon and his model of the isolated estate.

Because the modern use of this term has become a shorthand way of referring to a key neoclassical assumption, disagreements between economic ideologies are now sometimes viewed as disagreement about how well the &quot;invisible hand&quot; is working. For example, it is argued that tendencies that were nascent during Smith&#x27;s lifetime, such as large-scale industry, finance, and advertising, have reduced the effectiveness of the supposed invisible hand.

==History of the terms and concepts==
The term &quot;invisible hand&quot; has classical roots, and it was relatively widely used in 18th-century English. Adam Smith&#x27;s own usage of the term did not attract much attention until many generations after his death. In his early unpublished essay on &quot;The History of Astronomy&quot; (written before 1758) he specifically described this type of explanation as a common and unscientific way of thinking. Smith wrote that superstitious people, or people with no time to think philosophically about complex chains of cause and effect, tend to explain irregular, unexpected natural phenomena such as &quot;thunder and lightning, storms and sunshine&quot;, as acts of favour or anger performed by &quot;gods, daemons, witches, genii, fairies&quot;. For this reason the philosophical or scientific study of nature can only begin when there is social order and security, so that people are not living in fear, and can be attentive. Because of this background, a wide range of interpretations have been given to the fact that Smith himself used the metaphor twice when discussing economic topics. On one extreme it has been argued that Smith was literally suggesting that divine intervention is at play in the economy, and at the other extreme it has been suggested that Smith&#x27;s use of this metaphor shows that he was being sarcastic.

The modern conception of a free market causing the best possible economic result, which is now commonly associated with the term &quot;invisible hand&quot;, also developed further, going beyond Smith&#x27;s conception. It has been influenced by arguments for free markets found not only in Smith&#x27;s works, but also by earlier writers such as especially Bernard Mandeville, and later more mathematical approaches by economists such as Pareto and Marshall.

==Adam Smith&#x27;s use of the term in economics==
=== &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; ===
The invisible hand is explicitly mentioned only once in the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, in a specialized chapter not about free trade but about capital investment, which discusses the concern that international merchants might choose to invest in foreign countries. Smith argues that a self-interested investor will have a natural tendency to employ his capital as near home as he can, as long as the home market does not give much lower returns than other alternatives. This in turn means...
As noted by William D. Grampp, this example involves &quot;a particular condition that may or may not be present in a transaction on a competitive market&quot;. Essentially, the invisible hand refers to the unintended positive consequences self-interest has on the promotion of community welfare. Nevertheless, Smith draws a practical implication in this case is that legislators should not intervene too hastily in many (if not all) cases:
According to Grampp:
=== &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; ===
Smith&#x27;s first use of the invisible hand metaphor occurs in &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot; (1759) in Part IV, Chapter 1, where he describes a selfish landlord being led by an invisible hand to distribute his harvest to those who work for him. This passage concerns the distribution of wealth: the poor receive the &quot;necessities of life&quot; after the rich have gratified &quot;their own vain and insatiable desires&quot;. It has been noted that in this passage Smith seems to equate the invisible hand to &quot;Providence&quot;, implying a divine plan.
Although this passage concerns an economic topic in a broad sense, it does not concern &quot;the invisible hand&quot; of the free market as understood by twentieth century economists, but is instead about income distribution. There is no repeat of this argumentation in Smith&#x27;s comprehensive work on economics in his later &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, and income distribution is not a central concern of modern neoclassical market theory. As Blaug noted in the &quot;New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics&quot; this passage &quot;dispels the belief that Smith meant one thing and one thing only by the metaphor of &#x27;the invisible hand&#x27;.&quot; Grampp has claimed that if there is any connection between this passage and Smith&#x27;s other one, &quot;it has not been demonstrated with evidence from what Smith actually wrote&quot;.

== The reinterpretation by modern economists ==

In contrast to Smith&#x27;s own usage, the &quot;invisible hand&quot; today is often seen as being specifically about the benefits of voluntary transactions in a free market, and is treated as a generalizable rule. Paul Samuelson&#x27;s comments in his &quot;Economics&quot; textbook in 1948 made the term popular and gave it a new meaning. The phrase was not originally commonly referred to among economists before the twentieth century. Alfred Marshall never used it in his &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; textbook and neither does William Stanley Jevons in his &quot;Theory of Political Economy&quot;. Samuelson&#x27;s remark was as follows:

In this interpretation, the theory is that the Invisible Hand states that if each consumer is allowed to choose freely what to buy and each producer is allowed to choose freely what to sell and how to produce it, the market will settle on a product distribution and prices that are beneficial to all the individual members of a community, and hence to the community as a whole. The reason for this is that self-interest drives actors to beneficial behavior in a case of serendipity. Efficient methods of production are adopted to maximize profits. Low prices are charged to maximize revenue through gain in market share by undercutting competitors. Investors invest in those industries most urgently needed to maximize returns, and withdraw capital from those less efficient in creating value. All these effects take place dynamically and automatically.

Since Smith&#x27;s time, this concept has been further incorporated into economic theory. Léon Walras developed a four-equation general equilibrium model that concludes that individual self-interest operating in a competitive market place produces the unique conditions under which a society&#x27;s total utility is maximized. Vilfredo Pareto used an Edgeworth box contact line to illustrate a similar social optimality. Ludwig von Mises, in &quot;Human Action&quot; uses the expression &quot;the invisible hand of Providence&quot;, referring to Marx&#x27;s period, to mean evolutionary meliorism. He did not mean this as a criticism, since he held that secular reasoning leads to similar conclusions. Milton Friedman, a Nobel Memorial Prize winner in economics, called Smith&#x27;s Invisible Hand &quot;the possibility of cooperation without coercion.&quot; Kaushik Basu has called the First Welfare Theorem the Invisible Hand Theorem.

Some economists question the integrity of how the term &quot;invisible hand&quot; is currently used. Gavin Kennedy, Professor Emeritus at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, argues that its current use in modern economic thinking as a symbol of free market capitalism is not reconcilable with the rather modest and indeterminate manner in which it was employed by Smith. In response to Kennedy, Daniel Klein argues that reconciliation is legitimate. Moreover, even if Smith did not intend the term &quot;invisible hand&quot; to be used in the current manner, its serviceability as such should not be rendered ineffective. In conclusion of their exchange, Kennedy insists that Smith&#x27;s intentions are of utmost importance to the current debate, which is one of Smith&#x27;s association with the term &quot;invisible hand&quot;. If the term is to be used as a symbol of liberty and economic coordination as it has been in the modern era, Kennedy argues that it should exist as a construct completely separate from Adam Smith since there is little evidence that Smith imputed any significance onto the term, much less the meanings given it at present.

The former Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford, D. H. MacGregor, argued that:

Harvard economist Stephen Marglin argues that while the &quot;invisible hand&quot; is the &quot;most enduring phrase in Smith&#x27;s entire work&quot;, it is &quot;also the most misunderstood.&quot;

According to Emma Rothschild, Smith was actually being ironic in his use of the term. Warren Samuels described it as &quot;a means of relating modern high theory to Adam Smith and, as such, an interesting example in the development of language.&quot;

Proponents of liberal economics, for example Deepak Lal, regularly claim that the invisible hand allows for market efficiency through its mechanism of acting as an indicator of what the market considers important, or valuable.

== Understood as a metaphor ==
Smith uses the metaphor in the context of an argument against protectionism and government regulation of markets, but it is based on very broad principles developed by Bernard Mandeville, Bishop Butler, Lord Shaftesbury, and Francis Hutcheson. In general, the term &quot;invisible hand&quot; can apply to any individual action that has unplanned, unintended consequences, particularly those that arise from actions not orchestrated by a central command, and that have an observable, patterned effect on the community.

Bernard Mandeville argued that private vices are actually public benefits. In &quot;The Fable of the Bees&quot; (1714), he laments that the &quot;bees of social virtue are buzzing in Man&#x27;s bonnet&quot;: that civilized man has stigmatized his private appetites and the result is the retardation of the common good.

Bishop Butler argued that pursuing the public good was the best way of advancing one&#x27;s own good since the two were necessarily identical.

Lord Shaftesbury turned the convergence of public and private good around, claiming that acting in accordance with one&#x27;s self-interest produces socially beneficial results. An underlying unifying force that Shaftesbury called the &quot;Will of Nature&quot; maintains equilibrium, congruency, and harmony. This force, to operate freely, requires the individual pursuit of rational self-interest, and the preservation and advancement of the self.

Francis Hutcheson also accepted this convergence between public and private interest, but he attributed the mechanism, not to rational self-interest, but to personal intuition, which he called a &quot;moral sense&quot;. Smith developed his own version of this general principle in which six psychological motives combine in each individual to produce the common good. In &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;, vol. II, page 316, he says, &quot;By acting according to the dictates of our moral faculties, we necessarily pursue the most effective means for promoting the happiness of mankind.&quot;

Contrary to common misconceptions, Smith did not assert that all self-interested labour necessarily benefits society, or that all public goods are produced through self-interested labour. His proposal is merely that in a free market, people &quot;usually&quot; tend to produce goods desired by their neighbours. The tragedy of the commons is an example where self-interest tends to bring an unwanted result.

The invisible hand is traditionally understood as a concept in economics, but Robert Nozick argues in &quot;Anarchy, State and Utopia&quot; that substantively the same concept exists in a number of other areas of academic discourse under different names, notably Darwinian natural selection. In turn, Daniel Dennett argues in &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot; that this represents a &quot;universal acid&quot; that may be applied to a number of seemingly disparate areas of philosophical inquiry (consciousness and free will in particular), a hypothesis known as Universal Darwinism. Positing an economy guided by this principle as ideal may amount to Social Darwinism, which is also associated with champions of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism.

=== Tawney&#x27;s interpretation ===
Christian socialist R. H. Tawney saw Smith as putting a name on an older idea:

== Criticisms ==

===Joseph E. Stiglitz===
The Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, says: &quot;the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there.&quot; Stiglitz explains his position:

The preceding claim is based on Stiglitz&#x27;s 1986 paper, &quot;Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets&quot;, which describes a general methodology to deal with externalities and for calculating optimal corrective taxes in a general equilibrium context. In it he considers a model with households, firms and a government.

Households maximize a utility function formula_1, where formula_2 is the consumption vector and formula_3 are other variables affecting the utility of the household (e.g. pollution). The budget constraint is given by formula_4, where q is a vector of prices, ahf the fractional holding of household h in firm f, πf the profit of firm f, Ih a lump sum government transfer to the household. The consumption vector can be split as formula_5.

Firms maximize a profit formula_6, where yf is a production vector and p is vector of producer prices, subject to formula_7, Gf a production function and zf are other variables affecting the firm. The production vector can be split as formula_8.

The government receives a net income formula_9, where formula_10 is a tax on the goods sold to households.

It can be shown that in general the resulting equilibrium is not efficient.

===Noam Chomsky===

Noam Chomsky suggests that Smith (and more specifically David Ricardo) sometimes used the phrase to refer to a &quot;home bias&quot; for investing domestically in opposition to offshore outsourcing production and neoliberalism.
===Stephen LeRoy===
Stephen LeRoy, professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, offered a critique of the Invisible Hand, writing that &quot;The single most important proposition in economic theory, first stated by Adam Smith, is that competitive markets do a good job allocating resources. (...) The financial crisis has spurred a debate about the proper balance between markets and government and prompted some scholars to question whether the conditions assumed by Smith...are accurate for modern economies.

===John D. Bishop===
John D. Bishop, a professor who worked at Trent University, Peterborough, indicates that the invisible hand might be applied differently to merchants and manufacturers from how it is applied with society. He wrote an article in 1995 titled &quot;Adam Smith&#x27;s Invisible Hand Argument&quot;, in which he suggests that Smith might be contradicting himself with the &quot;Invisible Hand&quot;. He offers various critiques of the &quot;Invisible Hand&quot;, and he writes that &quot;the interest of business people are in fundamental conflict with the interest of society as a whole, and that business people pursue their personal goal at the expense of the public good&quot;. Thus, Bishop indicates that the &quot;business people&quot; are in conflict with society over the same interests and that Adam Smith might be contradicting himself. According to Bishop, he also gives the impression that in Smith&#x27;s book &#x27;The Wealth of Nations,&#x27; there&#x27;s a close saying that &quot;the interest of merchants and manufacturers were fundamentally opposed of society in general, and they had an inherent tendency to deceive and oppress society while pursuing their own interests.&quot; Bishop also states that the &quot;invisible hand argument applies only to investing capital in one&#x27;s own country for a maximum profit.&quot; In other words, he suggests that the invisible hand applies to only the merchants and manufacturers and that they&#x27;re not the invisible force that moves the economy. He contends the argument &quot;does not apply to the pursuit of self-interest (...) in any area outside of economic activities&quot;.

=== Thomas Piketty ===
French economist Thomas Piketty notes that although the Invisible Hand does exist and thus that economic imbalances correct themselves over time, those economic imbalances may lead to an extended unoptimal utility, which could be solved thanks to non-commercial processes. He takes for instance the cases of real estate of which imbalances may last decades, and of the Great Famine of Ireland, which could have been avoided by shipments of food from Great Britain to areas in crisis without waiting for new bread producers to come.

<doc id="308915" wikidata="Q29714" url="?curid=308915" title="Infiniti">
<text>(stylized in all caps) is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Corporation. The brand began on November 8, 1989, initially in North America. The marketing network for Infiniti vehicles included dealers in over 50 countries in the 2010s. As of 2020, there were 25 markets served by new car dealers, primarily North America, China, Taiwan, and the Middle East.

According to Nissan, the Infiniti logo is a stylized representation of a road extending to the horizon—and of Mount Fuji, reflecting its Japanese origins.

==History==
===The beginning===
The Infiniti brand was introduced in the United States in 1989 to target the premium vehicle segments in the United States that would not have otherwise fit in with Nissan&#x27;s mainstream offering, and partially influenced by the Plaza Accord of 1985. The brand was created around the same time rivals Toyota and Honda developed their Lexus and Acura premium brands, respectively. As the Japanese government invoked voluntary export restraints, it became more effective for automakers to export fewer but more expensive cars to the U.S. market.

The marque launched with two models, the Q45, and the M30 that were previously sold at Japanese &quot;Nissan Store&quot; dealership networks. The Q45 was based on the all new second generation JDM Nissan President on a five millimeter shorter wheelbase platform at 2,875 mm (113.2 in). Starting with model year 1992, the wheelbase matched the President&#x27;s wheelbase at 2880 mm (113.4 in). The Q45 included a V8 engine, four wheel steering, and active suspension system offered on the first generation Q45t. The car&#x27;s features would have made it competitive in the full-sized &quot;luxury&quot; segment against the Mercedes S-Class, BMW 7 Series, Jaguar XJ and Cadillac Fleetwood.

A second model was introduced in November 1989, the two-door M30, a badge engineered Nissan Leopard. It remained in production for three years as an alternative to the Lexus SC. The powertrain was the VG30E engine and an automatic transmission. The M30 coupe was underpowered for its stock weight of . The M30 convertible weighed even more, due to the required body and chassis reinforcements. The appearance of the M30 had almost no resemblance to the larger Q45, and the interior was almost completely different.

Infiniti did not offer a mid-luxury sedan to match the first Japanese luxury sedan introduced to North America, the Acura Legend, which was later joined by the Lexus GS. Infiniti&#x27;s first offering in the entry-level luxury segment was the Infiniti J30, which had to compete with the revised 1992 Lexus ES and was unsuccessful owing to its small interior and unusual styling to which it was succeeded in 1996 by the Infiniti I series introduced previously in April 1995, related to the Nissan Maxima and in 2002 by the Infiniti G35.

Infiniti&#x27;s global network includes over 230 dealers in 15 countries.

===1990s===

In September 1990, Infiniti introduced a third model, the Infiniti G20, derived from the compact and European-focused Nissan Primera.

In 1992 for the 1993 model year, Infiniti introduced a four-door coupé J30 with only one engine option, the VG30DE. This engine was from the 300ZX, the JDM Nissan Cedric, Nissan Gloria and the Nissan Cima, and was the North American version of the third generation JDM Nissan Leopard.

Infiniti sales were slow. The company&#x27;s initial campaign aimed to bring about brand awareness with Zen-influenced spots that focused on nature and tranquility, without showing the actual cars. Designers decided not to adorn the interiors with wood accents and chrome brightwork, opting instead for a monochrome, organic and rounded surface appearance, focusing on padded leather and vinyl throughout. Some buyers had faux wood appliques added to areas surrounding the center console and around the interior door handles. The only item that had a bright appearance was the centrally installed analog clock in all models, a design that is currently maintained by the designers.

By the mid-1990s, Infiniti was lagging behind Lexus and Acura in sales. The Q45 had retreated considerably from its focused, taut rendition of a sporty full-size luxury sedan, having become a barely recognizable, ponderously handling sedan that earned the nickname &quot;The Japanese Lincoln&quot;. In the summer of 1998, Infiniti revived the G20, based on the JDM Nissan Primera, a compact sport sedan. The second generation G20 was marketed as a competitor to European entry-level luxury sport sedans, but it now weighed more than the first generation version. Because Infiniti continued to use the SR20DE four-cylinder engine and compact size, it fell short of sales expectations. The G20 was also marketed primarily to the wrong demographic, that being middle-aged professional women, and as such it was not as popular new as its main competition, the similarly priced Acura Integra.

In late 1996, Infiniti released the QX4, modifying and adding premium accommodations to the Nissan Pathfinder, becoming one of the first luxury car manufacturers to offer a mid-size premium SUV.

Infiniti replaced the J30 mid-sized rear drive sedan with the second-generation JDM Nissan Cefiro, giving it the North American designation &quot;I30&quot; in 1996. It offered one engine, the VQ30DE with front wheel drive shared with the Maxima. The I30 was redesigned for the 2000 model year, featuring an increase in power to 231 PS (170 kW; 227 hp). Infiniti made further changes to the I30&#x27;s appearance and performance in mid-2001, upgrading the engine to the more powerful 259 PS (190 kW; 255 hp) VQ35DE; this inspired a name change to the vehicle, which became the I35. Sales and the brand, bereft of an image or a following, floundered.

===2000s===

By 2000, large Japanese companies were feeling the effect of the Japanese asset price bubble, and the reduced desirability of Infinitis led to it facing extinction. The company rededicated itself to developing a dynamic and powerful line-up of sporty luxury cars. This coincided with parent company Nissan entering into an alliance with Renault under the direction of Carlos Ghosn and the Nissan Revival Plan. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; reported that Infiniti executives invited members of the motoring press to a meeting where they &quot;swore never again to take their eyes off BMW.&quot; Although this effort began with a completely redesigned Q45 flagship for the 2002 model year in early 2001, it was the G35 that helped improve Infiniti sales by 2003. In Japan, Nissan had a well established reputation with premium level performance sedans after Nissan acquired the Prince Motor Company and integrated the Nissan Skyline, Nissan Laurel and Nissan Gloria, originally Prince vehicles, in 1966–1968. A sports sedan replacing its Nissan Primera-based predecessor (the G20), the Nissan Skyline-based Infiniti G35, was successful after it was voted Motor Trend Car of the Year in 2003.

The release of the sport-tuned FX35/45 crossover that same year piggybacked on the G35&#x27;s success. The FX used the same components as the G35 sport coupe and was designed for American tastes. It combined good handling and performance with station wagon-like versatility and all-weather capability. In 2004, Infiniti added an all-wheel drive version of the G35 sports sedan to compete with similar all-wheel drive sports sedans from Audi and BMW. Infiniti also introduced a larger SUV to compete with the Toyota Land Cruiser/Lexus LX470. This was the 2004 Infiniti QX56 based on the U.S. market Nissan Armada.

Nissan Motors President and CEO, Carlos Ghosn, developed a business strategy to break Infiniti away from its Nissan roots. The G series helped re-define Infiniti as the &quot;Japanese BMW&quot;, as it was aimed directly at the BMW 3 Series of sedans and coupes. The M35/M45 garnered acclaim from the automotive press, winning an eight-car comparison test in &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, and the model was named the best luxury sedan by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;. The M45 model featured the same engine as the Q45, and the M45 became the flagship model after the Q45 was discontinued. The Infiniti M (2002–2005) and the Infiniti G (starting in 2002) were known in Japan as the Nissan Gloria and the Nissan Skyline.

In November 2006 for the 2007 model year a redesigned version of the G35 sedan was launched, followed in August 2007 by a new version of the company&#x27;s G coupe, the G37. The coupe was first unveiled at the New York International Auto Show in April 2007. Also released in (December) 2007 was new Infiniti EX35 compact crossover, Infiniti&#x27;s entry into the compact luxury crossover market. The EX shared the G35&#x27;s 3.5-liter, , V6 engine.

Carlos Ghosn unveiled Infiniti&#x27;s arrival in Europe at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. The official launch was late 2008, and was phased over a two-year period across 21 European countries. Four models are offered in Europe: the next generation of the Infiniti FX37 and Infiniti FX50 performance SUV, the Infiniti G37, the Infiniti G37 coupe, and the Infiniti EX37 crossover. Infiniti Europe&#x27;s headquarters are in Rolle, Switzerland.

===2010s===

Carlos Ghosn unveiled the Infiniti M at a hotel in Los Angeles. It shares the VQ37VHR from the Infiniti G, and Nissan 370Z. Featured are new powertrains: the 5.6 L V8 (VK56VD) with VVEL, Gasoline direct injection, the Nissan-Renault V9X Engine V6 Turbo Diesel (only for Europe), and the newly developed hybrid that includes one electric motor and two clutches to allow the gas engine and electric motor to drive the rear wheels simultaneously. The lithium-ion battery pack was first displayed in the Essence concept car.

At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Infiniti launched a new powertrain for Europe, with the new V9X Engine developed by the Renault-Nissan Alliance. The new engine is used in the Infiniti FX, Infiniti EX, and the new Infiniti M. The new Infiniti M made its European debut at the show.

In August 2010 Infiniti unveiled its new performance division named Infiniti Performance Line, or IPL. Soon thereafter in 2011, Infiniti chose to sponsor the Renault engines for Red Bull Racing for the 2011 Formula One season.

As of 2011, the G Series (consisting of the sedan, coupe, and convertible) accounted for 60% of sales. This was attributed to their SUVs (including crossovers) which were seen as aimed at the narrowest of niches, a lost opportunity as SUVs were popular in the U.S. market. In contrast, at archrival Lexus, SUVs contributed half of the sales volume. In 2011, Infiniti sales fell, while other import luxury vehicles were doing well. Furthermore, Infiniti&#x27;s performance over practicality emphasis has resulted in its crossovers and SUVs faring poorly among women compared to offerings from Acura and Lexus.

Nissan announced the return of front-wheel drive to the Infiniti lineup on August 30, 2011, with the release of the Infiniti JX. It joins Toyota&#x27;s Lexus brand in terms of blending front-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive vehicles again; since its inception in 1989, Lexus has had front-wheel drive platforms underpinning entry-level vehicles like the Lexus ES and Lexus RX. More importantly, the JX was meant to give Infiniti a credible rival to the Acura MDX and BMW X5 crossovers that offer optional three-row seating.

In 2012, Infiniti moved its global headquarters from the Nissan corporate building in Yokohama and incorporated in Hong Kong as Infiniti Global Limited, with Carlos Ghosn intending for Infiniti to have a greater focus on the burgeoning luxury market in mainland China as it forecast the country to become the largest luxury car market. Nissan appointed Roland Krüger, former head of BMW&#x27;s Asian division, as president of Infiniti in September 2014.

In mid-2013 Infiniti announced their Q30 Concept car would get its world premiere at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, a move which would see Infiniti start an aggressive strategy to extend the Infiniti brand into new premium segments. In 2013, Infiniti&#x27;s model designation changed to the coupes and sedans starting with the letter Q (SUVs and crossovers starting with the letters QX) and a number reflecting the model&#x27;s place in the brand lineup. The M sedan became the Q70 while the G sedan was replaced with the Q50; meanwhile, the QX56 became the QX80 while the EX became the QX50.

In August 2013 Infiniti announced that Simone Piattelli Palmarini would take up the role as head of public relations for Infiniti EMEA. Known to many in the media, Simone had previously worked for Pirelli and Ferrari.

With its QX60 crossover (formerly known as JX35) Infiniti began to produce vehicles outside Japan. In 2014, it started producing two models in Xiangyang, China, a plant operated by Nissan&#x27;s joint venture with Dongfeng Motor. At the same time, Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK expanded in Sunderland, England, to produce a new compact car named Q30 in 2015. In mid-2019, the Sunderland plant ceased assembly of Infiniti vehicles in the United Kingdom.

Johan de Nysschen was appointed to head the Infiniti division in 2012. De Nysschen left the company as of August 2014 to become CEO of Cadillac. Infiniti Chairman Andy Palmer assumed de Nysschen&#x27;s responsibilities. Nissan appointed Roland Krüger, former head of BMW&#x27;s Asian division, as president of Infiniti after the chairman of the marque, Andy Palmer, resigned to join Aston Martin in September 2014.

In January 2018, chief executive Hiroto Saikawa announced that the Infiniti brand would be transformed into an electric brand, with all new vehicles either being hybrid or all-electric by 2021.

In 2019, Infiniti announced that the brand would be leaving the Western European market. This is due to a combination of poor sales and the uncertain Brexit outcome. Furthermore, Infiniti was lacking brand equity and remained a niche player in the premium car market dominated by the longtime three German luxury marques (Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz). Infiniti stated its intent to focus on the Chinese (excluding Hong Kong and Macau), Middle East, and North American markets instead, where most of the brand&#x27;s sales come from. Subsequently, the QX30 and Q30 produced at the Nissan factory in Sunderland were to cease production. Similarly, on September 3, 2019, it was announced that Infiniti would leave Australia and New Zealand due to slow sales in the region.

Accordingly, Infiniti left the European (with the exception of Caucasus, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine), South African, Australian, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysian, Singaporean, South Korean, and Vietnamese markets in 2020. In South Korea, sales of Nissan and Infiniti had dropped after &quot;consumer sentiment against Japanese products intensified&quot;, leading to both marques being discontinued there, as the Nissan Motor Company never made a profit in South Korea during its tenure in the South Korean auto market from 2005 until its exit in 2020, due to the Korean opposition towards everything associated with Japan. It also relocated its headquarters from Hong Kong to Yokohama, Japan, where parent company Nissan is located.

In November 2021, Nissan stated that its Infiniti brand will become 100 percent all-electric by 2030, ending production and new car sales of fossil fuel powered Infiniti vehicles by that year.

In March 2022, Nissan withdrew entirely from Russia and Belarus as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, effectively ending all production in Russia, exports into Russia and Belarus, and new car sales of Nissan and Infiniti vehicles in those countries as a result of huge sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus by the European Union, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States.

==Sales by calendar year==
==Models==
Infiniti&#x27;s former model name designation included one letter for coupés and sedans, two letters for SUVs, and a number reflecting engine displacement. For example, the QX56 was an SUV featuring a 5.6L engine. An exception to this was the QX4 SUV, which featured a 3.3L engine (1996–2000) and later a 3.5L engine (2000–2003). An &quot;x&quot; following the engine displacement of Infiniti sedans denoted an all wheel drive model (e.g. Infiniti G35x), &quot;s&quot; denoted a sport package, &quot;h&quot; denoted a hybrid model, and &quot;d&quot; denoted a diesel model.

In 2013, Infiniti&#x27;s model designation changed to the coupes and sedans starting with the letter Q, the SUVs and crossovers starting with the letters QX, and a number reflecting the model&#x27;s place in the brand lineup. The M sedan became the Q70, the G coupe became the Q60, and the G sedan became the Q50; meanwhile, the QX56 became the QX80, the FX became the QX70, the JX became the QX60 and the EX became the QX50.

==Infiniti Performance Line==
In August 2010, Infiniti unveiled its new performance marque named Infiniti Performance Line, or IPL.

==Motorsports==
In 1996, Nissan launched an effort to compete in the Indy Racing League with the Infiniti brand. The engine chosen for the Indy cars was a racing variant of the VH engine used in the production Q45s. Eddie Cheever resulted third in the 2000 season. The IRL program was quietly wrapped after the 2002 season after a few wins.

In 2011, Infiniti began sponsoring Formula One team Red Bull Racing, which was chosen due to the team&#x27;s already existing collaboration with the Renault-Nissan Alliance, with Renault supplying engines to Red Bull Racing. In 2011, Infiniti signed Formula One World Champion Sebastian Vettel as its first global ambassador. Infiniti ended its sponsorship of the team after the 2015 season.

The establishment of Renault F1 Team in 2016 by the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance provided Infiniti with the opportunity to evolve its involvement in Formula One, collaborating on three main projects. Infiniti contributes engineering resources to Renault F1 Team for the co-development of the Power Unit&#x27;s Energy Recovery System (ERS), including relocating several of their specialists to the Renault F1 Team&#x27;s facilities in France. In addition, the Infiniti Engineering Academy provides for engineering students to collaborate with the Renault F1 Team. Infiniti and the Renault F1 team also collaborate on Project Black S, a road car that features an ERS inspired by the one used in Formula One.

In 2020, a few Infiniti Q50s were entered into the British Touring Car Championship by Laser Tools Racing. They won the drivers&#x27; championship with Ash Sutton at the wheel that year and the subsequent year.

<text>Murtala Ramat Muhammed (; 8 November 1938 – 13 February 1976) was a Nigerian military officer and the fourth head of state of Nigeria. He led the 1966 Nigerian counter-coup in overthrowing the military regime of Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi and featured prominently during the Nigerian Civil War and thereafter ruled Nigeria from 29 July 1975 until his assassination on 13 February 1976. This period in Nigerian history, from the Northern counter-coup victory to Murtala&#x27;s death, is commonly associated with the institutionalization of the military in Nigerian politics.

Born in Kano into a ruling-class religious family, Murtala served in the Nigerian Army as a cadet in the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. He later served in Congo; eventually rose through the ranks to become brigadier general in 1971, aged 33, becoming one of the youngest generals in Nigeria. Three years later, Murtala became the Federal Commissioner for Communications in Lagos. As a conservative and federalist, Murtala regretted the overthrow of the First Republic and the promulgation of Aguiyi Ironsi&#x27;s unification decree of 1966. He was devastated by the assassination of Sir Ahmadu Bello, and for a time seriously considered the secession of Northern Nigeria. His career redoubled after Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu and the young majors orchestrated the first military coup in Nigeria of 1966 empowering him to lead the mutiny of the night of 29 July 1966 in Abeokuta. Murtala was briefly considered as Supreme Commander before the appointment of Yakubu Gowon.

During the war, he commanded Nigeria&#x27;s second infantry division which was responsible for the death of civilians and many of the rebels. Three years later the Federal military government declared victory which bolstered Murtala&#x27;s image over Nigeria and in particular the north as a military leader through the post-war era of &quot;reconciliation, reconstruction, and rehabilitation&quot;. In post-civil-war Nigeria, Murtala ruled with more power than any Nigerian leader before or since and developed a charismatic authority and cult of personality. During the Cold War he maintained Nigerian neutrality through participation in the non-aligned movement but supported the Soviet Union — during the latter&#x27;s effort in the Angolan Civil War. This support is better understood within the context of the liberation of African countries from colonialism than as support for the Soviet Union.

At the same time, his regime transitioned from being authoritarian into consensus decision-making with Murtala the leader of a military triumvirate, alongside Generals Olusegun Obasanjo and Theophilus Danjuma. The dictatorship softened and Murtala unveiled plans for the demilitarization of politics. In 1976, barely seven months into his nascent rule Murtala without having time to see his plans implemented was assassinated in a failed coup d&#x27;ètat, being succeeded by Olusegun Obasanjo as Head of State, who, in turn, led the Nigerian transition to democracy with the Second Nigerian Republic.

The legacy of Murtala in Nigerian history remains controversial as the nature of his rule changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Nigeria. His dictatorial style proved highly adaptable, which enabled wide-ranging social and economic reform, while consistent pursuits during his reign centered on highly centralised government, authoritarianism, federalism, national Federalism, and pan-Africanism.

==Early life==
Murtala&#x27;s father, Muhammed Riskuwa, was from the Fulani Genawa clan
which has a history of knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence, as both his paternal grandfather Suleman and paternal great-grandfather were judges. 

Mohammed Riskuwa served as Chief Judge in Kano Emirate and held the title of chief Alkali of Kano. His father worked in the Kano Native Authority and was related to Aminu Kano, Inuwa Wada, and Aminu Wali. He died in 1953, his mother, Uwani Rahamatu, was from the Kanuri and Fulani Jobawa clan, the Jobawa clan members include the Makama of Kano and Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila, his maternal grandfather Yakubu Soja a World War I veteran was from Dawakin Tofa while his maternal grandmother Hajiya Hauwau (Aya) was from Gezawa, he was educated at Cikin Gida Elementary School which was inside the emir&#x27;s palace.

He then transferred to Gidan Makama primary school in Kano which was just outside the palace. He then proceeded to Kano Middle School (now Rumfa College, Kano) in 1949, before attending the famous Government College (now Barewa College) in Zaria, where he obtained his school certificate in 1957. At Barewa College, Muhammed was a member of the Cadet Corps and was captain of shooting in his final year. In 1957, he obtained a school leaving certificate and applied to join the Nigerian army later in the year.

== Early career ==
Murtala Muhammed joined the Nigerian Army in 1958. He spent short training stints in Nigeria and Ghana and then was trained as an officer cadet at Sandhurst Royal Military Academy in England. After his training, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1961 and assigned to the Nigerian Army Signals that same year, later spending a short stint with the No. 3 Brigade Signals Troop in Congo. In 1962, Muhammed was appointed aide-de-camp to M. A. Majekodunmi, the federally-appointed administrator of the Western Region.

In 1963, he became the officer-in-charge of the &quot;First Brigade Signal Troop&quot; in Kaduna, Nigeria. That year he traveled to the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick Garrison, England for a course on advanced telecommunications techniques. On his return to Nigeria in 1964, he was promoted to major and appointed officer-commanding, 1st Signal Squadron in Apapa, Lagos. In November 1965, he was made acting Chief of Signals of the Army, while his paternal uncle, Inuwa Wada had recently been appointed Defense Minister.

Unknown to Muhammed, majors planning the January 1966 coup recruited troops from the signal unit. The coup plotters later went on to assassinate leading politicians and soldiers from the Northern and Western region. After the coup plot failed, new military postings made by the new leader generated some discomfort in the North. In April 1966, Muhammed was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was the inspector of signals posted to Army Headquarters, Lagos in a move that was partly to pacify Northerners weary about the new military regime. Muhammed was also appointed member of a Post and Telecommunications management committee. Muhammed opposed the regime of Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, which took power after a coup d&#x27;etat on 15 January 1966.

Aguiyi-Ironsi, as GOC of the Nigerian Army, brought normalcy back to the nation by imprisoning the coup makers and intimidating the federal cabinet into handing over the helms of government to him. However, many northerners saw this and the reluctance of Ironsi to prosecute the coup leaders, and the fact that the army was purportedly giving exceptional privileges to the coupist as an indication of Ironsi&#x27;s support for the killings. Consequently, northern politicians and civil servants mounted pressure upon northern officers such as Muhammed to avenge the coup. The promulgation of Decree No. 34 restructuring Nigeria from a federal constitutional structure to a unitary structure also raised suspicions among many Northern officers and Muhammed and a few others began to contemplate separation of the Northern region from the country.

== 1966 counter-coup ==
On the night of 29 July 1966, northern soldiers at Abeokuta barracks mutinied, thus precipitating a counter-coup, which may very well have been in the planning stages. A group among the officers supported secession and thus gave the code name of the coup &#x27;A raba&#x27; meaning secession in Hausa. However, after the success of the counter-coup, a group of civilians including the Chief Justice Adetokunbo Ademola, Sule Katagum, head of the Federal Public service and Musa Daggash, Permanent Secretary, defense convinced the plotters including Muhammed about the advantages of a union.

The counter-coup led to the installation of Lieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon as Supreme Commander of the Nigerian Armed Forces, despite the intransigence of Muhammed who wanted the role of Supreme Commander for himself. However, as Gowon was militarily his senior, and finding a lack of support from the British and American advisors, he caved in. Gowon rewarded him by confirming his ranking (he had been an acting Lt. Colonel until then) and his appointment (Inspector of Signals). The acceptance of Gowon as the Head of State was not supported by all the key military leaders, in particular, Odumegwu Ojukwu, military governor of the Eastern Region.

==Civil war==
At the start of the Nigerian Civil War, Muhammed was the commander of the newly established 2nd Infantry Division. The 2 Division was responsible for the beating back of the Biafran Army from the Mid-West region, as well as crossing the River Niger and linking up with the 1 Division, which was advancing from Nsukka and Enugu. However, this was only achieved after several failed river crossings in which thousands of troops died as a result of drowning or enemy fire. During his time as commander, Muhammed was implicated in several violations of appropriate conduct; Lieutenant Ishola Williams, an officer who served under Muhammed alleged that he ordered the summary execution of Biafran prisoners of war.

In June 1968, he relinquished his commanding position and was posted to Lagos and appointed Inspector of Signals. In April 1968, he was promoted to colonel. The actions of the division during this period, mostly in Asaba became a subject of speculation. In a book published in 2017, S. Elizabeth Bird and Fraser Ottanelli document the 1967 mass murder of civilians by troops of the 2 Division under General Muhammed&#x27;s command. They also discuss the events leading up to the massacre, and its impact on Asaba and on the progress of the war, as well as other civilian massacres carried out by soldiers of the 2nd Division at Onitsha and Isheagu.

== Military service ==
Between 1970 and 1971, he attended the Joint Service Staff College in England, his supervisor&#x27;s report attributed him to having &quot;a quick agile mind, considerable ability and common sense. He holds strong views which he puts forward in a forthright manner. He is a strong character and determined. However, he finds it difficult to moderate his opinions and finds it difficult to enter into debate with others whose views he may not share&quot;. After the war, he was promoted to brigadier-general in October 1971. Between 1971 and 1974, Muhammed was involved in routine activities within the signals unit of the army. However, he also disagreed with some of the policies being pursued by Gowon.

On 7 August 1974, the head of state, General Yakubu Gowon appointed him as the new Federal Commissioner for Communications, which he combined with his military duties as Inspector of Signals at the Army Signals Headquarters in Apapa, Lagos. On 7 August 1974, General Yakubu Gowon appointed Muhammed as the Federal commissioner (position now called Minister) for communications to oversee and facilitate the nation&#x27;s development of cost effective communication infrastructures during the oil boom. After the war and after he took power as head of state, Muhammed started the reorganization and demobilization of 100,000 troops from the armed forces. The number of troops in the armed forces decreased from 250,000 to 150,000.

== In government ==
On 29 July 1975, General Yakubu Gowon was overthrown while attending the 12th summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in Kampala, Uganda. Muhammed took power as the new military Head of State. Brigadiers Obasanjo and Danjuma (both later Lt. Generals) were appointed as Chief of Staff of the Supreme Military HQ and Chief of Army Staff, respectively.

=== Charisma ===
In the coup d&#x27;état that brought him to power he introduced the phrases &quot;Fellow Nigerians&quot; and &quot;with immediate effect&quot; to the national lexicon. In a short time, Murtala Muhammed&#x27;s policies won him broad popular support, and his decisiveness elevated him to the status of a folk hero.

However his highly popular, often televised &quot;with immediate effect&quot; style of governing, also gained some criticism amongst the countries top civil servants - some of which were Nigeria’s top intellectuals. His ad-hoc Presidential proclamations left his civil service often unprepared, lacking details or even funding to implement his ideas, and his administration led to the dismissal of thousands of civil servants. Over 10,000 civil servants, government employees were dismissed without benefits; reasons stated were age, health, incompetence, or malpractice. The removal of such a large number of public officials affected the public service, the judiciary, the police and armed forces, the diplomatic service, public corporations, and university officials. Quite a few officials were tried on corruption charges, and an ex-military state governor was executed for gross office misconduct.

=== National federalism ===
Muhammed took federal control of the country&#x27;s two largest newspapers – Daily Times and New Nigerian; all media in Nigeria was now under federal control. He also took federal control of the remaining state-run universities. On February 3, 1976, the Military Government of Murtala Muhammed created new states and renamed others, the states he created include: Bauchi, Benue, Borno, Imo, Niger, Ogun, and Ondo. This brought the total number of states in Nigeria to nineteen in 1976.

As head of state, Muhammed put in place plans to build a new Federal Capital Territory due to Lagos being overcrowded. He set up a panel headed by Justice Akinola Aguda, which chose the Abuja area as the new capital ahead of other proposed locations. On 3 February 1976, Muhammed announced that the federal capital would in the future move to a federal territory location of about 8,000 square kilometres in the central part of the country.

Towards the end of 1975, the administration implemented a mass purge in the Nigerian civil service. The civil service was viewed as undisciplined and lacking a sense of purpose. A retrenchment exercise was implemented as part of a strategy to refocus the service. However, because of the drastic nature of the purge, allegations that malice and revenge was used by heads of department in recommending people for retrenchment surfaced, and little was done to scrutinize the details and reasons staff were disengaged.

=== Economic policy ===
As head of state Murtala Muhammed inherited an immense amount of oil and petroleum resources and enormous but untapped natural gas reserves. But in 1975, Muhammed saw reduced revenue due to low levels of petroleum production; this meant that the military government lacked the projected funds to meet Nigeria&#x27;s development plan for 1975. The decline in petroleum production in 1975 was due to a global fall in demand, high costs of spare parts and high labour costs.

==Death==

On 13 February 1976, General Muhammed set off for work along his usual route on George Street. Shortly after 8 a.m., his Mercedes-Benz car travelled slowly in the infamous Lagos traffic near the Federal Secretariat at Ikoyi in Lagos and a group of soldiers, members of an abortive coup led by Lt. Col. Bukar Suwa Dimka, emerged from an adjacent petrol station, ambushed the vehicle and assassinated Muhammed.

Murtala Muhammed was killed, aged 37, along with his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Akintunde Akinsehinwa, and his Driver sergeant Adamu Michika in his black Mercedes Benz saloon car on 13 February 1976. The only visible sign of protection was a pistol carried by his orderly, making his assassination an easy task. The assassination was part of an attempted coup led by Dimka, who was later tried and executed on 15 May 1976 for treason.

==Legacy==
Today, Muhammed&#x27;s portrait adorns the 20 Naira note and Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos is named in his honour.

== Marriage ==
Murtala Muhammed was married to Ajoke. They had six children together.They are Aisha, Zakari (deceased), Fatima, Abba (also known as Risqua), Zeliha and Jummai. Abba Muhammed was a Special Adviser to President Olusegun Obasanjo on privatisation.

==Medals==

Murtala Muhammed had received several awards and medals. In alphabetical order they included:

* Forces Service Star (FSS) 
* General Service Medal (GSM) 
* Meritorious Service Star (MSS)
* National Service Medal (NSM) 
* Republic Medal (RM)

<text>Dulcinea del Toboso is a fictional character who is unseen in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Don Quixote believes he must have a lady, under his personal view that chivalry requires it.
As he does not have one, he invents her, making her the very model of female perfection: &quot;[h]er name is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank must be at least that of a princess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, I think and imagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare&quot; (Part I, Chapter 13, translation of John Ormsby).

Don Quixote is portrayed as both admirable (&quot;and doth she not of a truth accompany and adorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind!&quot; &quot;that, winnowed by her hands, beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest.&quot;) and ridiculous throughout the novel. Sancho knows this, and is enthusiastic for Dulcinea in as much as &quot;if your worship goes looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea&quot;.

Dulcinea is based on the Spanish word &quot;dulce&quot; (sweet), and suggests an overly elegant &quot;sweetness&quot;. To this day, a reference to someone as one&#x27;s &quot;Dulcinea&quot; implies idealistic devotion and love for her.

==Spurious Part II of the work==
An unidentified writer using the pseudonym Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda in 1614 published a Part II of &quot;Don Quijote&quot;.

Although support for Avellaneda&#x27;s view of Dulcinea is found in Part I of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, he has little interest in the glorious, imaginary Dulcinea. Scholars commonly say that because of this and many similar misreadings by Avellaneda, which Cervantes found offensive, he was motivated to complete his own unfinished Part II, which was published the following year. (&quot;...especially my lady the princess Dulcinea, who staggers one&#x27;s senses.&quot; &quot;...who went skipping and capering like goats over the pleasant fields there...&quot;)

==Opera==
The Jules Massenet opera &quot;Don Quichotte&quot; depicts Dulcinée as a major character, the local queen who sends the knight on a quest to retrieve her jewels.

==In popular culture==
* A prostitute named Aldonza is the female lead and identified as &quot;Dulcinea&quot; in &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, an adaptation of the Quixote story, and its subsequent movie adaptation.
* The French composer Maurice Ravel composed &quot;Don Quichotte à Dulcinée&quot; (1932–33), a cycle of three songs for baritone voice and accompaniment.
*Dulcinea is the female lead in the TV series &quot;The Adventures of Puss in Boots&quot;.
*Dulcinea appears in the Japanese series &quot;Zukkoke Knight – Don De La Mancha&quot;. Her real name is Fedora (in the English dub). She is the daughter of the bandit king Poormouth. Her role is to help her bankrupt father by stealing, but she fails almost every time. She fools Don Quixote into helping her. She is voiced by Mami Koyama.
*&quot;Dulcinea&quot; is the title of the first episode of the Syfy television show &quot;The Expanse&quot;.
*Dulcinea Septimus is the name of the heir to the Seventh House in the The Locked Tomb series of novels, and her relationship to Palamedes Sextus follows the format of a beautiful lady out of reach.
*Dulcinea (Don Quixote With A Guitar) is a cowpunk song by musician Peter Ray. The lyrics are about a man infatuated with a beautiful woman. The man is likened to “Don Quixote With A Guitar,” his “head full of dreams, and a heart full of pain. Strumming life away, as he slowly goes insane.” The song ends mimicking the man singing of his beloved, referring to her as, “Dulcinea, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh.”
*In Canto VII of the South Korean video &quot;Limbus Company&quot;, Dulcinea is one of the &quot;kindreds&quot; of the video game&#x27;s interpretation of Alonso Quijano. Dulcinea is also the leader of the parade of &quot;La Mancha land&quot; and serves as the second boss of the act who resides in the third area of the Canto.

<doc id="308930" wikidata="Q927919" url="?curid=308930" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)">
<text>The Phantom of the Opera is a 1925 American silent horror film adaptation of Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel of the same name directed by Rupert Julian and starring Lon Chaney in the title role of the deformed Phantom who haunts the Paris Opera House, causing murder and mayhem in an attempt to make the woman he loves a star. The film remains most famous for Chaney&#x27;s ghastly, self-devised make-up, which was kept a studio secret until the film&#x27;s premiere. The picture also features Mary Philbin, Norman Kerry, Arthur Edmund Carewe, Gibson Gowland, John St. Polis and Snitz Edwards. The last surviving cast member was Carla Laemmle (1909–2014), niece of producer Carl Laemmle, who played a small role as a &quot;prima ballerina&quot; in the film when she was about 15 years old. The first cut of the film was previewed in Los Angeles on January 26, 1925. The film was released on September 6, 1925, premiering at the Astor Theatre in New York.

In 1953, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the film&#x27;s distributor Universal Pictures did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.

==Plot==
&quot;The following synopsis is based on the general release version of 1925, which has additional scenes and sequences in different order than the existing reissue print.&quot;

At the Paris Opera House, Comte Philippe de Chagny and his brother, the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny attend a production of &quot;Faust&quot;, where the latter&#x27;s sweetheart, Christine Daaé, may sing. Raoul wishes for Christine to resign and marry him, but she prioritizes her career over their relationship.

Meanwhile, the former management has sold the opera house. While leaving, they tell the new managers about the Opera Ghost, a phantom who is &quot;the occupant of box No. 5&quot;.

Mme. Carlotta, the prima donna, receives a letter from &quot;The Phantom,&quot; demanding that Christine replace her the following night, threatening dire consequences if this does not happen. In Christine&#x27;s dressing room, a voice tells her she must take Carlotta&#x27;s place and think only of her career and her master.

The following day, Christine reveals to Raoul that she has been tutored by a mysterious voice, the &quot;Spirit of Music,&quot; and it is now impossible to stop her career. Raoul says someone is probably playing a joke on her, and she storms off in anger.
That evening, Christine substitutes for Carlotta. During the performance, the managers are startled to see, seated in Box 5, a figure who later disappears. Simon Buquet then finds the body of his brother, stagehand Joseph Buquet, hanging by a noose and vows vengeance. Once again, a note from the Phantom demands Carlotta say she is ill and let Christine replace her. The managers get a similar note, reiterating that if Christine does not sing, they will present &quot;Faust&quot; in a cursed house.

The following evening, a defiant Carlotta sings. During the performance, the Phantom drops the chandelier hanging from the ceiling onto the audience, killing people. Christine enters a secret door behind the mirror in her dressing room, descending into the lower depths of the Opera. She meets the Phantom, who introduces himself as Erik and declares his love. Christine faints and he carries her to an underground suite fabricated for her comfort. The next day, she finds a note from Erik telling her that she must never look behind his mask. As he is preoccupied playing his organ, Christine playfully tears off his mask, revealing his deformed face. Enraged, the Phantom declares she is now his prisoner. She begs him to let her sing, and he relents, allowing her to visit the surface one last time if she promises not to see Raoul again.

Released, Christine meets with Raoul at the annual masked ball, where the Phantom appears disguised as the &quot;Red-Death.&quot; On the roof of the Opera House, Christine tells Raoul about her experiences. Unbeknownst to them, the Phantom is listening nearby. Raoul swears to whisk Christine away to London following her next performance. As they leave the roof, a man with a fez approaches them. Aware that the Phantom awaits downstairs, he leads Christine and Raoul to another exit.

The next night, during her performance, Christine is kidnapped. Raoul rushes to her dressing room and meets the man in the fez again. He is actually Inspector Ledoux, a secret policeman who has been tracking Erik since he escaped as a prisoner from Devil&#x27;s Island. After finding the secret door in Christine&#x27;s room, the two men enter the Phantom&#x27;s lair. They end up in a torture chamber of his design. Philippe also finds his way into the catacombs, looking for his brother, but is eventually drowned by Erik.

The Phantom subjects Raoul and Ledoux to intense heat. He then locks them in with barrels of gunpowder and causes the room to flood. Christine begs Erik to save Raoul, promising him anything in return, even becoming his wife. This causes the Phantom to save Raoul and Ledoux.

A mob led by Simon Buquet infiltrates Erik&#x27;s lair. As they approach, the Phantom attempts to flee with Christine. Raoul saves Christine while Erik, in one last act of twisted showmanship, frightens the crowd by pretending to hold some kind of lethal entity in his clenched fist, only to reveal an empty palm before he is swarmed and killed by the mob and thrown into the Seine. Raoul and Christine later go on their honeymoon in Viroflay.

==Cast==


==Pre-production==

In 1922, Carl Laemmle, the president of Universal Pictures, took a vacation to Paris. During his vacation Laemmle met the author Gaston Leroux, who was working in the French film industry. Laemmle mentioned to Leroux that he admired the Paris Opera House. Leroux gave Laemmle a copy of his 1910 novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. Laemmle read the book in one night and bought the film rights as a vehicle for actor Lon Chaney. Production was scheduled for late 1924 at Universal Studios.

The filmmakers were unfamiliar with the layout of the Paris Opera House and consulted Ben Carré, a French art director who had worked at the Opera and was familiar with Leroux&#x27;s novel. He said Leroux&#x27;s depiction of the Opera cellars was based more on imagination than fact. Carré created twenty-four detailed charcoal sketches of the back and below-stage areas of the Opera, which the filmmakers replicated. Carré was in Europe when shooting began and had nothing more to do with the project; not until he was shown a print of the film in the 1970s did he realize his designs had been used.

The screenplay was written by Elliot J. Clawson, who had worked as the scenario writer of director Rupert Julian since 1916. His first script was a close adaptation of Leroux and included scenes from the novel that never appeared in the released film, such as the Phantom summoning Christine to her father&#x27;s grave in Brittany, where he poses in the cemetery as the &quot;Angel of Music&quot; and plays &quot;The Resurrection of Lazarus&quot; on his violin at midnight. The scene was filmed by Rupert Julian but excised after he left the project.

Inspired by the novel, Clawson added a lengthy flashback to Persia, where Erik (the Phantom) served as a conjurer and executioner in the court of a depraved Sultana, using his Punjab lasso to strangle prisoners. Falling from her favor, Erik was condemned to be eaten alive by ants. He was rescued by the Persian (the Sultana&#x27;s chief of police, who became &quot;Inspector Ledoux&quot; in the final version of the film), but not before the ants had consumed most of his face. The flashback was eliminated during subsequent story conferences, possibly for budgetary reasons. Instead, a line of dialogue was inserted to explain that Erik had been the chief torturer and inquisitor during the Paris Commune, when the Opera served as a prison, with no explanation of his damaged face.

The studio considered the novel&#x27;s ending too low-key, but Clawson&#x27;s third revised script retained the scene of Christine giving the Phantom a compassionate kiss. He is profoundly shaken and moans &quot;Even my own mother would never kiss me.&quot; A mob approaches led by Simon (the brother of a stagehand who was murdered earlier by the Phantom). Erik flees the Opera House with Christine. He takes over a coach, which overturns thanks to his reckless driving, and then escapes the mob by scaling a bridge with the aid of his strangler&#x27;s lasso. Waiting for him at the top is Simon, who cuts the lasso. The Phantom suffers a deadly fall. His dying words are &quot;All I wanted... was to have a wife like anybody else... and to take her out on Sundays.&quot;

The studio remained dissatisfied. In another revised ending, Erik and Christine flee the mob and take refuge in her house. Before entering, Erik cringes &quot;as Satan before the cross&quot;. Inside her rooms, he is overcome and says he is dying. He asks if she will kiss him and proposes to give her a wedding ring, so Christine can give it to Raoul. The Persian, Simon, and Raoul all burst into the house. Christine tells them Erik is ill; he slumps dead to the floor, sending the wedding ring rolling across the carpet. Christine sobs and flees to the garden; Raoul follows to console her.

==Production==

Production began in mid-October and did not go smoothly. According to director of photography Charles Van Enger, Chaney and the rest of the cast and crew had strained relations with director Rupert Julian. Eventually the star and director stopped talking, so Van Enger served as a go-between. He would report Julian&#x27;s directions to Chaney, who responded &quot;Tell him to go to hell.&quot; As Van Enger remembered, &quot;Lon did whatever he wanted.&quot;

Rupert Julian had become Universal&#x27;s prestige director by completing the &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1923) close to budget, after original director Eric von Stroheim had been fired. But on the set of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; his directorial mediocrity was obvious to the crew. According to Van Enger, Julian had wanted the screen to go black after the chandelier fell on the opera audience. Van Enger ignored him and lit the set with a soft glow, so the aftermath of the fall would be visible to the film audience.

The ending changed yet again during filming. The scripted chase scene through Paris was discarded in favor of an unscripted and more intimate finale. To save Raoul, Christine agrees to wed Erik and she kisses his forehead. Erik is overcome by Christine&#x27;s purity and his own ugliness. The mob enters his lair under the Opera House, only to find the Phantom slumped dead over his organ, where he had been playing his composition &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot;.

By mid-November 1924, the majority of Chaney&#x27;s scenes had been filmed. Principal photography was completed just before the end of the year, with 350,000 feet of negative exposed. Editor Gilmore Walker assembled a rough cut of nearly four hours. The studio demanded a length of no more than 12 reels.

A score was prepared by Joseph Carl Breil. No information about the score survives other than Universal&#x27;s release: &quot;Presented with augmented concert orchestra, playing the score composed by Briel, composer of music for &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. The exact quote from the opening day full-page ad in the &quot;Call-Bulletin&quot; read: &quot;Universal Weekly&quot; claimed a 60-piece orchestra. &quot;Moving Picture World&quot; reported that &#x27;The music from &quot;Faust&quot; supplied the music [for the picture].

The first cut of the film was previewed in Los Angeles on January 26, 1925. Audience reaction was extremely negative and summed up by the complaint &quot;There&#x27;s too much spook melodrama. Put in some gags to relieve the tension.&quot; By March the studio had decided against the ending and decided the Phantom should not be redeemed by a woman&#x27;s kiss: &quot;Better to have kept him a devil to the end.&quot; The &quot;redemptive&quot; ending is now lost, with only a few frames still surviving.

The New York premiere was cancelled, and the film was rushed back into production, with a new script that focused more on Christine&#x27;s love life. It is unknown whether Rupert Julian walked away from the production or was fired; in any case, his involvement with the film had ended. To salvage the film, Universal called upon the journeymen of its Hoot Gibson western unit, who worked cheaply and quickly.
Edward Sedgwick (later the director of Buster Keaton&#x27;s 1928 film &quot;The Cameraman&quot;) was then assigned by producer Laemmle to direct a reshoot of the bulk of the film. Raymond L. Schrock and original screenwriter Elliot Clawson wrote new scenes at Sedgewick&#x27;s request. The film was then changed from the dramatic thriller that was originally made into more of a romantic comedy with action elements. Most of the new scenes depicted added subplots, with Chester Conklin and Vola Vale as comedic relief to the heroes, and Ward Crane as the Russian Count Ruboff dueling with Raoul for Christine&#x27;s affection. This version was previewed in San Francisco on April 26, 1925, and did not do well at all, with the audience booing it off of the screen. &quot;The story drags to the point of nauseam&quot;, one reviewer stated.

The third and final version resulted from Universal holdovers Maurice Pivar and Lois Weber editing the production down to nine reels. Most of the Sedgwick material was removed, except for the ending, with the Phantom being hunted by a mob and then being thrown into the Seine River. Much of the cut Julian material was edited back into the picture, though some important scenes and characters were not restored. This version, containing material from the original 1924 shooting and some from the Sedgwick reworking, was then scheduled for release. It debuted on September 6, 1925, at the Astor Theatre in New York City. The score for the Astor opening was to be composed by Professor Gustav Hinrichs. However, Hinrichs&#x27; score was not prepared in time, so instead, according to &quot;Universal Weekly&quot;, the premiere featured a score by Eugene Conte, composed mainly of &quot;French airs&quot; and the appropriate &quot;Faust&quot; cues. No expense was spared at the premiere; Universal even had a full organ installed at the Astor for the event. (As it was a legitimate house, the Astor theater used an orchestra, not an organ, for its music.) Vaudeville stars Broderick &amp; Felsen created a live prologue for the film&#x27;s Broadway presentation at the B.S. Moss Colony Theater beginning on November 28, 1925.

===Makeup===
Following the success of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; in 1923, Chaney was once again given the freedom to create his own makeup, a practice which became almost as famous as the films he starred in.

Chaney commented &quot;In &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, people exclaimed at my weird make-up. I achieved the Death&#x27;s Head of that role without wearing a mask. It was the use of paints in the right shades and the right places—not the obvious parts of the face—which gave the complete illusion of horror ... It&#x27;s all a matter of combining paints and lights to form the right illusion.&quot;

Chaney used a color illustration of the novel by Andre Castaigne as his model for the phantom&#x27;s appearance. He raised the contours of his cheekbones by stuffing wadding inside his cheeks. He used a skullcap to raise his forehead height several inches and accentuate the bald dome of the Phantom&#x27;s skull. Pencil lines masked the join of the skullcap and exaggerated his brow lines. Chaney then glued his ears to his head and painted his eye sockets black, adding white highlights under his eyes for a skeletal effect. He created a skeletal smile by attaching prongs to a set of rotted false teeth and coating his lips with greasepaint. To transform his nose, Chaney applied putty to sharpen its angle and inserted two loops of wire into his nostrils. Guide-wires hidden under the putty pulled his nostrils upward. According to cinematographer Charles Van Enger, Chaney suffered from his make-up, especially the wires, which sometimes made him &quot;bleed like hell&quot;.

When audiences first saw the movie, they were said to have screamed or fainted during the scene where Christine pulls the concealing mask away, revealing his skull-like features.
Chaney&#x27;s appearance as the Phantom in the film has been the most accurate depiction of the title character based on the description given in the novel, where the Phantom is described as having a skull-like face with a few wisps of black hair on top of his head. As in the novel, Chaney&#x27;s Phantom has been deformed since birth, rather than having been disfigured by acid or fire, as in later adaptations of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

===Soundstage 28===

Producer Laemmle commissioned the construction of a set of the Paris Opera House. Because it would have to support hundreds of extras, the set became the first to be created with steel girders set in concrete. For this reason it was not dismantled until 2014. Stage 28 on the Universal Studios lot still contained portions of the opera house set, and was the world&#x27;s oldest surviving structure built specifically for a movie, at the time of its demolition. It was used in hundreds of movies and television series. In preparation for the demolition of Stage 28, the Paris Opera House set went through a preservation effort and was placed into storage. Stage 28 was completely demolished on September 23, 2014.

==Reception==

===Initial response===
Initial critical response for the film was mostly positive.
Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review as a spectacle picture, but felt that the story and acting may have been slightly improved. &quot;TIME&quot; praised the sets but felt the picture was &quot;only pretty good&quot;.
&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; is not a bad film from a technical viewpoint, but revolving around the terrifying of all inmates of the Grand Opera House in Paris by a criminally insane mind behind a hideous face, the combination makes a welsh rarebit look foolish as a sleep destroyer.&quot;

===Modern response===

Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, writing &quot;It creates beneath the opera one of the most grotesque places in the cinema, and Chaney&#x27;s performance transforms an absurd character into a haunting one.&quot; Adrian Warren of PopMatters gave the film 8/10 stars, summarizing, &quot;Overall, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; is terrific: unsettling, beautifully shot and imbued with a dense and shadowy Gothic atmosphere. With such a strong technical and visual grounding it would have been difficult for Chaney to totally muck things up, and his performance is indeed integral, elevating an already solid horror drama into the realms of legendary cinema.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; gave the film a mostly positive review, criticizing the film&#x27;s &quot;hobbling exposition&quot;, but praised Chaney&#x27;s performance as being the best version of the title character, as well as the film&#x27;s climax.

TV Guide gave the film 4/5 stars, stating, &quot;One of the most famous horror movies of all time, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; still manages to frighten after more than 60 years.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; holds an approval rating of 90% based on from June 2002 to October 2020, with a weighted average rating of 8.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Decades later, it still retains its ability to scare – and Lon Chaney&#x27;s performance remains one of the benchmarks of the horror genre.&quot;

==1929 reissue with sound==
After the successful introduction of sound pictures during the 1928–29-movie season, Universal announced that they had secured the rights to a sequel to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; from the Gaston Leroux estate. Entitled &quot;The Return of the Phantom&quot;, Gaston Leroux himself was brought on-board to write the treatment for the film in which the phantom would survive his fate and come back to stalk Christine further, It&#x27;s said that Leroux wrote this treatment with a tongue-in-cheek, self aware &amp; satirical style, the picture would have sound and for the first time be in color. Universal could not use Chaney in the film as he was now under contract at MGM.

Universal later scrapped the sequel, and instead opted to reissue &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; with a new synchronized score and sound effects track, as well as a few new dialog sequences. Directors Ernst Laemmle and Frank McCormick reshot little less than half of the picture with sound during August 1929, Some scenes from the film including the scene at the graveyard and original bal masque scenes were cut for this release and are now lost. The footage that was reused from the original film was scored with music arranged by Joseph Cherniavsky, and sound effects. Mary Philbin and Norman Kerry reprised their roles for the sound reshoot, and Edward Martindel, George B. Williams, Phillips Smalley, Ray Holderness, and Edward Davis were added to the cast to replace actors who were unavailable. Universal was contractually unable to loop Chaney&#x27;s dialogue, so another character was introduced who acts as a messenger for the Phantom in some scenes. Because Chaney&#x27;s talkie debut was eagerly anticipated by filmgoers, advertisements emphasised, &quot;Lon Chaney&#x27;s portrayal is a silent one!&quot;

The sound version of &quot;Phantom&quot; opened on 15 December 1929. While a financial success pulling in an additional million dollars for the studio, this version of the film was reportedly given a mixed to negative reception with most audiences being both underwhelmed and confused. It was particularly criticized by Lon Chaney who was reportedly angered by the decision to proceed without him and give his dialogue to a newly created assistant to the Phantom. This resulted in Chaney&#x27;s relationship with Universal straining and contributed to his hesitancy to sign on to &quot;Dracula&quot; prior to his death.

The sound version is currently thought to most likely be lost as Universal&#x27;s archived reels were reportedly burned in a studio fire in 1948, although the soundtrack discs survived, to which fans have produced extensive re-constructions since the film fell into the public domain.

The success of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; inspired Universal to finance the production of a long string of horror films through to the 1950s, starting with the base stories of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941), and continuing with numerous sequels to all five films.

==Differences from the novel==
Although this particular adaptation is often considered the most faithful, it contains some significant plot differences from the original novel.

In the movie, M. Debienne and M. Poligny transfer ownership of the Opera to M. Montcharmin and M. Richard, while in the novel they are simply the old and new managers.

The character of Ledoux is not a mysterious Persian and is no longer a onetime acquaintance of the Phantom. He is now a French detective of the Secret Police. This character change was not originally scripted; it was made during the title card editing process.

The Phantom has no longer studied in Persia in his past. Rather, he is an escapee from Devil&#x27;s Island and an expert in &quot;the Black Arts&quot;.

As described in the &quot;Production&quot; section of this article, the filmmakers initially intended to preserve the original ending of the novel, and filmed scenes in which the Phantom dies of a broken heart at his organ after Christine leaves his lair. Because of the preview audience&#x27;s poor reaction, the studio decided to change the ending to a more exciting chase sequence. Edward Sedgwick was hired to provide a climactic chase scene, with an ending in which the Phantom, after having saved Ledoux and Raoul, kidnaps Christine in Raoul&#x27;s carriage. He is hunted down and cornered by an angry mob, who beat him to death and throw him into the Seine.

==Preservation and home video status==
The finest quality print of the film existing was struck from an original camera negative for George Eastman House in the early 1950s by Universal Pictures. The original 1925 version survives only in 16mm &quot;Show-At-Home&quot; prints created by Universal for home movie use in the 1930s. There are several versions of these prints, but none of them are complete. All are from the original domestic camera negative.

Because of the better quality of the Eastman House print, many home video releases have opted to use it as the basis of their transfers. This version has singer Mary Fabian in the role of Carlotta. In the reedited version, Virginia Pearson, who played Carlotta in the 1925 film, is credited and referred to as &quot;Carlotta&#x27;s Mother&quot; instead. Most of the silent footage in the 1929 version is actually from a second camera, used to photograph the film for foreign markets and second negatives; careful examination of the two versions shows similar shots are slightly askew in composition in the 1929 version. In 2009, ReelClassicDVD issued a special edition multi-disc DVD set which included a matched shot side-by-side comparison of the two versions, editing the 1925 Show-At-Home print&#x27;s narrative and continuity to match the Eastman House print.

For the 2003 Image Entertainment–Photoplay Productions two-disc DVD set, the 1929 soundtrack was reedited in an attempt to fit the Eastman House print as best as possible. However, there are some problems with this attempt. There is no corresponding &quot;man with lantern&quot; sequence on the sound discs. While the &quot;music and effect&quot; reels without dialogue seem to follow the discs fairly closely, the scenes with dialogue (which at one point constituted about 60% of the film) are generally shorter than their corresponding sequences on the discs. Also, since the sound discs were synchronized with a projection speed of 24 frames per second (the established speed for sound film), and the film on the DVD is presented at a slower frame rate (to reproduce natural speed), the soundtrack on the DVD set has been altered to run more slowly than the originally recorded speed. A trailer for the sound reissue, included for the first time on the DVD set, runs at the faster sound film speed, with the audio at the correct pitch.

On November 1, 2011, Image Entertainment released a new Blu-ray version of &quot;Phantom&quot;, produced by Film Preservation Associates, the film preservation company owned by David Shepard.

On January 10, 2012, Shadowland Productions released &quot;The Phantom of the Opera: Angel of Music Edition&quot;, a two-disc DVD set featuring a newly recorded dialogue track with sound effects and an original musical score. The film was also reedited, combining elements from the 1925 version with the 1929 sound release. A 3D anaglyph version is included as an additional special feature.

===Eastman House print mystery===

James Card, the curator of the Eastman House, obtained the Eastman print from a 35mm acetate print in 1950 from Universal. It is uncertain for what purpose the negative used to strike the Eastman House print was produced, as it includes footage from the 1929 sound reissue, and shows few signs of wear or damage. The fact that the print originally had a title card with a Western Electric Sound System credit, however, prove that it was intended as some sort of sound version. The removed title card included credits for cameramen, synchronization and score. Current extant copies of the Eastman print have a jump cut in the titles where this title once was.

For unknown reasons, an opening prologue showing a man with a lantern has been added—using a single continuous take—but no corresponding title cards or dialogue survive. This shot seems to have been a talking sequence, but it shows up in the original 1925 version, shorter in duration and using a different, close-up shot of the man with the lantern. Furthermore, the opening title sequence, the lantern man, the footage of Mary Fabian performing as Carlotta, and Mary Philbin&#x27;s opera performances are photographed at 24 frames per second (sound film speed), and therefore were shot after the movie&#x27;s original release. It is possible that the lantern man is meant to be Joseph Buquet, but the brief remaining close-up footage of this man from the 1925 version does not appear to be of Bernard Siegel, who plays Buquet. The man who appears in the reshot footage could be a different actor as well, but since there is no close-up of the man in this version, and the atmospheric lighting partially obscures his face, it is difficult to be certain.

While it was common practice to simultaneously shoot footage with multiple cameras for prints intended for domestic and foreign markets, the film is one of few for which footage of both versions survives (others include Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; and Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;). Comparisons of the two versions (both in black and white and in color) yield:
# Footage of most of the scenes shot from two slightly different angles
# Different takes for similar scenes
# 24 fps sound scenes replacing silent scene footage
# Variations in many rewritten dialogue and exposition cards, in the same font

Some possibilities regarding the negative&#x27;s intended purpose are:
# It is an International Sound Version for foreign markets.
# It is a negative made for Universal Studios&#x27; reference.

====International sound version====

&quot;International sound versions&quot; were sometimes made of films which the producing companies judged not to be worth the expense of reshooting in a foreign language. These versions were meant to cash in on the talkie craze; by 1930 anything with sound did well at the box office, while silent films were largely ignored by the public. International sound versions were basically part-talkies, and were largely silent except for musical sequences. Since the films included synchronized music and sound effect tracks, they could be advertised as sound pictures, and therefore capitalize on the talkie craze in foreign markets without the expense of reshooting scenes with dialogue in foreign languages.

To make an international version, the studio would simply replace any spoken dialogue in the film with music, and splice in some title cards in the appropriate language. Singing sequences were left intact, as well as any sound sequences without dialogue.

The sound discs for the &quot;International Sound Version&quot; are not known to be extant. The sound discs for the domestic sound version of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; are extant, but do not synchronize with the dialogue portions of the foreign version, which have been abbreviated on the Eastman House print. &quot;The International Sound Version&quot; is known to have played in Brazil as a reviews of it exists. The &quot;International Sound Version&quot; is also known to have played in Italy and Germany as surviving reviews prove. The existing print may therefore have been used as a master negative to strike prints to be sent overseas and then stored for safekeeping. This would explain why the Eastman House print shows no signs of negative wear.

Furthermore, the Eastman print originally had a Western Electric sound credit in the starting credits. This credit was removed by James Card who obtained the Eastman print from a 35mm acetate print in 1950 from Universal. In the edited Eastman print that is currently available, there is a jump cut, which removes the production credits including cameramen, synchronization and score. This same card carried the &quot;Western Electric Sound System&quot; credit.

====Silent version====
The (now missing) sound credit on the Eastman print proves that it could not have been a silent version. During the transition to sound in 1930, it was not uncommon for two versions of a picture, one silent and one sound, to play simultaneously (particularly for a movie from Universal, which kept a dual-format policy longer than most studios).

However, according to trade journals, no silent reissue was available. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, which was always careful to specify whether or not a silent version of a movie was made, specifically stated that &quot;there will be no silent version.&quot;

Furthermore, no silent version was needed as the 1925 version was already silent. If a theatre not wired for sound wanted to show the film they would have had to exhibit the 1925 silent version.

===Color preservation===
According to &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, when the film was originally released, it contained 17 minutes of color footage; this footage was retained in the 1930 part-talking version. Technicolor&#x27;s records show 497 feet of color footage. Judging from trade journals and reviews, all of the opera scenes of &quot;Faust&quot; as well as the &quot;Bal Masqué&quot; scene were shot in Process 2 Technicolor (a two-color system). Prizmacolor sequences were also shot for the &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Night&quot; introduction. Until recently, only the &quot;Bal Masqué&quot; scene survived in color; however in 2020, color footage of the ballet scene was found by the Dutch archive Eye Filmmuseum and uploaded to YouTube. In the scene on the rooftop of the opera, the Phantom&#x27;s cape was colored red, using the Handschiegl color process. This effect has been replicated by computer colorization in the 1996 restoration by Kevin Brownlow&#x27;s Photoplay Productions.

As with many silent films, black-and-white footage was tinted various colors to provide mood. These included amber for interiors, blue for night scenes, green for mysterious moods, red for fire, and yellow (sunshine) for daylight exteriors.

==Legacy==
In 1998 &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; was added to the United States National Film Registry, having been deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. It was included, at No. 52, in Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;.

It is listed in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

In the United States, the film is in the public domain because Universal did not renew the copyright in 1953.

<text>Beatrice &quot;Bebe&quot; Jane Neuwirth ( ; born December 31, 1958) is an American actress, singer, and dancer. Known for her roles on stage and screen, she has received two Emmy Awards, two Tony Awards, and two Drama Desk Awards.

Neuwirth made her Broadway debut in the musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; in 1980. She went on to receive two Tony Awards, the first for Best Featured Actress in a Musical playing Nickie in the revival of &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1986) and received her second for Best Actress in a Musical for Velma Kelly in the revival of &quot;Chicago&quot; (1996). She has also starred as Lola in the revival of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1994) and Morticia Addams in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (2010). She was nominated for another Tony Award for her performance as Fräulein Schneider in &quot;Cabaret&quot; (2024).

On television, her breakthrough role was as Dr. Lilith Sternin, Frasier Crane&#x27;s wife on the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, as well as guest appearances in its spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot; and the 2023 &quot;Frasier&quot; revival. The role earned her two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Neuwirth was cast as Bureau Chief/ADA Tracey Kibre in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot; which ran for 2005 to 2006. She starred as Nadine Tolliver on the CBS political drama &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; from 2014 to 2017. She also appeared in recurring roles on &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; (2013–2019), &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2012–2014), &quot;The Good Fight&quot; (2018–2021), and &quot;Julia&quot; (2022–2023). 

In film, she portrayed Nora Shepherd in the original &quot;Jumanji&quot; (1995) and &quot;&quot; (2019). Other film roles include &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), &quot;Green Card&quot; (1990), &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998), &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; (1999), and &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; (2003).

==Early life==
Bebe Neuwirth was born in Newark, New Jersey. Her father, Lee Neuwirth, was a mathematician who taught at Princeton University and also designed an encryption device while working at the Institute for Defense Analyses. Her mother, Sydney Anne Neuwirth, is a painter who also danced as an amateur for the Princeton Regional Ballet Company. She has an older brother, Peter, a mathematician and actuary who graduated from Harvard. She attended Chapin School and Princeton Day School, and Princeton High School. In her youth, Neuwirth rebelled against authority, being placed in custody for smoking marijuana when she was 13.

Neuwirth started taking ballet lessons at the age of five, a year after viewing a production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; with her mother. She desired to be a ballet dancer until her early teens, when she realized how restricted her technique was, as well as the standard of ballet education where she lived. Upon viewing the musical &quot;Pippin&quot; in Manhattan at 13, she changed her future plans from becoming a ballerina to being a Broadway musical dancer. After graduating from Princeton High School in 1976, she attended the Juilliard School for dance and left after only a year, disliking the school for having a &quot;stifling creative environment&quot; and no Broadway-style dance training. Immediately after leaving Juilliard in 1977, she took singing and jazz classes at a New York City-based YWCA, one of them taught by Joan Morton Lucas, who appeared in the film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952) and the original Broadway production of &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot;. She performed with the Princeton Ballet Company in &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, and &quot;Coppélia&quot;, also appearing in community theater musicals.

==Career==
===Theater work===
Studying acting for two years under Suzanne Shepard, Neuwirth made her Broadway debut in the role of Sheila Bryant in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; in 1980. She later appeared in revivals of &quot;Little Me&quot; (1982); &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1986), for which she won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical at the 40th Tony Awards; and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1994).

1996 saw Neuwirth play Velma Kelly in the Broadway revival of &quot;Chicago&quot;. She described the difficulty level of the role as &quot;like performing microsurgery from 8 to 10:20.&quot; That role brought her her greatest stage recognition to date and several awards including a Tony Award, Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Neuwirth would later return to the revival of &quot;Chicago&quot; in 2006, this time as Roxie Hart. In 2014 she returned again, this time playing &quot;Mama&quot; Morton, making her the first person to play three different characters at three separate times during the course of a single Broadway run.

She appeared in the musical revue &quot;Here Lies Jenny&quot; which featured songs by Kurt Weill sung and danced by Neuwirth and a four-person supporting cast, as part of an unspoken ambiguous story in an anonymous seedy bar possibly in Berlin in the 1930s. The show ran from May 7 through October 3, 2004, in the Zipper Theater in New York. &quot;Here Lies Jenny&quot; was also presented by Neuwirth in San Francisco in 2005. In 2009, Neuwirth toured a one-woman cabaret show with pianist Scott Cady. The cabaret included music by Kurt Weill, Stephen Sondheim, Tom Waits, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, John Kander and Fred Ebb amongst others. In 2010, she returned to Broadway to create the role of Morticia Addams in the original production of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; opposite Nathan Lane.

In 2019, Neuwirth returned to the stage with the Philadelphia Theatre Company, appearing in &quot;A Small Fire&quot; at the Suzanne Roberts Theater in Philadelphia. In 2024 she returned to Broadway playing Fräulein Schneider in a revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical at the 77th Tony Awards.

=== Film and television ===
While in Los Angeles waiting to receive a Tony for her appearance in &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; in 1985, Neuwirth auditioned for the role of Dr. Lilith Sternin in the television series &quot;Cheers&quot;. At the time, Neuwirth was not interested in doing television work and her character was initially planned to be in only one episode of the series. However, the writers enjoyed writing her dialogue so much that she was written into more episodes of the show, eventually making her one of the series&#x27; recurring actors.

Neuwirth&#x27;s character Lilith eventually married Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer). From the fourth to the ninth season, Neuwirth portrayed Lilith in a regular recurring role, and she appeared on the show as a main star for both seasons ten and eleven. Like Kelsey Grammer when he started on the show as Frasier, she was not immediately given star billing in the opening credits but in the end credits for seasons eight and nine, appearing in the opening credits with her own portrait in seasons ten and eleven. She auditioned for the role with her arm in a sling, following a fall a week earlier. She won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the role, in 1990 and 1991. The character also made an appearance in the series &quot;Wings&quot; and in twelve episodes of the &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;, which earned her a 1995 Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series at the 47th Primetime Emmy Awards. She left &quot;Cheers&quot; in 1993 to go back to her career in dancing, but would make more television appearances in other shows and commercials.
Neuwirth&#x27;s dip into the film industry began in 1989 with small roles in films such as &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), and &quot;Penny Ante&quot; (1990). In 1990 she started doing supporting roles in films including &quot;Green Card&quot; (1990), &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), and &quot;Malice&quot; (1993), in all of which she received acclaim from critics for her performances. Her first lead role came in 1993, when she played Margaret a married woman attracted to Wesley (Will Patton), one of her neighbors in the psychological thriller comedy film &quot;The Paint Job (&quot;also released as &quot;Painted Heart)&quot;. Her other credits include &quot;Jumanji&quot;, &quot;Summer of Sam&quot;, &quot;Liberty Heights&quot;, &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Tadpole&quot;, &quot;The Associate&quot;, &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot;, &quot;The Big Bounce&quot;, &quot;Le Divorce&quot;, &quot;The Faculty&quot;, and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity&quot;. In 1996, she starred in a pilot for a TV series called &quot;Dear Diary&quot; for ABC which was not picked up. The producers had it edited slightly and put into a single theater for a single weekend in November 1996, and it became one of only two TV pilots to be nominated for an Oscar and, at the 69th Academy Awards, the only one to win.

Other small-screen credits include a guest appearance in the second season of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, a small role on &quot;The Adventures of Pete and Pete&quot; (episode: &quot;The Call&quot;), &quot;Deadline&quot; (2000), &quot;Hack&quot; (2003), &quot;Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury&quot; (2005) as ADA Tracey Kibre, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999) as Nina Laszlo, a modeling agent/suspect, the miniseries &quot;Wild Palms&quot;, and the fourth season &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;First Contact&quot; as Lanel.

Neuwirth appeared as herself in episodes of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot;. In 2009, she co-starred as Ms. Lynn Kraft in the remake of &quot;Fame&quot;. She had a recurring role as Caroline Taylor, the literary editor of Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman), on the HBO series &quot;Bored to Death&quot;. She also had a recurring role on &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

Neuwirth starred as Nadine Tolliver in the 2014 CBS political drama &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;. In October 2017, Neuwirth announced her decision to leave the series after four seasons. No reason was given. She later reprised the role of Nora Shepherd in &quot;&quot; in 2019; the film grossed 800 million dollars worldwide and received positive reviews from critics.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Neuwirth married Paul Dorman. She met him in 1982 after she performed in &quot;Upstairs at O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s&quot;, a revue at O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s restaurant in New York, where he was bartending. The two divorced in 1991. In 2009, she married director, producer and writer Chris Calkins at The Players club in Manhattan, in a ceremony officiated by actor Peter Coyote.

In a 2004 article in the newspaper &quot;J. The Jewish News of Northern California&quot;, Neuwirth was reported as describing herself as Jewisha &quot;plain Jew&quot; with &quot;no training&quot;. In a 2011 interview she said that she was an &quot;atheist&quot; who &quot;believe[d] in unseen and unproved things&quot; such as reincarnation.

Neuwirth has supported and worked for several non-profit charity organizations. Following two hip replacement surgeries, and after hearing stories of other dancers facing hip problems, Neuwirth was moved to establish the Dancers’ Resource program at The Actors Fund, which caters to financial and physical needs unique to professional dancers. Neuwirth currently serves as vice chair on the board of trustees for The Actors Fund. She has also helped Seeds of Peace.

As an animal lover, she has contributed to the Chatham, New York-based horse rescue group Equine Advocates and the annual pet adoption event Broadway Barks. Neuwirth is particularly fond of cats. In the 1990s, she owned one, Frankie, that she named after architect and writer Frank Lloyd Wright. As of August 2016, she had a black cat, Bobby, a long-haired calico cat, Tallulah, and a mixed Siamese cat, Billie.

In her free time, Neuwirth enjoys pottery, which she first did in high school.

<text>The Cross of Lorraine (), known as the Cross of Anjou in the 16th century, is a heraldic two-barred cross, consisting of a vertical line crossed by two shorter horizontal bars. In most renditions, the horizontal bars are &quot;graded&quot; with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen. The &quot;Lorraine&quot; name has come to signify several cross variations, including the Patriarchal cross with its bars near the top. The Cross of Lorraine came to the Duchy of Lorraine via the Kingdom of Hungary in the 15th century. Similar two-barred cross symbols prominently feature in heraldry from Poland, Lithuania and Belarus. Its ultimate origins are from the crozier of an Archbishop. The Cross of Lorraine was used as a symbol of Free France during World War II and was earlier used by French patriots to signify desire to reclaim provinces lost to Germany in the Franco-Prussian War.

== Design ==
The Cross of Lorraine consists of one vertical and two horizontal bars. In most renditions, the horizontal bars are &quot;graded&quot; with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen.

== History ==
The Cross of Lorraine came from the Kingdom of Hungary to the Duchy of Lorraine. In Hungary, Béla III was the first monarch to use the two-barred cross as the symbol of royal power in the late 12th century. He probably adopted it from the Byzantine Empire, according to historian Pál Engel. René II, Duke of Lorraine inherited the two-barred cross as a symbol from his distant ancestors from the House of Anjou of Hungary, which had inherited it as kings of Hungary from the country&#x27;s first ruling dynasty, the Árpáds. René&#x27;s grandfather, René the Good, who used it as his personal sigil, laid claim to four kingdoms, including Hungary. The cross was still known as the &quot;Cross of Anjou&quot; in the . René II placed the symbol on his flag before the Battle of Nancy in January 1477. In the battle, René defeated the army of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who had occupied the Duchy of Lorraine, and regained his duchy. All coins struck for René bore the symbol thereafter.
== Symbol of France ==
The Cross of Lorraine is an emblem of Lorraine in eastern France. Between 1871 and 1918 (and again between 1940 and 1944), the north-eastern quarter of Lorraine (the Moselle department) was annexed to Germany, along with Alsace. During that period the Cross served as a rallying point for French ambitions to recover its lost provinces. This historical significance lent it considerable weight as a symbol of French patriotism. During World War II, &quot;Capitaine de corvette&quot; Thierry d&#x27;Argenlieu suggested the Cross of Lorraine as the symbol of the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle as an answer to the Nazi swastika.

In France, the Cross of Lorraine was the symbol of Free France during World War II, the liberation of France from Nazi Germany and Vichy France along with the allies the United Kingdom and the United States, and Gaullism and includes several variations of a two-barred cross.

The Cross was displayed on the flags of Free French warships, and the fuselages of Free French aircraft. The medal of the Order of Liberation bears the Cross of Lorraine.

De Gaulle himself is memorialised by a high Cross of Lorraine in his home village of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. The Cross of Lorraine was later adopted by Gaullist political groups such as the Rally for the Republic.

=== New World ===
French Jesuit missionaries and settlers to the New World carried the Cross of Lorraine c. 1750–1810. The symbol was said to have helped the missionaries to convert the native peoples they encountered, because the two-armed cross resembled existing local imagery.

== European heraldry ==
The coat of arms of Hungary depicts a double cross, which is often attributed to Byzantine influence as King Béla III of Hungary was raised in the Byzantine Empire in the 12th century, and it was during his rule when the double cross became a symbol of Hungary. Also the &#x27;dual cross&#x27; is the consonant &#x27;gy&#x27; in ancient Hungarian runic writing which reads &quot;egy&quot; (one) when it stands alone mostly, if not always, with &quot;God&quot; meaning.

A golden double cross with equal bars, known as the Cross of Jagiellons, was used by Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Jogaila since his conversion to Christianity in 1386, as a personal insignia and was introduced in the coat of arms of Lithuania. Initially, the lower bar of the cross was longer than the upper, since it originates from the Hungarian type of the double cross. It later became the symbol of Jagiellonian dynasty and is one of the national symbols of Lithuania, featured in the Order of the Cross of Vytis and the badge of the Lithuanian Air Force.

The double-barred cross is one of the national symbols in Belarus, both as the Jagiellon Cross and as the Cross of St. Euphrosyne of Polatsk, an important religious artifact. The symbol is supposed to have Byzantine roots and is used by the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church as a symbol uniting Eastern-Byzantine and Western-Latin church traditions. The Belarusian Cross can be found on the traditional coat of arms of Belarus, the Pahonia.

Silver double cross, on a mountain with three peaks, forms the coat of arms of the Slovak Republic.

== Typography ==

The &quot;Cross of Lorraine&quot; symbol appears in Unicode as . It is not to be confused with .

The cross of Lorraine was previously used in the Sabre, Apollo, and Worldspan global distribution systems (GDS) as a delimiter in various input formats, however, the latest version of the graphical user interface for each system uses a different symbol: Apollo displays it as a plus sign, Worldspan as a number sign, and Sabre as a yen symbol.

== Miscellaneous appearances ==
For its defense of France in World War I, the American 79th Infantry Division was nicknamed the &quot;Cross of Lorraine&quot; Division; its insignia is the cross. The German 79th Infantry Division of World War II used the cross of Lorraine as its insignia because its first attack was in the Lorraine region. The insignia was redesignated effective December 1, 2009, for the 79th US Army Reserve Sustainment Support Command in Los Alamitos, California.
The Lorraine cross is also used by the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division on their distinguished unit insignia.

The cross is used as an emblem by the American Lung Association and related organizations through the world, and as such is familiar from their Christmas seals program. Its use was suggested in 1902 by Paris physician Gilbert Sersiron as a symbol for the &quot;crusade&quot; against tuberculosis.

It is a standard pattern for horse racing colours in the UK.

<doc id="308939" wikidata="Q4693816" url="?curid=308939" title="Agrep">
<text>agrep (approximate grep) is an open-source approximate string matching program, developed by Udi Manber and Sun Wu between 1988 and 1991, for use with the Unix operating system. It was later ported to OS/2, DOS, and Windows.

It selects the best-suited algorithm for the current query from a variety of the known fastest (built-in) string searching algorithms, including Manber and Wu&#x27;s bitap algorithm based on Levenshtein distances.

agrep is also the search engine in the indexer program GLIMPSE. agrep is under a free ISC License.

==Alternative implementations==
A more recent agrep is the command-line tool provided with the TRE regular expression library. TRE agrep is more powerful than Wu-Manber agrep since it allows weights and total costs to be assigned separately to individual groups in the pattern. It can also handle Unicode. Unlike Wu-Manber agrep, TRE agrep is licensed under a 2-clause BSD-like license.

FREJ (Fuzzy Regular Expressions for Java) open-source library provides command-line interface which could be used in the way similar to agrep. Unlike agrep or TRE it could be used for constructing complex substitutions for matched text. However its syntax and matching abilities differs significantly from ones of ordinary regular expressions.

<doc id="308947" wikidata="Q241879" url="?curid=308947" title="Helen Slater">
<text>Helen Rachel Slater (born December 15, 1963) is an American actress and singer-songwriter. She is best known for playing the DC Comics superheroine Supergirl in the 1984 film &quot;Supergirl&quot;, as well as appearing in films such as &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot; (1985), &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (1986), &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; (1987), &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991), &quot;Chantilly Lace&quot; (1993), and &quot;Lassie&quot; (1994). She provided the voice of Talia al Ghul in &quot;&quot;, portrayed Lara-El in &quot;Smallville&quot;, and played Eliza Danvers in the 2015 &quot;Supergirl&quot; TV series.

==Early life==
Slater was born in Bethpage, New York to Alice Joan (née Citrin), a lawyer and nuclear disarmament peace activist based in New York City; and Gerald Slater, a television executive. Her parents divorced in 1974. She is Jewish. She has a brother, David, who is a lawyer in New York City. Slater attended Great Neck South High School and then transferred to the High School of Performing Arts from which she graduated in 1982.

==Career==
===Film and television===
Slater played Supergirl in the 1984 film &quot;Supergirl&quot;. She has starred in several further films including &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot; (1985), &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (1986), &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; (1987), and &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991). She has additionally found work as an actress in television and stage projects. 

Following &quot;Supergirl&quot;, Slater has made multiple appearances in &quot;Superman&quot; media such as Superman&#x27;s mother Lara-El in the TV series &quot;Smallville&quot;, Supergirl&#x27;s adoptive mother Eliza Danvers in the &quot;Supergirl&quot; TV series, and Clark Kent&#x27;s adoptive mother Martha Kent in &quot;DC Super Hero Girls: Hero of the Year&quot; and the associated film. Slater&#x27;s likeness was used to portray Supergirl in a CGI cameo appearance in the film &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023).

In 1985, DC Comics included Slater as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot; for her work on the &quot;Supergirl&quot; film.

===Stage work===

In 1987, Slater co-founded the New York theater group, Naked Angels, with Gina Gershon. In 1991, she also co-founded, with her husband, Robert Watzke, the L.A. based theater group &quot;The Bubalaires&quot;.

Slater appeared in two off-Broadway plays: &quot;Almost Romance&quot; and &quot;Responsible Parties&quot;. She also starred in &quot;The Big Deal&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse.

===Music career===
In 2003, she released the album, &quot;One of These Days,&quot; consisting of her original songs. The tracks were real-time recordings with Slater singing and playing piano, accompanied by six other musicians; no multitracking, editing, or dubbing was employed. In 2005, she released a second album, &quot;Crossword,&quot; which used the same recording approach as her first album. Both albums were produced by Phillip Swann. In 2008, Cortes Alexander recorded Slater&#x27;s &quot;Any Day Now&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;ll Come &amp; Do Just That&quot; on his album &quot;Swell.&quot; Since then, Slater has released four additional albums: &quot;Shine&quot; (2010), &quot;The Myth of Ancient Greece&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; (2015), both made for children and &quot;Selkie&quot; (2019), an eleven-song concept album released as one continuous musical piece.

===Writing===
In 2010, Slater wrote a Supergirl story, &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which appeared in the fiftieth issue of the fifth volume of the &quot;Supergirl&quot; comic book.

<doc id="308955" wikidata="Q3725248" url="?curid=308955" title="Grand unification energy">
<text>The grand unification energy formula_1, or the GUT scale, is the energy level above which, it is believed, the electromagnetic force, weak force, and strong force become equal in strength and unify to one force governed by a simple Lie group. The exact value of the grand unification energy (if grand unification is indeed realized in nature) depends on the precise physics present at shorter distance scales not yet explored by experiments. If one assumes the Desert and supersymmetry, it is at around 1025 eV or formula_2 GeV (≈ 1.6 megajoules). 

Some Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) can predict the grand unification energy but, usually, with large uncertainties due to model dependent details such as the choice of the gauge group, the Higgs sector, the matter content or further free parameters. Furthermore, at the moment it seems fair to state that there is no agreed &quot;minimal GUT&quot;.

The unification of the electroweak force and the strong force with the gravitational force in a so-called &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; requires an even higher energy level which is generally assumed to be close to the Planck scale of formula_3 GeV. In theory, at such short distances, gravity becomes comparable in strength to the other three forces of nature known to date. This statement is modified if there exist additional dimensions of space at intermediate scales. In this case, the strength of gravitational interactions increases faster at smaller distances and the energy scale at which all known forces of nature unify can be considerably lower. This effect is exploited in models of large extra dimensions.

The most powerful collider to date, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is designed to reach about 104 GeV in proton–proton collisions. The scale 1016 GeV is only a few orders of magnitude below the Planck energy of 1019 GeV, and thus not within reach of man-made earth bound colliders.

<doc id="308961" wikidata="Q579564" url="?curid=308961" title="Milice">
<text>The &#x27; (French Militia), generally called &#x27; (; ), was a political paramilitary organization created on 30 January 1943 by the Vichy régime (with German aid) to help fight against the French Resistance during World War II. The Milice&#x27;s formal head was Vichy France&#x27;s Prime Minister Pierre Laval (in office 1942 to 1944), although its chief of operations and &quot;de facto&quot; leader was Secretary General Joseph Darnand. The participated in summary executions and assassinations, helping to round up Jews and in France for deportation. It was the successor to Darnand&#x27;s (SOL) militia (founded in 1941). The was the Vichy régime&#x27;s most extreme manifestation of fascism.
Ultimately, Darnand envisaged the as a fascist single-party political movement for the French State.

 members frequently used torture to extract information or confessions from those whom they interrogated. The French Resistance considered the more dangerous than the Gestapo or SS because its staff were native Frenchmen who understood local dialects fluently, had extensive knowledge of the towns and countryside, and knew local people and informants.

==Membership==
Early Milice volunteers included members of France&#x27;s pre-war far-right parties, such as the Action Française, and working-class men convinced of the benefits of the Vichy government&#x27;s politics. In addition to ideology, incentives for joining the Milice included employment, regular pay and rations, the latter of which became particularly important as the war continued and civilian rations dwindled to near-starvation levels. Some joined because members of their families had been killed or injured in Allied bombing raids or had been threatened, extorted or attacked by French Resistance groups. Still others joined for more mundane reasons: petty criminals were recruited by being told their sentences would be commuted if they joined the organization, and Milice volunteers were exempt from transportation to Germany as forced labour. Official figures are difficult to obtain, but several historians including Julian T. Jackson estimate that the Milice&#x27;s membership reached 25,000–30,000 by 1944. The majority of members were not full-time militiamen, but devoted only a few hours per week to their Milice activities. The Milice had a section for full-time members, the Franc-Garde, who were permanently mobilized and lived in barracks.

The Milice also had youth sections for boys and girls, called the &quot;Avant-Garde&quot;.

== Symbols and materials ==

===Emblem===

The emblem of the Milice, a stylised lower-case Greek letter gamma (γ), a variant of the Aries astrological sign in the zodiac, ostensibly represented rejuvenation
and replenishment of energy. The color-scheme was silver on a blue background within a red circle for ordinary , white on a black background for the full-time armed members (the ) of the , and white on a red background for the active combatants.

=== March ===
Their march was &quot;Le Chant des Cohortes&quot;.

=== Uniform ===

Milice troops (known as &quot;miliciens&quot;) wore a blue uniform jacket and trousers, a brown shirt and a wide blue beret. (During active paramilitary-style operations, an Adrian helmet was used, which commonly featured the emblem, either painted on or as a badge) Its newspaper was &quot;Combats&quot; (not to be confused with the underground Resistance newspaper, &quot;Combat&quot;). The Milice&#x27;s armed forces were officially known as the &quot;Franc-Garde&quot;. Contemporary photographs show the Milice armed with a variety of weapons captured from Allied forces.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
The Resistance targeted individual for assassination, often in public areas such as cafés and streets. On 24 April 1943 they shot and killed Paul de Gassovski, a in Marseille. By late November, &quot;Combat&quot; reported that 25 had been killed and 27 wounded in Resistance attacks.

=== Reprisals ===
The most prominent person killed by the Resistance was Philippe Henriot, the Vichy regime&#x27;s Minister of Information and Propaganda, who was known as &quot;the French Goebbels&quot;. He was killed in his apartment in the Ministry of Information on the rue Solferino in the predawn hours of 28 June 1944 by &quot;résistants&quot; dressed as &quot;miliciens.&quot; His wife, who was in the same room, was spared. The Milice retaliated for this by killing several well-known anti-Nazi politicians and intellectuals (such as Victor Basch) and prewar conservative leader Georges Mandel.

The Milice initially operated in the former &quot;Zone libre&quot; of France under the control of the Vichy regime. In January 1944, the radicalized Milice moved into what had been the &quot;zone occupée&quot; of France (including Paris). They established their headquarters in the old Communist Party headquarters at 44 rue Le Peletier and at 61 rue Monceau. (The house was formerly owned by the Menier family, makers of France&#x27;s best-known chocolates.) The Lycée Louis-Le-Grand was occupied as a barracks, and an officer candidate school was established in the Auteuil synagogue.

=== Notable actions ===
Perhaps the largest and best-known operation undertaken by the Milice was the Battle of Glières, its attempt in March 1944 to suppress the Resistance in the &quot;département&quot; of Haute-Savoie (in southeastern France, near the Swiss border). The Milice could not overcome the Resistance, and called in German troops to complete the operation. On Bastille Day, 14 July 1944, the Franc-Garde suppressed a revolt started by prisoners at Paris prison La Santé, killing 34 prisoners.

The legal standing of the Milice was never clarified by the Vichy government; it operated parallel to (but separate from) the Groupe mobile de réserve and other Vichy French police forces. The Milice operated outside civilian law, and its actions were not subject to judicial review or control.

=== End of the war in Europe ===
In August 1944, as the tide of war was shifting and fearing he would be held accountable for the operations of the Milice, Marshal Philippe Pétain sought to distance himself from the organization by writing a harsh letter rebuking Darnand for the organization&#x27;s &quot;excesses.&quot; Darnand&#x27;s response suggested that Pétain ought to have voiced his objections sooner.

After the Allied Liberation of France, French collaborators began fleeing the Allied advance in the west. During a period of unofficial reprisals immediately following on the German retreat, large numbers of &quot;miliciens&quot; were executed, either individually or in groups. Milice offices throughout France were ransacked, with agents often being brutally beaten and then thrown from office windows or into rivers before being taken to prison. At Le Grand-Bornand, French Forces of the Interior executed 76 captured members of the Milice on 24 August 1944.

Those Frenchmen who managed to escape to Germany and were serving in the German Navy, the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), the Organisation Todt and the Milice security police became part of a new unit known as the Waffen Grenadier Brigade of the SS Charlemagne (&quot;Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS Charlemagne&quot;). The unit also included some remaining personnel from the disbanded Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (LVF) and the SS-Volunteer &quot;Sturmbrigade&quot; France (SS-Freiwilligen Sturmbrigade &quot;Frankreich&quot;). Later in February 1945, the unit was renamed the Charlemagne Division of the Waffen-SS. At this time it had a strength of 7,340 men: 1,200 men from the LVF, 1,000 from the &quot;Sturmbrigade&quot;, 2,500 from the Milice, 2,000 from the NSKK, and 640 who were former &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and naval police. Some of its surviving members were among the last defenders of Hitler&#x27;s bunker, fighting suicidally to the end in the ruins of Berlin.

=== Aftermath ===
An unknown number of &quot;miliciens&quot; managed to escape prison or execution, either by going underground or fleeing abroad. A few were later prosecuted. The most notable of these was Paul Touvier, the former commander of the Milice in Lyon. In 1994, he was convicted of ordering the retaliatory execution of seven Jews at Rillieux-la-Pape. He died in prison two years later.

==In popular culture==
*Since the war, the term &quot;milice&quot; has acquired a derogatory meaning in France.
*The French hard rock ensemble Trust had a hit named &quot;Police Milice&quot;, where its frontman Bernard Bonvoisin compared modern-day police officers to the Milice. 
*Louis Malle&#x27;s films &quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot; and &quot;Au revoir les enfants&quot; include the Milice as part of the plot.
*The 2003 drama &quot;The Statement&quot;, directed by Norman Jewison and starring Michael Caine, was adapted from the 1996 novel by the same name by Brian Moore. He shaped it from the story of Paul Touvier, a Vichy French Milice official who hid for years (often sheltered by the Catholic Church) and was indicted in 1991 for war crimes. Both he and the film character had supervised a mass murder of Jews.
* The film &quot;Female Agents&quot; (), set during World War II, has a scene where two of the female agents walk past a recruitment poster for the Milice which says &quot;Against Communism / French Militia / Secretary-General Joseph Darnand&quot;.
*In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio story &quot;Resistance&quot;, the Doctor and Polly have to evade the Milice in 1944.
*They feature prominently in the popular French TV series &quot;Un Village Français&quot; which covers the whole period of the occupation and liberation and was broadcast in France and extensively internationally.
*They are enemies in &quot;Medal of Honor: Underground&quot;.
*The Catholic priest Father Fehily from the Ross O&#x27;Carroll-Kelly series of novels is revealed to have served in the Milice as a young man, in the novel &quot;Should Have Got Off at Sydney Parade&quot; (2007).
