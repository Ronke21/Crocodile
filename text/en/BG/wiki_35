<text>Frederick William Faber (28 June 1814 – 26 September 1863) was a noted English hymnwriter and theologian, who converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism in 1845. He was ordained to the Catholic priesthood subsequently in 1847. His best-known work is the hymn &quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot;.

==Early life==

Faber was born on 28 June 1814 at Calverley, then within the Parish of Calverley in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where his grandfather, Thomas Faber, was the vicar. His uncle, the theologian George Stanley Faber, had been a prolific author.

Faber attended grammar school at Bishop Auckland in County Durham for a short time, but a large portion of his boyhood was spent in Westmorland. He afterwards attended Harrow and Shrewsbury, followed by enrollment in 1832 at Balliol College at the University of Oxford. In 1834, he obtained a scholarship at University College, from which he graduated with second-class honours in Literae Humaniores in 1836. In the same year he won the Newdigate Prize for a poem on &quot;The Knights of St John&quot;, which elicited special praise from John Keble. Among his college friends were Arthur Penrhyn Stanley and Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne. After graduation, he was elected a fellow of the college.

Faber&#x27;s family was of Huguenot descent, and Calvinist beliefs were strongly held by them. When Faber had come to Oxford, he was exposed to the Anglo-Catholic preaching of the Oxford Movement which was beginning to develop in the Church of England. One of its most prominent proponents was the popular preacher John Henry Newman, vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin. Faber struggled with these divergent forms of Christian beliefs and life. In order to relieve his tension, he would take long vacations in the Lake District, where he would write poetry. There he was befriended by another poet, William Wordsworth. He finally abandoned the Calvinistic views of his youth and became an enthusiastic follower of Newman. In 1837 Faber met George Smythe, with whom he formed an intense bond. Several scholars have noted homoerotic tendencies in Faber&#x27;s writings about this and other same-sex relationships.

==Anglican ministry==
Faber was ordained in the Church of England in 1839, after which he spent time supporting himself as a tutor.

In 1843, Faber accepted the position of rector at a church in Elton, then in Huntingdonshire but now in Cambridgeshire. His first act was to go to Rome to learn how best to carry out his pastoral charge. Faber introduced the Catholic practices of celebrating feast days, confession and the devotion of the Sacred Heart to the congregation. However, there was a strong Methodist presence in the parish and the Dissidents packed his church each Sunday in an attempt to challenge the High Church direction in which he was taking the congregation.

==Roman Catholic ministry==
Few people were surprised though when, after a prolonged mental struggle, Faber left Elton to follow his hero Newman and join the Catholic Church, into which he was received in November 1845 by Bishop William Wareing of Northampton. He was accompanied in this step by eleven men from the small community which had formed around him in Elton. They settled in Birmingham, where they informally organized themselves in a religious community, calling themselves the Brothers of the Will of God.

Faber and his small religious community were encouraged in their venture by the Earl of Shrewsbury, who gave them the use of Cotton Hall in Staffordshire. Within weeks they had begun construction on a new Church of St. Wilfrid, their patron saint, designed by the noted church architect, Pugin, as well as on a school for the local children. All of this was for a region which had no other Catholics at that point, other than the household of the earl. The exertions took their toll on Faber, who became so ill that he was not expected to live and was given the last rites of the church. He recovered, however, and was ordained a Catholic priest, celebrating his First Mass on 4 April 1847. In the course of his illness, Faber had developed a strong devotion to the Blessed Mother. Prompted by this devotion, he translated Louis de Montfort&#x27;s classic work, &quot;True Devotion to Mary&quot;, into English.

===The Oratory===
Along with Newman, Faber felt drawn to the way of life of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, with its decentralized authority and greater freedom of life than in religious institutes.

The Earl of Shrewsbury, who had handsomely financed the construction of a new parish for the community, felt betrayed by such a quick departure. Additionally, the Wilfridians, as the Brothers were called, wished to wear a traditional religious habit, upsetting the old Catholic families who had survived centuries of persecution by keeping a low profile. Newman thus proposed that Faber&#x27;s community settle somewhere other than Birmingham, and suggested London as the best option. Thus in 1849, a community of the Oratory was established in London in William IV Street.

On 11 October 1850, the feast of St. Wilfrid, the community in London was established as autonomous, and Faber was elected its first provost, an office he held until his death. He took ill again, however, almost immediately, and was ordered by his physicians to travel to a warmer climate. He attempted a trip to the Holy Land but had to turn back, and instead toured Malta and Italy. The community still lacked a permanent home, and in September 1852 a location was chosen at Brompton. The Oratorians proceeded with construction despite public protests at their presence.

==Last years==
Faber had never enjoyed good health. He had suffered from illness for years, developing what was eventually diagnosed as Bright&#x27;s disease, which was to prove fatal. In spite of his weak health, much work was crowded into those years. He published a number of theological works, and edited the &quot;Oratorian Lives of the Saints&quot;.

Faber died on 26 September 1863. His funeral was on 30 September and he was buried in the cemetery of St Mary&#x27;s Sydenham (then in Kent), which was the Brompton Oratory&#x27;s retreat house. In 1952 Faber&#x27;s remains were re-interred in the Brompton Oratory London, when St Mary&#x27;s was requisitioned by the London County Council. Elizabeth Bowden had given St Wilfrid&#x27;s chapel at the Oratory, in memory of Faber, as in life he had a great devotion to St Wilfrid. He took the name of the saint when he entered the Oratory and chose St Wilfrid&#x27;s feast for the formal foundation of the London house. His remains were laid in a vault in front of the altar and a marble slab and inscription cover the vault.

Faber was the great-uncle of Geoffrey Faber, co-founder of the publishing house &quot;Faber and Gwyer&quot; which later became &quot;Faber and Faber&quot;, a major publisher of both literary and religious works.

Faber published hymnals titled &#x27;Jesus and Mary&#x27; (1849) which contained considerable deep insights into Marian theology. As a Catholic writer, Faber countered Protestant ideas of &#x27;automatic&#x27; salvation of the Christian by Christ&#x27;s death (as evidenced by &#x27;O Turn to Jesus, Mother turn&#x27;) and the idea of Mary as being a mere character in the Christian story (as evidenced by &#x27;Mother of Mercy, Day by Day&#x27;).

==Hymns==

Among Faber&#x27;s best-known hymns are:
* &quot;Dear Angel, ever at my side, how loving must Thou be&quot; A hymn to the Guardian Angel
* &quot;Dear Guardian of Mary&quot;
* &quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot; This hymn originally had two versions, English and Irish, but is more commonly sung to the English with a slight alteration
* &quot;Hail, Holy Joseph, Hail&quot; One of the most popular hymns to Saint Joseph
* &quot;Have mercy on us God most High&quot; A hymn to the Holy Trinity. Most famously set to the same air as &#x27;The Star of the County Down&#x27;
* &quot;I was wandering and weary&quot;
* &quot;Jesus gentlest Saviour, God of Might and Power&quot; A hymn for Holy Communion
* &quot;Jesus is God, the glorious bands&quot; (n. 298, The Church Hymn Book (1872)), written in 1862
* &quot;Jesus my Lord, my God, my all!&quot; A hymn for thanksgiving after Holy Communion
* &quot;Like the Dawning of the Morning&quot; Advent carol which describes the joy of Mary&#x27;s expectation of the Infant Jesus
* &quot;Mother of Mercy, Day by Day&quot; (1849) A Marian hymn on the importance of Marian devotion
* &quot;My God, how wonderful thou art&quot; (1849) A hymn to the Eternal Father

* &quot;O paradise! O paradise&quot; (1849)
* &quot;O Purest of Creatures, Sweet Mother, Sweet Maid&quot; A hymn to Mary, Star of the Sea. Translated into the Scottish Gaelic language, where it is sung to the same melody, by iconic poet Fr. Allan MacDonald (1859-1905) of Eriskay.
* &quot;Oh, come and mourn with me awhile&quot;(1849) A Passiontide hymn with emphasis on Mary
* &quot;O turn to Jesus, Mother turn&quot; A hymn calling on Mary for the aid of the Holy Souls in Purgatory
* &quot;Oh, gift of gifts&quot; (1848)
* &quot;Sweet Saviour, bless us ere we go&quot;
* &quot;There&#x27;s a Wideness in God&#x27;s Mercy&quot; (also known as &quot;Souls of men, why will ye scatter?&quot;)
* &quot;The Greatness of God&quot;
* &quot;The Will of God/God&#x27;s Holy Will&quot;

Faber was a supporter of congregational singing and wrote his hymns in an age when the English, in general, were slowly moving back to congregational singing after the strictness of low-church Anglicanism. So Faber, as a Catholic, expanded the church&#x27;s hymns that were suitable for congregational singing and encouraged the practice.We must remember that if all the manifestly good men were on one side and all the manifestly bad men on the other, there would be no danger of anyone, least of all the elect, being deceived by lying wonders.  It is the good men, good once, we must hope good still, who are to do the work of Anti-Christ and so sadly to crucify the Lord afresh…. Bear in mind this feature of the last days, that this deceitfulness arises from good men being on the wrong side.

<doc id="312781" wikidata="Q322080" url="?curid=312781" title="Dinu Lipatti">
<text>Constantin &quot;Dinu&quot; Lipatti (; 2 December 1950) was a Romanian classical pianist and composer whose career was cut short by his death from effects related to Hodgkin&#x27;s disease at age 33. He was elected posthumously to the Romanian Academy. He composed few works, all of which demonstrated a strong influence from Hungarian composer Béla Bartok.

A relentless perfectionist, Lipatti often prepared many years for major performances, such as four years for Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5 and three for Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1. He left a small number of recordings, and they are well-regarded, particularly that of &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot; from Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Miroirs&quot; suite. In his short lifetime he was highly acclaimed by many musical figures of the 20th century, namely Yehudi Menuhin, Alfred Cortot, Nadia Boulanger, and Francis Poulenc.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Constantin Lipatti (from childhood called by the diminutive &quot;Dinu&quot;) was born in Bucharest into a musical family: his father was a violinist who had studied with Pablo de Sarasate and Carl Flesch, his mother a pianist. For his baptism, which occurred not shortly after birth as is usual, but when he was old enough to play the piano, the violinist and composer George Enescu agreed to be his godfather. Lipatti played a minuet by Mozart at his own baptism.

He studied at the Gheorghe Lazăr High School, while studying piano and composition with Mihail Jora for three years. He then attended the Bucharest Conservatoire, studying under Florica Musicescu, who also taught him privately. In June 1930, the best pupils at the Conservatoire gave a concert at the Bucharest Opera, and the 13-year-old Lipatti received a huge ovation for his performance of the Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor. In 1932 he won prizes for his compositions: a Piano Sonatina, and a Sonatina for Violin and Piano. That year he also won a Grand Prize for his symphonic suite &quot;Les Tziganes&quot;.

===Career===
He entered the 1933 Vienna International Piano Competition and finished second to Polish pianist Bolesław Kon, some say controversially. Alfred Cortot, who thought Lipatti should have won, resigned from the jury in protest. Lipatti subsequently studied in Paris under Cortot, Nadia Boulanger (with whom he recorded some of Brahms&#x27;s Waltzes Op. 39), Paul Dukas (composition) and Charles Munch (conducting). At eighteen, Lipatti gave his recital debut in Paris at the École Normale. On 17 May 1935, three days before the concert, his friend and teacher, Paul Dukas, died and in his memory Lipatti opened his program with J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot; in the transcription by Myra Hess, the first piece he publicly performed as an adult pianist.

Lipatti&#x27;s career was interrupted by World War II. Although he gave concerts across the Nazi-occupied territories, as the war grew closer he fled his native Romania in September 1943 with his companion and fellow pianist, Madeleine Cantacuzene. With the aid of Edwin Fischer he emigrated to Geneva, Switzerland, where he accepted a position as professor of piano at the Geneva Conservatory. His pupils at the conservatory included Charles Reiner and Béla Síki.

It was while teaching at the Geneva Conservatory in the 1940s that the first signs of Lipatti&#x27;s illness emerged. At first, doctors were baffled, and in 1947 he was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. He and Madeleine married in 1948 as Lipatti&#x27;s health continued to decline. As a result, his public performances became considerably less frequent after the war. His energy level was improved for a time by then experimental injections of cortisone and his collaboration with record producer Walter Legge between 1947 and 1950 resulted in the majority of the recordings of Lipatti&#x27;s playing.

===Later years and death===

Lipatti gave his final recital, also recorded, on 16 September 1950 at the Besançon Festival in France. Despite severe illness and a high fever, he gave superb performances of Bach&#x27;s Partita No. 1 in B-flat major, Mozart&#x27;s A minor Sonata, K. 310, Schubert&#x27;s G-flat major and E-flat major Impromptus, Op. 90, and thirteen of the fourteen Chopin Waltzes which he played in his own integral order. Coming to the last one, No. 2 in A-flat, he found he was too exhausted to play it and he offered instead &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot;, the piece with which he had begun his professional career only fifteen years before. He died less than 3 months later in Geneva aged 33, from a burst abscess on his one lung. Lipatti is buried at the cemetery of Chêne-Bourg next to his wife Madeleine (1908–1982), a noted piano teacher.

==Repertoire==
Lipatti&#x27;s piano playing is widely appreciated for the absolute purity of his interpretations, at the service of which he used a masterful pianistic technique. Lipatti is particularly noted for his interpretations of Chopin, Mozart and Bach, and he also made recordings of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Alborada del Gracioso&quot;, Liszt, Enescu, and the Schumann and Grieg piano concertos. His recording of Chopin&#x27;s Waltzes has remained in print since its release and has long been a favorite of many classical music-lovers.

Lipatti never recorded any of Beethoven&#x27;s music. It is a common misconception, however, that Lipatti did not perform Beethoven&#x27;s music until late in his career. The &quot;Waldstein&quot; Sonata had been a feature of Lipatti&#x27;s repertoire since 1935. He also performed the &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto in Bucharest twice during the 1940–41 season, and even stood ready to record it for EMI in 1949. An internal memo from Lipatti&#x27;s recording producer Walter Legge, dated 23 February 1948, states that &quot;Lipatti ha[d] his heart set on doing a Beethoven Concerto in 1949&quot; and nominates the &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto, given that Lipatti had already performed it.

A recording of Chopin&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in E minor, originally released under Lipatti&#x27;s name, and said to have been a recording of a live performance in Switzerland in May 1948, proved not to be his contribution at all. In 1981, it emerged that the soloist on this recording was in fact a Polish pianist (and a fellow Cortot pupil), Halina Czerny-Stefańska, the joint winner of the 4th International Chopin Piano Competition, playing with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra under Václav Smetáček. However, later on, an authentic recording by Lipatti of the Chopin Concerto was found.

Harold C. Schonberg wrote in 1953 &quot;Lipatti, a master of the keyboard, would have developed into one of the supreme artists of this era. He was a pianist of the Rachmaninoff order, blessed with an enormous technique and a strong rhythmic sense.&quot;

==Legacy==

In recognition of his outstanding contributions to classical music interpretation and composition he was posthumously elected in 1997 as a member of the Romanian Academy. In 2005, The Mountain Goats released a song in his honor, titled &quot;Dinu Lipatti&#x27;s Bones&quot;. In 2017 Lipatti admirer Orlando Murrin discovered the only known film footage of Lipatti, at a Lucerne garden party in 1947 with Paul Hindemith and other musicians, which was screened at London&#x27;s Cadogan Hall that November.

 Lupatti&#x27;s home at Bulevardul Lascăr Catargiu 10 is part of the Municipal Museum of Bucharest. The municipality named it Casa Artelor Dinu Lipatti in 2017 with a mandate as a cultural center, but later became part of the Municipal Museum under the name Casa Memorială Dinu Lipatti.

<text>John Richard Lill (born 17 March 1944 in London) is a British classical pianist.

==Biography==
Lill studied at the Royal College of Music with Angus Morrison, and with Wilhelm Kempff. His talent emerged at an early age, he gave his first piano recital at the age of nine and by the age of 14 had all of the Piano Sonatas of Beethoven committed to memory. At age 18, he performed Rachmaninoff&#x27;s 3rd Piano Concerto under Sir Adrian Boult followed then by a much-acclaimed 1963 London debut playing Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5 at the Royal Festival Hall. In 1970 he won the Moscow International Tchaikovsky Competition (ex-aequo with Vladimir Krainev). It was said by Sidney Harrison that &quot;he (John Lill) simply devours Beethoven. I set him work for the week – he does that and more.&quot;

Lill has made a number of recordings, including the complete piano concertos of Beethoven, Brahms and Rachmaninoff and the complete piano sonatas of Beethoven and Prokofiev.

Lill has performed in over fifty countries, both as a recitalist and as a concerto soloist. He has worked in the major European concert cities, including Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, Prague, Rome, Stockholm and Vienna, as well as in Russia, the Far East and Australasia (including several Australian Broadcasting Corporation tours). He has also performed in the United States with the Symphony Orchestras of Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Seattle, Baltimore, Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Diego.

His repertoire includes more than seventy concertos, and he is acclaimed in particular as a leading interpreter of Beethoven, whose complete sonata cycle he has performed on several occasions in the UK, US and Japan. In Britain, he has given over 30 BBC Promenade concerts and regularly appears with all the major symphony orchestras. He has toured overseas with the London Symphony, London Philharmonic, BBC Symphony, CBSO, Hallé, Royal Scottish National and BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestras.

Lill has recorded for Deutsche Grammophon, EMI (Complete Beethoven Piano Concertos with RSNO and Alexander Gibson), ASV (both Brahms Concertos with the Hallé and James Loughran), Tchaikovsky l with the LSO and James Judd, plus the complete Beethoven Sonatas. More recently, he has recorded the complete Prokofiev sonatas with ASV and his recording of the complete Beethoven Bagatelles and Piano Concertos with the CBSO and Walter Weller is available on Chandos. He recorded Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy on a Theme of John Field&quot; (dedicated to John Lill) with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Vernon Handley for Conifer. He has also recorded the complete Rachmaninoff concertos and major solo piano works for Nimbus Records. His most recent recording projects have been the 60th birthday release of piano works by Schumann on the Classics for Pleasure label and new releases for Signum records of Schumann, Brahms and Haydn.

In 2000, Lill suffered injuries to both his hands when muggers slashed his hands in the course of a robbery attempt. He recovered quickly and resumed his career.

John Lill lives in London. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1978 and appointed a CBE for his services to music in the 2005 New Year&#x27;s Honours List.

<text>Ian Stuart Donaldson (11 August 1957 – 24 September 1993), more commonly known as Ian Stuart, was an English neo-Nazi musician. He was best known as the front-man of Skrewdriver, originally a punk band which, from 1983 onwards, he rebranded as a Rock Against Communism white power skinhead band. He raised money through white power concerts with his Blood &amp; Honour network.

==Biography==
Born in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, Donaldson attended Baines School in nearby Poulton, where he met Sean McKay, Phil Walmsley, and John Grinton. They formed the cover band Tumbling Dice, who played songs by the Rolling Stones and other bands. In 1975, they formed Skrewdriver, a band that gained a reputation for attracting violence at their concerts.

After the original Skrewdriver lineup disbanded in 1979, Donaldson formed a new lineup and began to write songs for a white power audience. The new version of Skrewdriver openly promoted far-right groups such as the National Front and raised funds for them (and affiliated organisations) through the National Front&#x27;s music label, White Noise Records. Skrewdriver became known for its involvement in the White Nationalist movement and its associated music genre, Rock Against Communism. In 1987, Donaldson and Skrewdriver roadie and album-cover artist Nicky Crane founded Blood &amp; Honour, a neo-Nazi network that distributes white power music and organises concerts. Donaldson and Crane cited financial mismanagement by the National Front as reason for creating the network, in addition to claims the National Front had become insufficiently racist, since some National Front members had attempted to appeal to a more mainstream audience to improve declining membership rates.

Donaldson also became leader of two other bands—The Klansmen (a rockabilly band) and White Diamond (a hard rock/heavy metal band)—and released several solo albums. Along with Skrewdriver guitarist Stigger (Stephen Calladine), he recorded the albums &quot;Patriotic Ballads&quot; volumes 1 and 2, which included covers of folk songs such as &quot;The Green Fields of France&quot;. Donaldson&#x27;s voice also appeared in the song &quot;The Invisible Empire&quot;.

On the night of 23 September 1993, Donaldson was involved in a car crash in Derbyshire that resulted in his death the following day, at the age of 36.

<doc id="312785" wikidata="Q159946" url="?curid=312785" title="Wilhelm Kempff">
<text>Wilhelm Walter Friedrich Kempff (25 November 1895 – 23 May 1991) was a German pianist, teacher and composer. Although his repertoire included Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt and Brahms, Kempff was particularly well known for his interpretations of the music of Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert, recording the complete sonatas of both composers. He is considered to have been one of the chief exponents of the Germanic tradition during the 20th century and one of the greatest pianists of all time.

==Early life==
Kempff was born in Jüterbog, Brandenburg, in 1895. He grew up in nearby Potsdam where his father was a royal music director and organist at St. Nicolai Church. His grandfather was also an organist and his brother Georg became director of church music at the University of Erlangen. Kempff studied music at first at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik at the age of nine after receiving lessons from his father at a younger age. Whilst there he studied composition with Robert Kahn and piano with Karl Heinrich Barth (with whom Arthur Rubinstein also studied). In 1914 Kempff moved on to study at the Viktoria gymnasium in Potsdam before returning to Berlin to finish his training.

==As a pianist==
In 1917, Kempff gave his first major recital, consisting of predominantly major works, including Beethoven&#x27;s Hammerklavier Sonata and Brahms Variations on a Theme of Paganini. Kempff toured widely in Europe and much of the rest of the world. Between 1936 and 1979 he performed ten times in Japan (a small Japanese island was named &quot;Kenpu-san&quot; in his honor). Kempff made his first London appearance in 1951 and his first in New York in 1964. He gave his last public performance in Paris in 1981, and then retired for health reasons (Parkinson&#x27;s disease). He died in Positano, Italy, in 1991 at the age of 95, five years after his wife, whom he had married in 1926.

Kempff recorded over some sixty years. His recorded legacy includes works of Schumann, Brahms, Schubert, Mozart, Bach, Liszt, Chopin and particularly of Beethoven.
He recorded the complete sonatas of Franz Schubert long before these works became popular, albeit restricting himself to the finished movements, not fragments, in sonatas that Schubert left incomplete. He also recorded two sets of the complete Beethoven sonatas, one in mono (1951–1956) and the other in stereo (1964–1965); earlier, he recorded nearly all on shellac (1926–1945). He recorded the complete Beethoven piano concertos twice as well, both with the Berlin Philharmonic; the first from the early 1950s in mono with Paul van Kempen, and the later in stereo from the early 1960s with Ferdinand Leitner. Kempff also recorded chamber music with Yehudi Menuhin, Pierre Fournier, Wolfgang Schneiderhan, Paul Grümmer, and Henryk Szeryng, among others.

He left recordings of most of his repertory, including the complete sonatas of Beethoven and Schubert. He performed to an advanced age, continuing to give concerts past his eightieth birthday. His association with the Berlin Philharmonic spanned over sixty years.

===Technique and style===
As a performer Kempff stressed lyricism and spontaneity in music, particularly effective in intimate pieces or passages. He always strove for a singing, lyrical quality. He avoided extreme tempos and display for its own sake.

In his book &quot;The Veil of Order&quot;, the pianist Alfred Brendel wrote that Kempff &quot;played on impulse... it depended on whether the right breeze, as with an aeolian harp, was blowing. You then would take something home that you never heard elsewhere.&quot; He regards Kempff as the &quot;most rhythmical&quot; of his colleagues. Brendel helped choose the selections for the Philips label&#x27;s &quot;Great Pianists of the 20th Century&quot; issue of Kempff recordings, and wrote in the notes that Kempff &quot;achieves things that are beyond him&quot; in his &quot;unsurpassable&quot; recording of Liszt&#x27;s first Legende, &quot;St. Francis Preaching to the Birds.&quot;

When pianist Artur Schnabel undertook his pioneering complete recording of the Beethoven sonatas in the 1930s, he told EMI that if he didn&#x27;t complete the cycle, they should have Kempff complete the remainder. Later, when Kempff was in Finland, the composer Jean Sibelius asked him to play the slow movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 29th Sonata, the Hammerklavier; after Kempff finished, Sibelius told him, &quot;You did not play that as a pianist but rather as a human being.&quot;

==As a teacher==
From 1924 to 1929, Kempff took over the direction of the Stuttgart College of Music as a successor of Max Pauer. In 1931, he was co-founder of the summer courses at Marmorpalais Potsdam. In 1957, Kempff founded Fondazione Orfeo (today: Kempff Kulturstiftung) in the south-Italian city Positano and held his first Beethoven interpretation masterclass at Casa Orfeo, which Kempff had built especially for this reason. He continued teaching there once a year until 1982. His wife died in 1986.

Other noted pianists to have studied with Kempff include Jörg Demus, Norman Shetler, Mitsuko Uchida, Maria João Pires, Peter Schmalfuss, İdil Biret and Ventsislav Yankov.

==As a composer==
A lesser-known activity of Kempff was composing. He composed for almost every genre and used his own cadenzas for Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concertos 1–4. His student İdil Biret has recorded a CD of his piano works. His second symphony premiered in 1929 at the Leipzig Gewandhaus by Wilhelm Furtwängler. He also prepared a number of Bach transcriptions, including the Siciliano from the Flute Sonata in E-flat major, that have been recorded by Kempff and others. His opera &quot;Famile Gozzi&quot;, a comic work in three acts, was written in 1934.

<text>Dame Julia Myra Hess, (25 February 1890 – 25 November 1965) was an English pianist best known for her performances of the works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, and Brahms. She never married but devoted her life to music.

==Career==
=== Early life ===
Julia Myra Hess was born on 25 February 1890 to a Jewish family in South Hampstead, London. Her paternal grandfather had immigrated from Alsace. She was the youngest of four children and began piano lessons at the age of five. She studied at the Guildhall School of Music and at the Royal Academy of Music under Tobias Matthay, after winning a scholarship to the latter in 1903 at age 12.

Hess&#x27; debut came in 1907 when she played Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4 with Thomas Beecham conducting. She went on to tour through Britain, the Netherlands and France, with the violinist Aldo Antonietti, with whom she had a love affair. In 1912 she performed with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Willem Mengelberg. 

During World War I large-scale musical activity ceased in Britain and Europe.

After her American debut in New York City on 24 January 1922, Hess became a favourite in the United States, as both a soloist and ensemble player.

=== Second World War ===
Hess garnered greater fame during the Second World War when, with all concert halls blacked out at night to avoid being targeted by German bombers, she organised almost 2,000 lunchtime concerts, starting shortly after the war began and continuing even through The Blitz. The concerts were held at the National Gallery, in Trafalgar Square. Hess began her lunchtime concerts a few weeks after the start of the war. They were presented on Monday to Friday, for six-and-a-half years without fail. If the Gallery building in central London was being bombed, the concert was occasionally relocated before returning. Promising young performers (such as Eiluned Davies, who gave the UK premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Sonata, Op. 12 at the Gallery on 31 May 1943) were given the opportunity to appear in the concerts alongside established musicians, initially for no fee but after a while all the performers received a standard &#x27;expense fee&#x27; of five guineas, no matter who they were, with the exception of Hess herself, who never took a fee for her appearances in the series.

In all, Hess presented 1,698 concerts seen by 824,152 people; she personally played in 150 of them. She made a brief appearance performing at one of her lunchtime concerts in the 1942 wartime documentary &quot;Listen to Britain&quot; (directed by Humphrey Jennings and Stewart McAllister), a performance enjoyed by the Queen in the audience.

For this contribution to maintaining the morale of the populace of London, King George VI created her a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1941. (She had previously been created a CBE in 1936.) Hess&#x27;s lunchtime concerts influenced the formation of the City Music Society, according to the organisation&#x27;s website.

=== Post-war career ===
In 1946, Arturo Toscanini invited Hess to perform with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in New York City. According to Toscanini&#x27;s biographer Mortimer Frank, after Hess and the conductor had failed to agree on tempos for Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Piano Concerto, they decided instead to perform Beethoven&#x27;s Third. The 24 November 1946 broadcast concert was preserved on transcription discs and later issued on CD by Naxos Records.

Hess performed the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in February 1951, with the solo cello performed by Leonard Rose.

At the Prades Festival in 1952 Hess performed the Brahms Piano Trio Op. 87 with violinist Joseph Szigeti and cellist Pablo Casals.

Hess was most renowned for her interpretations of the works of Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, and Brahms, but had a wide repertoire, ranging from Domenico Scarlatti to contemporary works. She gave the premiere of Howard Ferguson&#x27;s Piano Sonata and his Piano Concerto. She also played a good amount of chamber music and performed in a piano duo with Irene Scharrer who was her cousin. Hess promoted public awareness of the piano duet and two-piano works of Schubert.

In 1926 and 1934 Hess arranged, for both solo piano and for two pianos the chorale &quot;Wohl mir, daß ich Jesum habe&quot; from Bach&#x27;s Cantata &quot;Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben&quot; (BWV 147). This is Movement 6 of the cantata; the music is the same for Movement 10, &quot;Jesus bleibet meine Freude&quot;. Each of these movements takes its text from a verse of the hymn &quot;Jesu, meiner Seelen Wonne&quot; by Martin Janus (or Jahn). Her arrangement was published under the title &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot;, which is a rough translation of the name of this hymn, although the line does not itself appear in Bach&#x27;s cantata.


=== Protégés and influence ===
Hess&#x27; protégés included Clive Lythgoe and Richard and John Contiguglia. She also taught Stephen Kovacevich (then known as Stephen Bishop) and Jane Carlson. She also has a link to jazz, having given lessons in the 1920s to Elizabeth Ivey Brubeck, mother of Dave Brubeck. From 1960 to 1961 she taught Yonty Solomon.

Arnold Bax&#x27;s 1915 piano piece &quot;In a Vodka Shop&quot; is dedicated to Hess.

===Last concert and retirement===
In September 1961, Hess played her final public concert at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall. She was forced to retire after suffering a stroke in early 1961 that left her with permanent brain damage. By the end of the summer of that year it became clear that her public playing days were over. She continued to teach a handful of students, notably Stephen Kovacevich, during her last years.

==Death==
On 25 November 1965, Hess died at the age of 75 of a heart attack in her London home. A blue plaque marks her residence at 48 Wildwood Road in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London.

Hess&#x27;s Steinway piano remains at the Bishopsgate Institute and has been renamed &quot;Myra The Steinway&quot; in her honour.

Hess&#x27;s great-nephews included the British composer Nigel Hess, who named his music publishing company Myra Music in her honour, and the Conservative politician and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.

==Chicago Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts==
In 1977, the Chicago Cultural Center began a series of free lunchtime concerts held at its Preston Bradley Hall every Wednesday from 12:15 pm to 1:00 pm, named in Hess&#x27;s honour as the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts. The series is produced by Chicago&#x27;s International Music Foundation, with performances at Seventeenth Church of Christ Scientist in Chicago. Since 1977, the concerts have been broadcast live on radio station WFMT and streamed at WFMT.com.

<doc id="312791" wikidata="Q61028" url="?curid=312791" title="Walter Gieseking">
<text>Walter Wilhelm Gieseking (5 November 1895 – 26 October 1956) was a French-born German pianist and composer. Gieseking was renowned for his subtle touch, pedaling, and dynamic control—particularly in the music of Debussy and Ravel; he made integral recordings of all their published works which were extant during his life. He also recorded most of Mozart&#x27;s solo piano works.

==Career==

Born in Lyon, France, the son of a German doctor and lepidopterist, Gieseking first started playing the piano at age four, without formal instruction. His family traveled frequently and he was privately educated.
From 1911 to early 1916, he studied at the Hanover Conservatory. There his mentor was the director Karl Leimer, with whom he later coauthored a piano method. He made his first appearance as a concert pianist in 1915, but was conscripted in 1916 and spent the remainder of World War I as a regimental bandsman. His first London piano recital took place in 1923, establishing an exceptional and lasting reputation.

During World War II, Gieseking continued to reside in Germany, while continuing to concertize in Europe, and was accused of having collaborated with the Nazi Party. He was criticized for this by Vladimir Horowitz, who, in David Dubal&#x27;s book &quot;Evenings with Horowitz&quot;, called Gieseking a &quot;supporter of the Nazis&quot;, and by Arthur Rubinstein, who recounted in his book &quot;My Many Years&quot; a conversation with Gieseking in which Gieseking said, &quot;I am a committed Nazi. Hitler is saving our country.&quot; Gieseking performed in front of Nazi cultural organizations such as the NS Kulturgemeinde and &quot;expressed a desire to play for the Führer&quot;. Along with a number of other German artists, Gieseking was blacklisted during the initial postwar period, but by January 1947, he had been cleared by the U.S. military government, enabling him to resume his international career, although his U.S. tour scheduled for January 1949 was canceled owing to protests by organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and the American Veterans Committee. There had been other protests (in Australia and Peru, for example), but Giesking&#x27;s 1949 American tour was the only group of concerts actually canceled due to the outcry. He continued to play in many other countries, and in 1953 he finally returned to the U.S. His concert in Carnegie Hall was sold out and well received.

Because of his gifts of a natural technique, perfect pitch, and abnormally acute faculty for memorization, Gieseking mastered unfamiliar repertoire with relatively little practice. From his early instruction in the Leimer method, he usually studied new pieces away from the piano. It became well known to the public, for instance, that he often committed new works to memory while traveling by train, ship or plane. Sometimes, according to Harold C. Schonberg&#x27;s book &quot;The Great Pianists&quot; (1963), he could even learn an entire concerto by heart in one day.

Gieseking had a very wide repertoire, ranging from various pieces by Bach and the core works by Beethoven to the concertos of Rachmaninoff and more modern works by composers such as Busoni, Hindemith, Schoenberg and the lesser-known Italian Petrassi. He gave the premiere of Hans Pfitzner&#x27;s Piano Concerto in 1923. Today, he is particularly remembered for his recordings of the complete piano works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the two French impressionist masters Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, virtually all of whose solo piano music he recorded on LP for EMI in the early 1950s (the Mozart and Debussy sets have recently been rereleased on CD), after recording much of it for Columbia in the 1930s and 1940s, some of which have also been rereleased on CD.

Gieseking&#x27;s 1944 performance of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto, in which anti-aircraft fire is audible in the background, is one of the earliest stereo recordings, following a rendition of the same work in 1934 for Columbia, with Bruno Walter conducting the Vienna Philharmonic. In December 1955, Gieseking suffered head injuries in a bus accident near Stuttgart, in which his wife was killed.

His last recording project was the complete cycle of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas. Gieseking suddenly fell ill in London while recording Beethoven&#x27;s ”Pastoral” Sonata for HMV. He had completed the first three movements and was to record the finale the next day, but died a few days later of postoperative complications for the relief of pancreatitis. HMV released the unfinished recording, and since then broadcast recordings of Gieseking playing all of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas (except Op. 54, which he never recorded) have been issued. Although some of his performances, particularly live, were marred by wrong notes, Gieseking&#x27;s best performances, as in-studio recording sessions, were virtually flawless.

Parallel to Gieseking&#x27;s work as a performing artist, he was also a composer. During his lifetime his compositions were hardly known, and he made no attempt to publicize them.


Gieseking himself was a lepidopterist, devoting much time to the collecting of butterflies and moths. His private collection can be seen in the Natural History Collection of the Museum Wiesbaden.

<text>Jorge Bolet (November 15, 1914October 16, 1990) was a Cuban-born American concert pianist, conductor and teacher. Among his teachers were Leopold Godowsky, and Moriz Rosenthal – the latter a renowned pupil of Franz Liszt.

==Life==
Bolet was born in Havana and studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he himself taught from 1939 to 1942. His teachers included Leopold Godowsky, Josef Hofmann, David Saperton, Moriz Rosenthal and Fritz Reiner.

In 1937, he won the Naumburg Competition and gave his debut recital. In 1942, Bolet joined the US Army. He was sent to Japan as part of the Army of Occupation. While there, he conducted the Japanese premiere of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. He made his first recordings for the Boston label which published recital recordings in 1952. He recorded the Second Piano Concerto of Sergei Prokofiev with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra on the Remington label. He also recorded the Four Scherzos of Frédéric Chopin on Remington. These recordings were made in the fall of 1953.

Bolet provided the piano soundtrack for the 1960 biopic &quot;Song Without End,&quot; which starred Dirk Bogarde as the legendary 19th-century piano virtuoso Franz Liszt. (The film won the Academy Award for Best Music score.) However, Bolet&#x27;s playing was condemned by American music critics for decades as being too focused on romantic virtuosity, so his recordings in the 1960s were confined to fairly small and hard-to-find labels. Only in 1974 did he come to national prominence, with a stupendous recital in that year at Carnegie Hall, which sealed his reputation.

From 1968 to 1977, Bolet was Professor of Music (piano) at Indiana University, where he taught alongside his childhood friends Abbey Simon and Sidney Foster. In 1977, Bolet became Head of Piano at the Curtis Institute of Music, succeeding Rudolf Serkin, but he resigned from this post to concentrate on his performing career.

In 1984, the A&amp;E Network broadcast a series of three programs, entitled &quot;Bolet Meets Rachmaninoff&quot;, in which the pianist was shown giving masterclasses on the subject of Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3. These masterclasses were followed on the series by a complete performance of Bolet playing the concerto.

The Decca/London record company put him under contract in 1978, giving the 64-year-old Bolet his first systematic exposure to life at a major international label. Recordings of key sections of his repertoire were made from 1978 up to his death, but there are also tapes of many live concerts from this time, which were never commercially released but can be found in archives, principally the International Piano Archives at Maryland. Such performances include a specialty of his, Leopold Godowsky&#x27;s &quot;Concert Paraphrase on Themes from Johann Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;&quot;, which he studied with Godowsky during his student years.

Bolet&#x27;s health began to decline in 1988 and, in 1989, he underwent a brain operation from which he never fully recovered. He died from heart failure in October 1990, at his home in Mountain View, California.

==Recordings==
Bolet is particularly well remembered for his performances and recordings of large-scale Romantic music, particularly works by Franz Liszt, César Franck, and Frédéric Chopin. He also specialised in piano transcriptions and unusual repertoire, including the fiendishly difficult works of Godowsky, many of which Bolet had studied with the composer himself. In an interview given to Elyse Mach (&quot;Great Contemporary Pianists Speak for Themselves&quot;, Dover Books on Music), Bolet extensively mentioned an obscure piece by Joseph Marx which was, according to Bolet&#x27;s own words, his favorite among virtuoso concertos because of the enormous show of strength required from the soloist. His stage manner was one of full concentration to the performance, characterised by minimal body movement.

In 2017–2018, the Audite label issued a series of CDs with broadcast recordings by Bolet from RIAS-Berlin, previously unreleased, mainly from the 1970s. Most of the repertory duplicates his commercial recordings, but the performances exhibit the extra stimulation of an audience.

<text>Sir Clifford Michael Curzon CBE (né Siegenberg; 18 May 19071 September 1982) was an English classical pianist.

Curzon studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, and subsequently with Artur Schnabel in Berlin and Wanda Landowska and Nadia Boulanger in Paris. In his early career he was known for his performances of Romantic and virtuoso music, and for championing modern works. Later he concentrated on composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms. He played regularly in continental Europe and North America, making tours in the 1930s and for most of his post-war career.

Although signed to a recording company, Decca, for most of his career, Curzon was not at ease in the studio, and vetoed the release of many of his recordings, some of which were published after his death.

Curzon was born in Islington, London, the younger son and second of three children of Michael Siegenberg, a Jewish antiques dealer, and his wife Constance Mary, &quot;née&quot; Young. The family name was changed to Curzon in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. The household was musical: Mary Curzon was a talented amateur singer, Michael&#x27;s sister was a professional singer, and his uncle, the composer Albert Ketèlbey was a frequent visitor, and his performances of his music on the family piano were the young Curzon&#x27;s earliest abiding musical memories. The boy&#x27;s first musical studies were as a violinist, but he soon concentrated on the piano.

In 1919 Curzon entered the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London, and two years later was admitted to the senior school of the academy at the unusually early age of fourteen. He studied with Charles Reddie, whose own teacher, Bernhard Stavenhagen, had been a pupil of Franz Liszt. Curzon won many prizes, including the RAM&#x27;s MacFarren Gold Medal, and then continued his studies with Katharine Goodson, who had been a pupil of Theodor Leschetizky. Sir Henry Wood was the conductor of the academy&#x27;s student orchestra, and in 1924 he gave Curzon his first Promenade Concert engagement, as one of the co-soloists in Bach&#x27;s Triple Keyboard Concerto in D minor, along with two other students. At around the time Curzon was graduating, his father became seriously ill, affecting the family business; money became short, and in 1926 Curzon, though not drawn to teaching, accepted a salaried post as a sub-professor at the RAM. One of his pupils at this period was Constance Warren, two years his senior. He continued to pursue a career as a soloist. A family friend introduced him to Sir Thomas Beecham, who was sufficiently impressed by Curzon&#x27;s playing to engage him as soloist in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Coronation&quot; Concerto at the Queen&#x27;s Hall.

In 1928 Curzon temporarily left the RAM. A legacy from the mother of a colleague enabled him to move to Berlin for two years, to study with Artur Schnabel. He then studied with Wanda Landowska and Nadia Boulanger in Paris. Curzon believed that his own pianistic style owed much to the examples of Schnabel and Landowska; although, he said, they disliked each other and were diametrically opposite in their musical aesthetics, he learned about phrasing from Schnabel and about precision of technique from Landowska.

===Soloist===
Curzon built a successful career as a soloist, enabling him to resign from the RAM in 1932. In addition to frequent concerts in Britain, he toured Europe in 1936 and 1938 under the auspices of the British Council, and made his US debut in 1939, returning regularly for many years after the Second World War. In his early years as a star soloist Curzon played a more Romantic and virtuosic repertoire than that associated with him in his later career. Established pianists of the time generally ignored concertante works by such composers as Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Vincent d&#x27;Indy and Frederick Delius, with which Curzon made a mark. He was also known for his espousal of new music, giving premieres and early performances of works by Germaine Tailleferre, John Ireland, Alan Rawsthorne and Lennox Berkeley among others. During the war, shortage of time prevented him from undertaking the British premiere of Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s Piano Concerto, but his friendship with Benjamin Britten led to many joint concerts by the two musicians.

Curzon was a highly self-critical performer, and although he signed for the Decca recording company in 1937 and remained with them throughout his career, he was rarely at ease in the studios, and frequently refused to allow the release of recordings in which he felt dissatisfied with his performance.

After the war Curzon began to limit his appearances in the concert hall and recording studios, devoting himself to extensive periods of private study. Throughout his career he maintained a rigorous regime of practice, playing for several hours every day.

Together with Joseph Szigeti, William Primrose and Pierre Fournier Curzon formed the Edinburgh Festival Piano Quartet in 1952. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Neville Cardus wrote, &quot;They do not quite make an easeful ensemble. The ear is constantly attracted by individual touches of fine musical art, but we receive a sense that each master is playing with his eye on the other, so as not to overstep the bounds of modesty.&quot; As a soloist Curzon made American tours in the years between 1948 and 1970, played at European music festivals and toured the continent with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Sir Malcolm Sargent in 1954.

From the post-war years onwards, Curzon increasingly concentrated on less virtuoso repertoire than hitherto. He became celebrated for his performances of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms. Max Loppert, his biographer in &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, wrote that in the works of these Austro-German classical masters &quot;he was unequalled for sensitivity and directness of manner, beauty of tone and an inner stillness. In such works as Mozart&#x27;s Concerto in B K595, his unique combination of nervous energy and Olympian calm earned him a reputation as a supreme Mozartian.&quot; Another biographer of Curzon, William Mann, wrote: 
Curzon suffered throughout his career from stage fright and, unlike most star pianists, he played not from memory at concerts but with the score on his music stand. In private life, Mann records, Curzon was &quot;an ideal host, a lively raconteur, a keen connoisseur of painting and literature, and appreciative of other countries and their cultures, food, drink and language.&quot;

==Personal life==
While still in Paris, Curzon married the American harpsichordist Lucille Wallace (1898–1977). They had no offspring, but they adopted the two sons of the soprano Maria Cebotari after she and her husband died young.

==Death==
Curzon died in September 1982, aged 75. He is buried next to his wife in the churchyard of St Patrick&#x27;s, Patterdale, near their holiday home in the Lake District. On his gravestone are inscribed the opening words of Franz von Schober&#x27;s poem &quot;An die Musik&quot;: &quot;Du holde Kunst&quot; (O fairest art), familiar from Schubert&#x27;s setting.

==Honours==
In 1958 Curzon was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), and in 1977 he was knighted. He was elected a Fellow of the RAM in 1939, and in 1980 he received the Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s gold medal. He was an honorary fellow of St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford (1981) and was awarded honorary doctorates by the universities of Leeds (1970) and Sussex (1973).

<text>Rishon LeZion ( , &quot;First to Zion&quot;) is a city in Israel, located along the central Israeli coastal plain south of Tel Aviv. It is part of the Gush Dan metropolitan area.

Founded in 1882 by Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire who were part of the First Aliyah, it was the first settlement founded in Israel by the New Yishuv and the second Jewish farm settlement established in Ottoman Syria in the 19th century, after Petah Tikva. As of 2017, it was the fourth-largest city in Israel, with a population of .

The city is a member of Forum 15, which is an association of fiscally autonomous cities in Israel that do not depend on national balancing or development grants.

==Etymology==
The name Rishon LeZion is derived from a verse from the Tanakh: &quot;First to Zion are they, and I shall give herald to Jerusalem&quot; (Isaiah 41:27) and literally translates as &quot;First to Zion&quot;.

==History==
===Ottoman period (1882–1900)===

Rishon LeZion was founded on 31 July 1882, by ten Hovevei Zion pioneers from Kharkiv, Ukraine (then the Russian Empire) headed by Zalman David Levontin. Reuven Yudalevich was also a member of the group. The British vice-consul in Jaffa, Haim Amzaleg, purchased of land southeast of present-day Tel Aviv, the site of watering holes called ‘Uyūn Qārā (literally &#x27;fountain of the crier&#x27;) from Mustafa Abdallah ali Dajan. According to Marom, ‘Uyūn Qārā offered &quot;a convenient launching pad for early land purchase initiatives which shaped the pattern of Jewish settlement until the beginning of the British Mandate&quot;. Amzaleg signed a declaration to the settlers stating that none of the structures on this land would ever be his own.

In addition to the problems posed by sandy soil and lack of water, the newcomers had no agricultural experience. Baron Rothschild brought in experts who drilled for water, finding the groundwater table uneven. Wells were built at a depth of 20–25 meters.

After the Biluim arrived, the town slowly began to develop. On 23 February 1883, the settlers found water in the wells. To mark this occasion, the village emblem was inscribed with a verse from the Torah: &quot;We have found water.&quot; (Genesis 26:32) Fani Belkind, Israel Belkind, Shimshon Belkind, Yoel Drubin, Haim Hissin, and David Yudilovich were among the Biluim who arrived in Rishon Lezion at this time.

In 1883, Itzhak Leib Toporovski a blacksmith of the young village created the first iron plow in the land of Israel, and in 1885 the flag that would later become the flag of Israel was raised for the first time as part of the celebrations of the 3rd anniversary of the village.

When Baron Edmond James de Rothschild took over, sending in his administrators and agricultural guide Shaul Helzner of Mikve Israel, major progress was made in the spheres of agriculture, citrus and viticulture. In November 1883 the first rows were planted, led by ten Russian farmers who were further trained at Mikveh Israel agriculture school, also funded in part by Rothschild. The Great Synagogue, which became a major focus of life in Rishon LeZion, was built between 1885 and 1889. Under Rothschild&#x27;s patronage, the Carmel-Mizrahi Winery was, established in 1886. The Baron Edmond James de Rothschild and his wife Adelheid von Rothschild came to visit the village a year later in 1887.

In 1886, as Rishon LeZion&#x27;s population of around 300 included several dozen children who required proper education, the Haviv elementary school was established in Rishon LeZion as the first modern school to teach exclusively in Hebrew. Dov Lubman Haviv taught there and Mordechai Lubman Haviv was an educational inspector. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, the leading figure in the revival of Hebrew, was a teacher in Rishon LeZion, as was his colleague David Yudilovitz. In 1898, the first Hebrew kindergarten in the world was established by Esther (Shapira) Ginzburg a former student of the Haviv school.

Naphtali Herz Imber, the later famed Hebrew language poet, lived in Rishon LeZion for a few years in the late 1880s. He recited his poem, Tikvahtenu, to eager ears. In 1887, Shmuel Cohen, a young resident of Rishon with a musical background, observed the emotional response of the local Jewish farmers to Imber&#x27;s poem. Using his musical skill, he put the poem to music. Cohen&#x27;s musical composition was an adaptation of a Moldavian/Romanian folk song, &quot;Carul cu Boi&quot; (&quot;The Cart with Oxen&quot;). The catalyst of Cohen&#x27;s musical adaptation facilitated the quick, enthusiastic spread of Imber&#x27;s poem throughout all the Zionist communities of Mandatory Palestine. Within a short few years, it spread globally to pro-Zionist communities and organizations becoming the unofficial Zionist National Anthem.

In 1933, at the 18th Zionist Congress in Prague, the Imber/Cohen Zionist National Anthem, formally adopted, was renamed the Hatikvah (The Hope). In November 2004, the State of Israel formally adopted Shmuel Cohen&#x27;s 1887 musical adaptation to a newly shortened, modified version of Imber&#x27;s poem, creating the modern Israeli National Anthem, the Hatikvah.

In 1888, the medicine house, the baron&#x27;s stables, and the baron&#x27;s clerks house were built. In 1889 the building in which the Carmel-Mizrahi Winery is located was built. A telephone was added to the winery in 1891 and in 1898 electricity was installed. In 1890, a palm boulevard was planted in the location of the future city park. The Rishon LeZion orchestra was established in 1895. In 1898, the year Theodor Herzl visited the settlement, the city park (then the village park) was established and a water tower was built next to the well.
A founder of Rishon LeZion was Joseph Feinberg the father of Dora Bloch.

At the year of its founding in 1882, Rishon LeZion had a population of 150. In 1890, Rishon LeZion had a population of 359. Five years later, the figure had risen to 380, and by 1900, to 526.

===Village council and JCA administration (1900-1922)===
In 1900, the management of the village was transferred from the baron&#x27;s office to the village council and the Jewish Colonization Association. Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, worked in the winery for two months in the summer of 1907.

In 1910, the village bell was constructed next to the medicine house, and in 1912 the first car (&quot;First chariot without horses&quot;) appeared in the village. In 1911, 4,000 dunams of land in Rishon LeZion were planted with grapes and 254 dunams with other fruit orchards.

In 1913, the governor of Greater Syria, Djemal Pasha, annexed the sands around Rishon Lezion to their territory and in 1915 Rishon Lezion was expanded again and was given the territory between it and the Mediterranean Sea. In 1913, Nahlat Yehuda, another Jewish settlement, was established north of Rishon Lezion. In 1915 Rishon Lezion and the surrounding area experienced a Locust attack.

Ayun Kara was the scene of a bloody battle between Turkish and New Zealand troops on 14 November 1917. Local citizens carried the wounded to a medical facility in Rishon LeZion. A stone cenotaph was erected by the people of Rishon LeZion to the memory of the New Zealanders who fell that day, but it has since been destroyed.

In the wake of the battle, the New Zealanders set up camp at Rishon Lezion, which was described by one officer as a &quot;pretty little hamlet surrounded by vineyards and orange groves.&quot; Relations between the troops and villagers were good, and the troops brought the villagers the news of the Balfour Declaration.

In 1919, the women of Rishon Lezion were given voting rights and in the same year, Nehama Pohatchevsky was elected chairman of the village council which marked the first time a woman was elected to the position.
===British Mandate===
In 1924, the British Army contracted the Jaffa Electric Company for wired electric power to the military installations in Sarafand. The contract allowed the Electric Company to extend the grid beyond the original geographical limits that had been projected by the concession it was given. The high-tension line that exceeded the limits of the original concession ran along some major towns and agricultural settlements, offering extended connections to the Jewish settlements of Rishon Le-Zion, Nes-Ziona and Rehovot (despite their proximity to the high-tension line, the Arab towns of Ramleh and Lydda remained unconnected). According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Rishon LeZion had a population of 1,396 inhabitants, consisting of 1,373 Jews and 23 Muslims, increasing in 1931 census to 2,525 inhabitants, in 648 houses.

===State of Israel===
Rishon LeZion was declared a city in 1950, by which time it had a population of around 18,000. By 1983 it had a population of 103,000. In 2006, 222,300 people were living in the city. By 2020, the population is expected to reach 253,600. In 2007, the Rishon LeZion Municipality was awarded the Ministry of Interior Prize for Proper Management.

In 2016, the Israeli government approved the expansion of Rishon LeZion onto sand dunes west of the city, upon which one of the largest commercial and residential construction projects in the Central District will be built on 1,000 dunams. Another industrial zone in the western part of the city is planned to be almost doubled in size.

==Demographics==

The 1922 Census conducted by the British Mandate authorities found 1,373 Jews living in Rishon LeZion and 23 Muslims.

According to data from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics as of December , the number of residents in Rishon LeZion is . Rishon LeZion is one of the fastest-growing cities in Israel, and is the third-youngest city in the country, after Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, with 31.1% of the population being children and teenagers, and 61.4% of all residents being aged 40 or under. In addition, the city has attracted significant immigration, including from English-speaking countries. The city is expected to have a population of around 270,000 by 2030. Its population growth rate is about 5% per year. The majority of the city&#x27;s residents are Jews.

==Economy==

Rishon LeZion&#x27;s main industries today are wine, construction, services and commerce. Factories and workshops are located in the old industrial zone, which has become a popular venue for pubs, dance clubs, and restaurants. Industry in the city is largely divided into two industrial centers: the old industrial zone in the north of the city and the new industrial zone in the west of the city.

The three major malls in Rishon LeZion are &quot;Rothschild Center&quot; in the old downtown center, &quot;Gold Mall&quot; (&quot;Kenyon HaZahav&quot;) in the New West district, and the newly constructed &quot;Azrieli Rishonim&quot;. Companies such as Coca-Cola, Gazit-Globe, Volvo, and Fiat are expected to open in the Maayan Sorek area. As part of the city&#x27;s 5-year plan to be completely water-independent, construction of a desalination plant is planned for Rishon, which will produce 3.7 million cubic meters of water per year. The city already hosts the large Shafdan recycling plant.

The boulevard has a pedestal erected for each laureate. The circular medal on top of the pedestal includes the year of the award in the center of the medal; the name of the laureate, the country, and the prize field are shown in both Hebrew and English. The citation of the Prize is listed on an additional plaque on the side of the pedestal. The scientific advisor of the project was Rishon Lezion resident, Prof. Israel Hanukoglu.

==Neighborhoods==

Rishon LeZion can be divided into four main quarters: the old city, the eastern housing projects, the northern (old) industrial zone, and Western Rishon LeZion. There is also an industrial zone on the southern tip of the city, next to Gan Sorek.

===Old city===
The old city of Rishon includes the original neighborhoods, some buildings dating back to Rishon&#x27;s founding in 1881. This quarter is located in the city center, between and around Herzl and Jabotinsky Streets. It includes the following neighborhoods:

===Shikunei HaMizrah===
The Eastern Housing Projects ( &quot;Shikunei HaMizrah&quot;) was Rishon&#x27;s quick expansion to the east. It is dominated by the housing projects (&quot;shikunim&quot;) there, in the &quot;Shikunei HaMizrah&quot; neighborhood itself. The eastern projects stopped developing when they reached the fences of the Tzrifin military base. When and if Tzrifin is sold to private contractors as planned, this quarter is expected to expand significantly with new lucrative housing projects.

<text>Wilhelm Backhaus (&#x27;Bachaus&#x27; on some record labels) (26 March 1884 – 5 July 1969) was a German pianist and pedagogue. He was particularly well known for his interpretations of Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin and Brahms. He was also much admired as a chamber musician.

==Musical biography==
Born in Leipzig, Backhaus was the son of a well-known architect. He began learning piano at the age of four with his mother, an amateur pianist. The boy&#x27;s talent was soon recognized by Arthur Nikisch, at whose recommendation Backhaus studied under Alois Reckendorf at the Leipzig Conservatory between 1891 and 1899, then took private piano lessons with Eugen d&#x27;Albert in Frankfurt. As a boy of 9 or 10 he was taken to hear both of the Brahms piano concertos performed by d&#x27;Albert — and conducted by Brahms himself.

He made his first concert tour at the age of sixteen. In 1900 he went to England and in 1901 played for the first time in Manchester at the Gentleman&#x27;s Concerts. In 1902 he performed at the Hallé Concerts, and thereafter in 12 concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, and played 6 different piano concertos at the Promenade Concerts. In 1904 he became Professor of Piano at the Royal Manchester College of Music. In 1905 he won the Anton Rubinstein Competition, with Béla Bartók taking second place. He toured widely throughout his life - in 1921 he gave seventeen concerts in Buenos Aires in less than three weeks. Backhaus made his U.S. debut on 5 January 1912 as soloist in Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Piano Concerto (the &quot;Emperor&quot;) with Walter Damrosch and the New York Symphony Orchestra. He taught at the Curtis Institute of Music in 1926. In 1930, he moved to Lugano and became a citizen of Switzerland. He died in Villach in Austria, where he was due to play in a concert. His last recital a few days earlier in Ossiach was recorded.

==Role in Nazi Germany==
Although Backhaus and his wife had become Swiss citizens in 1931, he maintained an active career in Germany. After the seizure of power by the Nazis, Backhaus met Adolf Hitler no later than May 1933, while flying with him to Munich. That same year, he became an executive advisor to the Nazi organization &quot;Kameradschaft der deutschen Künstler&quot; (Fellowship of German Artists). For the show elections of 29 March 1936, Backhaus published a statement in the magazine &quot;Die Musikwoche&quot; under the rubric of &quot;soloist&quot; translated as, &quot;Nobody loves German art, and especially German music, as glowingly as Adolf Hitler…&quot; A month later, on 20 April 1936, Hitler&#x27;s 47th birthday, he gave Backhaus a professorship, and invited him that September to attend the annual Nazi party&#x27;s Nuremberg Rally.

The violinist Leila Doubleday Pirani wrote that in November 1938, she attended a Backhaus concert in London (conducted by Sir Adrian Boult) with the Viennese Jewish violinist Alma Rosé, who told Pirani that Backhaus &quot;was a great friend of the family&quot; and took her backstage to greet the pianist after the concert; but Pirani writes that while &quot;Boult greeted us nicely,&quot; Backhaus, upon seeing Rosé, &quot;turned his back and walked through a passage. Alma&#x27;s face twitched, and of course I realized what a shock this was to her.&quot;; Pirani called the incident &quot;a stab in the back by this cowardly man, who for fear of his Nazi masters could not behave decently, even in London.&quot; The incident is reported by Richard Newman, who writes his &quot;offensive behavior... may have been due to his awareness of German agents operating in London at the time...&quot; Newman also adds that Backhaus moved to Switzerland &quot;in opposition to the Nazi regime&quot;. However, the Backhauses had moved there in 1930 several years before the Nazis came to power.

==Recordings==

Backhaus had a long career on the concert stage and in the recording studio. He recorded the complete piano sonatas and concertos of Beethoven and many works of Mozart and Brahms, and in 1928 he became the first pianist to record the complete Etudes of Frédéric Chopin. Backhaus&#x27; readings are still widely regarded as among the best recordings (Pearl 9902 and others) of those works.
In two groups of sessions in 1932 and 1936, he recorded a series of selected small Brahms piano works, as a connected project for HMV, including a 1936 recording of Brahms&#x27;s Waltzes, Op. 39. His recordings of the complete Beethoven sonatas, made in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, display exceptional technique for a man in his seventies (Decca 433882), as do the two Brahms concertos from about the same time (Decca 433895). His live Beethoven recordings are in some ways even better, freer and more vivid (Orfeo 300921). On the other hand, his playing was sometimes accused of being &quot;mechanical&quot; and &quot;lacking in insight.&quot;

His chamber recordings include Brahms&#x27;s cello sonatas with Pierre Fournier, and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Trout Quintet&quot; with the International Quartet and Claude Hobday.

&quot;The Times&quot; praised Backhaus in its 1969 obituary for having upheld the classical German music tradition of the Leipzig Conservatory. His phenomenal transposing powers spawned many anecdotes: finding the piano a semitone too low at a rehearsal of Grieg&#x27;s A minor Concerto, he simply played it in B-flat minor — and then in the original A minor at the concert after the instrument had been correctly tuned.

Backhaus was quick to recognize the importance of recordings. His drastically abridged 1909 recording of the first and third movements of the Grieg Piano Concerto, lasting about six minutes in total, was not only the first recording of that work, but also the first recording of any concerto. He recorded it complete, and magnificently, in the early 1930s.

At the time of his death, Backhaus had nearly completed his second complete Beethoven sonata cycle. All that was missing was the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; Sonata.

<text>The kitchen deity – also known as the Stove God, named Zao Jun, Zao Shen, Zao kimjah, Cokimjah or Zhang Lang – is the most important of a plethora of Chinese domestic gods that protect the hearth and family. The Kitchen God is recognized in Chinese folk religion, Chinese mythology, and Taoism. He is also celebrated throughout the Sinosphere.

It is believed that on the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunisolar month, just before Chinese New Year, the Kitchen deity returns to Heaven to report the activities of every household over the past year to Yu Huang Da Di (), the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor, emperor of the heavens, either rewards or punishes a family based on Zao Jun&#x27;s yearly report.

==Story==

The Stove God has had many origin stories told about him.

===Zhang Lang===
Though there are many stories on how Zao Jun became the Kitchen God, the most popular one dates back to around the 2nd century BC. Zao Jun was originally a mortal man living on earth whose name was Zhang Lang. He eventually became married to a virtuous woman but ended up falling in love with a younger woman. He left his wife to be with this younger woman and, as punishment for this adulterous act, the heavens afflicted him with ill fortune. He became blind, and his young lover abandoned him, leaving him to resort to begging to support himself.

Once, while begging for alms, he happened to cross the house of his former wife. Being blind, he did not recognize her. Despite his shoddy treatment of her, she took pity on him and invited him in. She cooked him a fabulous meal and tended to him lovingly; he then related his story to her. As he shared his story, Zhang Lang became overwhelmed with self-pity and the pain of his error and began to weep. Upon hearing him apologize, Zhang&#x27;s former wife told him to open his eyes and his vision was restored. Recognizing the wife he had abandoned, Zhang felt such shame that he threw himself into the kitchen hearth, not realizing that it was lit. His former wife attempted to save him, but all she managed to salvage was one of his legs.

The devoted woman then created a shrine to her former husband above the fireplace, which began Zao Jun&#x27;s association with the stove in Chinese homes. To this day, a fire poker is sometimes referred to as &quot;Zhang Lang&#x27;s Leg&quot;.

===Zao Jun===
Alternatively, there is another tale where Zao Jun was a man so poor he was forced to sell his wife. Years later he unwittingly became a servant in the house of her new husband. Taking pity on him she baked him some cakes into which she had hidden money, but he failed to notice this and sold the cakes for a pittance. When he realized what he had done he took his own life in despair. In both stories, Heaven takes pity on Zhang Lang&#x27;s tragic story. Instead of becoming a vampirish hopping corpse, the usual fate of suicides, he was made the god of the Kitchen and was reunited with his wife.

===Other stories===
Another origin story of the Stove God is believed to have appeared soon after the invention of the brick stove. The Kitchen God was originally believed to have resided in the stove and only later took on human form. During the Han dynasty, it is believed that a poor farmer named Yin Zifang, was surprised by the Kitchen God who appeared on Chinese New Year as he was cooking his breakfast. Yin Zifang decided to sacrifice his only yellow sheep. In doing so, he became rich and decided that every winter he would sacrifice one yellow sheep in order to display his deep gratitude.

==Worship and customs==
The Stove God is generally not a god of &quot;the culinary arts&quot;, and his role revolves more around morality and conduct of the family.

Traditionally, every Chinese household would have a paper effigy or a plaque of Zao Jun and his wife (who writes down everything that is said in the household over the year for her husband&#x27;s report to Jade Emperor) above the fireplace in the kitchen. This tradition is still widely practiced, and Zao Jun was the most highly worshiped god of those who protect the household and family. Offerings of food and incense are made to Zao Jun on his birthday (the third day of the eighth lunisolar month) and also on the twenty third day (or twenty fourth day) of the twelfth lunisolar month, which marks his return to Heaven to give his New Year&#x27;s report to the Jade Emperor. On this day, the lips of Zao Jun&#x27;s paper effigy are often smeared with honey to sweeten his words to Yu Huang (Jade Emperor), or to keep his lips stuck together. After this, the effigy will be burnt and replaced by a new one on New Year&#x27;s Day. Firecrackers are often lit as well, to speed him on his way to heaven. If the household has a statue or a nameplate of Zao Jun it will be taken down and cleaned on this day for the new year.

Many customs are associated with the Kitchen God, especially defining the date of the &quot;Kitchen God festival&quot;, also known as &quot;Little New Year&quot;. It is noted that the date differed depending on the location. It is believed that people in northern China celebrate it on the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunisolar month, while the people in southern China celebrate it on the twenty-fourth. Along with location, traditionally the date may also be determined by one&#x27;s Profession. For example, &quot;feudal officials made their offerings to the Kitchen God on the twenty-third, the common people on the twenty-fourth, and coastal fishing people on the twenty-fifth&quot;. In addition, generally it was the males of the household that lead the sacrificial rites.

In order to establish a fresh beginning in the New Year, families must be organized both within their family unit, in their home, and around their yard. This custom of a thorough house cleaning and yard cleaning is another popular custom during &quot;Little New Year&quot;. It is believed that in order for ghosts and deities to depart to Heaven, both their homes and &quot;persons&quot; must be cleansed. Lastly, the old decorations are taken down, and there are new posters and decorations put up for the following Spring Festival.

In the 1970s in northern Taiwan, families generally had a &quot;large brick cooking stove&quot; where they cooked most meals was seen as the &quot;corporate&quot; embodiment of the family and its individuality. The &quot;soul of the family&quot; that was identical to its fate as a singular, &quot;corporate&quot; body or entity was thought to be located in the stove. When family members move away, younger brothers transfer &quot;hot coals from the old stove to their new ones, thereby inviting the Stove God to join them.&quot;

==Family==
Independent Chinese families are classified accordingly to the stove they possess. Because circumstances of a divided household, kitchens are shared but never the stove. In the case of a father&#x27;s death, the sons divide their father&#x27;s household. The eldest son inherits the stove and the younger brothers transfer the coals from the old stove to their own new stoves. This invites the Stove god to join their newly formed households. This process is called &quot;pun chu&quot; or dividing the stove. This indicates the &quot;soul&quot; of the family and it signifies fate of the family.

An event involving a stove that became a Chinese story which said, &quot;&#x27;When a shaman informed one family that there were ants and other things in their stove, they destroyed the stove and threw the bricks and coals into the river.&#x27; A neighbor explained, &#x27;There was nothing else they could do. A family will never have peace if they don&#x27;t have a good stove.&#x27;&quot;

 state that, &quot;The association of Stove God and God is thus an association of God and family. The Character of the relationship is essentially bureaucratic; the family is the smallest corporate unit in society, and the Stove God is the lowest ranking member of a supernatural bureaucracy.&quot; This relates a correlation of the Stove god and the importance of this deity is to the family unit.

The domestic deity is seen as being in charge of watching over the home life. It has been expressed that his presence is more like that of a policeman sent from above to observe the family. This practice is known as a bureaucratization of religion in Chinese society. The Jade Emperor is in charge of an administration divided into bureaus, and each bureaucrat-god takes responsibility for a clearly defined domain or discrete function. The Kitchen God would thus serve the role of the home domain as he would overlook the daily dynamics of a family, the members and their behavior.

 also states that there are three levels of cosmology containing an organization of heaven is like that of the organization on earth. With a supreme deity – an Emperor (Jade Emperor or Heavenly God) – Local Officials (City gods) – Commoners (gods of the hearth). This confirms the organization of the heavens and how the Kitchen God reports to higher level God, the Jade Emperor.

According to , there is another god that shares the realm of the household:

The Privy goddess was worshiped only by women and no temples have been erected in her honor and has no relation or interaction with the Kitchen God.

==In literature==
The Chinese story () &quot;Visit of the Spirit of the kitchen to Iô-kung&quot; or &quot;Visit of the Spirit of the kitchen to Yu-gong&quot; is about the Kitchen God who visits a scholar who does good deeds only for selfish intentions, and convinces him to reform himself to avoid punishment. The story was translated into Manchu as Wylie: Iô gung chun i enduri pe utcharaha gi pitghe, Möllendorff: Iū gung jun i enduri be ucaraha gi bithe.
Laurence Yep&#x27;s novel &quot;Dragonwings&quot; describes the honey ritual, but the book refers to the deity as the Stove King.

Zao Jun&#x27;s story is interwoven with a feminist spin into the protagonist&#x27;s story in Amy Tan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Kitchen God&#x27;s Wife&quot;. She reflects on her life story as a Chinese American woman. She uses the symbolism of the Kitchen God&#x27;s story and uses it as a parallel towards modern day life. She outlines the patriarchy that still exists within modern day life but more significantly in Chinese cultural practices. Tan also illustrates several facets of the humble status of women in Chinese society in the early 20th century.

In Tan&#x27;s story, there is an elaborate description of the coming of Zao Jun. The character Winnie goes into detail about how he came to be and attempts to address cultural struggles as she removes the picture of the Kitchen God from her daughter Pearl&#x27;s stove, as she does not believe this is the kind of luck Pearl needs. She then promises to fill the altar with the image of another god. In addition to this cultural struggle there is also a feminist undertone in the ritual, which can be viewed as a struggle between traditionalism and biculturalism.

<doc id="312802" wikidata="Q116057" url="?curid=312802" title="Alfred Cortot">
<text>Alfred Denis Cortot ( , ; 26 September 187715 June 1962) was a French pianist, conductor, and teacher who was one of the most renowned classical musicians of the 20th century. A pianist of massive repertory, he was especially valued for his poetic insight into Romantic piano works, particularly those of Chopin, Franck, Saint-Saëns and Schumann. For Éditions Durand, he edited editions of almost all piano music by Chopin, Liszt and Schumann.

A central figure of the French musical culture in his time, he was well known for his piano trio with violinist Jacques Thibaud and cellist Pablo Casals.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cortot was born in Nyon, Vaud, in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, to a French father and a Swiss mother. His nationality was French. His first cousin was the composer Edgard Varèse. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Émile Decombes (a student of Frédéric Chopin), and with Louis Diémer, taking a &quot;premier prix&quot; in 1896. He made his debut at the Concerts Colonne in 1897, playing Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3.

Between 1898 and 1901 he was a choral coach and subsequently an assistant conductor at the Bayreuth Festival. In 1902 he conducted the Paris premiere of Wagner&#x27;s music drama &quot;Götterdämmerung (&quot;The Twilight of the Gods). He formed a concert society named &quot;Société des Concerts&quot; to perform Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;, Brahms&#x27; &quot;German Requiem&quot;, and new works by French composers.

===Career===
In 1905, Cortot formed a trio with Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals, which established itself as the leading piano trio of its era. In 1907, he was appointed Professor by Gabriel Fauré at the Conservatoire de Paris, replacing Raoul Pugno. He continued to teach at the Paris Conservatoire until 1923, where his pupils included Yvonne Lefébure, Vlado Perlemuter, Simone Plé-Caussade, Magdeleine Brard, Marguerite Monnot, and Rodica Sutzu.

In 1919, Cortot founded the École Normale de Musique de Paris. His courses in musical interpretation were legendary. For his many notable students, see here.

As a leading musical figure, Cortot traveled for many international music events. The French government sponsored two promotional tours to the United States and one to the Soviet Union in 1920. He conducted several orchestras and was often called upon to provide piano accompaniment for touring artists when in Paris. He was involved in music until his health failed, and taught master classes in piano in his advanced years.

On 21 March 1925, Cortot made the world&#x27;s first commercial electrical recording of classical music for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey: Chopin&#x27;s Impromptus and Schubert&#x27;s Litanei, issued on Victor&#x27;s Red Seal label.

===World War II===
During World War II, he accepted the position of &quot;Haut-Commissaire&quot; (&quot;High Commissioner&quot;) for arts in the Vichy government and served twice (1941 and 1942) as a member of the Vichy&#x27;s &quot;Conseil national&quot; (&quot;National Council&quot;). However, before this he took a strong stance in defending the French music tradition with the Beaux Arts administration (Fine Arts) supporting soldiers with music. Cortot had to leave this position after Pétain&#x27;s appointment and exerted his energy instead into writing reports about cultural propaganda and defending French musical styles. He was charged with musical reform by the Pétain government, and the Vichy took control of musical activities. He became part of the&quot; comité d&#x27;organisation professionelle de la musique (The committee for the professional organisation of music)&quot; in 1942 and worked with Laval and Pétain.

In 1941 he participated in a &quot;Propaganda Staffel&quot; (Propaganda Squad) festival in Paris, and in 1942 played with Wilhelm Kempff for Nazi artist Arno Breker&#x27;s art exposition, later meeting with Breker at Paul Morand&#x27;s home. Pierre Laval was also present. Morand had a statue made of Cortot after his impression. He participated in official concerts in Paris during the occupation as well as in Germany in 1942.

Daisy Fancourt writes:
After the war&#x27;s conclusion, Cortot was found guilty by a French government panel of collaboration with the enemy and was suspended from performing for a year. He said in his defence, &quot;I&#x27;ve given 50 years of my life to helping the French cause [...] when I was asked to become involved with the interests of my comrades, I felt I couldn&#x27;t refuse. [...] I represented the interests of the French government less than the interests of France. [...] I have never been involved in politics.&quot; Once the suspension expired he returned to performing more than 100 concerts a season.

===Death===
Cortot died on 15 June 1962, aged 84, of uremia from kidney failure in Lausanne, Switzerland. His son was the painter, Jean Cortot.

==Contribution==

As one of the most celebrated piano interpreters of Chopin, Schumann and Debussy, Cortot produced printed editions of the piano works of all three, notable for their inclusion of meticulous commentary on technical problems and matters of interpretation.

Cortot suffered from memory lapses in concert (particularly notable from the 1940s onwards) and often left wrong notes on his later records. When in form, however, he showed a brilliant technique that could handle almost any kind of pianism. This gift is evident in his legendary recordings of Liszt&#x27;s Sonata in B minor (the first recording ever made of the work) and Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Etude en forme de valse&quot;. The latter thoroughly impressed Vladimir Horowitz, who – according to Cortot – approached Cortot to learn his &quot;secret&quot; in performing it; Cortot, however, did not divulge it to him.

He also wrote a good deal of didactic prose, including a piano primer: &quot;Rational Principles of Pianoforte Technique&quot;. This book contains many finger exercises to aid in the development of various aspects of piano playing technique.

<text>Reasons and Persons is a 1984 book by the philosopher Derek Parfit, in which the author discusses ethics, rationality and personal identity.

It is divided into four parts, dedicated to self-defeating theories, rationality and time, personal identity and responsibility toward future generations.

==Summary==

===Self-defeating theories===

Part 1 argues that certain ethical theories are &quot;self-defeating&quot;. One such theory is ethical egoism, which Parfit claims is &#x27;collectively self-defeating&#x27; due to the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, though he does not believe this is sufficient grounds to reject the theory. Ultimately, Parfit does reject &quot;common sense morality&quot; on similar grounds.

In this section, Parfit does not explicitly endorse a particular view; rather, he shows what the problems of different theories are. His only positive endorsement is of &quot;impersonal ethics&quot; – impersonality being the common denominator of the different parts of the book.

===Rationality and time===

Part 2 focuses on the relationship between rationality and time, dealing with questions such as: &quot;should we take into account our past desires?&quot;, &quot;should I do something I will regret later, even if it seems a good idea now?&quot;, and so on.

Parfit&#x27;s main purpose in Part 2 is to make an argument against self-interest theory. Self-interest theorists consider the differences between different persons to be extremely important, but do not consider the differences between the same person at different times to be important at all. Parfit argues that this makes self-interest theory vulnerable to attack from two directions. It can be compared to morality on one side, and &#x27;present-aim theory&#x27; on the other. Parfit argues that our present aims can sometimes conflict with our long term self-interest. Arguments that a self-interest theorist uses to explain why it is irrational to act on such aims, can be turned against the self-interest theorist, and used as arguments in favor of morality. Conversely, arguments that a self-interest theorist uses against morality could also be used as arguments in support of &#x27;present-aim&#x27; theory.

===Personal identity===

Part 3 argues for a reductive account of personal identity; rather than accepting the claim that our existence is a deep, significant fact about the world, Parfit&#x27;s account of personal identity is like this:

At time 1, there is a person. At a later time 2, there is a person. These people seem to be the same person. Indeed, these people share memories and personality traits. But there are no further facts in the world that make them the &quot;same person&quot;.

 Parfit&#x27;s argument for this position relies on our intuitions regarding thought experiments such as teleportation, the fission and fusion of persons, gradual replacement of the matter in one&#x27;s brain, gradual alteration of one&#x27;s psychology, and so on. For example, Parfit asks the reader to imagine entering a &quot;teletransporter,&quot; a machine that puts you to sleep, then destroys you, breaking you down into atoms, copying the information and relaying it to Mars at the speed of light. On Mars, another machine re-creates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative position. Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is a method of travel—is the person on Mars the &quot;same person&quot; as the person who entered the teletransporter on Earth? Certainly, when waking up on Mars, you would feel like being you, you would remember entering the teletransporter in order to travel to Mars, you would even feel the cut on your upper lip from shaving this morning.

Then the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who enters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering the teletransporter on Earth in the first place.

Using thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine sameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact. What matters, to Parfit, is simply &quot;Relation R,&quot; psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.

Parfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is morally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to protect individuals from such transgressions. That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it is also incumbent on society to protect an individual&#x27;s &quot;Future Self&quot; from such transgressions; tobacco use could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self&#x27;s right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic to reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not explicitly endorse such invasive control.

Parfit&#x27;s conclusion is similar to David Hume&#x27;s bundle theory, and also to the view of the self in Buddhism&#x27;s Skandha, though it does not restrict itself to a mere reformulation of them. For besides being &quot;reductive&quot;, Parfit&#x27;s view is also &quot;deflationary&quot;: in the end, &quot;what matters&quot; is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and connectedness.

===Future generations===

Part 4 deals with questions of our responsibility towards future generations, also known as population ethics. It raises questions about whether it can be wrong to create a life, whether environmental destruction violates the rights of future people, and so on.

One question Parfit raises is this: given that the course of history drastically affects what people are actually born (since it affects which potential parents actually meet and have children; and also, a difference in the time of conception will alter the genetic makeup of the child), do future persons have a right to complain about our actions, since they likely wouldn&#x27;t exist if things had been different? This is called the non-identity problem.

Another problem Parfit looks at is the &quot;mere addition paradox&quot;, which supposedly shows that it is better to have a lot of people who are slightly happy, than a few people who are very happy. Parfit calls this view &quot;repugnant&quot;, but says he has not yet found a solution.

== Reception ==
Bernard Williams described &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; as &quot;brilliantly clever and imaginative&quot;, and commended it as part of a wave of work in analytic philosophy that deals with concrete moral problems rather than abstract meta-ethics.

Philip Kitcher wrote in his review of Parfit&#x27;s &quot;On What Matters&quot; that &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; &quot;was widely viewed as an outstanding contribution to a cluster of questions in metaphysics and ethics&quot;.

Peter Singer included &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; on a top ten list of favourite books in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating that &quot;Parfit&#x27;s penetrating thought and spare prose make this one of the most exciting, if challenging, works by a contemporary philosopher&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, the philosopher P.F. Strawson gave the book a positive review, stating &quot;Very few works in the subject can compare with Parfit’s in scope, fertility, imaginative resource, and cogency of reasoning&quot;.

In an interview, David Chalmers said that he &quot;loved&quot; &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;, saying that it gave him a &quot;sense of how powerful analytic philosophy can be when done clearly and accessibly.&quot;

<text>Mămăligă (;) is a polenta-like dish made out of yellow maize flour, traditional in Romania, Moldova, south-west regions of Ukraine and among Poles in Ukraine, Hungary (&quot;puliszka&quot;), the Black Sea regions of Georgia and Turkey, and Thessaly and Phthiotis, as well as in Bulgaria (&quot;kačamak&quot;) and in Greece. It is also eaten in Italy, Switzerland, Southern France, Slovenia, Croatia, Brazil, often with the name &quot;polenta&quot;.

== History ==

Historically a peasant food, it was often used as a substitute for bread or even as a staple food in the poor rural areas. However, in the last decades it has emerged as an upscale dish available in the finest restaurants.

Maize was consumed by Romani slaves in Wallachia and Moldavia, as well as Muslim slaves, who were prisoners of war.

=== Roman influence ===

Historically, porridge is the oldest form of consumption of grains in the whole of humanity, long before the appearance of bread. Originally, the seeds used to prepare slurries were very diverse as millet or einkorn.

Before the introduction of maize in Europe in the 16th century A.D., mămăligă had been made with millet flour, known to the Romans as &quot;pulmentum&quot;.

=== Corn&#x27;s introduction in the Romanian lands ===

Maize was introduced into Spain by Hernán Cortés from Mexico in 1530 and spread in Europe in the 16th century. Maize (called &quot;corn&quot; in the United States) requires a good amount of heat and humidity. The Danube Valley is one of Europe&#x27;s regions ideal for growing maize.

A Hungarian scholar documented the arrival of corn in Timișoara, Banat region, 1692. In Transylvania, maize is also called &#x27;cucuruz&#x27;, which could imply a connection between Transylvanian and Serbian merchants, kukuruz being a Slavic word. Some assume it was either Șerban Cantacuzino or Constantin Mavrocordat who introduced corn in Wallachia, Maria Theresa in Transylvania and Constantine Ducas in Moldavia where it is called păpușoi.
Mămăligă of millet would have been replaced gradually by mămăligă made of corn. Corn then became an important food, especially in the fight against famine, which prevailed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Historian Nicolae Iorga noted that farmers of the Romanian Principalities had grown corn since the early-to-mid-17th century.

Etienne Ignace Raicevich, a Ragusan consul of Napoleonic France to Bucharest in the fourth quarter of the 18th century, wrote that corn was introduced only &quot;da poco tempo&quot; (recently).

Before the arrival of maize in Eastern Europe, &quot;mămăligă&quot; was made of millet flour. Long lost, millet &quot;mămăligă&quot; is now again fashionable in western Europe.

== Preparation ==

Traditionally, &quot;mămăligă&quot; is cooked by boiling water, salt and cornmeal in a special-shaped cast iron pot called &quot;ceaun&quot; or &quot;tuci&quot;. When cooked peasant-style and used as a bread substitute, &quot;mămăligă&quot; is supposed to be much thicker than the regular Italian polenta to the point that it can be cut in slices, like bread. When cooked for other purposes, &quot;mămăligă&quot; can be much softer, sometimes almost to the consistency of porridge. Because &quot;mămăligă&quot; sticks to metal surfaces, a piece of sewing thread is used to cut it into slices instead of a knife; it can then be eaten by holding it with the hand, just like bread.

&quot;Mămăligă&quot; is a versatile food: various recipes of &quot;mămăligă&quot;-based dishes may include milk, butter, various types of cheese, eggs, sausages (usually fried, grilled or oven-roasted), bacon, mushrooms, ham, fish etc. &quot;Mămăligă&quot; is a fat-free, cholesterol-free, high-fiber food. It can be used as a healthy alternative to more refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, or hulled rice.

=== Serving mămăligă ===

&quot;Mămăligă&quot; is often served with sour cream and cheese on the side (&quot;mămăligă cu brânză și smântână&quot;) or crushed in a bowl of hot milk (&quot;mămăligă cu lapte&quot;). Sometimes slices of &quot;mămăligă&quot; are pan-fried in oil or in lard, the result being a sort of corn pone.

The traditional Moldavian meal is often served with meat, usually pork or fried fish, and mujdei, a garlic-and-oil sauce. Harder boiled mamaliga is traditionally cut with a string, so it wouldn&#x27;t stick on a knife.

=== Similar dishes ===

Since &quot;mămăligă&quot; can be used as an alternative for bread in many Romanian and Moldovan dishes, there are quite a few which are either based on &quot;mămăligă&quot;, or include it as an ingredient or side dish. Arguably, the most popular of them is sarmale (a type of cabbage roll/grapevine roll) with &quot;mămăligă&quot;.

Another very popular Romanian dish based on &quot;mămăligă&quot; is called bulz, and consists of &quot;mămăligă&quot; with cheese and butter and roasted in the oven.

Balmoș (sometimes spelled balmuș) is another &quot;mămăligă&quot;-like traditional Romanian dish, but is more elaborate. Unlike &quot;mămăligă&quot; (where the cornmeal is boiled in water) when making &quot;balmoș&quot; the cornmeal must be boiled in sheep milk. Other ingredients, such as butter, sour cream, &quot;telemea&quot; (a type of feta cheese), &quot;caș&quot; (a type of fresh curdled ewe cheese without whey, which is sometimes called &quot;green cheese&quot; in English), &quot;urdă&quot; (similar to ricotta), etc., are added to the mixture at certain times during the cooking process. It is a specialty dish of old Romanian shepherds, and nowadays very few people still know how to make a proper &quot;balmoș&quot;.

== In literature ==

In Chapter One of &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker, the character Jonathan Harker writes, &quot;I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was &#x27;mamaliga&#x27;, and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call &#x27;impletata&#x27;&quot;.

As a traditional Szekler food, it also appears in Hungarian folktales multiple times, for example in &quot;Szép Palkó&quot;.

== Similar dishes ==
Cornmeal mush is its analogue common in some regions of the United States and grits in the southern regions.

Its analogue in Serbia and Bulgaria is called kačamak (, ) and is served mainly with white brine cheese or pork rind (fried pieces of pork fat with parts of the skin).

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia (also &quot;polenta&quot; or &quot;palenta&quot;), Serbia (also &quot;kačamak&quot;) and in Montenegro, the dish is mainly called &quot;pura&quot;. In North Macedonia, it is called &quot;bakrdan&quot; () and in Slovenia, &quot;polenta&quot;.

Hungarians call it &quot;puliszka, and is traditionally eaten in both salty and sweet form&quot;. It is also called kukoricamálé, kukoricagánica or ganca.

The Transylvanian Saxons call it &#x27;palukes&#x27; in their traditional cuisine.

In Turkey, it is also called mamaliga, or kaçamak. Another similar dish, called &quot;kuymak&quot; or &quot;muhlama&quot;, is among the typical dishes of the Black Sea Region, although now popular in all the greater cities where there are many regional restaurants.

Broccoliga is a variant of Mămăligă featuring a broccoli-polenta mixture suffused with cheddar cheese and herbs.

Known by different names in local languages ( &quot;abysta&quot;, &quot;mamrys&quot;, &quot;ghomi&quot;, &quot;zhuran-khudar&quot;, Chechen: &quot;ah&#x27;ar-hudar/zhuran-hudar&quot;, Nogai: мамырза &quot;mamyrza&quot;, &quot;sir, sorsera&quot;), it is also widespread in Caucasian cuisines.

There is also a distinct similarity to &quot;cou-cou&quot; (as it is known in the Barbados), or &quot;fungi&quot; (as it is known in Antigua and Barbuda and other Leeward Islands in the Caribbean Sea).

This dish is eaten widely across Africa, often with white maize flour instead of yellow, where it has different local names:

<text>Ethics involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. A central aspect of ethics is &quot;the good life&quot;, the life worth living or life that is simply satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than traditional moral conduct.

Most religions have an ethical component, often derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Some assert that religion is necessary to live ethically. Simon Blackburn states that there are those who &quot;would say that we can only flourish under the umbrella of a strong social order, cemented by common adherence to a particular religious tradition&quot;.

==Buddhist ethics==

Ethics in Buddhism are traditionally based on the enlightened perspective of the Buddha, or other enlightened beings who followed him. Moral instructions are included in Buddhist scriptures or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of Buddhist scriptures, and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.

According to traditional Buddhism, the foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is the Pancasila: no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, or intoxicants. In becoming a Buddhist, or affirming one&#x27;s commitment to Buddhism, a layperson is encouraged to vow to abstain from these negative actions. Buddhist monks and nuns take hundreds more such vows (see vinaya).

This approach avoids basing Buddhist ethics solely on faith in the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment or Buddhist tradition, and may allow more universal non-Buddhist access to the insights offered by Buddhist ethics.

The Buddha provided some basic guidelines for acceptable behavior that are part of the Noble Eightfold Path. The initial percept is non-injury or non-violence to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans. This precept defines a non-violent attitude toward every living thing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by Jainism, but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.

Theravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi has observed:Buddhist ethics, as formulated in the five precepts, is sometimes charged with being entirely negative. ... [I]t has to be pointed out that the five precepts, or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha, do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethics. The precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training, but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtues. The Mangala Sutta, for example, commends reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, patience, generosity, etc. Other discourses prescribe numerous family, social, and political duties establishing the well being of society. And behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the &quot;immeasurables&quot; – loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.

==Christian ethics==

Christian ethics is a branch of Christian theology that defines virtuous behavior and wrong behavior from a Christian perspective. Systematic theological study of Christian ethics is called &quot;moral theology&quot;.

Christian virtues are often divided into four cardinal virtues and three theological virtues. Christian ethics includes questions regarding how the rich should act toward the poor, how women are to be treated, and the morality of war. Christian ethicists, like other ethicists, approach ethics from different frameworks and perspectives. The approach of virtue ethics has also become popular in recent decades, largely due to the work of Alasdair MacIntyre and Stanley Hauerwas.

There are several different schema of vice and virtue. Aquinas adopted the four cardinal virtues of Aristotle (justice, courage, temperance and prudence), and added to them the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity (). Other schema include the Seven Deadly Sins and the Seven virtues.

==Confucian ethics==

Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism emphasize the maintenance and propriety of relationships as the most important consideration in ethics. To be ethical is to do what one&#x27;s relationships require. Notably, though, what you owe to another person is inversely proportional to their distance from you. In other words, you owe your parents everything, but you are not in any way obligated towards strangers. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that it is impossible to love the entire world equally and simultaneously. This is called relational ethics, or situational ethics. The Confucian system differs very strongly from Kantian ethics in that there are rarely laws or principles which can be said to be true absolutely or universally.

This is not to say that there has never been any consideration given to universalist ethics. In fact, in Zhou dynasty China, the Confucians&#x27; main opponents, the followers of Mozi argued for universal love (). The Confucian view eventually held sway, however, and continues to dominate many aspects of Chinese thought. Many have argued, for example, that Mao Zedong was more Confucian than Communist. Confucianism, especially of the type argued for by Mencius, argued that the ideal ruler is the one who (as Confucius put it) &quot;acts like the North Star, staying in place while the other stars orbit around it&quot;. In other words, the ideal ruler does not go out and force the people to become good, but instead leads by example. The ideal ruler fosters harmony rather than laws.

Confucius stresses honesty above all. His concepts of lĭ (), yì (), and rén () can be seen as deeper expressions of honesty () and fidelity () to the ones to whom one owes one&#x27;s existence (parents) and survival (one&#x27;s neighbours, colleagues, inferiors in rank). He codified traditional practice and actually changed the meaning of the prior concepts that those words had meant. His model of the Confucian family and Confucian ruler dominated Chinese life into the early 20th century. This had ossified by then into an Imperial hierarchy of rigid property rights, hard to distinguish from any other dictatorship. Traditional ethics had been perverted by legalism.

===Buddhist influence===

Buddhism, and specifically Mahayana Buddhism, brought a cohesive metaphysic to Chinese thought and a strong emphasis on universalism. Neo-Confucianism was largely a reaction to Buddhism&#x27;s dominance in the Tang dynasty, and an attempt at developing a native Confucian metaphysical/analytical system.

==Germanic Neopagan ethics==
Germanic Neopagans, including followers of both Asatru and Theodism, try to emulate the ethical values of the ancient Germanic peoples (Norse or Anglo-Saxon).

==Hindu ethics ==

Ethics is called Nitisastra () in ancient texts of Hinduism. Ethics and virtue are a much debated and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism. Virtue, right conduct, ethics and morality are part of the complex concept Hindus call Dharma – everything that is essential for people, the world and nature to exist and prosper together, in harmony. As P.V. Kane, the author of the History of Dharmasastra said, the term &quot;Dharma&quot; does not have a synonym in English language. While it is often interpreted as meaning &quot;duty&quot;, it can mean justice, right, moral, good, and much more.

Ethics are explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, Apastamba explained it thus: &quot;virtue and vice do not go about saying – here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us – this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one&#x27;s life.

Ethics that constitute a dharmic life – that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life – evolve in vedas and upanishads. Ethical subjects and questions are debated by various schools of Hinduism, quite extensively, in numerous texts on what is right conduct, when, how and why. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, Manusamhita initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a &quot;dharmic&quot; life: &quot;Dhriti&quot; (courage), &quot;Kshama&quot; (forgiveness), &quot;Dama&quot; (temperance), &quot;Asteya&quot; (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), &quot;Saucha&quot; (inner purity), &quot;Indriyani-graha&quot; (control of senses), &quot;dhi&quot; (reflective prudence), &quot;vidya&quot; (wisdom), &quot;satyam&quot; (truthfulness), &quot;akrodha&quot; (freedom from anger). In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: &quot;Ahimsa&quot; (Non-violence), &quot;Dama&quot; (self restraint), &quot;Asteya&quot; (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), &quot;Saucha&quot; (inner purity), &quot;Satyam&quot; (truthfulness).

The Persian historian Al Biruni who visited and lived in India for 16 years in the early 11th century, describes the concept of ethics and virtuous behavior among Hindus of his times. Of ethical mandates among Hindus, a literal translation of his Persian language manuscript includes (1) A man shall not kill; (2) nor lie; (3) nor steal; (4) nor whore; (5) nor hoard up treasures. These correspond to five &quot;Yamas&quot; of ancient Hindu ethics: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth, non-falsehood), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (celibacy if unmarried and non-cheating on one&#x27;s partner if married), and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness). In addition to these five negative things to abstain from, Hindu ethics also recommends five positive things to strive for as &quot;Niyamas&quot;: &quot;Śauca&quot; (purity in body, speech and mind), &quot;Santosha&quot; (contentment, acceptance of circumstances with optimism), &quot;Tapas&quot; (perseverance, meditation, austerity), &quot;Swadhyaya&quot; (lifelong learning) and &quot;Pranidhan&quot; (right attitude, contemplation). An ethical life in Hinduism is essential for a liberated life, one without craving, one that is content, attained through knowledge and by abstaining from evil.

Hindu literature variously discuss ethics as one or more of four topics: (1) &quot;Gunas&quot; that is inner tendencies of conduct found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) &quot;Purushartha&quot; that is proper aims of life for every individual for self-development and happiness (dharma, artha, kama and moksha); (3) &quot;Ashramas&quot; that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one&#x27;s lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) &quot;Varnasramas&quot; that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society. Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism. Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes: (1) ethics is an essential part of dharma concept, (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which – suggests Hinduism – ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible, and (3) Ethics cannot always be dualistically or non-dualistically reduced from first principles, ethics is closely related to moksha (self realization and spiritual freedom) with Vivekacudamani stating, &quot;individuals with self knowledge and spiritual freedom are inherently self examining and ethical&quot; and &quot;ethics, freedom and knowledge require each other&quot;. In addition to the above four topics in Hindu ethics, scholars state that the karma doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.

The Bhagavad Gita – considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong – argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as Ahimsa must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.

==Islamic ethics==

The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding that mankind has been granted the faculty to discern God&#x27;s will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting on the meaning of existence, which, as John Kelsay in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Ethics&quot; phrases, &quot;ultimately points to the reality of God.&quot; Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a moral responsibility to submit to God&#x27;s will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah, or the sayings of Muhammad ).

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur&#x27;an, subverted by mankind&#x27;s focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished among one&#x27;s peers. Ultimately, the focus on materialism, according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of &quot;jahiliyya&quot; or &quot;ignorance&quot;.

Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other prophets in Islam, was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon Islamic piety, an &quot;ummah&quot;;
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah – a view challenged by strict Islamic monotheism, which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of &quot;muruwwa&quot; (manliness), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the day of resurrection;
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam – which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, world view, and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the Arabian Peninsula. For Muhammad, although pre-Islamic Arabia exemplified &quot;heedlessness&quot;, it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one&#x27;s near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of justice. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict monotheism.

Furthermore, a Muslim should not only follow these five main characteristics, but also be more broad about his morals. Therefore, the more the Muslim is applying these rules, the better that person is morally. For example, Islamic ethics can be applied by important verses in the Quran. The most fundamental characteristics of a Muslim are piety and humility. A Muslim must be humble with God and with other people:

Muslims must be in control of their passions and desires.

A Muslim should not be vain or attached to the ephemeral pleasures of this world. While most people allow the material world to fill their hearts, Muslims should keep God in their hearts and the material world in their hand. Instead of being attached to the car and the job and the diploma and the bank account, all these things become tools to make us better people.
Morality in Islam addresses every aspect of a Muslim&#x27;s life, from greetings to international relations. It is universal in its scope and in its applicability. Morality reigns in selfish desires, vanity and bad habits. Muslims must not only be virtuous, but they must also enjoin virtue. They must not only refrain from evil and vice, but they must also forbid them. In other words, they must not only be morally healthy, but they must also contribute to the moral health of society as a whole.

Muhammad summarized the conduct of a Muslim when he said:
&quot;My Sustainer has given me nine commands: to remain conscious of God, whether in private or in public; to speak justly, whether angry or pleased; to show moderation both when poor and when rich, to reunite friendship with those who have broken off with me; to give to him who refuses me; that my silence should be occupied with thought; that my looking should be an admonition; and that I should command what is right.&quot;

Islam is a way of life and it does not work in isolation. In a business practice for example, the Muslims are call to adhere good business ethical values, does not cheat, and does not charge interests to the buyers. Research has also observed how Islamic religiosity influences work ethics and business ethics.

Attempts to reestablish ethics and re-conceptualize Islamic ethical theory had emerged during the 20th century by figures like: Muhammad Abdullah Draz, Muhammad Iqbal, Alija Izetbegović, and Taha Abdulrahman who developed a religious contractarian theory of ethics.

==Jain ethics==
Jainism teaches five ethical duties, which it calls five vows. These are called &quot;anuvratas&quot; (small vows) for Jain laypersons, and &quot;mahavratas&quot; (great vows) for Jain mendicants. For both, its moral precepts preface that the Jain has access to a &quot;guru&quot; (teacher, counsellor), &quot;deva&quot; (Jina, god), doctrine, and that the individual is free from five offences: doubts about the faith, indecisiveness about the truths of Jainism, sincere desire for Jain teachings, recognition of fellow Jains, and admiration for their spiritual pursuits. Such a person undertakes the following five vows of Jainism:
# &quot;Ahiṃsā&quot;, &quot;intentional non-violence&quot; or &quot;noninjury&quot;: The first major vow taken by Jains is to cause no harm to other human beings, as well as all living beings (particularly animals). This is the highest ethical duty in Jainism, and it applies not only to one&#x27;s actions, but demands that one be non-violent in one&#x27;s speech and thoughts.
# &quot;Satya&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;: This vow is to always speak the truth. Neither lie, nor speak what is not true, and do not encourage others or approve anyone who speaks an untruth.
# &quot;Asteya&quot;, &quot;not stealing&quot;: A Jain layperson should not take anything that is not willingly given. Additionally, a Jain mendicant should ask for permission to take it if something is being given.
# &quot;Brahmacharya&quot;, &quot;celibacy&quot;: Abstinence from sex and sensual pleasures is prescribed for Jain monks and nuns. For laypersons, the vow means chastity, faithfulness to one&#x27;s partner.
# &quot;Aparigraha&quot;, &quot;non-possessiveness&quot;: This includes non-attachment to material and psychological possessions, avoiding craving and greed. Jain monks and nuns completely renounce property and social relations, own nothing and are attached to no one.

Jainism also prescribes seven supplementary vows, including three &quot;guņa vratas&quot; (merit vows) and four &quot;śikşā vratas&quot;. The &quot;Sallekhana&quot; (or &quot;Santhara&quot;) vow is a &quot;religious death&quot; ritual vow observed at the end of life, historically by Jain monks and nuns, but rare in the modern age. In this vow, there is voluntary and gradual reduction of food and liquid intake to end one&#x27;s life by choice and with dispassion, In Jainism this is believed to reduce negative karma that affects a soul&#x27;s future rebirths.

==Jewish ethics==

Jewish ethics may be said to originate with the Hebrew Bible, its broad legal injunctions, wisdom narratives and prophetic teachings. Most subsequent Jewish ethical claims may be traced back to the texts, themes and teachings of the written Torah.

In early rabbinic Judaism, the Oral Torah both interprets the Hebrew Bible and delves afresh into many other ethical topics. The best known rabbinic text associated with ethics is the non-legal Mishnah tractate of &quot;Avot&quot;, popularly translated as &quot;Ethics of the Fathers&quot;. Generally, ethics is a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, known as aggadah, and ethical teachings are found throughout the more legal (halakhic) portions of the Mishnah, Talmud and other rabbinic literature. This early Rabbinic ethics shows signs of cross-fertilization and polemical exchange with both the Greek (Western philosophical) ethical tradition and early Christian tradition.

In the medieval period, direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings. Notably, Maimonides offers a Jewish interpretation of Aristotle (e.g., &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. Maimonides, in turn, influences Thomas Aquinas, a dominant figure in Catholic ethics and the natural law tradition of moral theology. The relevance of natural law to medieval Jewish philosophy is a matter of dispute among scholars.

===Hellenistic influence===

Ethics in systematic form, and apart from religious belief, is as little found in apocryphal or Judæo-Hellenistic literature as in the Bible. However, Greek philosophy greatly influenced Alexandrian writers such as the authors of IV Maccabees, the Book of Wisdom, and Philo.

Much progress in theoretical ethics came as Jews came into closer contact with the Hellenic world. Before that period the Wisdom literature shows a tendency to dwell solely on the moral obligations and problems of life as appealing to man as an individual, leaving out of consideration the ceremonial and other laws which concern only the Jewish nation. From this point of view Ben Sira&#x27;s collection of sayings and monitions was written, translated into Greek, and circulated as a practical guide. The book contains popular ethics in proverbial form as the result of everyday life experience, without higher philosophical or religious principles and ideals.

More developed ethical works emanated from Hasidean circles in the Maccabean time, such as are contained in Tobit, especially in Chapter IV. Here the first ethical will or testament is found, giving a summary of moral teachings, with the Golden Rule, &quot;Do that to no man which thou hatest!&quot; as the leading maxim. There are even more elaborate ethical teachings in the &quot;Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs&quot;, in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob, in his last words to his children and children&#x27;s children, reviews his life and gives them moral lessons, either warning them against a certain vice he had been guilty of, so that they may avoid divine punishment, or recommending them to cultivate a certain virtue he had practised during life, so that they may win God&#x27;s favor. The chief virtues recommended are love for one&#x27;s fellow man, industry, especially in agricultural pursuits, simplicity, sobriety, benevolence toward the poor, compassion even for the brute and avoidance of all passion, pride, and hatred. Similar ethical farewell monitions are attributed to Enoch in the Ethiopic Enoch (xciv. et seq.) and the Slavonic Enoch (lviii. et seq.) and to the three patriarchs.

The Hellenistic Jewish propaganda literature made the propagation of Jewish ethics taken from the Bible its main object for the sake of winning the pagan world to pure monotheism. It was owing to this endeavor that certain ethical principles were laid down as guiding maxims for the Gentiles, first of all the three capital sins, idolatry, murder, and incest, were prohibited (see Sibyllines, iii. 38, 761; iv. 30 et seq.). In later Jewish rabbinic literature these Noachide Laws were gradually developed into six, seven, and ten, or thirty laws of ethics binding upon every human being.

==Judeo-Christian ethics==

The concept of Judaeo-Christian ethics has played a role in American politics, law, and moral discourse, tracing back to efforts in the 1930s and 1940s to highlight shared values amid rising antisemitism and societal divisions. Rooted in both Jewish and Christian traditions, has garnered support from leaders across the political spectrum, including Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. Roosevelt, in his inaugural address, invoked these values to unite the nation, emphasizing social justice and caring for one&#x27;s neighbor as principles upheld by both faiths. Similarly, Johnson strategically employed appeals to Judaeo-Christian ethics to rally support for civil rights legislation in the 1960s, framing discrimination as contrary to the moral principles shared by Jews and Christians.

While the concept of a Judaeo-Christian tradition has influenced American discourse and policymaking, scholars and theologians caution against uncritical usage; stressing the importance of acknowledging and respecting the distinct theological differences between Judaism and Christianity. Despite debates over its validity, the enduring presence of Judaeo-Christian ethics underscores its significance as a factor in American moral and political discourse, reflecting a commitment to common values amid diversity.

==Scientology ethics==

According to Stephen A. Kent, Scientology&#x27;s ethics is &quot;a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefitted [the Church of Scientology] ... In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people&#x27;s interests in things other than Scientology. In this &#x27;ethical&#x27; environment, Scientology would be able to impose its courses, philosophy, and &#x27;justice system&#x27; – its so-called technology – onto society.&quot;

==Secular ethics==
Secular ethics is a moral philosophy in which ethics are based solely on human faculties such as scientific reason, sociobiological composition, or ethical intuition, and not derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Secular ethics comprise a wide variety of moral and ethical systems including consequentialism, freethinking, humanism, secular humanism, and utilitarianism, among others.

The majority of secular moral concepts are based on the acceptance of natural rights and social contracts, and on a more individual scale of either some form of attribution of intrinsic value to things, Kantianesque ethical intuitionism or of a logical deduction that establishes a preference for one thing over another, as with Occam&#x27;s razor. Approaches such as ethical egoism, moral relativism, moral skepticism, and moral nihilism are also considered.

==Shinto ethics==

Shinto beliefs start with an assumption of the inherent goodness of humans as descendants of the &quot;kami&quot;. By the 6th century CE, Shinto had drawn from a Chinese idea that good people will adhere to societal norms, and emperors have a divine mandate to bring about the &quot;desirable and required order&quot;. Shinto adherents are to &quot;realize and carry out the will of the &quot;kami&quot; and the ancestors in the family, the community, and the nation&quot;.

Although State Shinto reinforced subordination to the emperor and the state, Shrine Shinto is a situation-based ethical system that emphasizes right actions toward others, versus adherence to a specific belief system. Shrine Shinto also stresses gratefulness for &quot;blessings of the &quot;kami&quot;&quot;, and maintaining harmony with the emperor and the world.

==Taoist ethics==

Laozi (Lao Tzu) and other Taoist (Daoist) authors argued for an even greater passivity on the part of rulers than did the Confucians. For Laozi, (Lao Tzu) the ideal ruler is one who does virtually nothing that can be directly identified as ruling. Clearly, both Daoism and Confucianism presume that human nature is basically good. The main branch of Confucianism, however, argues that human nature must be nurtured through ritual (&quot;li&quot; 禮), culture (&quot;wen&quot; 文) and other things, while the Daoists (Taoists) argued that the trappings of society were to be gotten rid of.

Taoist ethics ask for a greater &quot;sense of being&quot; and less identification with &quot;the act of&quot; &quot;doing&quot;. Taoist &quot;passivity&quot; nurtures, cultivates and prepares an atmosphere that allows &quot;the majestic&quot; and &quot;the real&quot; to shine, which influences society for the better.

&quot;If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself; if you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself. Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.&quot; – Lao Tzu

==Wiccan ethics==

Wiccan morality is largely based on the Wiccan Rede: &quot;An&#x27; it harm none, do what ye will&quot; – old-fashioned language for &quot;as long as you aren&#x27;t harming anyone, do as you wish&quot;. While this could be interpreted to mean &quot;do no harm at all&quot;, it is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of thinking through and taking responsibility for the consequences of one&#x27;s actions.

Another element of Wiccan Morality comes from the Law of Threefold Return, which is understood to mean that whatever one does to another person or thing (benevolent or otherwise) returns with triple force.

Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in Doreen Valiente&#x27;s &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot;, these being mirth, reverence, honour, humility, strength, beauty, power and compassion. In Valiente&#x27;s poem they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a dualism that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy.

==Zoroastrian ethics==

In Zoroastrianism, the purpose in life is to become an Ashavan (a master of Asha) and to bring happiness into the world, which contributes to the cosmic battle against evil. Zoroastrianism&#x27;s core teachings include but are not limited to:
* Follow the Threefold Path of Asha: Humata, Huxta, Huvarshta (Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds).
* Charity is a way of maintaining one&#x27;s soul aligned to Asha and to spread happiness.
* The spiritual equality and duty of the genders.
* Being good for the sake of goodness and without the hope of reward (see Ashem Vohu).

<text>Mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory and technique for the analysis and processing of geometrical structures, based on set theory, lattice theory, topology, and random functions. MM is most commonly applied to digital images, but it can be employed as well on graphs, surface meshes, solids, and many other spatial structures.

Topological and geometrical continuous-space concepts such as size, shape, convexity, connectivity, and geodesic distance, were introduced by MM on both continuous and discrete spaces. MM is also the foundation of morphological image processing, which consists of a set of operators that transform images according to the above characterizations.

The basic morphological operators are erosion, dilation, opening and closing.

MM was originally developed for binary images, and was later extended to grayscale functions and images. The subsequent generalization to complete lattices is widely accepted today as MM&#x27;s theoretical foundation.

== History ==
Mathematical Morphology was developed in 1964 by the collaborative work of Georges Matheron and Jean Serra, at the &quot;École des Mines de Paris&quot;, France. Matheron supervised the PhD thesis of Serra, devoted to the quantification of mineral characteristics from thin cross sections, and this work resulted in a novel practical approach, as well as theoretical advancements in integral geometry and topology.

In 1968, the &quot;Centre de Morphologie Mathématique&quot; was founded by the École des Mines de Paris in Fontainebleau, France, led by Matheron and Serra.

During the rest of the 1960s and most of the 1970s, MM dealt essentially with binary images, treated as sets, and generated a large number of binary operators and techniques: Hit-or-miss transform, dilation, erosion, opening, closing, granulometry, thinning, skeletonization, ultimate erosion, conditional bisector, and others. A random approach was also developed, based on novel image models. Most of the work in that period was developed in Fontainebleau.

From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, MM was generalized to grayscale functions and images as well. Besides extending the main concepts (such as dilation, erosion, etc.) to functions, this generalization yielded new operators, such as morphological gradients, top-hat transform and the Watershed (MM&#x27;s main segmentation approach).

In the 1980s and 1990s, MM gained a wider recognition, as research centers in several countries began to adopt and investigate the method. MM started to be applied to a large number of imaging problems and applications, especially in the field of non-linear filtering of noisy images.

In 1986, Serra further generalized MM, this time to a theoretical framework based on complete lattices. This generalization brought flexibility to the theory, enabling its application to a much larger number of structures, including color images, video, graphs, meshes, etc. At the same time, Matheron and Serra also formulated a theory for morphological filtering, based on the new lattice framework.

The 1990s and 2000s also saw further theoretical advancements, including the concepts of &quot;connections&quot; and &quot;levelings&quot;.

In 1993, the first International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology (ISMM) took place in Barcelona, Spain. Since then, ISMMs are organized every 2–3 years: Fontainebleau, France (1994); Atlanta, USA (1996); Amsterdam, Netherlands (1998); Palo Alto, CA, USA (2000); Sydney, Australia (2002); Paris, France (2005); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2007); Groningen, Netherlands (2009); Intra (Verbania), Italy (2011); Uppsala, Sweden (2013); Reykjavík, Iceland (2015); Fontainebleau, France (2017); and Saarbrücken, Germany (2019).

== Binary morphology ==

In binary morphology, an image is viewed as a subset of a Euclidean space formula_1 or the integer grid formula_2, for some dimension &quot;d&quot;.

=== Structuring element ===

The basic idea in binary morphology is to probe an image with a simple, pre-defined shape, drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the image. This simple &quot;probe&quot; is called the structuring element, and is itself a binary image (i.e., a subset of the space or grid).

Here are some examples of widely used structuring elements (denoted by &quot;B&quot;):

* Let formula_3; &quot;B&quot; is an open disk of radius &quot;r&quot;, centered at the origin.
* Let formula_4; &quot;B&quot; is a 3 × 3 square, that is, &quot;B&quot; = {(−1, −1), (−1, 0), (−1, 1), (0, −1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, −1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}.
* Let formula_4; &quot;B&quot; is the &quot;cross&quot; given by &quot;B&quot; = {(−1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}.

=== Basic operators ===
The basic operations are shift-invariant (translation invariant) operators strongly related to Minkowski addition.

Let &quot;E&quot; be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, and &quot;A&quot; a binary image in &quot;E&quot;.

==== Erosion ====
The erosion of the binary image &quot;A&quot; by the structuring element &quot;B&quot; is defined by

: formula_6

where &quot;B&quot;&quot;z&quot; is the translation of &quot;B&quot; by the vector &quot;z&quot;, i.e., formula_7, formula_8.

When the structuring element &quot;B&quot; has a center (e.g., &quot;B&quot; is a disk or a square), and this center is located on the origin of &quot;E&quot;, then the erosion of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; can be understood as the locus of points reached by the center of &quot;B&quot; when &quot;B&quot; moves inside &quot;A&quot;. For example, the erosion of a square of side 10, centered at the origin, by a disc of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 6 centered at the origin.

The erosion of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; is also given by the expression formula_9.

Example application: Assume we have received a fax of a dark photocopy. Everything looks like it was written with a pen that is bleeding. Erosion process will allow thicker lines to get skinny and detect the hole inside the letter &quot;o&quot;.

==== Dilation ====

The dilation of &quot;A&quot; by the structuring element &quot;B&quot; is defined by

: formula_10

The dilation is commutative, also given by formula_11.

If &quot;B&quot; has a center on the origin, as before, then the dilation of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; can be understood as the locus of the points covered by &quot;B&quot; when the center of &quot;B&quot; moves inside &quot;A&quot;. In the above example, the dilation of the square of side 10 by the disk of radius 2 is a square of side 14, with rounded corners, centered at the origin. The radius of the rounded corners is 2.

The dilation can also be obtained by formula_12, where &quot;B&quot;&quot;s&quot; denotes the symmetric of &quot;B&quot;, that is, formula_13.

Example application: dilation is the dual operation of the erosion. Figures that are very lightly drawn get thick when &quot;dilated&quot;. Easiest way to describe it is to imagine the same fax/text is written with a thicker pen.

==== Opening ====

The opening of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; is obtained by the erosion of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot;, followed by dilation of the resulting image by &quot;B&quot;:

: formula_14

The opening is also given by formula_15, which means that it is the locus of translations of the structuring element &quot;B&quot; inside the image &quot;A&quot;. In the case of the square of side 10, and a disc of radius 2 as the structuring element, the opening is a square of side 10 with rounded corners, where the corner radius is 2.

Example application: Let&#x27;s assume someone has written a note on a non-soaking paper and that the writing looks as if it is growing tiny hairy roots all over. Opening essentially removes the outer tiny &quot;hairline&quot; leaks and restores the text. The side effect is that it rounds off things. The sharp edges start to disappear.

==== Closing ====

The closing of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot; is obtained by the dilation of &quot;A&quot; by &quot;B&quot;, followed by erosion of the resulting structure by &quot;B&quot;:

: formula_16

The closing can also be obtained by formula_17, where &quot;X&quot;&quot;c&quot; denotes the complement of &quot;X&quot; relative to &quot;E&quot; (that is, formula_18). The above means that the closing is the complement of the locus of translations of the symmetric of the structuring element outside the image &quot;A&quot;.

==== Properties of the basic operators ====

Here are some properties of the basic binary morphological operators (dilation, erosion, opening and closing):

* They are translation invariant.
* They are increasing, that is, if formula_19, then formula_20, and formula_21, etc.
* The dilation is commutative: formula_22 .
* If the origin of &quot;E&quot; belongs to the structuring element &quot;B&quot;, then formula_23.
* The dilation is associative, i.e., formula_24. Moreover, the erosion satisfies formula_25.
* Erosion and dilation satisfy the duality formula_26.
* Opening and closing satisfy the duality formula_27.
* The dilation is distributive over set union
* The erosion is distributive over set intersection
* The dilation is a pseudo-inverse of the erosion, and vice versa, in the following sense: formula_28 if and only if formula_29.
* Opening and closing are idempotent.
* Opening is anti-extensive, i.e., formula_30, whereas the closing is &quot;extensive&quot;, i.e., formula_31.

=== Other operators and tools ===

* Hit-or-miss transform
* Pruning transform
* Morphological skeleton
* Filtering by reconstruction
* Ultimate erosions and conditional bisectors
* Granulometry
* Geodesic distance functions

==Grayscale morphology==

In grayscale morphology, images are functions mapping a Euclidean space or grid &quot;E&quot; into formula_32, where formula_33 is the set of reals, formula_34 is an element larger than any real number, and formula_35 is an element smaller than any real number.

Grayscale structuring elements are also functions of the same format, called &quot;structuring functions&quot;.

Denoting an image by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) the structuring function by &quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and the support of &quot;b&quot; by &quot;B&quot;, the grayscale dilation of &quot;f&quot; by &quot;b&quot; is given by

: formula_36

where &quot;sup&quot; denotes the supremum.

Similarly, the erosion of &quot;f&quot; by &quot;b&quot; is given by

: formula_37

where &quot;inf&quot; denotes the infimum.

Just like in binary morphology, the opening and closing are given respectively by

: formula_38

: formula_39

===Flat structuring functions===

It is common to use flat structuring elements in morphological applications. Flat structuring functions are functions &quot;b&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in the form

: formula_40

where formula_41.

In this case, the dilation and erosion are greatly simplified, and given respectively by

: formula_42

: formula_43

In the bounded, discrete case (&quot;E&quot; is a grid and &quot;B&quot; is bounded), the supremum and infimum operators can be replaced by the maximum and minimum. Thus, dilation and erosion are particular cases of order statistics filters, with dilation returning the maximum value within a moving window (the symmetric of the structuring function support &quot;B&quot;), and the erosion returning the minimum value within the moving window &quot;B&quot;.

In the case of flat structuring element, the morphological operators depend only on the relative ordering of pixel values, regardless their numerical values, and therefore are especially suited to the processing of binary images and grayscale images whose light transfer function is not known.

=== Other operators and tools ===

* Morphological gradients
* Top-hat transform
* Watershed algorithm

By combining these operators one can obtain algorithms for many image processing tasks, such as feature detection, image segmentation, image sharpening, image filtering, and classification.
Along this line one should also look into Continuous Morphology

==Mathematical morphology on complete lattices==

Complete lattices are partially ordered sets, where every subset has an infimum and a supremum. In particular, it contains a least element and a greatest element (also denoted &quot;universe&quot;).

===Adjunctions (dilation and erosion)===

Let formula_44 be a complete lattice, with infimum and supremum symbolized by formula_45 and formula_46, respectively. Its universe and least element are symbolized by &quot;U&quot; and formula_47, respectively. Moreover, let formula_48 be a collection of elements from &quot;L&quot;.

A dilation is any operator formula_49 that distributes over the supremum, and preserves the least element. I.e.:
* formula_50,
* formula_51.

An erosion is any operator formula_52 that distributes over the infimum, and preserves the universe. I.e.:
* formula_53,
* formula_54.

Dilations and erosions form Galois connections. That is, for every dilation formula_55 there is one and only one erosion formula_56 that satisfies

: formula_57

for all formula_58.

Similarly, for every erosion there is one and only one dilation satisfying the above connection.

Furthermore, if two operators satisfy the connection, then formula_55 must be a dilation, and formula_56 an erosion.

Pairs of erosions and dilations satisfying the above connection are called &quot;adjunctions&quot;, and the erosion is said to be the adjoint erosion of the dilation, and vice versa.

===Opening and closing===

For every adjunction formula_61, the morphological opening formula_62 and morphological closing formula_63 are defined as follows:

: formula_64

: formula_65

The morphological opening and closing are particular cases of algebraic opening (or simply opening) and algebraic closing (or simply closing). Algebraic openings are operators in &quot;L&quot; that are idempotent, increasing, and anti-extensive. Algebraic closings are operators in &quot;L&quot; that are idempotent, increasing, and extensive.

===Particular cases===

Binary morphology is a particular case of lattice morphology, where &quot;L&quot; is the power set of &quot;E&quot; (Euclidean space or grid), that is, &quot;L&quot; is the set of all subsets of &quot;E&quot;, and formula_66 is the set inclusion. In this case, the infimum is set intersection, and the supremum is set union.

Similarly, grayscale morphology is another particular case, where &quot;L&quot; is the set of functions mapping &quot;E&quot; into formula_32, and formula_66, formula_46, and formula_45, are the point-wise order, supremum, and infimum, respectively. That is, is &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are functions in &quot;L&quot;, then formula_71 if and only if formula_72; the infimum formula_73 is given by formula_74; and the supremum formula_75 is given by formula_76.

<doc id="312813" wikidata="Q1665382" url="?curid=312813" title="Vin Mariani">
<text>Vin Mariani (French: &quot;Mariani wine&quot;) was a coca wine and patent medicine created in the 1860s by Angelo Mariani, a French chemist from the island of Corsica. Mariani became intrigued with coca and its medical and economic potential after reading Paolo Mantegazza&#x27;s paper on the effects of coca. Between 1863 and 1868 Mariani started marketing a coca wine called Vin Tonique Mariani (à la Coca du Pérou) which was made from Bordeaux wine and coca leaves.

The ethanol in the wine acted as a solvent and extracted the cocaine from the coca leaves. It originally contained 6 mg of cocaine per fluid ounce of wine (211.2 mg/L), but Vin Mariani that was to be exported contained 7.2 mg per ounce (253.4 mg/L), in order to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the United States. Advertisements for Vin Mariani claimed that it would restore health, strength, energy and vitality.

== Promotion and testimonials ==
Mariani marketed Vin Mariani for a number of ailments, touting its ability to increase energy, appetite and mood. It was promoted as a performance enhancer for creatives and athletes alike, and was endorsed by many notable people of its time. Mariani solicited testimonials from a broad range of European celebrities, including members of various royal families, politicians, artists, writers and other household names, and reprinted them in newspapers and magazines as advertisements. He claimed to have collected over four thousand such endorsements.

Pope Leo XIII and later Pope Pius X were both Vin Mariani drinkers. Pope Leo appeared on a poster endorsing the wine and awarded a Vatican gold medal to Mariani for creating it. Thomas Edison claimed it helped him stay awake longer. Ulysses S. Grant drank Vin Mariani while writing his memoirs towards the end of his life. Jules Méline, the French prime minister, drank the wine despite being otherwise anti-alcohol.

Other notables who endorsed Vin Mariani include Kyrle Bellew, Émile Zola, Victorien Sardou, Henri Rochefort and Charles Gounod, all of whom wrote testimonials that appeared as Vin Mariani advertisements. Actresses, dancers, and singers, including Adelina Patti, Emma Albani, Sarah Bernhardt, Emma Eames, Rosita Mauri, Lillian Russell, Emma Juch, Louise Paullin, Zélie de Lussan, Marie Tempest, Madeleine Lucette Ryley, and Augusta Holmès also endorsed Vin Mariani in print testimonials.

== Inspiration for Coca-Cola ==
Vin Mariani was apparently an inspiration for John S. Pemberton&#x27;s 1885 coca wine drink, Pemberton&#x27;s French Wine Coca. Pemberton&#x27;s recipe was very similar to that of Vin Mariani, including the coca leaves. It was differentiated only by the inclusion of the African kola nut, the beverage&#x27;s source of caffeine. Later that year, when Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia, passed prohibition legislation, Pemberton responded by developing a carbonated, non-alcoholic version of his French Wine Coca. He called the reformulated beverage Coca-Cola, for its stimulant ingredients coca leaves and kola nuts.

== Modern developments ==
Angelo Mariani failed to pass his recipe down to subsequent Mariani family generations, so Vin Mariani went out of production after his death. The product was relaunched in 2014 by Christophe Mariani (no relation). Christophe Mariani subsequently met the Bolivian president, Evo Morales, in Rome to discuss the commercialisation of Mariani cocaine in Bolivia.

<text>Transport in [[Oradea]] is provided by a network of public transport operating trams and buses, as well as roads. Tram and bus services are run by Oradea Transport Local S.A. (commonly known as OTL).

==Roads==
==Tram==
There are three tram lines in Oradea, and these run together for most of their journey. The lines are 1, 2 and 3. Lines 1 and 3 run together in a city loop, while Line 2 joins part of this loop in part of its journey. All quarters except Vie are served by trams. Trams do not actually run in the city centre, since this is a historic area with narrow streets. They do, however, run on the border of the city in a loop, and then continue through to all the residential areas and quarters.

* Line 1 (1 red, 1R [Roşu], and 1 black, 1N [Negru] (completes the circuit the other way around)) runs from Sinteza Factory, which is located in the industrial west of Oradea, very close to the township of Borş and the Hungarian border, via the quarter of Rogerius, the central railway station, the city centre and then loops back to Rogerius.
* Line 2 runs from Ioșia quarter via the southern city centre and the heart of the city (Unirii Square) to Cantemir quarter and then Nufărul.
* Line 3 (3 red, 3R [Roşu], and 3 black, 3N [Negru]) (completes the circuit the other way around)) runs from Nufărul and then does the city loop from the Civic Centre onwards, terminating back at the Civic Centre near the main market.

Line 3 was called Line 4 before 2004, and there was no route named Line 3. However, in order to make the line order more logical, Line 4 was renamed Line 3 in 2004.

In 2008 and 2009 10 new Siemens ULF trams were introduced to the Oradea tram system. The first Siemens tram was put in service in April 2008.

In 2018, Oradea took delivery of 10 Tatra KT4D trams from the Berlin transport operator BVG.

The 10th European Tramdriver Championship was held in the city on the 3rd June 2023.

<text>This article contains a list of magic tricks. In magic literature, tricks are often called effects. Based on published literature and marketed effects, there are millions of effects; a short performance routine by a single magician may contain dozens of such effects.

Some students of magic strive to refer to effects using a proper name, and also to properly attribute an effect to its creator. For example, consider an effect in which a magician shows four aces, and then the aces turn face up one at a time in a mysterious fashion. This effect, recognized as &quot;Twisting the Aces&quot;, is attributed to Dai Vernon, and it is based on a false count invented by Alex Elmsley. Some tricks are listed merely with their marketed name (particularly those sold as stand-alone tricks by retail dealers), whereas others are listed by the name given within magic publications.

<doc id="312833" wikidata="Q305896" url="?curid=312833" title="Dots per inch">
<text>Dots per inch (DPI, or dpi) is a measure of spatial printing, video or image scanner dot density, in particular the number of individual dots that can be placed in a line within the span of . Similarly, dots per millimetre (d/mm or dpmm) refers to the number of individual dots that can be placed within a line of .

== DPI measurement in printing ==

DPI is used to describe the resolution number of dots per inch in a digital print and the printing resolution of a hard copy print dot gain, which is the increase in the size of the halftone dots during printing. This is caused by the spreading of ink on the surface of the media.

Up to a point, printers with higher DPI produce clearer and more detailed output. A printer does not necessarily have a single DPI measurement; it is dependent on print mode, which is usually influenced by driver settings. The range of DPI supported by a printer is most dependent on the print head technology it uses. A dot matrix printer, for example, applies ink via tiny rods striking an ink ribbon, and has a relatively low resolution, typically in the range of . An inkjet printer sprays ink through tiny nozzles, and is typically capable of 300–720 DPI. A laser printer applies toner through a controlled electrostatic charge, and may be in the range of 600 to 2,400 DPI.

The DPI measurement of a printer often needs to be considerably higher than the pixels per inch (PPI) measurement of a video display in order to produce similar-quality output. This is due to the limited range of colours for each dot typically available on a printer. At each dot position, the simplest type of color printer can either print no dot, or print a dot consisting of a fixed volume of ink in each of four color channels (typically CMYK with cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink) or 24 = 16 colours on laser, wax and most inkjet printers, of which only 14 or 15 (or as few as 8 or 9) may be actually discernible depending on the strength of the black component, the strategy used for overlaying and combining it with the other colours, and whether it is in &quot;color&quot; mode.

Higher-end inkjet printers can offer 5, 6 or 7 ink colours giving 32, 64 or 128 possible tones per dot location (and again, it can be that not all combinations will produce a unique result). Contrast this to a standard sRGB monitor where each pixel produces 256 intensities of light in each of three channels (RGB).

While some color printers can produce variable drop volumes at each dot position, and may use additional ink-color channels, the number of colours is still typically less than on a monitor. Most printers must therefore produce additional colours through a halftone or dithering process, and rely on their base resolution being high enough to &quot;fool&quot; the human observer&#x27;s eye into perceiving a patch of a single smooth colour.

The exception to this rule is dye-sublimation printers, which can apply a much more variable amount of dye—close to or exceeding the number of the 256 levels per channel available on a typical monitor—to each &quot;pixel&quot; on the page without dithering, but with other limitations:
* lower spatial resolution (typically 200 to 300 dpi), which can make text and lines look somewhat rough
* lower output speed (a single page requiring three or four complete passes, one for each dye colour, each of which may take more than fifteen seconds—generally quicker, however, than most inkjet printers&#x27; &quot;photo&quot; modes)
* a wasteful (and, for confidential documents, insecure) dye-film roll cartridge system
* occasional color registration errors (mainly along the long axis of the page), which necessitate recalibrating the printer to account for slippage and drift in the paper feed system.

These disadvantages mean that, despite their marked superiority in producing good photographic and non-linear diagrammatic output, dye-sublimation printers remain niche products, and thus other devices using higher resolution, lower color depth, and dither patterns remain the norm.

This dithered printing process could require a region of four to six dots (measured across each side) to accurately reproduce the color in a single pixel. An image that is 100 pixels wide may need to be 400 to 600 dots in width in the printed output; if a 100 × 100-pixel image is to be printed in a one-inch square, the printer must be capable of 400 to 600 dots per inch to reproduce the image. As such, 600 dpi (sometimes 720) is now the typical output resolution of entry-level laser printers and some utility inkjet printers, with 1,200–1,440 and 2,400–2,880 being common &quot;high&quot; resolutions. This contrasts with the 300–360 (or 240) dpi of early models, and the approximate 200 dpi of dot-matrix printers and fax machines, which gave faxed and computer-printed documents—especially those that made heavy use of graphics or coloured block text—a characteristic &quot;digitized&quot; appearance, because of their coarse, obvious dither patterns, inaccurate colours, loss of clarity in photographs, and jagged (&quot;aliased&quot;) edges on some text and line art.

===DPI or PPI in digital image files===

In printing, DPI (dots per inch) refers to the output resolution of a printer or imagesetter, and PPI (pixels per inch) refers to the input resolution of a photograph or image.
&quot;DPI&quot; refers to the physical dot density of an image when it is reproduced as a real physical entity, for example printed onto paper. A digitally stored image has no inherent physical dimensions, measured in inches or centimetres. Some digital file formats record a DPI value, or more commonly a PPI (pixels per inch) value, which is to be used when printing the image. This number lets the printer or software know the intended size of the image, or in the case of scanned images, the size of the original scanned object. For example, a bitmap image may measure 1,000 × 1,000 pixels, a resolution of 1 megapixel. If it is labelled as 250 PPI, that is an instruction to the printer to print it at a size of 4 × 4 inches. Changing the PPI to 100 in an image editing program would tell the printer to print it at a size of 10 × 10 inches. However, changing the PPI value would not change the size of the image in pixels which would still be 1,000 × 1,000. An image may also be resampled to change the number of pixels and therefore the size or resolution of the image, but this is quite different from simply setting a new PPI for the file.

For vector images, since the file is resolution independent, there is no need to resample the image before resizing it as it prints equally well at all sizes. However, there is still a target printing size. Some image formats, such as Photoshop format, can contain both bitmap and vector data in the same file. Adjusting the PPI in a Photoshop file will change the intended printing size of the bitmap portion of the data and also change the intended printing size of the vector data to match. This way the vector and bitmap data maintain a consistent size relationship when the target printing size is changed. Text stored as outline fonts in bitmap image formats is handled in the same way. Other formats, such as PDF, are primarily vector formats that can contain images, potentially at a mixture of resolutions. In these formats the target PPI of the bitmaps is adjusted to match when the target print size of the file is changed. This is the converse of how it works in a primarily bitmap format like Photoshop, but has exactly the same result of maintaining the relationship between the vector and bitmap portions of the data.

==Computer monitor DPI standards==
Since the 1980s, Macs have set the default display &quot;DPI&quot; to 72 PPI, while the Microsoft Windows operating system has used a default of 96 PPI. These default specifications arose out of the problems rendering standard fonts in the early display systems of the 1980s, including the IBM-based CGA, EGA, VGA and 8514 displays as well as the Macintosh displays featured in the 128K computer and its successors. The choice of 72 PPI by Macintosh for their displays arose from existing convention: the official 72 &quot;points per inch&quot; mirrored the 72 &quot;pixels per inch&quot; that appeared on their display screens. (Points are a physical unit of measure in typography, dating from the days of printing presses, where 1 point by the modern definition is of the international inch (25.4 mm), which therefore makes 1 point approximately 0.0139 in or 352.8 μm). Thus, the 72 pixels per inch seen on the display had exactly the same physical dimensions as the 72 points per inch later seen on a printout, with 1 pt in printed text equal to 1 px on the display screen. As it is, the Macintosh 128K featured a screen measuring 512 pixels in width by 342 pixels in height, and this corresponded to the width of standard office paper (512 px ÷ 72 px/in ≈ 7.1 in, with a 0.7 in margin down each side when assuming in × 11 in North American paper size; in the rest of the world, it is 210 mm × 297 mm – called A4. B5 is 176 mm × 250 mm).

A consequence of Apple&#x27;s decision was that the widely used 10-point fonts from the typewriter era had to be allotted 10 display pixels in em height, and 5 display pixels in &quot;x-height&quot;. This is technically described as 10 &quot;pixels per em&quot; (&quot;PPEm&quot;). This made 10-point fonts be rendered crudely and made them difficult to read on the display screen, particularly the lowercase characters. Furthermore, there was the consideration that computer screens are typically viewed (at a desk) at a distance 30% greater than printed materials, causing a mismatch between the perceived sizes seen on the computer screen and those on the printouts.

Microsoft tried to solve both problems with a hack that has had long-term consequences for the understanding of what DPI and PPI mean. Microsoft began writing its software to treat the screen as though it provided a PPI characteristic that is of what the screen actually displayed. Because most screens at the time provided around 72 PPI, Microsoft essentially wrote its software to assume that every screen provides 96 PPI (because 72 × = 96). The short-term gain of this trickery was twofold:
* It would seem to the software that one-third more pixels were available for rendering an image, thereby allowing for bitmap fonts to be created with greater detail.
* On every screen that actually provided 72 PPI, each graphical element (such as a character of text) would be rendered at a size one third larger than it &quot;should&quot; be, thereby allowing a person to sit a comfortable distance from the screen. However, larger graphical elements meant less screen space was available for programs to draw. Indeed, the default 720-pixel wide mode of a Hercules mono graphics adaptor (the one-time gold standard for high resolution PC graphics) – or a &quot;tweaked&quot; VGA adaptor – provided an apparent -inch page width at this resolution. However, the more common and colour-capable display adaptors of the time all provided a 640-pixel wide image in their high resolution modes, enough for a bare inches at 100% zoom, with barely any greater visible page &quot;height&quot; – a maximum of 5 inches, versus . Consequently, the default margins in Microsoft Word were set, &quot;and still remain&quot; at 1 full inch on all sides of the page, keeping the &quot;text width&quot; for standard size printer paper within visible limits; despite most computer monitors now being both larger and finer-pitched, and printer paper transports having become more sophisticated, the Mac-standard half-inch borders remain listed in Word 2010&#x27;s page layout presets as the &quot;narrow&quot; option (versus the 1-inch default).
* Without using supplemental, software-provided zoom levels, the 1:1 relationship between display and print size was (deliberately) lost; the availability of different-sized, user-adjustable monitors and display adaptors with varying output resolutions exacerbated this, as it was not possible to rely on a properly-adjusted &quot;standard&quot; monitor and adaptor having a known PPI. For example, a 12-inch Hercules monitor and adaptor with a thick bezel and a little underscan may offer 90 &quot;physical&quot; PPI, with the displayed image appearing nearly identical to hardcopy (assuming the H-scan density was properly adjusted to give square pixels) but a thin-bezel 14-inch VGA monitor adjusted to give a borderless display may be closer to 60, with the same bitmap image thus appearing 50% larger; yet, someone with an 8514 (&quot;XGA&quot;) adaptor and the same monitor could achieve 100 DPI using its 1024-pixel wide mode and adjusting the image to be underscanned. A user who wanted to directly compare on-screen elements against those on an existing printed page by holding it up against the monitor would therefore first need to determine the correct zoom level to use, largely by trial and error, and often not be able to obtain an exact match in programs that only allowed integer per cent settings, or even fixed pre-programmed zoom levels. For the examples above, they may need to use respectively 94% (precisely, 93.75) – or , 63% (62.5) – or ; and 104% (104.167) – or , with the more commonly accessible 110% actually being a less precise match.

Thus, for example, a 10-point font on a Macintosh (at 72 PPI) was represented with 10 pixels (i.e., 10 PPEm), whereas a 10-point font on a Windows platform (at 96 PPI) at the same zoom level is represented with 13 pixels (i.e., Microsoft rounded to 13 pixels, or 13 PPEm) – and, on a typical consumer grade monitor, would have physically appeared around to inch high instead of . Likewise, a 12-point font was represented with 12 pixels on a Macintosh, and 16 pixels (or a physical display height of maybe inch) on a Windows platform at the same zoom, and so on. The negative consequence of this standard is that with 96 PPI displays, there is no longer a one-to-one relationship between the font size in pixels and the printout size in points. This difference is accentuated on more recent displays that feature higher pixel densities. This has been less of a problem with the advent of vector graphics and fonts being used in place of bitmap graphics and fonts. Moreover, many Windows software programs have been written since the 1980s which assume that the screen provides 96 PPI. Accordingly, these programs do not display properly at common alternative resolutions such as 72 PPI or 120 PPI. The solution has been to introduce two concepts:
* logical PPI: The PPI that software claims a screen provides. This can be thought of as the PPI provided by a virtual screen created by the operating system.
* physical PPI: The PPI that a physical screen actually provides.
Software programs render images to the virtual screen and then the operating system renders the virtual screen onto the physical screen. With a logical PPI of 96 PPI, older programs can still run properly regardless of the actual physical PPI of the display screen, although they may exhibit some visual distortion thanks to the effective 133.3% pixel zoom level (requiring either that every third pixel be doubled in width/height, or heavy-handed smoothing be employed).

===How Microsoft Windows handles DPI scaling===

Displays with high pixel densities were not common up to the Windows XP era. High DPI displays became mainstream around the time Windows 8 was released. Display scaling by entering a custom DPI irrespective of the display resolution has been a feature of Microsoft Windows since Windows 95. Windows XP introduced the GDI+ library which allows resolution-independent text scaling. In Microsoft Windows, the DPI higher than 96 DPI is called High DPI.

Windows Vista introduced support for programs to declare themselves to the OS that they are high-DPI aware via a manifest file or using an API. For programs that do not declare themselves as DPI-aware, Windows Vista supports a compatibility feature called DPI virtualization so system metrics and UI elements are presented to applications as if they are running at 96 DPI and the Desktop Window Manager then scales the resulting application window to match the DPI setting. Windows Vista retains the Windows XP style scaling option which when enabled turns off DPI virtualization for all applications globally. DPI virtualization is a compatibility option as application developers are all expected to update their apps to support high DPI without relying on DPI virtualization.

Windows Vista also introduces Windows Presentation Foundation. WPF .NET applications are vector-based, not pixel-based and are designed to be resolution-independent. Developers using the old GDI API and Windows Forms on .NET Framework runtime need to update their apps to be DPI aware and flag their applications as DPI-aware.

Windows 7 adds the ability to change the DPI by doing only a log off, not a full reboot and makes it a per-user setting. Additionally, Windows 7 reads the pixel density related information from the EDID and automatically sets the system DPI value to match the monitor&#x27;s physical pixel density, unless the effective resolution is less than 1024 × 768. Also, Windows 7 adds DirectWrite that optimised for monitors that larger than 1080p.

In Windows 8, only the DPI scaling percentage is shown in the DPI changing dialog and the display of the raw DPI value has been removed. In Windows 8.1, the global setting to disable DPI virtualization (only use XP-style scaling) is removed and a per-app setting added for the user to disable DPI virtualization from the Compatibility tab. When the DPI scaling setting is set to be higher than 120 PPI (125%), DPI virtualization is enabled for all applications unless the application opts out of it by specifying a DPI aware flag (manifest) as &quot;true&quot; inside the EXE. Windows 8.1 retains a per-application option to disable DPI virtualization of an app. Windows 8.1 also adds the ability for different displays to use independent DPI scaling factors, although it calculates this automatically for each display and turns on DPI virtualization for all monitors at any scaling level.

Windows 10 adds manual control over DPI scaling for individual monitors.

==Proposed metrication==
There are some ongoing efforts to abandon the DPI Image resolution unit in favour of a metric unit, giving the inter-dot spacing in dots per centimetre (px/cm or dpcm), as used in CSS3 media queries or micrometres (μm) between dots. A resolution of 72 DPI, for example, equals a resolution of about 28 dpcm or an inter-dot spacing of about 353 μm.

<doc id="312836" wikidata="Q2720436" url="?curid=312836" title="Cups and balls">
<text>The cups and balls is a performance of magic with innumerable adaptations. Street gambling variations performed by conmen were known as Bunco Booths. A typical cups and balls routine includes many of the most fundamental effects of magic: the balls can vanish, appear, transpose, reappear and transform. Basic skills, such as misdirection, manual dexterity, sleight of hand, and audience management are also essential to most cups and balls routines. As a result, mastery of the cups and balls is considered by many as the litmus test of a magician&#x27;s skill with gimmick style tricks. Magician John Mulholland wrote that Harry Houdini had expressed the opinion that no one could be considered an accomplished magician until he had mastered the cups and balls. Professor Hoffman called the cups and balls &quot;the groundwork of all legerdemain&quot;.

Instead of cups, other types of covers can be used, such as bowls or hats. The shell game con is a rogue variant of the cups and balls used as a confidence trick.

==History==
The effect, also known as &quot;acetabula et calculi&quot;, was performed by Roman conjurers as far back as two thousand years ago, as referred to in Seneca&#x27;s 45th Epistle to Lucilius:
One popularly circulated picture, thought to date from 2500 B.C. from the walls of a burial chamber in Beni Hasan, Egypt, shows two men kneeling over four inverted bowls. It was taken by early Egyptologists Wilkinson and Newberry as evidence that the cups and balls effect, or its related deceptive gambling game, thimblerig, possibly dates back to Ancient Egypt. Because of its context, modern Egyptologists regard the image as a game using pots or cups but details of the game are unknown. The illustration is unique in ancient Egyptian art, so whether or not the game utilizes sleight of hand trickery may never be known unless a future discovery produces a similar image in a more explanatory context.

==Performance and variations==

The most widely performed version of the effect uses three cups and three small balls. The magician makes the balls appear to pass through the solid bottoms of the cups, jump from cup to cup, disappear from the cup and appear in other places, or vanish from various places and reappear under the cups (sometimes under the same cup), often ending with larger objects, such as fruit, larger balls, small animals such as baby chicks, or a combination of the different final loads. Many magicians use fruit, as each one is different in shape and size, thus increasing the element of surprise.

===Basic routine===
Starting with three cups set down in a line with three balls visible, one of the balls is put on top of the centre cup and the other two cups nested above. With a tap of the wand, the three cups are lifted, revealing that the ball has &quot;penetrated&quot; the cup. Again the cups are set in a line, the middle cup covering the ball which has already penetrated. Another of the visible balls is placed on top of the centre cup and covered with the other two cups, the cups being tapped and lifted to show the second ball has penetrated. This is repeated with the third ball.

===Medieval cups and balls===
In 1584 Reginald Scot wrote &quot;The Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot;, within which he describes tricks with balls. He recommends using candlesticks with a hollow underneath, or bowls, or salt cellars covers to cover the balls. He describes the routine with three or four balls, and as many covers. He describes placing a ball under each cover, lifting the covers to show the balls vanished, and then having the balls all re-appear under one cover. Although Scot describes a method, it is considered by magicians to be unlikely as some of the moves described would be impossible to perform invisibly.

===Indian cups and balls===
In India, the cups and balls were performed seated on the ground, with an audience stood, or in chairs around the performer. This unique line of sight for the audience gave rise to some unique sleight of hand moves. The cups that are used are shaped like a shallow bell, a shallow bowl with a small knob handle on the top. They are often held between the first two fingers by this handle. The shallow nature of the cups means that a large item cannot be produced at the end of the routine, so the routine is often ended with the production of many of the same sized balls, although Shankar Junior would end with the production of black powder from one of the bowls. The number of cups and balls used varies, with between one and five balls in play during the routine, and between two and four cups.

===Owan To Tama===
Owan To Tama, the &quot;Turning of Bowls&quot; is the Japanese version of the cups and balls. The magician uses three bowls, and traditionally four soft silk covered balls, a fan and three final productions, either oranges or boxes, sometimes of cigarettes. The movements of the Japanese routine are based on Japanese classical dance. There is a display to show the bowls used called &quot;Owan-Gaeshi&quot; where the performer passes the bowls from hand to hand, showing them empty in a dance-like manner. The routine has been described as having a reverent, ceremonial air. The routine was also performed kneeling on the floor, for a kneeling audience. Unlike other cups and balls routines the Japanese magician would usually work inside, and to music.

===&quot;Bean sowing&quot;===
The Chinese routine of the cups and balls is often called &quot;The Immortal Sowing Beans&quot; and originated in ancient agricultural society prior to the Shang dynasty 1046BCE), It takes its name from the saying &quot;Plant melons and you get melons; sow beans and you get beans&quot;.

The props used consisted of a fan, a mat, between two and six bowls, and between three and ten beans. The most common variant used two bowls with either three or five beans. The Chinese method is unusual in that an extra bean or ball is rarely used, and it employs atypical methods of concealing the beans. Traditionally the routine was performed on the ground, but in present times it is more commonly performed on a table.

Another typical element of the Chinese routine is to both begin and end the performance in dramatic fashion. Common routines include changing a small peach into an egg, producing water (sometimes with fish), or producing Baijiu. The finale &quot;Harvesting a Million Beans&quot; involves placing two bowls mouth to mouth one on top of the other, then, when the top bowl is slowly lifted from the bottom bowl (which may have contained, ,only water before) the lower bowl is seemingly overflowing with (&quot;a million&quot;) tiny beans. While, as with the Indian routine, the Chinese do not always conclude this performance in dramatic fashion, one performer that is known to is 王鬼手 (&quot;Wang Gui Shou&quot;), whose name means &quot;king of ghost hands&quot;.

===Modern cups and balls: the Dai Vernon routine===
The cups and balls have a long history, and the routines performed by today&#x27;s performers are built upon the work of previous masters. In ancient Greece and Rome magicians would perform standing behind a table, as opposed to on the ground as seen in Egypt, India and Turkey, to allow a larger audience to see the show, and this tradition has continued today. Tall conical shaped metal cups were the norm in Europe and Egypt until the routine by Dai Vernon became popular using shorter, more squat cups that were about as tall as the hand. Similar squat cups were popularised by the likes of Paul Fox, Charlie Miller and Ross Bertram.

Dai Vernon&#x27;s influence can be seen in many modern routines. Jim Cellini, a student of Tony Slydini and teacher of many street performers, credits his routine to Vernon, Miller, and Johnny Fox. Dai Vernon&#x27;s student, Michael Ammar, of whom Louis Falanga, President of L&amp;L Publishing, said: &quot;Ammar has literally led the industry in shaping the thinking and performing of this generation of magicians&quot;, created his own routine based upon what his teacher had taught him.

The Vernon routine consists of vanishing the three balls, to reappear under the cups, the penetration of the balls through the cups, the spectator choosing which cup to invisibly transport a ball to, the removal and return of the balls, and the revelation of the final large production items, usually fruit. Watching a modern performance of cups and balls, one is likely to see a similar sequence followed.

===Chop cup===
A fairly modern development is the &#x27;chop cup&#x27;. This cup was invented around 1954 by Al Wheatley who performed a Chinese-costumed act with the name &quot;Chop Chop&quot;. The chop cup is a variation with one cup and (seemingly) one ball, hugely popular because it requires only a very small flat area to perform, unlike the considerable table space needed for the classic three-cup routine. The Chicago close-up magician Don Alan performed his streamlined chop cup routine on television. and was immediately copied by magicians all over the world. Paul Daniels&#x27; routine with the chop cup has also done a lot for the routine&#x27;s popularity. The chop cup can be handled entirely by the top, creating a more seemingly impossible performance.

===Three shell game===

The three shell game is similar in some respects to the three cup routine. In it, the main move is a steal of the pea from the back of the shell. This is achieved by using a flexible pea and performing the trick on a soft surface. The pea is squeezed out under the back of the shell into the fingers in the act of pushing the shell forward. In a similar way, the pea can be introduced under a shell by drawing it back. These moves are made casually in swapping the positions of the shells. The spectator is supposed to follow by eye which shell has the pea, but in reality, they have no chance of success as the performer is always one step ahead of the spectators.

===Clear Cups===

====Penn &amp; Teller====
The magic duo Penn &amp; Teller performs a version of the cups and balls trick in their act. Initially, they perform the trick with small aluminum foil balls and plastic cups. The trick ends with the appearance of larger foil balls under the cups, and the surprise appearance of an extra unrelated object, such as a potato or a lime, under one or more cups. They then repeat the trick using transparent plastic cups, claiming that they will reveal how to perform the trick. However, as part of the joke, they do the trick so fast as to make it difficult to follow. They claim that this version of the cups and balls breaks all four rules of magic: not to tell the audience how a trick is done, not to repeat the same trick twice, not to show the audience the secret preparation, and the &quot;unwritten rule&quot; never to perform the cups and balls with clear plastic cups.

====Latimer Clear Cups and Balls====
The Latimer Clear Cups And Balls is an illusion, created and performed by American illusionist Jason Latimer. In this version of the &quot;follow the ball&quot; cups and balls game, the magician uses clear glass cups and the audience can watch as the balls visually vanish and jump to underneath another cup. The effect was debuted by Jason Latimer in 2003 at International Federation of Magic Societies (FISM), and on US television on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; in 2004.

<text>Sporting Life is a sporting retailer shop based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Sporting Life sells sporting goods specially made for runners, cyclers, skiers, snowboarders, and hikers.

==History==
Sporting Life was founded in 1979 as a privately owned company by David and Patti Russell (husband and wife), and Brian McGrath. The three co-founders are enthusiast skiers at a private club and are actively involved in picking merchandise, with Mr. Russell into sports equipment, Ms. Russell to fashion; and Mr. McGrath focused on footwear. As of 2011, there were 270 full-time staff and 600 employees. Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited bought a 75% share in the company in late 2011, with the founders retaining the remaining balance of shares.

Sporting Life originally had four locations until their 2014 expansion. Their flagship store is located at 2665 Yonge Street, just south of Lawrence Avenue, and it contains 36,000 square feet over two stories, having been recently expanded in 2011. Their 2454 Yonge Street location sells mainly bikes and snowboards, with a limited selection of apparel. They also have a 42,000-square-foot anchor space at Sherway Gardens, which relocated to a new wing in 2015 as part of the mall&#x27;s expansion and renovation, while the original location was replaced by Nordstrom in 2017. There is also a 10,000-square-foot location in Collingwood, situated near Blue Mountain, which was initially their only store outside Toronto.

In 2008, Sporting Life launched its e-commerce website.

===Expansion===

The co-founders of Sporting Life sold a 75% stake to Fairfax Financial in late 2011 in order to fund the retailer&#x27;s expansion. The plan was to open two stores a year, with suggested locations in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, and Montreal, each store being in the 30,000-50,000 square foot range.

Sporting Life&#x27;s fifth and sixth locations opened in 2014, the first time in 14 years that they had opened a new store. Sporting Life had bought Ottawa-based Tommy &amp; Lefebvre on June 25, 2013, and moved their staff from the Bank Street location to their new store at a reconstructed Lansdowne Park in October 2014. Another Sporting Life opened at the newly renovated Markville in September 2014, replacing a Sport Chek.

Sporting Life opened their seventh store at Hillcrest Mall in spring 2016, on the site of the former The Bay &quot;Men&#x27;s Store and Home&quot; store; after The Bay had consolidated its two separate mall locations into a newly expanded central space. Two more stores opened in 2017; one at Yorkdale Shopping Centre in part of the space previously occupied by Sears Canada, and another at Calgary&#x27;s CF Market Mall.

In October 2018, Sporting Life opened their first store outside Ontario and Alberta at Quartier Dix30, in Brossard, Quebec.

In November 2019, Sporting Life expanded into British Columbia and opened first store in Greater Vancouver at Brentwood Mall.

In late 2022, Sporting Life opened 3 new stores located at Carrefour Laval Shopping Centre in Laval, Quebec, Mapleview Mall in Burlington, Ontario, and Southgate Mall in Edmonton, Alberta. This will bring their store total to 13 stores plus e-commerce. At maturity, Sporting Life will grow to 18 stores by 2027.

==Clientele==
Sporting Life stocks outerwear, athleticwear, footwear, bikes, skis, snowboards and lifestyle apparel. It carries luxury labels such as Moncler, Nobis, Moose Knuckles and Canada Goose. 

Sporting Life was one of the first North American retailers of Canada Goose. Sporting Life&#x27;s stock includes moderately prices brands like Nike and Adidas as well as catering to an upmarket and enthusiast clientele. This is a differentiator from another Canadian sporting goods retailer, Sport Chek, which caters to a more casual audience as well being common in Canadian shopping plazas and malls. Sporting Life&#x27;s annual sales are reported to be under $200 million but this is unconfirmed as the company is privately held and does not make its financial statements public. Co-founder David Russell suggested that Sport Chek and Sporting Life were not direct competitors, saying “Typically, our price points take over where theirs end”.

Due to its few locations and product selection, Sporting Life has been described by the Toronto Star as a &quot;destination shop&quot;. It is extremely popular during Boxing Day and Black Friday, with huge lineups of customers waiting to enter. Sporting Life is also known for sponsoring the Sporting Life 10K run which starts at its flagship store and takes the route of Yonge Street; the 2013 edition sold out with 27,000 participants raising $2.2 million.

==Sporting Life 10K==
The Sporting Life 10K is an annual 10K running/walking event on Yonge Street in Toronto, that has taken place every May since 2003. Money raised from the Sporting Life 10K goes towards funding Campfire Circle (formerly Camp Ooch &amp; Camp Trillium)– a volunteer-run summer camp to provide enriching experiences to victims of childhood cancer.

27,000 people participated in 2013.

<doc id="312847" wikidata="Q36027" url="?curid=312847" title="Điện Biên Phủ">
<text>Điện Biên Phủ (, ) is a city in the northwestern region of Vietnam. It is the capital of Điện Biên Province. The city is best known for the decisive Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, which occurred during the First Indochina War of independence against France. The region is a center of ethnic Tai culture. In prior history, the city was formerly called Muang Thaeng.

Điện Biên Phủ lies in Mường Thanh Valley, a long and wide basin sometimes described as &quot;heart-shaped.&quot; It is on the western edge of Điện Biên Province, of which it is the capital, and is only about from the border with Laos. 

Until the creation of the province in 2004, Điện Biên Phủ was part of Lai Châu Province. The Vietnamese government elevated Điện Biên Phủ to town status in 1992, and to city status in 2003.

==Demographics==
Statistics on Điện Biên Phủ&#x27;s population vary depending on definitions—figures are generally between 70,000 and 125,000. The city is growing quickly and was projected to have a population of 150,000 by 2020. 

According to statistics from the government, as of 2019, the city had a population of 80,366 people, covering an area of 308.18 km2.

==Transport==
National Route 12 connects Điện Biên to Lai Châu. Điện Biên Phủ Airport serves the city with air route to Hanoi capital and Ho Chi Minh City.

==History==
The 8th century Thai locality of Muang Then is believed to have been centered here.

=== Nineteenth and early twentieth century ===
Điện Biên Phủ was rather politically removed from central Vietnamese control until 1841. In this year, under the Nguyễn dynasty, Điện Biên Phủ was directly incorporated into the Vietnamese political system when they established the town as an administrative district. This was partly done for more direct control of the region and to stop bandits who were exploiting the opium trade.

In 1887, Điện Biên Phủ became a French protectorate. To ensure that the French would control the local opium trade, they appointed a sole administrator to supervise the trade and control the town. Other than a Hmong rebellion in 1918, the town was under French control until the Japanese occupied it during World War II. By early May 1945, the Japanese occupied Điện Biên Phủ and planned to convert it into a large military and logistical base. However, with an airstrip barely being enlarged, Chinese nationalist troops took the town in August of the same year. Subsequently, the nationalist forces then gave way to returning French troops.

===Operation Castor (1953)===

In the 1950s, the town was known for its famous opium traffic, generating 500,000,000 French francs annually. It was also an extensive source of rice for the Việt Minh.

The region was fortified in November 1953 by the French Union force in the biggest airborne operation of the 1946–1954 First Indochina War, Operation Castor, to block Việt Minh transport routes and to set the stage to draw out Việt Minh forces.

===Siege of Điện Biên Phủ (1954)===
The following year, the important Battle of Điện Biên Phủ was fought between the Việt Minh (led by General Võ Nguyên Giáp), and the French Union (led by General Henri Navarre, successor to General Raoul Salan). The siege of the French garrison lasted fifty-seven days, from 17:30, 13 March to 17:30, 7 May 1954. The southern outpost or fire base of &quot;Camp Isabelle&quot; did not follow the cease-fire order and fought until 01:00 the following day. The long-scheduled Geneva Meeting&#x27;s Indochina conference involving the United States, the UK, the French Union and the USSR had already begun on 26 April 1954.

The battle was significant beyond the valleys of Điện Biên Phủ. Giáp&#x27;s victory ended major French involvement in Indochina and led to the Geneva accords which partitioned Vietnam into North and South.

Điện Biên Phủ apparently recovered quickly after the siege. When Wilfred Burchett visited the area in 1962, he found a 5,000-acre state-owned farm growing coffee, cotton, rice, and sugar cane on land that had once been a battleground. For example, the airstrip at Isabelle was now a rice field, and most of the approach trenches used by the Việt Minh had been filled in. The farm manager told him that 1,500 soldiers from 176th regiment arrived in 1958 to cultivate the area, followed by 1,200 volunteers from the Red River Delta, of which 900 were women. During their first season there, they cleared away the leftover land mines and rushed to grow enough crops in time, to the exclusion of other activities. They did not have housing until after the first season; in the meantime, they sheltered with the local Thái tribe, who also gave them extra seeds for growing rice. Burchett claimed he also saw a hospital with 60 beds, some pottery-making facilities, the remains of a French tank and various airplanes, two tombstones dedicated to the two soldiers who blew up said tank, a &quot;modest&quot; monument packed with more tombstones, and a &quot;small museum&quot; filled with homemade weapons used in the battle.

<text>In number theory, a number field &quot;F&quot; is called totally real if for each embedding of &quot;F&quot; into the complex numbers the image lies inside the real numbers. Equivalent conditions are that &quot;F&quot; is generated over Q by one root of an integer polynomial &quot;P&quot;, all of the roots of &quot;P&quot; being real; or that the tensor product algebra of &quot;F&quot; with the real field, over Q, is isomorphic to a tensor power of R.

For example, quadratic fields &quot;F&quot; of degree 2 over Q are either real (and then totally real), or complex, depending on whether the square root of a positive or negative number is adjoined to Q. In the case of cubic fields, a cubic integer polynomial &quot;P&quot; irreducible over Q will have at least one real root. If it has one real and two complex roots the corresponding cubic extension of Q defined by adjoining the real root will &quot;not&quot; be totally real, although it is a field of real numbers.

The totally real number fields play a significant special role in algebraic number theory. An abelian extension of Q is either totally real, or contains a totally real subfield over which it has degree two.

Any number field that is Galois over the rationals must be either totally real or totally imaginary.

<text>The cut and restore rope trick is a magic effect in which the performer cuts a piece of rope (usually tied into a knot) which then appears to be magically restored. Sometimes the trick is done with a piece of string, a handkerchief, or a turban instead of an actual rope.

== Method ==
There are many variations on the cut and restore rope trick, but most or all are variations on three basic methods.

The first method involves using sleight of hand to make the viewers believe that the rope is being cut at the middle, but really it is being cut close to the end. The result is a piece of rope nearly as long as the original and the viewers won&#x27;t notice the slight change in length.

The second method involves introducing a short piece of rope of the same type as the main rope, and cutting that instead. This can be accomplished by many sleight of hand tricks but attaching it to the main rope disguised as the loop of a knot is the most common method. When the performer removes the knot, the original rope is completely uncut.

The third method involves gimmicked ropes that can literally be rejoined with the use of adhesives or some other method. Usually, the gimmicked ends of the rope are the original two ends, so each segment is 180 degrees from where it started, with the freshly cut portions on the end.

<text>Antonie &quot;Anton&quot; Pannekoek (; 2 January 1873 – 28 April 1960) was a Dutch astronomer, historian,
philosopher, Marxist theorist, and socialist revolutionary. He was one of the main theorists of council communism ().

== Early life ==
Anton was born 2 January 1873 in Vaassen. His father managed a small metal foundry and his mother was a midwife. He had two sisters and a brother. His elder brother, Adolf, attended the Hogere Burgerschool, Apeldoorn. At the age of 12 Anton borrowed a textbooks from his brother and studied the constellation Gemini, where he noticed an extra point of light. Upon reflection he realised this was the planet Saturn. He soon followed his brother in attending the same school, where he showed a strong scientific aptitude, particularly in biology and astronomy.

== Biography ==

Pannekoek studied mathematics and physics in Leiden from 1891. Even before he went to college he was interested in astronomy and studied the Milky Way and variability of Polaris. He published his first article, &quot;On the Necessity of Further Researches on the Milky Way&quot;, as a student. He briefly worked as a geodesist before he returned to the Leiden Observatory () to work as an observer and write his thesis on the variability of Algol.

After reading Edward Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;Equality&quot;, Pannekoek became a convinced socialist and started studying the philosophies of Karl Marx and Joseph Dietzgen. Soon Pannekoek became a well-known Marxist writer, writing for both Dutch and German socialist magazines, like &quot;Die Neue Zeit&quot;. His astronomical and socialist careers first clashed when he was reprimanded for leading a strike support committee and was treated with dismissal from his job at the observatory by the Dutch government. Around the same time, he was growing dissatisfied with the stale atmosphere and outdated methodologies at the Leiden Observatory. Pannekoek was offered the option to become a lecturer in historical materialism at the school funded by the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He soon ran into trouble with the German authorities, who threatened him with expulsion if he continued teaching. He remained in Berlin, however, where he kept writing for journals and newspapers. In 1910, he moved to Bremen where he soon became one of the prominent proponents of the radical Bremen Left.

Pannekoek was on holiday in the Netherlands when the First World War broke out. Prevented from returning to Germany, he started work as a cosmography and science teacher for secondary schools and a &quot;privaatdocent&quot; in history of astronomy at Leiden University. Though Willem de Sitter wanted to hire him as assistant director at the Leiden Observatory in 1918, the appointment was prevented by the Dutch government because of his outspoken Marxist sympathies. Instead, the Amsterdam city council appointed him at the University of Amsterdam in 1918 as a lecturer. In 1921, he founded the astronomical institute there; in 1925, he was appointed as extraordinary professor; and in 1932 as full professor.

== Astronomy ==
Pannekoek began systematically observing the night sky and recording these observations while he was still in secondary school. Some of his observations of variable stars later found their way into his scientific publications. In the winter of 1889–1890, he recorded the variability of Polaris, which had been suspected before but was not confirmed until 1908 by Ejnar Hertzsprung. He also tracked the variability of Algol, which formed the foundation for his PhD thesis.

Another early interest of Pannekoek was the appearance of the Milky Way. In 1898, Pannekoek published a series of articles in which he articulated how he thought the Milky Way should be observed. Here, he explained that minor details should be tracked through verbal descriptions, while the general distribution of light should be tracked to isophotic lines. Pannekoek published his own observations of the northern Milky Way in 1920 in the form of drawings, isophotic diagrams, and verbal descriptions. He also combined his observations the independent observations of Cornelis Easton, Otto Boeddicker, and Julius Schmidt to create a composite image of the Milky Way, which he called the &quot;mean subjective image&quot;. A few years later, he also published his observations of the southern Milky Way, which he made during an eclipse expedition to the Dutch Indies in 1926. He also developed a photographic method to represent the light distribution of the Milky Way. To capture the clouds that formed the Milky Way, Pannekoek deliberately recorded photographic plates out of focus, which caused the light of stars to spread into disks, allowing their light to overlap. These plates were then measured and combined into tables showing the surface brightness of the Milky Way.

Pannekoek&#x27;s research on the appearance of the Milky Way was closely connected to his research on the structure of the galaxy. In this research, he adapted the statistical methods of Jacobus Kapteyn to investigate individual clusters in the galaxy. His most important results were the measurement of the distance to the star clusters responsible for the Milky Way clouds in Cygnus and Aquila. He determined that these were located at a distance of 40000-60000 parsec from the sun. This was much more distant than was commonly assumed to be the diameter of the entire galactic system. This result provided early evidence for Harlow Shapley&#x27;s expanded galaxy.

The final decades of his professional career Pannekoek mostly spent on researching the astrophysics of stellar atmospheres. In his theoretical research, Pannekoek explored ways to expand upon Meghnad Saha&#x27;s ionization formula to better understand the physical conditions in the outer layer of stars. One of his main conclusions was that the narrow spectral lines in c-type stars, as found by Antonia Maury, were most likely caused by lower pressure in the stellar atmospheres. In the 1930s, he developed theoretical models for the atmospheres in order to reproduce the entire spectrum of a star, but failed to produce a model that was entirely satisfactory. In 1935, Rupert Wildt showed that this was because Pannekoek had underestimated the impact of the H− ion as a source of optical opacity.

In observational astrophysics, Pannekoek produced the curve of growth for Deneb in 1931, the first for a star other than the sun. He and his students also published comprehensive catalogues of the spectral lines in late type stars based on photographic plates taken by Pannekoek at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in 1929. Because of these studies, he is considered to be the founder of astrophysics as a separate discipline in the Netherlands.

Pannekoek was also part of scientific expeditions to observe solar eclipses in Sumatra and Lapland. He was also interested in the history of astronomy and his book, &quot;A History of Astronomy&quot;, is considered a standard reference on the subject.

Pannekoek became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1925. His work in galactic structure, astrophysics and the history of astronomy was of international renown and won him an honorary degree from Harvard University in 1936, as well as the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1951. The crater Pannekoek on the Moon and the asteroid 2378 Pannekoek are named after him. The Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy at the University of Amsterdam, which he founded, was named after him in 1982.

== Thought ==
=== Council communism ===
A recognized Marxist theorist, Pannekoek was one of the founders of council communism and a main figure in the radical left in the Netherlands and Germany. He was active in the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (Netherlands), Social Democratic Party of Germany, Communist Party of the Netherlands, the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of the Netherlands and the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany.

Pannekoek was best known for his writing on workers&#x27; councils. He regarded these as a new form of organisation capable of overcoming the limitations of the old institutions of the labour movement, the trade unions and social democratic parties. Basing his theory on what he regarded as the practical lessons of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Pannekoek argued that the workers&#x27; revolution and the transition from capitalism to communism had to be achieved by the workers themselves, democratically organised in workers&#x27; councils.

Pannekoek was a sharp critic of anarchism, social democracy, and Vladimir Lenin and Leninism. During the early years of the Russian revolution, Pannekoek gave critical support to the Bolsheviks, a position shared by fellow council communist Herman Gorter. He expressed misgivings about the authoritarian tendencies of Leninism, fearing for the socialist character of the Russian Revolution unless it should find a rectifying support in a proletarian revolution in the West. His later analysis of the failure of the Russian revolution was that after Lenin and the Bolsheviks came to power, they crippled the soviets. Instead of workers&#x27; councils, the Bolsheviks had instituted the rule of their party, which in Pannekoek&#x27;s view is what led to the institution of the Bolsheviks as a new ruling class. He put his views forward in his 1938 book &quot;Lenin als Philosoph&quot;, originally published in German under the pseudonym J. Harper. It was translated into English in 1948 as &quot;Lenin as philosopher - a critical examination of the philosophical basis of Leninism&quot;.

===Marxism and Darwinism===

In a pamphlet Pannekoek strongly attacked and rebutted the arguments of Social Darwinists such as Herbert Spencer, whom Pannekoek dubbed &quot;Bourgeois Darwinists&quot;.

On the basis of Darwin&#x27;s own writings—in particular on &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex &quot; (1871)—Pannekoek stated:

<text>Basse-Terre (, ; ; , ) is a commune in the French overseas department of Guadeloupe, in the Lesser Antilles. It is also the &quot;prefecture&quot; (capital city) of Guadeloupe. The city of Basse-Terre is located on Basse-Terre Island, the western half of Guadeloupe.

Although it is the administrative capital, Basse-Terre is only the second-largest city in Guadeloupe, behind Pointe-à-Pitre. Together with its urban area, it had 44,864 inhabitants in 2012 (11,534 of whom lived in the city of Basse-Terre proper).

==Geography==
Basse-Terre is located in the south-western corner of the Basse-Terre portion of the island of Guadeloupe which is itself located some 100 km north of Dominica and some 450 km south-east of Puerto Rico. The commune is at the foot of the Soufrière volcano and is connected to the rest of the island by three main roads:

*The which exits the commune in the south on the coast and continues inland to Gourbeyre then all the way around the coast to Pointe-à-Pitre on Grande-Terre.
*The which goes north along the coast to Vieux Habitants and continues all the way around the coast to join the N1 at Baie Mahault.
*The N3 which traverses the length of the commune and continues to Saint-Claude inland.

Basse-Terre has a maritime station that receives cruise ships and has a ferry service to the Îles des Saintes.

The commune is mostly urban with some farmland in the north-east and north-west.

The different districts of Basse-Terre are: Agincourt (also Saint-Claude), Bas-du-Bourg, Carmel, Desmarais (also Saint-Claude) Guillaud, Morne-Chaulet, Morne-à-Vaches (also Saint-Claude), Petit-Paris, Pintade, Rivière-des-Peres, La Rue-Maillan, Saint-François, Sur-le Morne, and Versailles.

==Climate==
Basse-Terre lies at a transitional point between a tropical rainforest climate and a tropical monsoon climate. As is the norm with cities with these two climate types, Basse-Terre features relatively consistent temperatures throughout the year.

==Toponymy==
==History==
===Native American origins===
Before Basse-Terre became a French town it was a village of American Indian horticulturists and potters. The village was on the site of the present Basse-Terre Cathedral where archaeological excavations found human remains and other evidence of occupation during the restoration of the cathedral.

In 2005 on the lower part of a Native American garbage dump, excavations have uncovered a new dump containing large amounts of archaeological material: food waste, ceramics, stone tools and shell tools, ornaments, charcoal and a tomb.

===Birth of the town of Basse-Terre (1635–1649)===
In 1635, when it was part of Saint Kitts and Nevis, an expedition was seeking a place of lasting presence in Guadeloupe. The operation was entrusted to Charles Liénard de l&#x27;Olive and Jean du Plessis d&#x27;Ossonville together with 4 missionaries and 550 colonists. The landing took place on 28 June 1635, at Pointe Allègre, far from Basse-Terre. Famine pushed the party to the south near the present town of Vieux-Fort in early 1636. The relationship between Native Americans and colonists degraded quickly; Liénard then began a bloody war against the locals. In 1660 a treaty forced him to retreat to Dominica and Saint Vincent. The war forced him to build a fort, today &quot;Fort Olive&quot; at Vieux Fort. In 1640 Jean Aubert succeeded Liénard as the government of the island and he soon left the site to settle on the left bank of the &quot;&quot;, which is the current Gourbeyre marina. In 1643 Charles Houël du Petit Pré replaced Aubert and, in 1649, he left the marina site for the right bank of the Galion and built a fort. Some religious built the first church, now the , shortly afterwards and the city was organized around the chapel and from the fort to the river of Herbs. This was the beginning of Basse-Terre.

===Birth of the town of Saint-François (circa 1680)===
Around 1680 on the right bank of the (&quot;River of Herbs&quot;) the Capuchins built a chapel dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi where the present Guadeloupe Cathedral is located and a second centre of population grew around this place of worship. The River of Herbs separated the two distinct villages: Basse-Terre and Saint Francis. In reality, people flocked to the new town because of raids by English privateers who burned the town of Basse-Terre in 1691 and again in 1703. Following these raids the people thought that the fort was attracting foreign privateers and consequently moved to Saint Francis. A stone bridge was built in 1739 replacing a ford and a wooden bridge across the river of Herbs.

===British occupation (1759–1763) and tentative revival (1763–1789)===
On 23 January 1759, a British expeditionary force captured the island. Guadeloupe was occupied by the British until 10 February 1763, when it was returned to France in the Treaty of Paris. Basse-Terre experienced a resurgence of activity despite the founding of Pointe-à-Pitre in 1764 – a town in a better position to receive the ocean swell – and despite a fire in September 1782. The town was partially redesigned around 1787.

===Revolutionary period (1789–1802)===
The French Revolution reached the island and therefore Basse-Terre in September 1789. In 1793, counter-revolutionary planters agreed to cede the island to the British. They captured Guadeloupe, then governed by Victor Collot, on 22 April 1794 and appointed Thomas Dundas as the new governor. As early as May 1794, Victor Hugues, sent by the National Convention in Paris, managed to recapture the colony and abolish slavery. The French dislodged the cannon in December 1794 and installed a guillotine. The city was the scene of military operations conducted by General Richepanse, who was sent by Napoleon to reestablish slavery, against Louis Delgrès in 1802. Delgrès retreated to the fort on 20 May 1802 and abandoned it on 22 May.

===Difficult renewal (1802–1870)===
The town was occupied from 6 February 1810 to 30 May 1814 and again from 10 August 1815 to July 1816. For over 20 years Basse-Terre suffered from the effects of these disturbances. Only after four hurricanes (in 1816, 1821, 1825, and 1844) did Basse-Terre think of rehabilitating the construction and development of the Champ d&#x27;Arbaud by building a Military Hospital (now Gerville-Réache High School), a bishopric, sanitation, and expansion of the city by creating new neighbourhoods such as Trianon, Versailles, Petite Guinée, and Petit-Paris but the situation remained unchanged, worsened more by a cholera epidemic in 1865.

===Renewed activity (1870–1976)===
From 1870 the commune began to recover and inaugurated its town hall in 1899. It was the first city in Guadeloupe to be electrified in 1913. The impetus came from Ali Tur, who arrived after the cyclone of September 1928 and built the courthouse, the General Council, and a market in the 1930s. A port was built (as wooden quays had previously served as a port) from 1961 to 1964, the boulevard was built in 1962 to serve the port: it was extended in 1964 and again in 1965 along what was once a pebble and black sand beach that ran along the coast. On 26 November 1970, 1.5 inches of rain (38.1 mm) fell in a minute, the heaviest ever recorded. Cyclonic conditions repeatedly ravaged the development of this boulevard in 1989 with Hurricane Hugo and Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, Hurricane Lenny in 1999, and Hurricane Omar in 2008.

===Since 1976===
In 1976 73,600 inhabitants of Guadeloupe were evacuated (from 15 August to 18 November 1976) due to the high activity of the Soufrière volcano. Some evacuees never returned and moved to Jarry. For 20 years, the town centre was depopulated in favour of peri-urban areas or neighbouring towns such Baillif, Saint-Claude, and Gourbeyre despite attempts at renewal.

The Bar Association of the Bar of Guadeloupe is also established in the commune. Basse-Terre benefits from the presence of a Chamber of bailiffs, a Chamber of Notaries, and a Chamber of Commerce. The prefecture is also present and the city is the seat of the &quot;Urban community of South Basse-Terre&quot;. There is a police station and a prison.

===Twinning===

Basse-Terre has twinning associations with:
* Pondicherry (India) since 1981

In 2012 the hospital in Basse-Terre had 235 beds organized into four areas (emergency, surgery, enlarged internal medicine, obstetrics and pediatrics) and had a staff of 850 doctors, hospital and administrative staff. The commune also has a Health Centre.

==Town planning==
===Urban morphology===
Over the centuries the commune spread along a street formerly named Grand Rue. The River of Herbs separates two early nuclei of houses which now correspond to the districts of Carmel and Saint Francis. The town developed on a narrow coastal strip between the Caribbean Sea and the first hills of the long mountain ridge that divides the island in two. The volcanic massif of the Soufrière is to the north-east and the mountains of &quot;Caraïbes&quot; and &quot;Houëlmont&quot; are to the south-east, which enclose the commune in lush greenery. The city itself stretches over 3 km in spite of a rugged terrain intersected by ravines.

===Communal territory===
The boundaries of the commune have varied over the centuries. The colonial Decree of 20 September 1837 endorsed the creation of communes (endorsed on 12 November 1789) and set the powers of the mayor and city council. The territory of Basse-Terre was previously split into two: &quot;intra-muros&quot; which was the urban part and its inner periphery and &quot;extra-muros&quot; that extended to the slopes of the Soufrière (although this terminology is used, the city has never been surrounded by walls). In 1837 two new communes were created by cutting &quot;extra-muros&quot; from Basse-Terre and the future Saint-Claude and Gourbeyre were created. A decision of the municipal council of 15 March 1839 specified the limits of the commune. By 16 October 1953, the commune has grown and included the neighbourhoods of Rivière-des-Peres by the sea as well as Pintade, Thillac, Morne-à-Vaches, Desmarais, Guillard, and Delille.

===Housing===
The total number of dwellings in the commune is 6,143 (2017). 77.0% are primary residences. The number of second homes is 80.8% and the number of vacancies is 22.2% which is above the national average of 8%.

==Economy==

There has been development of the economic sector through improving the reception of cruise ships and passengers in the port of Basse-Terre. The first stone for the ferry terminal was laid on 27 December 2013. The modern terminal has a capacity of 100 people with areas for ticketing and restaurants was opened on 2 October 2015.

===Employment===
The unemployment rate in 2017 for the town was 40.7% out of a total workforce of 4,286 individuals.


==Culture and heritage==
The commune has a very large number of buildings and sites that are registered as historical monuments. Some of the most interesting are shown below.

===Civil heritage===

*Fort Delgrès (formerly Fort Saint-Charles), built by Charles Houël in 1649; thereafter many governors expanded it and made substantial changes. It was taken and retaken several times.

<text>Gravesend is a town in northwest Kent, England, situated 21 miles (35 km) east-southeast of Charing Cross (central London) on the south bank of the River Thames, opposite Tilbury in Essex. Located in the diocese of Rochester, it is the administrative centre of the borough of Gravesham. Gravesend marks the eastern limit of the Greater London Built-up Area, as defined by the UK Office for National Statistics. It had a population of 58,102 in 2021.

Its geographical situation has given Gravesend strategic importance throughout the maritime and communications history of South East England. A Thames Gateway commuter town, it retains strong links with the River Thames, not least through the Port of London Authority Pilot Station, and has witnessed rejuvenation since the advent of High Speed 1 rail services via Gravesend railway station. The station was recently refurbished and has a new bridge.

==Name==

Recorded as Gravesham in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it belonged to Odo, Earl of Kent and Bishop of Bayeux, the half-brother of William the Conqueror, its name probably derives from &quot;graaf-ham&quot;: the home of the reeve or bailiff of the lord of the manor.

Another theory suggests that the name &quot;Gravesham&quot; may be a corruption of the words &quot;grafs-ham&quot; – a place &quot;at the end of the grove&quot;. Frank Carr asserts that the name derives from the Saxon &quot;Gerevesend&quot;, the end of the authority of the Portreeve (originally &quot;Portgereve&quot;, chief town administrator).

In the Netherlands, a place called &#x27;s-Gravenzande is found with its name translating into &quot;Sand (or sandy area) belonging to the Count&quot;. The &quot;″s&quot; is a contraction of the old Dutch genitive article &quot;des&quot;, and translates into plain English as &quot;of the&quot;. In Brooklyn, New York, the neighbourhood of Gravesend is said by some to have been named for &#x27;s-Gravenzande, though its founding by the English religious dissenter Lady Deborah Moody in 1645 suggests that it may be named after Gravesend, England. Lady Deborah was originally from London and is credited with being the first woman to found a settlement in the New World.

The Domesday spelling is its earliest known historical record; all other spellings – in the later (c. 1100) Domesday &quot;Monachorum&quot; and in &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; the town is &quot;Gravesend&quot; and &quot;Gravesende&quot;, respectively. The variation &quot;Graveshend&quot; can be seen in a court record of 1422, where Edmund de Langeford was parson, and attributed to where the graves ended after the Black Death. The municipal title Gravesham was formally adopted in 1974 as the name for the new borough.

==History==
Stone Age implements have been found in the locality since the 1900s, as has evidence of an Iron Age settlement at nearby Springhead. Extensive Roman remains have been found at nearby Vagniacae, and Gravesend lies immediately to the north of the Roman road connecting London with the Kent coast – now called Watling Street. Domesday Book recorded mills, , and fisheries here.

Milton Chantry is Gravesend&#x27;s oldest surviving building and dates from the early 14th century. It was refounded as a chapel in 1320/21 on the original site of a former leper hospital founded in 1189. It is a Grade II* listed building.

Gravesend has one of the oldest surviving markets in the country. Its earliest charter dates from 1268, with town status being granted to the two parishes of Gravesend and Milton by King Henry III in its Charter of Incorporation of that year. The first mayor of Gravesend was elected in 1268 but the first town hall was not built until 1573. The current Gravesend Town Hall was completed in 1764: although it ceased to operate as a seat of government in 1968 when the new Gravesham Civic Centre was opened, it remained in use as a magistrates&#x27; court until 2000. It now operates as a venue for weddings and civil partnership ceremonies.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Gravesend was raided by a Castilian fleet in 1380.

In 1401, a further royal charter was granted, allowing the men of the town to operate boats between London and the town; these became known as the &quot;Long Ferry&quot;. It became the preferred form of passage, because of the perils of road travel (see below).

On Gravesend&#x27;s river front are the remains of a device fort built by command of King Henry VIII in 1543.

In March 1617, John Rolfe and his Native American wife Rebecca (Pocahontas), with their two-year-old son, Thomas, boarded a ship in London bound for the Commonwealth of Virginia; the ship had only sailed as far as Gravesend before Rebecca fell ill, and she died shortly after she was taken ashore. It is not known what caused her death. Her funeral and interment took place on 21 March 1617 at the parish church of St George, Gravesend. The site of her grave was underneath the church&#x27;s chancel, though since the previous church was destroyed by fire in 1727 her exact resting place is unknown. Thomas Rolfe survived, but was placed under the supervision of Sir Lewis Stukley at Plymouth, before being sent to his uncle, Henry Rolfe whilst John Rolfe and his late wife&#x27;s assistant Tomocomo reached America under the captaincy of Sir Samuel Argall&#x27;s ship. Pocahontas (real name: Matoaka) is an important figure in both American and British history and was the inspiration for the popular Disney animated film of the same name.
At Fort Gardens is the New Tavern Fort, built during the 1780s and extensively rebuilt by Major-General Charles Gordon between 1865 and 1879; it is now the Chantry Heritage Centre, under the care of Gravesend Local History Society. The fort is a scheduled monument.

Journeys by road to Gravesend were historically quite hazardous, since the main London-Dover road crossed Blackheath, notorious for its highwaymen. Stagecoaches from London to Canterbury, Dover and Faversham used Gravesend as one of their &quot;stages&quot; as did those coming north from Tonbridge. In 1840 there were 17 coaches picking up and setting down passengers and changing horses each way per day. There were two coaching inns on what is now Old Road East: &quot;the Prince of Orange&quot; and &quot;the Lord Nelson&quot;. Post coaches had been plying the route for at least two centuries: Samuel Pepys records having stopped off at Gravesend in 1650 en route to the Royal Dockyards at Chatham.

A permanent military presence was established in the town when Milton Barracks opened in 1862.

Although much of the town&#x27;s economy continued to be connected with maritime trade, since the 19th century other major employers have been the cement and paper industries.
From 1932 to 1956, an airport was located to the east of the town. On Sunday 5 February 1939, Alex Henshaw commenced his record-breaking flight to Cape Town and back from here. He completed the flight in 39 hours 36 minutes over the next four days; his record still stands. Originally a civilian airfield, during World War II it became a fighter station, RAF Gravesend, and so Gravesend was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. In 1956 the site was taken over by Gravesend Borough Council; a large housing estate, known as Riverview Park, was built on its site.

==Governance==
Gravesend is the principal town of the Borough of Gravesham. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of the Municipal Borough of Gravesend and Northfleet Urban District along with several parishes from Strood Rural District. Gravesend was incorporated as a Municipal Borough in 1835 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and Northfleet was constituted an Urban District in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894: Gravesend absorbed Milton (1914), Denton, Chalk and part of Northfleet, including Claphall, Singlewell and King&#x27;s Farm (1935).

==Geography==
Gravesend is located at a point where the higher land – the lowest point of the dip slope of the North Downs – reaches the Thames. To the east are the low-lying Shorne Marshes; to the west, beyond Northfleet and the Swanscombe Marshes. The settlement was thus established as it was a good landing place: it was also sheltered by the prominent height of what is now called Windmill Hill (&quot;see Landmarks below&quot;); although Windmill Hill still remains a dominant feature, Gravesend&#x27;s highest point is actually further inland at Marling Cross, adjacent to the A2.

From its origins as a landing place and shipping port, Gravesend gradually extended southwards and eastwards. Better-off people from London visited the town during the summer months; at first by boat, and then by railway. More extensive building began after World War I; this increased after World War II, when many of the housing estates in the locality were built.

Gravesend&#x27;s built-up areas comprise &quot;Painters Ash&quot;, adjacent to the A2; &quot;King&#x27;s Farm&quot; (most of King&#x27;s Farm estate was built in the 1920s); and &quot;Christianfields&quot;. The latter housing estate was completely rebuilt in a 6-year project from 2007 to 2013. There is also the aforementioned Riverview Park estate built on the old RAF field in the south-east, in the 1960s, and Singlewell, which is adjacent to the A2 in the South

Part of the southern built-up area of the town was originally two separate rural parishes: &quot;viz&quot;, Cobham and Northfleet.

==Climate==
Gravesend has an oceanic climate similar to much of southern England, being accorded Köppen Climate Classification-subtype of &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate).

On 10 August 2003, Gravesend recorded one of the highest temperatures since records began in the United Kingdom, with a reading of , only beaten by Brogdale, near Faversham, to the ESE. Gravesend, which has a Met Office site, reports its data each hour.

Being inland and yet relatively close to continental Europe, Gravesend enjoys a somewhat more continental climate than the coastal areas of Kent, Essex and East Anglia and also compared to western parts of Britain. It is therefore less cloudy, drier, and less prone to Atlantic depressions with their associated wind and rain than western parts, as well as being hotter in summer and colder in winter.

Thus Gravesend continues to record higher temperatures in summer, sometimes being the hottest place in the country, &quot;e.g.&quot; on the warmest day of 2011, when temperatures reached 33.1 °C. Additionally, the town holds at least two records for the year 2010, of 30.9 °C and 31.7 °C. Another record was set during England&#x27;s Indian summer of 2011 with 29.9 °C., the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK for October. In 2016 the warmest day of the year occurred very late on 13 September with a very high temperature of 34.4C

==Demography==
Since 1990 the economy of Gravesham has changed from one based on heavy industry to being service-based. The borough&#x27;s estimated population in 2012 was 101,700: a 6,000 increase in less than a decade. It has a high population density (almost 10 people per hectare) compared to nationally; it has a relatively young population (40% of the population are below 30); and 60% of the population are of working age.

Based upon figures from the 2021 census, the second largest religious group in the borough are Sikhs who at that time made up 8% of the population. However, if the term belief is used, Christians are most numerous at more than (49%), non-religious (32.1%) and third Sikhs (8%).

==Shopping==

Gravesend today is a commercial and commuter town, providing a local shopping district, including the St Georges shopping complex, the Thamesgate shopping centre and a regular farmers&#x27; market. It also used to have a Debenhams and Wilko, but they closed down. Gravesend market hall, in the heart of the town, was first chartered in 1268.

==Landmarks==

===Gravesend Town Pier===

Gravesend has the world&#x27;s oldest surviving cast iron pier, built in 1834.
It is a unique structure having the first known iron cylinders used in its construction. The pier was completely refurbished in 2004 and now features a bar and restaurant; with public access to the pier head when the premises are open.
A recent £2 million investment in a pontoon is now in place at the pier head onto the Thames, which provides for small and medium-sized craft to land at Gravesend. On 17 September 2012, the Gravesend–Tilbury Ferry, relocated to the Town Pier, from its previous terminal in nearby West Street.

===Royal Terrace Pier===

Built in 1844, the initial construction was funded by the Gravesend Freehold Investment Company, at a cost of £9,200. It was where Princess Alexandra of Denmark arrived on her way to marry Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in March 1865, and River pilots have been based here since the late 19th century.

Today, Royal Terrace Pier is in constant 24-hour use, as part of the Port of London Authority main operations centre and Gravesend RNLI Lifeboat Station, one of four lifeboat stations situated on the River Thames; thus, its public access is available only occasionally during the year. It is T-shaped, with a pontoon at its pier head. Like the Town Pier, Royal Terrace Pier is also a Grade II listed structure.

===Gravesend Clock Tower, Milton Road===

Situated at the junction of Milton Road and Harmer Street, its foundation stone was laid on 6 September 1887. The memorial stone records that the clock tower was erected by public subscription (£700 was raised toward its construction) and dedicated to Queen Victoria, to commemorate the 50th year of her reign. Built of Portland and Dumfries stone and backed by London stock brick, the design of the structure is based on the design of the Elizabeth Tower in the Palace of Westminster, which houses Big Ben. The centre of the clock itself is measured at 50 feet (15 m) above ground and the face measures 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) in diameter. The tower is Grade II listed.

===Pocahontas statue===

An American sculptor, William Ordway Partridge, created a life-size statue of the 17th-century Native American princess Pocahontas, which was unveiled at Jamestown, Virginia in 1922. Queen Elizabeth II viewed this statue in 1957 and again on 4 May 2007, while visiting Jamestown on the 400th anniversary of foundation, it being the first successful English colonial settlement in America.

On 5 October 1958, an exact replica of Partridge&#x27;s statue was dedicated as a memorial to Pocahontas at St George&#x27;s Parish Church. The Governor of Virginia presented the statue as a gift to the British people in 1958, a gesture prompted by The Queen&#x27;s visit to the USA in the previous year.

In 2017, US Ambassador Matthew Barzun visited the statue to mark the 400th anniversary of the death and burial of Pocahontas in Gravesend. The Ambassador laid a floral tribute of 21 roses at its base, symbolising each year of Pocahontas&#x27; life.

===Windmill Hill===

Windmill Hill, named after its former windmills, offers extensive views across the Thames and was a popular spot for Victorian visitors to the town because of the camera obscura installed at the &quot;Old Mill&quot; and for its tea gardens and other amusements.

The hill was the site of a beacon in 1377, which was instituted by King Richard II, and still in use 200 years later at the time of the Spanish Armada, although the hill was then known as &quot;Rouge Hill&quot;. A modern beacon was erected and lit in 1988, the 400th anniversary of the Armada.

It was during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I that the first windmill was placed at the highest point in Gravesend, overlooking the high-water mark of the river. One mill burnt down in 1763 but was replaced the following year and that too demolished in 1894. The last surviving windmill is reported as having been destroyed by fire during Mafeking Night celebrations in 1900.

During World War I an Imperial German Navy airship passed over Windmill Hill, dropping bombs on it; today there are three markers indicating where these bombs struck.

=== Gravesend Power Station ===
Gravesend power station (TQ 6575 7413) was built by the Gravesend Corporation in 1902–03 to supply local demand for electricity. It was built on the south side of the basin at the west end of the Thames and Medway canal. The buildings were demolished in 1995.

== Gravesend and the River Thames ==

The Thames has long been an important feature in Gravesend life, and may well have been the deciding factor for the first settlement there. One of the town&#x27;s first distinctions was in being given the sole right to transport passengers to and from London by water in the late 14th century. The &quot;Tilt Boat&quot; was a familiar sight as it sailed along the Thames, the passengers protected from the weather by a canvas tilt (awning). The first steamboat plied its trade between Gravesend and London in the early 19th century, bringing with it a steadily increasing number of visitors to the Terrace Pier Gardens, Windmill Hill, Springhead Gardens and Rosherville Gardens. Gravesend soon became one of the first English resort towns and thrived from an early tourist trade.

Gravesend &quot;watermen&quot; were often in a family trade; and the town is the headquarters of the Port of London Authority Control Centre (formerly known as &quot;Thames Navigation Service&quot;), has its headquarters at Gravesend, providing maritime pilots who play an important role in navigation on the River Thames.

A dinghy at an unmodernised Gravesend was the backdrop to the 1952 thriller &quot;The Long Memory&quot; starring Sir John Mills. In the film, Mills plays a character living in poverty on a derelict fishing boat stranded in the mud flats.

Gravesend has one of England&#x27;s oldest regattas retained from its strong maritime links with the Thames. Although the origins of the regatta are unknown it dates back at least to Tudor times. The races are traditionally competed by Gravesend skiffs, oaken round-bottomed, clinker-built boats.

The &quot;Thames Navigation Service&quot; was first thought up between 1950 and 1952 by Cdr Peter de Neumann, while he was captain of HMRC cutter &quot;Vigilant&quot; based at Gravesend Reach. This idea followed from considering such incidents as the accidental ramming of HMS &quot;Truculent&quot; by the &quot;Divina&quot; in 1950, the collision with the &quot;Nore Forts&quot; by &quot;Baalbek&quot;, and the disastrous flooding of Canvey, Foulness and the East Coast in 1953. In these and other situations, rescue and intelligence gathering were severely hampered by a lack of centralised command and control, and lack of a detailed &quot;picture&quot;. De Neumann resigned his command after returning &quot;Vigilant&quot; from the Spithead Review and joined the PLA, immediately suggesting, in a report to them submitted in 1953, that a feasibility study of such a system be carried out. He then oversaw its development and ultimate installation at Gravesend.
Until the building of Tilbury Docks, on the opposite side of the river, between 1882 and 1886, Gravesend was the Thames&#x27;s first port of entry. Thousands of emigrants, as well as large numbers of troops, embarked from here. Tilbury Docks have expanded considerably since, with the closure of all the London Docks. The entrance to the Docks is somewhat awkward, situated as it is on the sharp bend of the river, and boats often need tugboat assistance, as do the larger ships moored at Tilbury landing stages. There have been many tug companies based at Gravesend: among them the Sun Company, the Alexandra Towing Company and, today, the Smith Howard Towing Company. East Indiamen traditionally stopped here at a point known as Long Reach to lighten their loads before sailing up the Thames to moorings at Blackwall.

For some years after, war steamer excursions were run on the MV &quot;Royal Daffodil&quot; down the Thames from Gravesend to France, but they ceased in 1966. Cruises are now operated by the Lower Thames and Medway Passenger Boat Company up the river to Greenwich. The cross-river passenger ferry to Tilbury provides a long-established route to and from Essex. Before the Dartford Crossing came into being, there was a vehicle ferry at Gravesend as well.

There is a RNLI lifeboat station, based at Royal Terrace Pier, which is one of the busiest in the country.

===Thames and Medway Canal===
The Thames and Medway Canal was opened for barge traffic in 1824. It ran from Gravesend on the Thames to Frindsbury near Strood on the Medway. Although seven miles long, it had only two locks, each by in size, one at each end. Its most notable feature was the tunnel near Strood, which was long, the second longest canal tunnel ever built in the UK. The great cost of the tunnel meant that the canal was not a commercial success.

After only 20 years, most of the canal was closed and the canal&#x27;s tunnel was converted to railway use. Initially, canal and railway shared the tunnel, with the single track built on timber supports, but by 1847, canal use was abandoned and a double track laid. Today Gravesend Canal Basin is used for the mooring of pleasure craft. Gravesend Sailing Club, which was founded so that working men could participate in the sport while still having to earn a living is based here. The lock has been dredged, and restoration and strengthening work has been carried out on the basin walls as part of the regeneration of the area.

==Transport==

===Roads===
The main roads through the town are the west–east A226 road from Dartford and beyond to Rochester; and the A227 road to Tonbridge. The A2 road passes two miles (3 km) south of Gravesend town centre; a mile stretch of it was rerouted in the early 2000s to take the traffic away from the south end of the town.

On 26 March 2006 the first of the area&#x27;s new Fastrack bus services, which use a combination of ordinary roads and dedicated &#x27;bus tracks&#x27;, opened. The service links to Ebbsfleet International railway station, Greenhithe, Bluewater Shopping Centre and Dartford.

===Rail===

Gravesend railway station lies on the North Kent Line, and was opened in 1849. The Gravesend West Line, terminating by the river and for some time operating as a continental ferry connection, closed in 1968.

Gravesend is the primary north Kent interchange for high speed and metro rail services. In December 2009, the full high-speed timetable between London and Kent came into force and passenger usage from Gravesend has exceeded expectations. High-speed services from London St Pancras and Stratford International, are offered via Gravesend to the Medway towns, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate. Some of these services continue to Ashford International via Sandwich and Dover Priory.

There are also metro services to London Charing Cross, London Waterloo East and London Bridge via Sidcup, via Woolwich Arsenal and Lewisham and Bexleyheath, and to Gillingham.

Unusually Gravesend features a Platform 0, one of the few in the country, it is used for terminating services from London Cannon Street or London Charing Cross via Sidcup.

===Buses===
Gravesend is served by several Arriva Kent Thameside bus services connecting the town with other areas in Kent including Dartford, Bluewater and Sevenoaks and to the Medway Towns.
Gravesend is also served by Fastrack bus services connecting the town with Bluewater, Darent Valley Hospital and Dartford.

===Ferry===
Passenger ferry services to Tilbury, Essex, operated daily (except Sundays), from Gravesend Town Pier until 31 March 2024.

===Footpaths===

The Saxon Shore Way, a long distance footpath, starts at Gravesend and traces the coast as in Roman times as far as Hastings, East Sussex; 163 miles (262 km) in total. The Wealdway also starts at the Town Pier, and continues almost due south over the Weald to Eastbourne in East Sussex where it links with South Downs Way, a distance of 80 miles (128 km).

==Religious buildings==
The town&#x27;s principal Anglican place of worship is the Church of St George, Gravesend. This Georgian building is a tourist attraction because of its association with Princess Pocahontas, as well as being the parish church. Gravesend has three other Church of England parishes and Roman Catholic, Methodist, United Reformed and Baptist churches as well as other smaller chapels.
Gravesend has a significant Sikh population of more than 15,000, representing over 15% of the town&#x27;s population. Its first gurdwara was founded in 1956 by Bhat Sikh Santokh Singh Takk in Edwin Street with a second one opening, ten years later, in a former Congregationalist church, but this gurdwara closed in 2010. The same year, one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest Sikh temples was opened at a cost of £12 million.

==Education==
In secondary education, Gravesend has the following schools: Gravesend Grammar School; Northfleet School for Girls; Northfleet Technology College (Northfleet School for Boys, on the former sites of Northfleet Secondary School for Boys and Gravesend Technical High School for Boys); Mayfield Grammar School (formerly Gravesend Grammar School for Girls); St John&#x27;s Catholic Comprehensive School; Thamesview School and St George&#x27;s Church of England School. There are also primary age schools such as Whitehill Primary School, special schools and several independent schools, such as Bronte School and St Joseph&#x27;s.

==Health==
Gravesend Hospital was opened in 1854, following the donation of a site by the 6th Earl of Darnley in 1853; it had its origin on 2 December 1850, as a dispensary on the Milton Road &quot;to assist the really destitute poor of Gravesend and Milton and vicinities ... unable to pay for medical aid&quot;. By 1893, 4,699 such people had benefited by its presence.

In 2004 the original building, and parts of the newer buildings were demolished to make way for a new community hospital. Gravesend Community Hospital provides a Minor Injury Unit, Dental services, Speech and Language therapy and Physiotherapy. It also has a Stroke Ward and offers inpatient care. The outpatient department provides care for much of the local area and is separate from those offered at Darent Valley Hospital. In addition, Gravesend emergency doctors out of hours service as well as podiatry are offered.

In the town centre is a large medical clinic at Swan Yard, next to the Market car park, and several other doctors&#x27; surgeries are located in the area.

==Sport==
===Football===
The Stonebridge Road football ground at neighbouring Northfleet is home to Ebbsfleet United F.C., which changed its name from Gravesend and Northfleet F.C. in June 2007. Ebbsfleet currently plays in the National League, and the club won the FA Trophy in May 2008. An agreement was reached for the MyFootballClub online community to purchase a 75% stake in the club in November 2007, and its takeover was completed early in 2008.

===Cricket===
Gravesend Cricket Club (founded in 1881 when the Harkaway and Clarence Cricket Clubs amalgamated) is based at the Bat and Ball Ground on Wrotham Road, where cricket has been played since its foundation at the behest of the 6th Earl of Darnley (grandfather of the celebrated England cricketer, The Hon. Ivo Bligh, later 8th Earl of Darnley) in the mid 19th century.

===Rugby union===
Gravesend has two rugby union teams, Gravesend Rugby Football Club and Old Gravesendians RFC, which are situated next to each other opposite the Gravesend Grammar School.

Old Gravesendians RFC (founded in 1929) consisted traditionally of former Gravesend Grammar School pupils. Prior to the forming of Old Gravesendians RFC, on leaving the Grammar School, former pupils had continued to engage in various sports through the Old Blues Association (founded in 1914). Owing to World War I the Old Blues Association practically went to pieces with only one annual dinner having been held in 1914. After the war a reunion dinner was held in 1920, the second annual dinner, which restarted the Old Blues Association activities. The Old Gravesendians RFC was often referred to as &#x27;Gravesend Old Blues&#x27; in match reports.

Old Gravesendians RFC continued to foster rugby in Gravesend during World War II by turning out a side every season. Since 2000 Old Gravesendians (Old G&#x27;s) have reached six Kent Plate finals, winning two. They achieved promotion to London League rugby in 2009, but were relegated in 2009–10. Old G&#x27;s put out three sides with the first team playing in Shepherd Neame Kent 1 during the 2018–19 season. The team colours are light blue and dark blue.

===Rowing===
Rowing races have been held on the River Thames at Gravesend since at least 1698, with the first organised Regatta recorded in 1715. The first Borough Regatta began in 1882, setting the pattern for an annual event on the River Thames that is carried on to this day. The River Thames in Gravesend is home to the Gravesend Rowing Club (founded in 1878), which the club claims is the oldest existing sporting club in Gravesend, the Regatta Committee&#x27;s skiff rowers, and Gravesend Sailing Club.

===Cycling===
To the south of Gravesend on the ancient site of Watling Street on 43ha of land adjacent to the A2, Cyclopark, a venue for cycling events and other activities has been developed. The site which features mountain bike trails, a road circuit, a BMX racetrack and family cycling paths was formally opened in early 2012.

==Culture==

The Gravesend Historical Society meets regularly and produces a biannual magazine on its activities.

Charles Dickens lived at Gad&#x27;s Hill Place, 2 miles (3.2 km) east of Gravesend and specifically mentions the town and its environs in at least three of his novels. In &quot;David Copperfield&quot; Mr. Peggotty, Ham and the Micawbers say their goodbyes and sail away from Gravesend to begin a new life in Australia. In &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Pip, with accomplices, rows Magwitch from London downriver in expectation of waylaying a regular steamer (whilst under way in the Lower Hope, off Gravesend) bound for Hamburg. At St James&#x27; Church, in Cooling, Pip finds Magwitch hidden among the graves. Gravesend also appears in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;).

Gravesend is briefly mentioned in the 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by Mary Shelley during Victor&#x27;s travels through the United Kingdom with Clerval; ultimately culminating in Victor&#x27;s residence in the Orkney Islands.

Arthur Conan Doyle often mentioned Gravesend in his Sherlock Holmes stories.

In the 1902 novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; by Joseph Conrad, Charles Marlow&#x27;s ship, anchored off Gravesend, is the setting where he tells his tale.

The 1952 film &quot;The Long Memory&quot; starring John Mills was filmed in and around Gravesend. It features many squalid streets running down towards the river that even then were being progressively cleared for redevelopment. It is also possible to hear in the background steam engines working out of the now closed Gravesend West Line West Street terminus.

&quot;The War Game&quot; was a 1965 BBC television drama-documentary film depicting a nuclear war that was initially banned, and not broadcast until July 1985. The film was shot in Gravesend and in the other Kent towns of Tonbridge, Chatham and Dover, with a cast which was almost entirely made up of non-actors.

<doc id="312864" wikidata="Q1178242" url="?curid=312864" title="Cattle in religion and mythology">
<text>There are varying beliefs about cattle in societies and religions.

Cattle are considered sacred in the Indian religions of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, as well as in some Chinese folk religion and in African paganism. Cattle played other major roles in many religions, including those of ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, ancient Israel, and ancient Rome.

In some regions, especially most states of India, the slaughter of cattle is prohibited and their meat (beef) may be taboo.

== In Indian religions ==
Legislation against the slaughter of cattle is in place throughout most states of India except Kerala and parts of the North-East.

=== Hinduism ===


Hinduism specifically considers the zebu (&quot;Bos indicus&quot;) to be sacred. Respect for the lives of animals including cattle, diet in Hinduism and vegetarianism in India are based on the Hindu ethics. The Hindu ethics are driven by the core concept of Ahimsa, i.e. non-violence towards all beings, as mentioned in the Chandogya Upanishad (~ 800 BCE). By mid 1st millennium BCE, all three major religions – Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism – were championing non-violence as an ethical value, and something that impacted one&#x27;s rebirth. By about 200 CE, food and feasting on animal slaughter were widely considered as a form of violence against life forms, and became a religious and social taboo. India, which has 79.80% Hindu population as of (2011 census), had the lowest rate of meat consumption in the world according to the 2007 UN FAO statistics, and India has more vegetarians than the rest of the world put together.

According to Ludwig Alsdorf, &quot;Indian vegetarianism is unequivocally based on &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-violence)&quot; as evidenced by ancient &quot;smritis&quot; and other ancient texts of Hinduism.&quot; He adds that the endearment and respect for cattle in Hinduism is more than a commitment to vegetarianism and has become integral to its theology. The respect for cattle is widespread but not universal. Animal sacrifices have been rare among the Hindus outside a few eastern states. To the majority of modern Indians, states Alsdorf, respect for cattle and disrespect for slaughter is a part of their ethos and there is &quot;no &quot;ahimsa&quot; without renunciation of meat consumption&quot;.

The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure, and Hindu society honours the cow as a symbol of unselfish giving, selfless sacrifice, gentleness and tolerance.

Several scholars explain the veneration for cows among Hindus in economic terms, including the importance of dairy in the diet, the use of cow dung as fuel and fertilizer, and the importance that cattle have historically played in agriculture. Ancient texts such as Rig Veda, Puranas highlight the importance of cattle. The scope, extent and status of cows throughout ancient India is a subject of debate. Cattle, including cows, were neither inviolable nor as revered in ancient times as they were later. A &quot;Gryhasutra&quot; recommends that beef be eaten by the mourners after a funeral ceremony as a ritual rite of passage. In contrast, the Vedic literature is contradictory, with some suggesting ritual slaughter and meat consumption, while others suggesting a taboo on meat eating.

==== Sacred status of cow ====

Many ancient and medieval Hindu texts debate the rationale for a voluntary stop to cow slaughter and the pursuit of vegetarianism as a part of a general abstention from violence against others and all killing of animals.

The interdiction of the meat of the bounteous cow as food was regarded as the first step to total vegetarianism. Dairy cows are called &quot;aghnya&quot; &quot;that which may not be slaughtered&quot; in Rigveda. Yaska, the early commentator of the Rigveda, gives nine names for cow, the first being &quot;aghnya&quot;. The literature relating to cow veneration became common in 1st millennium CE, and by about 1000 CE vegetarianism, along with a taboo against beef, became a well accepted mainstream Hindu tradition. This practice was inspired by the beliefs in Hinduism that a soul is present in all living beings, life in all its forms is interconnected, and non-violence towards all creatures is the highest ethical value. The god Krishna and his Yadav kinsmen are associated with cows, adding to its endearment.

The cow veneration in ancient India during the Vedic era, the religious texts written during this period called for non-violence towards all bipeds and quadrupeds, and often equated killing of a cow with the killing of a human being specifically a Brahmin. The hymn 8.3.25 of the Hindu scripture &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; (~1200–1500 BCE) condemns all killings of men, cattle, and horses, and prays to god Agni to punish those who kill.

In Puranas, which are part of the Hindu texts, the earth-goddess Prithvi was in the form of a cow, successively milked of beneficent substances for the benefit of humans, by deities starting with the first sovereign: Prithu milked the cow to generate crops for humans to end a famine. Kamadhenu, the miraculous &quot;cow of plenty&quot; and the &quot;mother of cows&quot; in certain versions of the Hindu mythology, is believed to represent the generic sacred cow, regarded as the source of all prosperity. In the 19th century, a form of Kamadhenu was depicted in poster-art that depicted all major gods and goddesses in it. Govatsa Dwadashi which marks the first day of Diwali celebrations, is the main festival connected to the veneration and worship of cows as chief source of livelihood and religious sanctity in India, wherein the symbolism of motherhood is most apparent with the sacred cows Kamadhenu and her daughter Nandini.

=== Historical significance ===

The reverence for the cow played a role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British East India Company. Hindu and Muslim sepoys in the army of the East India Company came to believe that their paper cartridges, which held a measured amount of gunpowder, were greased with cow and pig fat. The consumption of swine is forbidden in Islam and Judaism. Because loading the gun required biting off the end of the paper cartridge, they concluded that the British were forcing them to break edicts of their religion.

A historical survey of major communal riots in India between 1717 and 1977 revealed that 22 out of 167 incidents of rioting between Hindus and Muslims were attributable directly to cow slaughter.

==== In Gandhi&#x27;s teachings ====
The cow protection was a symbol of animal rights and of non-violence against all life forms for Gandhi. He venerated cows, and suggested ending cow slaughter to be the first step to stopping violence against all animals. He said: &quot;I worship it and I shall defend its worship against the whole world&quot;, and stated that &quot;The central fact of Hinduism is cow protection.&quot;

===Jainism===

Jainism is against violence to all living beings, including cattle. According to the Jaina sutras, humans must avoid all killing and slaughter because all living beings are fond of life, they suffer, they feel pain, they like to live, and long to live. All beings should help each other live and prosper, according to Jainism, not kill and slaughter each other.

In the Jain religious tradition, neither monks nor laypersons should cause others or allow others to work in a slaughterhouse. Jains believe that vegetarian sources can provide adequate nutrition, without creating suffering for animals such as cattle. According to some Jain scholars, slaughtering cattle increases ecological burden from human food demands since the production of meat entails intensified grain demands, and reducing cattle slaughter by 50 percent would free up enough land and ecological resources to solve all malnutrition and hunger worldwide. The Jain community leaders, states Christopher Chapple, has actively campaigned to stop all forms of animal slaughter including cattle.

=== Meitei religion and mythology ===
In ancient Meitei mythology and folklore of Ancient Manipur (Kangleipak), Kao is a divine cattle that plays a significant role in the legend of the Khamba Thoibi epic of ancient Moirang realm. Nongban Kongyamba, a nobleman, acting as an oracler, prophesied that calamities would arrive at the kingdom of Moirang, if the powerful Kao roaming freely in the Khuman kingdom, wasn&#x27;t offered to God Thangjing (), the guardian deity of Moirang. Spreading the rumour, Nongban chose Khamba, the orphan Khuman prince, on purpose to eliminate him, as the two were rivals. Before encountering the dangerous divine bull, Khamba&#x27;s elder sister Khamnu disclosed to Khamba the secrets of the bull, with whose help he succeeded in capturing the bull.

===Buddhism===
The texts of Buddhism state ahimsa to be one of five ethical precepts, which requires a practicing Buddhist to &quot;refrain from killing living beings&quot;. Slaughtering cow has been a taboo, with some texts suggesting that taking care of a cow is a means of taking care of &quot;all living beings&quot;. Cattle are seen in some Buddhist sects as a form of reborn human beings in the endless rebirth cycles in samsara, protecting animal life and being kind to cattle and other animals is good karma. Not only do some, mainly Mahayana, Buddhist texts state that killing or eating meat is wrong, it urges Buddhist laypersons to not operate slaughterhouses, nor trade in meat. Indian Buddhist texts encourage a plant-based diet.

According to Saddhatissa, in the &quot;Brahmanadhammika Sutta&quot;, the Buddha &quot;describes the ideal mode of life of Brahmins in the Golden Age&quot; before him as follows:

Saving animals from slaughter for meat, is believed in Buddhism to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. According to Richard Gombrich, there has been a gap between Buddhist precepts and practice. Vegetarianism is admired, states Gombrich, but often it is not practiced. Nevertheless, adds Gombrich, there is a general belief among Theravada Buddhists that eating beef is worse than other meat and the ownership of cattle slaughterhouses by Buddhists is relatively rare.

Meat eating remains controversial within Buddhism, with most Theravada sects allowing it, reflecting early Buddhist practice, and most Mahayana sects forbidding it. Early suttas indicate that the Buddha himself ate meat and was clear that no rule should be introduced to forbid meat eating to monks. The consumption, however, appears to have been limited to pork, chicken and fish and may well have excluded cattle.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Judaism===
According to the Bible, the Israelites worshipped a cult image of a golden calf when the prophet Moses went up to Mount Sinai.
Moses considered this a great sin against God. As a result of their abstention from the act, the Levite tribe attained a priestly role.
A cult of golden calves appears later during the rule of Jeroboam.

According to the Hebrew Bible, an unblemished red cow was an important part of ancient Jewish rituals. The cow was sacrificed and burned in a precise ritual, and the ashes were added to water used in the ritual purification of a person who had come in to contact with a human corpse. The ritual is described in the Book of Numbers in Chapter 19, verses 1–14.

Observant Jews study this passage every year as part of the weekly Torah portion called Chukat. A contemporary Jewish organization called the Temple Institute is trying to revive this ancient religious observance.

Traditional Judaism considers beef kosher and permissible as food, as long as the cow is slaughtered in a religious ritual called &quot;shechita&quot;, and the meat is not served in a meal that includes any dairy foods.

Some Jews committed to Jewish vegetarianism believe that Jews should refrain from slaughtering animals altogether and have condemned widespread cruelty towards cattle on factory farms.

===Islam===
Islam allows the slaughter of cows and consumption of beef, as long as the cow is slaughtered in a religious ritual called &quot;dhabīḥah&quot; or &quot;zabiha&quot; similar to the Jewish &quot;shechita&quot;.

Although slaughter of cattle plays a role in a major Muslim holiday, Eid al-Adha, many rulers of the Mughal Empire had imposed a ban on the slaughter of cows owing to the large Hindu and Jain populations living under their rule.

The second and longest surah of the Quran is named Al-Baqara (&quot;The Cow&quot;). Out of the 286 verses of the surah, 7 mention cows (Al Baqarah 67–73). The name of the surah derives from this passage in which Moses orders his people to sacrifice a cow in order to resurrect a man murdered by an unknown person. Per the passage, the &quot;Children of Israel&quot; quibbled over what kind of cow was meant when the sacrifice was ordered.

While addressing to children of Israel, it was said:


Classical Sunni and Shia commentators recount several variants of this tale. Per some of the commentators, though any cow would have been acceptable, but after they &quot;created hardships for themselves&quot; and the cow was finally specified, it was necessary to obtain it at any cost.

===Christianity===
The red heifer or red cow is a particular kind of cow brought to priests for sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible. Jews and some Christian fundamentalists believe that once a red heifer is born they will be able to rebuild the Third Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

Oxen are one of the animals sacrificed by Greek Orthodox believers in some villages of Greece. It is specially associated to the feast of Saint Charalambos. This practice of kourbania has been repeatedly criticized by church authorities.

The ox is the symbol of Luke the Evangelist.

Among the Visigoths, the oxen pulling the wagon with the corpse of Saint Emilian lead to the correct burial site (San Millán de la Cogolla, La Rioja).

==Zoroastrianism==

The term &quot;geush urva&quot; means &quot;the spirit of the cow&quot; and is interpreted as the soul of the earth. In the Ahunavaiti Gatha, Zoroaster accuses some of his co-religionists of abusing the cow while Ahura Mazda tells him to protect them. After fleeing to India, many Zoroastrians stopped eating beef out of respect for Hindus living there.

The lands of Zoroaster and the Vedic priests were those of cattle breeders. The 9th chapter of the &quot;Vendidad&quot; of the &quot;Avesta&quot; expounds the purificatory power of cow urine. It is declared to be a panacea for all bodily and moral evils and features prominently in the 9-night purification ritual Barashnûm.

==Ancient societies==

=== Egypt ===
In ancient Egyptian religion, bulls symbolized strength and male sexuality and were linked with aggressive deities such as Montu and virile deities such as Min. Some Egyptian cities kept sacred bulls that were said to be incarnations of divine powers, including the Mnevis bull, Buchis bull, and the Apis bull, which was regarded as a manifestation of the god Ptah and was the most important sacred animal in Egypt. Cows were connected with fertility and motherhood. One of several ancient Egyptian creation myths said that a cow goddess, Mehet-Weret, who represented the primeval waters that existed before creation, gave birth to the sun at the beginning of time. The sky was sometimes envisioned as a goddess in the form of a cow, and several goddesses, including Hathor, Nut, and Neith, were equated with this celestial cow.

The Egyptians did not regard cattle as uniformly positive. Wild bulls, regarded as symbols of the forces of chaos, could be hunted and ritually killed.

=== Nubia ===
As cattle were a central part of the pastoralist economy of Ancient Nubia, Africa, they also played a prominent role in their culture and mythology, as evidenced by their inclusion in burials and rock art. Starting in the Neolithic period, cattle skulls, also known as bucrania, were often placed alongside human burials. Bucrania were a status symbol, and they were used frequently in adult male burials, occasionally in adult female burials, and rarely in child burials. In cemeteries at Kerma, there is a strong correlation between the number of bucrania and the quantity and lavishness of other grave goods. Dozens if not hundreds of cattle were often slaughtered as tribute for the burial of one individual; 400 bucrania were found at one tumulus alone at Kerma. The use of cattle skulls rather than those of sheep or goats reveals the importance of cattle in their pastoral economy, as well as the cultural associations of cattle with wealth, prosperity, and passage into the afterlife. Sometimes complete cattle were buried alongside their owner, symbolic of their relationship continuing into the afterlife.

Beginning in the third millennium BCE, cattle became the most popular motif in Nubian rock art. The bodies are usually depicted in profile, while the horns are facing forward. The length and shape of the horns and the pattern on the hide varied widely. Human silhouettes are often drawn alongside the cattle, symbolic of the important symbiotic relationship between cattle and humans. For pastoralists, drawing cattle may have also been a way to ensure the health of their herd. The role of cattle in Nubian mythology is more covert than in Egypt to the north, where several gods are often depicted as cattle; however, the significance of cattle in Nubian culture is evident in burial practices, understandings of the afterlife, and rock art.

=== Ancient Mediterranean Europe ===

In Greek mythology, the Cattle of Helios pastured on the island of Thrinacia, which is believed to be modern Sicily. Helios, the sun god, is said to have had seven herds of oxen and seven flocks of sheep, each numbering fifty head. A hecatomb was a sacrifice to the gods Apollo, Athena, and Hera, of 100 cattle (&quot;hekaton&quot; = one hundred).

The Greek gods also transformed themselves or others into cattle as a form of deception or punishment, such as in the myths of Io and Europa. In the myth of Pasiphaë, she falls in love with a bull as punishment by Poseidon. She gives birth to the Minotaur, a human-bull hybrid.

In the ancient Anatolian civilization Hatti, the storm god was closely linked to a bull.

=== Ancient northern and central Europe ===

Tarvos Trigaranus (the &quot;bull with three cranes&quot;) is pictured on ancient Gaulish reliefs alongside images of gods. There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, which were almost always cattle or other livestock. Early medieval Irish texts mention the &quot;tarbfeis&quot; (bull feast), a shamanistic ritual in which a bull would be sacrificed and a seer would sleep in the bull&#x27;s hide to have a vision of the future king.

Cattle appear often in Irish mythology. The Glas Gaibhnenn is a mythical prized cow that could produce plentiful supplies of milk, while Donn Cuailnge and Finnbhennach are prized bulls that play a central role in the epic &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (&quot;The Cattle Raid of Cooley&quot;). The mythical lady Flidais, the main figure in the &quot;Táin Bó Flidhais&quot;, owns a herd of magical cattle. The name of the goddess of the River Boyne, Bóinn, comes from Archaic Irish &quot;*Bóu-vinda&quot; meaning the &quot;bright or white cow&quot;; while the name of the Corcu Loígde means &quot;tribe of the calf goddess&quot;.

In Norse mythology, the primeval cow Auðumbla suckled Ymir, the ancestor of the frost giants, and licked Búri, Odin&#x27;s grandfather and ancestor of the gods, out of the ice.

==Modern day==
Today, in Hindu-majority countries like India and Nepal, bovine milk holds a key part of religious rituals. For some, it is customary to boil milk on a stove or lead a cow through the house as part of a housewarming ceremony.

===In India===

The Constitution of India mandates the protection of cows in India. The slaughter of cattle is allowed with restrictions (like a &#x27;fit-for-slaughter&#x27; certificate which may be issued depending on factors like age and gender of cattle, continued economic viability, etc.), but only for bulls and buffaloes and not cows in fourteen states. It is completely banned in six states with pending litigation in the supreme court to overturn the ban, while there is no restriction in many states.

Gopastami, a holiday celebrated by the Hindus once a year, is one of the few instances where cows receive prayers in modern-day India. While the cow is still respected and honored by most of the Indian population, there has been controversy over the treatment of the cows during the holiday.

===In Nepal===
In Nepal, a Hindu-majority country, slaughtering of cows and bulls is completely banned. Cows are considered like the Goddess Lakshmi (goddess of wealth and prosperity). The Nepalese have a festival called Tihar (Diwali) during which, on one day called Gaipuja, they perform prayers for cows.

According to a &quot;Lodi News-Sentinel&quot; news story written in the 1960s, in then contemporary Nepal an individual could serve three months in jail for killing a pedestrian, but one year for injuring a cow, and life imprisonment for killing a cow.

Cows roam freely and are sacred. Buffalo slaughtering was done in Nepal at specific Hindu events, such as at the Gadhimai festival, last held in 2014. In 2015, Nepal&#x27;s temple trust on announced to cancel all future animal sacrifice at the country&#x27;s Gadhimai festival.

===In Myanmar===
The beef taboo is fairly widespread in Myanmar, particularly in the Buddhist community. In Myanmar, beef is typically obtained from cattle that are slaughtered at the end of their working lives (16 years of age) or from sick animals. Cattle is rarely raised for meat; 58% of cattle in the country is used for draught animal power (DAP). Few people eat beef, and there is a general dislike of beef (especially among the Bamar and Burmese Chinese), although it is more commonly eaten in regional cuisines, particularly those of ethnic minorities like the Kachin. Buddhists, when giving up meat during the Buddhist (Vassa) or Uposatha days, will forego beef first. Almost all butchers are Muslim because of the Buddhist doctrine of ahimsa (no harm).

During the country&#x27;s last dynasty, the Konbaung dynasty, habitual consumption of beef was punishable by public flogging.

In 1885, Ledi Sayadaw, a prominent Buddhist monk wrote the &quot;Nwa-myitta-sa&quot; (), a poetic prose letter that argued that Burmese Buddhists should not kill cattle and eat beef, because Burmese farmers depended on them as beasts of burden to maintain their livelihoods, that the marketing of beef for human consumption threatened the extinction of buffalo and cattle, and that the practice was ecologically unsound. He subsequently led successful beef boycotts during the colonial era, despite the presence of beef eating among locals, and influenced a generation of Burmese nationalists in adopting this stance.

On 29 August 1961, the Burmese Parliament passed the State Religion Promotion Act of 1961, which explicitly banned the slaughtering of cattle nationwide (beef became known as &quot;todo tha&quot; (); lit. hush hush meat). Religious groups, such as Muslims, were required to apply for exemption licences to slaughter cattle on religious holidays. This ban was repealed a year later, after Ne Win led a coup d&#x27;état and declared martial law in the country.

===In Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, in May 2013, 30-year-old Buddhist monk Bowatte Indrarathana Thera of the Sri Sugatha Purana Vihara self immolated to protest the government allowing religious minorities to slaughter cows.

===China===
A beef taboo in ancient China was historically a dietary restriction, particularly among the Han Chinese, as oxen and buffalo (bovines) are useful in farming and are respected. During the Zhou dynasty, they were not often eaten, even by emperors. Some emperors banned killing cows. Beef is not recommended in Chinese medicine, as it is considered a hot food and is thought to disrupt the body&#x27;s internal balance.

In written sources (including anecdotes and Daoist liturgical texts), this taboo first appeared in the 9th to 12th centuries (Tang-Song transition, with the advent of pork meat.) By the 16th to 17th centuries, the beef taboo had become well accepted in the framework of Chinese morality and was found in morality books (善書), with several books dedicated exclusively to this taboo. The beef taboo came from a Chinese perspective that relates the respect for animal life and vegetarianism (ideas shared by Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism, and state protection for draught animals.) In Chinese society, only ethnic and religious groups not fully assimilated (such as the Muslim Huis and the Miao) and foreigners consumed this meat. This taboo, among Han Chinese, led Chinese Muslims to create a niche for themselves as butchers who specialized in slaughtering oxen and buffalo.

Occasionally, some cows seen weeping before slaughter are often released to temples nearby.
===Taiwan===
Due to water buffalo being the primary working animal for farming, beef consumption was generally considered a taboo in early 20th century. This gradually changed with Japanese rule, the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, the mechanization of farming, and the economy transitioning away from farming. Most Taiwanese people today consume beef, although some have maintained the tradition.

===Japan===

Historically, there was a beef taboo in ancient Japan, as a means of protecting the livestock population and due to Buddhist influence. Meat-eating had long been taboo in Japan, beginning with a decree in 675 that banned the consumption of cattle, horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens, influenced by the Buddhist prohibition of killing. In 1612, the shōgun declared a decree that specifically banned the killing of cattle.

This official prohibition was in place until 1872, when it was officially proclaimed that Emperor Meiji consumed beef and mutton, which transformed the country&#x27;s dietary considerations as a means of modernizing the country, particularly with regard to consumption of beef. With contact from Europeans, beef increasingly became popular, even though it had previously been considered barbaric.

Several shrines and temples are decorated with cow figurines, which are believed to cure illnesses when stroked.

===Indonesia===
In Kudus, Indonesia, Muslims still maintain the tradition of not slaughtering or eating cows, out of respect for their ancestors, some of who were Hindus, allegedly imitating Sunan Kudus who also did as such.

==Leather==
In religiously diverse countries, leather vendors are typically careful to clarify the kinds of leather used in their products. For example, leather shoes will bear a label identifying the animal from which the leather was taken. In this way, a Muslim would not accidentally purchase pigskin leather, and a Hindu could avoid cow leather. Many Hindus who are vegetarians will not use any kind of leather.

Judaism forbids the wearing of shoes made with leather on Yom Kippur, Tisha B&#x27;Av, and during mourning.

Jainism prohibits the use of leather because it is obtained by killing animals.

<text>In algebraic geometry and related areas of mathematics, local analysis is the practice of looking at a problem relative to each prime number &quot;p&quot; first, and then later trying to integrate the information gained at each prime into a &#x27;global&#x27; picture. These are forms of the localization approach.

==Group theory==
In group theory, local analysis was started by the Sylow theorems, which contain significant information about the structure of a finite group &quot;G&quot; for each prime number &quot;p&quot; dividing the order of &quot;G&quot;. This area of study was enormously developed in the quest for the classification of finite simple groups, starting with the Feit–Thompson theorem that groups of odd order are solvable.

==Number theory==
In number theory one may study a Diophantine equation, for example, modulo &quot;p&quot; for all primes &quot;p&quot;, looking for constraints on solutions. The next step is to look modulo prime powers, and then for solutions in the &quot;p&quot;-adic field. This kind of local analysis provides conditions for solution that are &quot;necessary&quot;. In cases where local analysis (plus the condition that there are real solutions) provides also &quot;sufficient&quot; conditions, one says that the &quot;Hasse principle&quot; holds: this is the best possible situation. It does for quadratic forms, but certainly not in general (for example for elliptic curves). The point of view that one would like to understand what extra conditions are needed has been very influential, for example for cubic forms.

Some form of local analysis underlies both the standard applications of the Hardy–Littlewood circle method in analytic number theory, and the use of adele rings, making this one of the unifying principles across number theory.

<text>The Battle of San Juan Hill (), also known as the Battle for the San Juan Heights, was a major battle of the Spanish–American War fought between an American force under the command of William Rufus Shafter and Joseph Wheeler against a Spanish force led by Arsenio Linares y Pombo. The combined assaults on Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill that together form San Juan Heights proved to be one of the most significant battles of the war and, along with the Siege of Santiago, a decisive battle in deciding the fate of the United States Army campaign in Cuba. The American forces, outnumbering the Spanish defenders 16-to-one, charged upon the heights and dispersed the Spanish after suffering heavy casualties.

Tensions between Spain and the United States worsened over Spanish behavior during their efforts to quell the Cuban War of Independence, with many Americans being agitated by exaggerated reports of Spanish atrocities against the Cuban population. In January 1898, fearing the fate of American interests in Cuba due to the war, the cruiser USS &quot;Maine&quot; was dispatched to protect them. Less than a month later, the cruiser exploded while lying at anchor in Havana harbor, killing 267 sailors onboard and inflaming American opinion, with Spain being portrayed as the culprit in the American media without conclusive evidence. Two months later, war was declared.

The Americans, after already landing troops in the Battle of Guantánamo Bay, moved inland to seek a decisive encounter with the Spanish forces. Both sides drew blood at the Battle of Las Guasimas, with the Spanish moving to defend the strategically valuable San Juan Heights from the Americans. A week later, a significantly larger American force, including the famed &quot;Rough Riders&quot;, moved to clear the heights of the Spanish. After enduring artillery fire which inflicted heavy casualties, the Americans charged up the hill and dispersed the Spanish, suffering even more heavily in the process. The fight for the heights proved to be the bloodiest and most famous battle of the war.

The battle also proved to be the location of the &quot;greatest victory&quot; for the Rough Riders, as stated by the press and its new commander, Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt returned to New York and was promptly elected governor. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 2001 for his actions in Cuba and became the only U.S. president to receive the award. 

The Americans won another engagement at El Caney the same day, with both battles highlighting the bravery and skill of the American/Cuban forces, as well as the Spanish defenders. Following the surrender of the Spanish army at Santiago, they agreed to depart Cuba, ending over four centuries of Spanish rule.

== Background ==

Spanish General Arsenio Linares ordered 760 Spanish Army regular troops to hold the San Juan heights against an American offensive on July 1, 1898. For unclear reasons, Linares failed to reinforce this position, choosing to hold nearly 10,000 Spanish reserves in the city of Santiago de Cuba.

Spanish hilltop entrenchments, while typically well-concealed, were not all correctly positioned for plunging fire, which made return fire at the advancing Americans more difficult. Most of the Spanish fortifications and trench lines were laid out along the geographic crest of the heights instead of the military crest. This meant that the fire from the Spanish troops would have difficulty hitting the advancing enemy when the attacking Americans reached the defilade at the foot of the heights. Once they began scaling the hill, however, the attackers would be in full view of the defenders, who could engage the Americans with both rifle and artillery fire.

Most Spanish troops were recently arrived conscripts, but their officers were skilled in fighting Cuban insurgents. The Spanish were well equipped with supporting artillery, and all Spanish soldiers were armed with 7 mm Mauser M1893 rifles, a modern repeating bolt-action weapon with a high rate of fire that was chambered in the high-velocity smokeless powder 7mm Mauser cartridge. This rifle was faster to reload than the American Krag. Spanish artillery units were armed mainly with modern rapid-fire breech-loading cannon, again using smokeless powder.

The American regular forces and troopers were armed with bolt-action Krag rifles chambered in the smokeless .30 Army caliber. However the soldiers of the 24th and 25th Colored Infantry (Buffalo Soldiers) still used the single shot Springfield Model 1873 (Trapdoor) which fired the .45-70 black powder cartridge. While the Rough Rider&#x27;s troopers carried the Krag, each Rough Rider officer was equipped with a .30 Army caliber M1895 Winchester lever-action rifle, courtesy of Col. Roosevelt. However, U.S. 3.2-inch artillery pieces were of an outmoded design, with a slow rate of fire due to bag powder charges and lack of a recoil mechanism. They also used less powerful black powder charges, which limited the effective range of support fire for U.S. troops. The Americans also had a four-gun Gatling Gun Detachment commanded by Lt. John Henry Parker. Parker&#x27;s men were equipped with four Colt Model 1895 Gatlings in .30 Army caliber. Although these guns were hand-cranked, they were nevertheless capable of 700 rpm or more in continuous fire, and were equipped with swivel mounts to allow greater field of fire coverage.

General William Rufus Shafter commanded Fifth Army Corps, of about 15,000 troops in three divisions. Jacob F. Kent commanded the corps&#x27; 1st Division (brigade and division numbers in this era were only unique within their parent formation), while Henry W. Lawton commanded the 2nd Division. Joseph Wheeler commanded the dismounted Cavalry Division but was suffering from fever and had to turn over command to General Samuel S. Sumner. Shafter&#x27;s plans to attack Santiago de Cuba called for Lawton&#x27;s division to move north and reduce the Spanish stronghold at El Caney, a task which was to take about two hours. Then they were to join with the rest of the troops for the attack on the San Juan Heights. The remaining two divisions would move directly against the San Juan heights, with Sumner in the center and Kent to the south. Shafter, too ill to personally direct the operations, set up his headquarters at El Pozo from the heights and communicated via mounted staff officers.

The American assault line consisted of the following regiments: From the far left, attacking what later became known as San Juan Hill, was the 6th Infantry, the 9th Infantry, the 13th Infantry, the 16th Infantry, the 24th (Colored) Infantry, the 10th (Colored) Cavalry (the 10th was the only unit that assaulted both high points on the San Juan heights), with the 3rd Cavalry, 1st Volunteer Cavalry on the far right, attacking what later became known as Kettle Hill.

== The Battle ==
=== Initial troops cross the San Juan River and are pinned down ===
A company from the Signal Corps ascended in a hot air balloon to reconnoiter the hills. The balloon made a good target for the Spaniards. Hawkins&#x27; brigade had already passed by the newfound route and Kent ordered forward the brigade under Colonel Charles A. Wikoff. Wikoff began heading down the trail at noon, and 30 minutes later he emerged from the woods and was struck by a Mauser bullet. He died as his staff officers carried him to the rear. Lt. Col. William S. Worth, next in rank, assumed command, but within five minutes fell wounded. Lt. Col. Emerson Liscom assumed command and within another five minutes received a disabling wound. Lt. Col. Ezra P. Ewers, fourth in command of the brigade, assumed command. Kent and Sumner lined up for the attack and waited for Lawton&#x27;s division to arrive from El Caney. Lawton did not arrive as scheduled, and no orders came from either Shafter or Wheeler. Crossing the San Juan River, increasing numbers of troops waited at the base of San Juan Hill. Waiting for orders, they were plagued by constant Spanish Mauser gunfire firing down at them from San Juan Heights. The troops would call their precarious position, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Pocket&quot; and &quot;Bloody Ford&quot;.

==== The Attack on San Juan Hill ====
As men waited at the base of the hill, General Hamilton Hawkins&#x27; 1st Infantry Brigade was preparing to assault San Juan Hill, the higher of the two hilltops forming San Juan Heights. The southernmost point was most recognizable for the Spanish blockhouse, a defensive fort that dominated the crest. The Cavalry Brigade then moved into position. Continuing to wait for orders from General Shafter, the Americans suffered casualties from rifle and artillery fire. As the volume of fire increased, officers began to agitate for action.

The 2nd and 10th Infantry regiments of the 2nd Brigade were ordered by the brigade commander, Col. E. P. Pearson, to advance towards the Spanish lines. Positioned on the far left of the American line, the two regiments moved forward in good order, advanced towards a small knoll on the Spanish right flank, and drove groups of Spanish skirmishers back towards their trenches. A former brigade staff officer, First Lieutenant Jules Garesche Ord (son of General E. O. C. Ord), officially of the 6th Infantry Regiment but temporarily assigned to D Company of the 10th due to sick and heat-disabled officers in the Fifth Corps, made a special request to General Hawkins. &quot;General, if you will order a charge, I will lead it.&quot; Hawkins responded, &quot;I will not ask for volunteers, I will not give permission and I will not refuse it,&quot; he said. &quot;God bless you and good luck!&quot; Lt. Ord then asked the leaders to the right of the 10th Cavalry (members of the 3rd and 1st Volunteers) to &quot;support the regulars&quot; when they charged the heights. When Ord returned to his assigned unit, he advised his commander, Captain John Bigelow Jr. of D Troop, of his conversation with the general. Bigelow gave the honor to sound the advance to Lt. Ord. With a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other, Ord stood up and ordered the advance of his unit. The Buffalo Soldiers (members of the 10th Cavalry Regiment) moved out of the trenches and up the hill. Units to the right began moving forward in a ripple effect to support the regulars. To the left of the 10th, a cheer went out from members of the 24th all-black Infantry Regiment, and they too moved toward the top of the heights. They were accompanied by elements of the 6th Infantry Regiment, including E Company, led by Capt. L. W. V. Kennon, as well as units from the 9th and 13th Infantry Regiments. The 16th Infantry followed some distance behind the lead formations, while the 71st (New York Volunteer) infantry regiment, having failed to initially advance with the other regiments, remained at the rear. As the units began their advance up the hill, they became separated, with the battalions of some regiments placed between those of other regiments.

The Fifth Corps&#x27; newly formed Gatling Gun Detachment participated in the U.S. Army&#x27;s first use of machine gun fire for mobile fire support in offensive combat. Because U.S. black-powder artillery pieces lacked the range to reach the Spanish positions, Lt. John Parker&#x27;s Gatling battery of four .30 caliber 10-barrelled guns was originally conceived as providing covering fire for the artillery trains. The Gatling Gun Detachment was ordered to move forward in support of the U.S. assault, and Lt. Parker received orders from his colonel to detach one gun to General Shafter&#x27;s aide, Lt. John D. Miley, then to take the remaining three guns forward &quot;to the best point you can find&quot;. Parker set up his three Gatlings approximately from the San Juan Hill blockhouse and its surrounding trenches, occupied by Spanish regulars; away was another ridge-line, also with Spanish entrenchments. Being exposed, the Detachment soon came under attack and quickly lost five men to wounds and others to severe heat stroke. Ordinarily, four to six men were required to operate each Gatling gun. Nevertheless, the crews continued to fire at the Spanish. Lt. Parker&#x27;s three rapid-fire Gatlings provided covering fire for U.S. forces assaulting both hills. Equipped with swivel mountings that enabled the gunners to rake Spanish positions, the three guns poured a continuous and demoralizing hail of bullets into the Spanish defensive lines. Witnessing the assault on San Juan Hill, more than one observer from the U.S. side noticed some of the Spanish defenders fleeing their trenches to escape the intense fire. The Gatlings continued to fire until Lt. Parker observed Lt. Ferguson of the 13th Infantry waving a white handkerchief as a signal for the battery to cease firing to avoid causing friendly casualties. The American assault then broke into a charge about from the crest of the hill.

Major William Auman was the first commanding officer to reach the top of the hill. Lt. Ord was among the first to reach the crest of San Juan heights. As the Spanish fled, Lt. Ord directed supporting fire into the remaining Spanish until he was mortally wounded by a shot to the throat. General Hawkins was wounded shortly after. At 13:50, Private Arthur Agnew of the 13th Infantry pulled down the Spanish flag atop the San Juan blockhouse. General Wood sent requests for General Kent to send up infantry to strengthen his vulnerable position. When General Wheeler reached the trenches, he ordered breastworks constructed. The Americans&#x27; position on San Juan was exposed to artillery fire from within Santiago, and General Shafter feared the American position on Kettle Hill was vulnerable to counter-attack by Spanish forces. A Spanish counter-attack was launched late in the afternoon, but was easily beaten back with the aid of supporting Gatling fire from San Juan Hill. Though General Wheeler assured Shafter that the position could be held, Shafter nevertheless ordered a withdrawal. Before the men on Kettle Hill could withdraw, General Wheeler called aside Generals Kent and Sumner and reassured them that the line could be held. During the night, the Americans worked at strengthening the lines while awaiting reinforcements.

==== The Attack on Kettle Hill ====
The 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry (Rough Riders), along with the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, began a near simultaneous assault supporting the regulars of the 10th Cavalry (Buffalo Soldiers) up Kettle Hill, supported by the fire of three Gatling guns commanded by Lt. John H. Parker. Trooper Jesse D. Langdon of the 1st Volunteer Infantry, who accompanied 
Col. Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders in their assault on Kettle Hill, reported:

During the battle, Parker&#x27;s Gatling guns expended approximately 18,000 rounds in eight and a half minutes (over 700 rounds per minute of continuous fire) into the Spanish defensive lines atop the heights, killing many of the defenders and forcing others to flee the trench lines, while disrupting the aim of any still alive who continued to resist. Col. Egbert, commander of the 6th Infantry assaulting San Juan Hill, stated that his regiment was brought to a halt near the top of the hill to await the cease-fire order, as the Gatling fire striking the crest and trench line was so intense. Col. Theodore Roosevelt later gave much of the credit for the successful capture of the Spanish positions atop the heights to Parker&#x27;s inventive use of his Gatling Gun Detachment: &quot;I think Parker deserved rather more credit than any other one man in the entire campaign ... he had the rare good judgment and foresight to see the possibilities of the machine-guns. He then, by his own exertions, got it to the front and proved that it could do invaluable work on the field of battle, as much in attack as in defense.&quot; Roosevelt observed that the hammering sound of the guns raised the spirits of his men: &quot;While thus firing, there suddenly smote on our ears a peculiar drumming sound. One or two of the men cried out, &#x27;The Spanish machine guns!&#x27; but, after listening a moment, I leaped to my feet and called, &#x27;It&#x27;s the Gatlings, men! Our Gatlings!&#x27; Immediately the troopers began to cheer lustily, for the sound was most inspiring.&quot;

Under continuous fire, the advance slowed as troops dropped from heat exhaustion. Officers from the rest of Wood&#x27;s brigade, along with Carroll&#x27;s, bunched up under fire. When the regulars of the all-black Buffalo Soldiers punched toward the top of the hill, the units became intermingled. One of the 10th&#x27;s officers who took part in the attack, 1st Lieutenant John J. &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing, would later reach the highest rank ever held in the United States Army by a living officerGeneral of the Armies of the United States. Pershing later recalled that:

When the American formations (10th, 3rd, and 1st Volunteers) reached the summit of Kettle Hill, they briefly fought hand to hand within the Spanish defensive works, at which point the Spanish retreated. Most reports name the first American soldier to reach the crest of Kettle Hill as Sgt. George Berry of the 10th Cavalry, who took both the 10th and 3rd Cavalry battle flags to the summit. This is supported in the writings of Pershing, who fought with the 10th on Kettle Hill and who was present when Col. Roosevelt reached the top. Politics and racial discrimination led to many myths about the African-American involvement in the fighting in Cuba.

Second Lieutenant Thomas H. Rynning is credited with being the first Rough Rider to reach the top of the hill, where he rallied his men with the Rough Riders&#x27; flag.

General Linares&#x27;s troops on San Juan heights fired on the newly won American position on the crest of Kettle Hill. The Americans returned fire on the entrenched Spanish troops. Seeing the &quot;spontaneous advance&quot; of the 1st Infantry Brigade, led by the 10th Cavalry, General Wheeler (having returned to the front) gave the order for General Kent to advance with his whole division and ordered the 3rd Brigade into the attack. Kent sent forward the 3rd Infantry Brigade, now effectively commanded by Lt. Col. Ezra P. Ewers, to join the advance, which had successfully reached the heights.&quot;Previous to the return of the troops the newspapers in the Territory claimed the distinction for Arizona that [George] Truman of B Troop was the first American soldier on the Heights of San Juan. On return of the troops this statement was verified by Middleton, Owens and Sargent Norton of B Troop who were along with, and close to, Truman at the time the ascent was made.&quot;

=== Spanish counterattack ===

Witnessing the assault on San Juan Hill, Col. Roosevelt decided to cross the steep ravine from Kettle Hill to San Juan Hill to support the ongoing fighting. Calling for his men to follow, he ran forward, only to find just five of the Rough Riders following him (most had not heard his command). Roosevelt returned, gathered a larger group of men. Under advice he led them down the less steep western slope of Kettle Hill, past a small lagoon, and was ready to start up the northern extension of San Juan Hill. By then the fighting was over at the top of the heights. General Sumner intercepted Roosevelt and angrily ordered him to return to Kettle Hill immediately to prepare for the expected counterattack. When he returned, his men were exhausted and his horse was spent from the heat. When the expected counterattack came, these men were ineffective.

After the Spanish positions atop San Juan Hill had been taken, two of Lt. Parker&#x27;s Gatling guns were dragged by mules up the slope to the captured position on San Juan ridge, where both were hurriedly emplaced among a line of skirmishers. As the Americans were setting up the guns, the Spanish commenced a general counterattack on the heights. Though the attack on San Juan was quickly broken up, the men on Kettle Hill faced a more serious attack from some 120 Spanish regulars. Ignoring an order from Col. Leonard Wood to reposition one or two of his Gatling guns to the top of Kettle Hill to support the 1st Volunteer and 3rd Cavalry, Parker instead ordered the closest Gatling, manned by Sgt. Green, to fire obliquely against 600 enemy soldiers attacking Kettle Hill. From a range of , Sgt. Green&#x27;s Gatling responded, killing all but 40 of the attackers.

After the counterattack was driven off, Lt. Parker moved to Kettle Hill to view the American positions, where he was soon joined by Sgt. Weigle&#x27;s Gatling and crew from San Juan, detached to the service of Lt. Miley. Miley (who was primarily tasked with inspecting troop positions for General Shafter) had restrained Weigle&#x27;s crew from opening fire during the entirety of the fighting. Parker then ordered Sgt. Weigle and his crew to emplace their gun on Kettle Hill. This Gatling was used to eliminate Spanish sniper fire against the American defensive positions on Kettle Hill.

Returning to the two Gatlings on San Juan Hill, Lt. Parker had the guns relocated near the road to avoid counter-battery fire. Despite this precaution, the guns were bombarded by a heavy Spanish gun. Parker located the enemy gun and trained the two Gatlings using a powerful set of field glasses. The two Gatlings then opened fire, silencing the Spanish gun at a range of roughly . July 4, Parker ordered his three operational guns moved into the battle line around the city of Santiago. The wheels of the Gatling carriages were removed, and the Gatlings, along with two 7 mm Colt–Browning machine guns (a gift from Col. Roosevelt) were placed in breastworks where they could command various sectors of fire. The fourth Gatling was repaired and placed in reserve. However, it was soon moved to Fort Canosa, where it was used during the siege of Santiago to fire 6,000–7,000 rounds into the city to help force a surrender.

== Aftermath ==

The Americans suffered over twice as many casualties as the Spaniards. The Spaniards fought to the knife, losing a third of their force in casualties, but yielding very few prisoners. In view of the large number of U.S. casualties incurred from small-arms fire, the Army decided to update and modernize its small arms arsenal. The .45-70 and M1892 (Krag) Springfield rifles were quickly retired from service in favor of new Mauser-pattern .30-03 (later .30-06 Springfield) M1903 Springfield rifles, while the remaining .30 Army Gatling guns were replaced in 1909 by the M1909 Benét–Mercié machine gun.

Lawton&#x27;s division, which was supposed to have joined the fight early on July 1, 1898, did not arrive until noon the following day, on July 2, 1898, having encountered unexpectedly heavy resistance in the battle of El Caney. The Americans, aided by Cuban insurgents, immediately began the Siege of Santiago, which surrendered just over two weeks later, on July 17, 1898. Although Roosevelt and the Rough Riders achieved considerable fame with the victory, other soldiers fared less well. Ord never received recognition in the popular press of the day for his actions. The Army turned down requests for a medal for his heroism from his commanding officer and his commanding general.

<doc id="312877" wikidata="Q838495" url="?curid=312877" title="Jordan normal form">
<text>In linear algebra, a Jordan normal form, also known as a Jordan canonical form,
is an upper triangular matrix of a particular form called a Jordan matrix representing a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space with respect to some basis. Such a matrix has each non-zero off-diagonal entry equal to 1, immediately above the main diagonal (on the superdiagonal), and with identical diagonal entries to the left and below them.

Let &quot;V&quot; be a vector space over a field &quot;K&quot;. Then a basis with respect to which the matrix has the required form exists if and only if all eigenvalues of the matrix lie in &quot;K&quot;, or equivalently if the characteristic polynomial of the operator splits into linear factors over &quot;K&quot;. This condition is always satisfied if &quot;K&quot; is algebraically closed (for instance, if it is the field of complex numbers). The diagonal entries of the normal form are the eigenvalues (of the operator), and the number of times each eigenvalue occurs is called the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue.

If the operator is originally given by a square matrix &quot;M&quot;, then its Jordan normal form is also called the Jordan normal form of &quot;M&quot;. Any square matrix has a Jordan normal form if the field of coefficients is extended to one containing all the eigenvalues of the matrix. In spite of its name, the normal form for a given &quot;M&quot; is not entirely unique, as it is a block diagonal matrix formed of Jordan blocks, the order of which is not fixed; it is conventional to group blocks for the same eigenvalue together, but no ordering is imposed among the eigenvalues, nor among the blocks for a given eigenvalue, although the latter could for instance be ordered by weakly decreasing size.

The Jordan–Chevalley decomposition is particularly simple with respect to a basis for which the operator takes its Jordan normal form. The diagonal form for diagonalizable matrices, for instance normal matrices, is a special case of the Jordan normal form.

The Jordan normal form is named after Camille Jordan, who first stated the Jordan decomposition theorem in 1870.

== Overview ==
=== Notation ===
Some textbooks have the ones on the subdiagonal; that is, immediately below the main diagonal instead of on the superdiagonal. The eigenvalues are still on the main diagonal.

=== Motivation ===
An &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces is &quot;n&quot;. Or, equivalently, if and only if &quot;A&quot; has &quot;n&quot; linearly independent eigenvectors. Not all matrices are diagonalizable; matrices that are not diagonalizable are called defective matrices. Consider the following matrix:

: formula_1

Including multiplicity, the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; are &quot;λ&quot; = 1, 2, 4, 4. The dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 is 1 (and not 2), so &quot;A&quot; is not diagonalizable. However, there is an invertible matrix &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;J&quot; = &quot;P&quot;−1&quot;AP&quot;, where

:formula_2

The matrix formula_3 is almost diagonal. This is the Jordan normal form of &quot;A&quot;. The section &quot;Example&quot; below fills in the details of the computation.

== Complex matrices ==

In general, a square complex matrix &quot;A&quot; is similar to a block diagonal matrix

:formula_4

where each block &quot;Ji&quot; is a square matrix of the form

:formula_5

So there exists an invertible matrix &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;P&quot;−1&quot;AP&quot; = &quot;J&quot; is such that the only non-zero entries of &quot;J&quot; are on the diagonal and the superdiagonal. &quot;J&quot; is called the Jordan normal form of &quot;A&quot;. Each &quot;J&quot;&quot;i&quot; is called a Jordan block of &quot;A&quot;. In a given Jordan block, every entry on the superdiagonal is 1.

Assuming this result, we can deduce the following properties:

* Counting multiplicities, the eigenvalues of &quot;J&quot;, and therefore of &quot;A&quot;, are the diagonal entries.
* Given an eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;, its geometric multiplicity is the dimension of ker(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; &quot;I&quot;), where &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix, and it is the number of Jordan blocks corresponding to &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
* The sum of the sizes of all Jordan blocks corresponding to an eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; is its algebraic multiplicity.
* &quot;A&quot; is diagonalizable if and only if, for every eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, its geometric and algebraic multiplicities coincide. In particular, the Jordan blocks in this case are 1 × 1 matrices; that is, scalars.
* The Jordan block corresponding to &quot;λ&quot; is of the form &quot;λI&quot; + &quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is a nilpotent matrix defined as &quot;N&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = &quot;δi&quot;,&quot;j&quot;−1 (where δ is the Kronecker delta). The nilpotency of &quot;N&quot; can be exploited when calculating &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) where &quot;f&quot; is a complex analytic function. For example, in principle the Jordan form could give a closed-form expression for the exponential exp(&quot;A&quot;).
* The number of Jordan blocks corresponding to &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; of size at least &quot;j&quot; is dim ker(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;I&quot;)&quot;j&quot; − dim ker(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;I&quot;)&quot;j&quot;−1. Thus, the number of Jordan blocks of size &quot;j&quot; is
*:formula_6
* Given an eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;, its multiplicity in the minimal polynomial is the size of its largest Jordan block.

=== Example ===
Consider the matrix formula_7 from the example in the previous section. The Jordan normal form is obtained by some similarity transformation:

:formula_8 that is, formula_9

Let formula_10 have column vectors formula_11, formula_12, then

: formula_13

We see that
:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17

For formula_18 we have formula_19, that is, formula_11 is an eigenvector of formula_7 corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_22. For formula_23, multiplying both sides by formula_24 gives
:formula_25
But formula_26, so
:formula_27
Thus, formula_28

Vectors such as formula_29 are called generalized eigenvectors of &quot;A&quot;.

=== Example: Obtaining the normal form ===

This example shows how to calculate the Jordan normal form of a given matrix.

Consider the matrix
:formula_30
which is mentioned in the beginning of the article.

The characteristic polynomial of &quot;A&quot; is
:formula_31
This shows that the eigenvalues are 1, 2, 4 and 4, according to algebraic multiplicity. The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 can be found by solving the equation &quot;Av&quot; = &quot;λv&quot;. It is spanned by the column vector &quot;v&quot; = (−1, 1, 0, 0)T. Similarly, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 2 is spanned by &quot;w&quot; = (1, −1, 0, 1)T. Finally, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 is also one-dimensional (even though this is a double eigenvalue) and is spanned by &quot;x&quot; = (1, 0, −1, 1)T. So, the geometric multiplicity (that is, the dimension of the eigenspace of the given eigenvalue) of each of the three eigenvalues is one. Therefore, the two eigenvalues equal to 4 correspond to a single Jordan block, and the Jordan normal form of the matrix &quot;A&quot; is the direct sum
:formula_32
There are three Jordan chains. Two have length one: {&quot;v&quot;} and {&quot;w&quot;}, corresponding to the eigenvalues 1 and 2, respectively. There is one chain of length two corresponding to the eigenvalue 4. To find this chain, calculate
: formula_33

where &quot;I&quot; is the 4 × 4 identity matrix. Pick a vector in the above span that is not in the kernel of &quot;A&quot; − 4&quot;I&quot;; for example, &quot;y&quot; = (1,0,0,0)T. Now, (&quot;A&quot; − 4&quot;I&quot;)&quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; and (&quot;A&quot; − 4&quot;I&quot;)&quot;x&quot; = 0, so {&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;} is a chain of length two corresponding to the eigenvalue 4.

The transition matrix &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;P&quot;−1&quot;AP&quot; = &quot;J&quot; is formed by putting these vectors next to each other as follows
:formula_34
A computation shows that the equation &quot;P&quot;−1&quot;AP&quot; = &quot;J&quot; indeed holds.

:formula_35

If we had interchanged the order in which the chain vectors appeared, that is, changing the order of &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and {&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;} together, the Jordan blocks would be interchanged. However, the Jordan forms are equivalent Jordan forms.

== Generalized eigenvectors ==

Given an eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;, every corresponding Jordan block gives rise to a Jordan chain of linearly independent vectors &quot;pi, i = &quot;1&quot;, ..., b&quot;, where &quot;b&quot; is the size of the Jordan block. The generator, or lead vector, &quot;pb&quot; of the chain is a generalized eigenvector such that (&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI)&quot;b&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;b&quot; = 0. The vector &quot;p&quot;1 = (&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI)&quot;b&quot;−1&quot;p&quot;&quot;b&quot; is an ordinary eigenvector corresponding to &quot;λ&quot;. In general, &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a preimage of &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1 under &quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI. So the lead vector generates the chain via multiplication by &quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI. Therefore, the statement that every square matrix &quot;A&quot; can be put in Jordan normal form is equivalent to the claim that the underlying vector space has a basis composed of Jordan chains.

=== A proof ===
We give a proof by induction that any complex-valued square matrix &quot;A&quot; may be put in Jordan normal form. Since the underlying vector space can be shown to be the direct sum of invariant subspaces associated with the eigenvalues, &quot;A&quot; can be assumed to have just one eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;. The 1 × 1 case is trivial. Let &quot;A&quot; be an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix. The range of &quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI, denoted by Ran(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI), is an invariant subspace of &quot;A&quot;. Also, since &quot;λ&quot; is an eigenvalue of &quot;A&quot;, the dimension of Ran(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI), &quot;r&quot;, is strictly less than &quot;n&quot;, so, by the inductive hypothesis, Ran(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI) has a basis {&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;r&quot;} composed of Jordan chains.
Next consider the kernel, that is, the subspace ker(&quot;A&quot;−&quot;λ&quot;I). If

:formula_36

the desired result follows immediately from the rank–nullity theorem. (This would be the case, for example, if &quot;A&quot; were Hermitian.)

Otherwise, if

:formula_37

let the dimension of &quot;Q&quot; be &quot;s&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot;. Each vector in &quot;Q&quot; is an eigenvector, so Ran(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;I) must contain &quot;s&quot; Jordan chains corresponding to &quot;s&quot; linearly independent eigenvectors. Therefore the basis {&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;r&quot;} must contain &quot;s&quot; vectors, say {&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;ps&quot;}, that are lead vectors of these Jordan chains. We can &quot;extend the chains&quot; by taking the preimages of these lead vectors. (This is the key step.) Let &quot;q&quot;&quot;i&quot; be such that

:formula_38

Finally, we can pick any basis for

:formula_39

and then lift to vectors {&quot;z&quot;1, ..., &quot;z&quot;&quot;t&quot;} in ker(&quot;A&quot;−&quot;λI&quot;). Each &quot;z&quot;&quot;i&quot; forms a Jordan chain of length 1. We just need to show that the union of {&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;r&quot;}, {&quot;z&quot;1, ..., &quot;z&quot;&quot;t&quot;}, and {&quot;q&quot;1, ..., &quot;qs&quot;} forms a basis for the vector space. 

By the rank-nullity theorem, dim(ker(&quot;A&quot;−&quot;λI))=&quot;n-r&quot;, so &quot;t=n-r-s&quot;, and so the number of vectors in the potential basis is equal to n. To show linear independence, suppose some linear combination of the vectors is 0. Applying &quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI, we get some linear combination of &quot;p&quot;i, with the &quot;qi&quot; becoming lead vectors among the &quot;p&quot;i. From linear indepence of &quot;p&quot;i, it follows that the coefficients of the vectors &quot;qi&quot; must be zero. Furthermore, no non-trivial linear combination of the &quot;zi&quot; can equal a linear combination of &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, because then it would belong to Ran(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot; I) and thus &quot;Q,&quot; which is impossible by the construction of &quot;zi&quot;. Therefore the coefficients of the &quot;zi&quot; will also be 0. This leaves in the original linear combination just the &quot;pi&quot; terms, which are assumed to be linearly independent, and so their coefficients must be zero too. We have found a basis composed of Jordan chains, and this shows &quot;A&quot; can be put in Jordan normal form.

=== Uniqueness ===

It can be shown that the Jordan normal form of a given matrix &quot;A&quot; is unique up to the order of the Jordan blocks.

Knowing the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalues is not sufficient to determine the Jordan normal form of &quot;A&quot;. Assuming the algebraic multiplicity &quot;m&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) of an eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot; is known, the structure of the Jordan form can be ascertained by analyzing the ranks of the powers (&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λI&quot;)&quot;m&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;). To see this, suppose an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; has only one eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;. So &quot;m&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;. The smallest integer &quot;k&quot;1 such that

:formula_40

is the size of the largest Jordan block in the Jordan form of &quot;A&quot;. (This number &quot;k&quot;1 is also called the index of &quot;λ&quot;. See discussion in a following section.) The rank of

:formula_41

is the number of Jordan blocks of size &quot;k&quot;1. Similarly, the rank of

:formula_42

is twice the number of Jordan blocks of size &quot;k&quot;1 plus the number of Jordan blocks of size &quot;k&quot;1 − 1. The general case is similar.

This can be used to show the uniqueness of the Jordan form. Let &quot;J&quot;1 and &quot;J&quot;2 be two Jordan normal forms of &quot;A&quot;. Then &quot;J&quot;1 and &quot;J&quot;2 are similar and have the same spectrum, including algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues. The procedure outlined in the previous paragraph can be used to determine the structure of these matrices. Since the rank of a matrix is preserved by similarity transformation, there is a bijection between the Jordan blocks of &quot;J&quot;1 and &quot;J&quot;2. This proves the uniqueness part of the statement.

== Real matrices ==
If &quot;A&quot; is a real matrix, its Jordan form can still be non-real. Instead of representing it with complex eigenvalues and ones on the superdiagonal, as discussed above, there exists a real invertible matrix &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;P&quot;−1&quot;AP&quot; = &quot;J&quot; is a real block diagonal matrix with each block being a real Jordan block. A real Jordan block is either identical to a complex Jordan block (if the corresponding eigenvalue formula_22 is real), or is a block matrix itself, consisting of 2×2 blocks (for non-real eigenvalue formula_44 with given algebraic multiplicity) of the form

:formula_45

and describe multiplication by formula_22 in the complex plane. The superdiagonal blocks are 2×2 identity matrices and hence in this representation the matrix dimensions are larger than the complex Jordan form. The full real Jordan block is given by

:formula_47

This real Jordan form is a consequence of the complex Jordan form. For a real matrix the nonreal eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors can always be chosen to form complex conjugate pairs. Taking the real and imaginary part (linear combination of the vector and its conjugate), the matrix has this form with respect to the new basis.

== Matrices with entries in a field ==

Jordan reduction can be extended to any square matrix &quot;M&quot; whose entries lie in a field &quot;K&quot;. The result states that any &quot;M&quot; can be written as a sum &quot;D&quot; + &quot;N&quot; where &quot;D&quot; is semisimple, &quot;N&quot; is nilpotent, and &quot;DN&quot; = &quot;ND&quot;. This is called the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition. Whenever &quot;K&quot; contains the eigenvalues of &quot;M&quot;, in particular when &quot;K&quot; is algebraically closed, the normal form can be expressed explicitly as the direct sum of Jordan blocks.

Similar to the case when &quot;K&quot; is the complex numbers, knowing the dimensions of the kernels of (&quot;M&quot; − &quot;λI&quot;)&quot;k&quot; for 1 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; is the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;, allows one to determine the Jordan form of &quot;M&quot;. We may view the underlying vector space &quot;V&quot; as a &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]-module by regarding the action of &quot;x&quot; on &quot;V&quot; as application of &quot;M&quot; and extending by &quot;K&quot;-linearity. Then the polynomials (&quot;x&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;)&quot;k&quot; are the elementary divisors of &quot;M&quot;, and the Jordan normal form is concerned with representing &quot;M&quot; in terms of blocks associated to the elementary divisors.

The proof of the Jordan normal form is usually carried out as an application to the ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, of which it is a corollary.

== Consequences ==

One can see that the Jordan normal form is essentially a classification result for square matrices, and as such several important results from linear algebra can be viewed as its consequences.

=== Spectral mapping theorem ===

Using the Jordan normal form, direct calculation gives a spectral mapping theorem for the polynomial functional calculus: Let &quot;A&quot; be an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix with eigenvalues &quot;λ&quot;1, ..., &quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot;, then for any polynomial &quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) has eigenvalues &quot;p&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;1), ..., &quot;p&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot;).

=== Characteristic polynomial ===
The characteristic polynomial of is formula_48. Similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.
Therefore, formula_49,
where formula_22 is the &quot;i&quot;th root of formula_51 and formula_52 is its multiplicity, because this is clearly the characteristic polynomial of the Jordan form of &quot;A&quot;.

=== Cayley–Hamilton theorem ===

The Cayley–Hamilton theorem asserts that every matrix &quot;A&quot; satisfies its characteristic equation: if is the characteristic polynomial of , then formula_53. This can be shown via direct calculation in the Jordan form, since if formula_22 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity formula_55,
then its Jordan block formula_56 clearly satisfies formula_57.
As the diagonal blocks do not affect each other, the &quot;i&quot;th diagonal block of formula_58 is formula_59; hence formula_60.

The Jordan form can be assumed to exist over a field extending the base field of the matrix, for instance over the splitting field of ; this field extension does not change the matrix in any way.

=== Minimal polynomial ===

The minimal polynomial P of a square matrix &quot;A&quot; is the unique monic polynomial of least degree, &quot;m&quot;, such that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = 0. Alternatively, the set of polynomials that annihilate a given &quot;A&quot; form an ideal &quot;I&quot; in &quot;C&quot;[&quot;x&quot;], the principal ideal domain of polynomials with complex coefficients. The monic element that generates &quot;I&quot; is precisely &quot;P&quot;.

Let &quot;λ&quot;1, ..., &quot;λ&quot;&quot;q&quot; be the distinct eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the size of the largest Jordan block corresponding to &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;. It is clear from the Jordan normal form that the minimal polynomial of &quot;A&quot; has degree &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

While the Jordan normal form determines the minimal polynomial, the converse is not true. This leads to the notion of elementary divisors. The elementary divisors of a square matrix &quot;A&quot; are the characteristic polynomials of its Jordan blocks. The factors of the minimal polynomial &quot;m&quot; are the elementary divisors of the largest degree corresponding to distinct eigenvalues.

The degree of an elementary divisor is the size of the corresponding Jordan block, therefore the dimension of the corresponding invariant subspace. If all elementary divisors are linear, &quot;A&quot; is diagonalizable.

=== Invariant subspace decompositions ===

The Jordan form of a &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; is block diagonal, and therefore gives a decomposition of the &quot;n&quot; dimensional Euclidean space into invariant subspaces of &quot;A&quot;. Every Jordan block &quot;J&quot;&quot;i&quot; corresponds to an invariant subspace &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Symbolically, we put

:formula_61

where each &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the span of the corresponding Jordan chain, and &quot;k&quot; is the number of Jordan chains.

One can also obtain a slightly different decomposition via the Jordan form. Given an eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;, the size of its largest corresponding Jordan block &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; is called the index of &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; and denoted by &quot;v&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;). (Therefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial is the sum of all indices.) Define a subspace &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot; by

:formula_62

This gives the decomposition

:formula_63

where &quot;l&quot; is the number of distinct eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;. Intuitively, we glob together the Jordan block invariant subspaces corresponding to the same eigenvalue. In the extreme case where &quot;A&quot; is a multiple of the identity matrix we have &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot; and &quot;l&quot; = 1.

The projection onto &quot;Yi&quot; and along all the other &quot;Yj&quot; ( &quot;j&quot; ≠ &quot;i&quot; ) is called the spectral projection of &quot;A&quot; at v&quot;i&quot; and is usually denoted by &quot;P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; ; &quot;A&quot;). Spectral projections are mutually orthogonal in the sense that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; ; &quot;A&quot;) &quot;P&quot;(v&quot;j&quot; ; &quot;A&quot;) = 0 if &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot;. Also they commute with &quot;A&quot; and their sum is the identity matrix. Replacing every v&quot;i&quot; in the Jordan matrix &quot;J&quot; by one and zeroing all other entries gives &quot;P&quot;(v&quot;i&quot; ; &quot;J&quot;), moreover if &quot;U J U&quot;−1 is the similarity transformation such that &quot;A&quot; = &quot;U J U&quot;−1 then &quot;P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; ; &quot;A&quot;) = &quot;U P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; ; &quot;J&quot;) &quot;U&quot;−1. They are not confined to finite dimensions. See below for their application to compact operators, and in holomorphic functional calculus for a more general discussion.

Comparing the two decompositions, notice that, in general, &quot;l&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;. When &quot;A&quot; is normal, the subspaces &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s in the first decomposition are one-dimensional and mutually orthogonal. This is the spectral theorem for normal operators. The second decomposition generalizes more easily for general compact operators on Banach spaces.

It might be of interest here to note some properties of the index, &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;). More generally, for a complex number &quot;λ&quot;, its index can be defined as the least non-negative integer &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) such that

:formula_64

So &quot;ν&quot;(v) &gt; 0 if and only if &quot;λ&quot; is an eigenvalue of &quot;A&quot;. In the finite-dimensional case, &quot;ν&quot;(v) ≤ the algebraic multiplicity of v.

===Plane (flat) normal form===

The Jordan form is used to find a normal form of matrices up to conjugacy such that normal matrices make up an algebraic variety of a low fixed degree in the ambient matrix space.

Sets of representatives of matrix conjugacy classes for Jordan normal form or rational canonical forms in general do not constitute linear or 
affine subspaces in the ambient matrix spaces.

Vladimir Arnold posed a problem:
Find a canonical form of matrices over a field for which the set of representatives of matrix conjugacy classes is a union of affine linear subspaces (flats). In other words, map the set of matrix conjugacy classes injectively back into the initial set of matrices so that the image of this embedding—the set of all normal matrices, has the lowest possible degree—it is a union of shifted linear subspaces.

It was solved for algebraically closed fields by Peteris Daugulis. 
The construction of a uniquely defined plane normal form of a matrix starts by considering its Jordan normal form.

== Matrix functions ==

Iteration of the Jordan chain motivates various extensions to more abstract settings. For finite matrices, one gets matrix functions; this can be extended to compact operators and the holomorphic functional calculus, as described further below.

The Jordan normal form is the most convenient for computation of the matrix functions (though it may be not the best choice for computer computations). Let &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) be an analytical function of a complex argument. Applying the function on a &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; Jordan block &quot;J&quot; with eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot; results in an upper triangular matrix:

:formula_65

so that the elements of the &quot;k&quot;-th superdiagonal of the resulting matrix are formula_66. For a matrix of general Jordan normal form the above expression shall be applied to each Jordan block.

The following example shows the application to the power function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;zn&quot;:
:formula_67
where the binomial coefficients are defined as formula_68. For integer positive &quot;n&quot; it reduces to standard definition
of the coefficients. For negative &quot;n&quot; the identity formula_69 may be of use.

== Compact operators ==
A result analogous to the Jordan normal form holds for compact operators on a Banach space. One restricts to compact operators because every point &quot;x&quot; in the spectrum of a compact operator &quot;T&quot; is an eigenvalue; The only exception is when &quot;x&quot; is the limit point of the spectrum. This is not true for bounded operators in general. To give some idea of this generalization, we first reformulate the Jordan decomposition in the language of functional analysis.

=== Holomorphic functional calculus ===

Let &quot;X&quot; be a Banach space, &quot;L&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) be the bounded operators on &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) denote the spectrum of &quot;T&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). The holomorphic functional calculus is defined as follows:

Fix a bounded operator &quot;T&quot;. Consider the family Hol(&quot;T&quot;) of complex functions that is holomorphic on some open set &quot;G&quot; containing &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). Let Γ = {&quot;γi&quot;} be a finite collection of Jordan curves such that &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) lies in the &quot;inside&quot; of Γ, we define &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) by

: formula_70

The open set &quot;G&quot; could vary with &quot;f&quot; and need not be connected. The integral is defined as the limit of the Riemann sums, as in the scalar case. Although the integral makes sense for continuous &quot;f&quot;, we restrict to holomorphic functions to apply the machinery from classical function theory (for example, the Cauchy integral formula). The assumption that &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) lie in the inside of Γ ensures &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is well defined; it does not depend on the choice of Γ. The functional calculus is the mapping Φ from Hol(&quot;T&quot;) to &quot;L&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) given by

: formula_71

We will require the following properties of this functional calculus:
# Φ extends the polynomial functional calculus.
# The &quot;spectral mapping theorem&quot; holds: &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)).
# Φ is an algebra homomorphism.

=== The finite-dimensional case ===

In the finite-dimensional case, &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) = {&quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;} is a finite discrete set in the complex plane. Let &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the function that is 1 in some open neighborhood of &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; and 0 elsewhere. By property 3 of the functional calculus, the operator

:formula_72

is a projection. Moreover, let &quot;νi&quot; be the index of &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; and

:formula_73

The spectral mapping theorem tells us

:formula_74

has spectrum {0}. By property 1, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) can be directly computed in the Jordan form, and by inspection, we see that the operator &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)&quot;ei&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is the zero matrix.

By property 3, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) = &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). So &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is precisely the projection onto the subspace

:formula_75

The relation

:formula_76

implies

:formula_77

where the index &quot;i&quot; runs through the distinct eigenvalues of &quot;T&quot;. This is the invariant subspace decomposition

:formula_78

given in a previous section. Each &quot;ei&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is the projection onto the subspace spanned by the Jordan chains corresponding to &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot; and along the subspaces spanned by the Jordan chains corresponding to v&quot;j&quot; for &quot;j&quot; ≠ &quot;i&quot;. In other words, &quot;ei&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) = &quot;P&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;;&quot;T&quot;). This explicit identification of the operators &quot;ei&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) in turn gives an explicit form of holomorphic functional calculus for matrices:

:For all &quot;f&quot; ∈ Hol(&quot;T&quot;),

:formula_79

Notice that the expression of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is a finite sum because, on each neighborhood of v&quot;i&quot;, we have chosen the Taylor series expansion of &quot;f&quot; centered at v&quot;i&quot;.

=== Poles of an operator ===

Let &quot;T&quot; be a bounded operator &quot;λ&quot; be an isolated point of &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). (As stated above, when &quot;T&quot; is compact, every point in its spectrum is an isolated point, except possibly the limit point 0.)

The point &quot;λ&quot; is called a pole of operator &quot;T&quot; with order &quot;ν&quot; if the resolvent function &quot;R&quot;&quot;T&quot; defined by

:formula_80

has a pole of order &quot;ν&quot; at &quot;λ&quot;.

We will show that, in the finite-dimensional case, the order of an eigenvalue coincides with its index. The result also holds for compact operators.

Consider the annular region &quot;A&quot; centered at the eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot; with sufficiently small radius &quot;ε&quot; such that the intersection of the open disc &quot;Bε&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) and &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is {&quot;λ&quot;}. The resolvent function &quot;R&quot;&quot;T&quot; is holomorphic on &quot;A&quot;.
Extending a result from classical function theory, &quot;R&quot;&quot;T&quot; has a Laurent series representation on &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_81

where

:formula_82 and &quot;C&quot; is a small circle centered at &quot;λ&quot;.

By the previous discussion on the functional calculus,

:formula_83 where formula_84 is 1 on formula_85 and 0 elsewhere.

But we have shown that the smallest positive integer &quot;m&quot; such that

:formula_86 and formula_87

is precisely the index of &quot;λ&quot;, &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;). In other words, the function &quot;R&quot;&quot;T&quot; has a pole of order &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) at &quot;λ&quot;.

== Numerical analysis ==

If the matrix &quot;A&quot; has multiple eigenvalues, or is close to a matrix with multiple eigenvalues, then its Jordan normal form is very sensitive to perturbations. Consider for instance the matrix
:formula_88
If &quot;ε&quot; = 0, then the Jordan normal form is simply
:formula_89
However, for &quot;ε&quot; ≠ 0, the Jordan normal form is
:formula_90
This ill conditioning makes it very hard to develop a robust numerical algorithm for the Jordan normal form, as the result depends critically on whether two eigenvalues are deemed to be equal. For this reason, the Jordan normal form is usually avoided in numerical analysis; the stable Schur decomposition or pseudospectra are better alternatives.

<text>In physics, action is a scalar quantity that describes how the balance of kinetic versus potential energy of a physical system changes with trajectory. Action is significant because it is an input to the principle of stationary action, an approach to classical mechanics that is simpler for multiple objects. Action and the variational principle are used in Feynman&#x27;s formulation of quantum mechanics and in general relativity. For systems with small values of action similar to the Planck constant, quantum effects are significant.

In the simple case of a single particle moving with a constant velocity (thereby undergoing uniform linear motion), the action is the momentum of the particle times the distance it moves, added up along its path; equivalently, action is the difference between the particle&#x27;s kinetic energy and its potential energy, times the duration for which it has that amount of energy. 

More formally, action is a mathematical functional which takes the trajectory (also called path or history) of the system as its argument and has a real number as its result. Generally, the action takes different values for different paths. Action has dimensions of energy × time or momentum × length, and its SI unit is joule-second (like the Planck constant &quot;h&quot;).

== Introduction ==
Introductory physics often begins with Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, relating force and motion; action is part of a completely equivalent alternative approach with practical and educational advantages. However, the concept took many decades to supplant Newtonian approaches and remains a challenge to introduce to students.

=== Simple example ===
For a trajectory of a ball moving in the air on Earth the action is defined between two points in time, formula_1 and formula_2 as the kinetic energy (KE) minus the potential energy (PE), integrated over time. 
:formula_3
The action balances kinetic against potential energy. 
The kinetic energy of a ball of mass formula_4 is formula_5 where formula_6 is the velocity of the ball; the potential energy is formula_7 where formula_8 is the gravitational constant. Then the action between formula_1 and formula_2 is
:formula_11
The action value depends upon the trajectory taken by the ball through formula_12 and formula_13. This makes the action an input to the powerful stationary-action principle for classical and for quantum mechanics. Newton&#x27;s equations of motion for the ball can be derived from the action using the stationary-action principle, but the advantages of action-based mechanics only begin to appear in cases where Newton&#x27;s laws are difficult to apply. Replace the ball with an electron: classical mechanics fails but stationary action continues to work. The energy difference in the simple action definition, kinetic minus potential energy, is generalized and called the Lagrangian for more complex cases.

=== Planck&#x27;s quantum of action ===
The Planck constant, written as formula_14 or formula_15 when including a factor of formula_16, is called &quot;the quantum of action&quot;. Like action, this constant has unit of energy times time. It figures in all significant quantum equations, like the uncertainty principle and the de Broglie wavelength. Whenever the value of the action approaches the Planck constant, quantum effects are significant.

== History ==

Pierre Louis Maupertuis and Leonhard Euler working in the 1740s developed early versions of the action principle. Joseph Louis Lagrange clarified the mathematics when he invented the calculus of variations. William Rowan Hamilton made the next big breakthrough, formulating Hamilton&#x27;s principle in 1853. Hamilton&#x27;s principle became the cornerstone for classical work with different forms of action until Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger developed quantum action principles.

== Definitions ==
Expressed in mathematical language, using the calculus of variations, the evolution of a physical system (i.e., how the system actually progresses from one state to another) corresponds to a stationary point (usually, a minimum) of the action. 
Action has the dimensions of [energy] × [time], and its SI unit is joule-second, which is identical to the unit of angular momentum.

Several different definitions of &quot;the action&quot; are in common use in physics. The action is usually an integral over time. However, when the action pertains to fields, it may be integrated over spatial variables as well. In some cases, the action is integrated along the path followed by the physical system.

The action is typically represented as an integral over time, taken along the path of the system between the initial time and the final time of the development of the system:
formula_17
where the integrand &quot;L&quot; is called the Lagrangian. For the action integral to be well-defined, the trajectory has to be bounded in time and space.

=== Action (functional) ===
Most commonly, the term is used for a functional formula_18 which takes a function of time and (for fields) space as input and returns a scalar. In classical mechanics, the input function is the evolution q(&quot;t&quot;) of the system between two times &quot;t&quot;1 and &quot;t&quot;2, where q represents the generalized coordinates. The action formula_19 is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian &quot;L&quot; for an input evolution between the two times:
formula_20
where the endpoints of the evolution are fixed and defined as formula_21 and formula_22. According to Hamilton&#x27;s principle, the true evolution qtrue(&quot;t&quot;) is an evolution for which the action formula_19 is stationary (a minimum, maximum, or a saddle point). This principle results in the equations of motion in Lagrangian mechanics.

=== Abbreviated action (functional) ===

In addition to the action functional, there is another functional called the &quot;abbreviated action&quot;. In the abbreviated action, the input function is the &quot;path&quot; followed by the physical system without regard to its parameterization by time. For example, the path of a planetary orbit is an ellipse, and the path of a particle in a uniform gravitational field is a parabola; in both cases, the path does not depend on how fast the particle traverses the path. 

The abbreviated action formula_24 (sometime written as formula_25) is defined as the integral of the generalized momenta,
formula_26 
for a system Lagrangian formula_27 along a path in the generalized coordinates formula_28:
formula_29
where formula_30 and formula_31 are the starting and ending coordinates.
According to Maupertuis&#x27;s principle, the true path of the system is a path for which the abbreviated action is stationary.

=== Hamilton&#x27;s characteristic function ===
When the total energy &quot;E&quot; is conserved, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation can be solved with the additive separation of variables:
formula_32
where the time-independent function &quot;W&quot;(&quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2, ..., &quot;qN&quot;) is called &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s characteristic function&quot;. The physical significance of this function is understood by taking its total time derivative

formula_33

This can be integrated to give

formula_34

which is just the abbreviated action.

=== Action of a generalized coordinate ===
A variable &quot;Jk&quot; in the action-angle coordinates, called the &quot;action&quot; of the generalized coordinate &quot;qk&quot;, is defined by integrating a single generalized momentum around a closed path in phase space, corresponding to rotating or oscillating motion:

formula_35

The corresponding canonical variable conjugate to &quot;Jk&quot; is its &quot;angle&quot; &quot;wk&quot;, for reasons described more fully under action-angle coordinates. The integration is only over a single variable &quot;qk&quot; and, therefore, unlike the integrated dot product in the abbreviated action integral above. The &quot;Jk&quot; variable equals the change in &quot;Sk&quot;(&quot;qk&quot;) as &quot;qk&quot; is varied around the closed path. For several physical systems of interest, Jk is either a constant or varies very slowly; hence, the variable &quot;Jk&quot; is often used in perturbation calculations and in determining adiabatic invariants. For example, they are used in the calculation of planetary and satellite orbits.

=== Single relativistic particle ===
When relativistic effects are significant, the action of a point particle of mass &quot;m&quot; travelling a world line &quot;C&quot; parametrized by the proper time formula_36 is
formula_37

If instead, the particle is parametrized by the coordinate time &quot;t&quot; of the particle and the coordinate time ranges from &quot;t&quot;1 to &quot;t&quot;2, then the action becomes
formula_38
where the Lagrangian is
formula_39

== Action principles and related ideas ==
Physical laws are frequently expressed as differential equations, which describe how physical quantities such as position and momentum change continuously with time, space or a generalization thereof. Given the initial and boundary conditions for the situation, the &quot;solution&quot; to these empirical equations is one or more functions that describe the behavior of the system and are called &quot;equations of motion&quot;.

&quot;Action&quot; is a part of an alternative approach to finding such equations of motion. Classical mechanics postulates that the path actually followed by a physical system is that for which the &quot;action is minimized&quot;, or more generally, is stationary. In other words, the action satisfies a variational principle: the principle of stationary action (see also below). The action is defined by an integral, and the classical equations of motion of a system can be derived by minimizing the value of that integral.

The action principle provides deep insights into physics, and is an important concept in modern theoretical physics. Various action principles and related concepts are summarized below.

=== Maupertuis&#x27;s principle ===

In classical mechanics, Maupertuis&#x27;s principle (named after Pierre Louis Maupertuis) states that the path followed by a physical system is the one of least length (with a suitable interpretation of path and length). Maupertuis&#x27;s principle uses the abbreviated action between two generalized points on a path.

=== Hamilton&#x27;s principal function ===
Hamilton&#x27;s principle states that the differential equations of motion for &quot;any&quot; physical system can be re-formulated as an equivalent integral equation. Thus, there are two distinct approaches for formulating dynamical models.

Hamilton&#x27;s principle applies not only to the classical mechanics of a single particle, but also to classical fields such as the electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Hamilton&#x27;s principle has also been extended to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory—in particular the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics makes use of the concept—where a physical system explores all possible paths, with the phase of the probability amplitude for each path being determined by the action for the path; the final probability amplitude adds all paths using their complex amplitude and phase.

=== Hamilton–Jacobi equation ===

Hamilton&#x27;s principal function formula_40 is obtained from the action functional formula_18 by fixing the initial time formula_42 and the initial endpoint formula_43 while allowing the upper time limit formula_44 and the second endpoint formula_45 to vary. The Hamilton&#x27;s principal function satisfies the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, a formulation of classical mechanics. Due to a similarity with the Schrödinger equation, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation provides, arguably, the most direct link with quantum mechanics.

=== Euler–Lagrange equations ===
In Lagrangian mechanics, the requirement that the action integral be stationary under small perturbations is equivalent to a set of differential equations (called the Euler–Lagrange equations) that may be obtained using the calculus of variations.

=== Classical fields ===
The action principle can be extended to obtain the equations of motion for fields, such as the electromagnetic field or gravitational field. 
Maxwell&#x27;s equations can be derived as conditions of stationary action.

The Einstein equation utilizes the &quot;Einstein–Hilbert action&quot; as constrained by a variational principle. The trajectory (path in spacetime) of a body in a gravitational field can be found using the action principle. For a free falling body, this trajectory is a geodesic.

=== Conservation laws ===
Implications of symmetries in a physical situation can be found with the action principle, together with the Euler–Lagrange equations, which are derived from the action principle. An example is Noether&#x27;s theorem, which states that to every continuous symmetry in a physical situation there corresponds a conservation law (and conversely). This deep connection requires that the action principle be assumed.

=== Path integral formulation of quantum field theory ===
In quantum mechanics, the system does not follow a single path whose action is stationary, but the behavior of the system depends on all permitted paths and the value of their action. The action corresponding to the various paths is used to calculate the path integral, which gives the probability amplitudes of the various outcomes.

Although equivalent in classical mechanics with Newton&#x27;s laws, the action principle is better suited for generalizations and plays an important role in modern physics. Indeed, this principle is one of the great generalizations in physical science. It is best understood within quantum mechanics, particularly in Richard Feynman&#x27;s path integral formulation, where it arises out of destructive interference of quantum amplitudes.

=== Modern extensions ===

The action principle can be generalized still further. For example, the action need not be an integral, because nonlocal actions are possible. The configuration space need not even be a functional space, given certain features such as noncommutative geometry. However, a physical basis for these mathematical extensions remains to be established experimentally.

<doc id="312890" wikidata="Q2330190" url="?curid=312890" title="Subprefectures of Hokkaido">
<text>Hokkaido Prefecture had 14 branch offices called 支庁 (shichō) in Japanese, which is often translated in English as subprefectures. Normally, a subprefecture consists of a few to a dozen cities, towns, and/or villages. From April 2010, Hokkaido has nine General Subprefecture Bureaus (総合振興局, sōgō-shinkō-kyoku, literally &quot;Comprehensive Promotion Bureau&quot;) and five Subprefecture Bureaus (振興局, shinkō-kyoku, literally &quot;Promotion Bureau&quot;)).

For historical reasons, some older people in Hokkaido use the subprefecture name suffixed by &quot;-kannai&quot; in their address.

==History==
== List of subprefectures ==

==Reorganisation==
The prefectural government of Hokkaido planned to reorganise the current fourteen subprefectures into nine sub-prefectural bureaus. Five subprefectures, namely Hidaka, Hiyama, Ishikari, Nemuro, and Rumoi were subject to be cut down. The capital municipalities of these subprefectures opposed the plan, but on June 28, 2008, the prefectural council passed the ordinance of the reorganization. The change should have taken effect in April 2009.

However, it was impossible to make the reform on time. The Public Offices Election Act and the Election Law were not amended on April 1, 2009, but the amendment the Public Offices Election Act was passed in the prefectural assembly on March 31, 2009, and took effect from April 1, 2010.

<doc id="312891" wikidata="Q911748" url="?curid=312891" title="Galunggung">
<text>Mount Galunggung (Indonesian: &quot;Gunung Galunggung&quot;, formerly spelled &quot;Galoen-gong&quot;, ) is an active stratovolcano in West Java, Indonesia, around southeast of the West Java provincial capital, Bandung (or around to the northwest of the West Java town of Tasikmalaya). Mount Galunggung is part of the Sunda Arc extending through Sumatra, Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands, which has resulted from the subduction of the Australian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate.

For the first time since 1982 after eruptions finished and conditions seemed normal, on February 12, 2012, the status was upgraded to Alert based on changes in conditions.

On 28 May 2012, it was lowered from 2 back to 1 (On a scale of 1–4).

==1822 eruption==
Galunggung had its first historical eruption in 1822 that produced pyroclastic flows and lahars that killed 4,011 people.

==Hazardous eruption of 1982==

The last major eruption on Galunggung was in 1982, which had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 4 and indirectly killed 18people in traffic accidents and by starvation. This eruption also brought the dangers of volcanic ash to aviation to worldwide attention, after two Boeing 747 passenger jets flying downwind of the eruption suffered temporary engine failures and damage to exterior surfaces, both planes being forced to make emergency landings at Jakarta airport.

One plane, a British Airways aircraft carrying 248 passengers and 15 crew traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Perth, Australia, on 24 June 1982, accidentally entered the ash cloud at night, about downwind of the volcano. All four engines failed due to the buildup of volcanic ash, and the aircraft descended for 16minutes, losing of its altitude, until the crew managed to restart the engines and land in Jakarta.

Three weeks later, on 14 July, a Singapore Airlines airplane with approximately 230passengers aboard also inadvertently entered the cloud at night, and three of its four engines stopped. The crew succeeded in restarting one of the engines after descending . Both aircraft suffered serious damage to their engines and exterior surfaces.
==Historical avalanche deposits==
A hummocky deposit known as the Ten Thousand Hills of Tasikmalaya attracted the attention of early-20th-century geologists. Houses were built on the hummocks since they provided good defence against hostile people, and being above the paddy fields were free of mosquitoes and rats.

Originally, it was thought that either it had been formed by a lahar caused by the release of the waters of the crater lake, or that it was man-made, composed of rocks and boulders dumped there after being cleared from paddy fields.

However, in the light of the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 and from examination of the Mount Shasta deposits, it has become clear that the hummocks are a debris-avalanche deposit. Like these mountains, Galunggung has a horseshoe-shaped crater indicating a massive landslide, and examination of shattered lava blocks revealed them to be similar to deposits on the other two volcanoes. According to radiocarbon dating of samples taken from a lava flow, the landslide happened within the last 23,000 years.

He has also done voice acting in animated feature films.

Bratt has received four American Latino Media Arts Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

==Early life and education==
Bratt was born on December 16, 1963, in San Francisco, California the third of five children of Eldy (née Banda), a nurse and political activist, and Peter Bratt Sr., a sheet metal worker. His mother was born in Lima, Peru, and is of Quechua descent. She moved to the United States with her family at age 14. His father is American, and his paternal grandfather, George, was a Broadway actor.

An activist for Native American rights, his mother took Bratt (age 6) and her other children to participate in the 1969 Native American occupation of Alcatraz. Led by young people from San Francisco, it raised national awareness of issues facing Native Americans and attracted participants from across the country. Bratt attended Lowell High School in San Francisco, where he was a member of the Lowell Forensic Society. Bratt earned a B.F.A. at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1986, where he joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Enrolled in the M.F.A. program at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, he left before receiving his degree to star in the 1987 television film &quot;Juarez&quot;.

==Career==
===Early work===
Bratt started his professional acting career at the Utah Shakespeare Festival, where he starred in the television film &quot;Juarez&quot;. This received critical acclaim, and he landed a supporting role in the television film &quot;Police Story: Gladiator School&quot;. He had his first film role as Esteban in &quot;Lovers, Partners &amp; Spies&quot;, which did not perform well at the box office. Bratt worked extensively in television, with roles in the &quot;Knightwatch&quot; and &quot;Nasty Boys&quot; series. In 1989, he starred in the film &quot;Nasty Boys&quot;, based on the television series.

===Hollywood breakthrough and success===
After several low-budget films and television films, including &quot;One Good Cop&quot; and &quot;Shadow Hunter&quot;, in 1993, Bratt appeared in two Hollywood films.

In 1999, Bratt decided to leave &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve felt like it was time to get back home to my family,&quot; Bratt said. &quot;How do you walk away from the best job in the world and a group of people that you&#x27;ve grown to love? It&#x27;s not easy, and it was an extremely difficult decision that I had to make.&quot; On May 26, 1999, Bratt&#x27;s final episode was aired. In 2009, Bratt returned as the now-retired Curtis on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, where he was reunited with his former boss, Lt. Anita Van Buren (S.

<text>An income statement or profit and loss account (also referred to as a profit and loss statement (P&amp;L), statement of profit or loss, revenue statement, statement of financial performance, earnings statement, statement of earnings, operating statement, or statement of operations) is one of the financial statements of a company and shows the company&#x27;s revenues and expenses during a particular period.

It indicates how the revenues (also known as the &quot;“top line”&quot;) are transformed into the net income or net profit (the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for). The purpose of the income statement is to show managers and investors whether the company made money (profit) or lost money (loss) during the period being reported.

An income statement represents a period of time (as does the cash flow statement). This contrasts with the balance sheet, which represents a single moment in time.

Charitable organizations that are required to publish financial statements do not produce an income statement. Instead, they produce a similar statement that reflects funding sources compared against program expenses, administrative costs, and other operating commitments. This statement is commonly referred to as the &quot;statement of activities&quot;. Revenues and expenses are further categorized in the statement of activities by the donor restrictions on the funds received and expended.

The income statement can be prepared in one of two methods. The Single Step income statement totals revenues and subtracts expenses to find the bottom line. The Multi-Step income statement takes several steps to find the bottom line: starting with the gross profit, then calculating operating expenses. Then when deducted from the gross profit, yields income from operations.

Adding to income from operations is the difference of other revenues and other expenses. When combined with income from operations, this yields income before taxes. The final step is to deduct taxes, which finally produces the net income for the period measured.

==Usefulness and limitations of income statement==
Income statements may help investors and creditors determine the past financial performance of the enterprise, predict the future performance, and assess the capability of generating future cash flows using the report of income and expenses. It is very important for the business.

However, information of an income statement has several limitations:
* Items that might be relevant but cannot be reliably measured are not reported (&quot;e.g.&quot;, brand recognition and loyalty).
* Some numbers depend on accounting methods used (&quot;e.g.&quot;, using FIFO or LIFO accounting to measure inventory level).
* Some numbers depend on judgments and estimates (&quot;e.g.&quot;, depreciation expense depends on estimated useful life and salvage value).

Guidelines for statements of comprehensive income and income statements of business entities are formulated by the International Accounting Standards Board and numerous country-specific organizations, for example the FASB in the U.S..

Names and usage of different accounts in the income statement depend on the type of organization, industry practices and the requirements of different jurisdictions.

If applicable to the business, summary values for the following items should be included in the income statement:

===Operating section===
* Revenue - Cash inflows or other enhancements of assets (including accounts receivable) of an entity during a period from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or other activities that constitute the entity&#x27;s ongoing major operations. It is usually presented as sales minus sales discounts, returns, and allowances. Every time a business sells a product or performs a service, it obtains revenue. This often is referred to as gross revenue or sales revenue.
* Expenses - Cash outflows or other using-up of assets or incurrence of liabilities (including accounts payable) during a period from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or carrying out other activities that constitute the entity&#x27;s ongoing major operations.
** Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Cost of Sales - represents the direct costs attributable to goods produced and sold by a business (manufacturing or merchandizing). It includes &quot;material costs&quot;, &quot;direct labour&quot;, and &quot;overhead costs&quot; (as in absorption costing), and excludes operating costs (period costs) such as selling, administrative, advertising or R&amp;D, etc.
** Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SG&amp;A or SGA) - consist of the combined payroll costs. SGA is usually understood as a major portion of non-production related costs, in contrast to production costs such as direct labour.
*** Selling expenses - represent expenses needed to sell products (e.g., &quot;salaries of sales people, commissions and travel expenses, advertising, freight, shipping, depreciation of sales store buildings and equipment&quot;, etc.).
*** General and Administrative (G&amp;A) expenses - represent expenses to manage the business (&quot;salaries of officers / executives, legal and professional fees, utilities, insurance, depreciation of office building and equipment, office rents, office supplies&quot;, etc.).
** Depreciation / amortisation - the charge with respect to fixed assets / intangible assets that have been capitalised on the balance sheet for a specific (accounting) period. It is a systematic and rational allocation of cost rather than the recognition of market value decrement.
** Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) expenses - represent expenses included in research and development.

&quot;Expenses&quot; recognised in the income statement should be analysed either by nature (raw materials, transport costs, staffing costs, depreciation, employee benefit etc.) or by function (cost of sales, selling, administrative, etc.). (IAS 1.99) If an entity categorises by function, then additional information on the nature of expenses, at least, – depreciation, amortisation and employee benefits expense – must be disclosed. (IAS 1.104)
The major exclusive of costs of goods sold, are classified as operating expenses. These represent the resources expended, except for inventory purchases, in generating the revenue for the period. Expenses often are divided into two broad sub classifications selling expenses and administrative expenses.

===Non-operating section===
* Other revenues or gains - revenues and gains from other than primary business activities (e.g., &quot;rent&quot;, &quot;income from patents&quot;, goodwill). It also includes unusual gains that are either unusual or infrequent, but not both (e.g., &quot;gain from sale of securities&quot; or &quot;gain from disposal of fixed assets&quot;)
* Other expenses or losses - expenses or losses not related to primary business operations, (e.g., &quot;foreign exchange loss&quot;).
* Finance costs - costs of borrowing from various creditors (e.g., &quot;interest expenses&quot;, &quot;bank charges&quot;).
* Income tax expense - sum of the amount of tax payable to tax authorities in the current reporting period (current tax liabilities/ tax payable) and the amount of deferred tax liabilities (or assets).

===Irregular items===
They are reported separately because this way users can better predict future cash flows - irregular items most likely will not recur. These are reported net of taxes.
* Discontinued operations is the most common type of irregular items. Shifting business location(s), stopping production temporarily, or changes due to technological improvement do not qualify as discontinued operations. Discontinued operations &quot;must&quot; be shown separately.

Cumulative effect of changes in accounting policies (principles) is the difference between the book value of the affected assets (or liabilities) under the old policy (principle) and what the book value would have been if the new principle had been applied in the prior periods. For example, valuation of inventories using LIFO instead of weighted average method. The changes should be applied retrospectively and shown as adjustments to the &quot;beginning&quot; balance of affected components in Equity. All comparative financial statements should be restated. (IAS 8)

However, changes in estimates (e.g., estimated useful life of a fixed asset) only requires prospective changes. (IAS 8)

No items may be presented in the income statement as extraordinary items under IFRS regulations or (as of ASU No. 2015-01) under US GAAP. &quot;Extraordinary items&quot; are both unusual (abnormal) and infrequent, for example, unexpected natural disaster, expropriation, prohibitions under new regulations. [Note: natural disaster might not qualify depending on location (e.g., frost damage would not qualify in Canada but would in the tropics).]

Additional items may be needed to fairly present the entity&#x27;s results of operations. (IAS 1.85)

===Disclosures===
Certain items must be disclosed separately in the notes (or the statement of comprehensive income), if material, including: (IAS 1.98)

* Write-downs of inventories to net realisable value or of property, plant and equipment to recoverable amount, as well as &quot;reversals&quot; of such write-downs
* Restructurings of the activities of an entity and &quot;reversals&quot; of any provisions for the costs of restructuring
* Disposals of items of property, plant and equipment
* Disposals of investments
*Discontinued operations
* Litigation settlements
* Other reversals of provisions

===Earnings per share===
Because of its importance, earnings per share (EPS) are required to be disclosed on the face of the income statement. A company which reports any of the irregular items must also report EPS for these items either in the statement or in the notes.

formula_1

There are two forms of EPS reported:
* Basic: in this case “weighted average of shares outstanding” includes only actual stocks outstanding.
* Diluted: in this case “weighted average of shares outstanding” is calculated as if all stock options, warrants, convertible bonds, and other securities that could be transformed into shares &quot;are&quot; transformed. This increases the number of shares and so EPS decreases. Diluted EPS is considered to be a more reliable way to measure EPS.

==Sample income statement==
The following income statement is a very brief example prepared in accordance with IFRS. It does not show all possible kinds of accounts, but it shows the most usual ones. Differences between IFRS and US GAAP would affect the interpretation of the following sample income statements.


==Bottom line==
“Bottom line” is the net income that is calculated after subtracting the expenses from revenue. Since this forms the last line of the income statement, it is informally called “bottom line.” It is important to investors as it represents the profit for the year attributable to the shareholders.

After revision to IAS 1 in 2003, the Standard is now using profit or loss for the year rather than &quot;net profit or loss&quot; or &quot;net income&quot; as the descriptive term for the bottom line of the income statement.

==Requirements of IFRS==
On 6 September 2007, the International Accounting Standards Board issued a revised &quot;IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements&quot;, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.

A business entity adopting IFRS must include:
* a statement of comprehensive income or
* &quot;two&quot; separate statements comprising:
:# an income statement displaying components of profit or loss &quot;and&quot;
:# a &quot;statement of comprehensive income&quot; that &quot;begins&quot; with profit or loss (bottom line of the income statement) and displays the items of other comprehensive income for the reporting period. (IAS1.81)

All non-owner changes in equity (i.e., &quot;comprehensive income&quot;) shall be presented either in the statement of comprehensive income or in a separate income statement and a statement of comprehensive income. Components of comprehensive income may not be presented in the statement of changes in equity.

&quot;Comprehensive income&quot; for a period includes profit or loss (net income) for that period and other comprehensive income recognised in that period.

All items of income and expense recognised in a period must be included in profit or loss unless a Standard or an Interpretation requires otherwise. (IAS 1.88) Some IFRSs require or permit that some components to be excluded from profit or loss and instead to be included in other comprehensive income. (IAS 1.89)

===Items and disclosures===
The statement of comprehensive income should include: (IAS 1.82)
# Revenue
# Finance costs (including interest expenses)
# Share of the profit or loss of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method
# Tax expense
# A &quot;single&quot; amount comprising the total of (1) the &quot;post-tax&quot; profit or loss of &quot;discontinued operations&quot; and (2) the &quot;post-tax&quot; gain or loss recognised on the disposal of the assets or disposal group(s) constituting the &quot;discontinued operation&quot;
# Profit or loss
# Each component of other comprehensive income classified by nature
# Share of the other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method
# Total comprehensive income

The following items must also be disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income as allocations for the period: (IAS 1.83)
* Profit or loss for the period attributable to non-controlling interests and owners of the parent

<text>Prototheria (, ; from Ancient Greek &quot;first&quot; and &quot;wild animal&quot;) is an obsolete subclass of mammals which includes the living Monotremata and to which a variety of extinct groups, including Morganucodonta, Docodonta, Triconodonta and Multituberculata, have also been assigned. It is today no longer considered a valid grouping, but rather a paraphyletic evolutionary grade of basal mammals and mammaliaform cynodonts.

Most of the animals in this group are extinct. The egg-laying monotremes are known from fossils of the Cretaceous and Cenozoic periods; they are represented today by the platypus and four species of echidna.

The names Prototheria, Metatheria, and Eutheria (loosely meaning &quot;first beasts&quot;, &quot;changed beasts&quot;, and &quot;true beasts&quot;, respectively) refer to the three mammalian groupings of which we have living representatives. Each of the three may be defined as a total clade containing a living crown-group (respectively the Monotremata, Marsupialia and Placentalia) plus any fossil species which are more closely related to that crown-group than to any other living animals.

The threefold division of living mammals into monotremes, marsupials and placentals was already well established when Thomas Huxley proposed the names Metatheria and Eutheria to incorporate the two latter groups in 1880. Initially treated as subclasses, Metatheria and Eutheria are by convention now grouped as infraclasses of the subclass Theria, and in more recent proposals have been demoted further (to cohorts or even magnorders), as cladistic reappraisals of the relationships between living and fossil mammals have suggested that the Theria itself should be reduced in rank.

Prototheria, on the other hand, was generally recognised as a subclass until quite recently, on the basis of a hypothesis which defined the group by two supposed synapomorphies:

# formation of the side wall of the braincase from a bone called the anterior lamina, contrasting with the alisphenoid in therians; and
# a linear alignment of molar cusps, contrasting with a triangular arrangement in therians. These characters appeared to unite monotremes with a range of Mesozoic fossil orders (Morganucodonta, Docodonta, Triconodonta and Multituberculata) in a broader clade for which the name Prototheria was retained, and of which monotremes were thought to be only the last surviving branch.

The evidence which was held to support this grouping is now universally discounted. In the first place, examination of embryos has revealed that the development of the braincase wall is essentially identical in therians and in &#x27;prototherians&#x27;: the anterior lamina simply fuses with the alisphenoid in therians, and therefore the &#x27;prototherian&#x27; condition of the braincase wall is primitive for all mammals while the therian condition can be derived from it. Additionally, the linear alignment of molar cusps is also primitive for all mammals. Therefore, neither of these states can supply a uniquely shared derived character which would support a &#x27;prototherian&#x27; grouping of orders in contradistinction to Theria.

In a further reappraisal, the molars of embryonic and fossil monotremes (living monotreme adults are toothless) appear to demonstrate an ancestral pattern of cusps which is similar to the triangular arrangement observed in therians. Some peculiarities of this dentition support an alternative grouping of monotremes with certain recently discovered fossil forms into a proposed new clade known as the Australosphenida, and also suggest that the triangular array of cusps may have evolved independently in australosphenidans and therians.

The Australosphenida hypothesis remains controversial, and some taxonomists (e.g. McKenna &amp; Bell 1997) prefer to maintain the name Prototheria as a fitting contrast to the other group of living mammals, the Theria. In theory, the Prototheria is taxonomically redundant, since Monotremata is currently the only order which can still be confidently included, but its retention might be justified if new fossil evidence, or a re-examination of known fossils, enables extinct relatives of the monotremes to be identified and placed within a wider grouping.

<doc id="312897" wikidata="Q740228" url="?curid=312897" title="Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus">
<text>The senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus (&quot;senatorial decree concerning the Bacchanalia&quot;) is an Old Latin inscription dating to 186 BC. It was discovered in 1640 at Tiriolo, in Calabria, southern Italy. Published by the presiding praetor, it conveys the substance of a decree of the Roman Senate prohibiting the Bacchanalia throughout all Italy, except in certain special cases which must be approved specifically by the Senate.

When members of the elite began to participate, information was put before the Senate by Publius Aebutius and his lover and neighbour Hispala Faecenia, who was also a well-known prostitute, as told in the &quot;Ab Urbe Condita Libri&quot; of Livy. The cult was held to be a threat to the security of the state, investigators were appointed, rewards were offered to informants, legal processes were put in place and the Senate began the official suppression of the cult throughout Italy. According to the Augustan historian Livy, the chief historical source, many committed suicide to avoid indictment. The stated penalty for leadership was death. Livy stated that there were more executions than imprisonments. After the conspiracy had been quelled the Bacchanalia survived in southern Italy.

The Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus can be seen as an example of &quot;realpolitik&quot;, a display of the Roman senate&#x27;s authority to its Italian allies after the Second Punic War, and a reminder to any Roman politician, populist and would-be generalissimo that the Senate&#x27;s collective authority trumped all personal ambition. Nevertheless, the extent and ferocity of the official response to the Bacchanalia was probably unprecedented, and betrays some form of moral panic on the part of Roman authorities; Burkert finds &quot;nothing comparable in religious history before the persecutions of Christians&quot;.

The surviving copy is inscribed on a bronze tablet discovered in Calabria in Southern Italy (1640), now at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The text as copied from the inscription is as follows.

==Orthography==
The spelling of the text of the &quot;Senatus consultum&quot; differs in many predictable ways from the spelling of Classical Latin. Some of these differences are merely orthographical; others reflect archaic pronunciations or other archaisms in the forms of words.

===Geminate consonants===
In Classical Latin, geminate (or long) consonants are consistently written with a sequence of two letters: e.g., &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;ss&quot; for [kː], [lː], [sː]. These geminate consonants are not represented in the &quot;Senatus consultum&quot;:
:C for cc in HOCE (26:1) &quot;hocce&quot;
:C for cch in BACANALIBVS (2:17) &quot;Bacchānālibus&quot;, BACANAL (3:7, 4:7) &quot;Bacchānal&quot;, BACAS (7:1) &quot;Bacchās&quot;, BACANALIA (28:3) &quot;Bacchānālia&quot;. The &quot;h&quot; was probably not pronounced.
:L for ll in DVELONAI (2:1) &quot;Bellōnae&quot;, VELET (3:9 &quot;et passim&quot;) &quot;vellet&quot;, VELENT (21:2) &quot;vellent&quot;, FACILVMED (27:6) &quot;facillimē&quot;, TABELAI (29:11) &quot;tabellae&quot;
:M for mm in COMOINE[M] (11:5) &quot;commūnem&quot;
:Q for cc in OQVOLTOD (15:3) &quot;occultō&quot;
:S for ss in ADESENT (6:8, 9:4, 18:3) &quot;adessent&quot;, ADIESE (7:4) &quot;adiisse&quot;, ADIESENT (8:5) &quot;adiissent&quot;, ADIESET (17:3) &quot;adiisset&quot;, ARFVISE (21:1) &quot;adfuisse&quot;, COMVOVISE (13:8) &quot;convōvisse&quot;, CONPROMESISE (14:2) &quot;comprōmīsisse&quot;, CONSPONDISE (13:10) &quot;conspondisse&quot;, DEDISE (14:9) &quot;dedisse&quot;, ESE (4:6), ESENT (3:1, 4:1, 5:10, 24:6) &quot;essent&quot;, ESET (10:4, 10:11), ESETIS (23:6) &quot;essētis&quot;, FECISE (12:9, 15:6, 16:7, 20:1) &quot;fēcisse&quot;, FECISENT (24:10) &quot;fēcissent&quot;, HABVISE (3:8) &quot;habuisse&quot;, IOVSISENT (9:9) &quot;iussissent&quot;, NECESVS (4:5) &quot;necessus&quot;.

===Consonant clusters===
Archaic gn- is found for n- at the beginning of the verb &quot;nosco&quot;
:GNOSCIER (27:7) &quot;noscī&quot;.
The prefix &quot;ad&quot; appears as AR before V and F:
: ARVORSVM &quot;adversum&quot; (24:8), ARFVISE (21:1) &quot;adfuisse&quot;, and ARF[VERVNT] (2:3) &quot;adfuērunt&quot;.
The consonants &quot;bl&quot; appear as PL in POPLICOD &quot;publicō&quot; (15:10), recalling its origin from &quot;populus&quot;.

===Diphthongs===
AI is usually used instead of Classical &quot;ae&quot; in:
:DVELONAI (2:1) &quot;Bellōnae&quot;, HAICE (22:3) &quot;haec&quot;, AIQVOM (26:8) &quot;aequum&quot; and TABELAI DATAI (29:11-12) &quot;tabellae datae&quot;. But AE is found in AEDEM (1:15).
EI became Classical &quot;ī&quot; in:
:QVEI (2:18, 4:2, 24:7) &quot;quī&quot;, SEI (3:10, 24:4, 28:4,9) &quot;sī&quot;, VIREI (19:5, 20:6) &quot;virī&quot;, CEIVIS (7:6) &quot;cīvis&quot;, DEICERENT (4:4) &quot;dīcerent&quot;, EXDEICATIS (22:7) &quot;ēdīcātis&quot;, EXDEICENDVM (3:3) &quot;ēdīcendum&quot;, INCEIDERETIS (26:5) &quot;incīderētis&quot;, PREIVATOD &quot;prīvātō&quot; (16:1), EEIS (4:9, 5:4, 25:3) &quot;eīs&quot;, VOBEIS (29:10) &quot;vōbīs&quot;, FOIDERATEI (2:19) &quot;foederātī&quot;, OINVORSEI (19:4) &quot;ūniversī&quot;
EI at the end of a word often corresponds to Classical short &quot;i&quot; or to no vowel at all. However, in many cases such as &quot;sibī&quot;, &quot;utī&quot;, archaizing Classical forms ending in &quot;ī&quot; are also found, especially in poetry.
:IBEI (20:5, 28:11) &quot;ibi&quot;, NISEI (8:2, 16:9, 21:3) &quot;nisi&quot;, SIBEI (4:3) &quot;sibi&quot;, VBEI &quot;ubi&quot; (5:6), VTEI &quot;ut&quot; (4:10 &quot;et passim&quot;), VTEIQVE (27:1) &quot;utque&quot;.
OV normally became Classical &quot;ū&quot; in:
:CONIOVRA[SE] (13:6) &quot;coniūrāsse&quot;, NOVNDINVM (23:1) &quot;nūndinum&quot;, PLOVS (19:2, 20:7,10) &quot;plūs&quot;. Classical &quot;iubeātis&quot; and &quot;iussissent&quot; for IOVBEATIS (27:4) and IOVSISENT (9:9, 18:8) show the influence of the participle &quot;iussus&quot;, with regular short &quot;u&quot; in the stem.
OI normally became Classical &quot;ū&quot; in:
:COMOINE[M] (11:5) &quot;commūnem&quot;, OINVORSEI (19:4) &quot;ūniversī&quot;
OI exceptionally became Classical &quot;oe&quot; in:
:FOIDERATEI (2:19) &quot;foederātī&quot;

===Short vowels===
:VO occurs instead of Classical Latin &quot;ve&quot; in ARVORSVM (24:8) &quot;adversum&quot; and OINVORSEI (19:4) &quot;ūniversī&quot;.
:OL occurs instead of Classical Latin &quot;ul&quot; in COSOLERETVR (6:12) &quot;cōnsulerētur&quot;, CONSOLVERVNT (1:11) &quot;cōnsuluērunt&quot;, TABOLAM (26:3) &quot;tabulam&quot; and OQVOLTOD (15:3) &quot;occultō&quot;.
:OM occurs instead of Classical Latin &quot;um&quot; in QVOM (18:4) &quot;cum&quot; and AIQVOM (26:8) &quot;aequum.&quot;
:O occurs instead of Classical Latin &quot;u&quot; in POPLICOD &quot;publicō&quot;
:V occurs instead of Classical Latin &quot;i&quot; in FACILVMED (27:6) &quot;facillimē&quot; and CAPVTALEM &quot;capitālem&quot;. The spelling of CAPVTALEM recalls its origin from the noun &quot;caput&quot;. The ending &quot;-umus&quot; for &quot;-imus&quot; occurs frequently in archaic Classical Latin texts; the vowel represented interchangeably by &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot; may have been a central vowel distinct in sound from both. Possibly OINVORSEI (19:4) &quot;ūniversī&quot; belongs here too, if one may read it as &quot;oinu(v)orsei&quot;.

===Archaisms===
The archaic ending -ce added to some forms of the pronoun &quot;hic&quot; is reduced to -c in Classical Latin in most cases:
: HAICE (22:3) &quot;haec&quot; and HOCE (26:1) &quot;hoc&quot;
The ending -d, found on some adverbs and ablative singulars of nouns and pronouns, is lost in Classical Latin:
:Adverbs SVPRAD (21:10, 24:12, 29:3) &quot;suprā&quot;, EXSTRAD (16:3, 28:7) &quot;extrā&quot;, FACILVMED (27:6) &quot;facillimē&quot;.
:Ablatives EAD (24:9) &quot;eā&quot;, SED (13:5, 14:8) &quot;sē&quot;, COVENTIONID (22:6) &quot;cōntiōne&quot;, MAGISTRATVD &quot;magistrātū&quot; (12:3), OQVOLTOD (15:3) &quot;occultō&quot;, POPLICOD &quot;publicō&quot; (15:10), PREIVATOD &quot;prīvātō&quot; (16:1), SENTENTIAD (8:9, 17:7, 21:8) &quot;sententiā&quot;.
The last two words AGRO TEVRANO (30:7-8) omit the final -d, despite containing the same ablative ending elsewhere written -OD; this fact suggests that at the time of writing, the final -d was no longer pronounced in ordinary speech.

In Classical Latin the prefixes &quot;ex-&quot; and &quot;dis-&quot; become &quot;ē-&quot; and &quot;dī-&quot; before voiced consonants. In the &quot;Senatus consultum&quot;, they are still written EX and DIS:
:EXDEICENDVM (3:3) &quot;ēdīcendum&quot;, EXDEICATIS &quot;ēdīcātis&quot; (22:7), and DISMOTA (30:4) &quot;dīmōta&quot;.

===Archaic morpheme variants===
The archaic passive infinitive ending -ier (instead of Classical &quot;-ī&quot;) is used
:FIGIER (27:3) &quot;fīgī&quot;, GNOSCIER (27:7) &quot;noscī&quot;.
The archaic third-declension genitive singular ending -us (instead of Classical &quot;-is&quot;) is used in NOMINVS (7.9) (instead of &quot;nōminis&quot;). The ending &quot;-us&quot; comes from the Indo-European genitive singular ending *-os, the o-grade variant of the genitive singular suffix for consonant-stem nouns (while Classical -is comes from the e-grade variant *-es of the same suffix).

==Translation into English==
The inscription was translated by Nina E. Weston as follows.

:&quot;The Consuls Quintus Marcius, the son of Lucius, and Spurius Postumius, the son of Lucius, consulted the senate on the Nones of October (7th), at the temple of the Bellona. Marcus Claudius, son of Marcus, Lucius Valerius, son of Publius, and Quintus Minucius, son of Gaius, were the committee for drawing up the report. Regarding the Bacchanalia, it was resolved to give the following directions to those who are in alliance with us: No one of them is to possess a place where the festivals of Bacchus are celebrated; if there are any who claim that it is necessary for them to have such a place, they are to come to Rome to the praetor urbanus, and the senate is to decide on those matters, when their claims have been heard, provided that not less than 100 senators are present when the affair is discussed. No man is to be a Bacchantian, neither a Roman citizen, nor one of the Latin name, nor any of our allies unless they come to the praetor urbanus, and he in accordance with the opinion of the senate expressed when not less than 100 senators are present at the discussion, shall have given leave. Carried. No man is to be a priest; no one, either man or woman, is to be an officer (to manage the temporal affairs of the organization); nor is anyone of them to have charge of a common treasury; no one shall appoint either man or woman to be master or to act as master; henceforth they shall not form conspiracies among themselves, stir up any disorder, make mutual promises or agreements, or interchange pledges; no one shall observe the sacred rites either in public or private or outside the city, unless he comes to the praetor urbanus, and he, in accordance with the opinion of the senate, expressed when no less than 100 senators are present at the discussion, shall have given leave. Carried. No one in a company of more than five persons altogether, men and women, shall observe the sacred rites, nor in that company shall there be present more than two men or three women, unless in accordance with the opinion of the praetor urbanus and the senate as written above. See that you declare it in the assembly (contio) for not less than three market days; that you may know the opinion of the senate this was their judgment: if there are any who have acted contrary to what was written above, they have decided that a proceeding for a capital offense should be instituted against them; the senate has justly decreed that you should inscribe this on a brazen tablet, and that you should order it to be placed where it can be easiest read; see to it that the revelries of Bacchus, if there be any, except in case there be concerned in the matter something sacred, as was written above, be disbanded within ten days after this letter shall be delivered to you. In the Teuranian field.&quot;

<doc id="312898" wikidata="Q464148" url="?curid=312898" title="American exceptionalism">
<text>American exceptionalism is the belief that the United States is either distinctive, unique, or exemplary compared to other nations. Proponents argue that the values, political system, and historical development of the U.S. are unique in human history, often with the implication that it is both destined and entitled to play a distinct and positive role on the world stage.

It originates in the observations and writings of French political scientist and historian Alexis de Tocqueville, most notably in his comparison of the United States with Great Britain and his native France. Tocqueville was the first writer to describe the country as &quot;exceptional&quot; following his travels there in 1831. The earliest documented use of the specific term &quot;American exceptionalism&quot; is by American communists in intra-communist disputes in the late 1920s.

Seymour Martin Lipset, a widely cited political scientist and sociologist, argues that the United States is exceptional in that it started from a revolutionary event. He therefore traces the origins of American exceptionalism to the American Revolution, from which the U.S. emerged as &quot;the first new nation&quot; with a distinct ideology, and having a unique mission to transform the world. This ideology, which Lipset called &quot;Americanism&quot;, but is often also referred to as &quot;American exceptionalism&quot;, is based on liberty, individualism, republicanism, democracy, meritocracy, and laissez-faire economics; these principles are sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;American exceptionalism&quot;.

As a term in political science, American exceptionalism refers to the United States&#x27; status as a global outlier both in good and bad ways. Critics of the concept claim that the idea of American exceptionalism suggests that the US is better than other countries, has a superior culture, or has a unique mission to transform the planet and its inhabitants.

American exceptionalism is a prominent feature of Mormonism. Mormons believe that North and South America is the &quot;promised land&quot; that was settled by Lehi and his fellow Israelites.

== Terminology ==
The concept of the United States as an exceptional society has a long history, sometimes traced back to French writer Alexis de Tocqueville or to the ideas espoused by the Founding Fathers of the United States during the American Revolution. For example, in August 1861 &quot;The Times&quot; of London alluded to &quot;the &#x27;exceptionalism&#x27;, if one may use the word, on which the Americans rather pride themselves&quot; in a discussion of the American Civil War.

However, the specific term &quot;American exceptionalism&quot; appears to have originated with American communists in the late 1920s. The earliest documented usage cited by the Oxford English Dictionary is from the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, 29 January 1929: &quot;This American &#x27;exceptionalism&#x27; applies to the whole tactical line of the Communist International as applied to America.&quot; In turn, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin (who was likely aware of this earlier use) condemned the &quot;heresy of American exceptionalism&quot; in a tense discussion with Jay Lovestone of the Communist Party USA, after Lovestone echoed the arguments of other American communists that the U.S. is independent of the Marxist laws of history &quot;thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions.&quot; The term later moved into general use by intellectuals.

The term &quot;American exceptionalism&quot; was rarely used after the 1930s until U.S. newspapers popularized it in the 1980s to describe America&#x27;s cultural and political uniqueness.

In 1989, the Scottish political scientist Richard Rose noted that most American historians endorse exceptionalism, and he suggested their reasoning to be as follows:
America marches to a different drummer. Its uniqueness is explained by any or all of a variety of reasons: history, size, geography, political institutions, and culture. Explanations of the growth of government in Europe are not expected to fit American experience, and vice versa.

However, postnationalist scholars reject American exceptionalism and argue the U.S. did not break from European history and accordingly has retained class-based and race-based differences as well as imperialism and willingness to wage war.

In recent years, scholars from numerous disciplines, as well as politicians and commentators in the traditional media, have debated the meaning and usefulness of the concept. Roberts and DiCuirci ask:

Some historians support the concept of American exceptionalism but avoid the terminology to avoid getting entangled in rhetorical debates. Bernard Bailyn, a leading colonial specialist at Harvard, was a believer in the distinctiveness of American civilization. Although he rarely, if ever, used the phrase &quot;American exceptionalism,&quot; he insisted upon the &quot;distinctive characteristics of British North American life.&quot; He argued that the process of social and cultural transmission result in peculiarly-American patterns of education in the broadest sense of the word, and he believed in the unique character of the American Revolution.

The term became an issue of contention between the presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign, with McCain criticizing Obama for allegedly disbelieving the concept.

== History of concept ==
=== Alexis de Tocqueville and others (1835) ===
The first reference to the concept by name, and possibly its origin, was by the French writer Alexis de Tocqueville in his 1835/1840 work &quot;Democracy in America&quot;:
Historian Michael Kammen says that many foreign writers commented on American exceptionalism including Karl Marx, Francis Lieber, Hermann Eduard von Holst, James Bryce, H. G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton, and Hilaire Belloc and that they did so in complimentary terms. The theme became common, especially in textbooks. From the 1840s to the late 19th century, the McGuffey Readers sold 120 million copies and were studied by most American students. Skrabec (2009) argues the &quot;Readers&quot; &quot;hailed American exceptionalism, manifest destiny, and America as God&#x27;s country... Furthermore, McGuffey saw America as having a future mission to bring liberty and democracy to the world.&quot;

=== Communist debate (1927) ===
In June 1927 Jay Lovestone, a leader of the Communist Party USA and who would soon be named as general secretary, described America&#x27;s economic and social uniqueness. He noted the increasing strength of American capitalism and the country&#x27;s &quot;tremendous reserve power&quot; and said that they both prevented a communist revolution. In mid-1929, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, disbelieving that America was so resistant to revolution, denounced Lovestone&#x27;s ideas as &quot;the heresy of American exceptionalism&quot;, which was likely a reference to an article published in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; earlier that year.

The Great Depression in the United States appeared to underscore Stalin&#x27;s argument that American capitalism falls under the general laws of Marxism. In June 1930, during the national convention of the Communist Party USA in New York, it was declared: &quot;The storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism and the whole system of opportunistic theories and illusions that had been built upon American capitalist &#x27;prosperity&#x27;&quot;.

=== America in The LDS Church ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (most commonly known as Mormons or the LDS Church) believes that the Americas, including the United States, are a unique place, populated by a chosen people and the Native Americans are, at least in part, composed of Lamanites and Mormons for a singular destiny, linking the United States to the Biblical promised land in the Book of Mormon, with the Constitution of the United States being divinely inspired. Joseph Smith argued that the millennial New Jerusalem was to be built in America (10th Article of Faith) and reported God as saying &quot;it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another. And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood&quot; (D&amp;C 101:79–80).

Although officially shunned by the LDS Church, fundamentalist Mormons believe in the White Horse Prophecy, which argues that Mormons will be the ones called upon to preserve the Constitution as it hangs &quot;by a thread&quot;.

=== Uniqueness ===
In general, Americans have had the consideration of national &quot;uniqueness.&quot; The historian Dorothy Ross points to three different currents regarding unique characteristics.
# Some Protestants believed American progress would facilitate the return of Jesus Christ and the Christian Millennium.
# Some 19th century historians linked American liberty to the development of liberty in Anglo-Saxon England.
# Other American writers looked to the &quot;millennial newness&quot; of America. Henry Nash Smith stressed the theme of &quot;virgin land&quot; in the American frontier that promised an escape from the decay that had befallen earlier republics.

=== Obama administration and later ===

In April 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama responded to a journalist&#x27;s question in Strasbourg with this statement: &quot;I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.&quot; Obama further noted, &quot;I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships because we can&#x27;t solve these problems alone.&quot;

Mitt Romney attacked Obama&#x27;s statement and argued it showed Obama did not believe in American exceptionalism. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said that Obama&#x27;s &quot;worldview is dramatically different from any president, Republican or Democrat, we&#x27;ve had... He grew up more as a globalist than an American. To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation.&quot;

In a speech on the Syria crisis on September 10, 2013, Obama said that &quot;however, when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our kids safer over the long run, I believe we should act... That is what makes America different. That is what makes us exceptional.&quot;

In a direct response the next day, Russian President Vladimir Putin published an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, articulating, &quot;It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation... We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord&#x27;s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.&quot;

Putin&#x27;s views were soon endorsed by future President Donald Trump, who declared the op-ed &quot;a masterpiece.&quot; &quot;You think of the term as being beautiful, but all of sudden you say, what if you&#x27;re in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 countries? You are not going to like that term,&quot; Trump said. &quot;It is very insulting, and Putin put it to him about that.&quot;

Some left-wing American commentators agree with Trump&#x27;s stance; one example is Sherle Schwenninger, a co-founder of the New America Foundation, who in a 2016 &quot;Nation&quot; magazine symposium remarked, &quot;Trump would redefine American exceptionalism by bringing an end to the neoliberal/neoconservative globalist project that Hillary Clinton and many Republicans support.&quot; However, Trump has also advocated an &quot;America First&quot; policy, emphasizing American nationalism and unilateralism, though with a greater emphasis on non-interventionism. And in his , Trump stated that &quot;America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.”

American exceptionalism has been a plank of the Republican party platform since 2012. The platform adopted in 2016 defines it as &quot;the notion that our ideas and principles as a nation give us a unique place of moral leadership&quot; and affirms that the U.S. therefore must &quot;retake its natural position as leader of the free world.&quot;

The term was adopted by former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney in his 2015 book &quot;&quot;.

== Causes in historical context ==
Scholars have explored possible justifications for the notion of American exceptionalism.

=== Absence of feudalism ===
Many scholars use a model of American exceptionalism developed by Harvard political scientist Louis Hartz. In &quot;The Liberal Tradition in America&quot; (1955), Hartz argued that the American political tradition lacks the left-wing/socialist and right-wing/aristocratic elements that dominated in Europe because colonial America lacked feudal traditions, such as established churches, landed estates, and a hereditary nobility. As a result, American politics developed around a tradition of &#x27;Lockean&#x27; liberalism. Although some European practices of feudal origin, such as primogeniture, were transmitted to America, Hartz argued that their abolition during the American Revolution only confirmed the U.S.&#x27; liberalism.

The &quot;liberal consensus&quot; school, typified by David Potter, Daniel Boorstin, and Richard Hofstadter followed Hartz in emphasizing that political conflicts in American history remained within the tight boundaries of this liberal tradition, especially regarding private property, individual rights, and representative government. The national government that emerged was far less centralized or nationalized than its European counterparts.

Some scholars, however, have disputed whether feudalism was absent from America. Sheldon Wolin has argued that the American Revolution was a reaction against increased centralization by the British government, while Karen Orren has claimed that aspects of feudal employment law lasted in America as late as the 1930s. James T. Kloppenberg has criticized Hartz for viewing American politics as a liberal consensus, arguing that this oversimplifies U.S. history. On the other hand, Catherine A. Holland, while accepting other criticisms of Hartz, has argued that this is a misinterpretation, and that Hartz acknowledged divisions within American politics (albeit divisions within liberalism).

=== Puritan roots and Protestant promise ===
Parts of American exceptionalism can be traced to American Puritan roots. Many Puritans with Arminian leanings embraced a middle ground between strict Calvinist predestination and a less restricting theology of Divine Providence. They believed that God had made a covenant with their people and had chosen them to provide a model for the other nations of the Earth. One Puritan leader, John Winthrop, metaphorically expressed this idea as a &quot;City upon a Hill: the Puritan community of New England should serve as a model for the rest of the world. That metaphor is often used by proponents of exceptionalism. The Puritans&#x27; moralistic values have remained a component of the national identity for centuries.

Eric Luis Uhlmann of Northwestern University argues that Puritan values were eventually taken up by all other Americans. Kevin M. Schultz underlines how they helped America to keep to its &quot;Protestant Promise&quot;, especially Catholics and Jews.

=== American Revolution and Republicanism ===
The ideas that created the American Revolution were derived from a tradition of republicanism that had been repudiated by the British mainstream. The historian Gordon S. Wood has argued, &quot;Our beliefs in liberty, equality, constitutionalism, and the well-being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary era. So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy.&quot; Wood notes that the term is &quot;presently much-maligned&quot; although it is vigorously supported by others such as Jon Butler.

Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense&quot; for the first time expressed the belief that America was not just an extension of Europe but a new land and a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that had outgrown the British mother country. Those sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the revolutionary concept of American exceptionalism and were closely tied to republicanism, the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people, not a hereditary ruling class.

Religious freedom characterized the American Revolution in unique ways when most major nations had state religions. Republicanism, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, created modern constitutional republicanism, which limits ecclesiastical powers. The historian Thomas Kidd (2010) argues, &quot;With the onset of the revolutionary crisis, a significant conceptual shift convinced Americans across the theological spectrum that God was raising America for some particular purpose.&quot; Kidd further argues that &quot;a new blend of Christian and republican ideology led religious traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican virtue.&quot;

=== Jefferson and the Empire of Liberty ===
According to Tucker and Hendrickson (1992), Jefferson believed America &quot;was the bearer of a new diplomacy, founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people, that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man, by means that escaped war and its corruptions.&quot; Jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional European emphasis on &quot;reason of state,&quot; which could justify any action, and the usual priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over those of the people.

Jefferson envisaged America becoming the world&#x27;s great &quot;Empire of Liberty,&quot; the model for democracy and republicanism. He identified his nation as a beacon to the world, as he said when he departed the presidency in 1809: &quot;Trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government, from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth, if other areas of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence.&quot;

== Basis of arguments ==
Marilyn B. Young argues that after the end of the Cold War in 1991, neoconservative intellectuals and policymakers embraced the idea of an &quot;American empire,&quot; a national mission to establish freedom and democracy in other nations, particularly poor ones. She argues that after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration reoriented foreign policy to an insistence on maintaining the supreme military and economic power of America, an attitude that harmonized with the new vision of American empire. Young says the Iraq War (2003–2011) exemplified American exceptionalism.

In 2012, the conservative historians Larry Schweikart and Dave Dougherty argued that American exceptionalism be based on four pillars: (1) common law; (2) virtue and morality located in Protestant Christianity; (3) free-market capitalism; and (4) the sanctity of private property.

In a 2015 book, &quot;Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America&quot;, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney sets out and argues the case for American exceptionalism and concludes: &quot;we are, as Lincoln said, &#x27;the last, best hope of earth.&#x27; We are not just one more nation, one more same entity on the world stage. We have been essential to the preservation and progress of freedom, and those who lead us in the years ahead must remind us, as Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Reagan did, of the unique role we play. Neither they nor we should ever forget that we are, in fact, exceptional.&quot;

=== Republican ethos and ideas about nationhood ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism argue that the United States is exceptional in that it was founded on a set of republican ideals rather than on a common heritage, ethnicity, or ruling elite. In the formulation of President Abraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address, America is a nation &quot;conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; In Lincoln&#x27;s interpretation, America is inextricably connected with freedom and equality, and the American mission is to ensure &quot;that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot; The historian T. Harry Williams argues that Lincoln believed:

American policies have been characterized since their inception by a system of federalism (between the states and the federal government) and checks and balances (among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches), which were designed to prevent any faction, region, or government organ from becoming too powerful. Some proponents of the theory of American exceptionalism argue that the system and the accompanying distrust of concentrated power prevent the United States from suffering a &quot;tyranny of the majority,&quot; preserve a free republican democracy, and allow citizens to live in a locality whose laws reflect those voters&#x27; values.

A consequence of the political system is that laws can vary widely across the country. Critics of American exceptionalism maintain that the system merely replaces the power of the federal majority over states with power by the states over local entities. On the balance, the American political system arguably allows for more local dominance but prevents more domestic dominance than a more unitary system would.

The historian Eric Foner has explored the question of birthright citizenship, the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) that makes anyone born in the United States a full citizen.
He argues that:

=== Global leadership and activism ===
Yale Law School Dean Harold Hongju Koh has identified what he says is &quot;the most important respect in which the United States has been genuinely exceptional, about international affairs, international law, and promotion of human rights: namely, in its outstanding global leadership and activism.&quot; He argues:

To this day, the United States remains the only superpower capable, and at times willing, to commit real resources and make real sacrifices to build, sustain, and drive an international system committed to international law, democracy, and the promotion of human rights. Experience teaches that when the United States leads on human rights, from Nuremberg to Kosovo, other countries follow.

Peggy Noonan, an American political pundit, wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that &quot;America is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world, it tries to be a force for good because it is exceptional.&quot;

Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney explores the concept of United States global leadership in a 2015 book on American foreign policy, &quot;&quot;, co-authored with his daughter, Liz Cheney, a former official of the U.S. Department of State.

=== Frontier spirit ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism often claim that many features of the &quot;American spirit&quot; were shaped by the frontier experience. In line with historian Frederick Jackson Turner&#x27;s influential Frontier Thesis, they argue that the American frontier allowed individualism to flourish as pioneers adopted democracy and social equality, and shed centuries-old European institutions such as royalty, standing armies, established churches, and a landed aristocracy that owned most of the land.

However, the frontier experience was not entirely unique to the United States. Other nations also had frontiers, but were not shaped by them nearly as much as America was by its frontier, usually because they were under the control of a strong national government. South Africa, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and Australia all had long frontiers, but they did not have &quot;free land&quot; and local control. The political and cultural environments were much different since these other frontiers neither involved widespread ownership of free land nor allowed the settlers to control the local and provincial governments, as was the case in America. Consequently, their frontiers did not shape their national psyches. Each of these nations had entirely different frontier experiences. For example, the Dutch Boers in South Africa were defeated in war by Britain. In Australia, &quot;mateship&quot; and working together were valued more than individualism was in the United States.

=== Mobility and welfare ===

For most of its history, especially from the mid-19th to the early-20th centuries, the United States has been known as the &quot;land of opportunity&quot; and in that sense prided and promoted itself on providing individuals with the opportunity to escape from the contexts of their class and family background. Examples of that social mobility include:
* Occupational: children could easily choose careers that were not based upon their parents&#x27; choices.
* Physical: geographical location was not seen as static, and citizens often relocated freely over long distances without a barrier.
* Status: as in most countries, family standing and riches were often a means to remain in a higher social circle. America was notably unusual because of an accepted wisdom that anyone, from poor immigrants upwards, who worked hard could aspire to similar standing, regardless of circumstances of birth. That aspiration is commonly called living the American dream. Birth details were not taken as a social barrier to the upper echelons or high political status in American culture. That stood in contrast to other countries in which many larger offices were socially determined and usually difficult to enter unless one was born into the suitable social group.

However, social mobility in the U.S. is lower than in some European Union countries if it is defined by income movements. American men born into the lowest income quintile are much more likely to stay there than similar people in the Nordic countries or the United Kingdom. Many economists, such as Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, however, state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity; rather, it is a reflection of income disparity: &quot;Moving up and down a short ladder is a lot easier than moving up and down a tall one.&quot; Recent evidence using more complete non-anonymous datasets shows the U.S. to be among the highest of developed nations in intragenerational income mobility, the change in social position that occurs within someone’s life. Similar findings have been made occupational mobility in which overtime un the U.S. there has been an increase in within lifetime occupational mobility for both men and women across the majority of occupations.
Regarding public welfare, Richard Rose asked in 1989 whether the evidence shows whether the U.S. &quot;is becoming more like other mixed-economy welfare states, or increasingly exceptional.&quot; He concluded, &quot;By comparison with other advanced industrial nations America is today exceptional in total public expenditure, in major program priorities, and in the value of public benefits.&quot;

===African American Exceptionalism===
A corollary of American Exceptionalism holds that African Americans are exceptional within the African diaspora and the entire world. The intrinsic injustice, moral wrong, and oppression of U.S. slavery would seem to exclude African Americans from the concept of American Exceptionalism. Comparisons to other slave systems in the Caribbean, South America, Arabia, and the entire Islamic world document on a statistical basis that the U.S. slave population increased in size, and is the only slave population in history shown to have increased in numbers. Only 3.63% of Africans brought across the Atlantic Ocean as slaves were brought to what is now the United States.

After abolition of the U.S. Atlantic slave trade on Jan. 1, 1808, the first date allowed by the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s 20-year allowance, by all accounts the treatment of U.S. slaves improved according to the law of supply and demand. Most other slave systems, including those based primarily on sugar, were in the unhealthier tropics, which encouraged continual importation of slaves from Africa and unbalanced sex ratios. The U.S. slave population lived in a temperate climate, on lands with the best soil, and U.S. slaveowners encouraged large slave families. By 1860, about half of the slave population in the New World lived in the USA. Birthrates generally are considered strong indicators of well-being.

African Americans overcame numerous obstacles to their advancement and continue to struggle against past bondage and discrimination. Those difficult obstacles were so powerful, long-standing, and pervasive that most Americans did not and do not perceive African Americans as exceptional. The First Statement of African American Exceptionalism was made by Booker T. Washington in 1901:&quot;The ten million Negroes inhabiting this country, who themselves or whose ancestors went through the school of American slavery, are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe.&quot;Washington&#x27;s observation is more true as of 2024. African Americans are the wealthiest, best educated, most accomplished, and most famous African-descended people in the world, just as Booker T. Washington observed in 1901. Scholars of the African Diaspora concede that African Americans are at the pinnacle of the worldwide African Diaspora. They are &quot;embedded in the very cultural and economic hegemony of the United States.&quot;

African Americans benefitted from the rule of law in the USA. This benefit before 1865 was indirect and extractive, but thereafter, starting with the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, the USA rose to prominence as the world&#x27;s preeminent superpower through the inclusive rule of law.

The concept of African American Exceptionalism differs from what some call &quot;Black Exceptionalism,&quot; the emphasis on exceptional Black people, such as during Black History Month.

== Criticism ==
The American historian Michael Kammen argues that criticisms of the notion were raised in the 1970s in the wake of the Vietnam War. According to Kammen, many intellectuals then decided, &quot;The American Adam had lost his innocence and given way to a helpless, tarnished Gulliver.&quot;

At about the same time, the new social history used statistical techniques on population samples that seemed to show resemblances with Europe on issues such as social mobility. By the 1980s, labor historians were emphasizing that the failure of a workers&#x27; party to emerge in the United States meant that America was not exceptionally favorable for workers. By the late 1980s, other academic critics started mocking the extreme chauvinism displayed by the modern usage of exceptionalism. Finally, in the mid-1980s, colonial historians debated the uniqueness of the American experience in the context of British history. On the other hand, Wilentz argued for &quot;distinctively American forms of class conflict,&quot; and Foner said there was a &quot;distinctive character of American trade unionism.&quot;

The third idea of American exceptionalism, superiority, has been criticized with charges of moral defectiveness and the existence of double standards. In &quot;American Exceptionalism and Human Rights&quot; (2005), the Canadian commentator Michael Ignatieff treats the idea negatively and identifies three main sub-types: &quot;exemptionalism&quot; (supporting treaties as long as U.S. citizens are exempt from them); &quot;double standards&quot; (criticizing &quot;others for not heeding the findings of international human rights bodies but ignoring what the organizations say of the United States&quot;), and &quot;legal isolationism&quot; (the tendency of U.S. judges to ignore other jurisdictions).

=== Exceptionalism as &quot;exemptionalism&quot; ===
During the George W. Bush administration (2001–2009), the term was somewhat abstracted from its historical context. Proponents and opponents alike began using it to describe a phenomenon wherein certain political interests view the United States as being &quot;above&quot; or an &quot;exception&quot; to the law, specifically the law of nations. (That phenomenon is less concerned with justifying American uniqueness than with asserting its immunity to international law.)

The new use of the term has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters since its unilateralist emphasis and the actual orientation diverge somewhat from prior uses of the phrase. A certain number of those who subscribe to &quot;old-style&quot; or &quot;traditional American exceptionalism,&quot; the idea that America is a more nearly exceptional nation than are others and that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world and has a unique role to play in world history, also agree that the United States is and ought to be entirely subject to and bound by public international law. Indeed, recent research shows that &quot;there is some indication for American exceptionalism among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of unilateral attitudes.&quot;

=== Moral purity ===

Critics such as Marilyn Young and Howard Zinn have argued that American history is so morally flawed because of slavery, civil rights, and social welfare issues that it cannot be an exemplar of virtue. Zinn argues that American exceptionalism cannot be of divine origin because it was not benign, especially in dealing with Native Americans. Deborah Madsen cited Frederick Douglass, a prominent black abolitionist before and during the American Civil War (1861–1865), who argued that the idea of American exceptionalism was absurd because the inherent nature of slavery still existed at the time.

Donald E. Pease mocks American exceptionalism as a &quot;state fantasy&quot; and a &quot;myth&quot; in his 2009 book &quot;The New American Exceptionalism&quot;: &quot;Pease notes that state fantasies cannot altogether conceal the inconsistencies they mask, showing how such events as the revelations of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison and the exposure of government incompetence after Hurricane Katrina opened fissures in the myth of exceptionalism.&quot;

The American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr argued that the automatic assumption that America acts for the right will bring about moral corruption, although Niebuhr supported America&#x27;s Cold War policies. His position, &quot;Christian realism,&quot; advocated a liberal notion of responsibility that justified interference in other nations.

Historian Jon Meacham points out examples of leaders that have made both good and bad moral choices, in some cases one person changing a position for better or worse, and in other cases rectifying bad choices made by a predecessor.

=== Double standards ===
U.S. historians like Thomas Bender &quot;try and put an end to the recent revival of American exceptionalism, a defect he esteems to be inherited from the Cold War.&quot; Gary W. Reichard and Ted Dickson argue &quot;how the development of the United States has always depended on its transactions with other nations for commodities, cultural values and populations.&quot; Roger Cohen asks, &quot;How exceptional can you be when every major problem you face, from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to gas prices, requires joint action?&quot; Harold Koh distinguishes &quot;distinctive rights, different labels, the &#x27;flying buttress&#x27; mentality, and double standards. (...) [T]he fourth face—double standards—presents the most dangerous and destructive form of American exceptionalism.&quot; Godfrey Hodgson also concludes that &quot;the U.S. national myth is dangerous&quot;. Samantha Power asserts that &quot;we&#x27;re neither the shining example, nor even competent meddlers. It&#x27;s going to take a generation or so to reclaim American exceptionalism.&quot;

===Inconsistent support for democracy===

After the abolition of slavery, the federal government ignored the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause with respect to African-Americans during the Jim Crow era, and with respect to women&#x27;s suffrage until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920. Though the Guarantee Clause gives Congress the responsibility to ensure a republican form of government in the states, successful white supremacist coups in local governments were tolerated in the Election riot of 1874 and Wilmington Insurrection of 1898. (Many other coup attempts were successfully suppressed.)

The United States military, diplomats, intelligence agencies, and foreign aid have been used to protect democratic regimes in many countries, including many Allies of World War II, First World democracies during the Cold War, and Israel. In its regime change activities, it has also brought democracy to many countries, sometimes by force. These include the governments and protectorates created in areas defeated in World War I, World War II, and the 2003 Iraq War.

The United States has also supported the overthrow of democratically elected governments in pursuit of other objectives, typically economic and anti-communist. These include the 1913 Mexican coup (against the orders of the President; see United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution), the 1941 coup deposing Arnulfo Arias to secure the Panama Canal, the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état, the 1960 overthrow of Patrice Lumumba in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état. The United States reversed its previous support for a military junta and restored democracy to Haiti with Operation Uphold Democracy in 1994–95.

=== Americanist heresy ===

In 1898, Pope Leo XIII denounced what he deemed to be the heresy of Americanism in his encyclical &quot;Testem benevolentiae nostrae&quot;. He targeted American exceptionalism in the ecclesiastical domain and argued that it stood in opposition to papal denunciations of modernism. In the late 19th century, there was a tendency for U.S. Catholic clergy to view American society as inherently different from other Christian nations and to argue that the understanding of Church doctrine had to be enlarged in order to encompass the &quot;American Experience,&quot; which included greater individualism, tolerance of other religions, and separation of church and state.

=== Pre-emptive declinism ===
Herbert London defined &quot;pre-emptive declinism&quot; as a postmodern belief &quot;that the United States is not an exceptional nation and is not entitled by virtue of history to play a role on the world stage different from other nations&quot;. London ascribed that view to Paul Krugman and others. Krugman had written in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;We have always known that America&#x27;s reign as the world&#x27;s greatest nation would eventually end. However, most of us imagined that our downfall, when it came, would be something grand and tragic.&quot;

According to RealClearPolitics, declarations of America&#x27;s declining power have been common in the English-language media. In 1988, Flora Lewis said, &quot;Talk of U.S. decline is real in the sense that the U.S. can no longer pull all the levers of command or pay all the bills.&quot; According to Anthony Lewis in 1990, Europeans and Asians are already finding confirmation of their suspicion that the United States is in decline. Citing America&#x27;s dependence on foreign sources of energy and &quot;crucial weaknesses&quot; in the military, Tom Wicker concluded &quot;that maintaining superpower status is becoming more difficult—nearly impossible—for the United States.&quot; In 2004, Patrick Buchanan lamented &quot;the decline and fall of the greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen.&quot; In 2007, Matthew Parris of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; wrote that the United States is &quot;overstretched,&quot; and he romantically recalled the Kennedy presidency, when &quot;America had the best arguments&quot; and could use moral persuasion, rather than force, to have its way in the world. From his vantage point in Shanghai, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;″s Howard French worries about &quot;the declining moral influence of the United States&quot; over an emergent China.

In his book, &quot;The Post-American World&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; editor Fareed Zakaria refers to a &quot;Post-American world&quot; that he says &quot;is not about the decline of America, but rather about the rise of everyone else.&quot;

=== Similarities between the U.S. and Europe ===
In December 2009, historian Peter Baldwin published a book arguing that despite widespread attempts to contrast the &quot;American way of life&quot; and the &quot;European social model,&quot; America and Europe are actually very similar in a number of social and economic indices. Baldwin claimed that the black underclass accounts for many of the few areas in which a stark difference exists between the U.S. and Europe, such as homicide and child poverty.

The historian Felipe Fernández-Armesto argues that it be commonly thought that all people consider themselves exceptional. In most cases in which the subject has been broached, the similarities between the conflicting parties outweigh the differences. Things such as the &quot;dynamic wealth creation, the democracy, the accessibility of opportunity, the cult of civil liberty, the tradition of tolerance,&quot; and what Fernández-Armesto considers evils such as the materialistic economy, the excessive privileges of wealth, and the selective illiberality are standard features in many modern societies. However, he adds, America is made exceptional by the intensity with which those characteristics are concentrated there.

=== &quot;America First&quot; ===
Critics may identify the political slogan &quot;America First&quot; as an apparent manifestation of American exceptionalism. Such critics may, examining American exceptionalism as the most important factor shaping the greater American political identity, further claim that the attitude is a soft power in the United States that disproportionally emphasizes the priority of American interests.&quot;

== Effects ==
Critics of American exceptionalism argue that it has led to some of the expansion that is seen during the 18th and 19th centuries in the Americas. Deborah Madsen argued that the effects of American exceptionalism have changed over time, from the annexation of Native American lands then to the ideas of Manifest destiny (which encompassed the Mexican–American War and the purchases of land in the 19th century).

Critics of American exceptionalism have argued that the bipartisan political class believes that one purpose of the United States is to spread democracy to nations that are under tyrannical governments. This can be seen in the contemporary 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

<text>Excavators are heavy construction equipment primarily consisting of a boom, dipper (or stick), bucket, and cab on a rotating platform known as the &quot;house&quot;.

The modern excavator&#x27;s house sits atop an undercarriage with tracks or wheels, being an evolution of the steam shovel (which itself evolved into the power shovel when steam was replaced by diesel and electric power). All excavation-related movement and functions of a hydraulic excavator are accomplished through the use of hydraulic fluid, with hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic motors, which replaced winches, chains, and steel ropes. Another principle change was the direction of the digging action, with modern excavators pulling their buckets toward them like a dragline rather than pushing them away to fill them the way the first powered shovels did.

==Terminology==
Excavators are also called diggers, scoopers, mechanical shovels, or 360-degree excavators (sometimes abbreviated simply to &quot;360&quot;). Tracked excavators are sometimes called &quot;trackhoes&quot; by analogy to the backhoe. In the UK, wheeled excavators are sometimes known as &quot;rubber ducks&quot;.

==Usage==
Excavators are used in many ways:
* Digging of trenches, holes, foundations
* Material handling
* Brush cutting with hydraulic saw, mower, and stump removal attachments
* Forestry work
* Forestry mulching
* Demolition with hydraulic claw, cutter and breaker attachments
* Mining, especially, but not only open-pit mining
* River dredging
* Hydro excavation to access fragile underground infrastructure using high pressure water
* Driving piles, in conjunction with a pile driver
* Drilling shafts for footings and rock blasting, by use of an auger or hydraulic drill attachment
* Snow removal with snowplow and snow blower attachments
* Aircraft recycling

==Configurations==

Modern hydraulic excavators come in a wide variety of sizes. The smaller ones are called mini or compact excavators. For example, Caterpillar&#x27;s smallest mini-excavator weighs and has 13 hp; their largest model is the largest excavator available (developed and produced by the Orenstein &amp; Koppel, Germany, until the takeover 2011 by Caterpillar, named »RH400«), the CAT 6090, which weighs in excess of , has 4500 hp, and a bucket as large as 52.0 m3.

Hydraulic excavators usually couple engine power to (commonly) three hydraulic pumps rather than to mechanical drivetrains. The two main pumps supply oil at high pressure (up to 5000 psi, 345 bar) for the arms, swing motor, track motors and accessories while the third is a lower pressure (≈700 psi, 48 bar) pump for pilot control of the spool valves; this third circuit allows for reduced physical effort when operating the controls. Generally, the 3 pumps used in excavators consist of 2 variable displacement piston pumps and a gear pump. The arrangement of the pumps in the excavator unit changes with different manufacturers using different formats.

The three main sections of an excavator are the undercarriage, the house and the arm. The boom, the front part that is attached to the cab itself and holds the arm, is also used. The undercarriage includes tracks, track frame, and final drives, which have a hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks. The undercarriage, especially frequently for a mini-excavator, can also have blade similar to that of a bulldozer. The house includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks. The house attaches to the undercarriage by way of a center pin. High-pressure oil is supplied to the tracks&#x27; hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel at the axis of the pin, allowing the machine to slew 360° unhindered and thus provides the left-and-right movement. The arm provides the up-and-down and closer-and-further (or digging movement) movements. Arms typically consist of a boom, stick and bucket with three joints between them and the house.
The boom attaches to the house and provides the up-and-down movement. It can be one of several different configurations:
* Most common are mono booms; these have no movement apart from straight up and down.
* Some others have a knuckle boom which can also move left and right in line with the machine.
* Another option is a hinge at the base of the boom allowing it to hydraulically pivot up to 180° independent to the house; however, this is generally available only to compact excavators.
* Variable angle booms have additional joint in the middle of the boom to change the curvature of the boom. These are also called triple-articulated booms (TAB) or 3 piece booms.

Attached to the end of the boom is the stick (or dipper arm). The stick provides the digging movement needed to pull the bucket through the ground. The stick length is optional depending whether reach (longer stick) or break-out power (shorter stick) is required. Most common is mono stick but there are also, for example, telescopic sticks. The largest form ever of an excavator, the dragline excavator, eliminated the dipper in favor of a line and winch.

On the end of the stick is usually a bucket. A wide, large capacity (mud) bucket with a straight cutting edge is used for cleanup and levelling or where the material to be dug is soft, and teeth are not required. A general purpose (GP) bucket is generally smaller, stronger, and has hardened side cutters and teeth used to break through hard ground and rocks. Buckets have numerous shapes and sizes for various applications. There are also many other attachments that are available to be attached to the excavator for boring, ripping, crushing, cutting, lifting, etc. Attachments can be attached with pins similar to other parts of the arm or with some variety of quick coupler. Excavators in Scandinavia often feature a tiltrotator which allows attachments rotate 360 degrees and tilt +/- 45 degrees, in order to increase the flexibility and precision of the excavator.

Before the 1990s, all excavators had a long or conventional counterweight that hung off the rear of the machine to provide more digging force and lifting capacity. This became a nuisance when working in confined areas. In 1993 Yanmar launched the world&#x27;s first Zero Tail Swing excavator, which allows the counterweight to stay inside the width of the tracks as it slews, thus being safer and more user friendly when used in a confined space. This type of machine is now widely used throughout the world.

There are two main types of control configuration used in excavators to control the boom and bucket, each distributing the four primary digging functions across two x-y joysticks. This allows a skilled operator to control all four functions simultaneously. The most popular configuration in the US is the SAE controls configuration while in other parts of the world, the ISO control configuration is more common. Some manufacturers such as Takeuchi have switches that allow the operator to select which control configuration to use.

==Excavator attachments==
Hydraulic excavators now perform tasks well beyond bucket excavation. With the advent of hydraulic-powered attachments such as a breaker, a cutter, a grapple or an auger,a crusher and screening buckets the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation. Many excavators feature a quick coupler for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine&#x27;s utilization on the jobsite. Excavators are usually employed together with loaders and bulldozers. Most wheeled, compact and some medium-sized (11 to 18-tonne) excavators have a backfill (or dozer) blade. This is a horizontal bulldozer-like blade attached to the undercarriage and is used for leveling and pushing removed material back into a hole.
