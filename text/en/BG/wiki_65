<text>The W. A. C. Bennett Dam is a large hydroelectric dam on the Peace River in northern British Columbia, Canada. At high, it is one of the world&#x27;s highest earth fill dams. Construction of the dam began in 1961 and culminated in 1968. At the dam, the Finlay, the Parsnip and the Peace rivers feed into Williston Lake, also referred to as Williston Reservoir. It is the third largest artificial lake in North America (after Smallwood Reservoir and Manicouagan Reservoir) as well as the largest body of fresh water in British Columbia. Williston Lake runs 250 kilometres north–south and 150 kilometres east–west.

The construction of the dam cost $750 million, making it the largest project of its kind in the province of BC. The dam was named after Premier W. A. C. Bennett because his vision played a major role in the project initiation, development, and realization; the reservoir was named after the premier&#x27;s trusted cabinet colleague: Ray Williston. The Gordon M. Shrum Generation Station at the W. A. C. Bennett Dam has the capacity to generate more than 13,000 GWh annually, at times supplying over a third of B.C&#x27;s power demand. At the time of its construction the powerhouse was the largest of its kind worldwide; it continues to be the largest power station in B.C and it is the third largest hydroelectric development in Canada after Robert-Bourassa and Churchill Falls. 

In addition to the benefits related to the clean energy generated, the construction of the dam and the reservoir also provided economic opportunities for the province of British Columbia, for the newly founded provincially owned electric utility BC Hydro, and for the large number of workers. These workers were involved in the planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of the project. Considerable costs were involved in the government funded project, the clearing of the area for the reservoir, called the Trench, alone cost $5 million.

The building of the dam and the reservoir were not without controversy. One controversy was caused by the significant negative environmental effects the project had on the immediate environment. In the process of creating Williston Lake, 350,000 acres of former forest land was flooded. This caused the loss of plant and wildlife biodiversity as well as risking mineral and timber rights.

A second controversy related to the fact that the land had been inhabited prior to its flooding, therefore the flooding resulted in the displacement of the forty or fifty residents located in the Trench. Among them were members of the Tsay Keh Dene First Nation, then known as Ingenika. The displacement had negative social impacts on the inhabitants as the loss of the land that had previously supported them meant loss of autonomy and resulted in isolation, alienation, and &quot;social disorganization&quot;. A BC Hydro consultant admitted in 1977 that the &#x27;isolation imposed by the reservoir had severe impacts on Ingenika society and culture&quot;.

== History ==

=== W. A. C. Bennett and high modernism ===
W. A. C. Bennett was the Premier of British Columbia from 1952 to 1972. Bennett was committed to the large-scale, state-directed development of British Columbia and promoted the continued development of natural resources. Large hydroelectric projects, such as the W. A. C. Bennett Dam, were part of the resource development for which Bennett was advocating. In his opinion, harnessing nature would make British Columbia wealthy and support the emergence of an industrial economy as well as a society that was, &quot;connected, institutionally anchored, urban, wealthy, and domestic.&quot;.

Bennett&#x27;s convictions, and therefore the policies of his government, concerning hydroelectric development have been regarded as a manifestation of the ideology high modernity, also known as high modernism. Along with the benefits that high modernist development could bring, there were also consequences. High modernism, along with the administrative ordering of nature and society, authoritarian state, and a &quot;prostrate civil society which would be unable to resist high modernist plans&quot;, can be a recipe for disaster. It is debatable whether or not all of these elements were present in British Columbia at the time, but regardless, the development of the Peace River led to environmental changes that caused a minority of people to live in isolation, dependence, alienation, and illness. On the other hand, the hydroelectric projects realized by Bennett&#x27;s Two Rivers policy created a large supply of less expensive energy in British Columbia, which provided industrial growth and therefore employment.

=== Two Rivers policy ===
W. A. C. Bennett&#x27;s Two Rivers policy aimed to develop the hydroelectric potential of both the Peace and Columbia Rivers simultaneously. The policy stemmed from Bennett&#x27;s desire to wrest control of resources away from the federal government in regards to power development in the province. Bennett and the American company Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation of the United States had agreed that in return for a fifty-year water license, the Kaiser Corporation would construct a large dam on the upper Columbia River. Not only would they pay for the construction, they would also return 20% of the electricity generated to British Columbia and pay the provincial taxes as well as water license fees. Much to Bennett&#x27;s dismay, the federal government of Canada dissolved the deal by asserting its right of control over international waterways and took over negotiations with the United States. It would appear that British Columbia was not to be allowed to sell electricity to America for provincial profit.

In response, Bennett turned his attention towards developing the Peace River&#x27;s hydroelectric potential at the previously identified site of Portage Mountain by constructing a massive storage dam that would later be named the W. A. C. Bennett dam. Bennett hoped that the economic independence British Columbia would gain by developing the Peace River would provide the leverage necessary for the federal government of Canada to allow British Columbia to sell electricity that could be created by damming the Columbia River to the Americans. This &#x27;Two Rivers&#x27; policy faced opposition from people who thought that if the Columbia were developed, the electricity generated should be for Canada&#x27;s sole use as opposed to America&#x27;s.

The Two Rivers policy led to the development of the WAC Bennett Dam on the Peace River and the Keenleyside Dam and Mica Dam on the Columbia River together with Duncan Dam at the top of Kootenay Lake. In 1964 the policy was formally realized with ratification of the Columbia River Treaty by the Government of Canada and the United States of America. Because of his Two Rivers policy, Bennett was successful in pressuring the federal government of Canada to allow British Columbia to &#x27;sell electricity&#x27; to the Americans for a thirty-year period for the lump sum of US$275 million. The nationalization of BC Electric (1961), which was rolled over into the BC Power Commission to form BC Hydro, can also be seen as a part of this strategy.

=== Site selection ===
Ray Williston, the minister of land and forests for the provincial government at the time, proposed turning sections of the Peace and Columbia River basins known as the Rocky Mountain Trench into a source of power generation. The &quot;Power Trench&quot;, as it was known, would provide not only electricity, but give the ability to control water flow for flood prevention and agricultural purposes in the U.S. and Canada. In 1957 twelve locations along the Peace River were identified by the Wenner-Gren British Columbia Development Company as potential sites to build a dam. One of the sites, located 22 kilometres from Hudson&#x27;s Hope, was judged to be the best location due to its geography. Gordon Shrum, a physics professor at the University of British Columbia, was chosen to conduct a study on the cost effectiveness of developing dams on the Peace and Columbia rivers. The study led to the conclusion that it would be cheaper to build on the Peace River, but only if a public company was used due to lower interest rates available to crown corporations.

=== Construction ===

When plans for construction were given the green light on the W. A. C. Bennett Dam (known as the Portage Mountain Dam during construction), clearing the soon to be reservoir was the first step in the process. It was a massive undertaking which was completed on the shoestring budget of five million dollars by the Forest Service Branch. When the water rose, hundreds of thousands of acres of cut trees floated on the lake surface The initial stages of construction required building a coffer dam, preparing the foundations and injecting grout into the ground to create a watertight seal, building a drainage system, and excavating to create a solid base for building. Over the course of construction, of rock and dirt were taken from the nearby glacial moraine by conveyor belt to create the dam relying primarily on gravity to hold it together. Upon completion, the W. A. C. Bennett Dam became one of the biggest earth-filled dams in the world stretching 183 metres tall, 800 metres wide, by two kilometres long (). When finished, the dam incorporated one of the largest hydroelectric generating stations. Components are located as far as below ground and includes 10 generating units located deep underground in the powerhouse. The Main powerhouse structure is named the G.M. Shrum generating station. It was designed to resemble a giant transformer to reflect its function and modern design of the 1960s.

The project was widely seen as a success, especially considering its remote location far from civilization. The construction project was managed by Gordon Shrum, the appointed head of the newly created BC Hydro crown corporation. The provincial government had specifically created BC Hydro as a way of financing the project through lower interest rates available to crown corporations and to control the development of provincial energy resources. When Shrum took over the project in 1961 it was already a year behind schedule meeting the 1968 deadline to generate power. Through a &#x27;hands on&#x27;, &#x27;cost conscious&#x27; and a &#x27;design as you go&#x27; strategy, the project was officially completed in the fall of 1967 with the first generators going online in 1968. The project was completed on time and on budget; however, additional construction would continue through the 1970s with final completion in 1980 when the last generator was installed.

The construction of the W. A. C. Bennett Dam involved over twenty unions that were bound by ten-year contracts guaranteeing BC Hydro no lockouts or strike action. This contract allowed the project to be built without labour delays. The men involved on the project were international, coming from around North America, Europe, and as far as Japan. The workers onsite lived in temporary camps built around the Portage Mountain site with more workers in the summer and fewer in the winter. Much of the construction occurred inside the dam which was claustrophobic, full of exhaust fumes, and occasionally subject to cave-ins. In total, 16 men have lost their lives working on the dam.

During the construction process, the Portage Mountain lookout was one of the first buildings built so that tourists could view the progress on the dam.

===Upgrading and refurbishment===
From 2009 to 2012, units 6 to 8 were refurbished to increase the plant capacity by 90 megawatts. The last unit of them, unit 7, was put into service on November 29, 2012.

Units 1 to 5 have undergone complete refurbishment and upgrades, increasing the reliability and capacity of the first units installed at G.M. Shrum. The upgrades increase the generating capacity of each unit by as much as 17%.

== Economic investment and opportunity ==

=== Province of British Columbia ===

In the 1950s, as well as the decades before and after, the economy of British Columbia had largely been based on the extraction of natural resources and had therefore been susceptible to fluctuations in the world&#x27;s demand for the respective resources. Despite the potentially unreliable economy resulting from this susceptibility, British Columbia was considered to be one of the most sought-out Canadian provinces to live in. This was due to the fact that British Columbia had the country&#x27;s highest real per capita income which resulted in high standards of living for its residents. It was not until W. A. C. Bennett&#x27;s premiership and vision for his province though that British Columbia saw the realization of its hydroelectric energy potential. Bennett believed that any natural resource that was not used was wasted and pushed for the development of ways to harness the enormous unrealized hydroelectric energy power potential of the Peace River. Today, the W. A. C. Bennett and Peace Canyon facilities produce about 35% of British Columbia&#x27;s total electricity.

=== BC Hydro ===

The British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority Act, introduced by Premier W. A. C. Bennett in March 1962, laid out the plan in which he would pursue his Two Rivers Policy. BC Electric had refused to commit to buying the power that would be harnessed from the Peace River development as cheaper power was available elsewhere. Hence, the BC Hydro and Power Authority Act merged BC Electric with another crown corporation, the BC Power Commission, into a newly formed BC Hydro which was co-chaired by Gordon Shrum of BC Electric and Hugh Keenleyside of BC Power Commission. BC Hydro became responsible for the building of the dam, powerhouse and associated infrastructure.

=== Local community and workers ===

The building of the dam and the powerhouse and the creation of Williston Lake provided economic opportunities to the high number of workers who found employment with BC Hydro or one of the subcontractors; these workers included members of the local First Nations, non-native residents, non-residents, and immigrants. One of the subcontractors was the Forest Service Branch of the Department of Lands and Forests to whom BC Hydro paid $5 million to clear the area that would become Williston Lake—an area that was covered in timber to 80%. At the peak of project, 3,500 workers were employed. Many of them had moved to the area for the job and settled down, at least temporarily, in close proximity to the dam project. Hudson&#x27;s Hope, a frontier town, was one of the communities in which many of the non-resident workers found a home; during the project, the population of Hudson&#x27;s Hope rose from 800 to over 5,000 in 1968 and dropped to less than 1,500 by the early 1980s. In addition, about 2,000 workers lived at a camp in close proximity to the dam.

== Social impacts ==

=== Aboriginal communities ===

For a minority of people, many of whom were Aboriginal, environmental changes caused by the damming of the Peace River meant dependence, isolation, alienation, and illness. When it became clear that the environmental impacts of the dam would render land unlivable to local Aboriginal groups who were dependent on the hereditary sites, the British Columbia government offered a settlement. For $1.7 million the British Columbia government purchased fourteen thousand acres of land, including timber and mineral rights, and bought out approximately one hundred and fifty individuals and families securing the rights to the land. Of those one hundred and fifty, roughly one third were members of the Tsay Keh Dene First Nation. Outside of relocation, Aboriginal hunting and fishing grounds around the Fort Grahame and Finlay Forks areas were severely impacted by ecological change. Many species of fish as well as mountain caribou and muskrats were no longer available for Aboriginal consumption or traditional use. These changes to First Nations independence through fur trade and the relocation of many Aboriginals to new reserves caused an influx in demand for government assistance through welfare. Between 1965 and 1970, social assistance provided by the Provincial government to Aboriginal groups in the areas surrounding the Bennett Dam increased by 300 percent. The devastating impact of the dam is documented in detail in a doctoral dissertation by Daniel Sims, a Tsay Keh Dene First Nation member.

As recently as October 2008, the Kwadacha First Nation, another Aboriginal group residing in the Fort Ware area located at the north end of the Finlay Reach of Lake Williston, reached a settlement with the British Columbia government and BC Hydro over damages suffered during construction and operation of the dam and Williston Lake. The settlement included a $15 million lump-sum payment and annual payments of $1.6 million adjusted for inflation.

The effects of the project on the Tsay Keh Dene First Nation were profiled in &quot;The Scattering of Man (DƏNE YI’INJETL)&quot;, a 2021 documentary film by Luke Gleeson.

=== Local residents ===

When the government, controlled by the Social Credit Party of British Columbia, dammed the Peace River to generate hydroelectricity it had already set into motion a series of social changes in the surrounding communities. These social changes had positive effects for workers who flocked to the area to secure jobs and economic opportunities unavailable elsewhere. It also had negative effects for residents who lived in the surrounding areas prior to the dam&#x27;s construction. British Columbia Premier W. A. C. Bennett saw growing communities when he envisioned the damming of the Peace River in 1952. In 1964, his vision would be validated as a result of the &quot;instant town&quot; of Mackenzie, where thousands of individuals would find employment with BC Forest Products. The company spent $60 million on a &quot;forestry complex&quot; to process timber resulting from clearing land for the construction of the dam. For residents who had lived in the surrounding areas prior to the dams planned construction, development caused many to be pushed off homesteads for small monetary settlements. One resident who owned a thousand acres of land, much of which was used for farming, was offered only twenty-eight thousand dollars by BC Hydro to secure the property. However, for local residents of Anglo ethnicity, full-time waged work was more easily accessible due to the employment opportunities produced directly and indirectly by the damming project.

== Environmental and ecological impacts ==

=== Downstream ===

The W. A. C. Bennett Dam held tremendous economic potential, but for its surrounding environment the experience was not so positive. Since its construction a number of environmental changes have taken place. The dam has been responsible for less drastic fluctuations in the water levels of the downstream portions of the Peace River, creating modifications to both the plants and animals in the region. In addition, it has also been blamed for creating changes in the landscapes of the Athabasca Lake and Peace River, known as the Athabasca Delta. This part of the river faced significant water loss.

Downstream of the dam the flood plains of Peace-Athabasca Delta were drying up after the floods that had occurred every two or three years came to a halt and no longer revitalized the wetland biodiversity alongside the delta. For this reason, the delta experienced lower water levels, affecting both the landscape of the delta and its aquatic life. Following the completion of the Williston Lake reservoir in 1971, water coverage in the delta was reduced by 38 percent and twenty years later, the amount of wetlands had declined by 47 percent. A reduction in the amount of discharge resulted in the accumulation of toxins and sediments downstream, decreasing the quality of the water. Fish also experienced changes as a result of the low water levels: fewer channels were accessible for walleye to reach spawning grounds and for juvenile fish to reach nursery areas therefore jeopardizing their ability to reproduce. Dinosaur Lake was created directly downstream of the W. A. C. Bennett Dam when the Peace Canyon Dam was completed. The Peace Canyon Dam was built to produce hydro-electricity for a second time with the water coming from W. A. C. Bennett Dam and its huge reservoir. Today, it is a popular destination for camping in British Columbia. The Site C dam was proposed as a downstream duplicate of the Peace Canyon Dam.

=== Upstream and Williston Reservoir ===

The area upstream of the dam experienced a number of environmental changes as a result of the flooding of the land. The creation of the lake flooded a vast area of former forest land, drowning a significant amount of wildlife and creating drastic changes to the landscape. It created a reservoir that measured 250 kilometres from north to south and another 150 kilometres from east to west. Two farmers asked for compensation from BC Hydro due to higher humidity compromising their ability to grow crops. Because the water was no longer flowing, rather, it was standing still following the creation of the dam; there were cooler temperatures and an increase in fog.

Not only did changes occur in the atmosphere, they also occurred in the water. The creation of the reservoir compromised the livelihood of aquatic life, which before the dam lived peacefully in the river. Rivers and lakes support different species therefore some fish were able to thrive in the lake but others could not be supported by its different environment. Mountain whitefish, rainbow trout and Arctic grayling were primarily the species that faced decline. A number of species were known to have thrived and it is estimated that there are more fish in the basin today than before the reservoir, but possessing levels of mercury indicating they are not entirely healthy. High levels of mercury have been measured in the lake, as a result of decaying matter from the plants and trees that drowned. Mercury is released into the lake, is ingested by tiny organisms and eventually makes its way up the food chain. In 2000 British Columbia issued a Fish Consumption Advisory for bull trout and dolly varden warning people about the high content of mercury in these fish.

The creation of the reservoir resulted in the severing of a caribou migration route. This, along with other industrial development in Peace River Country, devastated the southern mountain populations of woodland caribou, drove the Burnt Pine herd to local extinction by 2013, and had put five out of six other herds at risk of local extinction by 2016. In the Klinse-Za herd, only 16 animals remained by 2014.

<text>The British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, operating as BC Hydro, is a Canadian electric utility in the province of British Columbia. It is the main electricity distributor, serving more than 4 million customers in most areas, with the exception of the City of New Westminster, where the city runs its own electrical department and portions of the West Kootenay, Okanagan, the Boundary Country and Similkameen regions, where FortisBC, a subsidiary of Fortis Inc. directly provides electric service to 213,000 customers and supplies municipally owned utilities in the same area. As a provincial Crown corporation, BC Hydro reports to the BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, and is regulated by the British Columbia Utilities Commission (BCUC). Its mandate is to generate, purchase, distribute and sell electricity.

BC Hydro operates 32 hydroelectric facilities and two natural gas-fueled thermal power plants. As of 2014, 95 per cent of the province&#x27;s electricity was produced by hydroelectric generating stations, which consist mostly of large hydroelectric dams on the Columbia and Peace rivers. BC Hydro&#x27;s various facilities generate between 43,000 and 54,000 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, depending on prevailing water levels. BC Hydro&#x27;s nameplate capacity is about 11,000 megawatts.

Electricity is delivered through a network of 18,286 kilometers of transmission lines operating from 69 kV to 500 kV, and 55,254 kilometers of distribution lines. BC Hydro has two major intertie paths, with its system being interconnected to the Alberta Electric System Operator via WECC Path 1, and to the Bonneville Power Administration via WECC Path 3.

For the 2013-2014 fiscal year, the domestic electric sales volume was 53,018 gigawatt hours, revenue was and net income was .

==History==

BC Hydro was created in 1961 when the government of British Columbia, under Premier W. A. C. Bennett, passed the &quot;BC Hydro Act&quot;. This act led to the expropriation of the BC Electric Company and its merging with the BC Power Commission, to create the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (BCHPA).

The BC Power Commission had been established with the Electric Power Act in 1945 by Premier John Hart. The mandate of the Power Commission was to amalgamate existing power and generating facilities across the province not served by BC Electric, and to extend service to the many smaller communities without power.
BC Electric Company began as the British Columbia Electric Railway (streetcar and lighting utility) in Victoria, Vancouver and New Westminster in 1897. Power was generated by coal-fired steam plants. Increasing demand in the Edwardian boom years meant BC Electric sought expansion through developing Hydro power at Buntzen Lake, and later at Stave Lake. Sensible growth and expansion of the power, streetcar and coal gas utilities meant that BC Electric was a major company in the region.

Also about this time, sawmills and factories converted to electricity, further increasing the demand for electric power. BC Electric developed more hydro stations in the province. Similarly, small towns also built and operated their own power stations. More power transmission lines were also built. Dams and hydro-electric generating stations were built on Vancouver Island on the Puntledge, Jordan, and Elk rivers in the 1920s.

By the time of the First World War, private cars and jitneys were beginning to affect streetcar traffic. New dams were planned, including the diversion from the Bridge River to Seton Lake, near Lillooet, but the economic depression of the 1930s halted this business expansion. Also with the depression came an increase in the ridership, and a decrease in the maintenance of the streetcar system. In 1947, the BC Power Commission completed the John Hart Generating Station at Campbell River. In the early 1950s the ageing streetcars and interurban trains were replaced by electric trolley buses, and diesel buses. BC Electric finally completed the Bridge River Generating Station in 1960.

In 1958, BC Electric began construction of the oil-fired (later converted to natural gas) Burrard Generating Station near Port Moody. It opened in 1961 and operated only intermittently when needed. In 2001, it represented over 9% of BC Hydro&#x27;s gross metered generation. The gas turbines at the Burrard Generating Station were decommissioned in 2016 to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and the plant continues to be used as synchronous condenser facility.

On August 1, 1961, just days after company president Dal Grauer died, the BC government passed the legislation which changed BC Electric from a private company to a crown corporation known as BC Hydro. 

The new corporation&#x27;s responsibility including running the portions of the BC Electric Railway route still operating, for mass transit operation of the Vancouver trolley bus system (comprising a portion of the urban bus routes in Vancouver), as well as all the electric generation, transmission, and distribution operations. 

In 1988, BC Hydro sold its Gas Division which distributed natural gas in the Lower Mainland and Victoria to Inland Natural Gas. Inland changed its name to BC Gas, and was sold and changed name again to Terasen Gas in 2003. In 2007 Terasen sold the gas operation to FortisBC.

In 1988, BC Hydro&#x27;s remaining railway operations were sold to the Southern Railway of British Columbia. BC Hydro continues to own the railbed of the former BC Electric Railway interurban route through Burnaby and New Westminster (on which a portion of the Skytrain Expo Line was built), as well as the railway from North Delta through Surrey, Langley, and Abbotsford all the way to Chilliwack (which continues to be operated by Southern Rail). A segment of the BC Hydro route through Langley is also leased to BC Rail to link the Canadian National Railway mainline, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and the Roberts Bank Superport.

In 2003 the BC government passed several pieces of legislation to redefine and regulate power utilities in British Columbia. The Transmission Corporation Act created the British Columbia Transmission Corporation (BCTC) as an independent transmission provider, but which only lasted until 2010 until being re-merged back into BC Hydro.

Also in 2003, BC Hydro privatized and outsourced many of its support functions, including 1540 of its employees in its Customer Service, Westech IT Services, Network Computer Services, Human Resources, Financial Systems, Purchasing, and Building and Office Services groups. These services were first outsourced to Accenture, and later to Telus and Fujitsu.

==Modern era==

Between 1960 and 1980, BC Hydro completed six large hydro-electric generating projects. The first large dam was built on the Peace River near Hudson&#x27;s Hope. The W. A. C. Bennett Dam was built to create an energy reservoir for the Gordon M. Shrum Generating Station, which has a capacity of 2,730 Megawatts of electric power and generated 13,810 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year on average 2012–16. When it was completed in 1968, the dam was the largest earth-fill structure ever built. The Williston Lake reservoir is the largest lake in British Columbia. A second smaller concrete dam was later built downstream, closer to Hudson&#x27;s Hope for the Peace Canyon Generating Station which was completed in 1980.

Under the terms of the Columbia River Treaty with the US, BC Hydro built a number of dams and hydro-electric generating stations including two large projects at Mica and Revelstoke on the Columbia River. The Keenleyside Dam on the Columbia River north of Castlegar and the Duncan Dam north of Kootenay Lake were also built under the same treaty and are used mainly for water control. Two generators were installed at Keenleyside in 2002, though these are owned and operated by the Columbia Power Corporation (a separate Crown Corporation). Kootenay Canal Generating Station on the Kootenay River between Nelson and Castlegar was completed in 1976. The Seven Mile Dam and Generating Station on the Pend d&#x27;Oreille River near Trail were completed in 1979.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s BC Hydro investigated the feasibility of geothermal power production at Meager Creek, north of Pemberton. They concluded from their testing that the underground rock wasn&#x27;t permeable enough to justify large-scale production of electricity. Around the same time, BC Hydro initiated a project to develop a coal-fired thermal generating station at Hat Creek near Cache Creek, but abandoned the effort in 1981 due to strong environmental opposition.

In 1989 the Power Smart and Resource Smart programs were initiated by BC Hydro to promote energy conservation as an alternative to the cost of creating new generating facilities. Since 2001, BC Hydro has focused on its conservation and energy efficiency programs, re-investing in its existing facilities, and purchasing clean, renewable energy from Independent Power Producers. According to the &quot;British Columbia Energy Plan&quot;, released in 2007, BC Hydro must ensure that clean or renewable electricity generation continues to account for at least 90 percent of total generation. As of 2014, 97 percent of BC Hydro&#x27;s electricity generation comes from clean or renewable sources and this generation only emits 730,000 tonnes of annually from thermal plants.

==Organization and financial performance==

In 1980 the BC Government established the BC Utilities Commission (BCUC) to regulate public energy utilities and to act as an independent, quasi-judicial regulatory agency regarding energy rates. BC Hydro&#x27;s operations are overseen by this commission, and governed through an Electric Tariff and an Open Access Transmission Tariff.

===Site C Dam===
While BC Hydro initially looked at Site C on the Peace River near Fort St. John in the late 1950s, it wasn&#x27;t until 1982 that it submitted a Site C development project to the British Columbia Utilities Commission (BCUC). It was turned down by the BCUC at that time. Another attempt to revive it in the 1990s was blocked by environmental concerns. In 2004 the BC government&#x27;s Energy Plan instructed BC Hydro to begin discussions with First Nations, the Province of Alberta and communities to discuss Site C as a future option. In May 2014, a federal-provincial Joint Review Panel released a report into the project&#x27;s environmental, economic, social, heritage, and health effects. A notice of Site C construction commencing in 2015 was issued July 2015. Revelstoke Dam built in 1984 was the last new dam built by BC Hydro.

===Independent Power Producers===

The BC Hydro Public Power Legacy and Heritage Contract Act requires BC Hydro to meet the province&#x27;s future needs for power through private developers. These acts have allowed Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to sell power to BC Hydro, which is required by law to buy it from them even at a loss. In 2011 BC Hydro spent $567.4 million on electricity from IPPs. In 2013, BC Hydro had 127 Electricity Purchase Agreements in its supply portfolio, representing 22,200 gigawatt hours of annual energy and over 5,500 megawatts of capacity. In 2013 those purchases will be $781.8 million in 2013 and $939.8 million in 2014, representing about 20% of domestic supply.

=== Exports and Imports ===
Through its interties, BC Hydro exports and imports electric power through its wholly owned power marketing and trading subsidiary, Powerex, which was established in 1988. Powerex also markets the Canadian Entitlement energy from the Columbia River Treaty. BC Hydro belongs to a power sharing consortium which includes electric utilities in Alberta, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California. The flexibility of the interties contributes to system reliability, for example importing energy in low-water years, or importing when there is a system contingency. In 2013 British Columbia&#x27;s minister of energy and mines, Bill Bennett spoke to why BC Hydro was agreeing to a $750 million settlement with California over claims Powerex manipulated electricity prices.

=== Financial performance ===
==Renewable energy and conservation initiatives==

BC Hydro&#x27;s Power Smart program encourages energy conservation among its residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The program also aims to promote energy saving retail products and building construction, and includes a &quot;Sustainable Communities Program&quot;. Its in-house Resource Smart program is used to identify and implement efficiency gains at existing BC Hydro facilities. BC Hydro also practices energy conservation at its generating facilities through the continuous monitoring and efficient use of the water resources used to power its generators.

BC Hydro was committed by the BC government&#x27;s Energy Plan to achieve electric power self-sufficiency in the province by 2016, with all new generation plants having zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the same year. In 2013, BC Hydro released an Integrated Resource Plan which includes meeting at least 66 percent of the expected increase in electricity demand through increased energy efficiency.

BC Hydro has also entered into energy purchase contracts with a new category of company created by special legislation, Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to buy electricity generated from intermittent renewable sources, mainly from small capacity run of river hydro and more recently, wind power, wood residue energy, and energy from organic municipal waste. There has been some criticism of this policy on the basis that it will result in Hydro paying significantly higher rates to private producers than it would have if the power were self-generated.

BC has a policy not to develop nuclear power.

As of July 2018, BC Hydro operated 58 electric vehicle charging stations in the province.

In 2024, BC Hydro initiated agreements for nine wind farm projects, expected to collectively generate nearly 5,000 gigawatt hours annually, increasing the grid&#x27;s capacity by 8% by 2031. This C$6 billion investment in wind energy underscores BC Hydro&#x27;s efforts to meet growing electricity demand with sustainable solutions.

==Cost of Electricity==
In November 2013 the BC Minister of Energy and Mines announced a 10-year plan that will keep electricity rates as low as possible. Increases during the first five years will be between 9 and 3 percent annually. BC Hydro&#x27;s profitability is affected by its large debt, estimated to reach five billion dollars by 2017.

==Smart Meters==
BC Hydro&#x27;s Smart Metering Program in 2011 introduced the installation of Itron C2S0D Smart meters as mandatory. In 2013 BC Hydro offered the Meter Choices Program for $20 to $30 monthly.

<text>Science policy is concerned with the allocation of resources for the conduct of science towards the goal of best serving the public interest. Topics include the funding of science, the careers of scientists, and the translation of scientific discoveries into technological innovation to promote commercial product development, competitiveness, economic growth and economic development. Science policy focuses on knowledge production and role of knowledge networks, collaborations, and the complex distributions of expertise, equipment, and know-how. Understanding the processes and organizational context of generating novel and innovative science and engineering ideas is a core concern of science policy. Science policy topics include weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.

Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve science. A large and complex web of factors influences the development of science and engineering that includes government science policymakers, private firms (including both national and multi-national firms), social movements, media, non-governmental organizations, universities, and other research institutions. In addition, science policy is increasingly international as defined by the global operations of firms and research institutions as well as by the collaborative networks of non-governmental organizations and of the nature of scientific inquiry itself.

==History==
State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and the study of defensive fortifications during the Warring States period in China. General levies of labor and grain were collected to fund great public works in China, including the accumulation of grain for distribution in times of famine, for the building of levees to control flooding by the great rivers of China, for the building of canals and locks to connect rivers of China, some of which flowed in opposite directions to each other, and for the building of bridges across these rivers. These projects required a civil service, the scholars, some of whom demonstrated great mastery of hydraulics.

In Italy, Galileo noted that individual taxation of minute amounts could fund large sums to the State, which could then fund his research on the trajectory of cannonballs, noting that &quot;each individual soldier was being paid from coin collected by a general tax of pennies and farthings, while even a million of gold would not suffice to pay the entire army.&quot;

In Great Britain, Lord Chancellor Sir Francis Bacon had a formative effect on science policy with his identification of &quot;experiments of ... light, more penetrating into nature [than what others know]&quot;, which today we call the crucial experiment. Governmental approval of the Royal Society recognized a scientific community which exists to this day. British prizes for research spurred the development of an accurate, portable chronometer, which directly enabled reliable navigation and sailing on the high seas, and also funded Babbage&#x27;s computer.

The professionalization of science, begun in the nineteenth century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and State funding of universities of their respective nations. In the United States, a member of the National Academy of Sciences can sponsor a Direct Submission for publication in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;. &quot;PNAS&quot; serves as a channel to recognize research of importance to at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment, intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations who fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government in July 1945, wrote &quot;Science is a proper concern of government&quot; Vannevar Bush directed the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, and his writings directly inspired researchers to invent the hyperlink and the computer mouse. The DARPA initiative to support computing was the impetus for the Internet Protocol stack. In the same way that scientific consortiums like CERN for high-energy physics have a commitment to public knowledge, access to this public knowledge in physics led directly to CERN&#x27;s sponsorship of development of the World Wide Web and standard Internet access for all.

==Philosophies of science policy==
===Basic versus applied research===

The programs that are funded are often divided into four basic categories: basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment. Translational research is a newer concept that seeks to bridge the gap between basic science and practical applications.

Basic science attempts to stimulate breakthroughs. Breakthroughs often lead to an explosion of new technologies and approaches. Once the basic result is developed, it is widely published; however conversion into a practical product is left for the free market. However, many governments have developed risk-taking research and development organizations to take basic theoretical research over the edge into practical engineering. In the U.S., this function is performed by DARPA.

In contrast, technology development is a policy in which engineering, the application of science, is supported rather than basic science. The emphasis is usually given to projects that increase important strategic or commercial engineering knowledge. The most extreme success story is undoubtedly the Manhattan Project that developed nuclear weapons. Another remarkable success story was the &quot;X-vehicle&quot; studies that gave the US a lasting lead in aerospace technologies.

These exemplify two disparate approaches: The Manhattan Project was huge, and spent freely on the most risky alternative approaches. The project members believed that failure would result in their enslavement or destruction by Nazi Germany. Each X-project built an aircraft whose only purpose was to develop a particular technology. The plan was to build a few cheap aircraft of each type, fly a test series, often to the destruction of an aircraft, and never design an aircraft for a practical mission. The only mission was technology development.

A number of high-profile technology developments have failed. The US Space Shuttle failed to meet its cost or flight schedule goals. Most observers explain the project as over constrained: the cost goals too aggressive, the technology and mission too underpowered and undefined.

The Japanese fifth generation computer systems project met every technological goal, but failed to produce commercially important artificial intelligence. Many observers believe that the Japanese tried to force engineering beyond available science by brute investment. Half the amount spent on basic research rather might have produced ten times the result.

=== Utilitarian versus monumental science policy ===
Utilitarian policies prioritize scientific projects that significantly reduce suffering for larger numbers of people. This approach would mainly consider the numbers of people that can be helped by a research policy. Research is more likely to be supported when it costs less and has greater benefits. Utilitarian research often pursues incremental improvements rather than dramatic advancements in knowledge, or break-through solutions, which are more commercially viable.

In contrast, monumental science is a policy in which science is supported for the sake of a greater understanding of the universe, rather than for specific short-term practical goals. This designation covers both large projects, often with large facilities, and smaller research that does not have obvious practical applications and are often overlooked. While these projects may not always have obvious practical outcomes, they provide education of future scientists, and advancement of scientific knowledge of lasting worth about the basic building blocks of science.

Practical outcomes do result from many of these &quot;monumental&quot; science programs. Sometimes these practical outcomes are foreseeable and sometimes they are not. A classic example of a monumental science program focused towards a practical outcome is the Manhattan project. An example of a monumental science program that produces unexpected practical outcome is the laser. Coherent light, the principle behind lasing, was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, but not created until 1954 by Charles H. Townes with the maser. The breakthrough with the maser led to the creation of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman. The delay between the theory of coherent light and the production of the laser was partially due to the assumption that it would be of no practical use.

===Scholastic conservation===
This policy approach prioritizes efficiently teaching all available science to those who can use it, rather than investing in new science. In particular, the goal is not to &quot;lose&quot; any existing knowledge, and to find new practical ways to apply the available knowledge. The classic success stories of this method occurred in the 19th century U.S. land-grant universities, which established a strong tradition of research in practical agricultural and engineering methods. More recently, the Green Revolution prevented mass famine over the last thirty years. The focus, unsurprisingly, is usually on developing a robust curriculum and inexpensive practical methods to meet local needs.

== By country ==

Most developed countries usually have a specific national body overseeing national science (including technology and innovation) policy. Many developing countries follow the same fashion. Many governments of developed countries provide considerable funds (primarily to universities) for scientific research (in fields such as physics and geology) as well as social science research (in fields such as economics and history). Much of this is not intended to provide concrete results that may be commercialisable, although research in scientific fields may lead to results that have such potential. Most university research is aimed at gaining publication in peer reviewed academic journals.

A funding body is an organisation that provides research funding in the form of research grants or scholarships. Research councils are funding bodies that are government-funded agencies engaged in the support of research in different disciplines and postgraduate funding. Funding from research councils is typically competitive. As a general rule, more funding is available in science and engineering disciplines than in the arts and social sciences.

===Australia===
In Australia, the two main research councils are the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council.

===Canada===
In Canada, the three main research councils (&quot;Tri-Council&quot;) are the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). Additional research funding agencies include the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Genome Canada, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, Mitacs and several Tri-Council supported Networks of Centres of Excellence.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, two important research agencies are the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Portuguese: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), an organization of the Brazilian federal government under the Ministry of Science and Technology, and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Portuguese: Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo), a public foundation located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

===European Union===
The science policy of the European Union is carried out through the European Research Area, a system which integrates the scientific resources of member nations and acts as a &quot;common market&quot; for research and innovation. The European Union&#x27;s executive body, the European Commission, has a Directorate-General for Research, which is responsible for the Union&#x27;s science policy. In addition, the Joint Research Centre provides independent scientific and technical advice to the European Commission and Member States of the European Union (EU) in support of EU policies. There is also the recently established European Research Council, the first European Union funding body set up to support investigator-driven research.

There are also European science agencies that operate independently of the European Union, such as the European Science Foundation, European Space Agency, and the European Higher Education Area, created by the Bologna process.

The European environmental research and innovation policy addresses global challenges of pivotal importance for the well-being of European citizens within the context of sustainable development and environmental protection. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.

=== Germany ===
German research funding agencies include the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which covers both science and humanities.

=== India ===
Research funding by the Government of India comes from a number of sources. For basic science and technology research, these include the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Science and Technology (DST), and University Grants Commission (UGC). For medical research, these include the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), CSIR, DST and Department of Biotechnology (DBT). For applied research, these include the CSIR, DBT and Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).

Other funding authorities are the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Department of Ocean Development (DOD), the Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR), and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) etc.

=== Ireland ===
Irish funding councils include the Irish Research Council (IRC) and the Science Foundation Ireland. The prior Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET) and the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) were merged to form the IRC in March 2012.

=== The Netherlands ===
Dutch research funding agencies include Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) and Agentschap NL . In 2016, the Netherlands began trials for Self-Organized Funding Allocation (SOFA), a novel method of distributing research funds which proponents believe may have advantages compared to the grant system.

=== Pakistan ===
The Government of Pakistan has mandated that a certain percentage of gross revenue generated by all telecom service providers be allocated to development and research of information and communication technologies. The National ICT R&amp;D Fund was established in January 2007.

===Russia===
Under the Soviet Union, much research was routinely suppressed.
Now science in Russia is supported by state and private funds. From the state: the Russian Humanitarian Scientific Foundation (http://www.rfh.ru), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (www.rfbr.ru), the Russian Science Foundation (http://rscf.ru)

=== Sri Lanka ===
Science and Technology Policy Research Division (STPRD) of the National Science Foundation (NSF), which was established as a statutory body, through an Act of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, is engaged in providing evidence based policy recommendations for policy formulation on science, technology and other fields ensuring the research/innovation eco-system of the country. Accordingly, the Division undertake science, technology and innovation policy research in the areas of importance to make recommendations for policy formulation.

Besides NSF, the national experts, researchers, public universities and non-governmental bodies like National Academy of Sciences of Sri Lanka (NASSL), also provides expert advice on policy matters to the Government.

=== Switzerland ===
Swiss research funding agencies include the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the innovation promotion agency CTI (CTI/KTI), Ressortforschung des Bundes , and Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht .

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the Haldane principle, that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians, is still influential in research policy. There are several university departments with a focus on science policy, such as the Science Policy Research Unit. There are seven grant-awarding Research Councils:
* Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)
* Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)
* Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)
* Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)
* Medical Research Council (MRC)
* Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
* Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)

===United States===
The United States has a long history of government support for science and technology. Science policy in the United States is the responsibility of many organizations throughout the federal government. Much of the large-scale policy is made through the legislative budget process of enacting the yearly federal budget. Further decisions are made by the various federal agencies which spend the funds allocated by Congress, either on in-house research or by granting funds to outside organizations and researchers.

Research funding agencies in the United States are spread among many different departments, which include:
* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
* United States Department of Energy Office of Science
* National Institutes of Health: biomedical research
* National Science Foundation: fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering.
* Office of Naval Research

<doc id="317283" wikidata="Q2855776" url="?curid=317283" title="John Somers, 1st Baron Somers">
<text>John Somers, 1st Baron Somers, (4 March 1651 – 26 April 1716) was an English jurist, Whig statesman and peer. Somers first came to national attention in the trial of the Seven Bishops where he was on their defence counsel. He published tracts on political topics such as the succession to the crown, where he elaborated his Whig principles in support of the Exclusionists. He played a leading part in shaping the Revolution settlement. He was Lord High Chancellor of England under King William III and was a chief architect of the union between England and Scotland achieved in 1707 and the Protestant succession achieved in 1714. He was a leading Whig during the twenty-five years after 1688; with four colleagues he formed the Whig Junto.

==Early life==

He was born at Claines, near Worcester, the eldest son of John Somers, an attorney in a large practice in that town, who had formerly fought on the side of the Parliament, and of Catherine Ceaverne of Shropshire. After being at school at Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School, Walsall, and The King&#x27;s School, Worcester he was entered as a gentleman commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, and afterwards studied law under Sir Francis Winnington, who became solicitor-general, and joined the Middle Temple.

==Early political career==
He soon became intimate with the leaders of the country party, especially with Lord Essex, William Russell, and Algernon Sidney but never entered into their plans so far as to commit himself beyond recall. He was the author of a pamphlet supporting the Exclusion Bill, &quot;A Brief History of the Succession, Collected out of the Records and the Most Authentick Historians&quot; (1680). Somers showed that Parliament had for centuries regulated the succession of the English crown against the arguments of those who believed that Parliament had no right to alter the succession. Before the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the Anglo-Saxon kings had been elected, and even after it Parliament had deposed kings and kings, in turn, had confirmed their title by Act of Parliament. Somers concluded:

...it hath been the constant opinion of all Ages that the Parliament of &quot;England&quot; had an unquestionable power to limit, restrain and qualify the Succession as they pleased, and that in all Ages they have put their power in practice; and that the Historian had reason for saying that seldom or never the third Heir in a right descent enjoyed the Crown of &quot;England&quot;.

He was reputed to have written the &quot;Just and Modest Vindication of the Two Last Parliaments&quot;, which was published in April 1681 as the answer to Charles II&#x27;s famous declaration of his reasons for dissolving them. The authorship of this has been disputed. According to Bishop Burnet it was &quot;first penned by Sidney; but a new draught was made by Somers, and corrected by Jones&quot;. Lord Hardwicke saw a copy in Somers&#x27;s handwriting amongst his manuscripts before they were destroyed by fire in 1752.

In 1681 Lord Shaftesbury was sent to the Tower of London without bail or recourse to a trial. In November he was charged at the Old Bailey for high treason, specifically for intending to levy war against the king. However, the grand jury of Middlesex threw out the bill against Lord Shaftesbury, and were vehemently attacked for so doing by government supporters. Somers published anonymously &quot;The Security of Englishmen&#x27;s Lives, or, The Trust, Power, and Duty of the Grand Juries of England&quot; in 1681. Somers acknowledged that judges may advise but juries &quot;are bound by their Oaths to present the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, to the best of their own, not the Judges&#x27;, Knowledge&quot;. The monarch must ensure that justice is carried out:

Whosoever hath learnt that the Kings of England were ordained for the good Government of the Kingdom in the Execution of the Laws, must needs know, that the King cannot lawfully seek any other benefit in judicial proceedings, than that common Right and Justice be done to the People according to their Laws and Customs.

Somers went on to argue that the monarch should hold the protection of the innocent above the punishment of the guilty:

If a Criminal should be acquitted wrongfully he may be reserved for future Justice from Man or God, if he doth not repent; but &#x27;tis impossible that satisfaction or reparation should be made for innocent Bloodshed in the forms of Justice.

In 1683 he was counsel for the sheriffs Thomas Pilkington and Samuel Shute before the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, and secured a reputation which continually increased until the trial of the Seven Bishops, in which he was junior counsel. One of the bishops objected that &quot;too young and obscure a Man&quot; should be retained on the defence counsel but Sir Henry Pollexfen refused to participate in the trial without him, saying that Somers was &quot;the Man who would take most Pains, and go deepest into all that depended on Precedents and Records&quot;. In Macaulay&#x27;s words: &quot;Somers rose last. He spoke little more than five minutes: but every word was full of weighty matter; and when he sate down his reputation as an orator and a constitutional lawyer was established&quot;. In his speech Somers cited the case of Thomas v. Sorrel (1674) whereby it was ruled that no Act of Parliament could be abrogated except through Parliament. The bishops&#x27; petition had been described as a false, malicious and seditious libel. In his peroration Somers answered this charge:

My Lord, as to all the matters of fact alleged in the Petition,—that they are perfectly true we have shown by the Journals of both Houses. In every instance which the petitioners mention, this power of dispensation was considered in Parliament, and, on debate, declared to be contrary to law. They could have no design to diminish the prerogative because the King hath no such prerogative. Seditious, my Lord, the Petition could not be, for the matter of it must be seen to be strictly true. There could be nothing of malice, for the occasion, instead of being sought, was forced upon them. A libel it could not be, for the intent of the defendants was innocent, and they kept strictly within the bounds set by the law, which gives the subject leave to apply to his Prince by petition when he is aggrieved.

==Glorious Revolution==

In the secret councils of those who were planning the Glorious Revolution Somers took a leading part, and in the Convention Parliament was elected a member for Worcester. He was immediately appointed one of the managers for the Commons in the conferences between the houses, and in arguing the questions whether James II had left the throne vacant by abdication and whether the acts of the Convention Parliament were legal—that parliament having been summoned without the usual writs—he displayed great learning and legal subtlety.

In his maiden speech on 28 January 1689, Somers argued that James II had forfeited his claim to the allegiance of the English by casting himself into the hands of Louis XIV of France and conspiring &quot;to subject the Nation to the Pope, as much as to a foreign prince&quot;. On 6 February Somers advocated the word &quot;abdicate&quot; rather than &quot;desert&quot; (which the House of Lords favoured) to describe James&#x27; flight to France. He concluded by stating that James&#x27; actions were a prime example of the act of abdicating:

That King James II, by going about to subvert the constitution, and by breaking the original contract between king and people, and by violating the fundamental laws, and withdrawing himself out of the kingdom, hath thereby renounced to be a king according to the constitution, by avowing to govern by a despotic power, unknown to the constitution, and inconsistent with it; he hath renounced to be a king according to the law, such a king as he swore to be at his coronation, such a king to whom the allegiance of an English subject is due.

Challenged by the Lords to produce a precedent whereby England had been without a monarch, Somers referred to a parliamentary roll from 1399 that stated that the throne had been unoccupied between the reigns of Richard II and Henry IV. Somers could not point to the interregnum of 1649–1660 because by law the reign of Charles II had started after the execution of Charles I. The Lords replied by pointing to a roll from the first year of the reign of Edward IV which showed that the roll of 1399 had been annulled. Sir George Treby supported Somers by producing the roll of the first year of the reign of Henry VII which repealed Edward IV&#x27;s roll. Eventually the Lords accepted the abdication clause and that the throne was vacant at the behest of William, and passed a resolution affirming William and Mary&#x27;s right to the crown.

Although some historians such as Macaulay have claimed Somers was made chairman of the committee which drew up the Declaration of Right, the committee&#x27;s report was delivered to the Commons by Treby (the chairman always delivered the report to the House). However Somers did play a leading part in drawing up the Declaration, which would be passed in Parliament and become known as the Bill of Rights 1689. Although later generations exaggerated Somers&#x27; role as architect of the Bill of Rights, his biographer asserts that no one else can have a better claim to that title. Somers published anonymously &quot;A Vindication of the Proceedings of the Late Parliament of England&quot; in 1690. Here, Somers justified the war against France and the Bill of Rights:

The proceedings of the late parliament were so fair, so prudent, so necessary, and so advantageous to the nation, to the protestant interest in general, and in particular to the church of England, that all true Englishmen must needs acknowledge they owe to the then representatives of the nation, their privileges, their liberties, their lives, their religion, their present and future security from popery, slavery, and arbitrary power, had they done nothing else but enacted the rights and liberties of the subject, and settling the succession of the crown.

Somers went on to place the abolition of the dispensing power of sovereigns first in importance, then the parliamentary control of taxation, the outlawing of standing armies in time of peace unless Parliament decided otherwise, and the royal succession. Somers argued for the vital importance of the rule of law:

Our happiness then consists in this, that our princes are tied up to the law as well as we, and upon an especial account obliged to keep it up in full force, because if they destroyed the law, they destroyed at the same time themselves, by overthrowing the very foundation of their kingly grandeur and regal power. So that our government not being arbitrary, but legal, not absolute but political, our princes can never become arbitrary, absolute, or tyrants, without forfeiting at the same time their royal character, by the breach of the essential conditions of their regal power, which are to act according to the ancient customs and standing laws of the nation.

==Ministerial career==

In May 1689 Somers was made Solicitor General for England and Wales. He now became William III&#x27;s most confidential adviser. In the controversy which arose between the Houses on the question of the legality of the decision of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench regarding Titus Oates, and of the action of the Lords in sustaining this decision, Somers was again the leading manager for the Commons, and has left a clear and interesting account of the debates. He was next employed in January 1690 as chairman of the select committee of the House of Commons on the Corporation Bill, by which those corporations which had surrendered their charters to the Crown during the last two reigns were restored to their rights; but he refused to associate himself with the violent measures of retaliation which the Whigs on that occasion endeavoured to include in the bill.

Re-elected as MP for Worcester in March 1690, he gave a speech in April which carried through the lower house, without opposition, the bill which declared all the laws passed by the Convention Parliament (1689) to be valid. As Solicitor-General he had to conduct the prosecution of Lord Preston and John Ashton in 1691, and did so with moderation and humanity which were in marked contrast to the customs of the former reigns. He was soon after appointed Attorney General for England and Wales and in that capacity strongly opposed the Bill for the regulation of trials in cases of high treason. In December 1692 Somers introduced into the Commons a Bill &quot;for the preservation of their Majesties&#x27; persons and government&quot;. The two main provisions of the Bill were severe penalties for anyone who spoke or printed asserted or implied that William and Mary were monarchs only &quot;in fact&quot; and not &quot;of right&quot;, and a new oath for all who held offices of profit under the Crown in which they had to swear to defend the government against the exiled King James and his adherents. However the Bill was defeated by 200 to 175.

On 23 March 1693, the Great Seal of the Realm having meanwhile been in commission, Somers was appointed Lord Keeper, with a pension of £2000 a year from the day on which he should quit his office, and at the same time was made a privy councillor. He had previously been knighted. Somers now became the most prominent member of the Whig Junto, the small council which comprised the chief members of the Whig party. When William left in May 1695 to take command of the army in the Netherlands, Somers was made one of the seven Lords Justices to whom the administration of the kingdom during his absence was entrusted; and he was instrumental in bringing about a reconciliation between William and the Princess Anne.

In 1696 he delivered perhaps his best-known judgement in &quot;the Bankers case&quot;, a claim for compensation by several bankers who had suffered severe loss due to the Great Stop of the Exchequer of 1672 whereby the Crown had simply refused to pay its debts. The Court of Exchequer Chamber, after litigation of almost unprecedented length, found for the bankers; but Somers reversed the judgement on the technical point that the claim should have been brought by way of petition of right. Although his judgement was noted for erudition, it was much criticised for the result, in that the plaintiffs, after almost 25 years, were denied justice on a technicality. The House of Lords in turn reversed Somers&#x27;s judgement in 1700.

==Lord Chancellor and impeachment==
In April 1697 Somers was made Lord Chancellor, and was created a peer by the title of Baron Somers, of Evesham. When the discussion arose on the question of disbanding the army, he summed up the case against disbanding, in answer to John Trenchard in a remarkable pamphlet called &quot;The Balancing Letter.&quot; In August 1698 he went to Tunbridge Wells for his health. While there he received the king&#x27;s letter announcing the first Partition Treaty, and at once replied with a memorandum representing the necessity in the state of feeling in England of avoiding further war. When the king, on the occasion of the Disbanding Bill, expressed his determination to leave the country, Somers boldly remonstrated, while he dearly expressed in a speech in the Lords the danger of the course that was being taken. Hitherto Somers&#x27;s character had kept him free from attack at the hands of political opponents; but his connection in 1699 with the notorious Captain William Kidd, to the cost of whose expedition Somers had given £1,000, afforded an opportunity; the vote of censure, however, proposed upon him in the House of Commons for giving Kidd a commission under the great seal was rejected by 199 to 131. The attack was renewed shortly on the ground of his having accepted grants of Crown property to the amount of £1600 a year, but was again defeated. On the subject of the Irish forfeitures, a third attack was made in 1700, a motion being brought forward to request the king to remove Somers from his counsels and presence forever; but this again was rejected by a large majority. In consequence, however, of the incessant agitation William now requested Somers to resign; this he refused to do, but gave up the seals to William&#x27;s messenger. In 1701 he was impeached by the Commons on account of the part he had taken in the negotiations relating to the Partition Treaty in 1698, and defended himself most ably before the House, answering the charges &quot;seriatim&quot;. The impeachment was voted and sent up to the Lords, but was there dismissed. On the death of the King, Somers retired almost entirely into private life.

==Later life==
He was President of the Royal Society from 1698 to 1703. He was, however, active in 1702 in opposing the Occasional Conformity Bill, and in 1706 was one of the managers of the Act of Union 1707. In the same year, he carried a bill regulating and improving the proceedings of the law courts. He was made Lord President of the Council in 1708 upon the return of the Whigs to power, and retained the office until their downfall in 1710; while Queen Anne had long detested the Whig Junto, she came to like and admire Somers: Jonathan Swift called him &quot;the perfect courtier&quot; whose charm and good manners were almost irresistible. He spent his later years at Brookmans Park in Hertfordshire. Somers died on the day the Septennial Bill—which extended the maximum life of parliaments from three years to seven—passed the Commons. A story, possibly apocryphal, goes that Lord Townshend visited Somers during his last illness, with Somers saying to Townshend on his death bed:

I have just heard of the work in which you are engaged, and [I] congratulate you upon it. I never approved the Triennial Bill, and always considered it, in effect, the reverse of what it was intended. You have my hearty approbation of this business, and I think it will be the greatest support possible to the liberty of the country.

Somers never married, but left two sisters, of whom the eldest, Mary, married Charles Cocks, whose grandson, Charles became the second Baron Somers in 1784, the title subsequently descending in this line.

==Legacy==

Somers is immortalised in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament. In the eighteenth century, Somers was hailed as the chief constitutional architect of the Protestant succession. The achievements of Somers and other Whig lawyers defined Whiggism for those living in the reigns of King George I and George II. William Pitt the Elder stated in 1761 that &quot;he learnt his maxims and principles&quot; from &quot;the greatest lawyers, generals and patriots of King William&#x27;s days: named Lord Somers&quot;. For the later eighteenth-century Whig politician, Edmund Burke, Somers was of the &quot;Old Whigs&quot; whom he admired against the New Whigs who supported the French Revolution. Burke wrote: &quot;I never desire to be thought a better whig than Lord Somers&quot;. The Whig historian Thomas Macaulay, writing in the nineteenth century, held Somers in high esteem:

...the greatest man among the members of the Junto, and in some respects, the greatest man of that age, was the Lord Keeper Somers. He was equally eminent as a jurist and as a politician, as an orator, and as a writer. His speeches have perished; but his State papers remain, and are models of terse, luminous, and dignified eloquence. He had left a great reputation in the House of Commons, where he had, for four years, been always heard with delight; and the Whig members still looked up to him as their leader, and still held their meetings under his roof. ... In truth, he united all the qualities of a great judge, an intellect comprehensive, quick and acute, diligence, integrity, patience, suavity. In council, the calm wisdom, which he possessed in a measure rarely found among men of parts so quick and of opinions so decided as his, acquired for him the authority of an oracle. ... From the beginning to the end of his public life he was a steady Whig.

A fire at the law offices of Charles Yorke in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Square on 27 January 1752 destroyed a large amount of Somers&#x27;s surviving private papers.

The Town of Somers, Connecticut was incorporated in 1734 by the General Court of Massachusetts and named for Somers.

<text>Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Aemilianus (185 BC – 129 BC), known as Scipio Aemilianus or Scipio Africanus the Younger, was a Roman general and statesman noted for his military exploits in the Third Punic War against Carthage and during the Numantine War in Spain. He oversaw the final defeat and destruction of the city of Carthage. He was a prominent patron of writers and philosophers, the most famous of whom was the Greek historian Polybius. In politics, he opposed the populist reform program of his murdered brother-in-law, Tiberius Gracchus.

== Family ==

Scipio Aemilianus was the second son of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, the commander of the Romans&#x27; victorious campaign in the Third Macedonian War, and his first wife, Papiria Masonis. Scipio was adopted by his first cousin, Publius Cornelius Scipio, the eldest son of his aunt Aemilia Tertia and her husband Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the acclaimed commander who won the decisive battle of the Second Punic War against Hannibal. This made Scipio Africanus the adoptive grandfather of Scipio Aemilianus. On adoption, he became Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, assuming the name of his adoptive father, but keeping Aemilianus as a fourth name to indicate his original nomen. His elder brother was adopted by a son or grandson of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, another prominent commander in the Second Punic War, and his name became Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus.

== Military career ==
=== First involvement in a war (Third Macedonian War, 171–168 BC) ===
Lucius Aemilius Paullus took his two older sons with him on his campaign in Greece. Plutarch wrote that Scipio was his favorite son because he &quot;saw that he was by nature more prone to excellence than any of his brothers&quot;. He related that during mopping-up operations after the Battle of Pydna, Aemilius was worried because his younger son was missing. Plutarch also wrote that &quot;The whole army learned of the distress and anguish of their general, and springing up from their suppers, ran about with torches, many to the tent of Aemilius, and many in front of the ramparts, searching among the numerous dead bodies. Dejection reigned in the camp, and the plain was filled with the cries of men calling out the name of Scipio. For from the very outset he had been admired by everybody, since, beyond any other one of his family, he had a nature adapted for leadership in war and public service. Well, then, when it was already late and he was almost despaired of, he came in from the pursuit with two or three comrades, covered with the blood of the enemies he had slain ...&quot; Scipio Aemilianus was seventeen at the time.

=== First involvement in the Numantine War (151–150 BC) ===
In 152 BC, the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus urged the Senate to conclude a peace with the Celtiberians. The Senate rejected this proposal, and instead sent one of the consuls of 151 BC, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, to Hispania to continue the war. However, there was a crisis of recruitment due to rumors of incessant battles and heavy Roman losses. Additionally, Marcellus appeared to be afraid of continuing the war; this led to panic. Young men avoided enrollment as soldiers through unverifiable excuses. Men eligible to be legates (legion commanders) or military tribunes (senior officers) did not volunteer.

Scipio Aemilianus was thought to have advised for the prosecution of the war. He asked the Senate to be sent to Hispania either as a military tribune or a legate, due to the urgency of the situation, even though it would have been safer to go to Macedon, where he had been invited to settle domestic disputes. The Senate was at first surprised. Ultimately, Scipio&#x27;s decision made him popular, and many of those who had been avoiding their duty, ashamed by Scipio&#x27;s example, began to volunteer as legates or to enroll as soldiers.

Scipio served under Lucullus. Velleius Paterculus wrote that Scipio was awarded a mural crown, which was a military decoration awarded to the soldier who first climbed the wall of a besieged city or fortress and successfully placed the military standard on it. Florus wrote that &quot;having been challenged by [the Celtiberian] king to a single combat, carried off the spolia opima, the armor and arms stripped from the body of an opposing commander slain in single combat. These were regarded as the most honorable of all war trophies.&quot;

=== Third Punic War (149–146 BC) ===

Although the power of Carthage had been broken with her defeat in the Second Punic War, there was still lingering resentment in Rome. Cato the Elder ended every speech with, &quot;Carthage must be destroyed.&quot; In 150 BC an appeal was made to Scipio Aemilianus by the Carthaginians to act as a mediator between them and the Numidian prince Massinissa who, supported by the anti-Carthaginian faction in Rome, was incessantly encroaching on Carthaginian territory. After winning the Second Punic War, Rome had mandated that Carthage could not defend itself militarily without seeking Rome&#x27;s permission first. Rome construed Carthage&#x27;s defense of itself against Numidians as a violation of this agreement. In 149 BC Rome declared war and a force was sent to besiege Carthage.

In the early stages of the war, the Romans suffered repeated defeats. Scipio Aemilianus was a military tribune (senior officer) and distinguished himself repeatedly: After a failed Roman attack into Carthage itself, it was Aemilianus who prevented a disaster by covering the army&#x27;s retreat from the city. When the Carthaginians launched a surprise night-time attack on the camp of consul Censorinus, it was Aemilianus who rallied part of the cavalry, led them out of a rear gate and attacked the Carthaginians in the flank, driving them back to the city and restoring the situation. While collecting supplies from the countryside, Aemilius was one of the few who managed to prevent his foraging party from being ambushed. When the Carthaginians mounted another surprise night-time attack on a fort protecting the Roman transport ships, it was Aemilianus who led out his men and drove off the assault party using a clever stratagem. During a Roman attack on Hasdrubal&#x27;s forces near Nepheris he again prevented disaster by checking the Carthaginian counter-attack which hit the Roman army when it was in a disadvantaged position. 

In 147 BC he was elected consul, while still under the minimum age required by law to hold this office. Without the customary procedure of drawing lots, he was assigned to the African theater of war. After a year of desperate fighting and stubborn heroism on the part of the defenders, he took the city of Carthage, taking prisoner about 50,000 survivors (about one-tenth of the city&#x27;s population). Complying with the mandate of the Senate, he ordered the city evacuated, burnt it, razed it to the ground and plowed it over, ending the Third Punic War. It was formerly believed that he also salted the city, but modern scholars have found no evidence for that. On his return to Rome he received a Triumph, having also established a personal claim to his adoptive &quot;agnomen&quot; of Africanus. According to Pliny the Elder he was also awarded the grass crown in Africa during the war.

=== Numantine War (143–133 BC) ===
In 134 BC Scipio was elected consul again because the citizens thought that he was the only man capable of defeating the Numantines in the Numantine War. The Celtiberians of the City of Numantia, which had strong defensive geographical features, held off the Romans for nine years. The army in Hispania was demoralized and ill-disciplined. Scipio concentrated on restoring discipline by forbidding luxuries the troops had become accustomed to, through regular tough exercises (all-day marches, building camps and fortifications and then demolishing them, digging ditches and then filling them up, and the like) and by enforcing regulations strictly. When he thought that the army was ready he encamped near Numantia. He did not proceed along the shorter route to avoid the guerrilla tactics the Numantines were good at. Instead, he made a detour though the land of the Vaccaei, who were selling food to the Numantines. He was ambushed several times but defeated the enemy. In one of these ambushes by a river which was difficult to cross, he was forced to make a detour along a longer route where there was no water. He marched at night when it was cooler and dug wells which had bitter water. He saved his men, but some horses and pack animals died of thirst. Then he passed through the territory of the Caucaei who had broken the treaty with Rome and declared that they could return safely to their homes. He returned to the Numantine territory and was joined by Jugurtha, the son of the king of Numidia, with archers, slingers, and twelve elephants.

Eventually, Scipio prepared to besiege Numantia. He asked the allied tribes in Hispania for specified numbers of troops. He built a circuit of fortifications which was nine kilometers long. The wall was three meters high and two and a half meters wide. He built an embankment of the same dimensions as the wall around the adjoining marsh. He built two towers by the River Durius (Douro) to which he moored large timbers with ropes which were full of knives and spear heads and were constantly kept in motion by the current. This prevented the enemy from slipping through covertly. He managed to force Numantia into starvation. The Numantines surrendered. Some killed themselves. Scipio sold the rest into slavery, destroyed the city and kept fifty men for his triumph. For his success Scipio Aemilianus received the additional &quot;agnomen&quot; of &quot;Numantinus&quot;.

== Political career ==
=== Censorship ===
In 142 BC Scipio Aemilianus was a censor. During his censorship, he endeavoured to check the growing luxury and immorality of the period. In 139 BC, he was unsuccessfully accused of high treason by Tiberius Claudius Asellus, whom he had degraded when censor. The speeches he gave on that occasion (now lost) were considered brilliant.

=== Tiberius Gracchus ===
Scipio helped his relative Tiberius Gracchus who in 137 BC had served in the Numantine War as a quaestor (treasurer) under the consul Gaius Hostilius Mancinus. The consul was pinned down by the enemy and, unable to escape, made a peace treaty. Tiberius negotiated the peace terms. The treaty was rejected by the senate as a disgrace. Plutarch wrote that &quot;the relatives and friends of the soldiers, who formed a large part of the people&quot; blamed this on Mancinus and insisted &quot;that it was due to Tiberius that the lives of so many citizens had been saved&quot;. Those who disagreed with the violation of the treaty &quot;cast forth those who had taken hand and share in the treaty, as for instance the quaestors and military tribunes, turning upon their heads the guilt of perjury and violation of the pact. In the present affair, indeed, more than at any other time, the people showed their good will and affection towards Tiberius. For they voted to deliver up the consul unarmed and in bonds to the Numantines, but spared all the other officers for the sake of Tiberius.&quot; Scipio used his influence to help to save the men &quot;but none the less he was blamed for not saving Mancinus, and for not insisting that the treaty with the Numantines, which had been made through the agency of his kinsman and friend Tiberius, should be kept inviolate.&quot;

The Encyclopædia Britannica suggests that Scipio Aemilianus was not in sympathy with the optimates, the political faction which supported the aristocracy. Whatever the case, he was in disagreement with the militant actions of the movement led by Gracchus when he was a plebeian tribune, which pressed for a law to redistribute land to the poor. Plutarch wrote that &quot;this disagreement certainly resulted in no mischief past remedy&quot; and thought that if Scipio had been in Rome during the political activity of Gracchus, the latter would not have been murdered - he was fighting the war in Hispania. Still, he disliked the actions of Gracchus. Plutarch wrote &quot;[while] at Numantia, when he learned of the death of Tiberius, he recited in a loud voice the verse of Homer: [from the Odyssey I.47] &quot;So perish also all others who on such wickedness venture.&quot; Plutarch also wrote that (after his return to Rome) &quot;when Gaius and Fulvius asked him in an assembly of the people what he thought about the death of Tiberius, he made a reply which showed his dislike of the measures advocated by him,&quot; this made him unpopular, &quot;the people began to interrupt him as he was speaking, a thing which they had never done before, and Scipio himself was thereby led on to abuse the people.&quot; Gaius Papirius Carbo was a plebeian tribune and Marcus Fulvius Flaccus was a senator sympathetic to the Gracchian cause.

Scipio made himself unpopular again. Appian related that Fulvius Flaccus, Papirius Carbo and Tiberius’ younger brother, Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, chaired a commission to implement the Gracchian law. There never had been a land survey and land owners often did not have land deeds. The land was resurveyed. Some owners had to give up their orchards and farm buildings and go to empty land or move from cultivated to uncultivated land or swamps. As anyone was allowed to work undistributed land, many tilled land next to their own, blurring the demarcation between public and private land. Rome&#x27;s Italian allies complained about lawsuits brought against them and chose Scipio Aemilianus to defend them. As the allies had fought in his wars, he accepted. In the senate Scipio did not criticise the Law, but argued that the cases should be heard by a court rather than the commission which did not have the confidence of the litigants. This was accepted and the consul Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus was appointed to give judgment. However, seeing that the job was difficult he found a pretext to fight a war in Illyria. The people were angry at Scipio &quot;because they saw a man, in whose favour they had often opposed the aristocracy and incurred their enmity, electing him consul twice contrary to law, now taking the side of the Italian allies against themselves&quot; His enemies claimed that he was determined to abolish the Gracchian law and was about to start &quot;armed strife and bloodshed&quot;. When the people heard these allegations they were in a state of alarm until Scipio died at home in his bed; according to Appian, without a wound.

=== Death and possible assassination ===

Modern historians believe &quot;there is no strong evidence or credible argument to support any alternative hypothesis [from death by natural causes]&quot;. The ancient sources, however, record various different rumours of foul play.

Appian wrote that it could not be known whether Scipio was murdered by Cornelia (the mother of the Gracchi brothers) and her daughter Sempronia (who was married to Scipio), who were worried that the Gracchian law might be repealed, or whether he committed suicide because he saw that he could not deliver on his promises. He added that &quot;[s]ome say that slaves under torture testified that unknown persons were introduced through the rear of the house by night who suffocated him, and that those who knew about it hesitated to tell because the people were angry with him still and rejoiced at his death.&quot;

Plutarch wrote that &quot;although Scipio Africanus died at home after dinner, there is no convincing proof of the manner of his end, but some say that he died naturally, being of a sickly habit, some that he died of poison administered by his own hand, and some that his enemies broke into his house at night and smothered him. And yet Scipio&#x27;s dead body lay exposed for all to see, and all who beheld it formed therefrom some suspicion and conjecture of what had happened to it.&quot; In another book Plutarch wrote &quot;no cause of such an unexpected death could be assigned, only some marks of blows upon his body seemed to intimate that he had suffered violence.&quot; The heaviest suspicions fell on Fulvius Flaccus who &quot;that very day had reflected upon Scipio in a public address to the people&quot;.

Gaius Gracchus also came under suspicion. However, &quot;this great outrage, committed too upon the person of the greatest and most considerable man in Rome, was never either punished or inquired into thoroughly, for the populace opposed and hindered any judicial investigation, for fear that Gaius should be implicated in the charge if proceedings were carried on&quot;. Gaius Papirius Carbo also came under accusation. During a trial Lucius Licinius Crassus accused Carbo of being a party to the murder of Scipio.

== Personal character ==

Velleius Paterculus wrote that Scipio was &quot;a cultivated patron and admirer of liberal studies and of every form of learning, and kept constantly with him, at home and in the field, two men of eminent genius, Polybius and Panaetius. No one ever relieved the duties of an active life by a more refined use of his intervals of leisure than Scipio, or was more constant in his devotion to the arts either of war or peace. Ever engaged in the pursuit of arms or his studies, he was either training his body by exposing it to dangers or his mind by learning.&quot; Polybius mentioned going to Africa with Scipio to explore the continent. Gellius wrote that Scipio &quot;used the purest diction of all men of his time&quot;. Cicero cited him among the orators who were &quot;a little more emphatic than the ordinary, [but] never strained their lungs or shouted …&quot; It seems that he had a good sense of humour and Cicero cited a number of anecdotes about his puns. He is also a central character in Book VI of Cicero&#x27;s De re publica, a passage known as the Somnium Scipionis or &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;.

Culturally, Scipio Aemilianus was both philhellenic and conservative. He was the patron of the so-called Scipionic circle, a group of 15 to 27 philosophers, poets, and politicians. Besides Roman satirists and comedy writers such as Lucilius and Terence, there were Greek intellectuals, such as the scholar and historian Polybius and the Stoic philosopher Panaetius. Hence, Scipio had a philhellenic disposition (love and admiration for Greek culture). Such disposition was criticised by Roman traditionalists who disliked the growing Hellenisation of Rome—which, they thought, was corrupting Roman culture and life through alien influences—and advocated adherence to old Roman traditions and ancestral virtues and mores. Yet, Scipio was also a supporter of such traditions and mores. Gellius wrote that when he was censor, Scipio made a speech &quot;urging the people to follow the customs of their forefathers&quot;. He criticised several things which &quot;were done contrary to the usage of our forefathers,&quot; and found fault with adoptive sons being of profit to their adoptive father in gaining the rewards of paternity, and said: &quot;A father votes in one tribe, the son in another, an adopted son is of as much advantage as if one had a son of his own; orders are given to take the census of absentees, and hence it is not necessary for anyone to appear in person at the census.&quot;

Gellius wrote that after he was censor, Scipio was accused before the people by Tiberius Claudius Asellus, a plebeian tribune, whom he had stripped of his knighthood during his censorship. He does not mention what the accusation was. Although under accusation, Scipio did not stop to shave and to wear white clothing and did not appear in the garb of those under accusation. He added that in those days noblemen started shaving in middle age. The satirist Lucilius wrote a verse about the episode: &quot;Thus base Asellus did great Scipio taunt: Unlucky was his censorship and bad.&quot;

Polybius relates a well-known anecdote of Scipio&#x27;s reflections on the mutability of human affairs following the sack of Carthage:

==In popular culture==
Scipio Aemilianus is portrayed as a young boy in the household of his adopted grandfather in the 1971 film &quot;Scipio the African&quot;.
The name &quot;Scipio&quot; was used in the animated series, &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; in reference to the general&#x27;s destruction of Carthage. He is also portrayed in the anime &quot;Drifters&quot;. His figure also appeared on Rise of Kingdoms games as one of the commanders that excelled at leading rallies.

<doc id="317287" wikidata="Q285755" url="?curid=317287" title="Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio">
<text>Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio (182 or 181 – 132 BC) was a Roman politician. He is most well known for mobilising the mob which killed Tiberius Gracchus, who was at the time attempting to stand for re-election as plebeian tribune in 133 BC. He was consul in 138 BC and served as pontifex maximus, from possibly 141 through to his death in 132 BC.

== Career ==

Nasica&#x27;s first known public office was that of military tribune, which T.R.S. Broughton provisionally dated to 149 BC in &quot;Magistrates of the Roman Republic&quot;. If he held that office, he would have been an officer during the Third Punic War and the siege of Carthage. Alexander Yakobson, writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Ancient History&quot;, tentatively identifies this Scipio with the one who committed a gaffe when, during a canvass for the aedileship, he asked whether a farmer with rough hands had a habit of walking on his hands.

Nasica had become praetor by 141 BC, and may have been the Cornelius who in that year was defeated by the Scordisci. Around that year, his father died and he was elected to a pontificate in his place. He may have become pontifex maximus in that year, but the specifics of when he was elected to that post are unclear.

His next magistracy was the consulate of 138 BC. During his year, he and his co-consul – Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus – were charged with investigation into murders. The colleagues also were imprisoned by a plebeian tribune that year due to their refusal to exempt certain persons from the levy.

== Killing of Tiberius Gracchus ==

In 133 BC, Tiberius Gracchus – his first cousin – was tribune of plebs. Nasica clashed with Tiberius over his agrarian reform bill, which would have redistributed public land (much of which was already occupied) to poor Roman households. After Tiberius secured passage of the reforms with the unprecedented gambit of deposing one of his sacrosanct tribunician colleagues, it was Nasica in the Senate who apparently proposed and carried funding the commission with a nugatory grant.

During the elections of that year, Tiberius attempted – in a serious breach of republican norms – to secure consecutive re-election as tribune, &quot;which suggested an unrepublican attempt to seize power&quot;, especially when in the context of Tiberius&#x27; actions that year which &quot;represented clear contraventions of accepted rules&quot;. A meeting of the Senate was called near the electoral comitia, which Nasica attended. Claiming that one of Tiberius&#x27; gestures indicated a request for a diadem, Nasica urged the presiding consul – Publius Mucius Scaevola – to defend the republic and kill the tyrant. After Scaevola refused, Nasica incited a mob of senators – with the phrase &quot;anyone who wants the community secure, follow me&quot;, traditional for calling a levy of troops, – and marched on the comitia, putting the hem of his toga upon his head, customary during religious sacrifice. This was an attempt to re-enact &quot;an ancient religious ritual killing... presumably on the grounds that [Tiberius] was trying to seize power and overthrow the existing republic&quot;. Joined by one of the other tribunes and a large number of senators, the mob dispersed the comitia. Tiberius was killed, supposedly by one of his fellow tribunes.

In the aftermath of the violence, Nasica was challenged in a legal wager to defend his actions. While the consul Scaevola – a renowned jurist – was proposed as judge, Nasica refused to accept the wager. Shortly thereafter, even though he was pontifex maximus and probably to remove him from the city amid opprobrium, he was sent on an embassy to Pergamum, where he died.

== Family and personal life ==

Nasica belonged to a patrician branch of the gens Cornelia. He was the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum, who had served twice as consul (in 162 and 155 BC), as censor in 159 BC, and as pontifex maximus since 150 BC. His grandfather was the Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica who had been consul in 191 BC.

This Nasica was the father of a largely homonymous son who later achieved the consulship in 111 BC. He was also the great-grandfather of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, the consul of 52 BC.

<doc id="317295" wikidata="Q1788801" url="?curid=317295" title="Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden">
<text>Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden KG, PC, KS, JP (30 April 1544), was an English barrister and judge who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1533 to 1544.

==Early life==
Audley was born in Earls Colne, Essex, the son of Geoffrey Audley, and is believed to have studied at Buckingham College, Cambridge, now known as Magdalene College. He was educated for the law, entered the Inner Temple, was named town clerk of Colchester in 1514, and became Justice of the Peace for Essex in November 1520.

==Career in Parliament==
In 1523 Audley was returned to Parliament for Essex, and represented this constituency in subsequent Parliaments. In 1527 he was Groom of the Chamber, and became a member of Wolsey&#x27;s household. On the fall of the latter in 1529, he was made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the same year Speaker of the House of Commons, presiding over the famous assembly styled the Reformation Parliament, which abolished the papal jurisdiction. The same year he headed a deputation of the Commons to the king to complain of Bishop Fisher&#x27;s speech against their proceedings. He interpreted the King&#x27;s &quot;moral&quot; scruples to parliament concerning his marriage with Katherine of Aragon, and made himself the instrument of the King in the attack upon the clergy and the preparation of the Act of Supremacy.

In 1531 he had been made a serjeant-at-law and king&#x27;s serjeant; and on 20 May 1532 he was knighted, and succeeded Sir Thomas More as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, being appointed Lord Chancellor on 26 January 1533. He supported the king&#x27;s divorce from Katherine and the marriage with Anne Boleyn; and presided at the trials of Fisher and More in 1535, at which his conduct and evident intention to secure a conviction has been criticised by some. Next year he was part of the trial of Anne Boleyn and her &quot;lovers&quot; for treason and adultery. The execution of the king&#x27;s wife left him free to declare the king&#x27;s daughter Princess Elizabeth a bastard, and for Henry to marry Anne&#x27;s maid, Jane Seymour. Audley was a witness to the queen&#x27;s execution, and recommended to Parliament the new Act of Succession, which made Jane Seymour&#x27;s issue legitimate.

In 1537 he condemned to death as traitors the rebels of the Pilgrimage of Grace. On 29 November 1538 he was created Baron Audley of Walden; and soon afterwards presided as Lord Steward at the trials of Henry Pole, Lord Montacute, and of the Marquess of Exeter. In 1539, inclining to the Protestant Reformation, he made himself the King&#x27;s instrument in enforcing religious conformity, and in the passing of the Six Articles Act.

==Other activities==
On 24 April 1540 he was made a Knight of the Garter, and subsequently managed the attainder of Thomas Cromwell, and the dissolution of Henry&#x27;s marriage with Anne of Cleves. This was despite having previously been a strong ally of Cromwell. In 1542 he warmly supported the privileges of the Commons, but his conduct was inspired as usual by subservience to the court, which desired to secure a subsidy, and his opinion that the arrest was a flagrant contempt has been questioned by good authority.

He received several grants of monastic estates, including Holy Trinity Priory in Aldgate, London and Walden Abbey, Essex, where his grandson, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, built Audley End, doubtless named after him. In 1542 he endowed and re-established Buckingham College, Cambridge, under the new name of the College of St. Mary Magdalene (commonly Magdalene College), and ordained in the statutes that his heirs, &quot;the possessors of the late monastery of Walden&quot; should be Visitors of Magdalene College &quot;in perpetuum&quot;. The power to appoint the Master of the College was vested in the Visitor until an amendment to the College Statutes in 2012. The arms of Magdalene are derived from his.

A &quot;Booke of Orders for the Warre both by Sea and Land&quot; (Harleian MS. 297, 144) is attributed to his authorship.

==Marriages and progeny==

Lord Audley married twice:
*Firstly to Christina (or Margaret) Barnardiston, a daughter of Sir Thomas Barnardiston (died 1503), of Kedington, Suffolk;
*Secondly to Elizabeth Grey, third daughter of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, by whom he had two daughters, including:
**Margaret Audley, who married as her second husband Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, by whom her eldest son was Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, 1st Baron Howard de Walden, created Baron Howard de Walden in 1597 and Earl of Suffolk in 1603.

==Death and burial==
He resigned the great seal on 21 April 1544, and died on 30 April and was buried at Saffron Walden, where he had prepared for himself a splendid tomb. As he died without male progeny his barony became extinct at his death. One of his daughters, Margaret, married as her second husband Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Their elder son Lord Thomas Howard was created Baron Howard de Walden in 1597 and Earl of Suffolk in 1603. St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Berechurch in Essex has a monument to him in the Audley Chapel.

<text>The National Space Society (NSS) is an American international nonprofit 501(c)(3) educational and scientific organization specializing in space advocacy. It is a member of the Independent Charities of America and an annual participant in the Combined Federal Campaign. The society&#x27;s vision is: &quot;People living and working in thriving communities beyond the Earth, and the use of the vast resources of space for the dramatic betterment of humanity.&quot;

The society supports human spaceflight and robotic spaceflight, by both public (e.g., NASA, Russian Federal Space Agency and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and private sector (e.g., SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, etc.) organizations.

The major goals of the National Space Society are:

*Defending Earth: Protecting humanity from dangerous space objects (asteroid impact avoidance).
*Clean Energy from Space: Enabling everyone to benefit from space solar power.
*Developing Space: Making the vast resources of space available to all.
*Space Settlement: Moving civilization into space and making us an interplanetary species.

==History==
The society was established in the United States on March 28, 1987, by the merger of the National Space Institute, founded in 1974 by Wernher von Braun, and the L5 Society, founded in 1975 based on the concepts of Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill.

The society has an elected volunteer Board of Directors and a Board of Governors. The Board of Directors provides day-to-day operational oversight for the organization, and the Board of Governors provide strategic oversight and advisory to the Directors in the form of recommendations and guidance with respect to the broad strategies, overall policies, objectives, and goals of the Society. The Chairman of the Board of Governors is Karlton Johnson, USAF-Retired. In this capacity, he provides overall senior executive leadership to enhance the effectiveness and performance of the Board of Governors in support of the Society&#x27;s goals, imparts advice and guidance to the Board of Directors to enhance its conduct of business operations, and serves as the primary spokesperson for the Board of Governors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is Kirby Ikin. 

Karlton Johnson is currently the organization&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer. 

Serving the space community for nearly 50 years in its various forms, the National Space Society has remained a conduit for education, substantive dialogue, and impact player in the commercial and private space sector communities. The organization garnered the &quot;Five-Star Best in America&quot; award by the Independent Charities of America organization in 2005.

In 2014, the National Space Society launched the Enterprise In Space program in order to ignite interest in space and science, technology, engineering, art and math (STEAM) education.

In 2023, the National Space Society elected Isaac Arthur as President for a two-year term.

==&quot;Ad Astra&quot;==
The Society publishes a magazine , which appears quarterly in print and electronic form.

==International Space Development Conference==
The society hosts an annual International Space Development Conference (ISDC) held in major cities throughout the United States, often during or close to the Memorial Day weekend.

==NSS Chapters network==
As listed in each quarterly issue of , a large number of NSS chapters exist around the world. The chapters may serve a local area such as a school, city or town, or have a topical or special interest focus, such as a rocketry or astronomy club, or educational/community outreach program. Chapters are the peripheral organs of the society by organizing events, communicating with the public on the merits and benefits of space exploration, and working to educate political leaders.

===National Space Society of Australia===
A strong contingent of chapters is located in Australia. Prior to the NSI-L5 merger, the L5 Society had been developing chapters around the world, and in Australia, three chapters had been established. The &#x27;Southern Cross L5 Society&#x27; was formed in 1979, with groups in Sydney, Adelaide (in 1984) and Brisbane (in 1986). It was decided in late 1989 to create the &quot;National Space Society of Australia&quot; (NSSA) which could act as an umbrella organization

Similar efforts have taken hold in Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, as well as European countries that have a strong aerospace presence. These include France, Germany, and the Netherlands.

==Awards==
The society administers a number of awards. These are typically presented during the annual International Space Development Conference that NSS hosts. These awards are in recognition of individual volunteer effort, awards for NSS chapter work, the &quot;Space Pioneer&quot; award, and two significant awards which are presented in alternate years.

<doc id="317307" wikidata="Q2736244" url="?curid=317307" title="John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby">
<text>John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby (7 April 164824 February 1721) was an English poet and Tory politician of the late Stuart period who served as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. He was also known by his original title, Lord Mulgrave.
==Life==
John Sheffield was the only son of Edmund Sheffield, 2nd Earl of Mulgrave, and succeeded his father as 3rd Earl and 5th Baron Sheffield in 1658.

At the age of eighteen he joined the fleet, to serve in the Second Anglo-Dutch War; on the renewal of hostilities in 1672 he was present at the Battle of Sole Bay, and in the next year received the command of a ship. He was also made a colonel of infantry, and served for some time under Turenne. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1674. In 1680 he was put in charge of an expedition sent to relieve the Garrison of the town of Tangier, which was then under siege by Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif. It was said that he was provided with a rotten ship in the hope that he would not return, but the reason of this abortive plot, if plot there was, is not exactly ascertained. At court he took the side of the Duke of York and helped to bring about the Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s disgrace.

In 1682 he was dismissed from the court, apparently for putting himself forward as a suitor for the Princess Anne (who that year was aged 17 while Sheffield was 35 and himself not yet married), but on the accession of King James II, he received a seat in the Privy Council, and was made Lord Chamberlain. (He later married Catherine, the daughter of the king&#x27;s mistress, Catherine Sedley). He supported James in his most unpopular measures, and stayed with him in London during the time of his flight. He also protected the Spanish ambassador from the dangerous anger of the mob. He acquiesced, however, in the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;, and in 1694 was made Marquess of Normanby. In 1696 he refused in company with other Tory peers to sign an agreement to support William III as their &quot;rightful and lawful king&quot; against Jacobite attempts, and was consequently dismissed from the privy council. On the accession of Queen Anne, of whom he was a personal favourite, he was appointed Lord Privy Seal and Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1703 was created Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.

During the predominance of the Whigs between 1705 and 1710, Buckingham was deprived of his office as Lord Privy Seal, but in 1710 he was made Lord Steward, and in 1711 Lord President of the Council. After Queen Anne&#x27;s death he was not reappointed. He died on 24 February 1721 at his house in St. James&#x27;s Park, on the site of the present Buckingham Palace. Buckingham was succeeded by his son, Edmund (1716–1735), on whose death the titles became extinct.

==Literary works==
Buckingham was the author of &quot;An Account of the Revolution&quot; and some other essays, and of numerous poems, among them the &quot;Essay on Poetry&quot; and the &quot;Essay on Satire&quot;. It is probable that the &quot;Essay on Satire&quot;, which attacked many notable persons, &quot;sauntering Charles&quot; amongst others, was circulated in MS. It was often attributed at the time to Dryden, who accordingly suffered a thrashing at the hands of Lord Rochester&#x27;s bravoes for the reflections it contained upon the earl. Mulgrave was a patron of Dryden, who may possibly have revised it, but was certainly not responsible, although it is commonly printed with his works. Mulgrave adapted Shakespeare&#x27;s Julius Caesar, breaking it up into two plays, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Marcus Brutus&quot;. He introduced choruses between the acts, two of these being written by Alexander Pope, and an incongruous love scene between Brutus and Portia. He was a constant friend and patron of Pope, who expressed a flattering opinion of his &quot;Essay on Poetry&quot;. This, although smoothly enough written, deals chiefly with commonplaces.

In 1721 Edmund Curll published a pirated edition of his works, and was brought before the bar of the House of Lords for breach of privilege accordingly. An authorized edition under the superintendence of Pope appeared in 1723, but the authorities cut out the &quot;Account of the Revolution&quot; and &quot;The Feast of the Gods&quot; on account of their alleged Jacobite tendencies. These were printed at the Hague in 1727. Pope disingenuously repudiated any knowledge of the contents. Other editions reappeared in 1723, 1726, 1729, 1740 and 1753. His &quot;Poems&quot; were included in Johnson&#x27;s and other editions of the British poets.

==Family==
On 18 March 1685, in the chapel of Littlecote House, Ramsbury, Wiltshire, Buckingham married as his first wife Ursula Stawell, a daughter of George Stawell by his marriage to Ursula Austen. She died on 13 August 1697.

He married secondly Catherine Greville, a daughter of Fulke Greville, 5th Baron Brooke, and Sarah ( Dashwood), on 12 March 1698 in St Clement Danes, Westminster. She also died young, on 7 February 1703.

Buckingham married, thirdly, Lady Catherine Darnley (1680 – 13 March 1743), an illegitimate daughter of King James II and Catherine Sedley, on 16 March 1705 in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Covent Garden, London. They had three sons of whom Edmund survived, and succeeded him as 2nd Duke of Buckingham (he died unmarried on 30 October 1735, when all his titles became extinct).

Around 1706, Buckingham sired an illegitimate son, Charles with Frances Stewart, and, then or afterwards, wife of The Hon. Oliver Lambart, younger son of Charles Lambart, 3rd Earl of Cavan. Upon the death of his half-brother Edmund, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, Charles inherited the family estates and was the first of the Sheffield baronets.

<doc id="317308" wikidata="Q859369" url="?curid=317308" title="Comedy drama">
<text>Comedy drama (also known by the portmanteau dramedy) is a hybrid genre of works that combine elements of comedy and drama. In film, as well as scripted television series, serious dramatic subjects (such as death, illness, betrayal, grief, etc.) are handled with realism and subtlety, while preserving a humorous tenor.

The term &quot;dramedy&quot; began to be used in the television industry in the 1980s. Modern television comedy dramas tend to have more humour integrated into the story than the comic relief common in drama series, but usually contain a lower joke rate than sitcoms.

== History ==
In Greek theatre, plays were considered comedies or tragedies (i.e. drama): the former being light stories with a happy ending, and the latter serious stories with a sad ending. This concept even influenced Roman theatre and theatre of the Hellenistic period. Theatre of that era is thought to have long-lasting influence, even in modern narrative works. 

Even today, works are often classified into two broad categories: dramas and comedies. For instance, many awards that recognize achievements in film and television, such as the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards, segregate several awards into these two classifications.

The term &quot;dramedy&quot; is a translation from the French &quot;comédie dramatique&quot;.

The 20th century saw a rise in film and television works that could be described as comedy-dramas. In American cinema, &quot;The Kid&quot; (1921) by Charlie Chaplin is acknowledged as the first feature length film to blend comedy and drama.

== Characteristics ==
In January 2022, Rafael Abreu, writing for the StudioBinder filmmaking blog, defined this genre as follows:

Abreu also adds that dramedies often deal with relatable and serious topics such as divorce, illness, hardship, and heartache.

<doc id="317310" wikidata="Q2619683" url="?curid=317310" title="Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham">
<text>Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, 7th Earl of Winchilsea PC (2 July 16471 January 1730) was an English Tory politician and peer who supported the Hanoverian Succession in 1714. Known as Lord Nottingham until 1729, then as Lord Winchilsea.

==Origins==
He was born on 2 July 1647, the son of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham (1620-1682), Lord Chancellor of England, by his wife Elizabeth Harvey, a daughter of Daniel Harvey. His great grandmother was Elizabeth Finch, 1st Countess of Winchilsea.

One of his brothers was Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Aylesford.

==Education==
Little is known about his upbringing. He entered Westminster School in 1658, where he boarded for three years at the house of Dr. Richard Busby, the headmaster and his father&#x27;s former tutor at Christ Church, Oxford. Daniel also went to Christ Church and the excellence of his studies made his father doubt their authenticity. He matriculated at Christ Church as a Gentleman Commoner on 26 July 1662.

In April 1663, his father wrote to him, advising that he &quot;loose not the reputation which I am told you have gayn&#x27;d of diligence and sobriety&quot;. His father also advised him a month after he had arrived in Oxford &quot;to frequent the publique prayers, and study to reverence and defend, as well as to obey, the Church of England&quot; and when his first Easter away from home was approaching, he wrote, &quot;Nothing can make you truly wise but such a religion as dwells upon your heart and governs your whole life&quot;. However, Finch suffered from illness and it may be due to this that he left Oxford without graduating.

Finch went on his Grand Tour from 1665 to 1668, visiting Frankfurt, Munich, Venice, Florence, Naples, Rome and Paris. After he returned to England he was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society and his cousin Sir Roger Twysden wrote to Finch&#x27;s father that &quot;every body speaks him a very gentleman, and one you and your lady are likely to have much comfort in&quot;.

Later in 1689, he sold Nottingham House in Kensington to King William and Queen Mary for £20,000, the house was then expanded by Christopher Wren into Kensington Palace.

==Career==

Daniel Finch entered parliament for Lichfield in 1679. In 1682 he succeeded his father as Earl of Nottingham. He was one of the privy councillors who in 1685 signed the order for the proclamation of the Duke of York, but during the whole of the reign of James II, he kept away from the court. At the last moment, he hesitated to join in the invitation to William of Orange and after the flight of James II, he was the leader of the party who were in favour of James being King in name and William being regent.

He declined the office of Lord Chancellor under William and Mary, but accepted that of Secretary of State, retaining it until December 1693. Under Queen Anne in 1702, he again accepted the same office in the ministry of Lord Godolphin, but finally retired in 1704.

In 1711, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Tory ministry of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford was attempting to negotiate peace with France. On 7 December Finch moved the &#x27;No peace without Spain&#x27; amendment to the vote of thanks, which condemned any peace with France that left Spain and the West Indies in possession of a member of the House of Bourbon. Finch spoke for one hour and declared that &quot;though he had fourteen children, he would submit to live upon five hundred pounds a year rather than consent to those dark and unknown conditions of peace&quot;.

Nottingham built Burley House in Rutland, he was to a large extent his own architect and involved himself in the minutiae of its construction, before embarking on the project, Lord Nottingham consulted Sir Christopher Wren, but instead employed Henry Dormer (died 1727) just to supervise its building. It was completed in 1705, the main block stretches 200 feet long across 15 windows. He and his large family had moved in prior its completion.On the accession of King George I he was made Lord President of the Council but in 1716 he finally withdrew from office. On 9 September 1729, he succeeded to the title Earl of Winchilsea after his 2nd cousin John Finch, 6th Earl of Winchilsea died unmarried. Nottingham was reluctant to receive the superior title due to his own familial pride with the Nottingham title, so he combined the title (henceforth became united with his paternal title of Earl of Nottingham). He died on 1 January 1730 Burley.

==Marriages and issue==
He married twice:

*Firstly, on 16 June 1674, to Lady Essex Rich, a daughter of Robert Rich, 3rd Earl of Warwick by his wife Anne Cheeke. By his first wife he had 8 children of whom only one daughter survived to adulthood: 
**Lady Mary Finch (born 1677), who married firstly William Savile, 2nd Marquess of Halifax (as his second wife), and secondly John Ker, 1st Duke of Roxburghe. had issues including Dorothy Savile, Countess of Burlington.

*Secondly, on 29 December 1685,to Hon. Anne Hatton (1668–1743), a daughter of Christopher Hatton, 1st Viscount Hatton and Lady Cecilia Tufton, daughter of 2nd Earl of Thanet. She was appointed a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Mary II in 1691. By his second wife (who had over twenty pregnancies) he had at least twelve surviving children, including:

He later took the surname Finch-Hatton, his grandson was George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea and all future Earls of Winchilsea descended from this line.
**Lady Charlotte Finch (1693 (?1711)21 January 1773), who in 1725 became the second wife of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, and was the mother of Lady Charlotte and Lady Frances Seymour.
**Lady (Cecilia) Isabella Finch (1700–1771), who never married but became first Lady of the Bedchamber to Princess Amelia, a spinster aunt of King George III. In 1740 she commissioned William Kent to build her a magnificent townhouse at 44 Berkeley Square in Mayfair, London, which is famed for its theatrical staircase. It was purchased after her death by William Henry Fortescue, 1st Earl of Clermont (1722–1806), and served as his London townhouse. In the 20th century it was used as the Clermont Club.
**Lady Mary Finch (170130 May 1761) (not to be confused with her elder half-sister), who in 1716 married Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Marquess of Rockingham.
**Lady Henrietta Finch (170214 April 1742), who in 1723 married William Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Cleveland. No known descendants.
**Lady Elizabeth Finch (170410 April 1784), who married William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield. No descendants, but helped raised Dido Belle and Lady Elizabeth Murray.

==Assessment by Macaulay==

The Whig historian Lord Macaulay said of Lord Nottingham in 1848:
This son, Earl Daniel, was an honourable and virtuous man. Though enslaved by some absurd prejudices, and though liable to strange fits of caprice, he cannot be accused of having deviated from the path of right in search either of unlawful gain or of unlawful pleasure. Like his father he was a distinguished speaker, impressive, but prolix, and too monotonously solemn. The person of the orator was in perfect harmony with his oratory. His attitude was rigidly erect: his complexion so dark that he might have passed for a native of a warmer climate than ours; and his harsh features were composed to an expression resembling that of a chief mourner at a funeral. It was commonly said that he looked rather like a Spanish grandee than like an English gentleman. The nicknames of Dismal, Don Dismallo, and Don Diego, were fastened on him by jesters, and are not yet forgotten. He had paid much attention to the science by which his family had been raised to greatness, and was, for a man born to rank and wealth, wonderfully well read in the laws of his country. He was a devoted son of the Church, and showed his respect for her in two ways not usual among those Lords who in his time boasted that they were her especial friends, by writing tracts in defence of her dogmas, and by shaping his private life according to her precepts. Like other zealous churchmen, he had, till recently, been a strenuous supporter of monarchical authority. But to the policy which had been pursued since the suppression of the Western insurrection he was bitterly hostile, and not the less so because his younger brother Heneage had been turned out of the office of Solicitor General for refusing to defend the King&#x27;s dispensing power.

<doc id="317311" wikidata="Q14524818" url="?curid=317311" title="El Niño–Southern Oscillation">
<text>El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a global climate phenomenon that emerges from variations in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical Pacific Ocean. Those variations have an irregular pattern but do have some semblance of cycles. The occurrence of ENSO is not predictable. It affects the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics, and has links (teleconnections) to higher-latitude regions of the world. The warming phase of the sea surface temperature is known as &quot;El Niño&quot; and the cooling phase as &quot;La Niña&quot;. The Southern Oscillation is the accompanying atmospheric oscillation, which is coupled with the sea temperature change. 

El Niño is associated with higher than normal air sea level pressure over Indonesia, Australia and across the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. La Niña has roughly the reverse pattern: high pressure over the central and eastern Pacific and lower pressure through much of the rest of the tropics and subtropics. The two phenomena last a year or so each and typically occur every two to seven years with varying intensity, with neutral periods of lower intensity interspersed. El Niño events can be more intense but La Niña events may repeat and last longer. 

A key mechanism of ENSO is the Bjerknes feedback (named after Jacob Bjerknes in 1969) in which the atmospheric changes alter the sea temperatures that in turn alter the atmospheric winds in a positive feedback. Weaker easterly trade winds result in a surge of warm surface waters to the east and reduced ocean upwelling on the equator. In turn, this leads to warmer sea surface temperatures (called El Niño), a weaker Walker circulation (an east-west overturning circulation in the atmosphere) and even weaker trade winds. Ultimately the warm waters in the western tropical Pacific are depleted enough so that conditions return to normal. The exact mechanisms that cause the oscillation are unclear and are being studied. 
Each country that monitors the ENSO has a different threshold for what constitutes an El Niño or La Niña event, which is tailored to their specific interests.

El Niño and La Niña affect the global climate and disrupt normal weather patterns, which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others. El Niño events cause short-term (approximately 1 year in length) spikes in global average surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term surface cooling. Therefore, the relative frequency of El Niño compared to La Niña events can affect global temperature trends on timescales of around ten years. The countries most affected by ENSO are developing countries that are bordering the Pacific Ocean and are dependent on agriculture and fishing. 
In climate change science, ENSO is known as one of the internal climate variability phenomena. Future trends in ENSO due to climate change are uncertain, although climate change exacerbates the effects of droughts and floods. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report summarized the scientific knowledge in 2021 for the future of ENSO as follows: &quot;In the long term, it is very likely that the precipitation variance related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation will increase&quot;. The scientific consensus is also that &quot;it is very likely that rainfall variability related to changes in the strength and spatial extent of ENSO teleconnections will lead to significant changes at regional scale&quot;.

==Definition and terminology==

The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is a single climate phenomenon that periodically fluctuates between three phases: Neutral, La Niña or El Niño. La Niña and El Niño are opposite phases in the oscillation which are deemed to occur when specific ocean and atmospheric conditions are reached or exceeded. 

An early recorded mention of the term &quot;El Niño&quot; (&quot;The Boy&quot; in Spanish) to refer to climate occurred in 1892, when Captain Camilo Carrillo told the geographical society congress in Lima that Peruvian sailors named the warm south-flowing current &quot;El Niño&quot; because it was most noticeable around Christmas. Although pre-Columbian societies were certainly aware of the phenomenon, the indigenous names for it have been lost to history.

The capitalized term El Niño refers to the Christ Child, Jesus, because periodic warming in the Pacific near South America is usually noticed around Christmas. 

Originally, the term &quot;El Niño&quot; applied to an annual weak warm ocean current that ran southwards along the coast of Peru and Ecuador at about Christmas time. However, over time the term has evolved and now refers to the warm and negative phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The original phrase, &quot;El Niño de Navidad&quot;, arose centuries ago, when Peruvian fishermen named the weather phenomenon after the newborn Christ. 

La Niña (&quot;The Girl&quot; in Spanish) is the colder counterpart of El Niño, as part of the broader ENSO climate pattern. In the past, it was also called an anti-El Niño and El Viejo, meaning &quot;the old man.&quot;

A negative phase exists when atmospheric pressure over Indonesia and the west Pacific is abnormally high and pressure over the east Pacific is abnormally low, during El Niño episodes, and a positive phase is when the opposite occurs during La Niña episodes, and pressure over Indonesia is low and over the west Pacific is high.

==Fundamentals==
On average, the temperature of the ocean surface in the tropical East Pacific is roughly cooler than in the tropical West Pacific. The sea surface temperature (SST) of the West Pacific northeast of Australia averages around . SSTs in the East Pacific off the western coast of South America are closer to . Strong trade winds near the equator push water away from the East Pacific and towards the West Pacific. This water is slowly warmed by the Sun as it moves west along the equator. The ocean surface near Indonesia is typically around higher than near Peru because of the buildup of water in the West Pacific. The thermocline, or the transitional zone between the warmer waters near the ocean surface and the cooler waters of the deep ocean, is pushed downwards in the West Pacific due to this water accumulation. 

The total weight of a column of ocean water is almost the same in the western and east Pacific. Because the warmer waters of the upper ocean are slightly less dense than the cooler deep ocean, the thicker layer of warmer water in the western Pacific means the thermocline there must be deeper. The difference in weight must be enough to drive any deep water return flow. Consequently, the thermocline is tilted across the tropical Pacific, rising from an average depth of about in the West Pacific to a depth of about in the East Pacific.

Cooler deep ocean water takes the place of the outgoing surface waters in the East Pacific, rising to the ocean surface in a process called upwelling. Along the western coast of South America, water near the ocean surface is pushed westward due to the combination of the trade winds and the Coriolis effect. This process is known as Ekman transport. Colder water from deeper in the ocean rises along the continental margin to replace the near-surface water. This process cools the East Pacific because the thermocline is closer to the ocean surface, leaving relatively little separation between the deeper cold water and the ocean surface. Additionally, the northward-flowing Humboldt Current carries colder water from the Southern Ocean to the tropics in the East Pacific. The combination of the Humboldt Current and upwelling maintains an area of cooler ocean waters off the coast of Peru. The West Pacific lacks a cold ocean current and has less upwelling as the trade winds are usually weaker than in the East Pacific, allowing the West Pacific to reach warmer temperatures. These warmer waters provide energy for the upward movement of air. As a result, the warm West Pacific has on average more cloudiness and rainfall than the cool East Pacific.

ENSO describes a quasi-periodic change of both oceanic and atmospheric conditions over the tropical Pacific Ocean. These changes affect weather patterns across much of the Earth. The tropical Pacific is said to be in one of three states of ENSO (also called &quot;phases&quot;) depending on the atmospheric and oceanic conditions. When the tropical Pacific roughly reflects the average conditions, the state of ENSO is said to be in the &quot;neutral&quot; phase. However, the tropical Pacific experiences occasional shifts away from these average conditions. If trade winds are weaker than average, the effect of upwelling in the East Pacific and the flow of warmer ocean surface waters towards the West Pacific lessen. This results in a cooler West Pacific and a warmer East Pacific, leading to a shift of cloudiness and rainfall towards the East Pacific. This situation is called El Niño. The opposite occurs if trade winds are stronger than average, leading to a warmer West Pacific and a cooler East Pacific. This situation is called La Niña and is associated with increased cloudiness and rainfall over the West Pacific.

===Bjerknes feedback===
The close relationship between ocean temperatures and the strength of the trade winds was first identified by Jacob Bjerknes in 1969. Bjerknes also hypothesized that ENSO was a positive feedback system where the associated changes in one component of the climate system (the ocean or atmosphere) tend to reinforce changes in the other. For example, during El Niño, the reduced contrast in ocean temperatures across the Pacific results in weaker trade winds, further reinforcing the El Niño state. This process is known as &quot;Bjerknes feedback&quot;. Although these associated changes in the ocean and atmosphere often occur together, the state of the atmosphere may resemble a different ENSO phase than the state of the ocean or vice versa. Because their states are closely linked, the variations of ENSO may arise from changes in both the ocean and atmosphere and not necessarily from an initial change of exclusively one or the other. Conceptual models explaining how ENSO operates generally accept the Bjerknes feedback hypothesis. However, ENSO would perpetually remain in one phase if Bjerknes feedback were the only process occurring. Several theories have been proposed to explain how ENSO can change from one state to the next, despite the positive feedback. These explanations broadly fall under two categories. In one view, the Bjerknes feedback naturally triggers negative feedbacks that end and reverse the abnormal state of the tropical Pacific. This perspective implies that the processes that lead to El Niño and La Niña also eventually bring about their end, making ENSO a self-sustaining process. Other theories view the state of ENSO as being changed by irregular and external phenomena such as the Madden–Julian oscillation, tropical instability waves, and westerly wind bursts.

===Walker circulation===

The three phases of ENSO relate to the Walker circulation, which was named after Gilbert Walker who discovered the Southern Oscillation during the early twentieth century. The Walker circulation is an east-west overturning circulation in the vicinity of the equator in the Pacific. Upward air is associated with high sea temperatures, convection and rainfall, while the downward branch occurs over cooler sea surface temperatures in the east. During El Niño, as the sea surface temperatures change so does the Walker Circulation. Warming in the eastern tropical Pacific weakens or reverses the downward branch, while cooler conditions in the west lead to less rain and downward air, so the Walker Circulation first weakens and may reverse.]

=== Southern Oscillation ===
The Southern Oscillation is the atmospheric component of ENSO. This component is an oscillation in surface air pressure between the tropical eastern and the western Pacific Ocean waters. The strength of the Southern Oscillation is measured by the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The SOI is computed from fluctuations in the surface air pressure difference between Tahiti (in the Pacific) and Darwin, Australia (on the Indian Ocean).

El Niño episodes have negative SOI, meaning there is lower pressure over Tahiti and higher pressure in Darwin. La Niña episodes on the other hand have positive SOI, meaning there is higher pressure in Tahiti and lower in Darwin.

Low atmospheric pressure tends to occur over warm water and high pressure occurs over cold water, in part because of deep convection over the warm water. El Niño episodes are defined as sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, thus resulting in a decrease in the strength of the Pacific trade winds, and a reduction in rainfall over eastern and northern Australia. La Niña episodes are defined as sustained cooling of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, thus resulting in an increase in the strength of the Pacific trade winds, and the opposite effects in Australia when compared to El Niño.

Although the Southern Oscillation Index has a long station record going back to the 1800s, its reliability is limited due to the latitudes of both Darwin and Tahiti being well south of the Equator, so that the surface air pressure at both locations is less directly related to ENSO. To overcome this effect, a new index was created, named the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (EQSOI). To generate this index, two new regions, centered on the Equator, were defined. The western region is located over Indonesia and the eastern one over the equatorial Pacific, close to the South American coast. However, data on EQSOI goes back only to 1949.

Sea surface height (SSH) changes up or down by several centimeters in Pacific equatorial region with the ESNO: El Niño causes a positive SSH anomaly (raised sea level) because of thermal expansion while La Niña causes a negative SSH anomaly (lowered sea level) via contraction.

== Three phases of sea surface temperature ==
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is a single climate phenomenon that quasi-periodically fluctuates between three phases: Neutral, La Niña or El Niño. La Niña and El Niño are opposite phases which require certain changes to take place in both the ocean and the atmosphere before an event is declared. The cool phase of ENSO is La Niña, with SST in the eastern Pacific below average, and air pressure high in the eastern Pacific and low in the western Pacific. The ENSO cycle, including both El Niño and La Niña, causes global changes in temperature and rainfall.

=== Neutral phase ===
If the temperature variation from climatology is within 0.5 °C (0.9 °F), ENSO conditions are described as neutral. Neutral conditions are the transition between warm and cold phases of ENSO. Sea surface temperatures (by definition), tropical precipitation, and wind patterns are near average conditions during this phase. Close to half of all years are within neutral periods. During the neutral ENSO phase, other climate anomalies/patterns such as the sign of the North Atlantic Oscillation or the Pacific–North American teleconnection pattern exert more influence.

=== El Niño phase ===

El Niño conditions are established when the Walker circulation weakens or reverses and the Hadley circulation strengthens, leading to the development of a band of warm ocean water in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific (approximately between the International Date Line and 120°W), including the area off the west coast of South America, as upwelling of cold water occurs less or not at all offshore. 

This warming causes a shift in the atmospheric circulation, leading to higher air pressure in the western Pacific and lower in the eastern Pacific, with rainfall reducing over Indonesia, India and northern Australia, while rainfall and tropical cyclone formation increases over the tropical Pacific Ocean. The low-level surface trade winds, which normally blow from east to west along the equator, either weaken or start blowing from the other direction.

El Niño phases are known to happen at irregular intervals of two to seven years, and lasts nine months to two years. The average period length is five years. When this warming occurs for seven to nine months, it is classified as El Niño &quot;conditions&quot;; when its duration is longer, it is classified as an El Niño &quot;episode&quot;. 

It is thought that there have been at least 30 El Niño events between 1900 and 2024, with the 1982–83, 1997–98 and 2014–16 events among the strongest on record. Since 2000, El Niño events have been observed in 2002–03, 2004–05, 2006–07, 2009–10, 2014–16, 2018–19, and 2023–24.

Major ENSO events were recorded in the years 1790–93, 1828, 1876–78, 1891, 1925–26, 1972–73, 1982–83, 1997–98, 2014–16, and 2023–24. During strong El Niño episodes, a secondary peak in sea surface temperature across the far eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean sometimes follows the initial peak.

=== La Niña phase ===
An especially strong Walker circulation causes La Niña, which is considered to be the cold oceanic and positive atmospheric phase of the broader El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) weather phenomenon, as well as the opposite of weather pattern, where sea surface temperature across the eastern equatorial part of the central Pacific Ocean will be lower than normal by 3–5 °C (5.4–9 °F). The phenomenon occurs as strong winds blow warm water at the ocean&#x27;s surface away from South America, across the Pacific Ocean towards Indonesia. As this warm water moves west, cold water from the deep sea rises to the surface near South America. 

The movement of so much heat across a quarter of the planet, and particularly in the form of temperature at the ocean surface, can have a significant effect on weather across the entire planet. Tropical instability waves visible on sea surface temperature maps, showing a tongue of colder water, are often present during neutral or La Niña conditions.

La Niña is a complex weather pattern that occurs every few years, often persisting for longer than five months. El Niño and La Niña can be indicators of weather changes across the globe. Atlantic and Pacific hurricanes can have different characteristics due to lower or higher wind shear and cooler or warmer sea surface temperatures.

A timeline of all La Niña episodes between 1900 and 2023. Note that each forecast agency has a different criteria for what constitutes a La Niña event, which is tailored to their specific interests.
La Niña events have been observed for hundreds of years, and occurred on a regular basis during the early parts of both the 17th and 19th centuries. Since the start of the 20th century, La Niña events have occurred during the following years:


=== Transitional phases ===
Transitional phases at the onset or departure of El Niño or La Niña can also be important factors on global weather by affecting teleconnections. Significant episodes, known as Trans-Niño, are measured by the Trans-Niño index (TNI). Examples of affected short-time climate in North America include precipitation in the Northwest US and intense tornado activity in the contiguous US.

==Variations==

===ENSO Modoki===

The first ENSO pattern to be recognised, called Eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO, to distinguish if from others, involves temperature anomalies in the eastern Pacific. However, in the 1990s and 2000s, variations of ENSO conditions were observed, in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly (Niño 1 and 2) is not affected, but an anomaly also arises in the central Pacific (Niño 3.4). The phenomenon is called Central Pacific (CP) ENSO, &quot;dateline&quot; ENSO (because the anomaly arises near the dateline), or ENSO &quot;Modoki&quot; (Modoki is Japanese for &quot;similar, but different&quot;). There are variations of ENSO additional to the EP and CP types, and some scientists argue that ENSO exists as a continuum, often with hybrid types.

The effects of the CP ENSO are different from those of the EP ENSO. The El Niño Modoki is associated with more hurricanes more frequently making landfall in the Atlantic. La Niña Modoki leads to a rainfall increase over northwestern Australia and northern Murray–Darling basin, rather than over the eastern portion of the country as in a conventional EP La Niña. Also, La Niña Modoki increases the frequency of cyclonic storms over Bay of Bengal, but decreases the occurrence of severe storms in the Indian Ocean overall.

The first recorded El Niño that originated in the central Pacific and moved toward the east was in 1986. Recent Central Pacific El Niños happened in 1986–87, 1991–92, 1994–95, 2002–03, 2004–05 and 2009–10. Furthermore, there were &quot;Modoki&quot; events in 1957–59, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1968–70, 1977–78 and 1979–80. Some sources say that the El Niños of 2006-07 and 2014-16 were also Central Pacific El Niños. Recent years when La Niña Modoki events occurred include 1973–1974, 1975–1976, 1983–1984, 1988–1989, 1998–1999, 2000–2001, 2008–2009, 2010–2011, and 2016–2017.

The recent discovery of ENSO Modoki has some scientists believing it to be linked to global warming. However, comprehensive satellite data go back only to 1979. More research must be done to find the correlation and study past El Niño episodes. More generally, there is no scientific consensus on how/if climate change might affect ENSO.

There is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this &quot;new&quot; ENSO. A number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence, or both, either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction, finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches, or that other types should be distinguished, such as standard and extreme ENSO. 

Likewise, following the asymmetric nature of the warm and cold phases of ENSO, some studies could not identify similar variations for La Niña, both in observations and in the climate models, but some sources could identify variations on La Niña with cooler waters on central Pacific and average or warmer water temperatures on both eastern and western Pacific, also showing eastern Pacific Ocean currents going to the opposite direction compared to the currents in traditional La Niñas.

===ENSO Costero===
Coined by the Peruvian (ENFEN), ENSO Costero, or ENSO Oriental, is the name given to the phenomenon where the sea-surface temperature anomalies are mostly focused on the South American coastline, especially from Peru and Ecuador. Studies point many factors that can lead to its occurrence, sometimes accompanying, or being accompanied, by a larger EP ENSO occurrence, or even displaying opposite conditions from the observed ones in the other Niño regions when accompanied by Modoki variations.

ENSO Costero events usually present more localized effects, with warm phases leading to increased rainfall over the coast of Ecuador, northern Peru and the Amazon rainforest, and increased temperatures over the northern Chilean coast, and cold phases leading to droughts on the peruvian coast, and increased rainfall and decreased temperatures on its mountainous and jungle regions.

Because they don&#x27;t influence the global climate as much as the other types, these events present lesser and weaker correlations to other significant ENSO features, neither always being triggered by Kelvin waves, nor always being accompanied by proportional Southern Oscillation responses. According to the Coastal Niño Index (ICEN), strong El Niño Costero events include 1957, 1982–83, 1997–98 and 2015–16, and La Niña Costera ones include 1950, 1954–56, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1967–68, 1970–71, 1975–76 and 2013.

== Monitoring and declaration of conditions ==
Currently, each country has a different threshold for what constitutes an El Niño event, which is tailored to their specific interests, for example: 

* In the United States, an El Niño is declared when the Climate Prediction Center, which monitors the sea surface temperatures in the &quot;Niño 3.4 region&quot; and the tropical Pacific, forecasts that the sea surface temperature will be above average or more for the next several seasons. The &quot;Niño 3.4 region&quot; stretches from the 120th to 170th meridians west longitude astride the equator five degrees of latitude on either side, are monitored. It is approximately to the southeast of Hawaii. The most recent three-month average for the area is computed, and if the region is more than 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) above (or below) normal for that period, then an El Niño (or La Niña) is considered in progress.
* The Australian Bureau of Meteorology looks at the trade winds, Southern Oscillation Index, weather models and sea surface temperatures in the Niño 3 and 3.4 regions, before declaring an ENSO event. 
* The Japan Meteorological Agency declares that an ENSO event has started when the average five month sea surface temperature deviation for the Niño 3 region is over for six consecutive months or longer. 
* The Peruvian government declares that an ENSO Costero is under way if the sea surface temperature deviation in the Niño 1+2 regions equal or exceed for at least three months.
* The United Kingdom&#x27;s Met Office also uses a several month period to determine ENSO state. When this warming or cooling occurs for only seven to nine months, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña &quot;conditions&quot;; when it occurs for more than that period, it is classified as El Niño/La Niña &quot;episodes&quot;.

== Effects of ENSO on global climate ==

In climate change science, ENSO is known as one of the internal climate variability phenomena. The other two main ones are Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. 

La Niña impacts the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns, which can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others. El Niño events cause short-term (approximately 1 year in length) spikes in global average surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling. Therefore, the relative frequency of El Niño compared to La Niña events can affect global temperature trends on decadal timescales. 

=== Climate change ===
There is no sign that there are actual changes in the ENSO physical phenomenon due to climate change. Climate models do not simulate ENSO well enough to make reliable predictions. Future trends in ENSO are uncertain as different models make different predictions. It may be that the observed phenomenon of more frequent and stronger El Niño events occurs only in the initial phase of the global warming, and then (e.g., after the lower layers of the ocean get warmer, as well), El Niño will become weaker. It may also be that the stabilizing and destabilizing forces influencing the phenomenon will eventually compensate for each other. 

The consequences of ENSO in terms of the temperature anomalies and precipitation and weather extremes around the world are clearly increasing and associated with climate change. For example, recent scholarship (since about 2019) has found that climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme El Niño events. Previously there was no consensus on whether climate change will have any influence on the strength or duration of El Niño events, as research alternately supported El Niño events becoming stronger and weaker, longer and shorter. 

Over the last several decades, the number of El Niño events increased, and the number of La Niña events decreased, although observation of ENSO for much longer is needed to detect robust changes.

Studies of historical data show the recent El Niño variation is most likely linked to global warming. For example, some results, even after subtracting the positive influence of decadal variation, are shown to be possibly present in the ENSO trend, the amplitude of the ENSO variability in the observed data still increases, by as much as 60% in the last 50 years. A study published in 2023 by CSIRO researchers found that climate change may have increased by two times the likelihood of strong El Niño events and nine times the likelihood of strong La Niña events. The study stated it found a consensus between different models and experiments.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report summarized the state of the art of research in 2021 into the future of ENSO as follows: 

* &quot;In the long term, it is very likely that the precipitation variance related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation will increase&quot; and 
* &quot;It is very likely that rainfall variability related to changes in the strength and spatial extent of ENSO teleconnections will lead to significant changes at regional scale&quot;. and 
* &quot;There is medium confidence that both ENSO amplitude and the frequency of high-magnitude events since 1950 are higher than over the period from 1850 and possibly as far back as 1400&quot;.

===Investigations regarding tipping points===
The ENSO is considered to be a potential tipping element in Earth&#x27;s climate. Global warming can strengthen the ENSO teleconnection and resulting extreme weather events. For example, an increase in the frequency and magnitude of El Niño events have triggered warmer than usual temperatures over the Indian Ocean, by modulating the Walker circulation. This has resulted in a rapid warming of the Indian Ocean, and consequently a weakening of the Asian Monsoon.

== Effects of ENSO on weather patterns ==
El Niño affects the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns, which can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIWA El Niño/La Niña&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tropical cyclones ===
Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years. During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago.

Based on modeled and observed accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), El Niño years usually result in less active hurricane seasons in the Atlantic Ocean, but instead favor a shift to tropical cyclone activity in the Pacific Ocean, compared to La Niña years favoring above average hurricane development in the Atlantic and less so in the Pacific basin.

Over the Atlantic Ocean, vertical wind shear is increased, which inhibits tropical cyclone genesis and intensification, by causing the westerly winds to be stronger. The atmosphere over the Atlantic Ocean can also be drier and more stable during El Niño events, which can inhibit tropical cyclone genesis and intensification. Within the Eastern Pacific basin: El Niño events contribute to decreased easterly vertical wind shear and favor above-normal hurricane activity. However, the impacts of the ENSO state in this region can vary and are strongly influenced by background climate patterns. The Western Pacific basin experiences a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form during El Niño events, with tropical cyclone formation shifting eastward, without a major change in how many develop each year. As a result of this change, Micronesia is more likely, and China less likely, to be affected by tropical cyclones. A change in the location of where tropical cyclones form also occurs within the Southern Pacific Ocean between 135°E and 120°W, with tropical cyclones more likely to occur within the Southern Pacific basin than the Australian region. As a result of this change tropical cyclones are 50% less likely to make landfall on Queensland, while the risk of a tropical cyclone is elevated for island nations like Niue, French Polynesia, Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Cook Islands.

=== Remote influence on tropical Atlantic Ocean ===
A study of climate records has shown that El Niño events in the equatorial Pacific are generally associated with a warm tropical North Atlantic in the following spring and summer. About half of El Niño events persist sufficiently into the spring months for the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool to become unusually large in summer. Occasionally, El Niño&#x27;s effect on the Atlantic Walker circulation over South America strengthens the easterly trade winds in the western equatorial Atlantic region. As a result, an unusual cooling may occur in the eastern equatorial Atlantic in spring and summer following El Niño peaks in winter. Cases of El Niño-type events in both oceans simultaneously have been linked to severe famines related to the extended failure of monsoon rains.

==Impacts on humans and ecosystems==
=== Economic impacts ===

When El Niño conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in easterly trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water, and its economic effect on local fishing for an international market can be serious. Developing countries that depend on their own agriculture and fishing, particularly those bordering the Pacific Ocean, are usually most affected by El Niño conditions. In this phase of the Oscillation, the pool of warm water in the Pacific near South America is often at its warmest in late December. 

More generally, El Niño can affect commodity prices and the macroeconomy of different countries. It can constrain the supply of rain-driven agricultural commodities; reduce agricultural output, construction, and services activities; increase food prices; and may trigger social unrest in commodity-dependent poor countries that primarily rely on imported food. A University of Cambridge Working Paper shows that while Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an El Niño shock, other countries may actually benefit from an El Niño weather shock (either directly or indirectly through positive spillovers from major trading partners), for instance, Argentina, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Furthermore, most countries experience short-run inflationary pressures following an El Niño shock, while global energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase. The IMF estimates a significant El Niño can boost the GDP of the United States by about 0.5% (due largely to lower heating bills) and reduce the GDP of Indonesia by about 1.0%.

=== Health and social impacts ===
Extreme weather conditions related to the El Niño cycle correlate with changes in the incidence of epidemic diseases. For example, the El Niño cycle is associated with increased risks of some of the diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria, dengue fever, and Rift Valley fever. Cycles of malaria in India, Venezuela, Brazil, and Colombia have now been linked to El Niño. Outbreaks of another mosquito-transmitted disease, Australian encephalitis (Murray Valley encephalitis—MVE), occur in temperate south-east Australia after heavy rainfall and flooding, which are associated with La Niña events. A severe outbreak of Rift Valley fever occurred after extreme rainfall in north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia during the 1997–98 El Niño.

ENSO conditions have also been related to Kawasaki disease incidence in Japan and the west coast of the United States, via the linkage to tropospheric winds across the north Pacific Ocean.

ENSO may be linked to civil conflicts. Scientists at The Earth Institute of Columbia University, having analyzed data from 1950 to 2004, suggest ENSO may have had a role in 21% of all civil conflicts since 1950, with the risk of annual civil conflict doubling from 3% to 6% in countries affected by ENSO during El Niño years relative to La Niña years.

=== Ecological consequences ===
During the 1982–83, 1997–98 and 2015–16 ENSO events, large extensions of tropical forests experienced a prolonged dry period that resulted in widespread fires, and drastic changes in forest structure and tree species composition in Amazonian and Bornean forests. Their impacts do not restrict only vegetation, since declines in insect populations were observed after extreme drought and terrible fires during El Niño 2015–16. Declines in habitat-specialist and disturbance-sensitive bird species and in large-frugivorous mammals were also observed in Amazonian burned forests, while temporary extirpation of more than 100 lowland butterfly species occurred at a burned forest site in Borneo.

In seasonally dry tropical forests, which are more drought tolerant, researchers found that El Niño induced drought increased seedling mortality. In a research published in October 2022, researchers studied seasonally dry tropical forests in a national park in Chiang Mai in Thailand for 7 years and observed that El Niño increased seedling mortality even in seasonally dry tropical forests and may impact entire forests in long run.

==== Coral bleaching ====
Following the El Nino event in 1997 – 1998, the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory attributes the first large-scale coral bleaching event to the warming waters.

Most critically, global mass bleaching events were recorded in 1997-98 and 2015–16, when around 75-99% losses of live coral were registered across the world. Considerable attention was also given to the collapse of Peruvian and Chilean anchovy populations that led to a severe fishery crisis following the ENSO events in 1972–73, 1982–83, 1997–98 and, more recently, in 2015–16. In particular, increased surface seawater temperatures in 1982-83 also lead to the probable extinction of two hydrocoral species in Panamá, and to a massive mortality of kelp beds along 600 km of coastline in Chile, from which kelps and associated biodiversity slowly recovered in the most affected areas even after 20 years. All these findings enlarge the role of ENSO events as a strong climatic force driving ecological changes all around the world – particularly in tropical forests and coral reefs.

== Impacts by region ==
Observations of ENSO events since 1950 show that impacts associated with such events depend on the time of year. While certain events and impacts are expected to occur, it is not certain that they will happen. The impacts that generally do occur during most El Niño events include below-average rainfall over Indonesia and northern South America, and above average rainfall in southeastern South America, eastern equatorial Africa, and the southern United States.

=== Africa ===

La Niña results in wetter-than-normal conditions in southern Africa from December to February, and drier-than-normal conditions over equatorial east Africa over the same period.

The effects of El Niño on rainfall in southern Africa differ between the summer and winter rainfall areas. Winter rainfall areas tend to get higher rainfall than normal and summer rainfall areas tend to get less rain. The effect on the summer rainfall areas is stronger and has led to severe drought in strong El Niño events.

Sea surface temperatures off the west and south coasts of South Africa are affected by ENSO via changes in surface wind strength. During El Niño the south-easterly winds driving upwelling are weaker which results in warmer coastal waters than normal, while during La Niña the same winds are stronger and cause colder coastal waters. These effects on the winds are part of large scale influences on the tropical Atlantic and the South Atlantic High-pressure system, and changes to the pattern of westerly winds further south. There are other influences not known to be related to ENSO of similar importance. Some ENSO events do not lead to the expected changes.

=== Antarctica ===
Many ENSO linkages exist in the high southern latitudes around Antarctica. Specifically, El Niño conditions result in high-pressure anomalies over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, causing reduced sea ice and increased poleward heat fluxes in these sectors, as well as the Ross Sea. The Weddell Sea, conversely, tends to become colder with more sea ice during El Niño. The exact opposite heating and atmospheric pressure anomalies occur during La Niña. This pattern of variability is known as the Antarctic dipole mode, although the Antarctic response to ENSO forcing is not ubiquitous.

=== Asia ===
In Western Asia, during the region&#x27;s November–April rainy season, there is increased precipitation in the El Niño phase and reduced precipitation in the La Niña phase on average.

During El Niño years: As warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific, it takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the western Pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific. Singapore experienced the driest February in 2010 since records began in 1869, with only 6.3 mm of rain falling in the month. The years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest Februaries, when 8.4 mm of rain fell.

During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, along with the subtropical ridge position, shifts westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat in China. In March 2008, La Niña caused a drop in sea surface temperatures over Southeast Asia by . It also caused heavy rains over the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

=== Australia ===
Across most of the continent, El Niño and La Niña have more impact on climate variability than any other factor. There is a strong correlation between the strength of La Niña and rainfall: the greater the sea surface temperature and Southern Oscillation difference from normal, the larger the rainfall change.

During El Niño events, the shift in rainfall away from the Western Pacific may mean that rainfall across Australia is reduced. Over the southern part of the continent, warmer than average temperatures can be recorded as weather systems are more mobile and fewer blocking areas of high pressure occur. The onset of the Indo-Australian Monsoon in tropical Australia is delayed by two to six weeks, which as a consequence means that rainfall is reduced over the northern tropics. The risk of a significant bushfire season in south-eastern Australia is higher following an El Niño event, especially when it is combined with a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event. 

=== Europe ===
El Niño&#x27;s effects on Europe are controversial, complex and difficult to analyze, as it is one of several factors that influence the weather over the continent and other factors can overwhelm the signal.

=== North America ===

La Niña causes mostly the opposite effects of El Niño: above-average precipitation across the northern Midwest, the northern Rockies, Northern California, and the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s southern and eastern regions. Meanwhile, precipitation in the southwestern and southeastern states, as well as southern California, is below average. This also allows for the development of many stronger-than-average hurricanes in the Atlantic and fewer in the Pacific.

ENSO is linked to rainfall over Puerto Rico. During an El Niño, snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well-below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. During a La Niña, snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. 

In Canada, La Niña will, in general, cause a cooler, snowier winter, such as the near-record-breaking amounts of snow recorded in the La Niña winter of 2007–2008 in eastern Canada.

In the spring of 2022, La Niña caused above-average precipitation and below-average temperatures in the state of Oregon. April was one of the wettest months on record, and La Niña effects, while less severe, were expected to continue into the summer.

Over North America, the main temperature and precipitation impacts of El Niño generally occur in the six months between October and March. In particular, the majority of Canada generally has milder than normal winters and springs, with the exception of eastern Canada where no significant impacts occur. Within the United States, the impacts generally observed during the six-month period include wetter-than-average conditions along the Gulf Coast between Texas and Florida, while drier conditions are observed in Hawaii, the Ohio Valley, Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains.

Study of more recent weather events over California and the southwestern United States indicate that there is a variable relationship between El Niño and above-average precipitation, as it strongly depends on the strength of the El Niño event and other factors. Though it has been historically associated with high rainfall in California, the effects of El Niño depend more strongly on the &quot;flavor&quot; of El Niño than its presence or absence, as only &quot;persistent El Niño&quot; events lead to consistently high rainfall.

To the north across Alaska, La Niña events lead to drier than normal conditions, while El Niño events do not have a correlation towards dry or wet conditions. During El Niño events, increased precipitation is expected in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During La Niña, increased precipitation is diverted into the Pacific Northwest due to a more northerly storm track. During La Niña events, the storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal winter conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. During the El Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream.

==== Isthmus of Tehuantepec ====
The synoptic condition for the Tehuantepecer, a violent mountain-gap wind in between the mountains of Mexico and Guatemala, is associated with high-pressure system forming in Sierra Madre of Mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front, which causes winds to accelerate through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts, between October and February, with a summer maximum in July caused by the westward extension of the Azores-Bermuda high pressure system. Wind magnitude is greater during El Niño years than during La Niña years, due to the more frequent cold frontal incursions during El Niño winters. Tehuantepec winds reach to , and on rare occasions . The wind&#x27;s direction is from the north to north-northeast. It leads to a localized acceleration of the trade winds in the region, and can enhance thunderstorm activity when it interacts with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The effects can last from a few hours to six days. Between 1942 and 1957, La Niña had an impact that caused isotope changes in the plants of Baja California, and that had helped scientists to study his impact.

=== Pacific islands ===
During an El Niño event, New Zealand tends to experience stronger or more frequent westerly winds during their summer, which leads to an elevated risk of drier than normal conditions along the east coast. There is more rain than usual though on New Zealand&#x27;s West Coast, because of the barrier effect of the North Island mountain ranges and the Southern Alps.

Fiji generally experiences drier than normal conditions during an El Niño, which can lead to drought becoming established over the Islands. However, the main impacts on the island nation is felt about a year after the event becomes established. Within the Samoan Islands, below average rainfall and higher than normal temperatures are recorded during El Niño events, which can lead to droughts and forest fires on the islands. Other impacts include a decrease in the sea level, possibility of coral bleaching in the marine environment and an increased risk of a tropical cyclone affecting Samoa.

In the late winter and spring during El Niño events, drier than average conditions can be expected in Hawaii. On Guam during El Niño years, dry season precipitation averages below normal, but the probability of a tropical cyclone is more than triple what is normal, so extreme short duration rainfall events are possible. On American Samoa during El Niño events, precipitation averages about 10 percent above normal, while La Niña events are associated with precipitation averaging about 10 percent below normal.

=== South America ===
The effects of El Niño in South America are direct and strong. An El Niño is associated with warm and very wet weather months in April–October along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador, causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme. 

Because El Niño&#x27;s warm pool feeds thunderstorms above, it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean, including several portions of the South American west coast. The effects of El Niño in South America are direct and stronger than in North America. An El Niño is associated with warm and very wet weather months in April–October along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador, causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme. The effects during the months of February, March, and April may become critical along the west coast of South America, El Niño reduces the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water that sustains large fish populations, which in turn sustain abundant sea birds, whose droppings support the fertilizer industry. The reduction in upwelling leads to fish kills off the shore of Peru.

The local fishing industry along the affected coastline can suffer during long-lasting El Niño events. Peruvian fisheries collapsed during the 1970s due to overfishing following the 1972 El Niño Peruvian anchoveta reduction. The fisheries were previously the world&#x27;s largest, however, this collapse led to the decline of these fisheries. During the 1982–83 event, jack mackerel and anchoveta populations were reduced, scallops increased in warmer water, but hake followed cooler water down the continental slope, while shrimp and sardines moved southward, so some catches decreased while others increased. Horse mackerel have increased in the region during warm events. Shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions create challenges for the fishing industry. Peruvian sardines have moved during El Niño events to Chilean areas. Other conditions provide further complications, such as the government of Chile in 1991 creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self-employed fishermen and industrial fleets.

Southern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions during El Niño years, but mainly during the spring and early summer. Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events. Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia, and Central America.

During a time of La Niña, drought affects the coastal regions of Peru and Chile. From December to February, northern Brazil is wetter than normal. La Niña causes higher than normal rainfall in the central Andes, which in turn causes catastrophic flooding on the Llanos de Mojos of Beni Department, Bolivia. Such flooding is documented from 1853, 1865, 1872, 1873, 1886, 1895, 1896, 1907, 1921, 1928, 1929 and 1931.

==== Galápagos Islands ====
The Galápagos Islands are a chain of volcanic islands, nearly 600 miles west of Ecuador, South America. in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. These islands support a wide diversity of terrestrial and marine species. The ecosystem is based on the normal trade winds which influence upwelling of cold, nutrient rich waters to the islands. During an El Niño event the trade winds weaken and sometimes blow from west to east, which causes the Equatorial current to weaken, raising surface water temperatures and decreasing nutrients in waters surrounding the Galápagos. El Niño causes a trophic cascade which impacts entire ecosystems starting with primary producers and ending with critical animals such as sharks, penguins, and seals. The effects of El Niño can become detrimental to populations that often starve and die back during these years. Rapid evolutionary adaptations are displayed amongst animal groups during El Niño years to mitigate El Niño conditions.

== History ==
=== In geologic timescales ===
Evidence is also strong for El Niño events during the early Holocene epoch 10,000 years ago.
Different modes of ENSO-like events have been registered in paleoclimatic archives, showing different triggering methods, feedbacks and environmental responses to the geological, atmospheric and oceanographic characteristics of the time. These paleorecords can be used to provide a qualitative basis for conservation practices.

Scientists have also found chemical signatures of warmer sea surface temperatures and increased rainfall caused by El Niño in coral specimens that are around 13,000 years old.

In a paleoclimate study published in 2024, the authors suggest that El Niños had a strong influence on Earth&#x27;s hothouse climate during the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The increasing intensity and duration of El Niño events were associated with active volcanism, which resulted in the dieback of vegetation, an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a significant warming and disturbances in the circulation of air masses.


=== During human history ===

ENSO conditions have occurred at two- to seven-year intervals for at least the past 300 years, but most of them have been weak. 

El Niño may have led to the demise of the Moche and other pre-Columbian Peruvian cultures. A recent study suggests a strong El Niño effect between 1789 and 1793 caused poor crop yields in Europe, which in turn helped touch off the French Revolution. The extreme weather produced by El Niño in 1876–77 gave rise to the most deadly famines of the 19th century. The 1876 famine alone in northern China killed up to 13 million people.

The phenomenon had long been of interest because of its effects on the guano industry and other enterprises that depend on biological productivity of the sea. It is recorded that as early as 1822, cartographer Joseph Lartigue, of the French frigate &quot;La Clorinde&quot; under Baron Mackau, noted the &quot;counter-current&quot; and its usefulness for traveling southward along the Peruvian coast.

Charles Todd, in 1888, suggested droughts in India and Australia tended to occur at the same time; Norman Lockyer noted the same in 1904. An El Niño connection with flooding was reported in 1894 by Victor Eguiguren (1852–1919) and in 1895 by Federico Alfonso Pezet (1859–1929). In 1924, Gilbert Walker (for whom the Walker circulation is named) coined the term &quot;Southern Oscillation&quot;. He and others (including Norwegian-American meteorologist Jacob Bjerknes) are generally credited with identifying the El Niño effect.

The major 1982–83 El Niño led to an upsurge of interest from the scientific community. The period 1990–95 was unusual in that El Niños have rarely occurred in such rapid succession. An especially intense El Niño event in 1998 caused an estimated 16% of the world&#x27;s reef systems to die. The event temporarily warmed air temperature by 1.5 °C, compared to the usual increase of 0.25 °C associated with El Niño events. Since then, mass coral bleaching has become common worldwide, with all regions having suffered &quot;severe bleaching&quot;.

Around 1525, when Francisco Pizarro made landfall in Peru, he noted rainfall in the deserts, the first written record of the impacts of El Niño.

<text>Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, ( 16655 March 1726) was an English aristocrat.

He was born at West Dean, Wiltshire, the third son of Robert Pierrepont of Thoresby, Nottinghamshire (son of William Pierrepont ), and his wife Elizabeth Evelyn (daughter of John Evelyn ). His older brothers were the 3rd Earl and 4th Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull, who both died childless.

He was educated at Winchester College, and entered Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1683.

==Political career==

He was elected member of parliament for East Retford in 1689, before his accession to the peerage as 5th Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull on the death of his brother in 1690. While serving as one of the commissioners for the union with Scotland, he was created Marquess of Dorchester in 1706, and took a leading part in the business of the House of Lords. He was made a privy councillor and in 1715 was created Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull; afterwards serving as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. The Duke was a prominent figure in the fashionable society of his day.

==Family==

*Lady Frances Pierrepont (died 1761), who married John Erskine, Earl of Mar
*Lady Evelyn Pierrepont (died 1727), who married John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower, and was mother of Gertrude, Duchess of Bedford
*William Pierrepont, Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull, who died of smallpox, aged 20, in July 1713. He married Rachel, (legal daughter of Thomas Baynton of Little Chalfield, Wiltshire, but biological daughter and heiress of John Hall of Bradford, Wiltshire), and had a daughter Frances (died 1795) and a son Evelyn.

His second wife was Lady Isabella Bentinck, daughter of Hans William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland, whom he married in 1714. They had two daughters:
*Lady Caroline Pierrepont (died 1753), who married Thomas Brand (senior), MP 
*Lady Anne Pierrepont (1719–1739)
He was succeeded by his grandson Evelyn, son of William.

<doc id="317317" wikidata="Q336529" url="?curid=317317" title="Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend">
<text>Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend, (; 18 April 167421 June 1738) was a British Whig statesman. From 1714 to 1717, and again from 1721 to 1730, he served as Secretary of State for the Northern Department . He directed British foreign policy in close collaboration with his brother-in-law, prime minister Robert Walpole. He was often known as Turnip Townshend because of his strong interest in farming turnips and his role in the British Agricultural Revolution.

==Early life==
Townshend was the eldest son of Sir Horatio Townshend, 3rd Baronet, who was created Baron Townshend in 1661 and Viscount Townshend in 1682. The old Norfolk family of Townshend, to which he belonged, is descended from Sir Roger Townshend (d. 1493) of Raynham, who acted as legal advisor to the Paston family, and was made a justice of the common pleas in 1484. His descendant, another Sir Roger Townshend (c. 1543–1590), had a son Sir John Townshend (1564–1603), a soldier, whose son, Sir Roger Townshend (1588– 1637), was created a baronet in 1617. He was the father of Sir Horatio Townshend.

Born at Raynham Hall, Norfolk, Townshend succeeded to the peerages in December 1687, and was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He had Tory sympathies when he took his seat in the House of Lords, but his views changed, and he began to take an active part in politics as a Whig. For a few years after the accession of Queen Anne he remained without office, but in November 1708 he was appointed Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, having in the previous year been summoned to the Privy Council. He was ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the States-General from 1709 to 1711, taking part during these years in the negotiations which preceded the conclusion of the Treaty of Utrecht.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1706.

==Secretary of State and other posts==
After his recall to England, he was busily occupied in attacking the proceedings of the new Tory ministry. Townshend quickly won the favour of George I, and in September 1714, the new king selected him as Secretary of State for the Northern Department. The policy of Townshend and his colleagues, after they had suppressed the Jacobite rising of 1715, both at home and abroad, was one of peace. Townshend was opposed to British involvement in the Great Northern War, and he promoted the conclusion of defensive alliances between Britain, Austria and France.

In spite of these successes, the influence of the Whigs was gradually undermined by the intrigues of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, and by the discontent of the Hanoverian favourites. In October 1716, Townshend&#x27;s colleague, James Stanhope afterwards 1st Earl Stanhope, accompanied the king on his visit to Hanover, and while there he was seduced from his allegiance to his fellow ministers by Sunderland, George being led to believe that Townshend and his brother-in-law, Sir Robert Walpole, were caballing with the Prince of Wales, their intention being that the prince should supplant his father on the throne. Consequently, in December 1716 Townshend was dismissed from office and made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, but he only retained this post until the following April. When he was dismissed for voting against the government, he was joined by his brother-in-law Robert Walpole and other Whig Allies. This began the Whig Split which would divide the dominant party until 1720, with the opposition Whigs joining with the Tories to defeat Stanhope&#x27;s government over several issues including the Peerage Bill of 1719.

Early in 1720 a partial reconciliation took place between the parties of Stanhope and Townshend, and in June of this year the latter became Lord President of the Council, a post which he held until February 1721, when, after the death of Stanhope and the forced retirement of Sunderland, a result of the South Sea Bubble, he was again appointed Secretary of State for the northern department, with Walpole as First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. The two remained in power during the remainder of the reign of George I the chief domestic events of the time being the impeachment of Bishop Atterbury, the pardon and partial restoration of Lord Bolingbroke, and the troubles in Ireland caused by the patent permitting Wood to coin halfpence. 

During his tenure as Secretary of State for the Northern Department, Anglo-Dutch relations improved. During the War of the Spanish Succession, the Tory Harley ministry had concluded a separate peace treaty with France without consulting their Dutch allies, causing considerable anger. The Dutch States General saw the Whig Townshend ministry, including Townshend himself, as better diplomatic partners, and the Dutch sent several thousand troops to Britain to assist in the suppression of the Jacobite rising of 1715. Townshend had previously served as Britain&#x27;s ambassador to the Dutch Republic, and was described by one British commentator as someone whose &quot;predominant passion was love of the Dutch&quot;. 

Townshend secured the dismissal of his rival, Lord Carteret, afterwards Earl Granville, but soon differences arose between himself and Walpole, and he had some difficulty in steering a course through the troubled sea of European politics. Although disliking him, George II retained him in office, but the predominance in the ministry passed gradually but surely from him to Walpole. Townshend could not brook this. So long, to use Walpole&#x27;s witty remark, as the firm was Townshend and Walpole all went well with it, but when the positions were reversed jealousies arose between the partners. Serious differences of opinion concerning the policy to be adopted towards Austria and in foreign politics generally led to a final rupture in 1730. Failing, owing to Walpole&#x27;s interference, in his efforts to procure the dismissal of a colleague and his replacement by a personal friend, Townshend retired on 15 May 1730. His departure removed the final obstacle to the conclusion of an Anglo-Austrian Alliance which would become the centrepiece of British foreign policy until 1756.

According to historians Linda Frey and Marsha Frey:
:Townshend was undoubtedly capable, determined, and hard-working, but in achieving his goals he sometimes appeared blunt, abrasive, stubborn, impatient, and overbearing. In contrast to many of his contemporaries whose venality was legendary he was scrupulously honest. He was generous to both friend and foe. He was also a passionate man who loved and hated quickly and rarely changed his mind once an opinion had been formed...Historians have often underrated Townshend&#x27;s accomplishments in part because his rival Walpole outmanoeuvred and outlasted him.

==&quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend==
His remaining years were passed at Raynham, where he interested himself in agriculture. He promoted the adoption of the Norfolk four-course system, involving the rotation of turnips, barley, clover, and wheat crops. He was an enthusiastic advocate of growing turnips as a field crop for livestock feed. As a result of his promotion of turnip-growing and his agricultural experiments at Raynham, he became known as &quot;Turnip Townshend&quot;. (Alexander Pope mentions &quot;Townshend&#x27;s turnips&quot; in &quot;Imitations of Horace, Epistle II&quot;.) Townshend is often mentioned, together with Jethro Tull, Robert Bakewell, and others, as a major figure in England&#x27;s &quot;Agricultural Revolution&quot;, contributing to the adoption of agricultural practices that led to the increase in Britain&#x27;s population between 1700 and 1850.

He died at Raynham on 21 June 1738.

==Family==

Townshend was twice married—first to the Hon. Elizabeth Pelham (1681–1711), daughter of Thomas Pelham, 1st Baron Pelham of Laughton and his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Jones of Ramsbury Manor, Attorney General for England and Wales.

Children with the Hon. Elizabeth Pelham:

He had nine sons, one of them died at a young age. The eldest son, Charles, the 3rd viscount (1700–1764), was called to the House of Lords in 1723. The second son, Thomas Townshend (1701–1780), was member of parliament for the University of Cambridge from 1727 to 1774; his only son, Thomas Townshend (1733–1800), who was created Baron Sydney in 1783 and Viscount Sydney in 1789, was a secretary of state and Leader of the House of Commons from July 1782 to April 1783, and from December 1783 to June 1789 again a secretary of state, Sydney in New South Wales being named after him; his grandson, John Robert Townshend (1805–1890), the 3rd viscount, was created Earl Sydney in 1874, the titles becoming extinct at his death. Charles Townshend&#x27;s eldest son by his second wife was George Townshend (1715–1769), who after serving for many years in the navy, became an admiral in 1765. The younger son Edward (1719–1765) became Dean of Norwich

The third viscount had two sons, George, 1st Marquess Townshend, and Charles Townshend.

Townsend was the maternal grandfather of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis.

<doc id="317318" wikidata="Q391694" url="?curid=317318" title="Golden Light Sutra">
<text>The Golden Light Sutra or  () is a Buddhist text of the Mahayana branch of Buddhism. In Sanskrit, the full title is &quot;The Sovereign King of Sutras, the Sublime Golden Light&quot;.

==History==
The sutra was originally written in India in Sanskrit and was translated several times into Chinese by Dharmakṣema and others, and later translated into Tibetan and other languages. Johannes Nobel published Sanskrit and Tibetan editions of the text. The sutra is influential in East Asia.

The name of the sutra derives from the chapter called &quot;The Confession of the Golden Drum&quot;, where the bodhisattva Ruchiraketu dreams of a great drum that radiates a sublime golden light, symbolizing the dharma or teachings of Śākyamuni Buddha.

The &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; became one of the most important sutras in China and Japan because of its fundamental message, which teaches that the Four Heavenly Kings () protect the ruler who governs his country in the proper manner.

The sutra also expounds the vows of the goddesses Sarasvatī (), Lakṣmī () and Prithvi to protect any bhikṣu who will uphold and teach the sutra.

Taken at face value, one might take the main theme of the sutra literally, which is the importance for leaders to be good examples for the kingdom. In Chapter Twelve, the sutra speaks in verse form about the disasters that befall a kingdom when its ruler does not uphold justice, and the benefits of kings who lead an exemplary life. In the Chapter on the Guardian Kings, the Four Guardian Kings have a dialogue with the Buddha, explaining in vivid detail all the benefits a kingdom will have if its ruler enshrines the essence of the sutra and offers daily praise. The sutra contains some elements of early tantra, in that in chapter two, the sutra describes four Buddhas who dwell in the four cardinal directions. These same four comprise later Buddhist mandalas in the same positions, such as the Womb Realm.

During the Sui dynasty in China, the monk Zhiyi of the Tiantai tradition initiated a ritual ceremony known as &quot;Gōngfó Zhāitiān&quot; (供佛齋天) or just &quot;Zhāitiān&quot; (齋天), meaning &quot;Puja of Offering to the Buddhas and the Devas&quot;, according to the rites prescribed in the &quot;Golden Light Sutra.&quot; During the ceremony, offerings are made to the Buddhas as well as the twenty-four devas as a sign of respect. This ceremony has been carried down through tradition into modern times and is customarily performed in Chinese Buddhist temples on the 9th day of the 1st month of the Chinese calendar.

The sutra also gained esteem as a sutra for protecting the country in China, Korea and Japan, and often was read publicly to ward off threats. For example, its first reading in Japan was as a court ceremony during around 660 AD, when the Tang dynasty of China and Silla of Korea defeated the state of Baekje of Korea and were threatening Japan. In 741 Emperor Shōmu of Japan founded provincial monasteries for monks (国分寺) and nuns (国分尼寺) in each province. The official name of the monasteries was the &quot;Temple for Protection of the State by the Four Heavenly Kings Golden Light Sutra&quot; (). The 20 monks who lived there recited the &quot;Sovereign Kings Golden Light Sutra&quot; on a fixed schedule to protect the country. As Buddhism evolved in Japan, the practice gradually fell out of use, and is no longer continued today.

==Translations==
The Golden Light Sutra has been translated into Chinese, Saka (&quot;Khotanese&quot;), Old Uyghur by Shingqo Sheli Tutung, Tangut, Classical Tibetan, Mongolian, Manchu, Korean and Japanese.

===Chinese===

Three canonical Chinese translations have survived:
* Jin guangming jin T663 translated by Dharmakṣema (385–433)
* the synoptic Hebu jin guangming T664, by Baogui, written in 597
* Jin guangming zuisheng wang jin T665, by Yijing (635–713)

An extracanonical version, ascribed to Paramārtha, (499–569) is extant in a Japanese manuscript.

===Japanese===
One of the earliest Japanese annotations was an 8th-century kunten translation of the Yijing Chinese translation housed in Saidaiji Temple.

In 1933, Izumi published the first complete Japanese translation directly from Sanskrit, followed by another translation by Ama a year later.

===Western languages===
In 1958, Nobel published a German translation, based on Yijing&#x27;s Chinese text.
In 1970, R. E. Emmerick produced an English translation of the short, condensed Sanskrit version of the Sutra of Golden Light into English.

In Tibetan, there are three versions of the Sutra: the 21, 29, and 31 chapter versions. The 29 Chapter Version was probably the most popular in Tibet and Tibetan Buddhist regions.

In 2007, the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, Lama Zopa Rinpoche&#x27;s Buddhist organization, produced a translation of the 21 chapter version of the Sutra, the most abbreviated and condensed version.

In 2023, 84000.co published a translation of the 21 chapter version, followed in 2024 by the first English translations of the 29 and 31 chapter versions.

<text>Shen Buhai (; c. 400 BCc. 337 BC) was a Chinese statesman, reformer and diplomat. According to the Shiji, Shen Buhai served served as Chancellor of the Hann state under Marquis Zhao of Han, for around fifteen years to his natural death in office in 337 BC, ordering it&#x27;s government and doctrines emphasizing administrative technique (Shu), though the term is Han Fei&#x27;s. A contemporary of syncretist Shi Jiao and Shang Yang, Shen was born in the State of Zheng, likely serving as a minor official there. After Hann completed the conquest and division of Zheng and Wei in 376 BC, he rose up in the ranks of the Han officialdom, reforming it&#x27;s administration and military defenses only about a half century after its founding.

Although Michael Loewe would caution against attributing too much to any one individual, Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel saw in Shen Buhai the &quot;seeds of the civil service examination,&quot; and perhaps even the first political scientist, seeming to play an influence on Han dynasty reformers. With the imperial examination extending in influence to the European civil service, A.C. Graham still took seriously the possibility that Shen Buhai was a founder in world bureaucracy.

Despite this later influence, by the standards of the late Han Feizi Shen Buhai was only partly successful in reforming the newly formed Han state, not consolidating its laws as Shang Yang had in the Qin state. His administrative ideas were influential enough to become one of the Xun Kuang&#x27;s critiqued &quot;Twelve Masters&quot; in the later Warring States period, and might have been renowned by the time of the Han Feizi. But as compared with Shen Dao, it is not as evident that he was earlier well known as a philosopher. A figure in the Stratagems of the Warring States, Chapter 5 of the Han Feizi recalls him alongside Laozi. Sima Qian discusses Han Fei and Shen Buhai alongside Laozi and Zhuang Zhou in Chapter 63 of the Shiji.

Though more conciliatory, Shen Buhai&#x27;s fragments most resemble the Han Feizi, which contrasts him with Shang Yang in chapter 63. After the Han Feizi, Shen Buhai was often recalled together with Shang Yang. But Shen Buhai was not necessarily familiar with Shang Yang, and by contrast appears to have opposed punishment, in hopes that a strict, efficient administration would &quot;abolish&quot; the need for it. Nonetheless, his administrative ideas were relevant for penal records and practice by the Han dynasty, and Han Confucian archivists likely incorporated him into the Fa or &quot;Legalist&quot; school partly due to the influence of the Han Feizi&#x27;s syncretic association. They would not seem to attempt to paint him as a Shang-Yangian figure individually.

Although Sinologists Benjamin Schwartz and Hansen (modernly of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Daoism) would take Shen Dao as a more relevant Daoistic forebear, Creel believed that Shen Buhai&#x27;s correlation between an (Wu-wei) &quot;inactive&quot; ruler, and a handling of claims and titles may have informed the Daoist conception of the formless Dao (name that cannot be named) that &quot;gives rise to the ten thousand things.&quot; He is credited with the dictum: The Sage ruler relies on measures and not on wisdom; he relies on technique, not on persuasions.

==Dating==
Only the questionable death date of Shen Buhai in 337 B.C. is correlated between multiple sources. He was supposed by Ch&#x27;ien Mu to have lived sixty or seventy years. The birth date of 400 B.C. is a compromise between 397 and 407 that was believed to be &quot;safe&quot; by German Sinologist Alfred Forke. Professor Tao Jiang still used it modernly in his 2021 dissertation, &quot;Origins of moral-political philosophy in early China.&quot; Sometimes the birth date is simply left out.

Although Shen Buhai is recorded in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Historical Records&quot; as becoming Chancellor in Marquis Chao&#x27;s eight year, traditionally 351, Creel and Ch&#x27;ien Mu suggested it more probable to date Shen Buhai&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor, and the Marquis eighth year, earlier, in 354/355~, after the state of Wei sieged the state of Chao. As an earlier source, the &quot;Stratagems of the Warring States&quot; state that Shen Buhai had just found favor with the Marquis at the time of that event. Despite the comparatively minor disagreement with Sima Qian,
which would make his time as chancellor a little over fifteen years, Shen Buhai&#x27;s appointment is likely the most accurate dating that can be determined for his life in general.

==Shenzi==
Shen was known for his cryptic writing style. Because the quotations attributed to him appear to be pre-Han dynasty, he is credited with writing a now extinct two chapter text, the &quot;Shenzi&quot; (), which is concerned almost exclusively with the philosophy of governmental administration. In 141 BC, under the influence of Confucians, the reign of Emperor Wu of Han saw Shen Buhai&#x27;s name listed along with other thinkers classed as &quot;Legalist&quot; (Fajia, later described as Legalist which would be more accurate for Shang Yang), officially banning their ideas from the government; from that point on, scholarship relating to Shen&#x27;s ideas went into a steep decline, despite continued use of his foundational ideas in administration, much of which, consisting of skill and report checking, would be unavoidable).

Widely read in Han times, in comparison to the still-complete Han Feizi the Shenzi was listed as lost by the Liang dynasty (502–556). Appearing again in the bibliographies of both Tang histories, its only traces remain as quotes in surviving texts in &quot;Qunshu Zhiyao&quot;, compiled in 631, and &quot;Yilin&quot;, compiled around 786. During the Qing Dynasty, three major attempts were made to reconstruct the contents of the work, the last mention occurring in 1616, and in a library catalogue from 1700. Creel believed that it still existed in 1616. With the assistance of T.H. Tsien Its fragments were re-assembled by Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel (1974) in Shen Pu-Hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B. C., which were still used more modernly by Korean scholar Soon-Ja Yang in her review of Shen Buhai.

==Opposition to punishment==
As quoted by Pei Yin, Liu Xiang recalls Shen Buhai as a figure who recommended that the ruler &quot;grasp (administrative) technique (shu)&quot; in-order to &quot;do away&quot; with the punishment of ministers, relying on supervision and accountability. In a round about way, his administrative ideas might have contributed to penal records and practice by the Han dynasty, but according to the Han Feizi, Shen Buhai had disorganized law in the early Hann state. No Han or earlier text individually connects him with penal law, but only with control of bureaucracy. The Huainanzi and Hanshu only gloss him as a penal figure (or Legalist) when discussing him alongside Shang Yang and the Han Feizi.

==Philosophy==

Though not unifying the laws of the early Hann state, as Shang Yang did in the Qin, what Shen &quot;appears to have realized&quot; is that the &quot;methods for the control of a bureaucracy&quot; could not be mixed with feudal government, or staffed merely by &quot;getting together a group of &#x27;good men,&#x27;&quot; but must be men qualified in their jobs. Unlike Shang Yang, Shen therefore emphasizes the importance of selecting able officials as much as Confucius did, but insists on &quot;constant vigilance over their performance.&quot;

Shen insisted that the ruler must be fully informed on the state of his realm, but couldn&#x27;t afford to get caught up in details – and does not, Creel says, have the time to do so, eschewing personal appointments. The way to see and hear independently is by grouping particulars into categories through mechanical or operational decision-making (Fa or &quot;method&quot;).

However, in comparison with the later, more mechanically developed Han Fei, his system still required a strong ruler, emphasizing that he trust no one minister. Shen Buhai&#x27;s ideal ruler would still have to have had the widest possible sovereignty, be intelligent (if not a sage), have to make all crucial decisions himself, and have unlimited control of the bureaucracy - over which, in contrast to Shang Yang, he is simply the head. Championing &quot;Fa&quot; (法 &quot;method&quot;), Shen believed that the greatest threat to a ruler&#x27;s power came from within, and unlike Han Fei, never preaches to his ministers about duty or loyalty.

Shen Buhai&#x27;s doctrines, posthumously referred to by Han Fei as Shu or Technique (a term Shen may not have used), are described as concerned almost exclusively with the &quot;ruler&#x27;s role and the methods by which he may control a bureaucracy,&quot; that is, its management and personnel control: the selection of capable ministers, their performance, the monopolization of power, and the control of and relations between ruler and minister which he characterized as Wu Wei. They can therefore easily be considered the most crucial element in controlling a bureaucracy.

More specifically, Shen Buhai&#x27;s methods (Fa) focused on &quot;scrutinizing achievement and on that ground alone to give rewards, and to bestow office solely on the basis of ability.&quot; Liu Xiang wrote that Shen Buhai advised the ruler of men use technique (shu) rather than punishment, relying on persuasion to supervise and hold responsible, though very strictly. Liu considered Shen&#x27;s &quot;principal tenet&quot; to be (&quot;Xing-Ming&quot; 刑名). Representing equally applied checks against the power of officials, Xing-Ming seeks the right person for the job through the examination of skill, achievement and (more rarely) seniority.

=== Personnel selection ===
Shen Buhai&#x27;s personnel control, or rectification of names (crudely, &quot;office titles&quot;) worked through &quot;strict performance control,&quot; correlating performance and posts. It would become a central tenet of both &quot;Legalist&quot; statecraft and its Taoistic derivatives. Creel believed that the correlation between Wu-wei and Xing-ming may have informed the Taoist conception of the formless Tao that &quot;gives rise to the ten thousand things.&quot;

In the Han Dynasty secretaries of government who had charge of the records of decisions in criminal matters were called Xing-Ming, a term used by Han Fei, which Sima Qian (145 or 135 – 86 BC) and Liu Xiang (77 BC – 6 BC) attributed to the doctrine of Shen Buhai(400 BC – c. 337 BC). Liu Xiang goes as far as to define Shen Buhai&#x27;s doctrine as Xing-Ming. Shen actually used an older, more philosophically common equivalent, ming-shih, linking the &quot;Legalist doctrine of names&quot; with the name and reality (ming shih) debates of the school of names. Such discussions are also prominent in the Han Feizi.

Sima Qian and Liu Xiang define Xing-Ming as &quot;holding actual outcome accountable to Ming.&quot; Ming sometimes has the sense of speech—so as to compare the statements of an aspiring officer with the reality of his actions—or reputation, again compared with real conduct (xing &quot;form&quot; or shih &quot;reality&quot;). Rather than having to look for &quot;good&quot; men, Xing-Ming (or ming-shih) can seek the right man for a particular post, though doing so implies a total organizational knowledge of the regime. More simply though, it can allow ministers to come forward with proposals of specific cost and time frame, leaving their definition to competing ministers—the doctrine favored by Han Fei. Preferring exactness, it combats the tendency to promise too much; the correct articulation of Ming is considered crucial to the realization of projects.

The logician Deng Xi (died 501 BCE) is cited by Liu Xiang for the origin of the principle of Xing-Ming. Serving as a minor official in the state of Zheng, he is reported to have drawn up a code of penal laws. Associated with litigation, he is said to have argued for the permissibility of contradictory propositions, likely engaging in hair-splitting debates on the interpretation of laws, legal principles and definitions.

Shen Buhai solves this through Wu wei, or not getting involved, making an official&#x27;s words his own responsibility. Shen Buhai says, &quot;The ruler controls the policy, the ministers manage affairs. To speak ten times and ten times be right, to act a hundred times and a hundred times succeed - this is the business of one who serves another as minister; it is not the way to rule.&quot; Noting all the details of a claim and then attempting to objectively compare them with his achievements through passive mindfulness (the &quot;method of yin&quot;), Shen Buhai&#x27;s ruler neither adds to nor detracts from anything, giving names (titles/offices) on the basis of claim.

Shen supported reward for visible results, using ming-shih for investigation and appointment, but the legal system of Han was apparently confused, prohibiting uniform reward and punishment. We have no basis to suppose that Shen advocated the doctrine of rewards and punishment (of Shang Yang, as Han Fei did), and Han Fei criticizes him for not unifying the laws.

===Wu wei===
Following Shen, Han Fei strongly advocated Wu wei. During the Han dynasty up until the reign of Han Wudi, rulers confined their activity &quot;chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials,&quot; a plainly &quot;Legalist&quot; practice inherited from the Qin dynasty. This &quot;conception of the ruler&#x27;s role as a supreme arbiter, who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp&quot; while leaving details to ministers, has a &quot;deep influence on the theory and practice of Chinese monarchy.&quot;

Shen Buhai argued that if the government were organized and supervised relying on proper method (Fa), the ruler need do little—and must do little. Unlike &quot;Legalists&quot; Shang Yang and Han Fei, Shen did not consider the relationship between ruler and minister antagonistic necessarily. Apparently paraphrasing the Analects, Shen Buhai&#x27;s statement that those near him will feel affection, while the far will yearn for him, stands in contrast to Han Fei, who considered the relationship between the ruler and ministers irreconcilable.

However, Shen still believed that the ruler&#x27;s most able ministers are his greatest danger, and is convinced that it is impossible to make them loyal without techniques. Creel explains: &quot;The ruler&#x27;s subjects are so numerous, and so on alert to discover his weaknesses and get the better of him, that it is hopeless for him alone as one man to try to learn their characteristics and control them by his knowledge... the ruler must refrain from taking the initiative, and from making himself conspicuous--and therefore vulnerable--by taking any overt action.&quot;

Emphasizing the use of administrative methods (Fa) in secrecy, Shen Buhai portrays the ruler as putting up a front to hide his weaknesses and dependence on his advisers. Shen therefore advises the ruler to keep his own counsel, hide his motivations, and conceal his tracks in inaction, availing himself of an appearance of stupidity and insufficiency. Shen says:

Acting through administrative method (Fa), the ruler conceals his intentions, likes and dislikes, skills and opinions. Not acting himself, he can avoid being manipulated. The ruler plays no active role in governmental functions. He should not use his talent even if he has it. Not using his own skills, he is better able to secure the services of capable functionaries. Creel argues that not getting involved in details allowed Shen&#x27;s ruler to &quot;truly rule,&quot; because it leaves him free to supervise the government without interfering, maintaining his perspective. Seeing and hearing independently, the ruler is able to make decisions independently, and is, Shen says, able to rule the world thereby.

This Wu wei (or nonaction) might be said to end up the political theory of the &quot;Legalists,&quot; if not becoming their general term for political strategy, playing a &quot;crucial role in the promotion of the autocratic tradition of the Chinese polity.&quot; The (qualified) non-action of the ruler ensures his power and the stability of the polity.

====Yin (passive mindfulness)====
A commentary to the Shiji cites a now-lost book, quoting as Shen Buhai saying: &quot;By employing (yin), &#x27;passive mindfulness&#x27;, in overseeing and keeping account of his vassals, accountability is deeply engraved.&quot; The Guanzi similarly says: &quot;Yin is the way of non-action. Yin is neither to add to nor to detract from anything. To give something a name strictly on the basis of its form – this is the Method of yin.&quot; Yin aimed at concealing the ruler&#x27;s intentions, likes and opinions. Despite such injunctions, it is clear that the ruler&#x27;s assignments would still be completely up to him.

Sinologist John Makeham explains: &quot;assessing words and deeds requires the ruler&#x27;s dispassionate attention; (yin is) the skill or technique of making one&#x27;s mind a tabula rasa, non-committaly taking note of all the details of a man&#x27;s claims and then objectively comparing his achievements of the original claims.&quot; Adherence to the use of technique in governing requires the ruler not engage in any interference or subjective consideration.

==Appendix==
===Fajia briefing===
Originally credited by Creel as syncretic precedent for Shen Buhai&#x27;s Han dynasty association within the Fajia, Chapter 43 of the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; says:

Although Shu technique appears in the Shen Buhai fragments, Creel would argue that it had not evolved in yet Shen Buhai&#x27;s time, considering their fragments as representing a later interpolation. It&#x27;s question is a point of contention for the nature of Shen Buhai. As would not be unique, Edward L. Shaughnessy glosses Shen Buhai under Han Fei&#x27;s Shu. He does not interpret him along Han Fei lines, but others have simply glossed Shen Buhai along Han Fei lines, with the tactics and trickery of the Han Feizi&#x27;s later chapters, and even the harsh laws of Shang Yang. But, they would not appear to present any academic argument available in the English language.

===Legalist speculations===
Sinologist Hansen (1992), current of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Daoism, recalls Benjamin Schwarz (1985) as citing Han Fei&#x27;s two handles of punishment and reward as clearly part of Shu, in rebuttal to Creel&#x27;s insistence that Shen Buhai was not a Legalist. As at least illustrative of Han Fei, Hansen focuses on Shu &quot;method&quot; or &quot;technique&quot; as safeguarding the ruler&#x27;s power to punish and reward, which must be kept in his hands, that punishment and reward can not be meted out without the ruler&#x27;s approval, or that persons are immune to it. 

As compared with Shang Yang, the thrust of the more administrative Shu is not the establishment of fa as codified law. Rather, relying on fa (objective standards), the ruler ought at least not mete out reward or punishment on mere recommendation or fame. A monopoly over reward and punishment does not itself make Shen Buhai or his ruler a Shang Yangian Legalist, even if Han Fei advocates it. Hence, Creel would argue that Han Fei does not himself consider Shen Buhai a Shang Yangian Legalist (although the concept of Legalist did not exist yet.)

Whether it was itself relying on the Han Feizi&#x27;s account or not, the Huainanzi says that when Shen Buhai lived, the officials of the state of Han were at cross-purposes and did not know what practices to follow. Shaughnessy points out that Shen Buhai would have at least been aware of Li Kui&#x27;s book of law, as Shang Yang&#x27;s predecessor. Taking Li Kui as a hypothetical influence, Shaughnessy only suggests Shen Buhai as similar in the sense of attempting to implement a more meritocratic government. 

Tao Jiang notes Korean scholar Soon-Ja Yang as still relying on Creel&#x27;s fragments, taking the &quot;absence of Shu much more seriously.&quot; Opposing Han Fei&#x27;s comparison of him with Shang Yang, in favour of a more Confucian-Legalist interpretation, she interpolates a universal registry along the lines of the Confucian rectification of names. Not specifically endorsing the interpretation, Tao Jiang takes her as illustrative of Creel, namely that Shen Buhai does not follow Han Fei&#x27;s (significantly later) broader doctrine, but rather as aiming at a cooperative, impartial government along Creel lines.

===Legacy===
Considering Creel correct to distinguish between the stands of &#x27;Legalism&#x27;, Michael Loewe, in the Cambridge History of China, argued for their complementarity. Han Fei called both branches &quot;the instruments of Kings and Emperors,&quot; and Li Si praises them equally, finding no contradiction between them. If he was influential in it, Loewe supposes that Shen Buhai&#x27;s influence may have made Qin government more sophisticated and reasonable, as it appeared, than could be expected of the dogma of the Book of Lord Shang alone. Questioning the thrust of tracing lineages between the personas, Loewe characterizes Han dynasty persons potentially influenced by Shen Buhai as sympathizers of imperial government over that of the small states, endeavoring to permanently establish imperial government without the dangers that destroyed the Qin.

Creel elaborates a number of figures influenced potentially by Shen Buhai. These include Emperor Qinshihuang, Han figures Jia Yi, Emperor Wen of Han, Emperor Jing of Han, Chao Cuo, Dong Zhongshu, Gongsun Hong, and Emperor Xuan of Han, and Emperor Wen of Sui. Although a Confucian-oriented minister, Zhuge Liang is noted (by others) as attaching great importance to the work of Han Fei and Shen Buhai. Emperor Qinshihuang erected an inscription naming himself as taking control of the government and for the first time establishing Xing-Ming, as retroactive terminology for Shen Buhai&#x27;s method.

The Shiji records Li Si as repeatedly recommending &quot;supervising and holding responsible,&quot; which he attributed to Shen Buhai. A stele set up by Qin Shi Huang memorializes him as a sage that, taking charge of the government, established Xing-Ming. The Shiji states that Emperor Wen of Han was &quot;basically fond of Xing-Ming.&quot; 

The scholar Jia Yi advised Wen to teach his heir to use Shen Buhai&#x27;s method, so as to be able to &quot;supervise the functions of the many officials and understand the usages of government.&quot; Bringing together Confucian and Daoist discourses, Jia Yi describes Shen Buhai&#x27;s Shu as a particular method of applying the Dao, or virtue. He uses the imagery of the Zhuangzi of the knife and hatchet as examples of skillful technique in both virtue and force, saying &quot;benevolence, righteousness, kindness and generosity are the ruler&#x27;s sharp knife. Power, purchase, law and regulation are his axe and hatchet.&quot; Two advisors to Wen&#x27;s heir, Emperor Jing of Han were students of Xing-Ming, one passing the highest grade of examination, and admonished Jing for not using it on the feudal lords.

By the time of the civil service examination was put into place, Confucian influence saw outright discussion of Shen Buhai banned. However, the Emperor under which it was founded, Emperor Wu of Han, was both familiar with and favorable to Legalist ideas, and the civil service examination did not come into existence until its support by Gongsun Hong, who wrote a book on Xing-Ming. The Emperor Xuan of Han was still said by Liu Xiang to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai, using Xing-Ming to control his subordinates and devoting much time to legal cases.

Heir successor Emperor Jing of Han also had two mentors in the doctrines of Shen Buhai, and appointed another Legalist, Chao Cuo. Chao Cuo is regarded by the Hanshu as a student of the doctrines of Shen Buhai, Shang Yang and Xing-Ming. Unlike Jia Yi, he does appear to take interest in Shang Yang. Following the Rebellion of the Seven Kingdoms, Emperor Jing reformed criminal penalties to reduce injustices and punishments.

An advocate for the civil service examinations, Dong Zhongshu&#x27;s writings on personnel testing and control uses Ming-shih in a manner &quot;hardly distinguishable&quot; from the Han Feizi, but unlike Han Fei, advocate against punishments. Dong&#x27;s advocacy aside, the civil service examination did not come into existence until its support by Gongsun Hong, who wrote a book on &quot;xingming&quot;. Thus, Creel credits the origination of the civil service examination in part to Shen Buhai.

The Emperor Xuan of Han was still said by Liu Xiang to have been fond of reading Shen Buhai, using Xing-Ming to control his subordinates and devoting much time to legal cases. Regarded as being in opposition to Confucians, as Confucianism ascended the term disappeared. As early as the Eastern Han its full and original meaning would be forgotten. Yet, it appears in later dynasties, and Emperor Wen of Sui is recorded as having withdrawn his favour from the Confucians, giving it to &quot;the group advocating Xing-Ming and authoritarian government.&quot;

<text>A dormitory (originated from the Latin word &quot;dormitorium&quot;, often abbreviated to dorm), also known as a hall of residence or a residence hall (often abbreviated to halls), is a building primarily providing sleeping and residential quarters for large numbers of people such as boarding school, college or university students. In some countries, it can also refer to a room containing several beds accommodating people.

==Terminology==
Dormitory is sometimes abbreviated to &quot;dorm&quot;. In the UK, the word dormitory means a room (rather than a building) containing several beds accommodating unrelated people. This arrangement exists typically for pupils at boarding schools, travellers and military personnel, but is almost entirely unknown for university students. Student housing is normally referred to as &quot;halls&quot; or &quot;halls of residence&quot;, or &quot;colleges&quot; in universities with residential colleges. A building providing sleeping and residential quarters for large numbers of people may also be called a house (members of a religious community or pupils at a boarding school), hostel (students, workers or travelers) or barracks (military personnel).

In English-speaking Canada, the common term is &quot;residence&quot; or &quot;res&quot; for short. At colleges and universities in the US, the term &quot;residence hall&quot; is often used instead of &quot;dormitory&quot;. In Australia the terms &quot;halls of residence&quot; and &quot;halls&quot; are common, but &quot;&quot; (or, more formally, &quot;residential college&quot;) is also used in the cases of halls of residence that are named as such (e.g., Robert Menzies College, Trinity College and Mannix College).

==College and university residences==

=== United States ===


In the early colonial colleges, residence was often provided for students within the main college building, such as the Wren Building at the William &amp; Mary (1705) and Nassau Hall at Princeton (1756); these went on to inspire other &quot;Old Main&quot; buildings, combining academic functions with accommodation. The first primarily residential building was the Harvard Indian College (1650), which also contained a printing press, while the first exclusively residential building was Stoughton Hall (1698), also at Harvard.

Most colleges and universities provide single or multiple occupancy rooms for their students, usually at a cost. These buildings consist of many such rooms, like an apartment building. The largest dormitory building in the US is said to be Bancroft Hall at the United States Naval Academy, housing 4,400 midshipmen in 1,700 multiple occupancy rooms.

Many colleges and universities no longer use the word &quot;dormitory&quot; and staff are now using the term residence hall (analogous to the United Kingdom &quot;hall of residence&quot;) or simply &quot;hall&quot; instead. Outside academia however, the word &quot;dorm&quot; or &quot;dormitory&quot; is commonly used without negative connotations. Indeed, the words are used regularly in the marketplace as well as routinely in advertising.

Typically, a United States residence hall room holds two students with no toilet. This is usually referred to as a &quot;double&quot;. Often, residence halls have communal bathroom facilities.
In the United States, residence halls are sometimes segregated by sex, with men living in one group of rooms, and women in another. Some dormitory complexes are single-sex with varying limits on visits by persons of each sex. For example, the University of Notre Dame in Indiana has a long history of &quot;parietals&quot;, or mixed visiting hours. Most colleges and universities offer coeducational dorms, where either men or women reside on separate floors but in the same building or where both sexes share a floor but with individual rooms being single-sex. In the early 2000s, dorms that allowed people of opposite sexes to share a room became available in some public universities. Some colleges and university coeducational dormitories also feature coeducational bathrooms. Many newer residence halls offer single rooms as well as private bathrooms, or suite-style rooms.

Most residence halls are much closer to campus than comparable private housing such as apartment buildings. This convenience is a major factor in the choice of where to live since living physically closer to classrooms is often preferred, particularly for first-year students who may not be permitted to park vehicles on campus. Universities may therefore provide priority to first-year students when allocating this accommodation.

===United Kingdom===
====Historical development====

Until the mid 19th century, students at residential universities in England lived in colleges, where they rented a set of unfurnished rooms, paid their own servants, and bought their own meals. The first change from this came with the foundation of Bishop Hatfield&#x27;s Hall (now Hatfield College) by David Melville at Durham University in 1846. This introduced three key concepts: rooms would be let furnished, all meals would be taken communally, and all expenses would be reasonable and fixed in advance, which combined to make the cost of accommodation in the hall much lower than in colleges. Melville also introduced single room study-bedrooms and, in 1849, opened the first purpose-built hall of residence in the country at Hatfield. The Oxford University Commission of 1852 found that &quot;The success that has attended Mr. Melville&#x27;s labours in Hatfield Hall at Durham is regarded as a conclusive argument for imitating that institution in Oxford&quot;; this report led to a requirement in the Oxford University Act 1854 that Oxford allow the 
establishment of private halls, although these halls were never very successful.

The 19th century London colleges were originally non-residential. King&#x27;s College London established a hall for theological students in a house adjacent to the college in 1847, although this only lasted until 1858. University Hall was opened in 1849 by a group of mainly Unitarian Dissenters for students at University College London. This also struggled until taken over by Manchester New College in 1881, after which it flourished for a period but was subsequently closed when that college moved to Oxford in 1890. Bedford College, London, at the time the only women&#x27;s college in Britain, opened a residence in 1860. College Hall, London was established in 1882 for women students at University College London (which had become mixed a few years earlier) and the London School of Medicine for Women. Like the other London halls (with the exception of the Bedford College residence) this was initially private, but was taken over by the University of London in 1910.

The provincial university colleges that became the redbrick universities were established as non-residential institutions in the 19th century, but later became the universities most closely associated with the development of halls of residence (as distinct from the residential colleges of the older universities). William Whyte identifies four main drivers for the building of halls of residence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These were: firstly, for philanthropic reasons (often linked to religion), such as the Anglican St Anselm Hall (1872/1907) and the Quaker Dalton Hall (1881), both at Owens College (now the University of Manchester); secondly, to provide safe accommodation for female undergraduates, who it was felt at that time could not live in lodgings; thirdly, to attract students from more distant parts of the country, particularly for university colleges in smaller urban areas such as Reading, Exeter and Leicester; and fourthly, because residential provision was becoming seen as an essential element of university life, allowing for the development of community.

In 1925, the University Grants Committee identified the need for more halls of residence as the most urgent of its priorities. A report for the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals in 1948 found that, in 1937–38, the highest percentages of students in colleges and halls of residence (outside of Oxford and Cambridge) were at Exeter (79 per cent), Reading (76 per ent), Southampton (65 per cent), Nottingham (42 per cent), Bristol (36 per cent) and Durham (32 per cent across both Durham and Newcastle divisions); all other universities were below 25 per cent. Funding in the post-war period led to the construction of many new halls, with 67 built between 1944 and 1957. Yet the expansion of higher education in this same period meant that the proportion of students in halls hardly increased: while between 1943 and 1963 the number of students living at home fell from 42 per cent to 20 per cent, the number in private lodgings increased from 33 per cent to 52 per cent, leading to the Robbins Report identifying a need for &quot;a very great increase in the housing provided by universities&quot;.

The post-war expansion in halls of residence meant universities looked for relatively cheap and quick construction, turning to functional modern architecture rather than the more traditional designs of earlier halls. Notable architects involved in designing halls of residence in this period included Basil Spence, who designed the University of Southampton&#x27;s Highfield Campus and the University of Sussex, Denys Lasdun&#x27;s &quot;five minute university&quot; at the University of East Anglia, including its &#x27;ziggurat&#x27; halls of residence, and James Stirling&#x27;s Andrew Melville Hall at the University of St Andrews, &quot;one of the most significant post-war buildings in Scotland&quot; according to Historic Environment Scotland.

====Current halls of residence====
Most UK universities provide accommodation in halls for first year students who make a firm acceptance of their offer, although this may not extend to students who enter via clearing. Halls accommodation most commonly consists of shared flats, but rooms may also be arranged &#x27;dorm-style&#x27; along corridors. Rooms may be en suite or there may be a shared bathroom for the flat or corridor. Halls may be catered, part-catered or self-catered. Most universities offer single-sex flats within halls and there are a few halls (such as Aberdare Hall at Cardiff University) that are entirely single-sex, but others (such as University College London) offer only mixed accommodation. Most university or college-managed halls of residence are covered by Universities UK and Guild HE&#x27;s accommodation code of practice.

Private halls of residence, also known as purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA), are available in many university towns and cities. Many are covered by the Accreditation Network UK Code of Standards for Larger Developments, and housing services at some universities (such as the University of London) will only list accredited PBSAs. Many halls are delivered in partnership between educational establishments and private developers, and both codes include the same methodology for defining whether a hall counts as &quot;managed and controlled by an educational establishment&quot;, making it a university hall, or is a private hall. Private halls may include facilities such as common rooms, gyms and study spaces. Private halls are often the most expensive accommodation option available in university towns. Some of the companies which have developed such accommodation are based offshore, which has led to concerns about tax avoidance and evasion of sanctions on Russian owners.

In the 2021/22 academic year, 347,680 (16 per cent) of the UK&#x27;s 2,185,665 students were living in accommodation maintained by their higher education provider (including 55,380 at universities with residential colleges rather than halls) and 200,895 (nine per cent) were in private-sector halls.

Within London, the London Plan that was adopted in 2021 specified that PBSAs had to have a minimum of 35 per cent of rooms rented at 55 per cent or less of the maximum student loan for London. However, this has had the effect of making PBSAs not financially viable in more expensive areas of London, so development of new PBSAs has been primarily in outer London. A majority of rooms, including all of the affordable rooms, also had to be linked to a university via a contractural nomination agreement. As this puts financial risks on the institutions, particularly with uncertainties over international student recruitment, this has led to the four richest institutions (Imperial College London, King&#x27;s College London, London School of Economics and University College London) dominating the supply of new halls. Analysis of student numbers in London has shown that, as of 2024, 111,000 students are guaranteed a place in halls (including contracted private halls) by their universities but that there were only around 100,000 beds in university halls and private PBSAs. This has led University College London to remove their housing guarantee for incoming students and replace it with a system of priority groups.

Studies in Australia, New Zealand and the UK have shown that international students prefer to live in PBSAs while domestic students prefer houses in multiple occupation, raising concerns that PBSAs drive geographies of exclusion, with international and domestic students becoming segregated.

===Germany===
In Germany, dormitories are called &quot;Studentenwohnheim&quot; (plural: &quot;Studentenwohnheime&quot;). Many of these are run by &quot;Studentenwerke&quot; (student services organisations), which have around 195,000 spaces across the country in over 1,700 halls. Some &quot;Studentenwohnheime&quot; are run by a Catholic or Protestant church. Church-run facilities are sometimes single-sex.
&quot;Studentenwohnheime&quot; may be situated on or off campus. They are usually low cost and serve students with limited budget. Flats may be shared with other students or may be studio-type, with en-suite bathroom and kitchen facilities. The rooms themselves are mostly single occupancy.

=== India ===
In India the dormitories are called &quot;PG housing&quot; or &quot;student hostels&quot;. Even though most of the colleges/universities have hostels on-campus, however in most of the cases it is not enough for the total students enrolled. Majority of the students prefer to stay off-campus in PGs and private hostels as they usually have better amenities and services. For example, in 2015 estimated 1.8 lakh (180,000) students enrolled with Delhi University, there are only about 9,000 seats available in its hostels for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. The university admits an average of 54,000 students every year. Which leaves a majority of students to find accommodation off-campus. This has led to a lot of student hostel or student PG chains to be established near Delhi University.

===France===

In France dormitories are called &quot;chambres universitaires&quot; managed by regional public services called CROUS. They are usually located nearby or inside university campuses but many exceptions occur as universities may be settled within cities. Rooms are usually individual with a collective kitchen and often collective bathrooms. Some &quot;university cities&quot; are famous such as the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris.

===Hong Kong===

Universities in Hong Kong are modeled on the British education system, with halls consequently being similar to those in the United Kingdom.

===China===

In China, dormitories are called &quot;宿舍&quot; (pinyin: sùshè). Dorms for mainland Chinese students usually have four to six students of the same sex living together in one room, with buildings usually being entirely gender-segregated and sometimes intentionally placed at some distance from each other to make inappropriate fraternization between male and female students more difficult. Sleeping hours may be enforced by cutting electricity at a given time, for instance at midnight.

Chinese students from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan live separately in their own dorms, as do foreigners. Mainlanders who are fluent in English or any foreign language may live in the foreigner- Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan dorms, assuming they will be a roommate and participate in the foreign student activities, in order to help people get accustomed to mainland Chinese life. The quality of these dorms is usually better than that of mainland student dorms, with rooms either shared between only two people or completely private for a single student. Sexual decency attitudes are laxer than in mainlander dorms, with males and females sharing the same buildings and sometimes corridors (though not rooms). Students are allowed to bring visitors – including mainlanders – of the opposite sex to their rooms. Guests may or may not be allowed to stay overnight, depending on the rules of the dorm. Electricity is usually available at all hours of the day.

Most dormitories for foreigners are run by the Foreign Students&#x27; Education Office (a department providing support services to students in China). They may be on campus or off campus. They are usually low cost and serve students.

=== Skyscraper dormitories ===
Skyscraper dormitories, termed dormitowers, have included the Fenwick Tower at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, built in 1971, the Sky Plaza in Leeds, UK, built in 2009, and the Chapter Spitalfields in London, built in 2010, all of which held the title of the world&#x27;s tallest purely student accommodation building when built. Some taller buildings include student accommodation among other uses, including the Het Strijkijzer in The Hague, Netherlands, the Roosevelt Tower at Roosevelt University in Chicago, and the Capri at Marymount Manhattan College in New York. The 33 Beekman Street tower at Pace University in New York, completed in 2015, is also claimed to be the worlds tallest college residence, at . Altus House in Leeds, UK, built in 2021, is described as the tallest student accommodation building in northern Europe at .

The proposed Munger Hall dormitory at the University of California, Santa Barbara would have been the largest university dormitory in the world with 4,500 students over 12 floors. The building, nicknamed &quot;Dormzilla&quot;, was cancelled in 2023 after controversy over the design, including that 94% of the rooms would be windowless and that there were only two exits.

=== Hall councils and staffing ===

==== Hall councils ====
At some institutes, each residence hall has its own hall council. Where they exist, such individual councils are usually part of a larger organization called, variously, residence hall association, resident students&#x27; association, or junior common room committee which typically provides funds and oversees the individual building council. In the US, these student-led organizations are typically connected at a national level by the National Association of College and University Residence Halls. Collectively, these hall councils plan social and educational events, and voice student needs to their respective administration.

==== Staffing ====
In the United States, university residence halls are normally staffed by a combination of both students and professional residence life staff. Student staff members, Resident Assistants, or community advisers act as liaisons, counselors, mediators and policy enforcers. The student staff is supervised by a graduate student or a full-time residence life professional, sometimes known as the hall director. Staff members frequently arrange programming activities to help residents learn about social and academic life during their college life.

In the United Kingdom, halls often run a similar setup to that in the U.S, although the resident academic responsible for the hall is known by the term of &quot;warden&quot; and may be supported by a team of vice-wardens, sub-wardens or senior-members; forming the SCR (Senior Common Room). These are often students or academic staff at the relevant university/college. Many UK halls also have a JCR (Junior Common Room) committee, usually made up of second year students who stayed in that hall during their first year.

The facilities in the hall are often managed by an individual termed the Bursar. Residence Halls may have housekeeping staff to maintain the cleanliness of common rooms including lobbies, corridors, lounges, and bathrooms. Students are normally required to maintain the cleanliness of their own rooms and private or semi-private bathrooms, when offered.

== Other dormitories ==
=== Military dormitories ===
At most U.S. military installations, dormitories have replaced barracks. Much new construction includes private bathrooms, but most unaccompanied housing still features bathrooms between pairs of rooms. Traditional communal shower facilities, typically one per floor, are now considered substandard and are being phased out.

U.S. military dormitory accommodations are generally intended for two junior enlisted single personnel per room, although in most cases this is slowly being phased out in favor of single occupancy in accordance with newer Department of Defense standards.

All branches of the U.S. military except the Air Force still refer to these dormitory-style accommodations as &quot;barracks&quot;. The Air Force, in contrast, refers to all unaccompanied housing as &quot;dormitories&quot;, including open-bay barracks used for basic training that house dozens per room, as well as unaccompanied housing for senior ranking personnel, which resemble apartments and are only found in a select number of overseas locations.

=== Sleeping dormitories ===
In the US, China, UK, Ireland and Canada, a dormitory usually refers to a room containing more than one bed. Examples are found in British boarding schools and many rooming houses such as hostels. CADs, or cold-air dormitories, are found in multi-level rooming houses such as fraternities, sororities, and cooperative houses. In CADs and in hostels, the room typically has very few furnishings except for beds. Such rooms can contain anywhere from three to 50 beds (though such very large dormitories are rare except perhaps as military barracks). Such rooms provide little or no privacy for the residents, and very limited storage for personal items in or near the beds. Cold-air dorms get their names from the common practice of keeping the windows open year-round, even in winter. The practice emerged based on the theory that circulation and cold air minimizes the spread of disease. Some communal bedrooms keep the name &quot;cold-air dorms&quot; or &quot;cold dorms&quot; despite having modern heating or cooling.

=== Company dormitories ===

While the practice of housing employees in company-owned dormitories has dwindled, several companies continue this practice in the U.S. and other countries.

Cast members in the Disney College Program at the Walt Disney World Resort have the opportunity to meet and live with other cast members within their housing complexes in Lake Buena Vista, FL. In the Netherlands, the law forbids companies to offer housing to their employees, because the government wants to prevent people who have just lost their job adding to their stressful situation by having to search for new housing. In Japan, many of the larger companies as well as some of the ministries still offer to their newly graduated freshmen a room in a dormitory. A room in such a dormitory often comes with a communal cook (for the men) or rooms with furnished kitchen blocks (for the women). Usually the employees pay a very small amount of money to enable the men (especially) to save money to buy a house when they get married.

=== Prison dormitories ===
Housing units in prisons that house more than the one or two inmates normally held in cells are referred to as &quot;dormitories&quot; as well. Housing arrangements can vary widely. In some cases, dormitories in low-security prisons may almost resemble their academic counterparts, with the obvious differences of being locked at night, being administered by jailers, and subject to stricter institutional rules and fewer amenities. In other institutions, dormitories may be large rooms, often converted from other purposes such as gymnasiums in response to overcrowding, in which hundreds of prisoners have bunks and lockers.

=== Boarding school dormitories ===
Boarding schools generally have dormitories as resident halls at least for junior or younger children around age 4 to 9 years of age. In classic British boarding schools these typically have bunk beds that have traditionally come to be associated with boarding schools. The Department for Children, Schools and Families, in conjunction with the Department of Health of the United Kingdom, has prescribed guidelines for dormitories in boarding schools. These regulations come under what is called as the National Boarding Standards.

The National Boarding Standards have prescribed a minimum floor area or living space required for each student and other aspects of basic facilities. The minimum floor area of a dormitory accommodating two or more students is defined as the number of students sleeping in the dormitory multiplied by 4.2 m2, plus 1.2 m2. A minimum distance of 0.9 m should also be maintained between any two beds in a dormitory, bedroom or cubicle. If students have individual sleeping cubicles, each student must be provided with a window and a minimum floor area of 5.0 m2. A bedroom for a single student should have a floor area of at least 6.0 m2 and have a window. Sleeping accommodation should be separated by age group and gender. Dormitories should also provide a shower or bath for each ten students and a toilet or urinal for each five students.

===Floating dormitories===

A floating dormitory is a water-borne vessel that provides, as its primary function, living quarters for students enrolled at an educational institution. A floating dormitory functions as a conventional land-based dormitory in all respects except that the living quarters are aboard a floating vessel. A floating dormitory is most often moored in place near the host educational facility and is not used for water transport. Dormitory ships may also refer to vessels that provide water-borne housing in support of non-academic enterprises such as off-shore oil drilling operations. Other vessels containing living quarters for students as ancillary support to the vessel&#x27;s primary function – such as for providing maritime or other training given aboard the vessel – are more appropriately categorized as training ships.

Notable among floating dormitories is SS &quot;Stevens&quot;, a 473-foot, 14,893-ton ship operated by Stevens Institute of Technology, a technological university, in Hoboken, New Jersey. From 1968 to 1975, &quot;Stevens&quot; served as the floating dormitory for as many as 150 students of the institute.

<text>Shen Dao () was an early to mid Warring states period Chinese philosopher and writer. Noteworthy as a predecessor to both Han Fei and Daoism, his remaining fragments are the most substantial of any Jixia Academy scholar, and may have been well known. Early remembered modernly for his influence on the Han Feizi with regards the concept of &quot;shi&quot; (, circumstantial advantage or authority), most of his work would appear to have concerned the concept of &quot;fa&quot; (administrative methods and standards) commonly shared by others that the Han Confucian archivists classified as Legalist.

In his time, Shen Dao was more concerned with &quot;having&quot; laws, and argues the value of bad laws over no laws for the sake of stability. However, he is otherwise more focused on administration, and can historically be compared more with administrator Shen Buhai than the legalistic Shang Yang. Xun Kuang takes Shen Buhai as more focused on power, and Shen Dao more focused on fa, but neither may have been familiar with Shang Yang. Although discussing reward and punishment, Shen Dao advocates their distribution more through impartial administrative mechanisms or &quot;standards&quot; (fa) than laws.

==Text==
Thompson states that the &quot;Shenzi&quot; was available until the fall of the Tang dynasty, though not in its original edition. Shen Dao&#x27;s own original 42 essays have been lost. With only 7 fragments still extant, he is known largely through short references and the writings of others, notably the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. A critical reconstruction of the lost &quot;Shenzi&quot; was made by Paul Thompson, and published in 1979 as &quot;The Shen Tzu Fragments&quot;.

In 2007, the Shanghai Museum published a collection of texts written on bamboo slips from the state of Chu dating to the Warring States period, including six bamboo slips with sayings of Shenzi. These are the only known examples of the text of Shenzi that are contemporaneous with its composition.

Xun Kuang considered Shen&#x27;s style grandiose.

==Theoretical chronology==

Usually referred to as &quot;Shenzi&quot; ( &#x27;Master Shen&#x27;) for his writings, very little is known of Shen Dao&#x27;s life. Herrlee G. Creel believed he was a younger contemporary of Shen Buhai. An itinerant philosopher from the state of Zhao, Knechtges places him about 350 BC, travelling to the city of Linzi (modern Zibo in Shandong) in 300 BC to become a member of the Jixia Academy. He probably left Linzi after its capture by the state of Yan in 285 BC. Julia Ching speculated that he may have been familiar with Shen Buhai, as Xun Kuang was later.

Although Shen Dao would be younger than Shen Buhai by these datings, Ban Gu argued that Shen Dao influenced both Shen Buhai and Han Fei. Although this could just be an example of later Han dynasty glossing, it is not without theoretical merit. The Han Feizi also places Shen Dao before Shang Yang and Shen Buhai in the outer chapters, saying that Shen Dao is worth discussing at least &quot;for mediocre rulers.&quot; On a technical level, Shen Dao&#x27;s administrative ideas are arguably less complex than Shen Buhai&#x27;s, and could represent an earlier strain of thought.

===Shen Dao and Laozi===
Taking Shen Dao as a relevant background for the Tao Te Ching (Laozi), Chad Hansen (of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Daoism) viewed Shen Dao&#x27;s morally neutral naturalism as a development of the type of thinking seen in Mencius and early Mohists. Later Mohists moved away from an emphasis on heaven or nature. Shen Dao &quot;begins&quot; to emphasize a concept of Dao or Way over nature.

Less metaphysical in practice, and more concerned with the practical human world than the &quot;inner workings of heaven and earth&quot;, translator Harris still takes his &#x27;naturalism&#x27; as developing in the direction of that of the Tao te Ching or Huang-Lao typified texts. Not focusing on the idea of Dao in a cosmic sense in his fragments, Shen Dao nonetheless espouses a &quot;Way (Dao) of Heaven.&quot;

Whichever came first, Shen Dao and Laozi are at least partly comparable, including concepts of rule by wu wei or reduced activity of the ruler, as illustrated by translator Emerson. Xun Kuang also later &quot;stresses the indifference of Heaven and Earth to human concerns.&quot;

==Zhuangzi proto-Daoism==
Making use of the term &quot;Dao&quot; without cosmological or metaphysical reference, the Shenzi serves as noteworthy precursor to both Daoism and Han Fei. Posthumously, he is also sometimes classified as Taoist.

Although the Han Feizi would generally be considered authoritarian, figures like Shen Dao were not necessarily more authoritarian for their time. Advocating reliance on administrative machinery (fa) to impartially determine rewards and punishments, Shen Dao otherwise advocates that the realm be literally modeled off the natural world.

The Zhuangzi takes his &quot;fundamental&quot; principle as the &quot;equality of all things&quot;, and Wang Fuzhi speculated that its chapter on &quot;Seeing Things as Equal&quot; was actually written by Shen Dao. As opposed to the egoist Yang Zhu, Shen Dao is characterized by the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; as impartial and lacking selfishness, his great way embracing all things.

Benjamin I. Schwartz early work characterized Shen Dao&#x27;s convictions as Daoisticly indifferent, likening him to the &#x27;inert passive clod&#x27; described in the last chapters of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, seeing the impersonal structure of political authority and human society as expressions of the spontaneous Dao in human civilization. Shen Dao rejects individual judgment, moral agents, sages, and, like other figures of the &quot;fa school&quot;, the &quot;subjective intentionality of noble men.&quot; By contrast, Han Fei does not completely disregard the role of great men.

Schwarz speculated that Shen Dao&#x27;s philosophy similarly involves a ruler free from the turbulence of emotion or moral responsibility. However, Shen Dao has still modernly been argued to be at least &quot;not fully untethered from a moral grounding.&quot;

===Relying on circumstances (shi)===
Shi is a not historically simply a Legalist or Totalitarian idea: before Han Fei, Mencius also discusses Shi. Arguably, it includes ideas that can traced back to philosophical founders like Confucius and Mozi. The Han Feizi&#x27;s Chapter 36 quotes a halberd-and-shield parable from the Zhuangzi, recalling it in support of Chapter 40&#x27;s discussion of Shen Dao.
Although discussing Shen Dao in relation to power, Shen Dao&#x27;s &quot;shi&quot; was not a naked concept of power, but one based in &quot;relying on circumstances&quot;, which fits right in with the Zhuangzi&#x27;s discussion of him. Both discussions of him use the same kind of imagery of being &quot;tossed&quot; or &quot;driven&quot; by the wind.

Shen Dao&#x27;s fragments also include illustrations of relying on water, which translator Harris takes as &quot;reminding us&quot; that the natural world has recognizable &quot;qualities and patterns&quot;, whose actions can be predicted once understood.

Shen Dao might have influenced a later chapter of the Book of Lord Shang, though there is not enough evidence to demonstrate its discussion of shi came from him.

==Relation with Confucianism==
Although the Zhuangzi takes Shen Dao as rejecting sages and lacking in &quot;standards of conduct&quot;, he was otherwise content to leave questions of li (rites) to custom. Mencius advocated that Emperor Shun would run away with his father if he had committed murder, rather than see him arrested. Like Mencius, Shen Dao still upheld filial piety even if the parents are bad, but instead suggests that parents can be reproached if it might save them from disaster. Not considering Confucian values like filial piety sufficient for governing the state, Shen Dao advocates the ruler encourage faith in rules by acting according to rules, and not abandon the throne to help murderous family members escape.

Taking his opponents as &quot;beclouded&quot; by particular aspects of the Way, Xun Kuang criticizes Shen Dao in particular as obsessed with the emulation of models (fa) rather than the employment of worthy men, and that he does not necessarily decide on one model as correct. Shen Dao was more concerned that there be laws than with their particulars. Xun Kuang is of the opinion that his laws (or models) lack &#x27;proper foundations&#x27;, and will not be successful in ordering the state. But Xun Kuang doesn&#x27;t oppose him just for advocating fa models or laws. Xun Kuang also discusses fa. Rather than law itself, Xun Kuang opposes litigation and paradoxes, as found in the school of names.

==Statecraft==

A.C. Graham characterized Shen Dao as a theoretician of centralized power. He espouses an impersonal administration in much the same sense as Shen Buhai, and in contrast with Shang Yang emphasizes the use of talent and the promotion of ministers, saying that order and chaos are &quot;not the product of one man&#x27;s efforts.&quot; He also argued for Wu wei, or the non action of the ruler, along the same lines as Shen Buhai, saying
However he challenges the Confucian and Mohist esteem and appointment of worthies as a basis of order, pointing out that talented ministers existed in every age. Taking it upon himself to attempt a new, analytical solution, Shen advocated fairness as a new virtue. Scholar Sugamoto Hirotsugu attributes the concept of Fen, or social resources, later used by the &quot;Guanzi&quot; and &quot;Xunzi&quot;, to Shen, given a &quot;dimensional&quot; difference through Fa (measurement, standards, protocol, administrative method), social relationships (&quot;yin&quot;) and division. Shen Dao eschews appointment by interview in favour of a mechanical distribution (&quot;the basis of fairness&quot;) with the invariable Fa apportioning every person according to their achievement.

The greatest function of &quot;Fa&quot; (&quot;the principle of objective judgement&quot;) is the prevention of selfish deeds and argument. However, doubting its long-term viability Shen did not exclude moral values and accepted (qualified) Confucian Li&#x27;s supplementation of &quot;Fa&quot; and social relationships, though he frames Li in terms of (impersonal) rules.

For this reason he is said to &quot;laugh at men of worth&quot; and &quot;reject sages&quot;, his order relying not on them but on the &quot;Fa&quot;.

Linking &quot;Fa&quot; to the notion of impartial objectivity associated with universal interest, and reframing the language of the old ritual order to fit a universal, imperial and highly bureaucratized state, Shen cautions the ruler against relying on his own personal judgment, contrasting personal opinions with the merit of the objective standard, or fa, as preventing personal judgements or opinions from being exercised. Personal opinions destroy &quot;Fa&quot;, and Shen Dao&#x27;s ruler therefore &quot;does not show favoritism toward a single person.&quot;

Creel believed that Shen had the same sort of administrative idea denoted by Shen Buhai&#x27;s Xing-Ming, he notes that he does not use the term.

==Doctrine of position (&quot;shi&quot;)==
Shen Dao, as the Han Feizi&#x27;s figure for &quot;shi&quot;, may be a later figure than Shang Yang and Shen Buhai. However, used in many areas of Chinese thought, &quot;shi&quot; (situational advantage) probably originated in the military field. Diplomats relied on concepts of situational advantage and opportunity, as well as secrecy (which is part Shen Buhai&#x27;s doctrine) long before the ascendency of such concepts as sovereignty or law, and were used by kings wishing to free themselves from the aristocrats. Sun Tzu would go on to incorporate Taoist philosophy of inaction and impartiality, as well as punishment and rewards as systematic measures of organization, recalling Han Fei&#x27;s concepts of power (&quot;shi&quot;) and tactics (&quot;shu&quot;).

On the &quot;shi&quot; of &quot;The Art of War&quot;, relatable to Shen Dao&#x27;s, Henry Kissinger says: &quot;Chinese statesmanship exhibits a tendency to view the entire strategic landscape as part of a single whole... Strategy and statecraft become means of &#x27;combative coexistence&#x27; with opponents. The goal is to maneuver them into weakness while building up one&#x27;s own &quot;shi&quot;, or strategic position.&quot; Kissinger considers the &quot;maneuvering&quot; approach an ideal, but one that ran in contrast to the conflicts of the Qin dynasty.

The older works of Jacques Gernet and A.C. Graham in particular took the &quot;Legalists&quot; as understanding that the power of the state resides in social and political institutions, innovative in their aim to subject the state to them. Like Shen Buhai, Shen Dao largely focused on statecraft (Fa), and Confucian Xun Kuang discusses him in this capacity, never referencing Shen Dao in relation to power. Shen Dao was early remembered for his theories on &quot;shi&quot; (lit. &quot;situational advantage&quot;, but also &quot;power&quot; or &quot;charisma&quot;) because Han Fei references him in this capacity.

===Shen Dao===
Searching out the causes of disorder, Shen Dao observed splits in the ruler&#x27;s authority. Shen Dao&#x27;s theory on power echoes Shen Buhai, referenced by Xun Kuang as its originator, who says &quot;He who (can become) singular decision-maker can become the sovereign of All under Heaven&quot;. Shen Dao&#x27;s theory may otherwise have been borrowed from the &quot;Book of Lord Shang&quot;.

For Shen Dao, &quot;Power&quot; (Shih) refers to the ability to compel compliance requiring no support from its subjects, though it does not preclude this. (Shih&#x27;s) merit is that it prevents people from fighting each other; political authority is justified and essential on this basis. Shen Dao says: &quot;When All under Heaven lacks the single esteemed [person], then there is no way to carry out the principles [of orderly government, li 理]... Hence the Son of Heaven is established for the sake of All under Heaven... All under Heaven is not established for the sake of the Son of Heaven...&quot;

Talent cannot be displayed without power. Shen Dao says: &quot;The flying dragon rides on the clouds and the rising serpent wanders in the mists. But when the clouds disperse and the mists clear up, the dragon and the serpent become the same as the earthworm and the large winged black ant because they have lost what they ride.&quot; Leadership is not a function of ability or merit, but is given by some a process, such as giving a leader to a group. &quot;The ruler of a state is enthroned for the sake of the state; the state is not established for the sake of the prince. Officials are installed for the sake of their offices; offices are not established for the sake of officials...

Usually disregarded by the other figures, Shen Dao considers moral capability useful in terms of authority. If the ruler is inferior but his command is practised, it is because he is able to get support from people. But his ideas otherwise constitute a &quot;direct challenge&quot; to Confucian Virtue. Virtue is unreliable because people have different capacities. Both morality together with intellectual capability are insufficient to rule, while position of authority is enough to attain influence and subdue the worthy, making virtue &quot;not worth going after.&quot;

<text>Laredo International Airport is three miles northeast of downtown Laredo, in Webb County, Texas, United States.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a non-hub &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. The airport sees three airlines with flights to Dallas, Houston, and Las Vegas. In the year ending December 2013, LRD had 102,856 passengers. In 2012, LRD totaled 460,000,612 pounds of cargo.

==History==
The Laredo International Airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces during World War II as Laredo Army Airfield, and by the United States Air Force as Laredo Air Force Base during the Cold War as a pilot training base with T-33 Shooting Star and later T-37 Tweet and T-38 Talon aircraft. The military presence ended in December 1973 as part of a nationwide defense cut back after the Vietnam War. Commercial air service provided by Texas International Airlines (formerly Trans-Texas Airways) was moved from the Laredo Municipal Airport (now closed) to the Laredo International Airport in the summer of 1975. Texas International was then able to upgrade their service from Convair 600 prop aircraft to Douglas DC-9 jets. Since then several other commercial airlines and air freight carriers have used this airfield. 

At the entrance to the airport is the statue &quot;Among Friends There Are No Borders&quot;, designed by Armando Hinojosa of Laredo, which depicts a South Texas vaquero and a Mexican charro sharing a campfire.

==Facilities==
Laredo International Airport covers at an elevation of 508 feet (155 m). It has three runways:

* 18L/36R: 8,236 x 150 ft (2,510 x 46 m), concrete
* 18R/36L: 8,743 x 150 ft (2,665 x 46 m), concrete
* 14/32: 5,927 x 150 ft (1,807 x 46 m), concrete

In the year ending September 30, 2018 the airport had 97,189 aircraft operations, an average of 266 per day: 41% military, 38% general aviation, 13% air taxi and 8% airline. In December 2019, 65 aircraft were based at this airport: 15 single-engine, 15 multi-engine, 20 jet and 15 helicopter.

There is one, two-floor terminal at the Laredo International Airport. The bottom floor has the check-in counters, a gift shop, a restaurant, baggage carousel, rental car desks, and US customs. The airport&#x27;s security checkpoint and four gates, all with jetways, are on the second floor. Free Wi-Fi internet access is available throughout the terminal. Gates 3 and 4 allow direct access to US customs.

LRD sometimes receives diverted flights when severe weather threatens Dallas or Houston.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 31 October 1983, Douglas DC-3C N44896 of FBN Flying Service was destroyed by fire at Laredo International Airport while attempting to take off on a cargo flight to McAllen-Miller International Airport. A fire had developed on board the aircraft during the take-off run, and the crew were unable to extinguish it with the equipment available to them.
*On 28 July 1987, Douglas C-53 N39DT of La Mesa Leasing Inc was damaged beyond economic repair when the port engine failed shortly after take-off on an international cargo flight to Ciudad Camargo Airport, Mexico. The aircraft was overloaded by and the power from the remaining good engine was insufficient to sustain flight. The aircraft stalled and crashed whilst attempting to make an emergency landing back at Laredo. Both crew survived. A post-accident investigation revealed no problems with the failed engine.
*On 18 January 1989, Douglas DC-3 XB-DYP crashed shortly after take-off. The aircraft was on an international cargo flight to Torreón International Airport, Mexico. The cause of the accident was that the cargo was improperly secured and shifted in flight, causing the centre of gravity to move aft.
*On 21 May 2002, Douglas DC-3A XB-JBR of Aero JBR ditched in Lake Casa Blanca, after a double engine failure while performing a touch-and-go at Laredo International Airport. It is reported that one of the engines suffered a propeller overspeed condition. All three crew escaped from the submerged aircraft.
*On 9 November 2010, ZA002, a flight test Boeing 787 made an emergency landing after fire had broken out in its P100 electrical panel.

<doc id="317335" wikidata="Q1072961" url="?curid=317335" title="Earthly Branches">
<text>The Earthly Branches (also called the Terrestrial Branches or the 12-cycle) are a system of twelve ordered symbols used throughout East Asia. They are indigenous to China, and are themselves Chinese characters, corresponding to words with no concrete meaning other than the associated branch&#x27;s ordinal position in the list. Cultural applications of the Branches include a dating system known as the sexagenary cycle, as well as astrology. They are associated with the ten Heavenly Stems in Chinese calendars, and in Taoist practice.

== Overview ==
The twelve Earthly Branches are:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
The branches each have specific names in languages of the Sinosphere—which include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Turkic, Vietnamese, and Mongolian. Branches are commonly used when counting in a manner similar to how letters are used according to their alphabetical ordering. In case of upper-case letters, the radical may be added to the corresponding ordinal to denote an uppercase letter. In addition to the calendar months, each branch has been associated with several distinct cultural categories, including animals and the hours of the day, with some regional variation.

The Earthly Branches are used with the Heavenly Stems in Chinese calendars, and in Taoist practice. Many Chinese calendrical systems have started the new year on the second new moon after the winter solstice.

== History ==
The earliest attested use of the Earthly Branches and Heavenly Stems is in recording cycles of days. The ten Heavenly Stems provided names for the days of the week during the Shang dynasty (). The Branches are at least as old as the Stems, with archaeological evidence suggesting they may actually be older.

There are several theories about the origin of the Earthly Branches prior to the advent of the historical record. One theory is that the Earthly Branches were adapted from observations of the planet Jupiter (), whose orbital period is roughly twelve Earth years long. Jonathan Smith has proposed that the first meanings of the earthly branches, predating the Shang, were phases of the moon, with the Heavenly Stems at that point referring to divisions of the ecliptic. After being adopted as a calendar these would have lost their clear lunar reference, permitting their re-purposing for Jupiter stations.

In the context of Chinese cosmology becoming increasingly sophisticated during the Warring States period (221 BC), the 12-, 10-, and 60-cycles began to be applied to units of time other than days.

== Directions ==

Though Chinese has words for the four cardinal directions, Chinese sailors and astronomers preferred using the 12 directions of the Earthly Branches, analogous to the use of &quot;o&#x27;clock&quot; for directions by English-speaking pilots. Since twelve points were not enough for sailing, 12 midpoints were added. Instead of combining two adjacent direction names, they assigned new names: for the four diagonal directions, appropriate trigram names of &quot;I Ching&quot; were used. For the rest, Heavenly Stems 1–4 and 7–10 were used. According to the five elements theory, east is assigned to wood, and the Stems of wood are and . Thus, they were assigned clockwise to the two adjacent points of the east.

Mariners like Zheng He ( 1405–1433) used 48-point compasses. An additional midpoint was called by a combination of its two closest basic directions, such as (; 172.5°), the midpoint between (; 165°) and (; 180°).

<text>Jack Brooks Regional Airport , formerly Southeast Texas Regional Airport, is near Port Arthur, Texas, nine miles (14 km) southeast of Beaumont and northeast of Port Arthur. It was [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]] [[Airport]], but its name was changed to honor former U.S. Representative Jack Brooks (D - Beaumont). The airport is southwest of the city of Nederland in unincorporated Jefferson County, and is used for general aviation. Southwest Airlines ended scheduled jet service in 1980 and several other airlines have started and ended service as well including American Eagle, Continental, Delta/Delta Connection and United Express. The latest chapter is the resumption of service by American Eagle for American Airlines to Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW).

==Facilities==
The Jack Brooks Regional Airport covers and has two paved runways: 12/30 is 6,751 x 150 ft (2,058 x 46 m) and 16/34 is 5,071 x 150 ft (1,546 x 46 m).

In the year ending December 31, 2022, the Jack Brooks Regional Airport had 18,894 aircraft operations, average 65 per day: 84% general aviation, 9% air taxi, 5% military, and 2% airline. At that time, 65 aircraft were based at this airport: 41 single-engine, 6 multi-engine, 14 jet aircraft and 4 helicopters.

==Airlines and destinations: past &amp; present==

United Express (Colgan Air) Saab 340 turboprops flew to Houston (IAH) until July 1, 2012, when the airport lost all scheduled passenger air service. United Express then ran bus service to George Bush Intercontinental Airport.

American Airlines announced their American Eagle affiliate would again serve the airport effective February 14, 2013, with flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth. The American Eagle service is currently operated by Envoy Air on behalf of American with Bombardier CRJ700 regional jets.

===Past airline service===

Soon after the Jack Brooks Regional airport was built, BPT was a stop on the Houston-New Orleans route operated by Eastern Airlines which then ended its mainline service in 1966. Chicago and Southern Air Lines arrived in 1947, and successor Delta Air Lines operated mainline jet service into Beaumont/Port Arthur until 1979.

Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) and successor Texas International Airlines served the Beaumont/Port Arthur area for over 30 years. In the fall of 1949 Houston-based TTa was operating three roundtrip Douglas DC-3 flights a day on a routing of Houston Hobby Airport - Galveston - Beaumont/Port Arthur - Lufkin, TX - Palestine, TX - Dallas Love Field. Eastern Air Lines Convair 440s, Lockheed Constellations and Martin 4-0-4s flew to Houston/Hobby Airport and direct to Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Some Eastern flights continued on to Atlanta; Newark, Boston, Corpus Christi and Brownsville. Delta Air Lines began Convair 440 service in the 1950s flying a Houston Hobby Airport, TX - Beaumont/Port Arthur - Shreveport, LA - Little Rock, AR - Memphis, TN - St. Louis, MO - Chicago Midway Airport, IL routing. Delta inherited the Houston - Chicago route when it merged with Chicago &amp; Southern Airlines with this air carrier operating Douglas DC-3s into Beaumont beginning in 1947.

Six airlines have flown jets to BPT. In the fall of 1966, Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) was operating one daily Douglas DC-9-10 jet flight to Houston Hobby Airport with propeller aircraft flights also being operated to destinations in Texas and Louisiana including Austin, Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby Airport, El Paso, New Orleans and San Antonio by the airline&#x27;s Convair 600 turboprops as well as by Convair 240 and Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft with a total of 17 TTa departures every weekday from the airport. In the summer of 1968, Trans-Texas was operating three daily DC-9 jet flights from BPT with two nonstops to Houston Hobby Airport and one nonstop to Dallas Love Field with all other flights being operated by Convair 600 turboprops with a total of 15 TTa departures every weekday from BPT. By the spring of 1969, Delta Air Lines had introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service with two daily flights, one operating an east and northbound routing of Houston - Beaumont/Port Arthur - Shreveport - Atlanta - New York Newark Airport and the other flight operating a south and westbound routing of New York Kennedy Airport - Atlanta - Shreveport - Beaumont/Port Arthur - Houston. Trans-Texas Airways subsequently changed its name to Texas International Airlines which in turn continued to operate Douglas DC-9-10 jets as well as Convair 600 turboprops to Houston, Dallas and other destinations. According to the February 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Texas International was operating direct DC-9 jet service from Los Angeles (LAX) to Beaumont/Port Arthur via five stops en route including Albuquerque, Roswell, Midland/Odessa, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston. This same OAG also lists daily direct DC-9 jet service operated by Texas International from New Orleans via a stop in Lafayette, LA as well as a daily Boeing 727-200 jet flight operated by Delta flying a New York LaGuardia Airport - Atlanta - Shreveport - Beaumont/Port Arthur - Houston service.

Texas International was then merged into Continental Airlines which in turn continued operating jet service into the airport. In 1979, Southwest Airlines was operating four Boeing 737-200 flights a day nonstop to Dallas Love Field. In July 1983, Continental was flying Boeing 727-100s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop to Houston (IAH). During the mid-1970s, Delta Air Lines was operating Boeing 727-200s as well as McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop to Houston (IAH) and Shreveport as well as direct to Atlanta. Delta Connection, operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA), flew Canadair CRJ-200s to Atlanta and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias to Dallas/Ft. Worth, with the latter service ending when Delta closed their DFW hub in early 2005. ExpressJet operating as Continental Express flew Embraer ERJ-145s to Houston (IAH). American Eagle also served the airport with Convair 580s followed by Saab 340s nonstop to Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) for American Airlines. USAir Express Beechcraft 1900Cs flew nonstop to New Orleans for USAir.

Commuter airlines serving Beaumont/Port Arthur included Metro Airlines with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters and Short 330s nonstop to Houston (IAH) and Short 330s nonstop to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Royale Airlines Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirantes nonstop to Houston (IAH) and direct to New Orleans, Air Texana with nonstop Beechcraft flights to Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) and Dallas Love Field (DAL) as well as nonstop Douglas DC-3s to New Orleans, and Conquest Airlines Beechcraft 1900Cs and Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners nonstop to Austin and Dallas Love Field. Conquest Airlines was based in the Beaumont/Port Arthur area before moving its headquarters to Austin where it started a hub.

In early 1985, the Jack Brooks Regional airport did not have jet service but was served by four different airlines operating a combined total of 41 flights every weekday into BPT. Most of these flights were nonstops from the Houston area with Metro Airlines operating code sharing service as Eastern Express on behalf of Eastern Airlines with eleven flights every weekday from Houston Intercontinental Airport flown with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter commuter aircraft while Royale Airlines was operating code sharing service as Continental Express on behalf of Continental Airlines with nine flights every weekday operated with Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante commuter aircraft also from Houston Intercontinental for a total of 20 flights a day from IAH. At this same time, commuter air carrier Texas Airlines was operating seven nonstop flights every weekday from Houston Hobby Airport with small twin prop Piper Aircraft while Metroflight Airlines operating code sharing service as American Eagle on behalf of American Airlines was operating four flights every weekday nonstop from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport with Convair 580 turboprops which were the largest aircraft serving BPT at this time. By early 1987, Rio Airways was operating &quot;TranStar SkyLink&quot; code sharing service with Beechcraft 1900C commuter propjets on behalf of TranStar Airlines (formerly Muse Air) with ten nonstop flights operated every weekday to Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) where connections were available to TranStar jet service.

==Airline and destination==

==Hurricane Rita==
On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita hit the Beaumont-Port Arthur area. The then-named Southeast Texas Regional Airport passenger terminal had to be shut down with the airport authority then using the old terminal on a temporary basis. The renovated terminal reopened in May 2009 after several delays.

<text>The grey partridge (Perdix perdix) is a bird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds. The scientific name is the Latin for &quot;partridge&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The grey partridge formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao perdix&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but this has been restricted to Sweden. The word &quot;perdix&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;partridge&quot;, from Ancient Greek περδιξ/&quot;perdix&quot; meaning &quot;partridge&quot;. The grey partridge together with the Daurian partridge and the Tibetan partridge are now placed in the genus &quot;Perdix&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson.

===Subspecies===
Eight subspecies are recognised by the IOC World Bird List, though the differences are clinal, and not all are accepted by other authorities; the HBW/BirdLife International list only accepts six subspecies; the differences noted below:
* &quot;P. p. perdix&quot; . Nominate, found in the British Isles and southern Scandinavia to Italy and the Balkans.
* &quot;P. p. armoricana&quot; . Southwestern France.
* &quot;P. p. sphagnetorum&quot; . On peaty soils in the northern part of the Netherlands and northwest Germany. Barely distinct from &quot;P. p. perdix&quot; and included in it by HBW/BLI.
* &quot;P. p. hispaniensis&quot; . Central Pyrenees to northeast Portugal
* &quot;P. p. italica&quot; . Included in &quot;P. p. perdix&quot; by HBW/BLI. Formerly extinct in the wild, now reintroduced.
* &quot;P. p. lucida&quot; . Finland east to the Ural Mountains and south to Black Sea and northern Caucasus.
* &quot;P. p. canescens&quot; . Turkey east to the South Caucasus and northwest Iran.
* &quot;P. p. robusta&quot; . The Ural Mountains to southwestern Siberia and northwestern China. The largest subspecies.

==Description==
The grey partridge is a rotund bird, brown-backed, with grey flanks and chest. The belly is white, usually marked with a large chestnut-brown horse-shoe mark in males, and also in many females. Hens lay up to twenty eggs in a ground nest. The nest is usually in the margin of a cereal field, most commonly winter wheat.

Measurements:
* Length: 
* Wingspan: 
* Weight (&quot;P. p. perdix&quot;): 
* Weight (&quot;P. p. robusta&quot;): 

Males and females are the same size, and very similar in plumage, though the females tend to be slightly duller, and have a smaller dark belly patch. In the hand, the so-called &quot;cross of Lorraine&quot; on the tertiary coverts of females are marked with two transverse bars, as opposed to the one in males. These are present after around 16 weeks of age when the birds have moulted into adult plumage. Young grey partridges are mostly yellow-brown and lack the distinctive face and underpart markings. The song is a harsh, high-pitched &quot;kieerr-ik&quot;. When disturbed, like most gamebirds, it flies a short distance on rounded wings, often calling &quot;rick rick rick&quot; as it rises.

They are a seed-eating species, but the young in particular take insects as an essential protein supply. During the first 10 days of life, the young can only digest insects. The parents lead their chicks to the edges of cereal fields, where they can forage for insects.

==Distribution==
Widespread and common throughout much of its range, the grey partridge is evaluated as &quot;of Least Concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, it has suffered a serious decline in the UK, and in 2015 appeared on the &quot;Birds of Conservation Concern&quot; Red List. This partridge breeds on farmland across most of Europe and across the western Palearctic as far as southwestern Siberia; it is a non-migratory terrestrial species, and forms flocks of up to 30 outside of the breeding season.

It has been introduced widely as a gamebird into Canada, United States, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. A popular gamebird in large areas of North America, it is sometimes known there as &quot;Hungarian partridge&quot; or just &quot;hun&quot;.

==Status and conservation==
Though common and not threatened, it is declining in numbers in some areas of intensive cultivation such as the United Kingdom, due to a loss of breeding habitat and insecticides harming insect numbers, an important food source for the species. Their numbers have fallen in these areas by as much as 85% in the last 25 years. Efforts are being made in the United Kingdom by organizations such as the Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust to halt this decline by creating conservation headlands.

In 1995, it was nominated a Biodiversity action plan (BAP) species. In Ireland, it is now virtually confined to the Lough Boora reserve in County Offaly where a recent conservation project has succeeded in boosting its numbers to around 900, raising hopes that it may be reintroduced to the rest of Ireland.

<text>The Mawangdui Silk Texts () are Chinese philosophical and medical works written on silk which were discovered at the Mawangdui site in Changsha, Hunan, in 1973. They include some of the earliest attested manuscripts of existing texts (such as the &quot;I Ching&quot;), two copies of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, a copy of &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot;, works by Gan De and Shi Shen, and previously unknown medical texts such as &quot;Wushi&#x27;er Bingfang&quot; (&quot;Prescriptions for Fifty-Two Ailments&quot;). Scholars arranged them into 28 types of silk books. Their approximately 120,000 words cover military strategy, mathematics, cartography, and the six classical arts: ritual, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic.

==Overview==
The texts were buried in tomb number three at Mawangdui (which was sealed in 168 BC), and were hidden until their late-20th-century discovery. Some were previously known only by title, and others are previously unknown commentaries on the &quot;I Ching&quot;. In general, they follow the same sequence as the received versions, which were passed down by copying and recopying texts collected and collated during the fifth century AD. However, in some important aspects they differ noticeably from the received texts known before their discovery.

===&quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;===

Most received versions of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; are in substantial agreement. Occasionally two versions will have a homonym, and a third text with a character which is a synonym for one of the first two characters is useful.

There are two Mawangdui Laozi texts, namely A (甲; written in earlier small seal script) and B (乙; written in later clerical script). Texts A and B were copied at different times, with A being the earlier text, although both may be derived from the same parent text. Both Mawangdui texts place the &quot;de&quot; section (chapters 38–81) before the &quot;dao&quot; section (chapters 1–37), whereas the received text places the &quot;dao&quot; section first.

D. C. Lau and Robert G. Henricks have made new translations of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; based on the silk text, largely ignoring the received texts, although Henricks&#x27; translation compares received versions with the text found in the tomb. In 1990, sinologist Victor H. Mair translated the Ma-wang-tui version; Mair considered this earliest-known version (by 500 years) more authentic than the most commonly translated texts. The two silk books are part of the Cultural Relics from the Mawangdui Tombs collection at the Hunan Provincial Museum.

===Jargon===
The Chinese characters in the silk texts are often only fragments of the characters used in later traditional versions. Many characters are formed by combining two simpler characters: one indicating a general category of meaning, and the other to guide pronunciation. Where the traditional texts have both components, the silk texts frequently give only the phonetic half of the character. There are several hypotheses to explain this:
* The scribe may have been too lazy to write the full form of many characters.
* The earlier of two silk texts (or the text from which it was copied) may have been a scribe taking dictation as quickly as they could write. The scribe wrote down the part of each character that indicates its pronunciation, with the intention of later recopying the text with the appropriate meaning components for the abbreviated characters.
* In English, &quot;dog&quot; has two apparently-unrelated meanings: a carnivorous mammal, or to pursue with unflagging patience. English speakers do not write &quot;dog (the mammal)&quot;, even in the sentence &quot;The feral dog dogged the human invaders of its territory until they eventually left the area&quot;. A similar understanding may have been assumed in the ancient writings.
* It may have been a form of jargon; similar writing of partial characters are found in ancient Chinese musical (pipa, guqin and guzheng) scores. Partial characters and their derivatives are building blocks for the writing systems of some historical (such as Khitan and Tangut) and modern languages, such as Japanese.

In addition to partial characters mentioned above, the two-silk texts sometimes use characters different from those in later versions. This is similar to the English &quot;She flowered the table&quot; compared with &quot;She floured the table&quot;, and the older version provides insight into a text&#x27;s original meaning.

<text>An arborist, or (less commonly) arboriculturist, is a professional in the practice of arboriculture, which is the cultivation, management, and study of individual trees, shrubs, vines, and other perennial woody plants in dendrology and horticulture.

Arborists generally focus on the health and safety of individual plants and trees, rather than managing forests or harvesting wood (silviculture or forestry). An arborist&#x27;s scope of work is therefore distinct from that of either a forester or a logger.

==Scope of work==

In order for arborists to work near power wires, either additional training is required or they need to be certified as a Qualified Line Clearance Arborist or Utility Arborist (there may be different terminology for various countries). There is a variety of minimum distances that must be kept from power wires depending on voltage, however the common distance for low voltage lines in urban settings is 10 feet (about 3 metres).

Arborists who climb (as not all do) can use a variety of techniques to ascend into the tree. The least invasive, and most popular technique used is to ascend on rope. There are two common methods of climbing, Single Rope System (SRS) and Moving Rope System (MRS). When personal safety is an issue, or the tree is being removed, arborists may use &#x27;spikes&#x27;, (also known as &#x27;gaffs&#x27; or &#x27;spurs&#x27;) attached to their chainsaw boots with straps to ascend and work. Spikes wound the tree, leaving small holes where each step has been.

An arborist&#x27;s work may involve very large and complex trees, or ecological communities and their abiotic components in the context of the landscape ecosystem. These may require monitoring and treatment to ensure they are healthy, safe, and suitable to property owners or community standards. This work may include some or all of the following: planting; transplanting; pruning; structural support; preventing, or diagnosing and treating phytopathology or parasitism; preventing or interrupting grazing or predation; installing lightning protection; and removing vegetation deemed as hazardous, an invasive species, a disease vector, or a weed.

Arborists may also plan, consult, write reports and give legal testimony. While some aspects of this work are done on the ground or in an office, much of it is done by arborists who perform tree services and who climb the trees with ropes, harnesses and other equipment. Lifts and cranes may be used too. The work of all arborists is not the same. Some may just provide a consulting service; others may perform climbing, pruning and planting: whilst others may provide a combination of all of these services.

==Qualifications==
Arborists gain qualifications to practice arboriculture in a variety of ways and some arborists are more qualified than others. Experience working safely and effectively in and around trees is essential. Arborists tend to specialize in one or more disciplines of arboriculture, such as diagnosis and treatment of pests, diseases and nutritional deficiencies in trees, climbing and pruning, cabling and lightning protection, or consultation and report writing. All these disciplines are related to one another and some arborists are very well experienced in all areas of tree work, however not all arborists have the training or experience to properly practice every discipline.

Arborists choose to pursue formal certification, which is available in some countries and varies somewhat by location. An arborist who holds certification in one or more disciplines may be expected to participate in rigorous continuing education requirements to ensure constant improvement of skills and techniques.

In Australia, arboricultural education and training are streamlined countrywide through a multi-disciplinary vocational education, training, and qualification authority called the Australian Qualifications Framework, which offers varying levels of professional qualification. Government institutions including Technical and Further Education TAFE offer Certificate III or a diploma in arboriculture as well as some universities. There are also many private institutions covering similar educational framework in each state. Recognition of prior learning is also an option for practicing arborists with 10 or more years of experience with no prior formal training. It allows them to be assessed and fast track their certification.

In France, a qualified arborist must hold a &quot;Management of Ornamental Trees&quot; certificate, and a qualified arborist climber must hold a &quot;Pruning and Care of Trees&quot; certificate; both delivered by the French Ministry of Agriculture.

In the UK, an arborist can gain qualifications up to and including a master&#x27;s degree. College-based courses include further education qualifications, such as national certificate, national diploma, while higher education courses in arboriculture include foundation degree, bachelor&#x27;s degree and master&#x27;s degree.

In the US, a Certified Arborist (CA) is a professional who has over three years of documented and verified experience and has passed a rigorous written test from the International Society of Arboriculture. Other designations include Municipal Specialist, Utility Specialist and Board Certified Master Arborist (BCMA). The USA and Canada additionally have college-based training which, if passed, will give the certificate of Qualified Arborist. The Qualified Arborist can then be used to offset partial experience towards the Certified Arborist.

Tree Risk Assessment Qualified credential (TRAQ), designed by the International Society of Arboriculture, was launched in 2013. At that time people holding the TRACE credential were transferred over to the TRAQ credential.

In Canada, there are provincially governed apprenticeship programs that allow arborists&#x27; to work near power lines upon completion. These apprenticeship programs must meet the provincial reregulations (For example, in B.C. they must meet WorkSafeBC G19.30), and individuals must ensure they meet the requirements of the owner of the power system.

==Cultural practices==

Trees in urban landscape settings are often subject to disturbances, whether human or natural, both above and below ground. They may require care to improve their chances of survival following damage from either biotic or abiotic causes. Arborists can provide appropriate solutions, such as pruning trees for health and good structure, for aesthetic reasons, and to permit people to walk under them (a technique often referred to as &quot;crown raising&quot;), or to keep them away from wires, fences and buildings (a technique referred to as &quot;crown reduction&quot;). Timing and methods of treatment depend on the species of tree and the purpose of the work. To determine the best practices, a thorough knowledge of local species and environments is essential.

There can be a vast difference between the techniques and practices of professional arborists and those of inadequately trained tree workers. Some commonly offered &quot;services&quot; are considered unacceptable by modern arboricultural standards and may seriously damage, disfigure, weaken, or even kill trees. One such example is tree topping, lopping, or &quot;hat-racking&quot;, where entire tops of trees or main stems are removed, generally by cross-cutting the main stem(s) or leaders, leaving large unsightly stubs. Trees that manage to survive such treatment are left prone to a spectrum of detrimental effects, including vigorous but weakly attached regrowth, pest susceptibility, pathogen intrusion, and internal decay.

Pruning should only be done with a specific purpose in mind. Every cut is a wound, and every leaf lost is removal of photosynthetic potential. Proper pruning can be helpful in many ways, but should always be done with the minimum amount of live tissue removed.

In recent years, research has proven that wound dressings such as paint, tar or other coverings are unnecessary and may harm trees. The coverings may encourage growth of decay-causing fungi. Proper pruning, by cutting through branches at the right location, can do more to limit decay than wound dressing 

Chemicals can be applied to trees for insect or disease control through soil application, stem injections or spraying. Compacted or disturbed soils can be improved in various ways.

Arborists can also assess trees to determine the health, structure, safety or feasibility within a landscape and in proximity to humans. Modern arboriculture has progressed in technology and sophistication from practices of the past. Many current practices are based on knowledge gained through recent research, including that of Alex Shigo, considered one &quot;father&quot; of modern arboriculture.

== Legal issues ==
Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be a number of legal issues surrounding the practices of arborists, including boundary issues, public safety issues, &quot;heritage&quot; trees of community value, and &quot;neighbour&quot; issues such as ownership, obstruction of views, impacts of roots crossing boundaries, nuisance problems, disease or insect quarantines, and safety of nearby trees or plants that may be affected.

Arborists are frequently consulted to establish the factual basis of disputes involving trees, or by private property owners seeking to avoid legal liability through the duty of care. Arborists may be asked to assess the value of a tree in the process of an insurance claim for trees damaged or destroyed, or to recover damages resulting from tree theft or vandalism. In cities with tree preservation orders an arborist&#x27;s evaluation of tree hazard may be required before a property owner may remove a tree, or to assure the protection of trees in development plans and during construction operations. Carrying out work on protected trees and hedges is illegal without express permission from local authorities, and can result in legal action including fines. Homeowners who have entered into contracts with a Homeowner&#x27;s association (see also Restrictive covenants) may need an arborists&#x27; professional opinion of a hazardous condition prior to removing a tree, or may be obligated to assure the protection of the views of neighboring properties prior to planting a tree or in the course of pruning. Arborists may be consulted in forensic investigations where the evidence of a crime can be determined within the growth rings of a tree, for example. Arborists may be engaged by one member of a dispute in order to identify factual information about trees useful to that member of the dispute, or they can be engaged as an expert witness providing unbiased scientific knowledge in a court case. Homeowners associations seeking to write restrictive covenants, or legislative bodies seeking to write laws involving trees, may seek the counsel of arborists in order to avoid future difficulties.

Before undertaking works in the UK, arborists have a legal responsibility to survey trees for wildlife, especially bats, which are given particular legal protection. In addition, any tree in the UK can be covered by a tree preservation order and it is illegal to conduct any work on a tree, including deadwooding or pruning, before permission has been sought from the local council.

==Organizations==
*Australia Limited, a non-profit organisation, is a national organisation promoting and representing tree workers, arborists, professional tree management and urban forestry throughout Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. 
*The Tree Care Industry Association (formerly the National Arborist Association) is a public and professional non-profit organization for the arboriculture field. It has more than 2,000 member companies representing over a dozen countries. TCIA&#x27;s Accreditation program certifies that tree care companies that have been inspected and accredited based on adherence to industry standards for performance and safety; maintenance of trained, professional staff; and dedication to ethics and quality in business practices. In addition, they provide safety and educational programs, guidelines for tree service operations, ANSI A300 tree pruning standards, and consumer resources.
*The International Society of Arboriculture, a non-profit organization, maintains a list of ISA Certified Arborists who have passed a written exam and demonstrated a basic level of knowledge in arboriculture. There are also additional classifications of certified arborists with Certified Arborist/Utility Specialist for those who work near power lines, and Certified Arborist/Municipal Specialist for those who deal mostly with community trees. Other certifications exist for Certified Tree Workers, and the highest level of certification, the Board Certified Master Arborist.
*The American Society of Consulting Arborists is an organization whose membership is exclusive to those with a certain level of industry experience, plus higher educational experience or continuing education; some members may achieve a higher status by fulfilling the requirements to become a Registered Consulting Arborist. Consulting arborists generally specialize in the areas of ethics, law, land planning and development, and tree valuation, among others. Consulting arborists are often called on for legal testimony and report writing in various instances where a particular authority on trees is necessary for consequent actions.
*In the UK, the professional body representing the sector is the Institute of Chartered Foresters. The trade body representing arborists is the Arboricultural Association. The association maintains a register of consultants who have demonstrated a high level of technical arboricultural knowledge, and operate an Approved Contractor scheme. This scheme assesses both the technical competence and business practices of arboricultural contractors.
*The European Arboricultural Council is a European group of multiple arboriculture organizations from various countries.
* Plant Amnesty is a public education and advocacy group, based in Seattle, dedicated to promoting proper pruning methods. Founded in 1987, Plant Amnesty became an international resource for arborists and their clients in the mid-1990s.

==In literature==
The protagonist in Italo Calvino&#x27;s novel &quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot; lives life on the ground as a boy and spends the rest of his life swinging from tree to tree in the Italian countryside. As a young man he helps the local fruit farmers by pruning their trees.

==Notable arborists==
Some noteworthy arborists include: 
* Francis A. Bartlett – founded The Bartlett Tree Experts Co., the world&#x27;s leading scientific tree and shrub care company in 1907.
* John Chapman – pioneering U.S. frontier nurseryman and orchardist, commonly known as &quot;Johnny Appleseed.&quot;
* Canopy Cat Rescue – rescues domestic cats from tall trees; appears on &quot;Treetop Cat Rescue&quot;.
* Sebastian Junger – author of &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; and &quot;War.&quot; Previous to becoming a journalist, Sebastian was an arborist in Massachusetts.
* Chuck Leavell – two-time recipient of the Georgia Tree Farmer of the Year award, and author of the children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Tree Farmer.&quot; In 2006 Leavell was appointed by Governor Sonny Perdue to the Georgia Land Conservation Council. He is also an accomplished jazz pianist and keyboardist for &quot;the Rolling Stones.&quot;
* Alex Shigo – considered the father of modern arboriculture.
* David Mitchell - Devon born tree inspector and veteran tree expert

<text>Sir James George Frazer (; 1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941) was a Scottish social anthropologist and folklorist influential in the early stages of the modern studies of mythology and comparative religion.

==Personal life==
Frazer was born on 1 January 1854 in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Katherine Brown and Daniel F. Frazer, a chemist. He attended school at Springfield Academy and Larchfield Academy in Helensburgh. He studied at the University of Glasgow and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with honours in classics (his dissertation was published years later as &quot;The Growth of Plato&#x27;s Ideal Theory&quot;) and remained a Classics Fellow all his life. From Trinity, he went on to study law at the Middle Temple, but never practised.

Four times elected to Trinity&#x27;s Title Alpha Fellowship, he was associated with the college for most of his life, except for the year 1907–1908, spent at the University of Liverpool. He was knighted in 1914, and a public lectureship in social anthropology at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Glasgow and Liverpool was established in his honour in 1921. He was, if not blind, then severely visually impaired from 1930 on. He and his wife, Lilly, died in Cambridge, England, within a few hours of each other. He died on 7 May 1941. They are buried at the St Giles aka Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.

Frazer is commonly interpreted as an atheist in light of his criticism of Christianity and especially Roman Catholicism in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;. However, his later writings and unpublished materials suggest an ambivalent relationship with Neoplatonism and Hermeticism.

In 1896 Frazer married Elizabeth &quot;Lilly&quot; Grove, a writer whose father was from Alsace. She would later adapt Frazer&#x27;s &quot;Golden Bough&quot; as a book of children&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Leaves from the Golden Bough&quot;. His sister Isabella Katherine Frazer married the mathematician John Steggall.

==Work==

The study of myth and religion became his areas of expertise. Except for visits to Italy and Greece, Frazer did not widely travel. His prime sources of data were ancient histories and questionnaires mailed to missionaries and imperial officials all over the globe. Frazer&#x27;s interest in social anthropology was aroused by reading E. B. Tylor&#x27;s &quot;Primitive Culture&quot; (1871) and was also encouraged by his friend, the biblical scholar William Robertson Smith, who was comparing elements of the Old Testament with early Hebrew folklore.

Frazer was the first scholar to describe in detail the relations between myths and rituals. His vision of the annual sacrifice of the Year-King has not been borne out by field studies. Yet &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, his study of ancient cults, rites, and myths, including their parallels in early Christianity, continued for many decades to be studied by modern mythographers for its detailed information.

The first edition, in two volumes, was published in 1890; and a second, in three volumes, in 1900. The third edition was finished in 1915 and ran to twelve volumes, with a supplemental thirteenth volume added in 1936. He published a single-volume abridged version, largely compiled by his wife Lady Frazer, in 1922, with some controversial material on Christianity excluded from the text. The work&#x27;s influence extended well beyond the conventional bounds of academia, inspiring the new work of psychologists and psychiatrists. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, cited &quot;Totemism and Exogamy&quot; frequently in his own &quot;Totem and Taboo: Resemblances Between the Psychic Lives of Savages and Neurotics&quot;.

The symbolic cycle of life, death and rebirth which Frazer divined behind myths of many peoples captivated a generation of artists and poets. Perhaps the most notable product of this fascination is T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922).

Frazer&#x27;s pioneering work has been criticised by late-20th-century scholars. For instance, in the 1980s the social anthropologist Edmund Leach wrote a series of critical articles, one of which was featured as the lead in &quot;Anthropology Today&quot;, vol. 1 (1985). Leach criticised &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; for the breadth of comparisons drawn from widely separated cultures, but often based his comments on the abridged edition, which omits the supportive archaeological details. In a positive review of a book narrowly focused on the &quot;cultus&quot; in the Hittite city of Nerik, J. D. Hawkins remarked approvingly in 1973, &quot;The whole work is very methodical and sticks closely to the fully quoted documentary evidence in a way that would have been unfamiliar to the late Sir James Frazer.&quot; More recently, &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; has been criticised for what are widely perceived as imperialist, anti-Catholic, classist and racist elements, including Frazer&#x27;s assumptions that European peasants, Aboriginal Australians and Africans represented fossilised, earlier stages of cultural evolution.

Another important work by Frazer is his six-volume commentary on the Greek traveller Pausanias&#x27; description of Greece in the mid-2nd century AD. Since his time, archaeological excavations have added enormously to the knowledge of ancient Greece, but scholars still find much of value in his detailed historical and topographical discussions of different sites, and his eyewitness accounts of Greece at the end of the 19th century.

===Theories of religion and cultural evolution===
Among the most influential elements of the third edition of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; is Frazer&#x27;s theory of cultural evolution and the place Frazer assigns religion and magic in that theory. Frazer&#x27;s theory of cultural evolution was not absolute and could reverse, but sought to broadly describe three (or possibly, four) spheres through which cultures were thought to pass over time. Frazer believed that, over time, culture passed through three stages, moving from magic, to religion, to science. Frazer&#x27;s classification notably diverged from earlier anthropological descriptions of cultural evolution, including that of Auguste Comte, because he thought magic was both initially separate from religion and invariably preceded religion. He also defined magic separately from belief in the supernatural and superstition, presenting an ultimately ambivalent view of its place in culture.

Frazer believed that magic and science were similar because both shared an emphasis on experimentation and practicality; his emphasis on this relationship is so broad that almost any disproven scientific hypothesis technically constitutes magic under his system. In contrast to both magic and science, Frazer defined religion in terms of belief in personal, supernatural forces and attempts to appease them. As historian of religion Jason Josephson-Storm describes Frazer&#x27;s views, Frazer saw religion as &quot;a momentary aberration in the grand trajectory of human thought.&quot; He thus ultimately proposed – and attempted to further – a narrative of secularization and one of the first social-scientific expressions of a disenchantment narrative.

At the same time, Frazer was aware that both magic and religion could persist or return. He noted that magic sometimes returned so as to become science, such as when alchemy underwent a revival in Early Modern Europe and became chemistry. On the other hand, Frazer displayed a deep anxiety about the potential of widespread belief in magic to empower the masses, indicating fears of and biases against lower-class people in his thought.

==Origin-of-death stories==

Frazer collected stories from throughout the British Empire and devised four general classifications into which many of them could be grouped:

===The Story of the Two Messengers===
This type of story is common in Africa. Two messages are carried from the supreme being to mankind: one of eternal life and one of death. The messenger carrying the tidings of eternal life is delayed, and so the message of death is received first by mankind.

The Bantu people of Southern Africa, such as the Zulu, tell that Unkulunkulu, the Old Old One, sent a message that men should not die, giving it to the chameleon. The chameleon was slow and dawdled, taking time to eat and sleep. Unkulunkulu meanwhile had changed his mind and gave a message of death to the lizard who travelled quickly and so overtook the chameleon. The message of death was delivered first and so, when the chameleon arrived with its message of life, mankind would not hear it and so is fated to die.

Because of this, Bantu people, such as the Ngoni, punish lizards and chameleons. For example, children may be allowed to put tobacco into a chameleon&#x27;s mouth so that the nicotine poisons it and the creature dies, writhing while turning colours.

Variations of the tale are found in other parts of Africa. The Akamba say the messengers are the chameleon and the thrush while the Ashanti say they are the goat and the sheep.

The Bura people of northern Nigeria say that, at first, neither death nor disease existed but, one day, a man became ill and died. The people sent a worm to ask the sky deity, Hyel, what they should do with him. The worm was told that the people should hang the corpse in the fork of a tree and throw mush at it until it came back to life. But a malicious lizard, Agadzagadza, hurried ahead of the worm and told the people to dig a grave, wrap the corpse in cloth, and bury it. The people did this. When the worm arrived and said that they should dig up the corpse, place it in a tree, and throw mush at it, they were too lazy to do this, and so death remained on Earth. This Bura story has the common mythic motif of a vital message which is diverted by a trickster.

In Togoland, the messengers were the dog and the frog, and, as in the Bura version, the messengers go first from mankind to God to get answers to their questions.

===The Story of the Waxing and Waning Moon===

The moon regularly seems to disappear and then return. This gave primitive peoples the idea that man should or might return from death in a similar way. Stories that associate the moon with the origin of death are found especially around the Pacific region. In Fiji, it is said that the moon suggested that mankind should return as he did. But the rat god, &quot;Ra Kalavo&quot;, would not permit this, insisting that men should die like rats. In Australia, the Wotjobaluk aborigines say that the moon used to revive the dead until an old man said that this should stop. The Cham have it that the goddess of good luck used to revive the dead, but the sky-god sent her to the moon so she could not do this any more.

===The Story of the Serpent and His Cast Skin===

Animals which shed their skin, such as snakes and lizards, appeared to be immortal to primitive people. This led to stories in which mankind lost the ability to do this. For example, in Vietnam, it was said that the Jade Emperor sent word from heaven to mankind that, when they became old, they should shed their skins while the serpents would die and be buried. But some snakes overheard the command and threatened to bite the messenger unless he switched the message, so that man would die while snakes would be eternally renewed. For the natives of the island of Nias, the story was that the messenger who completed their creation failed to fast and ate bananas rather than crabs. If he had eaten the latter, then mankind would have shed their skins like crabs and so lived eternally.

===The Story of the Banana===

The banana plant bears its fruit on a stalk which dies after bearing. This gave people such as the Nias islanders the idea that they had inherited this short-lived property of the banana rather than the immortality of the crab. The natives of Poso also based their myth on this property of the banana. Their story is that the creator in the sky would lower gifts to mankind on a rope and, one day, a stone was offered to the first couple. They refused the gift as they did not know what to do with it, so the creator took it back and lowered a banana. The couple ate this with relish, but the creator told them that they would live as the banana, perishing after having children rather than remaining everlasting like the stone.

==Reputation and criticism==
Frazer married in 1896 and his new wife perceived that Frazer&#x27;s reputation was not equal to his abilities. Lilly Frazer had the pushiness that he lacked, and she became his manager and publicist guarding access to his office. He did not care too much for prizes but she valued them. She was particularly involved in publishing his work, where she arranged translation to French, and to children, where she adapted his stories.

According to historian Timothy Larsen, Frazer used scientific terminology and analogies to describe ritual practices, and conflated magic and science together, such as describing the &quot;magic wand of science&quot;. Larsen criticizes Frazer for baldly characterized magical rituals as &quot;infallible&quot; without clarifying that this is merely what believers in the rituals thought. Larsen has said that Frazer&#x27;s vivid descriptions of magical practices were written with the intention to repel readers, but, instead, these descriptions more often allured them.

Larsen also criticizes Frazer for applying western European Christian ideas, theology, and terminology to non-Christian cultures. This distorts those cultures to make them appear more Christian. Frazer routinely described non-Christian religious figures by equating them with Christian ones. Frazer applied Christian terms to functionaries, for instance calling the elders of the Njamus of East Africa &quot;equivalent to the Levites of Israel&quot; and the Grand Lama of Lhasa &quot;the Buddhist Pope... the man-god who bore his people&#x27;s sorrows, the Good Shepherd who laid down his life for the sheep&quot;. He routinely uses the specifically Christian theological terms &quot;born again&quot;, &quot;new birth&quot;, &quot;baptism&quot;, &quot;christening&quot;, &quot;sacrament&quot;, and &quot;unclean&quot; in reference to non-Christian cultures.

When Frazer&#x27;s Australian colleague Walter Baldwin Spencer requested to use native terminology to describe Aboriginal Australian cultures, arguing that doing so would be more accurate, since the Christian terms were loaded with Christian connotations that would be completely foreign to members of the cultures he was describing, Frazer insisted that he should use Abrahamic terms instead, telling him that using native terms would be off-putting and would seem pedantic. A year later, Frazer excoriated Spencer for refusing to equate the non-estrangement of Aboriginal Australian totems with the Christian doctrine of reconciliation. When Spencer, who had studied the aboriginals firsthand, objected that the ideas were not remotely similar, Frazer insisted that they were exactly equivalent. Based on these exchanges, Larsen concludes that Frazer&#x27;s deliberate use of Judeo-Christian terminology in the place of native terminology was not to make native cultures seem less strange, but rather to make Christianity seem more strange and barbaric.

<text>The common quail (Coturnix coturnix), or European quail, is a small ground-nesting game bird in the pheasant family Phasianidae. It is mainly migratory, breeding in the western Palearctic and wintering in Africa and southern India.

With its characteristic call of three repeated chirps (repeated three times in quick succession), this species of quail is more often heard than seen. It is widespread in Europe and North Africa, and is categorised by the IUCN as &quot;least concern&quot;. It should not be confused with the Japanese quail (&quot;Coturnix japonica)&quot;, native to Asia, which, although visually similar, has a call that is very distinct from that of the common quail. Like the Japanese quail, common quails are sometimes kept as poultry.

==Taxonomy==
The common quail was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao coturnix&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;coturnix&quot; is the Latin word for the common quail. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Coturnix&quot; that was introduced in 1764 by the French naturalist François Alexandre Pierre de Garsault. The common quail was formerly considered to be conspecific with the Japanese quail (&quot;Coturnix japonica&quot;). The ranges of the two species meet in Mongolia and near Lake Baikal without apparent interbreeding and in captivity the offspring of crosses show reduced fertility. The Japanese quail is therefore now treated as a separate species.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. c. coturnix&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – breeding in Europe and northwest Africa to Mongolia and north India, wintering in Africa and central, south India
* &quot;C. c. conturbans&quot; Hartert, 1917 – Azores
* &quot;C. c. inopinata&quot; Hartert, 1917 – Cape Verde Islands 
* &quot;C. c. africana&quot; Temminck &amp; Schlegel, 1848 – sub-Saharan Africa and the three islands
* &quot;C. c. erlangeri&quot; Zedlitz, 1912 – east and northeast Africa

==Description==
The common quail is a small compact gallinaceous bird in length with a wingspan of . The weight is . It is greatest before migration at the end of the breeding season. The female is generally slightly heavier than the male. It is streaked brown with a white eyestripe, and, in the male, a white chin. As befits its migratory nature, it has long wings, unlike the typically short-winged gamebirds. According to Online Etymology Dictionary, &quot;small migratory game bird of the Old World, late 14c. (early 14c. as a surname, Quayle), from Old French &quot;quaille&quot; (Modern French &quot;caille&quot;), perhaps via Medieval Latin &quot;quaccula&quot; (source also of Provençal &quot;calha&quot;, Italian &quot;quaglia&quot;, Portuguese &quot;calha&quot;, Old Spanish &quot;coalla&quot;), or directly from a Germanic source (compare Dutch &quot;kwakkel&quot;, Old High German &quot;quahtala&quot;, German &quot;Wachtel&quot;, Old English &quot;wihtel&quot;), imitative of the bird&#x27;s cry. Or the English word might have come up indigenously from Proto-Germanic.&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
This is a terrestrial species, feeding on seeds and insects on the ground. It is notoriously difficult to see, keeping hidden in crops, and reluctant to fly, preferring to creep away instead. Even when flushed, it keeps low and soon drops back into cover. Often the only indication of its presence is the distinctive &quot;wet-my-lips&quot; repetitive song of the male. The call is uttered mostly in the mornings, evenings and sometimes at night. It is a strongly migratory bird, unlike most game birds.

The common quail has been introduced onto the island of Mauritius on several occasions but has failed to establish itself and is now probably extinct.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

Males generally arrive in the breeding area before the females. In northern Europe laying begins from the middle of May, and with repeat laying can continue to the end of August. The female forms a shallow scrape in the ground in diameter which is sparsely lined with vegetation. The eggs are laid at 24-hour intervals to form a clutch of between 8 and 13 eggs. These have an off-white to creamy yellow background with dark brown spots or blotches. Their average dimensions are with a weight of . The eggs are incubated by the female alone beginning after all the eggs are laid. The eggs hatch synchronously after 17–20 days. The young are precocial and shortly after hatching leave the nest and can feed themselves. They are cared for by the female who broods them while they are small. The young fledge when around 19 days of age but stay in the family group for 30–50 days. They generally first breed when one year old and only have a single brood.

==Relationship to humans==

The common quail is heavily hunted as game on passage through the Mediterranean area. Very large numbers are caught in nets along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. It is estimated that in 2012, during the autumn migration, 3.4 million birds were caught in northern Sinai and perhaps as many as 12.9 million in the whole of Egypt.

This species over recent years has seen an increase in its propagation in the United States and Europe. However, most of this increase is with hobbyists. It is declining in parts of its range such as Ireland.

In 1537, Queen Jane Seymour, third wife of Henry VIII, then pregnant with the future King Edward VI, developed an insatiable craving for quail, and courtiers and diplomats abroad were ordered to find sufficient supplies for the Queen.

===Poisoning===
If common quails have eaten certain plants, although which plants is still in debate, the meat from quail can be poisonous, with one in four who consume poisonous flesh becoming ill with coturnism, which is characterized by muscle soreness, and which may lead to kidney failure.

==In culture==
In the Bible, the Book of Numbers chapter 11 describes a story of a huge mass of quails that were blown by a wind and were taken as meat by the Israelites in the wilderness.

<doc id="317362" wikidata="Q188875" url="?curid=317362" title="Leopoldo Lugones">
<text>Leopoldo Antonio Lugones Argüello (13 June 1874 – 18 February 1938) was an Argentine poet, essayist, novelist, playwright, historian, professor, translator, biographer, philologist, theologian, diplomat, politician and journalist. His poetic writings are often considered to be the founding works of Spanish-language modern poetry (not, however, modernismo). His short stories made him a crucial precursor and also a pioneer of both the fantastic and science fiction literature in Argentina.

== Early life ==
Born in Villa de María del Río Seco, a city in Córdoba Province, in Argentina&#x27;s Catholic heartland, Lugones belonged to a family of landed gentry. He was the firstborn son of Santiago M. Lugones and Custodia Argüello. His father, son of Pedro Nolasco Lugones, was returning from the city of Buenos Aires to Santiago del Estero when he met Custodia Argüello while stopping in Villa de María, a locality that was at that time disputed territory between the provinces of Santiago del Estero and Córdoba. It was his mother who gave young Leopoldo his first lessons and was responsible for his strict Catholic upbringing.

When Lugones was six years old and following the birth of a second child, the family moved to the city of Santiago del Estero and later to Ojo de Agua, a small town situated in the south of the province of Santiago del Estero close to the border with Córdoba, where the poet&#x27;s two younger brothers were born: Ramón Miguel Lugones (1880, Santiago del Estero), and the youngest of the four children, Carlos Florencio Lugones (1885, Ojo de Agua). Later his parents sent him to study at the Colegio Nacional de Monserrat, in Córdoba, where his maternal grandmother lived. In 1892 the family would move to that city, at the time when Lugones was beginning his forays into the fields of journalism and literature.

He first worked for &quot;La Montaña&quot;, a newspaper, and was in favour with the aristocratic Manuel Quintana, a candidate to become a president of Argentina. This brought him first to Buenos Aires in 1896, where his literary talent developed quickly.

That year, he married Juana Agudelo, from whom he had a son, Leopoldo &quot;Polo&quot; Lugones, who would become the notorious chief of the Federal Police during the dictatorship of José Félix Uriburu. In 1899, he became an active Freemason.

==Career==
Lugones was the leading Argentine exponent of the Latin American literary current known as Modernismo. This was a form of Parnassianism influenced by Symbolism. He was also the author of the incredibly dense and rich stories of &quot;La Guerra Gaucha&quot; (1905). He was an impassioned journalist, polemicist and public speaker who at first was a Socialist, later a conservative/traditionalist and finally a supporter of Fascism and as such an inspiration for a group of rightist intellectuals such as Juan Carulla and Rodolfo Irazusta.

Leopoldo Lugones went to Europe in 1906, 1911, 1913 and in 1930, in which latter year he supported the coup d&#x27;état against the aging Radical party president, Hipólito Yrigoyen. Between 1924 and 1931, Lugones took part in the works of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations.

On February 18, 1938, the despairing and disillusioned Lugones committed suicide by taking a mixture of whisky and cyanide while staying at the river resort of El Tigre in Buenos Aires. Political frustration has been the most widely cited cause of his suicide. Nevertheless, recent publications in Argentina have shed light on another possible motivation: Lugones was very enamored of a girl he met at one of his lectures in the university. He maintained a passionate and emotional relationship with her until, discovered and pressured by his son, he was forced to leave her, causing in him a depressive decline that would end his life.

His descendants have had similarly tragic fates. It is believed that his son Polo, the chief of police during Uriburu&#x27;s dictatorship, was the creator of the picana and the one who introduced it as a method of torture. Polo Lugones committed suicide in 1971. Polo&#x27;s younger daughter, Susana &quot;Pirí&quot; Lugones, was detained and disappeared in December 1977 as a victim of the Dirty War. His older daughter, Carmen, whom he called Babú, is still alive. One of Pirí&#x27;s sons, Alejandro, committed suicide, like his great-grandfather, in Tigre. This comprises Lugones&#x27; tragic familial fate, curiously similar to that of Horacio Quiroga&#x27;s, himself a friend and admirer of Leopoldo Lugones.

==In popular culture==

&quot;La guerra gaucha&quot; (&quot;The Gaucha War&quot;) is a 1942 Argentine historical drama and epic film directed by Lucas Demare and starring Enrique Muiño, Francisco Petrone, Ángel Magaña, and Amelia Bence. The film&#x27;s script, written by Homero Manzi and Ulyses Petit de Murat, is based on the short story collection by Leopoldo Lugones published in 1905. The film premiered in Buenos Aires on November 20, 1942, and is considered by critics of Argentine cinema as one of the most successful films in the history of the cinema.

<text>Edward Gibbon Wakefield (20 March 179616 May 1862) was an English criminal who became a politician in colonial Canada and New Zealand. He is considered a key figure in the establishment of the colonies of South Australia and New Zealand (where he later served as a member of parliament). He also had significant interests in British North America, being involved in the drafting of Lord Durham&#x27;s Report and being a member of the Parliament of the Province of Canada for a short time.

He was best known for his colonisation scheme, sometimes referred to as the Wakefield scheme or the Wakefield system, which aimed to populate the new colony of South Australia with a workable combination of labourers, tradespeople, artisans and capital. The scheme was to be financed by the sale of land to the capitalists who would thereby support the other classes of emigrants.

Despite being imprisoned for three years in 1827 for kidnapping a fifteen-year-old girl in Britain, he enjoyed a lengthy career in colonial governments and colonial policy.

==Early life and education==
Wakefield was born in London in 1796, the eldest son of Edward Wakefield (1774–1854), a distinguished surveyor and land agent, and Susanna Crush (1767–1816). His grandmother, Priscilla Wakefield (1751–1832), was a popular author for the young, and one of the introducers of savings banks.

He was the brother of: Catherine Gurney Wakefield (1793–1873) (who was the mother of Charles Torlesse (1825–1866)); Daniel Bell Wakefield (1798–1858); Arthur Wakefield (1799–1843); William Hayward Wakefield (1801–1848); John Howard Wakefield (1803–1862); Felix Wakefield (1807–1875); Priscilla Susannah Wakefield (1809–1887); Percy Wakefield (1810–1832); and an unnamed child born in 1813.

Wakefield was educated at Westminster School in London, and Edinburgh.

==Early career, marriage and family==
He served as a King&#x27;s Messenger, carrying diplomatic mail all about Europe during the later stages of the Napoleonic Wars, both before and after the decisive Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

In 1816, he eloped with a Miss Eliza Pattle and they were subsequently married in Edinburgh. It appears to have been a love match, but the fact that she was a wealthy heiress probably played a part, with Edward receiving a marriage settlement of £70,000 (almost US$7m in 2018 dollars), with the prospect of more when Eliza turned 21.

The married couple, accompanied by the bride&#x27;s mother and various servants, moved to Genoa, Italy, where Wakefield was again employed in a diplomatic capacity. Here his first child, Susan Priscilla Wakefield, known as Nina, was born in 1817. The household returned to London in 1820 and a second child, Edward Jerningham Wakefield, was born. Four days later Eliza died, and Edward resigned his post. The two children were brought up by their aunt, Wakefield&#x27;s older sister, Catherine.

Nina was suffering from tuberculosis, and Wakefield took his daughter to Lisbon in Portugal in the hope of recovery. He employed a young peasant girl, Leocadia de Oliveira, whom he later fostered, to help care for Nina, and after Nina&#x27;s death in 1835, sent Leocadia on to Wellington, New Zealand, where she met John Taine and had 13 children.

==Abduction scandal (1826)==

Although wealthy by contemporary standards, Wakefield was not satisfied. He wished to acquire an estate and enter Parliament, for which he lacked sufficient capital. Through deception he wed another wealthy heiress in 1826 when he abducted 15-year-old Ellen Turner, after luring her from school with a false message about her mother&#x27;s health. Wakefield was brought to trial for the case known as the Shrigley abduction in 1826 and, along with his brother William, sentenced to three years in Newgate prison; the marriage, which had not been consummated, was dissolved by a special act of parliament.

==Influence on British colonisation (1829–1843) ==
===Principles of &quot;systematic colonisation&quot;===
He turned his attention while in prison to colonial subjects, and considered the main causes of the slow progress of the Australian colonies in the enormous size of the landed estates, the reckless manner in which land was given away, the absence of all systematic effort at colonisation, and the consequent discouragement of immigration and dearth of labour. He proposed to remedy this state of things by the sale of land in small quantities at a sufficient price, and the employment of the proceeds as a fund for promoting immigration. These views were expressed in his &quot;Letter from Sydney&quot; (1829; published under a false name), published while he was still in prison, but often quoted as if written on the spot. He had published pamphlets in prison in 1828 under the title &quot;Sketch of a Proposal for Colonising Australia&quot;, which had created a lot of interest.

The National Colonization Society (also spelt National Colonisation Society) was created in 1830 in order to advocate for the type of &quot;systematic colonisation&quot; set out in &quot;Letter from Sydney&quot;, based on three principles: careful selection of emigrants; the concentration of settlers; and the sale of land at a fixed, uniform, &quot;sufficient price&quot;, to provide funding for new settlers. Wakefield was a founder member, and Robert Gouger was elected (or appointed) inaugural secretary of the society, although he was later to fall out with Wakefield when they disagreed on the price that should be charged for land. Members over time included Robert Rintoul (editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;), Charles Buller, John Stuart Mill, Sir William Molesworth, W. W. Whitmore, and Sir William Hutt. Jeremy Bentham supported the ideas of the society. Colonel Robert Torrens and Robert Wilmot-Horton were on the committee of the society. The society published &quot;The Outline of a Plan of a Colony&quot;, later expanded and elaborated upon by Wakefield.

In 1831, Lord Howick, Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office was won over by the idea of selling land at a fixed, uniform price, and based his &quot;Ripon Regulations&quot; on this principle, issued in February 1831, which abolished free land grants, replacing them with and land sales at public auction, set at a minimum price of five shillings per acre in the colony of New South Wales.

After his &quot;Letter from Sydney&quot; in 1829, Wakefield&#x27;s name became associated with other &quot;scientific theories&quot; of colonisation similar to his. People who accepted these ideas were usually on the side of the colonists, and were called &quot;systematic colonizers,&quot; or (more commonly) &quot;colonial reformers&quot; and &quot;radical imperialists,&quot; to highlight their Radical Whig political roots.

After his release Wakefield briefly turned his attention to social questions at home, and produced a tract on the &quot;Punishment of Death&quot; (1831), with a graphic picture of the condemned sermon in Newgate, and another on the rural districts, with an equally powerful exhibition of the degraded condition of the agricultural labourer. He soon, however, became entirely engrossed with colonial affairs.

=== South Australia ===

In 1831, having impressed John Stuart Mill, Robert Torrens and other leading economists with the value of his ideas, Wakefield became involved in various schemes to promote the colonisation of South Australia. He believed that many of the social problems in Britain were caused by overpopulation, and he saw emigration to the colonies as a useful safety valve. He set out to design a colonisation scheme with a workable combination of labourers, artisans and capital. The scheme was to be financed by the sale of land to the capitalists who would thereby support the other classes of emigrants.

It took several attempts before the Province of South Australia was established. Although initially, Wakefield was a driving force, as it came closer to fruition, he was allowed less and less influence, with ally-turned-rival Robert Gouger eventually controlling execution of the scheme.

===America===
However, he did not lose interest in colonisation as a tool for social engineering. In 1833 he published anonymously &quot;England and America&quot;, a work primarily intended to develop his own colonial theory, which is done in the appendix entitled &quot;The Art of Colonization.&quot; The body of the work contains many new ideas, some of them reaching apparently extreme conclusions. It contains the distinct proposal that the transport of letters should be wholly free, and the prediction that, under given circumstances, the Americans would raise &quot;cheaper corn than has ever yet been raised&quot;.

===New Zealand Association ===
Soon, a new project was under way, the New Zealand Association. In 1837 the Colonial Office gave the New Zealand Association a charter to promote settlement in New Zealand. However, they attached conditions that were unacceptable to the members of the Association. After considerable discussion, interest in the project waned. Wakefield was undoubtedly one of the most influential voices in the Association, but he discovered another interest, Canada.

=== Canada – 1838 ===

In 1837, there were rebellions in both Lower Canada and Upper Canada. The colonial governments in both provinces had been able to suppress the rebellions, but the underlying political discontent had not been resolved. In January 1838, the government of Lord Melbourne appointed Lord Durham as Governor General of all of British North America, to inquire into the causes of the rebellions and to make recommendations to settle the disputes. Durham was authorised to appoint his own advisors, and chose Wakefield as one of them. Durham knew Wakefield through Wakefield&#x27;s plans for colonisation of New Zealand. He was a member of the New Zealand Association, set up by Wakefield ten years earlier to encourage emigration to New Zealand.

Durham was only prepared to accept the task if Wakefield accompanied him as Commissioner of Crown Lands. However, they both knew that Wakefield would be completely unacceptable to the British government, so Durham planned to announce the appointment only after he had reached Canada. Wakefield and his son, Edward Jerningham Wakefield, sailed secretly for Canada in April 1838, but before they arrived word had leaked out, and the appointment was forbidden by London. Durham appointed one of his other advisors, Charles Buller, as Commissioner, but kept Wakefield as an unofficial representative, advisor and negotiator, giving him effectively the same powers he would have had if he been appointed, but without being paid.

Wakefield&#x27;s main task was analysis of the issue of public lands and the relationship of land to settlement. He prepared a detailed report on public lands, arguing that the better way to encourage settlement was to sell Crown lands at higher prices than had been the case up to then, which would attract immigrants with capital. This approach had been tried without much success in Upper Canada some years before. Wakefield&#x27;s report on public lands became Appendix B to the Durham Report. No attempt was made to implement his policy proposals.

Durham met extensively with local political leaders, but at one point, Wakefield met with one of the reformers from Lower Canada, Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine. He also travelled to Saratoga Springs, New York, in an unsuccessful attempt to meet with the main leader of the &quot;Patriote movement&quot;, Louis-Joseph Papineau, who had fled to the United States during the Rebellion. It is not clear if Wakefield was acting on his own initiative in these conversations, or on secret instructions from Durham. He later said he was acting on his own, but LaFontaine had the clear impression he was acting for Durham. During his conversation with LaFontaine, Wakefield had tried to persuade him to publicly approve Durham&#x27;s policy concerning the exiles to Bermuda, and the death penalty for &quot;Patriotes&quot; still in the United States. LaFontaine refused, seeing in it his &quot;suicide politique&quot;. Wakefield was not impressed by LaFontaine, writing that he and the other &quot;Patriote&quot; leaders were &quot;profoundly ignorant of their own position and thoroughly devoid of judgment...&quot;

Durham abruptly resigned his post as Governor General in the fall of 1838. He had attempted to deal with those who had been caught in arms by pardoning the rank and file, exiling eight of the leaders to Bermuda, and threatening &quot;Patriotes&quot; in exile in the United States with death if they returned to Lower Canada. In London, Lord Brougham, former Lord Chancellor, vigorously criticised these actions, arguing that Durham had no legal authority to exile the leaders without trial, nor to threaten the exiles with death. Melbourne&#x27;s government disallowed Durham&#x27;s ordinance, which Durham took as a lack of confidence. He and Wakefield left Lower Canada shortly before the second outbreak of the Rebellion in November 1838.

In Britain, Durham went into seclusion while he wrote his report on the causes of the rebellions and his recommendations for reforms to prevent further unrest in the two colonies: &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot;. Wakefield and Buller are not mentioned in the report, but it seems likely that the report was written cooperatively by the three men, although some historians have asserted the primary author was Wakefield, while others have said it was Buller. (Lord Brougham, still a critic of Durham, commented that &quot;Wakefield thought it, Buller wrote it, Durham signed it.&quot;) The report recommended that the two colonies be united under a single government, but with the key recommendation that the government be drawn from the groups which had a majority in the Assembly: the basic principle of responsible government. Durham&#x27;s report was one of the first documents to outline this principle in detail.

Durham provided the proofs of the report to Cabinet on 31 January 1839, four days before he presented it to the Colonial Office. In the interval, the &quot;Times&quot; began publishing extracts from the report. It is not clear how the &quot;Times&quot; obtained the report, but it is generally accepted that Wakefield likely had a hand in it, to prevent the government from trying to bury the recommendation for responsible government. The report was formally laid before Parliament on 11 February 1839. Eventually this report, and its conclusions, became a blueprint for development of British colonial policy.

===The New Zealand Company===
The defunct New Zealand Association reformed itself as the New Zealand Company in June 1838. By the end of the year they had purchased a ship, the &quot;Tory&quot;. Early in 1839 they discovered that although they now complied with the conditions the government had laid down for the old New Zealand Association, it was not prepared to honour its promises. Furthermore, it was actively considering making New Zealand a British Colony in which case land sales would become a government monopoly.

At a meeting in March 1839, Wakefield was invited to become the director of the New Zealand Company. His philosophy was the same as when he planned his elopements: &quot;Possess yourself of the Soil and you are Secure.&quot;

It was decided that the &quot;Tory&quot; would sail for New Zealand as soon as possible. His brother William was appointed the leader of the expedition with his son Jerningham as his nominal secretary. They had some difficulty finding a suitable captain for the &quot;Tory&quot;, but then found Edward Main Chaffers who had been sailing master on HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; during Fitzroy&#x27;s circumnavigation. Dr. Ernst Dieffenbach was appointed as scientific officer, and Charles Heaphy as a draughtsman. The &quot;Tory&quot; left London on 5 May and called at Plymouth to complete the fitting out. Fearing a last-minute attempt by the government to prevent her sailing, Wakefield hastened down to Plymouth and advised their immediate departure. The &quot;Tory&quot; finally quit English shores on 12 May 1839 and reached New Zealand 96 days later.

Wakefield did not sail with the colonists, and many years were to pass before he saw New Zealand. He may have recognised that he did not have the patience, the skills or the talents needed on a frontier. His talents lay in visualising dramatic plans and grandiose schemes, ignoring the details, and then persuading other people to get involved. He was a salesman, a propagandist and a politician, secretly inspiring and guiding many parliamentary committees on colonial subjects, especially on the abolition of penal transportation.

By the end of 1839, he had dispatched eight more ships to New Zealand, before he even knew of the success of the &quot;Tory&quot; expedition led by his brother William. He then recruited another brother, Arthur, to lead another expedition, this time to settle in the Nelson area at the top of the South Island. Charles Torlesse, the 16-year-old son of his elder sister Catherine, and Rev. Charles Martin Torlesse, rector of Stoke-by-Nayland in Suffolk, sailed with Arthur as a trainee surveyor. By now William&#x27;s daughter, Emily, and his ward, Leocadia, were already in New Zealand. Two more of his brothers also went to New Zealand later, along with numerous nieces and nephews.

=== Canada (1841–1843) ===

Although active with the New Zealand Company, Wakefield had also maintained his interest in Canadian affairs. He returned briefly in 1841, a year after the British government had brought the &quot;Union Act, 1840&quot; into force. The government had only implemented part of Durham&#x27;s recommendations. The act merged Lower Canada and Upper Canada into the new Province of Canada, but had not implemented responsible government. There was a bicameral parliament with an elected Legislative Assembly and an appointed Legislative Council, but the Governor General still retained considerable control over the government.

Wakefield was involved with the North American Colonial Association of Ireland. At his instigation, the Association had purchased a large estate just outside Montreal, the seigneury of Villechauve, where they wanted to establish another colonial settlement. The seigneury, also known as Beauharnois, had been owned by Edward Ellice, a wealthy merchant and former British Cabinet minister, who had substantial business interests in British North America. (Ellice&#x27;s son, also named Edward Ellice, had been Durham&#x27;s private secretary. While in Lower Canada, he and his wife, Katherine Ellice, had been taken prisoner by &quot;Patriotes&quot; at the seigneury during the Battle of Beauharnois in November 1838.) In addition to the proposed settlements, the seigneury was also valuable because it was close to the location for a proposed canal, to avoid a stretch of rapids on the River St. Lawrence. The initial arrangement for purchase had been made in 1839, and in 1841 Wakefield made a brief trip to Canada to gain support for the canal proposal. He met with the Governor General, Lord Sydenham, who was interested in the proposal but wary of Wakefield&#x27;s involvement. Sydenham died in a riding accident in September 1841 before any decision was made.

Wakefield returned to Canada in January 1842 to lobby the new governor, Sir Charles Bagot, and stayed for almost a year. Although there was strong opposition in the Assembly to the canal proposal, a major loan guarantee from the British government ensured that funds could be obtained. In June 1842 the Executive Council approved the Beauharnois route, and construction began. As part of his lobbying, Wakefield positioned himself as a champion of French-Canadian interests, sending a series of letters to the &quot;Colonial Gazette&quot; in London, calling for greater French-Canadian involvement in the government of the province. He cultivated two significant &quot;Patriote&quot; leaders who had been imprisoned during the Rebellion, Denis-Benjamin Viger and Jean-Joseph Girouard. He also appeared to have a source within Governor Bagot&#x27;s office: in one letter to the &quot;Colonial Gazette&quot;, he correctly predicted that Bagot would appoint LaFontaine to the Executive Council within a month, a significant political advance for French-Canadians, and a major shift in imperial policy. It reached the point that rumours circulated that Wakefield himself was behind Bagot&#x27;s policy, a claim denied by Bagot, who stated that he had only met Wakefield two or three times.

At the end of the parliamentary session in October 1842, John William Dunscomb, the member of the Legislative Assembly for the Beauharnois district, resigned his seat, since he had taken a new position in Montreal. Wakefield saw an opportunity and stood for election in Beauharnois. Campaigning as a supporter of LaFontaine, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly in November 1842. Having been elected, he then returned to Britain.

Wakefield returned to Canada in September 1843 for the parliamentary session. He initially aligned himself with the French-Canadian Group under LaFontaine&#x27;s leadership, but part-way through the session he left them. He had introduced a bill to make the North American Colonial Association of Ireland a mortgage and trust company, with an accompanying colonisation plan. When the French-Canadian Group refused to support his proposals, he left them and shifted his support to the new Governor General, Sir Charles Metcalfe. (Bagot had died earlier in the year.)

In November, there was a major political crisis: LaFontaine and his colleague, Robert Baldwin, who had taken office on the principle of responsible government, got into a dispute with Metcalfe over appointments that Metcalfe made without consulting the Executive Council. LaFontaine, Baldwin, and all but one of the members of the Executive Council resigned, arguing that Metcalfe&#x27;s actions were inconsistent with the principle of responsible government. There was a major debate in the Assembly over the issue, resulting in the passage of a motion condemning Governor Metcalfe for his actions. Wakefield defended Metcalfe, relying on a narrow interpretation of the principle of responsible government, and also insinuating that the real reason LaFontaine and Baldwin had resigned was that they feared defeat on a taxation bill they had introduced. He voted against the motion and in support of Metcalfe, along with Viger and some other members who left the French-Canadian Group on the issue. Following the resignations, Wakefield appeared to be heavily involved in giving advice to Metcalfe, with some saying that he was the real governor. His motivation appears to have been still focused on his schemes to develop the Beauharnois area for the Colonial Association.

Metcalfe prorogued the Assembly after the passage of the motion. He found it difficult to assemble a new ministry, and did not recall the Assembly, instead dissolving it for a general election in 1844. Wakefield had returned to Britain after the 1843 session, and did not stand for re-election. In 1844, he wrote two pieces defending Metcalfe: a pamphlet, &quot;A View of Sir Charles Metcalfe&#x27;s Government of Canada&quot;, and an article &quot;Sir Charles Metcalfe in Canada&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Colonial Magazine&quot; in July 1844. That was the end of his involvement with Canadian affairs, apart from being paid about £20,000 by the Association for his work in Canada.

==England and illness (1844–1852)==

Wakefield returned to England in early 1844 to find the New Zealand Company under serious attack from the Colonial Office. He threw himself into the campaign to save his project. In August 1844 he had a stroke, followed in later months by several other minor strokes, and he had to retire. There is also a possibility that his mental health was not too sound in the succeeding months. His son Jerningham returned from New Zealand about this time and cared for him. In August 1845 he went to France to recuperate and to give himself a break from New Zealand affairs. It did not serve his purpose and he returned to London two months later in a semi-invalid state. During his convalescence he wrote his book &quot;A View of the Art of Colonization&quot;, in the form of letters between a &quot;Statesman&quot; and a &quot;Colonist&quot;.

By January 1846 Wakefield was back to his scheming. By now Gladstone was Colonial Secretary. Wakefield approached him early in the New Year with a fairly radical plan that both the Government and the New Zealand Company should withdraw from New Zealand affairs and the colony should become self-governing. While it might have been a good idea, Wakefield wanted it accepted immediately, and became at first heated and then distressed when some months later, it was still being considered.

In August 1846, he had another, potentially fatal stroke. His friend, Charles Buller, took up the negotiations. In May 1847 the British Government agreed to take over the debts of the New Zealand Company and to buy out their interests in the Colony. The directors readily accepted the offer. Wakefield found he was powerless and unable to influence the decision, which did not please him.

Without notice, his youngest brother Felix Wakefield, who had been in Tasmania since the early 1830s, reappeared in England accompanied by eight of his children, having abandoned his wife and youngest child in Australia. Felix had no money and no prospects and was unable to provide for his family. Wakefield found him somewhere to live and farmed out the children among relatives, but it was another year before his health was strong enough to take over the role of surrogate father, Felix being apparently unable to do anything for his family.

Meanwhile, Wakefield was getting involved in a new scheme. He was working with John Robert Godley to promote a new settlement in New Zealand, this one to be sponsored by the Church of England. This plan matured to become the Canterbury Settlement. The first ship sailed from England in December 1849 with Godley in command of the expedition. Jerningham Wakefield also sailed with them, his health and finances ruined by his dissipated lifestyle in London. The first immigrant ships bound for Canterbury sailed from Plymouth in September 1850, and others followed.

In the same year, Wakefield co-founded the Colonial Reform Society with Charles Adderley, a landowner and member of parliament for North Staffordshire.

Felix was causing problems back in Britain and causing Wakefield a great deal of grief. Felix decided that settlement in New Zealand was the solution to all his problems. Wakefield reluctantly sponsored his passage to Canterbury, where Felix was allocated (40 hectares) of land near Sumner. He and six of his children arrived in Lyttelton in November 1851. A short time later one of the other settlers described him as &quot;the worst man we have in Canterbury&quot;.

During 1851 and 1852 Wakefield continued to work for the Canterbury Association and also worked towards making New Zealand a self-governing colony. The New Zealand Constitution Act was passed on 30 June 1852. There was general satisfaction among New Zealanders about this, although they were less happy to discover that the new government was to be saddled with the remaining debts of the defunct New Zealand Company.

==Move to New Zealand (1853)==
Wakefield now decided that he had achieved everything he could in England; it was time to see the colony he felt he had created. He sailed from Plymouth in September 1852, knowing he would never return. His sister Catherine and her son Charley came to see him off. Then, at the last minute, his father appeared. Edward Wakefield was now 78 years old; he and Wakefield had not spoken since the Ellen Turner abduction 26 years before. They were reconciled, and the elder Edward died two years later.
The ship arrived at Port Lyttelton on 2 February 1853. Wakefield had travelled with Henry Sewell who had been deputy chairman and full-time manager of the Canterbury Association. It seems likely that he expected to be welcomed as a founding father of the colony; to be feted and immediately asked to assume the leadership of colony. However, colonisation had inevitably changed the perspectives of the people of Canterbury. Many of them felt they had been let down and cheated by the Association, and the two arrivals were firmly linked in their minds with the broken promises and disappointments of the Association.

James Edward FitzGerald, who was one of the leaders of Canterbury, and who was elected as Superintendent of the Canterbury Province a few months later (in July 1853), declined to meet with Wakefield for some days and certainly was unwilling to relinquish control to someone he probably saw as a tainted politician from London.

Within a very short time Wakefield was completely disenchanted with Canterbury. He claimed the citizens were far too parochial in their outlook; they were far more concerned with domestic issues rather than national politics. Clearly they were not worthy of Edward Gibbon Wakefield and after only one month he left Canterbury and sailed for Wellington.

There was enough political ferment in Wellington to satisfy even Wakefield. Governor George Grey had just proclaimed self-government for New Zealand, but it was a watered down version, significantly less &quot;self-government&quot; than was described in the New Zealand Constitution Act of the year before. In his own way George Grey was every bit as unscrupulous as Wakefield, and he had very firm ideas on what was good for New Zealand. They were not necessarily bad ideas, but they were different from Wakefield&#x27;s. It seems likely that even before they met both men knew they would clash.

When they arrived in Wellington, Wakefield declined to go ashore until he knew he was going to be properly received by the Governor. Grey promptly left town. Sewell went ashore and met with various dignitaries including Daniel Bell Wakefield, another of the brothers who had been in Wellington for some years practising law and was Attorney General of the Province. He also managed to get an address of welcome for Wakefield, written by Isaac Featherston and signed by many of the citizens.

Wakefield went on the attack almost as soon as he landed. He took issue with George Grey on his policy on land sales. Grey was in favour of selling land very cheaply to encourage the flow of settlers. Wakefield wanted to keep the price of land high so that the growth of the colony could be financed by land sales; it was a fundamental tenet of his colonial theory. He and Sewell applied for an injunction to prevent the Commissioner of Crown Lands selling any further lands under Governor Grey&#x27;s regulations. The Crown Commissioner was Wakefield&#x27;s second cousin, Francis Dillon Bell, early New Zealand really was a Wakefield family business.

Within a month of arriving in Wellington, Wakefield began a campaign in London to have him recalled not knowing he had already applied to leave the colony. Meanwhile, Grey was in control. He responded to the attacks on him by questioning Wakefield&#x27;s integrity, always an easy target. Particularly he focussed on the generous fees that had been paid to Wakefield as a Director of the New Zealand Company at a time when it was reneging on its debts in New Zealand. This served to remind the people of Wellington just how badly they had been let down by the company and how angry they felt about it. Wakefield managed to clear himself of the actual charges, but a great deal of dirt was thrown around.

===Member of Parliament===


Elections for the Wellington Provincial Council and General Assembly, the national parliament, were held in August 1853. Wakefield stood for the Hutt electorate, and to the surprise of some, and the disappointment of others, he was elected to both the Provincial Council and the General Assembly.

The first sitting of the Provincial Assembly was in October 1853. Wakefield was not only the senior member but also clearly the most experienced politically. However, the Assembly was controlled by the Constitutional Party led by Dr. Isaac Featherston and they had been heavily involved in the recent criticism of his integrity. Working in opposition, Wakefield probably made certain that the Provincial Assembly became a working democracy rather than a Constitutional Party oligarchy. His wide knowledge of parliamentary law and custom made certain that the body of the assembly could not be ignored by the ruling party.

Early in 1854 the town of Wellington held a Founders&#x27; Festival. Three hundred people attended including sixty Māori and all the Wakefields. The principal toast of the evening was to: &quot;The original founders of the Colony and Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield&quot;. Whatever the vicissitudes of the last few months, it confirmed Wakefield as one of the leading political figures of colony, possibly the only one with stature to take on Governor Grey.

====Responsible government conflict====
Grey was gone and Colonel Robert Wynyard was acting as Governor. Wynyard opened the 1st New Zealand Parliament on 27 May 1854. Wakefield and James Fitzgerald each immediately began manoeuvering for positions of influence, with Wakefield moving a motion for Parliament to appoint its own responsible governments (Ministers of the Crown). Wakefield took a position supporting Wynyard, while FitzGerald took an opposite tack. The dispute over responsible government dragged on. As a compromise, on 7 June, Wynyard appointed James FitzGerald to the Executive Council. Wakefield was not asked to form a part of the ministry.

By July 1854 FitzGerald was in serious conflict with Wynyard; FitzGerald&#x27;s Executive Council (cabinet) resigned on 2 August 1854. Wakefield was summoned to form a government; he refused to do so. He said instead that he would advise Wynyard, so long as he acted on his advice alone. In effect, he sought to turn Wynyard into his own puppet. He did not have a majority of supporters in the house, and the assembly was paralysed. Wynyard prorogued parliament on 17 August, but he had to recall it again by the end of the month when he needed money to run the country. The new ministry, headed by Thomas Forsaith, composed mainly of Wakefield&#x27;s supporters and it was soon clear that he was the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the ministry. However, they failed to survive an early vote of no confidence, and New Zealand&#x27;s second government collapsed on 2 September 1854. In the remaining two weeks of the Assembly&#x27;s life they managed to pass some useful legislation before they were dismissed and new elections called.
Wakefield held two election meetings for his constituents in the Hutt Valley, which were well received. A third meeting was scheduled but never happened. On the night of 5 December 1855, Wakefield fell ill with rheumatic fever and neuralgia. He retired to his house in Wellington. He retired from the Hutt seat on 15 September 1855 and retired from all political activity, making no more public appearances. He lived for another seven years, but his political life was over.

==Death and legacy==

In 1839 John Hill named the Wakefield River, a river north of Adelaide in the new colony of South Australia, after Wakefield, which later led to the naming of Port Wakefield. A sculpture of Wakefield was unveiled at the Auckland High Court in 1866, as a part of a series of relief sculptures created by Anton Teutenberg.

Wakefield is mentioned and criticised in Chapter 33 of Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital &quot;(Volume 1) and also in Henry George&#x27;s .

By the turn of the twenty-first century, the direct descendants of the Wakefield family left in New Zealand were William Wakefield Lawrence Clague resident in Kāpiti, and descendants of Edward&#x27;s sister Catherine Gurney Wakefield, who married Charles Torlesse. A great-great-nephew of William and Edward Gibbon Wakefield, William Clague, is the great-great-grandson of John Howard Wakefield, one of the original brothers. John Howard Wakefield spent most of his life in India, ending his days back in England unlike his two better-known siblings.

In 2020, some Wellington councillors called for Wakefield monuments to be removed.

<doc id="317367" wikidata="Q1691406" url="?curid=317367" title="River Soar">
<text>The River Soar () is a major tributary of the River Trent in the East Midlands as well as the principal river of Leicestershire, England. The source of the river is midway between Hinckley and Lutterworth. The river then flows north through Leicester, where it is joined by the Grand Union Canal. Continuing on through the Leicestershire Soar Valley, it passes Loughborough and Kegworth until it reaches the Trent at the county boundary. In the 18th century, the Soar was made navigable, initially between Loughborough and the Trent, and then through to Leicester. It was not until the early 19th century that it was linked by the Grand Union Canal to the wider network to the south and to London.

==Name==
The name of the &quot;Soar&quot; is included in a family of old river-names derived from a root &quot;*ser-&quot; &quot;to flow&quot;, alongside (among others)
&quot;Saravus&quot; (&quot;Soar&quot;, a tributary of the Moselle in Belgium), &quot;Sera&quot; (&quot;la Serre&quot;, &quot;la Cère&quot; and &quot;le Séran&quot;, three rivers in France), &quot;Serantia&quot; (&quot;Sierentz&quot;, Alsace), &quot;Serma&quot; (&quot;Schremm&quot;, Brandenburg), &quot;Sora&quot; (&quot;Cwm Sorgwm&quot;, Wales), &quot;Sorna&quot; (&quot;die Zorn&quot;, Alsace), &quot;Sara&quot; (&quot;Saire&quot;), &quot;Saar(e)&quot; (Brandenburg), &quot;Saros&quot; (&quot;Sar&quot;, Spain), &quot;Sarius&quot; (&quot;Serio&quot;, Lombardy), &quot;Sarià&quot; (Lithuania), &quot;Saravus&quot; (&quot;Saar&quot;, Germany), &quot;Sarnivos&quot; (&quot;Sernf&quot;, Glarus), etc.

According to a suggestion due to William Somner (1701) the Soar river may formerly have been called the &quot;Leir&quot;, from Brittonic *&quot;Ligera&quot; or *&quot;Ligora&quot;, cognate with the French &quot;Loire&quot;. This theory is based on the name of Leicester (as well as Loughborough and the village of Leire) being derived from the name of the river.

==Course==
The Soar rises near Wibtoft in Warwickshire, and flows north to join the Soar Brook near Sharnford, it then continues in a north-easterly direction, passing through Croft and between Narborough and Littlethorpe, until on the outskirts of Leicester it is joined by the Sence near Enderby. Before flowing through the centre of the city it meets the Grand Union Canal at Aylestone, where it is also joined by the River Biam. After passing over Freemens Weir, the river splits and recombines with the canal, creating an area of Leicester called Bede Island. The navigable arm that runs to the east has been canalised with parallel banks and is known as &#x27;The Mile Straight&#x27;. Beyond Blackfriars, the river splits again to form Frog Island and Abbey Park; it recombines at Belgrave where it passes beside the National Space Centre.

Once out of the city the Soar passes Birstall and threads its way through the lakes of Watermead Country Park, until it reaches Wanlip. The river then meets the once navigable River Wreake, near Cossington Mill, with another tributary the Rothley Brook, joining the river just downstream. The Soar continues north-east to reach Mountsorrel then passes between Quorn and Barrow-on-Soar, at which point an arm of the canal extends into Loughborough, although the river passes to the East of the town at Cotes. Downstream of Stanford on Soar the river forms the county boundary between Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire. Between Stanford and Normanton on Soar, the canal rejoins the river, which then continues to Zouch, passing the &#x27;Devils Elbow&#x27; to reach Kegworth. Downstream of Kegworth, it meets the Kingston Brook, near the village of the same name, passing Ratcliffe-on-Soar and its power station, before flowing into the Trent at Trent Lock.

==Pollution==

The River Soar is rich in wildlife with thriving bird, fish and plant populations being popular with wildlife enthusiasts. The river was once notorious for its unusual pink colour - a result of discharges from Leicester&#x27;s prosperous textile industries. However the end to textile industries near the river in Leicester and clean-up work by the Environment Agency has now restored it to its natural state.

Industry now wanting to attempt to discharge any sewage waste into the river must now obtain an agreement from the Environment Agency. Several consents have been granted to companies to use the River Soar, however the quantity and quality of the sewage is strictly controlled to a preset amount that is agreed on with the Environment Agency.

The quality of any water is determined by what is able to contaminate the river upstream, the River Soar is constantly monitored by the Environment Agency which keeps check on the level of pollution. The pollution in the water running through the Soar in the city of Leicester is low and the water is generally of good quality; however there is a significant decrease in the quality just downstream of the city, where the Wanlip sewage treatment works enters the river.

New tourism industry has caused environmental problems; Barge hulls and propellers may cause &quot;physical damage and uprooting&quot; of plants and turbulence may increase water turbidity to the extent that light may not reach underwater plants, reducing photosynthesis. Sewage works have an adverse effect on water life.

==History==

* 1634 Thomas Skipwith of Cotes obtained a grant from Charles I to make the river Soar &quot;portable for barges and boats&quot;, though the scheme was never completed.
* 1794 The Leicester Canal was opened, making the Soar navigable for almost . The western line was also opened – this was known as the Charnwood Forest Branch. However, most of the branch was made up of rail tracks rather than a waterway. This included a uphill climb from Loughborough Basin. At the western end of the branch, rail lines travelled towards Coleorton and Swannington. A track to Cloudhill, which would have connected to similar lines on the Ashby Canal, was proposed but never built.
* 1795 Another branch line (operated by a separate company) opened from the main line of the Leicester Canal (between Cossington and Syston) to Melton Mowbray. The line was long and used the River Wreake for virtually the whole of its course. The line was sometimes known as the Wreake Navigation, though it is better known as the Melton Mowbray Navigation. This new line was so successful that within a year William Jessop was appointed to survey another new line which would extend the Melton Mowbray Navigation to Oakham in Rutland, a further . The extension would be called the Oakham Canal. An act of Parliament, the Oakham Canal Act 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 103), was passed and work began.
* 1796 While the lines to Leicester and Melton Mowbray were doing very well, trade on the Charnwood Forest Branch was very slow to pick up. The company even put on demonstrations in an attempt to encourage its use. With no real success being gained from this the company went into the coal carrying and selling business itself.
* 1797 A proposal to extend the main line of the Leicester Canal much further south was announced. A new canal, the Leicestershire &amp; Northamptonshire Union Canal, would link the river Soar with the River Nene. However, like many great ideas, the money ran out before the imagination did and the line reached just 17 of the proposed , coming to a stop at Debdale Wharf near Kibworth Beauchamp. Thus the Leicestershire &amp; Northamptonshire Canal never even got close to Northamptonshire. In fact, the whole project had proved to be something of a failure, the company having spent thousands of pounds building a waterway which passed nowhere in particular and ended in the middle of the countryside miles from any major town. Meanwhile, the Charnwood Forest Branch was still struggling to attract any trade. Water supply was one reason for lack of use, so the company built Blackbrook Reservoir. Following this, trade picked up but only very slightly.
* 1802 The Oakham Canal opened after costing almost £70,000 to build. It was long, with 19 broad locks. Boats could now travel onto the River Soar from Rutland.
* 1809 The main line of the Leicestershire &amp; Northamptonshire Canal was extended from its resting place near Kibworth Beauchamp to Market Harborough where once again the work came to a stop. All the same, it was now a considerable navigation, linking the south of Leicestershire to the river Trent. However, there was still no link to the Grand Junction Canal.
* 1810 By now ideas of connecting Leicester to Northampton seemed pointless. The Grand Junction Canal was running a tramway into Northampton and would surely soon convert this to a full navigation. The obvious thing to do now was to connect the Leicester navigations to the Grand Junction Canal.
* 1814 The new link between the Leicester navigations and the Grand Junction Canal opened and was named the Grand Union Canal (not to be confused with the later canal route of the same name).
* 1832 The Leicester and Swannington Railway opened from the Leicestershire coalfield to a wharf alongside the canal at West Bridge, Leicester. This allowed Leicestershire coal to be cheaply carried on southwards for sale in London.
* 1848 The owners of the River Soar Navigation were finally able to officially abandon the Charnwood Forest Branch which had stood idle since 1801.
* 1877 After 80 years, the Melton Mowbray (or Wreake) Navigation also closed, leaving Melton Mowbray with no waterway outlet to the main canal system.
* 1886 Mr. Fellows of Fellows Morton &amp; Clayton (who were the main carriers on the Grand Union link) pushed the company to convert the canal to wide beam. When this was not done he tried to encourage the Grand Junction Company to buy the link.
* 1894 – The Grand Union and the Leicestershire &amp; Northamptonshire Union canals were purchased by the Grand Junction Canal Company. By now, though, even the Grand Junction Company wasn&#x27;t whole-heartedly in favour of widening the link. Instead they looked into methods of making the lock flights more efficient. The simple answer was to make a duplicate flight alongside the existing locks to make two-way traffic but this would cause other problems, especially water supply, which was already a major headache.
* 1931 – The whole stretch of waterway from Norton Junction through to Leicester and on to Long Eaton was merged with the Grand Junction Canal to form the Grand Union Canal.

===Industry===
The River Soar before the late 1700 was too small and shallow to allow navigation of barges; however this was partially solved by the construction of the Leicester canal which allowed the Soar to be navigable for almost about .

The expansion of the canal meant that industry could start to develop along the canal side, with the transport provided by the canal being &quot;vital to the industry.&quot; This included buildings and industries like &quot;wind and watermills; brewing and malting; bridges; canal and railway structures; public utilities.&quot;

&quot;By 1895, there were 231 listed hosiery manufacturers in the county. In
Leicester, the industry employed 10% of the population in 1851, and around 7% in 1881 and 1911.&quot; This shows the importance of hosiery to Leicester&#x27;s economy. This industry needed a consistent supply of water and needed transport links, so was located alongside the canal. Due to the transport links provided by the Grand Union Canal, the Hosiery industry was able to expand rapidly.

Many of these factories however soon outgrew themselves, moving to new larger sites, which vacated space for other trades such as boot and shoe manufacture, printing or box making.

Railway competition in the nineteenth century reduced canal profits. This was the beginning of the end for many of the companies who owned the canals; several of these companies converted their canals to railways while many of the others were bought out by railway companies looking to expand their businesses.

With the decline of industry in the 1960s, the warehouses and factories which were once the core of Leicester&#x27;s economy had fallen into dereliction. Leicester City Council has made a move towards re-developing the waterfront &quot;offering one of the most exciting waterside regeneration opportunities in the country.&quot; The company is currently building luxury waterside apartments. This will enhance the areas aesthetic values. Research conducted by Newcastle University suggests that people&#x27;s desire to reside on the waterfront and enjoy recreation offered by the canal is upset by &quot;visually unattractive features, such as run-down derelict areas and poor design&quot;.

The re-development plan has included the building of the Walkers stadium, home to Leicester City F.C., along the canal in 2002, &quot;from a barren, desolate piece of waste-ground has risen a stunning futuristic collaboration of steel and glass that dominates the skyline of Leicester.&quot; Old warehouses have also been converted into student accommodation for De Montfort University, increasing the value of the area.

On the eastern bank of the Soar in central Leicester are the premises of Donisthorpe and Company, a producer of textiles. The Donisthorpe Mill, also known as Friars&#x27; Mill, is one of the oldest mills in the East Midlands, and manufacturing activity has occurred on its site since the 1730s. The mill was awarded listed status in 1975. A number of surrounding buildings, including a Victorian pump house, were also listed at this time. The Donisthorpe Company left the factory in 1983, which led to immediate concerns about the mill&#x27;s conservation. The building stood empty for a number of years, and fell into a state of disrepair. In July 2012, a fire destroyed its roof, clocktower and most of the interior. In November 2012, Leicester City Council announced its decision to purchase and restore the Donisthorpe Mill building.

==Legend==
Geoffrey of Monmouth, who claimed Leicester was named for an eponymous King Leir, claimed that the king was buried in an underground chamber beneath the river near Leicester. This was supposedly devoted to the god Janus.

Leir, Lerion, and Ligora(ceastre) all derive from the old Brittonic name of the River Soar, *Ligera or *Ligora.

The body of King Richard III was sometimes said to have been thrown into the river during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. From this legend, the bridge carrying the A47 across the Soar at Leicester is known as &quot;King Richard&#x27;s Bridge&quot;. However, in 2013, it was confirmed that the skeleton discovered beneath a car park in 2012 was, in fact, that of Richard III and, in March 2015, the skeleton was re-interred in Leicester Cathedral.

==Tourism==

The Soar is now a hive of tourism rather than of industry. Holiday narrowboat cruises are extremely popular as it is a relaxing way to visit the country and get &#x27;in-touch&#x27; with nature. The tow-paths next to the canal are used for &quot;cycling, rambling, horse-riding and picnicking&quot; (Leicester City Council, 2005).

The waterway is a popular location for match and occasional fishing. There are large carp, chub, bream, roach, and perch in the canal, plus dace and barbel on some stretches.

==Sport==
The stretch of the River Soar which passes through the centre of Leicester known as the &#x27;Mile Straight&#x27; is home to De Montfort University Rowing Club, the University of Leicester Boat Club and Leicester Rowing Club a rowing and sculling club formed in 1882.

<text>The bush stone-curlew or bush thick-knee (Burhinus grallarius, obsolete name &quot;Burhinus magnirostris&quot;) is a large, ground-dwelling bird endemic to Australia. Its favoured habitat is open plains and woodlands, where it stalks slowly at night in search of invertebrates such as insects. Its grey-brown coloration is distinguished by dark streaks, its eyes are large and legs are long. It is capable of flight, but relies on the camouflage of its plumage to evade detection during the day; the bush curlew adopts a rigid posture when it becomes aware of an observer. Both sexes care for two eggs laid on the bare ground, usually sited near bush in a shaded position or next to a fallen branch.

==Taxonomy==
The bush stone-curlew was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name &quot;Charadius grallarius&quot;.
Latham published three names simultaneously; however, the seniority of &quot;C. grallarius&quot; follows the publication of the names in John Gould&#x27;s &quot;Birds of Australia&quot; in 1845.

Until a revision determining the priority of names assigned to this species, ornithologists cited the description under the epithet &quot;B. magnirostris&quot;. Descriptions of subspecies were published by Gregory Mathews in 1912, &quot;B. m. rufescens&quot; and &quot;B. m. broomei&quot; describing specimens collected in western Australia and &quot;B. m. ramsayi&quot; collected in the east at Queensland. These descriptions are recognised as synonymous with &quot;B. grallarius&quot;.

A species of the widely distributed family Burhinidae, also represented in Australia by the beach stone-curlew &quot;Esacus magnirostris&quot;, it is terrestrial forager of semiarid inland environments related to the shorebirds and waders of the order Charadriiformes.

Bush stone-curlew is the common name almost exclusively used for this species within Australia, its natural range. A name used by the indigenous peoples of Western Australia, &quot;wee-lo&quot;, was reported by John Gilbert and published by Gould in 1845. Later authorities included this name as current at the Northwest Cape and Southwest Australia, the similar &quot;wee-loo&quot; at Pallinup River, and &quot;welojabbin&quot;, also in the southwest, and &quot;windoo&quot; at a district in the western interior.
Up to the early 20th century, the name southern stone-plover was used in settler texts. International sources may use the name bush thick-knee, using one of the common names for the genus &quot;Burhinus&quot;. Other common names that have been cited as used for this species are southern stone-curlew and scrub stone-curlew. 
==Description==
A species of &quot;Burhinus&quot;, a genus of large-eyed and long-legged terrestrial foragers known as thick-knees, it is slender in form and a grey and brown colour with distinctive markings. The bird has conspicuous dark streaks over the buff and greyish white feathers of the upperparts and spotted markings on the wings. The plumage at lower side of the bird is also strongly streaked with dark brown over white and buff feathers.
The total length of the species, including a bill around 45 mm and tail 180 mm, is 550 mm; the wingspan approaches 1 m across.
Black flight feathers on the wing reveal a light buff patch when extended, and the plumage has a light area at the shoulder.
The head is distinguished by a band of dark feathers over the eye and down the neck, and a buff colour at the forehead and brow over the eye. The iris is bright yellow; bare skin near the eye is black. The long legs of the species are an olive-green colour, and the bill is darkish in tone.

The sexes are similar, with juveniles displaying a paler plumage that otherwise resembles the adults.

This stone-curlew&#x27;s voice is loud and can be heard at a great distance. The call of &quot;weeloo&quot; has an eerie and plaintive tone and is a familiar sound of the night in the Australian bush.
The frequency of calls increases when weather conditions are changing, especially when rain is approaching an area.
Several individuals may join their voices in chorus, greatly intensifying the extraordinary quality of their nocturnal calling.
The coloration of the eggshell is generally a stone grey with brownish blotching, although this is variable and often matches the environment to provide camouflage. Size of the egg is also variable, on average it is 53 × 39 mm, yet differences in nearby nests or between the two eggs of the same brood are recorded.

No other Australian bird resembles the bush curlew. Another species of the family, the beach stone-curlew also known as a wee-lo, is distinguished by its plumage and larger bill and is only found at the coast. Confusion with the nightjars is possible, but the species of &quot;Caprimulgus&quot; are smaller and fly in a different manner.

==Behaviour==
Like most stone-curlews, it is mainly nocturnal and specialises in hunting small grassland animals; frogs, spiders, insects, molluscs, crustaceans, snakes, lizards, and small mammals are all taken, mostly gleaned or probed from soft soil or rotting wood; a few seeds or tubers are also consumed, particularly in drought years. Birds usually forage individually or in pairs over a large home range, particularly on moonlit nights.

During the day, bush stone-curlews tend to remain inactive, sheltering amongst tall grass or the shade of shrubs and trees, relying on their cryptic plumage to protect them from predators. When disturbed, they freeze motionless, often in odd-looking postures. For visual predators such as raptors and humans, this works well, but it serves little purpose with animals that hunt by scent such as foxes, dingoes, or goannas.
Approaching the camouflaged individual does not dissuade it from this behaviour, maintaining the rigid posture even if handled.
If moving from a disturbance, they crouch and walk stealthily into vegetation, only attempting to fly if vigorously pursued.
Despite their ungainly appearance and habit of freezing motionless, they are sure-footed, fast, and agile on the ground, and although they seldom fly during daylight hours, they are far from clumsy in the air; flight is rapid and direct on long, broad wings.

The bush stone-curlew is probably heard more than it is seen. Its call sounds like a wail or a scream in the night. When scared, it screeches – a sound similar to the screech of a possum.
A field report from Brookton, Western Australia, noted that their call was heard in response to the cry of possums shot by hunters. When threatened (presumably in the presence of a nest), they may raise their wings wide and high in an impressive threat posture and emit a loud, hoarse hissing noise.
The bush curlew is sometimes recorded in flocks, but when the breeding season occurs, the number of birds in a locality is the usually just a mating pair. Like other ground-nesting birds, the females only select a site to lay the eggs and provide no other adornment to the nest; care of the site is performed by both parents. The brooding parent discreetly moves from the site if disturbed in the first few days of incubation but remains to defend an egg at a later stage of development. The parent adopts its frozen posture and lays over the eggs in an attempt to hide them.
An egg that has been discovered by an intruder may be moved a short distance away.
==Distribution and habitat==
The bush stone-curlew has a broad habitat preference, but is rarely seen in rainforest, arid desert, or urban or agricultural regions. The species is found in open forest, eucalyptus woodland, rainforest edges, grassy plains, arid scrubland, and along inland watercourses. They are not a migratory species, although weather conditions may cause them to relocate to another site in a local area. It is a common species around the cities of Brisbane, Cairns, and Townsville of Australia&#x27;s northeast, but is not found around urban areas in the south of its range. It can be found throughout Australia apart from the West Australian coast and Tasmania. It is still abundant in the tropical and subtropical north, but has become very rare in the less fertile south where it was once common.

Historical records of the species&#x27; occurrence in southwest Australia indicate it was common, sometimes abundant, but the population greatly declined in this region during the 20th century. The cause of its extirpation is largely attributed to the introduction of the red fox &quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;. The threat from predation by cats is noted as sometimes absent where the fox had already established itself. Attempts to control another exotic pest, the European rabbit, were also a threatening factor to this species succumbing to control methods of water poisoning and inadvertent capture in rabbit traps.
Bush curlew&#x27;s distribution range included most of the mainland of the Australian continent, although this has become reduced by around 90%, and is also found on offshore and nearby islands. A very small population is recorded breeding at a site in southern New Guinea.
The curlew was reported to sometimes find protection from foxes by residing near rural properties, receiving the consideration of farmers and defended by their dogs. Young birds have been known to become partially domesticated at rural properties.

Agricultural activity sometimes favoured the local populations; Frederick Whitlock noted in 1903 that the bush stone-curlew gained access to open water and favoured the partial clearing of forest where remnant shrubland remained. However, the dramatic decline in former strongholds that were converted to European farming practices was recorded in the mid-20th century.

==Conservation status==

Bush stone-curlews remain reasonably common in the north of Australia, but have become rare in the less fertile south. Many experts believe that fox predation is a prime factor in their decline, although some areas remain where foxes are common, yet the bush stone-curlew population remains healthy, so the true causes remain uncertain. Large-scale habitat destruction and fragmentation has undoubtedly been important, and may well be the major factor, although some evidence suggests that the species favours agricultural land and some urban areas with patches of remnant native vegetation over intact areas of vegetation.

Starting in 2014, bush stone-curlews have been reintroduced to a protected area in Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary in Canberra using a combination of hard- and soft-release strategies.

The assessment noted in the IUCN Red List is not threatened, revising an earlier listing of near threatened with extinction. The population is declining and estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 individuals in 2016. Historical declines recorded during colonisation of Australia are thought to have abated in the 32 years (three generations) prior to the IUCN&#x27;s 2016 assessment.

The bush stone-curlew is not listed as threatened on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is common in Queensland, and not considered to be regionally threatened there. In New South Wales, it is considered endangered under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. It is listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; in South Australia on the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972, and listed as &quot;threatened&quot; on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. Under this act, an action statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as endangered.

<text>The Silvretta Alps are a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps shared by Tirol, Vorarlberg (both in Austria) and Graubünden (Switzerland). The Austrian states of Tirol and Vorarlberg are connected by a pass road (Silvretta Hochalpenstraße at 2032 m). The majority of the peaks are elevated above three thousand metres and are surrounded by glaciers. Thus, the area is also known as the &quot;Blue Silvretta&quot;.

==Borders==

According to the Alpine Clubs, the Silvretta Alps are outlined from other groups by the following borders:
St. Gallenkirch - Ill river as far as Partenen - Zeinisjoch - Zeinisbach - Paznauntal as far as Ischgl - Fimbertal - Fimber Pass - Val Chöglias - Val Sinestra - Inn River from the mouth of the Branclabach to the mouth of the Susasca - Val Susasca - Flüela Pass - Davos - Wolfgang - Laretbach - Klosters - Schlappinbach - Schlappiner Joch - Valzifensbach - Gargellental - St. Gallenkirch.

The Silvretta Alps are surrounded by the Rätikon, Verwall, Samnaun, Sesvenna, Albula and Plessur ranges.

The Piz Buin is not the highest, but the most popular peak of the range. It can relatively easily be ascended from north or south through glaciers and stretches of easy climbing.

The Silvretta is famous for its skiing especially its many backcountry skiing possibilities. In the 1920s Ernest Hemingway was staying in the region for a winter (he lived at Schruns in Montafon, Austria). Later, he wrote a couple of short stories about his skiing experiences in the Silvretta. Some of these short stories are to be found in &quot;A moveable feast&quot;.

<text>The Rätikon is a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps, located at the border between Vorarlberg, Liechtenstein and Graubünden. It is the geological border between the Eastern and Western Alps and stretches from the Montafon as far as the Rhine. In the south, the Prättigau is its limit, and in the north, it is the Walgau. In the east, it borders the Silvretta groups.
The Rätikon mountain range derives its name from Raetia, a province of the Roman Empire, named after the Rhaetian (&quot;Raeti&quot; or &quot;Rhaeti&quot;) people.

== Topography and geology ==
The classification of the Rätikon to the central Eastern Alps is based solely on geographic-geological traditions. Large parts of the Rätikon consist of sedimentary rocks (limestone). From a geological point of view, the north-west Rätikon is assigned to the Northern Limestone Alps, while the South-West Rätikon belongs to the Bündner Schist/Bündner slate of the Western Alps.

== Peaks ==
Its chief peaks are:
*Schesaplana 2964 m (9725 ft)
*Schiltfluh 2890 m (9482 ft)
*Panüelerkopf 2859 m (9380 ft)
*Drusenfluh 2829 m (9282 ft)
*Madrisahorn 2830 m (9285 ft)
*Sulzfluh 2820 m (9252 ft)
*Wildberg 2788 m (9147 ft)
*Rätschenhorn 2703 m (8868 ft)
*Zimbaspitze 2643 m (8678 ft)
*Schijenflue 2627 m (8619 ft)
*Vorder Grauspitz 2599 m (8528 ft)
*Falknis 2566 m (8419 ft)
*Naafkopf 2571 m (8445 ft)
*Hornspitze 2537 m (8323 ft)
*Glegghorn 2447 m (8028 ft)
*Vilan 2376 m (7795 ft)
*Sassauna 2308 m (7572 ft)

For a list of passes see Passes of the Silvretta and Rätikon Ranges.

A multiday hike that follows a big portion of the Rätikon chain on its southern side is called &quot;Prättigauer Höhenweg&quot;.

== Neighboring mountain groups ==
The Rätikon is adjacent to the following other mountain groups in the Alps:
* In the north-east to the Bregenz Forest Mountains and to the Lechquellen Mountains, these two groups belong to the Northern Limestone Alps in the Eastern Alps.
* In the east to the Verwall Alps (Central Alps)
* In the southeast to the Silvretta Alps (Central Alps)
* In the south-west to the Plessur Alps (Central Alps)
* In the west to the Glarus Alps (Western Alps)
* In the north-west of the Appenzell Alps (Western Alps)
== Tourism ==
Because of the many mountains, the Rätikon is a first class area for all alpine sports such as hiking, skiing (including freeriding), cross-country skiing, mountain biking, etc. The position of the mountain chain allows for beautiful and panoramic views. The cableways permit shortened ascents and descents and enable pure high-altitude hiking.

Thanks to many Alpine shelters (&quot;huts&quot;), daylong or multi-day walks are possible. Many huts are hosted and offer sleeping accommodations. The season usually starts in early April to late September / October, depending on the weather. Before starting a tour, it is advisable to inquire about vacancies and locations at regional tourist offices or in the different villages.

<text>Thomas Hobson (c. 15441 January 1631) was an English carrier, best known as the origin of the expression Hobson&#x27;s choice.

==Eponym==

The term &quot;Hobson&#x27;s choice&quot; originated in the mid-seventeenth century, after Hobson&#x27;s death. The poet John Milton made Hobson, and the phrase, well known, by satirising him several times in mock epitaphs.
==Career==

Joseph Addison and his co-editor Richard Steele commented on Hobson in &quot;The Spectator&quot;:

Hobson arranged the delivery of mail between London and Cambridge up and down the Old North Road, operating a lucrative livery stable outside the gates of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge as an innkeeper. When his horses were not needed to deliver mail, he rented them to students and academic staff of the University of Cambridge.

The George Inn in Cambridge where Hobson&#x27;s stable was situated was located on the current grounds of St Catharine&#x27;s College and the stables were on the site of the current college chapel.

Hobson soon discovered that his fastest horses were the most popular, and thus overworked. So as not to exhaust them, he established a strict rotation system, allowing customers to rent only the next horse in line.

This policy, &quot;this one or none&quot; (&quot;take it or leave it&quot;), has come to be known as &quot;Hobson&#x27;s choice&quot;. It is &quot;not&quot; an absence of choice, rather choosing one thing or nothing.

In legal jargon, Hobson&#x27;s Choice is known to barristers as the &quot;cab-rank rule&quot;; the gentleman&#x27;s agreement that a barrister take a client who is first in line, whether the barrister likes it or not. This may come from Hobson&#x27;s choice of renting out hackney horses strictly by rote (long before the creation of the London Hackney Carriages Act 1843).

==Public works==

Hobson is best remembered in the English vernacular as something of a miser, but he was actually a very public-spirited man. He funded the construction of Hobson&#x27;s Conduit (or &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Brook&quot;), a man-made watercourse built in 1614 to provide clean drinking water to the population of Cambridge. The conduit channelled water from Vicar&#x27;s Brook, a lesser tributary of the River Cam fed by springs at Nine Wells five miles south of Cambridge.

Hobson is commemorated at Nine Wells on a nineteenth-century obelisk and in Cambridge on a seventeenth-century stone fountain at the conduit head. The fountain was moved there in 1856 from its original location in the Market Square after a fire in 1849, when it was replaced by a cast iron drinking fountain. Upstream the conduit is flanked by gardens adjoining Brookside and by the Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Downstream from the conduit head, the watercourse divides into four separate branches, mostly in underground culverts; the original drainage runnels on Trumpington Street, the oldest branch, are still visible on either side of the road.

==Later life and legacy==
Hobson bought Anglesey Priory in 1625 and converted it into a country house, which, under the name Anglesey Abbey, now belongs to the National Trust.

Hobson had acquired lands around Chesterton, Cambridgeshire by the late 1590s, but by 1608 had assigned them to his son Thomas. Thomas junior predeceased his father (d.1627), and the lands were subsequently bequeathed to the latter’s son Charles. Hobson lived at Chesterton Hall in 1627, four years before his death in 1631. Hobson was buried at St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church, Cambridge, near the chancel —although without inscription or monument. All 8 of Hobson&#x27;s children were baptized in the church, and in 1626 he donated a 1617 edition of the King James Bible to the church (now held by Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, of which Hobson was a benefactor). 

Hobson Street, in Cambridge city centre, is named after Thomas Hobson, and Hobson&#x27;s Passage takes its name from Hobson Street.

<doc id="317380" wikidata="Q407418" url="?curid=317380" title="Menthol">
<text>Menthol is an organic compound, specifically a monoterpenoid, that occurs naturally in the oils of several plants in the mint family, such as corn mint and peppermint. It is a white or clear waxy crystalline substance that is solid at room temperature and melts slightly above. The main form of menthol occurring in nature is (−)-menthol, which is assigned the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;,5&quot;R&quot;) configuration. 

For many people, menthol produces a cooling sensation when inhaled, eaten, or applied to the skin, and mint plants have been used for centuries for topical pain relief and as a food flavoring. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritation.

Menthol has been demonstrated to cause a subjective nasal decongestant effect without any objective decongestant action, and administration of menthol via a nasal inhaler in humans has also been shown to cause nasal congestion.

Menthol also acts as a weak κ-opioid receptor agonist. 

==Structure==
Natural menthol exists as one pure stereoisomer, nearly always the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;,5&quot;R&quot;) form (bottom left corner of the diagram below). The eight possible stereoisomers are:

In the natural compound, the isopropyl group is in the &quot;trans&quot; orientation to both the methyl and hydroxyl groups. Thus, it can be drawn in any of the ways shown:

The (+)- and (−)-enantiomers of menthol are the most stable among these based on their cyclohexane conformations. With the ring itself in a chair conformation, all three bulky groups can orient in equatorial positions.

The two crystal forms for racemic menthol have melting points of 28 °C and 38 °C. Pure (−)-menthol has four crystal forms, of which the most stable is the α form, the familiar broad needles.

==Biological properties==

Menthol&#x27;s ability to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin is responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it provokes when inhaled, eaten, or applied to the skin. In this sense, it is similar to capsaicin, the chemical responsible for the spiciness of hot chilis (which stimulates heat sensors, also without causing an actual change in temperature).

Menthol&#x27;s analgesic properties are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol blocks calcium channels and voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscles.

Some studies show that menthol acts as a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator and increases GABAergic transmission in PAG neurons. Menthol has anesthetic properties similar to, though less potent than, propofol because it interacts with the same sites on the GABAA receptor. Menthol may also enhance the activity of glycine receptors and negatively modulate 5-HT3 receptors and nAChRs.

Menthol is widely used in dental care as a topical antibacterial agent, effective against several types of streptococci and lactobacilli. Menthol also lowers blood pressure and antagonizes vasoconstriction through TRPM8 activation.

==Occurrence==
&quot;Mentha arvensis&quot; (wild mint) is the primary species of mint used to make natural menthol crystals and natural menthol flakes. This species is primarily grown in the Uttar Pradesh region in India.

Menthol occurs naturally in peppermint oil (along with a little menthone, the ester menthyl acetate and other compounds), obtained from &quot;Mentha × piperita&quot; (peppermint). Japanese menthol also contains a small percentage of the 1-epimer neomenthol.

==Biosynthesis==
The biosynthesis of menthol has been investigated in &quot;Mentha × piperita&quot; and the enzymes involved in have been identified and characterized. It begins with the synthesis of the terpene limonene, followed by hydroxylation, and then several reduction and isomerization steps.

More specifically, the biosynthesis of (−)-menthol takes place in the secretory gland cells of the peppermint plant. The steps of the biosynthetic pathway are as follows:

# Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) first catalyzes the reaction of IPP and DMAPP into geranyl diphosphate.
# (−)-limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate to (−)-limonene.
# (−)-Limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), using O2 and then nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) catalyzes the allylic hydroxylation of (−)-limonene at the 3 position to (−)-trans-isopiperitenol.
# (−)-&quot;trans&quot;-Isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD) further oxidizes the hydroxyl group on the 3 position using NAD+ to make (−)-isopiperitenone.
# (−)-Isopiperitenone reductase (iPR) then reduces the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 using NADPH to form (+)-&quot;cis&quot;-isopulegone.
# (+)-&quot;cis&quot;-Isopulegone isomerase (iPI) then isomerizes the remaining double bond to form (+)-pulegone.
# (+)-Pulegone reductase (PR) reduces this double bond using NADPH to form (−)-menthone.
# (−)-Menthone reductase (MR) then reduces the carbonyl group using NADPH to form (−)-menthol.

==Production==
Natural menthol is obtained by freezing peppermint oil. The resultant crystals of menthol are then separated by filtration.

Total world production of menthol in 1998 was 12,000 tonnes of which 2,500 tonnes was synthetic. In 2005, the annual production of synthetic menthol was almost double. Prices are in the $10–20/kg range with peaks in the $40/kg region but have reached as high as $100/kg. In 1985, it was estimated that China produced most of the world&#x27;s supply of natural menthol, although it appears that India has pushed China into second place.

Menthol is manufactured as a single enantiomer (94% e.e.) on the scale of 3,000 tonnes per year by Takasago International Corporation. The process involves an asymmetric synthesis developed by a team led by Ryōji Noyori, who won the 2001 Nobel Prize for Chemistry in recognition of his work on this process:

The process begins by forming an allylic amine from myrcene, which undergoes asymmetric isomerisation in the presence of a BINAP rhodium complex to give (after hydrolysis) enantiomerically pure &quot;R&quot;-citronellal. This is cyclised by a carbonyl-ene-reaction initiated by zinc bromide to , which is then hydrogenated to give pure (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;,5&quot;R&quot;)-menthol.

Another commercial process is the Haarmann–Reimer process (after the company Haarmann &amp; Reimer, now part of Symrise) This process starts from &quot;m&quot;-cresol which is alkylated with propene to thymol. This compound is hydrogenated in the next step. Racemic menthol is isolated by fractional distillation. The enantiomers are separated by chiral resolution in reaction with methyl benzoate, selective crystallisation followed by hydrolysis.

Racemic menthol can also be formed by hydrogenation of thymol, menthone, or pulegone. In both cases with further processing (crystallizative entrainment resolution of the menthyl benzoate conglomerate) it is possible to concentrate the -enantiomer, however this tends to be less efficient, although the higher processing costs may be offset by lower raw material costs. A further advantage of this process is that -menthol becomes inexpensively available for use as a chiral auxiliary, along with the more usual -antipode.

==Applications==

Menthol is included in many products, and for a variety of reasons.

=== Cosmetic ===
*In some beauty products such as hair conditioners, based on natural ingredients (e.g., St. ⁠Ives).

=== Medical ===
*As an antipruritic to reduce itching.
* As a topical analgesic, it is used to relieve minor aches and pains, such as muscle cramps, sprains, headaches and similar conditions, alone or combined with chemicals such as camphor, eucalyptus oil or capsaicin. In Europe, it tends to appear as a gel or a cream, while in the U.S., patches and body sleeves are very frequently used, e.g.: Tiger Balm, or IcyHot patches or knee/elbow sleeves.
* As a penetration enhancer in transdermal drug delivery.
* Used to cause a subjective feeling of decongestion in nasal inhalers. In decongestants for chest creams and patches). 
** Examples: Vicks VapoRub, Mentholatum, Axe Brand, VapoRem, Mentisan.
* In certain medications used to treat sunburns, as it provides a cooling sensation (then often associated with aloe).
* Commonly used in oral hygiene products and bad-breath remedies, such as mouthwash, toothpaste, mouth and tongue sprays, and more generally as a food flavor agent; such as in chewing gum and candy.
* In first aid products such as &quot;mineral ice&quot; to produce a cooling effect as a substitute for real ice in the absence of water or electricity (pouch, body patch/sleeve or cream).
* In nonprescription products for short-term relief of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation e.g.: lip balms and cough medicines.
* A recent study showed improvement in Alzheimer&#x27;s symptoms and cognition improvements in mice.

=== Others ===
* In aftershave products to relieve razor burn.
* As a smoking tobacco additive in some cigarette brands, for flavor, and to reduce throat and sinus irritation caused by smoking. Menthol also increases nicotine receptor density, increasing the addictive potential of tobacco products.
* As a pesticide against tracheal mites of honey bees.
* In perfumery, menthol is used to prepare menthyl esters to emphasize floral notes (especially rose).
* In various patches ranging from fever-reducing patches applied to children&#x27;s foreheads to &quot;foot patches&quot; to relieve numerous ailments (the latter being much more frequent and elaborate in Asia, especially Japan: some varieties use &quot;functional protrusions&quot;, or small bumps to massage one&#x27;s feet as well as soothing them and cooling them down).
* As an antispasmodic and smooth muscle relaxant in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

=== Organic chemistry ===
In organic chemistry, menthol is used as a chiral auxiliary in asymmetric synthesis. For example, sulfinate esters made from sulfinyl chlorides and menthol can be used to make enantiomerically pure sulfoxides by reaction with organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents. Menthol reacts with chiral carboxylic acids to give diastereomic menthyl esters, which are useful for chiral resolution.
*It can be used as a catalyst for sodium production for the amateur chemist via the alcohol catalysed magnesium reduction process.
*Menthol is potentially ergogenic (performance enhancing) for athletic performance in hot environments

==Reactions==
Menthol reacts in many ways like a normal secondary alcohol. It is oxidised to menthone by oxidising agents such as chromic acid, dichromate, or by calcium hypochlorite, in a green chemistry route. Under some conditions the oxidation using Cr(VI) compounds can go further and break open the ring. Menthol is easily dehydrated to give mainly 3-menthene, by the action of 2% sulfuric acid. Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) gives menthyl chloride.

==History==
In the West, menthol was first isolated in 1771, by the German, Hieronymus David Gaubius. Early characterizations were done by Oppenheim, Beckett, Moriya, and Atkinson. It was named by F. L. Alphons Oppenheim (1833–1877) in 1861.

==Compendial status==
* &quot;United States Pharmacopeia&quot; 23
* Japanese Pharmacopoeia 15
* Food Chemicals Codex

==Safety==
The estimated lethal dose for menthol (and peppermint oil) in humans may be as low as LDformula_1=50–500 mg/kg. In the rat, 3300 mg/kg. In the mouse, 3400 mg/kg. In the cat, 800 mg/kg. 

Survival after doses of 8 to 9 g has been reported. Overdose effects are abdominal pain, ataxia, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, dizziness, lethargy, nausea, skin rash, tremor, vomiting, and vertigo.

<text>Clear Lake (Pomo: &quot;Lypoyomi&quot;) is a natural freshwater lake in Lake County in the U.S. state of California, north of Napa County and San Francisco. It is the largest natural freshwater lake wholly within the state, with of surface area. (Lake Tahoe is partially in Nevada.)
It has an age of nearly 500,000 years. It is the latest lake to occupy a site with a history of lakes stretching back at least 2,500,000 years.

Clear Lake supports large populations of largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, carp and catfish. Two-thirds of the fish caught in Clear Lake are largemouth bass, with a record of . In addition to fish, there is abundant wildlife within the Clear Lake basin. There are year-round populations of ducks, pelicans, grebes, blue herons, egrets, osprey, and bald eagles, and the basin supports sizable populations of deer, bear, mountain lion, raccoon and other animals.

The expansive, warm water of Clear Lake makes it popular for watersports, such as swimming, water skiing, wakeboarding, sailing, boat races, and jet skiing.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;Hok-has-ha&quot;, &quot;Ka-ba-tin&quot;, and &quot;Lupiyoma&quot; are the original names given to Clear Lake by the indigenous people of the region, the Pomo, Lake Miwok and Wappo. In the early 19th century, European American settlers referred to the lake as &quot;Big Lake&quot; or &quot;Laguna&quot;, before finally adopting Clear Lake by the mid-19th century.

==Background and geology==
Clear Lake is by at its widest point, with a surface area of and a capacity. Average depth is , maximum is , lake elevation is , and average water temperature is in winter and in summer.

Clear Lake is believed to be one of the oldest lakes in North America. The lake sits on a huge block of stone which slowly tilts northward at the same rate as the lake fills in with sediment, thus keeping the water at roughly the same depth. Core samples of the lake&#x27;s sediments, taken by U.S. Geological Survey geologists in 1973 and 1980, indicate that the lake is at least 480,000 years old. Some experts feel that Mono Lake, to the east of the Sierra Nevada in California, is older than Clear Lake. However, the sedimentary history of Clear Lake is unbroken, while Mono Lake&#x27;s sediments have been disturbed by past eruptions of the Long Valley Caldera and associated volcanoes.

At one time Clear Lake was even bigger than it is now, and included the Blue Lakes (to the northwest of Clear Lake). Volcanic eruptions and subsequent landslides changed the landscape dramatically, forever separating Clear Lake from the Blue Lakes and from its former westward drainage into the Russian River.

Clear Lake lies within the Clear Lake Volcanic Field, as designated by the United States Geological Survey. The volcanic field contains The Geysers, a steam field which powers a network of the world&#x27;s most productive geothermal power plants. There are numerous small faults present in the south end of the lake as well as many volcanoes, ranging in age from 10,000 to 2.1 million years, the largest being Mount Konocti, sitting at the middle of the lake&#x27;s south shore. There have been no eruptions from the Clear Lake Volcanic Field for thousands of years, but there are indicators currently being monitored that suggest there is the potential for future eruptions. These indicators include volcanic-type earthquakes, hot spring activity and seepage of volcanic gas.

==Weather==
It is not uncommon for temperatures in the summer to rise into the triple digits, or below freezing in the winter. Occasional summer thunderstorms occur but are not common. Snow can fall to lake level but accumulation is rare. Snow on the surrounding mountains is common.

The average high temperature is in summer, and the average low is in winter. Normally, July is the hottest month and December the coldest. December and January are the wettest months, with an average of of rain per month, respectively.

== Recreation ==
With over of shoreline, Clear Lake is a popular spot for water-sports enthusiasts. According to the California Water Board, Clear Lake sees 15,000 recreational boaters per year. There are 11 free boat launch ramps around the lake that are open to the public. Individuals may rent boats and personal watercraft from many businesses around the lake.

Clear Lake is sometimes called the &quot;Bass Capital of the West.&quot; Largemouth bass, which are farmed and planted in the lake by California Department of Fish and Wildlife, crappie, catfish, bluegill, and rainbow trout can be found in the county&#x27;s lakes. Fishing boats can be rented, and many stores and facilities around the lake specialize in fishing equipment. Numerous fishing tournaments and derbies are held throughout the year. In 2016, Clear Lake was ranked by &quot;Bassmaster Magazine&quot; as the #3 best bass lake in the United States and the #1 best bass lake on the West Coast.
All boaters entering Lake County are warned that Dreissenid mussels, also known as quagga and zebra mussels, are a great threat to Clear Lake. By law, boats are required to be inspected before launching, and must have a Lake County Quagga/Zebra (QZ) Sticker on the watercraft. Shops in the vicinity carry out the inspection. At every entry to Lake County, signs warn boaters not to spread hydrilla in the county&#x27;s bodies of water. Extensive management efforts have controlled the presence of hydrilla in Clear Lake, although it may return at any time.

The lake is also the site of an annual &quot;splash-in&quot;, the &quot;oldest and largest seaplane gathering in the Western United States&quot;.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment released an advisory statement regarding eating fish caught from the lake, based on the mercury level.

==Wildlife and vegetation==
The Clear Lake basin attracts large quantities of waterfowl, including mallards, western grebe, coots, various species of geese, ospreys, plovers, mergansers and many others. Wild turkeys, blacktail deer, gray squirrels, ground squirrels, skunks, river otter, raccoon, mink, and muskrat. There have been occasional sightings of mountain lion and ringtail. Opossums, red-tailed hawks, turkey vultures, and other species are also common. The endangered northern spotted owl is seen occasionally. Common reptiles and amphibians include the northwestern pond turtle, California king snake, Pacific gopher snake, garter snakes, northern pacific rattlesnake, common bullfrog and the rare California giant salamander among many others. Much of the shoreline is developed, but parks, reserves, miles of open water and private land also exist allowing many opportunities for observing and enjoying nature. The county also hosts a growing population of the rare tule elk, recently reintroduced after being locally hunted to extinction one hundred years before. A large colony of bald eagles is found in the Cache Creek canyon.

In addition to the native Clear Lake hitch (called &quot;chi&quot; by the native Pomo), the lake hosts channel catfish, white catfish, brown bullhead, crappie (both black and white species), and other native fish species, as well as Florida strain largemouth bass and carp placed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife for sporting purposes. Along the shoreline and creeks, there are aquatic growths of tule, cattail, willow, cottonwood, box elder, and many other types of riparian plant life.

The streams feeding Clear lake contain Sacramento pikeminnow, California roach, and rainbow trout. Pacific lamprey are present in at least one stream, Kelsey Creek. Prior to the construction of a dam on the outlet of Clear Lake, both steelhead and Pacific lamprey ascended Cache creek to spawn in Clear Lake&#x27;s tributaries. 
As of March 2024, farming operations along the Big Valley Groundwater Basin watershed have been ordered to report of their water use by the California State Water Resources Control Board in order to study the effect of groundwater pumping and water diversions on the Clear Lake hitch spawning and migration.

Clear Lake is well known among entomologists for the Clear Lake gnat (&quot;Chaoborus astictopus&quot;) and historical control efforts. This species of &quot;phantom midge&quot; (so called because the larvae are transparent and very difficult to see) measures less than long and resembles a tiny mosquito, but is non-biting. Clear Lake gnat hatches start anytime from March through June, depending on weather. Before pesticide use began in the 1940s, the gnat was so abundant around the lake in the summer that large piles of dead gnats appeared beneath streetlights, looking like dirty snow. The gnat swarms were so thick that people driving along the edge of the lake reported stopping every to clean the insects off the windshields and headlights of their cars so they could see, and pedestrians tied kerchiefs over their faces to avoid inhaling the gnats.

The rugged coastal mountains surrounding Clear Lake are covered with thick stands of oak-madrone forest, manzanita, sage shrubs, chaparral, and grasses. Most common trees include blue oak, valley oak, interior live oak, Pacific madrone, California scrub oak, plus very occasional coast redwoods and tanoak. Large stands of western white pine may be seen in the higher elevations. The heavy forestation and ruggedness of this part of California has helped prevent wholesale real estate development or farming. On the northeast slope of Mount Konocti is a heavily forested area known locally as the &quot;Black Forest&quot; because it never gets direct sunshine. This area has some Douglas fir in very heavy stands.

==History==

Archaeologists believe that the Clear Lake basin has been occupied by Native Americans for at least 11,000 years. (See: Post Pattern.) Evidence of this has been found at nearby Borax Lake and on Rattlesnake Island in the lake&#x27;s south arm. Abundant fish, game and waterbirds made Clear Lake an oasis in the otherwise harsh conditions of Northern California&#x27;s mountains. The native Clear Lake Hitch (&quot;Lavinia exilicauda&quot;) was once so abundant that millions of hitch clogged the lake&#x27;s feeder streams in dry months. When the Spanish missionaries came to California, they found that thousands of Native Americans lived in the Clear Lake Basin, primarily Pomo, Yuki, and Wappo with some Lake Miwok.

European settlers arrived starting around 1845. Frequently they abused and exploited the native Pomo people. A number of Pomo were enslaved and abused by settlers, notably Andrew Kelsey (whose name is attached to the town of Kelseyville) and Charles Stone. The Pomo eventually revolted and killed Kelsey and Stone in 1849. The following year, a United States Army contingent under Lieutenant Nathaniel Lyon cornered as many as 200 Pomo on an island in Clear Lake and slaughtered most of them—including scores of women and children. The historical marker for the Bloody Island massacre is on Highway 20 between Upper Lake and the Robinson Rancheria. The Pomo were later forced to live in small rancherias set aside by the federal government.

Clear Lake was one of the potential water supplies considered in the 1870s by the city of San Francisco, along with Blue Lakes in Alpine County, Lake Merced, Calaveras Valley, Spring Valley Water Works, and Pescadero Creek. The Clear Lake Water Works Company would have built a dam at the current location of the existing one, and piped water through a system of tunnels, canals and reservoirs to the San Pablo Bay. The surveyors reported that the lake&#x27;s &quot;water has a peaty and rather unpleasant flavor&quot;, and that &quot;the condition of the water differed in the upper and lower portions of
the lake&quot;, noting &quot;dead fish floating here and there&quot;.

Clear Lake was used as an outlying seaplane base for Alameda Naval Air Station during World War II and the early years of the Cold War. Flying boats could land on Clear Lake when conditions were unsafe on San Francisco Bay.

In 1977, Proteus Inc, a Berkeley-based company that would eventually become Earthrise Nutritionals, contacted the Clear Lake Algae Research Unit (CLARU), an initiative resulting from the collaboration of the county&#x27;s Flood Control and Water Conservation
District and the California Department of Water Resources. The company expressed interest in the &quot;possibility of harvesting the county&#x27;s algae for sale in specialty markets in Europe and Japan&quot;. The project didn&#x27;t materialize, as harvesting spirulina, the cyanobacteria genus the company was interested in, didn&#x27;t prove economical nor reliable. The company opted instead for algae farming. The Clear Lake Algae Research Unit was disbanded in October 1978 for lack of funding, eight years after its start.

== Hydrology and water rights ==
The Clear Lake Watershed is contained within the Upper Cache Creek USGS hydrologic unit, an area that encompasses . The drainage basin is ( including the lake), which is large compared to the lake&#x27;s . The surface area of the lake is divided into three arms: the Upper Arm, the Oaks Arm and the Lower Arm. Cache Creek, the only outlet for the lake, originates from the Lower Arm. Cache Creek has two major tributaries: North Fork Cache Creek and Bear Creek. The Upper Arm is the largest of the three arms and receives 75% of drainage from the watershed. Rodman Slough, contained within the Upper Arm, receives drainage to its marsh from Scotts Creek and Middle Creek, the largest tributaries to Clear Lake as well as Kelsey Creek, which enters from Big Valley. Erosion and sedimentation are key environmental concerns in the Clear Lake region. Seventy percent of the terrain has very shallow topsoil, which saturates after a rainfall of , after which runoff flows quickly into the lake. The maximum flow from the lake is determined by the narrow canyon of Cache Creek, not by the dam. The combination of rapid inflow and slow outflow results in frequent flooding of low-elevation areas such as downtown Clearlake and Lakeport.

DeWitt Clinton Rumsey, previously a cattle drive &quot;Captain&quot; (and after whom the town of Rumsey in Yolo County was named), was one of the first to record the water levels of Clear Lake. Its level was originally controlled by a rocky ledge in Cache Creek called the &quot;Grigsby Riffle&quot; (which is now submerged upstream of the 1914 dam). In 1872 Rumsey installed a gauge in Lakeport to record the water level. He defined the level when the lake ceased to flow over the ledge as &quot;zero feet Rumsey,&quot; which corresponds to an elevation of . The reading is referred to as being &quot;on the Rumsey Gauge&quot; or &quot;(x) feet Rumsey,&quot; which can fall below zero due to evaporation (over a year) and pumping of water. The highest recorded level is ( in 1890, and the lowest is in 1920. In 1991 a court ruled that the official low water mark (which determines property ownership) is zero feet Rumsey. The Rumsey gauge, now automated, is still in operation.

Yolo County acquired riparian rights to Cache Creek&#x27;s water in 1855, and after gaining water storage rights in 1912 they built the Cache Creek dam. Water companies which rely on the lake have to pay Yolo County for their water. The Gopcevic (1920) and Bemmerly (1942) Decrees prohibited the modification of the Grigsby Riffle, set the normal maximum level of Rumsey, and required Yolo to keep the level below except for limited times during floods. Yolo was entitled to use all the water down to zero feet. The Solano Decree (1978,1995) limited the amount of water Yolo could use: if the lake is &quot;full&quot; on May 1—at Rumsey—then they can draw 150,000 acre-feet, equivalent to a drop in the lake level of about . If the level on May 1 is below they can draw none, with a proportional amount for other levels. They must stop on October 31, or if the level falls to . In compensation, the Indian Valley Reservoir, also entirely in Lake County, was constructed in 1975, and is under the full control of Yolo County.

The northern end of Clear Lake adjacent to Rodman Slough and Middle Creek was blocked off with levees between 1900 and 1940, and the land was reclaimed for agricultural use. During the summer months, Clear Lake provides irrigation flows for agricultural operations in Yolo County. Management of the lakebed is provided by the County of Lake, in accordance with authorities granted by the State Lands Commission in 1973. A project is currently under way to breach the levees and restore of lake and wetland. Bloody Island will again be an island. The additional water resulting from the increased lake area will be allocated to municipal districts drawing water from the lake. Yolo&#x27;s water allowance under the Solano Decree may also be increased.

The management of the lake level is thus designed to avoid flooding, provide water to Yolo County and local water companies, and maintain enough water for recreational use.

Sewage from many Lake County towns no longer flows into the lake; instead, it is pumped to The Geysers geothermal plant.

On September 15, 2014, the lake level fell to on the Rumsey gauge, the lowest level since the 1977 drought. When full, the lake level measures .

==Environmental issues==
=== Agriculture and wetlands ===

The Clear Lake Watershed contains both freshwater marshes and vernal pools. The freshwater marshes are characterized by emergent vegetation including tules and cattails among other species. Ecologists have identified over 1,500 vernal pools in the area, largely located on private lands. The largest remaining wetlands include Anderson Marsh State Park and Rodman Slough. Wetlands in the Clear Lake watershed serve a variety of important ecological functions, including providing habitat for local fish and wildlife, as well as filtering sedimentation entering the lake from streams. Due to increased agricultural and urban land use, Clear Lake&#x27;s historic wetland habitats have been reduced by 79%. Agriculture has been a significant form of land use in the region since the mid-19th century. Analysis of sediment cores drawn from the lake indicate that the increase in sedimentation rates corresponds with an increase in the use of heavy agricultural equipment in the 1930s. Other agricultural activities such as stream channelization, groundwater pumping, application of fertilizers and pesticide use have contributed to lake sedimentation, hillside erosion and floodplain encroachment.

The primary pollutant of concern associated with agriculture in the area is nitrate, with elevated nitrate levels having been identified in the Big Valley area. Agriculture impacts area groundwater sources through pumping, and is responsible for 82% of water usage in the watershed. This usage may contribute to early drying of stream beds, which impacts local wildlife and riparian vegetation.

=== Pesticides ===
In 1949, as part of an effort to boost tourism and improve the local economy, DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) was applied to the lake in heavy doses to eradicate the gnats that were driving summer tourists away from the lake. The treatment succeeded in controlling the gnats that year and for the following year; however, the gnat population rebounded in 1953, prompting another application in 1954. The final application of DDD to Clear Lake was made in 1957 (Cook 1963). Numbers of western grebe were found dead, their tissues containing high concentrations of DDD. The effects were devastating to the local ecology. From 1962 to 1975, carefully planned applications of methyl parathion were made for Clear Lake gnat control. The gnat still occurs in Clear Lake, but at much lower numbers than in the 1940s–1970s. Its population is believed to be kept in check now by two introduced fish species (the threadfin shad and the inland silverside) that compete with the gnat for its preferred zooplankton for food.

=== Invasive species ===

The ecology of Clear Lake has been significantly altered due to the presence of invasive species.

A notable invasive species is hydrilla (&quot;Hydrilla verticillata&quot;), a submerged aquatic plant which notably out-competes both native and non-native species to create pure stands. The plant established so successfully due to its ability to break into smaller propagules, which can survive in sediment for up to seven years. The presence of hydrilla can affect fish stocks, and interfere with recreational boating or fishing. Hydrilla prevention is overseen by the California Department of Food and Agriculture’s Hydrilla Eradication Program, whose goal is the eradication of existing hydrilla populations and prevention of future infestations. The program has been highly successful, managing to keep the lake hydrilla-free for two years before being detected once again in 2019.
Furthermore, the lake has been subjected to a long history of non-native fish introductions. In the 1860s and 1870s, goldfish (&quot;Carassius auratus&quot;) and lake whitefish (&quot;Coregonus clupeaformis&quot;) were some of the first species to be introduced to Clear Lake. Mississippi silverside (&quot;Menidia audens&quot;) were the most abundant fish in the lake soon after their introduction in 1967. Moreover, both the Florida strain largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides floridanus&quot;) and the Northern largemouth bass (&quot;M. salmoides salmoides&quot;) populations of the lake have persisted for decades after introduction.

The lake is also actively monitored for quagga mussels (&quot;Dreissena bugensis&quot;) and zebra mussels (&quot;D. polymorpha&quot;), although there are no established populations of either species in Clear Lake.

=== Harmful algal blooms ===
Due to its shallow depth and warm temperatures, Clear Lake is naturally eutrophic. Written records documenting cloudy discolorations in the lake exist from the late 19th century. Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) in the lake can produce blooms often beginning in the spring and lasting through the fall. Referred to as harmful algal blooms (HAB), these blooms consist of solid mats of scum and are associated with unpleasant odors. Studies have shown that increased nutrient contents, especially in the form of phosphorus, from fertilizer runoff can potentially influence cyanobacteria blooms The California Water Boards have found that phosphorus loading in Clear Lake is largely driven by sedimentation due to erosion from agricultural activities as well as channel erosion, mining activities, wildfires, off-highway vehicle use, and timber harvesting. Harmful algae blooms have been found in the waters of private wells close to the lakeshore.

Types of toxin-producing cyanobacteria that have been identified in Clear Lake include the following genera: &quot;Anabaena&quot;, &quot;Microcystis&quot;, &quot;Oscillatoria&quot;, &quot;Planktothrix&quot;, &quot;Aphanizomenon&quot;, &quot;Cylindrospermopsis&quot;, and &quot;Lyngbya&quot;, all of which can cause short- and long-term health effects. Studies are ongoing to determine the various environmental factors responsible for harmful algal blooms.

===Heavy metal contamination===
The lake is heavily contaminated with mercury from the nearby Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine. The abandoned mine was declared a Superfund site in the early 1990s and is still undergoing clean-up. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife presently recommends that women of child-bearing age and children do not consume certain fish from Clear Lake, due to the presence of methylmercury compounds in lake sediments.

=== Monitoring, mitigation, and restoration ===
Clear Lake has been identified as an impaired water body under Section 303(d)(1)(A) of the Clean Water Act. This designation indicates that the water body does not comply with applicable water quality standards. As such, the area is required to comply with quality management strategies such as Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) to satisfy federal regulatory requirements. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board has identified point sources of pollution in Clear Lake as Caltrans and storm water permitees. Nonpoint sources of pollution in Clear Lake include the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, irrigated agriculture, and the County of Lake The lake and the surrounding watershed are being monitored through sampling of gauges placed by the California Department of Water Resources.
The Middle Creek Project was started in 1995 by Lake County to restore native wetlands to the Clear Lake area. The project set a goal of expanding the current wetlands area to double its current size. Lake County has additionally ensured no further loss of wetlands by the passage of the County Shoreline Ordinance which prohibits the removal of wetland vegetation on private property. 
In 2009 the Middle Creek and Hamilton City Flood Damage Restoration and Ecosystem Act (AB74) was signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The project was to provide funding to breach the levees and restore of lake and wetland. Bloody Island should again be an island. The project has the additional aim of reducing the amount of phosphorus entering the lake by 40%. The additional water resulting from the increased lake area is to be allocated to municipal districts drawing water from the lake. Yolo&#x27;s water allowance under the Solano decree may also be increased.

The passage of Assembly Bill 707 allowed for the creation of the Blue Ribbon Committee for the Rehabilitation of Clear Lake. The committee is made up of 15 county-appointed members from tribes, universities and various governmental organizations. The committee is charged with providing scientifically sound recommendations for the management of Clear Lake&#x27;s &quot;economy, ecosystem, and heritage&quot;. 
A Cyanobacteria Task Force was formed in 2014 which includes the Big Valley, Elem, Scotts Valley and Robinson tribes, as well as various state and federal governmental agencies. The task force focuses primarily on monitoring activities, particularly water sampling and testing for toxins. 
Various local ordinances protect the lake from land-use practices in the domesticated areas of the surrounding watershed, and the lake&#x27;s water quality impairments are addressed by federal and state regulatory programs. Multiple water suppliers in communities surrounding the lake provide potable water for municipal uses in accordance with California&#x27;s public health regulations.

Lake County participates in the state&#x27;s Department of Water Resources&#x27; Integrated Regional Water Management programs, within the Westside Region including Lake, Colusa, Napa, Solano, and Yolo counties. The Lake County Watershed Protection District is the lead agency for Lake County&#x27;s participation in the Westside Region&#x27;s long-term (2013–2033) water management programs. Within the jurisdictional boundary of the County of Lake, the Watershed Protection District provides the &quot;Lake County Clean Water Program&quot; for compliance with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) pollution prevention programs, and with the NPDES stormwater management permit (issued by the State Water Resources Control Board as Water Quality Order 2013-0001-DWQ), by implementing the Lake County &quot;Stormwater Management Plan&quot;.

Lake County also complies with the NPDES aquatic pesticide permit program, allowing licensed pesticide applicators to eradicate nuisance aquatic weeds, in accordance with the &quot;Clear Lake Integrated Aquatic Plant Management Plan&quot;. Multi-jurisdictional programs for natural resource management in the Clear Lake watershed—including federal, state, and local land owners in the County of Lake—are described in the &quot;Clear Lake Integrated Watershed Management Plan&quot;.

<text>Baron Aberconway, of Bodnant in the County of Denbigh, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 21 June 1911 for the industrialist and Liberal politician Sir Charles McLaren, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a baronet, of Bodnant, Gwylgre and Hilders, on 24 July 1902.

His eldest son, the second Baron, was a businessman and also sat as a Member of Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. In August 1939, the future third Baron was part of a secret delegation sent to Germany by Lord Halifax to offer Adolf Hitler concessions on the assurance that he would not invade Poland. Since 2003, the title passed to his eldest son, the fourth Baron. 

Aberconway is the anglicised form of the Welsh place name Aberconwy, the original name of Conwy town in Welsh.

The family seat is Bodnant House, near Tal-y-Cafn, Conwy, Wales. The traditional burial place of the Lords Aberconway is a mausoleum called &quot;The Poem&quot; within Bodnant Garden.

==Barons Aberconway (1911)==
* Charles Benjamin Bright McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway (1850–1934)
* Henry Duncan McLaren, 2nd Baron Aberconway (1879–1953)
* Charles Melville McLaren, 3rd Baron Aberconway (1913–2003)
* Henry Charles McLaren, 4th Baron Aberconway (born 1948)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son, Charles Stephen McLaren (born 1984).

<text>Sean Patrick Hannity (born December 30, 1961) is an American conservative television presenter, broadcaster and writer. He hosts &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot;, a nationally syndicated talk radio show, has hosted a self-titled political commentary program on Fox News since 2009, and co-hosted the original Fox News debate show &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; with Alan Colmes from the network&#x27;s founding in 1996 to 2009.

Hannity worked as a general contractor and volunteered as a talk show host at UC Santa Barbara in 1989. He later joined WVNN in Athens, Alabama, and shortly afterward, WGST in Atlanta. After leaving WGST, he worked at WABC in New York until 2013. Since 2014, Hannity has worked at WOR. In 1996, Hannity and Alan Colmes co-hosted &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; on Fox. After Colmes announced his departure in January 2008, Hannity merged the &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; show into &quot;Hannity&quot;.

Hannity has said he is not a journalist, and he has been characterized as a propagandist. He has promoted conspiracy theories, such as &quot;birtherism&quot; (claims that then-President Barack Obama was not a legitimate U.S. citizen), falsehoods about Hillary Clinton&#x27;s health, and false claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Hannity was an early supporter of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and often acted as an unofficial spokesman for him. When Trump was president, White House advisors characterized Hannity as the &quot;shadow&quot; chief of staff, and he reportedly phoned the White House and spoke to Trump most weeknights. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, by 2018 Hannity had become one of the most-watched hosts in cable news and most-listened-to hosts in talk radio, due in part to his closeness and access to Trump. He privately urged Trump administration officials before and during the January 6 United States Capitol attack to cease some of their efforts to retain the presidency and to urge Trump&#x27;s supporters to leave the Capitol. Hannity was among the hosts named in the &quot;Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network&quot; defamation lawsuit for broadcasting false statements about the plaintiff company&#x27;s voting machines that Fox News settled for $787.5 million and required Fox News to acknowledge that the broadcast statements were false.

Hannity has an honorary degree from Liberty University. He won awards from the National Association of Broadcasters in 2003 and 2007. He has written three &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling books: &quot;Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism&quot; (2002), &quot;Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism&quot; (2004), and &quot;Conservative Victory: Defeating Obama&#x27;s Radical Agenda&quot; (2010), and released a fourth, &quot;Live Free or Die&quot;, in 2020.
== Early life and education ==
Hannity was born in New York City, New York, the son of Lillian (née Flynn) and Hugh Hannity. Lillian worked as a stenographer and a corrections officer at a county jail, while Hugh was a World War II veteran and family-court officer. He was the youngest of four siblings and the only boy. All his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ireland. He grew up in Franklin Square, New York on Long Island.

In his youth, Hannity worked as a paperboy delivering issues of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Long Island Daily Press&quot;. His parents were initially supporters of President John F. Kennedy, eventually growing more Republican in their views as time went on, though they resisted being overtly political at home.

Hannity attended Sacred Heart Seminary in Hempstead, New York and St. Pius X Preparatory Seminary in Uniondale, New York. He attended New York University and Adelphi University, but did not graduate from either.

== Career ==
In 1982, Hannity started a house-painting business and a few years later, worked as a building contractor in Santa Barbara, California. He hosted his first talk radio show in 1989 at the volunteer college station at UC Santa Barbara, KCSB-FM, while working as a general contractor. The show aired for 40 hours of air time. Regarding his first show, he said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t good at it. I was terrible.&quot;

=== Radio ===
Hannity&#x27;s weekly show on KCSB was canceled after less than a year after a controversy. During two shows, gay and lesbian rights were discussed in what was considered to be a contentious manner. (See LGBT issues below.) The university board that governed the station later reversed its decision after a campaign conducted on Hannity&#x27;s behalf by the Santa Barbara chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the station had discriminated against Hannity&#x27;s First Amendment rights. When the station refused to issue Hannity a public apology and more airtime, he did not return to KCSB.

After leaving KCSB, Hannity placed an advertisement in radio publications, presenting himself as &quot;the most talked about college radio host in America&quot;. Radio station WVNN in Athens, Alabama (part of the Huntsville media market), then hired him to be the afternoon talk show host. From Huntsville, he moved to WGST in Atlanta in 1992, filling the slot vacated by Neal Boortz, who had moved to competing station WSB. In September 1996, Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes hired the then relatively unknown Hannity to host a television program under the working title &quot;Hannity and LTBD&quot; (&quot;liberal to be determined&quot;). Alan Colmes was then hired to co-host and the show debuted as &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;.

Later that year, Hannity left WGST for New York, where WABC had him substitute for their afternoon drive time host during Christmas week. In January 1997, WABC put Hannity on the air full-time, giving him the late-night time slot. WABC then moved Hannity to the same drive-time slot he had filled temporarily a little more than a year earlier. Hannity was on WABC&#x27;s afternoon time slot from January 1998.

In their 2007 book &quot;Common Ground: How to Stop the Partisan War That Is Destroying America&quot;, conservative Cal Thomas and liberal Bob Beckel describe Hannity as a leader of the pack among broadcasting political polarizers, which following James Q. Wilson they define as those who have &quot;an intense commitment to a candidate, a culture, or an ideology that sets people in one group definitively apart from people in another, rival group&quot;. The WABC slot continued until the end of 2013. Since January 2014, Hannity has hosted the 3:00–6:00p.m. time slot on WOR in New York City.
Hannity&#x27;s radio program is a conservative political talk show that features Hannity&#x27;s opinions and ideology related to current issues and politicians. &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; began national syndication on September 10, 2001, on more than five hundred stations nationwide. In 2004, Hannity signed a $25million five-year contract extension with ABC Radio (now Citadel Media) to continue the show until 2009. The program was made available via Armed Forces Radio Network in 2006. In June 2007, ABC Radio was sold to Citadel Communications and in the summer of 2008, Hannity was signed for a $100million five-year contract. As of March 2018, the program is heard by more than 13.5 million listeners a week. Hannity was ranked No.2 in &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 2017 Heavy Hundred and was listed as No.72 on &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; &quot;Celebrity 100&quot; list in 2013.

In January 2007, Clear Channel Communications signed a groupwide three-year extension with Hannity on more than eighty stations. The largest stations in the group deal included KTRH Houston, KFYI Phoenix, WPGB Pittsburgh, WKRC Cincinnati, WOOD Grand Rapids, WFLA Tampa, WOAI San Antonio, WLAC Nashville, and WREC Memphis.

Hannity signed a long-term contract to remain with Premiere Networks in September 2013.

At the beginning of 2014, Hannity signed contracts to air on several Salem Communications stations including WDTK Detroit, WIND Chicago, WWRC (now WQOF) Washington, D.C., and KSKY Dallas.

=== Television ===
Hannity was a co-host of &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, an American political &quot;point-counterpoint&quot;-style television program on the Fox News Channel featuring Hannity and Alan Colmes as co-hosts. Hannity presented the conservative point of view with Colmes providing the liberal viewpoint.

While Hannity&#x27;s views are typically politically and socially conservative, he has spoken supportively about birth control, which has led to on-air clashes with pro-life guests such as Rev. Thomas Euteneuer, president of Human Life International. Hannity said if the Catholic Church were to excommunicate him over his support for contraception, he would join Jerry Falwell&#x27;s Thomas Road Baptist Church.

In January 2007, Hannity began a new Sunday night television show on Fox News, &quot;Hannity&#x27;s America&quot;.

In November 2008, Colmes announced his departure from &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;. After the show&#x27;s final broadcast on January 9, 2009, Hannity took over the time slot with his own new show, &quot;Hannity&quot;, which has a format similar to &quot;Hannity&#x27;s America&quot;.

=== Books ===

Hannity is the author of four books. &quot;Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism&quot; was published in 2002, and &quot;Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism&quot; was published in 2004 through ReganBooks. Both these books reached the nonfiction &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, the second of which stayed there for five weeks. Hannity has said he is too busy to write many books, and dictated a lot of his own two books into a tape recorder while driving in to do his radio show.

Hannity wrote his third book, &quot;Conservative Victory: Defeating Obama&#x27;s Radical Agenda&quot;, which was released by HarperCollins in March 2010. The book became Hannity&#x27;s third &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller.

In 2020, Hannity released his fourth book, &quot;Live Free or Die&quot;.

=== Freedom Concerts ===
From 2003 until 2010, Hannity hosted country music-themed &quot;Freedom Concerts&quot; to raise money for charity. In 2010, conservative blogger Debbie Schlussel wrote that only a small percentage of the money raised by the concerts goes to the target charity, Freedom Alliance. The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also in 2010. The FTC complaint alleges that Hannity was &quot;falsely promoting that all concert proceeds would be donated to a scholarship fund for the children of those killed or wounded in war&quot;. The complaint filed with the IRS claims that Freedom Alliance has violated its 501(c)(3) charity status. The concerts stopped around the same year.

=== Awards and honors ===
*Hannity received a Marconi Award in 2003 and 2007 as the Network Syndicated Personality of the Year from the National Association of Broadcasters.
*In 2009, &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; listed Hannity as No.2 on their list of the 100 most important radio talk show hosts in America (with Rush Limbaugh listed as No.1). The same magazine gave Hannity its Freedom of Speech Award in 2003.
*In 2005, Jerry Falwell, chancellor of the evangelical Liberty University, awarded Hannity an honorary degree.
*Hannity was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in November 2017.

=== Other activities ===
Hannity has had cameo appearances in film and television, having a brief voiceover in &quot;The Siege&quot; as an unseen reporter, and appearing in &quot;Atlas Shrugged: Part II&quot; and the second season of &quot;House of Cards&quot; as himself. He executive produced and appeared in the 2017 film &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;, which also stars Kevin Sorbo.

As of April 2018, Hannity owned at least 877 residential properties, which were bought for nearly $89million. He purchased some of the homes with the help of loans from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and most are in working-class neighborhoods. His property managers have taken an aggressive management approach with a much higher than average eviction rate. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that his property management team has used eviction proceedings both to remove tenants and to generate revenue. His property managers have claimed that Hannity has no active role in the management of the more than 1,000 properties he has a stake in.

== Views ==

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hannity &quot;repeatedly embraces storylines that prove to be inaccurate&quot; and takes positions that change over time. In the opinion of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hannity is &quot;barreling headfirst into the murky territory between opinion and out-and-out conspiracy theorism&quot;. Hannity often promotes conspiracy theories without explicitly endorsing them, unlike Alex Jones. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that this &quot;has the effect of nourishing the more wild-eyed beliefs of his fans while providing Hannity a degree of plausible deniability&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote in 2019 that Hannity had &quot;[spewed] baseless conspiracy theories with impunity&quot;.

During the Bush years, Hannity &quot;loyally supported the president&#x27;s policies&quot;. During the Obama administration, Hannity &quot;leaned more heavily on stories he believed were being given short shrift by the &#x27;liberal media&#x27;stories about where Obama was born, and who deserved blame for the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya&quot;. In 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;what Hannity has stood forat least for the past couple of yearsis Trump.&quot;

===Donald Trump===

==== Candidacy of Donald Trump ====
Hannity is known for his pro-Trump coverage. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Hannity&#x27;s comeback coincided with his early, eager embrace of his fellow New Yorker... Trump attacked the Gold Star father, and Hannity stood by him. Trump went after a federal judge of Mexican descent, and Hannity backed him. After the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape emerged of Trump making lewd comments about inappropriate sexual behaviour towards women, Hannity continued to defend him: &#x27;King David had 500 concubines, for crying out loud.&#x27;&quot; After the inauguration, the first interview the new president gave to a cable news channel was conducted by Hannity. Hannity additionally defended the Trump administration&#x27;s false claim that Trump&#x27;s inauguration crowd was the biggest ever.

Hannity has been criticized as being overly favorable to the candidacy of Trump and granting him more airtime than other presidential candidates during the 2016 primaries. Hannity, for instance, let Trump promote the false claim that Rafael Cruz, father of Trump&#x27;s rival presidential candidate Ted Cruz, was involved in the John F. Kennedy assassination. He admitted to favoring Republican candidates, though without indicating a preference for Donald Trump over Ted Cruz. According to Dylan Byers of CNN, Hannity during interviews &quot;frequently cites areas where he agrees with Trump, or where he thinks Trump was right about something, then asks him to expand on it&quot;, and &quot;often ignores or defends Trump from criticism&quot;.

Tensions between Cruz and Hannity appeared to reach a boiling point during a contentious April 2016 radio interview, during which Cruz implied Hannity was a &quot;hardcore Donald Trump supporter&quot; and Hannity responded by accusing Cruz of &quot;throw[ing] this in my face&quot; every time he asked a &quot;legitimate question&quot;. Jim Rutenberg commented in August 2016 that Hannity is &quot;not only Mr. Trump&#x27;s biggest media booster; he also veers into the role of adviser,&quot; citing sources who said Hannity spent months offering suggestions to Trump and his campaign on strategy and messaging. Hannity responded to the report by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not hiding the fact that I want Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States... I never claimed to be a journalist.&quot; (In an article published in December 2017, Hannity said &quot;I&#x27;m a journalist. But I&#x27;m an advocacy journalist, or an opinion journalist.&quot;) Hannity also appeared in a 2016 Trump campaign ad. Hannity has feuded with several conservatives who oppose Trump, including &quot;National Review&quot;″s Jonah Goldberg, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens, and &quot;National Review&quot; editor Rich Lowry.

==== Relationships with Donald Trump, Michael Cohen and other officials ====
Hannity developed a close relationship with Trump during the election and became even closer during his presidency. The two men spoke on the phone multiple times a week, discussing Hannity&#x27;s weekday show, the special counsel investigation, even evaluating White House staff. Hannity shares, &quot;The Economist&quot; asserts, &quot;Mr. Trump&#x27;s love of conspiracy theories and hatred of snooty elites&quot;. They speak so often that one Trump adviser has said Hannity &quot;basically has a desk in the place&quot;. On the air, Hannity echoes Trump&#x27;s attacks on the media and Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Trump sometimes quotes Hannity to others or promotes the show to his Twitter followers. Hannity has encouraged Trump to shut down the government to get funding for a border wall, as well as his declaration of a national emergency over the US–Mexico border.

According to reports by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Hannity frequently talks to Trump by telephone after Hannity&#x27;s weekday broadcasts, and Hannity is one of several dozen cleared callers whose calls to the White House public switchboard can be connected directly to the president.

Hannity stirred controversy in April 2018 when it was revealed that he shared a lawyer, Michael Cohen, with Trump. In a breach of journalistic ethics, Hannity had failed to disclose that Cohen was his lawyer while at the same time taking to the Fox airwaves to defend Cohen and criticize those who investigated him.

On April 9, 2018, federal agents from the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office served a search warrant on the office and residence of Michael Cohen, Trump&#x27;s personal attorney. On the air, Hannity defended Cohen and criticized the federal action, calling it &quot;highly questionable&quot; and &quot;an unprecedented abuse of power&quot;. On April 16, 2018, in a court hearing, Cohen&#x27;s lawyers told the judge that Cohen had ten clients in 2017–2018 but did &quot;traditional legal tasks&quot; for only three: Trump, Elliott Broidy, and a &quot;prominent person&quot; who did not wish to be named for fear of being &quot;embarrassed&quot;. The federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client, whom Cohen&#x27;s lawyers named as Hannity. Although Hannity has covered Cohen on his show, he did not disclose that he had consulted with Cohen.

Fox News released a statement on April 16, 2018, attributed to Hannity: &quot;Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective. I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third party.&quot; Also, NBC News quoted Hannity as saying: &quot;We definitely had attorney–client privilege because I asked him for that,&quot; while Hannity said on his radio show that he &quot;might have handed him ten bucks&quot; for the attorney-client privilege. Lastly, Hannity tweeted that his discussions with Cohen were &quot;almost exclusively&quot; about real estate.

The following day, news reports revealed that Hannity had shared another lawyer with Trump, Jay Sekulow. Sekulow had written a cease-and-desist letter to KFAQ on Hannity&#x27;s behalf in May 2017, and later represented Trump in connection with the Mueller investigation.

In August 2018, Hannity allowed Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani, another personal lawyer for Trump, to host Hannity&#x27;s radio show; the duo proceeded to defend Trump and promote arguments made by the Trump administration.

In June 2019, Hannity expressed outrage at Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s comment that she would like to see Trump &quot;in prison&quot;. Hannity declared: &quot;Based on no actual crimes, she wants a political opponent locked up in prison? That happens in banana republicsbeyond despicable behavior.&quot; Aaron Rupar of &quot;Vox&quot; criticized Hannity for &quot;obvious hypocrisy&quot;, noting that Hannity himself had said in January 2018 regarding Hillary Clinton: &quot;I think Hillary should be in jail. Lock her up.&quot; Aaron Blake of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Hannity&#x27;s comment as &quot;a pretty obvious bit of gaslighting&quot;, noting Hannity&#x27;s loyalty to Trump, whose campaign rallies have featured chants of &quot;Lock her up&quot;, and also Hannity&#x27;s comments that Trump was free to investigate Clinton.

Hannity played the most important role in persuading Trump to pardon the convicted murderer and war criminal Clint Lorance.

After Trump lost the 2020 election, Hannity sent a number of text messages offering advice to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, including a message apparently suggesting a joint &quot;NC Real estate&quot; venture with him.

In October 2023, a staffer on his show emailed Republican lawmakers asking why they weren&#x27;t supporting Representative Jim Jordan, Donald Trump&#x27;s choice for House Speaker to replace Representative Kevin McCarthy.

=== Conspiracy theories ===

==== 2016 election and Seth Rich ====
During the 2016 presidential election, Hannity periodically promoted conspiracy theories regarding Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Hannity repeatedly claimed that Clinton had very serious medical problems and that the media was covering them up. He misrepresented photos of Clinton to give the impression that she had secret medical problems. He shared a photo from the fake news site Gateway Pundit and falsely claimed that it showed her Secret Service agent holding a diazepam pen intended to treat seizures, when he in fact was holding a small flashlight. He booked doctors on his show to discuss Clinton&#x27;s health; although these people had never personally examined Clinton, they made alarmist statements about her state of health which turned out to be false. At one point, Hannity promoted an unsubstantiated report that Clinton had been drunk at a rally; at another point, he suggested that Clinton was drunk and that her campaign needed to &quot;sober her up&quot;.

Although Hannity said he believed President Obama was born in the U.S., to answer queries on Obama&#x27;s citizenship, he repeatedly called on Obama to release his birth certificate. Hannity described the circumstances regarding Obama&#x27;s birth certificate as &quot;odd&quot;. Hannity also defended and promoted those who questioned Obama&#x27;s citizenship of the U.S., such as Donald Trump. Hannity invited Trump to his show while Trump was a leader in the birther movement; during an interview with Hannity, Trump said Obama &quot;could have easily have come from Kenya, or someplace&quot;. Hannity said in response, &quot;The issue could go away in a minute. Just show the certificate.&quot; Even after Obama produced his birth certificate in 2008, certified by the state of Hawaii, Hannity kept calling on Obama to release his birth certificate, asking why did he not &quot;just produce it and we move on?&quot; In October 2016, Hannity offered to purchase a one-way ticket to Kenya for Obama.

In May 2017, Hannity became a prominent promoter of the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had a DNC staffer killed. Shortly afterward, he faced backlash from news sources across the political spectrum and lost several advertisers, including Crowne Plaza Hotels, Cars.com, Leesa Mattress, USAA, Peloton and Casper Sleep deciding to pull their marketing from his program on Fox News. However, USAA decided to return to the show shortly after following a negative outcry against its decision to pull out. Conservative magazine &quot;National Review&quot; compared the story to a flat earth video, called it a &quot;disgrace&quot; that Hannity and other conspiracy theorists were hyping the story, and called for them to stop.

In March 2018, Seth Rich&#x27;s parents filed a lawsuit against Fox News for pushing conspiracy theories about their son&#x27;s death. The suit alleges that the network &quot;intentionally exploited&quot; the tragedy for political purposes. On October 12, 2020, Fox News agreed to pay millions of dollars to the Rich family.

Hannity came under criticism during the 2016 presidential election for false claims about election rigging during interviews. Hannity responded to this by citing Mitt Romney&#x27;s failure in the 2012 United States presidential election to obtain any votes in 59 of 1,687 Philadelphia voting districts as proof of election rigging. However, FactCheck.org and PolitiFact found that it was not unusual at all for this to occur, as those electoral districts are heavily African-American. Philadelphia elections inspector Ryan Godfrey also refuted Hannity&#x27;s claim.

==== 2020 election ====
After the 2020 election, Hannity amplified false claims of election fraud, including by hosting former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell on his Fox News show, where Powell made unsubstantiated allegations on the topic. The House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack investigated what Hannity may have known in advance. The committee discovered that, on December 31, 2020, Hannity texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, saying, &quot;I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he [Trump] is being told.&quot; In December 2020, Hannity called for Trump&#x27;s claims of voter fraud to be investigated by a special prosecutor, despite no credible evidence of such. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in May 2022 that Hannity participated in a conference call days after the 2020 presidential election that focused on strategies for challenging the legitimacy of the vote. Other participants on the call included senator Lindsey Graham, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow, Oracle Corporation founder Larry Ellison and James Bopp, an attorney for True the Vote.

Fox News was sued for defamation in 2021 by Dominion Voting Systems, after Hannity and other network hosts and their guests promoted claims the company&#x27;s voting machines had been rigged against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Shortly after the election, Hannity hosted Trump attorney Sidney Powell, who made such assertions, but Hannity said in a sworn deposition for the Dominion case, &quot;I did not believe it for one second.&quot;

==== &quot;Deep state&quot; ====
Hannity has advocated the &quot;deep state&quot; conspiracy theory. It proposes a government officials network is working to hinder the Trump administration. He has described the deep state as a &quot;Shadow Government&quot; and &quot;Deep state swamp of Obama holdovers and DC lifers&quot;. In March 2017, he called for a &quot;purge&quot; of Obama-era bureaucrats and appointees in government. In an op-ed for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, conservative columnist Bret Stephens disputed Hannity&#x27;s deep state allegations, saying they were an example of the &quot;paranoid style in politics&quot;. Later that month, Hannity said NBC News was part of the deep state. In May 2017, he reiterated that deep state/intelligence operatives were trying to destroy the Trump presidency.

===2012 Benghazi attack===
Analysis of Fox News coverage published by Media Matters in 2014 found that Hannity was a major proponent of alleged scandals involving the Obama administration and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Six
investigations by Republican-controlled House committees found no evidence of scandal.

=== WikiLeaks ===
In 2010, Hannity said WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was waging a &quot;war&quot; on the United States, and that WikiLeaks put American lives in &quot;jeopardy&quot; and &quot;danger&quot; around the world. He also criticized the Obama administration for failing to apprehend Assange. In 2016, after WikiLeaks published leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee, Hannity praised Assange for showing &quot;how corrupt, dishonest and phony our government is&quot;. He told Assange in a September 2016 interview, &quot;I do hope you get free one day. I wish you the best.&quot; The following month, Hannity claimed that WikiLeaks has revealed &quot;everything that conspiracy theorists have said over the years&quot; about Hillary Clinton is true.

In February 2017, Hannity retweeted a WikiLeaks tweet linking to an article by the conspiracy website Gateway Pundit, claiming that John McCain was a &quot;globalist war criminal&quot;. McCain&#x27;s spokeswoman called Hannity out on it, asking him to &quot;correct the record&quot;. Hannity later deleted the tweet. In May 2017, Hannity made an offer to Assange to guest host his Fox News TV show.

=== Criticism of FBI, DOJ, and special counsel ===
During President Trump&#x27;s administration, Hannity has repeatedly been highly critical of the FBI, DOJ, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and others investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. According to a review by &quot;Media Matters&quot; of all transcripts from the 254 episodes of Hannity&#x27;s show from Mueller&#x27;s appointment (May 17, 2017) to May 16, 2018, Hannity had 487 segments substantially devoted to Mueller (approximately two per episode), opened his program with Mueller 152 times (approximately three times per week), and the content of his show was highly critical of the probe and the media&#x27;s coverage of the probe. He has called the Russia inquiry a &quot;witch hunt&quot;, an &quot;utter disgrace&quot;, and &quot;a direct threat to you, the American people, and our American republic&quot;. Hannity has expressed skepticism of the U.S. intelligence community&#x27;s view that Russia hacked the Democratic National Convention&#x27;s emails during the 2016 election and has promoted various conspiracy theories. In March 2017 he publicized a theory, first proposed at the WikiLeaks Twitter account, that the CIA could have done the hacking while making it look like Russia did it. In August he suggested that Seth Rich may have been the leaker. Hannity falsely claimed fewer people voted for Trump in the 2016 election because they heard about the &quot;pee tape&quot; rumor, which he called &quot;election interference&quot;, even though it was not public knowledge until 63 days after the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karet_3/19/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannity has described the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as James Comey&#x27;s tenure as FBI Director, as &quot;one giant incestuous circle of corruption&quot;. In April 2018, Hannity ran a segment where he claimed there were &quot;criminal&quot; connections between Bill and Hillary Clinton, Mueller, and Comey. Hannity asserted that there were three connected &quot;Deep State crime families&quot; actively &quot;trying to take down the president&quot;. A guest on the segment, attorney Joseph diGenova, called Mueller&#x27;s team &quot;legal terrorists&quot; and referred to Comey as a &quot;dirty cop&quot;. In March 2018, Hannity attacked Special Counsel Robert Mueller, saying his career was &quot;anything but impeccable&quot;. Hannity said Mueller was friends with former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and that he &quot;cannot be expected to honestly investigate scandals that his friends are directly involved in&quot;. He said these individuals were involved in &quot;one massive, huge, deep-state conflict of interest after another. Now they&#x27;re protecting themselves. They&#x27;re trying to preserve their own power.&quot; Mueller and Comey are professional acquaintances but not known to be friends, while Trump attorney general Bill Barr said in 2019 that he and Mueller had been friends for thirty years.

On November 4, 2018, Trump&#x27;s website, DonaldJTrump.com, announced in a press release that Hannity would make a &quot;special guest appearance&quot; with Trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The following morning, Hannity tweeted &quot;To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President.&quot; Hannity nevertheless spoke at Trump&#x27;s lectern on stage at the rally, immediately mocking the &quot;fake news&quot; at the back of the auditorium, Fox News reporters among them. Several Fox News employees expressed outrage at Hannity&#x27;s actions, with one stating, &quot;a new line was crossed&quot;. Hannity later asserted that his action was not pre-planned, and Fox News stated it &quot;does not condone any talent participating in campaign events&quot;. Fox News host Jeanine Pirro also appeared on stage with Trump at the rally. The Trump press release was later removed from Trump&#x27;s website.

Hannity also claimed that Mueller had been involved in the corrupt dealings of several FBI agents in connection with Boston, Massachusetts crime boss Whitey Bulger. The federal judge who presided over a lawsuit concerning the corrupt dealings said Hannity&#x27;s claims were unsubstantiated and that Mueller was never accused of any wrongdoing nor even mentioned during the proceedings.

In June 2018, after reports that Mueller&#x27;s probe had asked witnesses to turn their personal phones over to investigators for examination, Hannity sarcastically suggested on air to the witnesses that they &quot;follow Hillary Clinton&#x27;s lead&quot; and destroy their personal phones so they cannot be examined.

In May 2019, after Mueller gave a statement saying the Special Counsel investigation did not exonerate Trump of crimes, Hannity said Mueller was &quot;basically full of crap&quot; and did not know the law.

=== Comments on sexual harassment ===
In 2016, Hannity vociferously defended Roger Ailes when he was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment. In May 2017, Hannity paid a tribute to Ailes after he died. Hannity called him &quot;a second father&quot; and said to Ailes&#x27; &quot;enemies&quot; that he was &quot;preparing to kick your in the next life&quot;.

In April 2017, Hannity came to the defense of Fox News co-president Bill Shine after it was reported that Shine&#x27;s job was at risk. At least four lawsuits alleged that Shine had ignored, enabled or concealed Ailes&#x27; alleged sexual harassment.

In another lawsuit, he was accused of belittling a female guest on his TV show, allegedly offering cash to anyone on set who would take her on a date.

In September 2017, several months after Bill O&#x27;Reilly was fired from Fox News in the wake of a number of women&#x27;s alleging that he had sexually harassed them, Hannity hosted O&#x27;Reilly on his show. Some Fox News employees criticized the decision. In the interview, O&#x27;Reilly attacked liberal media watchdog groups and said he should have fought harder when those groups targeted his advertisers. According to CNN, during the interview, Hannity found kinship with O&#x27;Reilly as he appeared &quot;to feel that he and O&#x27;Reilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them&quot;.

Hannity came under criticism in October 2017 when he attacked Democrats after it became known that a large number of women had accused Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer and donor to Democratic causes, of sexual harassment. Critics noted that Hannity had weeks earlier defended and hosted his coworker Bill O&#x27;Reilly who was fired following a number of sexual harassment allegations.

=== LGBT rights ===
In the radio show for KCSB, which was the subject of controversy in 1989, Hannity made anti-gay comments. He called AIDS a &quot;gay disease&quot; and said the media was hiding salient information from the public. Two editions featured anti-gay activist Gene Antonio, a Lutheran minister, discussing his book &quot;The AIDS Coverup: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS&quot;. In the book, Antonio claims that AIDS can be spread by people sneezing in close proximity to each other. Hannity encouraged Antonio when he said that AIDS spread when gay men consumed each other&#x27;s feces, said that homosexuality was a &quot;lower form of behavior&quot;, compared homosexual sex to &quot;playing in a sewer&quot; and gay people of being &quot;filled with hatred and bigotry&quot;. When a lesbian, another broadcaster at the station, called into the show, Hannity said &quot;I feel sorry for your child.&quot; Hannity was quoted at the time as having said &quot;anyone listening to this show that believes homosexuality is a normal lifestyle has been brainwashed.&quot; The ACLU opposed his firing and petitioned the station to reverse their decision. Hannity demanded a formal apology and double the airtime. While the station did offer to allow Hannity to return, they would not meet Hannity&#x27;s additional demands and he declined to return.

In 2017, Hannity said he regretted the comments and that they were &quot;ignorant and embarrassing&quot;.

=== Immigration ===
Hannity opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants; however, in 2012 he said he had evolved on the issue and favored a &quot;pathway to citizenship&quot;. Later, he opposed that idea. By 2018, he was described as an immigration hardliner by CNN, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;New York&quot; magazine. In August 2018, Trump suggested that he might shut down the government to force Congress to fund his border wall, boasting that Hannity agreed with the action.

=== Religion ===
Hannity left the Catholic Church in 2019, citing &quot;too much institutionalized corruption&quot;. However, he has said that as he has aged, his Christian faith has &quot;gotten stronger&quot; and that he needs and wants God in his life.

Hannity has warned of Sharia law coming to the United States. Hannity opposed the building of Park51, a mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site. Hannity promoted the idea of &quot;Islamic training camps right here in America&quot;, which were based on an unsubstantiated &quot;documentary&quot; by the Christian Action Network. In 2006, Hannity was critical of Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to U.S. Congress, being sworn into office with an oath on a Quran. Hannity equated the Quran with &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, asking a guest on his show whether he would have allowed Ellison &quot;to choose, you know, Hitler&#x27;s Mein Kampf, which is the Nazi bible?&quot;

=== Torture ===
In 2009, Hannity said he supported enhanced interrogation, a euphemism for torture. He also volunteered to be waterboarded for charity. In response, Keith Olbermann pledged to donate $1,000 for every second of waterboarding Hannity underwent. In 2017, Hannity continued to advocate for waterboarding, raising the example of using it against a kidnapper. According to Media Matters, Hannity has not been waterboarded as of March 2018.

=== Climate change ===
Hannity rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2001, he described it as &quot;phony science from the left&quot;. In 2004, he falsely claimed that scientists couldn&#x27;t agree on whether global warming was &quot;scientific fact or fiction&quot;. In 2010, Hannity falsely stated that so-called &quot;Climategate&quot;the leaking of e-mails written by climate scientists that, according to climate change deniers, demonstrated scientific misconduct, but which all subsequent inquiries found to show no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoingwas a scandal that &quot;exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists&quot;. Hannity frequently invites critics of climate science onto his shows.

=== &quot;Death panels&quot; ===
Hannity promoted the falsehood that the Affordable Care Act would create so-called &quot;death panels&quot;. According to a study by Dartmouth College political scientist Brendan Nyhan, Hannity&#x27;s show, along with the &quot;Laura Ingraham Show&quot;, were the first major conservative media personalities to latch onto the false claim of Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, that the Affordable Care Act contained death panels. When Sarah Palin stirred controversy by promoting the death panels myth, and argued her case in a Facebook post, Hannity defended her and said, &quot;I agree with everything that she wrote.&quot; Hannity also claimed that he found the specific pages in the Affordable Care Act containing provisions on death panels.

A 2016 study found that Hannity promoted a number of falsehoods about the Affordable Care Act. For instance, Hannity falsely alleged several times that Democratic Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus had said Social Security could be &quot;insolvent in two years&quot; due to the Affordable Care Act. According to the study, Hannity, unlike other Fox News hosts such as Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Greta Van Susteren, &quot;took a more direct approach, aggressively supporting Republicans and conservatives and attacking Democrats and liberals, endorsing the more spurious claims long after they were proven incorrect, and putting advocacy above accurate reporting, to further the network&#x27;s themes opposing reform&quot;.

=== Foreign policy ===
In 2009, Hannity said of the Iraq War, &quot;we were victorious in spite of the Democrats&#x27; efforts and attempts at preventing victory.&quot; During the 2016 election, Hannity vouched for Trump&#x27;s claimed opposition to the Iraq War, &quot;Mr. Trump and I disagreed about the Iraq war; I was for it and he was against it.&quot;

In June 2019, Hannity called on Trump to &quot;bomb the hell of out Iran&quot; after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. After the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, Hannity opened his show by saying, &quot;tonight the world is safer as one of the most ruthless, evil war criminals on Earth has been brought to justice.&quot;

From 2015 into 2018, Fox News broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of Uranium One to Russian interests, which Hannity characterized as &quot;one of the biggest scandals in American history&quot;. The Fox News coverage extended throughout the programming day, with particular emphasis by Hannity. The network promoted a narrative asserting that, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton personally approved the Uranium One sale in exchange for $145million in bribes paid to the Clinton Foundation. Donald Trump repeated these allegations as a candidate and as president. No evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton had been found after three years of allegations, an FBI investigation, and the 2017 appointment of a Federal attorney to evaluate the investigation. In November 2017, Fox News host Shepard Smith concisely debunked the alleged scandal, including saying that Clinton did not personally approve the sale, infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for CNN or MSNBC. Hannity later called Smith &quot;clueless&quot;, while Smith stated, &quot;I get it, that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don&#x27;t work there. I wouldn&#x27;t work there.&quot;

A two-year Justice Department investigation initiated after Trump became president found no evidence to justify pursuing a criminal investigation.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
In February 2020, amid the spread of COVID-19 to the United States, Hannity said &quot;many on the left are now all rooting for corona to wreak havoc in the United States. Why? To score cheap, repulsive political points.&quot; In March 2020, he characterized the virus as a &quot;hoax&quot;, and said it &quot;may be true&quot; that the outbreak was a &quot;fraud&quot; perpetrated by the &quot;deep state&quot;. Later in March, as the disease spread into a global pandemic and Trump declared it a national emergency, Hannity started to take the virus more seriously, denying that he had referred to it as a hoax less than a month earlier. In July 2021, on live television, Hannity encouraged the audience to consider vaccination.

===Biden family investigation===
Hannity was a major promoter of allegations that President Joe Biden had acted corruptly through involvement in the business affairs of his son Hunter Biden, characterizing the men as leaders of the &quot;Biden crime family.&quot; CNN characterized &quot;Hannity&quot; as &quot;the primary vehicle for driving the narrative to the GOP base.&quot; Hannity alleged the president had been &quot;very credibly accused of public corruption on a scale this country has never seen before,&quot; including taking a bribe from a Ukrainian businessman, as alleged by a &quot;highly credible&quot; FBI informant. Analysis by Media Matters found that Hannity had discussed the bribery allegation on his program 85 times in 2023, and had hosted James Comer, chair of the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family 43 times to discuss the investigation that year. &quot;Hannity&quot; ran at least 115 segments in 2023 falsely alleging that as vice president Joe Biden had corruptly pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to protect Hunter Biden and his employer, Burisma, from an investigation.

Comer began investigating the Bidens in January 2023 but did not find evidence of wrongdoing by the president; nevertheless, Republicans who controlled the House voted unanimously to initiate an impeachment inquiry in December 2023. The FBI informant who made the bribery allegation was indicted in February 2024 on charges he had fabricated the story; the indictment alleged the informant, Alexander Smirnov, was associated with Russian intelligence. Hannity did not mention the development on his program that night, and Media Matters reported that by April 2024 he had not mentioned the Biden inquiry or hosted Comer for a month. Lacking evidence and Republican appetite to proceed to impeachment hearings with their thin House majority, by March 2024 the impeachment inquiry was winding down.

== Personal life ==
Hannity met Jill Rhodes in 1991 when he worked at WVNN in Huntsville, Alabama and she was a political columnist for the &quot;Huntsville Times&quot;. The two married in 1993. In June 2020, the couple announced that they had divorced the previous year but had separated years prior.

Hannity has since dated Fox News colleague Ainsley Earhardt. In August 2019, Hannity and Earhardt arrived together as guests for a wedding at Trump National Golf Course in Colts Neck, New Jersey. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she hosted her &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; program from a remote studio in the basement of Hannity&#x27;s Long Island mansion. It was announced that Hannity proposed to Earhardt on Christmas Day 2024 at a church in Florida.

Hannity has two children from his marriage to Rhodes: a son, Patrick, born in 1998, and daughter, Merri, born in 2001. Both children graduated from Cold Spring Harbor High School. Patrick attended Wake Forest University where he played tennis. Merri attends The University of Michigan where she also plays tennis. In high school, Merri was the fourth highest ranked tennis player in New York State.

In 2014, he said he has carried a weapon &quot;more than half my adult life&quot;. According to Hannity, he has a brown belt in martial arts and trains four days a week in the sport.

In 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Hannity&#x27;s annual income was $36million. In April 2021, he purchased a $5.3 million house several miles from Donald Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago residence.

In 2024, Hannity announced that he had moved from his home in Long Island, New York to Florida and would be broadcasting &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; and &quot;Hannity&quot; from his new home permanently.

<text>The San Diego Zoo is a zoo in San Diego, California, located in Balboa Park. It began with a collection of animals left over from the 1915 Panama–California Exposition that were brought together by its founder, Dr. Harry M. Wegeforth. The zoo was a pioneer in the concept of open-air, cage-less exhibits that recreate natural animal habitats.

The zoo sits on 100 acres (40 ha) of land leased from the City of San Diego. It houses over 12,000 animals of more than 680 species and subspecies. It is the most visited zoo in the United States; travelers have cited it as one of the best zoos in the world.

Its parent organization, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, is a private nonprofit conservation organization and has one of the largest zoological membership associations in the world. The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance also operates the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

==History==

The San Diego Zoo grew out of exotic animal exhibitions abandoned after the 1915 Panama–California Exposition. Dr. Harry M. Wegeforth founded the Zoological Society of San Diego, meeting October 2, 1916, which initially followed precedents set by the New York Zoological Society at the Bronx Zoo. He served as president of the society until 1941.

A permanent tract of land in Balboa Park was set aside in August 1921; on the advice of the city attorney, it was agreed that the city would own all the animals and the zoo would manage them. The zoo began to move in the following year. In addition to the animals from the exposition, the zoo acquired a menagerie from the defunct Wonderland Amusement Park. Ellen Browning Scripps financed a fence around the zoo so that it could begin charging an entrance fee to offset costs. The publication &quot;ZooNooz&quot; commenced in early 1925.

Animal collector Frank Buck went to work as director of the San Diego Zoo on June 13, 1923, signed to a three-year contract by Wegeforth. William T. Hornaday, director of the Bronx Zoo, had recommended Buck for the job, but Buck quickly clashed with the strong-willed Wegeforth and left the zoo after three months to return to animal collecting.

After several other equally short-lived zoo directors, Wegeforth appointed the zoo&#x27;s bookkeeper, Belle Benchley, to the position of executive secretary, in effect zoo director; she was given the actual title of zoo director a few years later. She served as zoo director from 1925 until 1953. For most of that time she was the only female zoo director in the world. She was succeeded as director by Dr. Charles Schroeder.

In October of 1938, it was widely reported across the country that the (then) &quot;Zoological Society of San Diego&quot;, under the direction of Belle Benchley, arranged to have two three-year old giraffes, later named Patches and Lofty, transported from East Africa via freighter, where during their 54 days at sea they were caught in the Hurricane of 1938. They were then kept for 16 days at the U.S. Animal Quarantine Station in Athenia, New Jersey and driven over 14 days cross-country via the nascent Lee Highway on a specially customized truck to the zoo. The quarantine station, the giraffes, the zoo and Benchley featured prominently in the 2019 novel, &quot;West With Giraffes.&quot;

The San Diego Zoo was a pioneer in building &quot;cageless&quot; exhibits. Wegeforth was determined to create moated exhibits from the start, and the first lion area at the San Diego Zoo without enclosing wires opened in 1922.

Until the 1960s, admission for children under 16 was free, regardless of whether they were accompanied by a paying adult.
The zoo&#x27;s Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species (CRES) was founded in 1975 at the urging of Kurt Benirschke, who became its first director. In 2005, CRES was renamed the Division of Conservation and Research for Endangered Species under newly appointed director Allison Alberts to better reflect its mission. In 2009, CRES was significantly expanded to become the Institute for Conservation Research.

The world&#x27;s only albino koala in a zoological facility was born September 1, 1997, at the San Diego Zoo and was named Onya-Birri, which means &quot;ghost boy&quot; in an Australian Aboriginal language. The San Diego Zoo has the largest number of koalas outside of Australia.

In 2014, a colony of African penguins arrived for the first time in the zoo since 1979. They have since moved into Africa Rocks when it opened in 2017.

In 2016, Baba, the last pangolin on display in North America at the time, died at the zoo.

In October 2020, two gorillas charged at the glass of their enclosure, damaging the outer pane.

===Escapes===

The San Diego Zoo has had several notable escapees through the years; the most noteworthy of them is Ken Allen, a Bornean orangutan who came to be known as &quot;the hairy Houdini&quot;, for his many escapes.

In 1940, a Malayan Tapir managed to escape several times, earning it the nickname &quot;Terrible Trudy&quot;.

In 1977, an animal control officer for the County of San Diego, Tom Van Wagner, a previous employee of the San Diego Zoo as a tour bus guide, captured a Tasmanian devil escapee in a south-central San Diego home&#x27;s garage. The animal was transported to the zoo and the zoo hospital staff took possession of the capture.

In March 2013, the zoo, which was hosting a private party at the time, had to initiate a lockdown when two striped hyenas somehow got past their barriers. They were &quot;darted with a sedative and taken to the veterinary care clinic.&quot;

In 2014, a koala named Mundu escaped to a neighboring tree just outside its Koalafornia Australia Outback enclosure. Zookeepers lured him down the tree once the park closed that day.

In early 2015, two Wolf&#x27;s guenons monkeyed around outside of their Lost Forest enclosure after escaping. One of the monkeys neared a fence line off of Route 163, but was brought back to safety without injury.

Adira is a 2-year-old female red panda, who also happens to be an escape artist. Over in Panda Canyon, Adira scaled a tree in her enclosure and escaped for 6 hrs on January 29, 2023. Luckily, Adira stayed close to home and was easily led back into her enclosure. A zoo social media account speculated, &quot;January is the start of the panda&#x27;s breeding season, which one could speculate may have been the reason for the jailbreak.&quot; The San Diego Zoo is currently breeding the red pandas because of their status being labeled endangered on the IUCN Red List; there are thought to be less than 10,000 left in the world. Adira and Lucas said hello to their first little cub on June 9, 2023, the first baby red panda since 2006 for the San Diego Zoo. The hope for saving red pandas has also sparked lots of attention from the people because of the new movie Turning Red, which highlights red pandas as its main character and theme.

==Features==

The zoo offers a guided tour bus that traverses 75% of the park. There is also an overhead gondola lift called the Skyfari, providing an aerial view of the zoo. The Skyfari was built in 1969 by the Von Roll tramway company of Bern, Switzerland. The San Diego Zoo Skyfari is a Von Roll type 101.

Exhibits at the zoo are often designed around a particular habitat. The same exhibit may feature many different animals that can be found side by side in the wild, along with native plant life. Exhibits range from an African rain forest (featuring gorillas) to the Arctic taiga and tundra in the summertime (featuring polar bears). Some of the largest free-flight aviaries in existence are here, including the Owens Aviary and the Scripps Aviary. Many exhibits are &quot;natural&quot;, with invisible wires and darkened blinds (to view birds), and accessible pools and open-air moats (for large mammals).

The San Diego Zoo also operates the San Diego Zoo Safari Park (formerly the San Diego Wild Animal Park), a nearly 2000-acre park located 30 miles northeast of the Zoo near Escondido, which features animals in more expansive, open areas than the zoo&#x27;s urban 100 acres can provide. Exhibits are themed mainly around Asia, Africa, and Australia, with the five largest being 100- to 200-acre &quot;savannas&quot;; these mixed-species field exhibits feature grassy rolling hills, canyons, lakes, and rocky outcrops to give the animals a more naturalistic, enriching home. This approach has brought the Safari Park much-breeding success, and (in an effort to maintain fresh bloodlines) animals are regularly relocated between the two locations. The San Diego facilities also actively exchange animals with other zoos around the world, in accordance with Species Survival Plan (SSP) recommendations.
San Diego has one of the world&#x27;s largest and most diverse animal collections; however, the total number of animal species in the collection has been reduced somewhat over the past two decades (2000–2020), from around 860 to approximately 650. This comes as exhibits are redeveloped into more spacious, naturalistic areas, and as several animals are transitioned to the Safari Park.

The temperate, sunny maritime climate of California is well suited to many plants and animals. The zoo is also an accredited botanical garden; the botanical collection includes more than 700,000 exotic plants. As part of its gardening effort, some rare animal foods are grown at the zoo. For example, 40 varieties of bamboo were raised for the pandas when they were at the zoo on long-term loan from China. It also maintains 18 varieties of eucalyptus trees to feed its koalas.

Keepers and most other employees at the San Diego Zoo are members of Teamsters Union Local 481.

==Exhibits==

===Monkey Trail and Forest Tales===

Monkey Trails showcases primates and other animals native to the tropical rainforests of Asia and Africa. Opening in 2005, it replaced a decades-old area of exhibits known as Ape and Bird Mesa. These were some of the oldest animal &quot;houses&quot; still in use (at the time) at the San Diego Zoo, being built in the 1930s, with little to no change until the demolition of Monkey Trails. In addition to a few small bird aviaries and a troop of siamang apes living on a treehouse in the center of a pond, the site was centered around two square buildings; these plain structures contained many small exhibits lined up, one after another, on all four sides. One of the buildings was focused on monkeys, while the other was mainly songbirds, parrots, and tropical avian species. There had been a few efforts at landscaping these cages; however, the monkeys notably lived in bleak, &quot;prison-cell&quot; like cages. Several Zoo members and guests left comments over the years regarding the exhibits and their lack of plant life, the (apparent) lack of enrichment for the monkeys, and, mostly, the appearance of cement &quot;cell blocks&quot; as exhibits.

Monkey Trails is home primarily to monkeys such as the Angola colobus, tufted capuchin, De Brazza&#x27;s monkey, lesser spot-nosed monkey, Black mangabey, Wolf&#x27;s mona monkey, and mandrill. There is also a pair of pygmy hippopotamus named Elgon and Mabel, who share their underwater-viewing pond with a large school of African cichlids and tilapia. On April 9, 2020, Mabel gave birth to Akobi, a male calf. His birth marked the first pygmy hippo born at the zoo in nearly thirty years.

Throughout the walking paths, visitors can also see West African slender-snouted crocodiles, different reptiles, and various African freshwater fish; these different animals live in a series of densely-planted paludarium- and riparium-style exhibits, complete with thick glass panels for close-up animal encounters. Monkey Trails utilized a newer concept for the displaying of arboreal animals; by making the exhibits two storeys high, with stairs, walkways, and elevators for access, the habits of animals can be observed from ground level as well as from the treetops. Some of the horticultural highlights of Monkey Trails include several massive Banyan fig (Ficus) trees (viewable in public areas as well as in animal exhibits), cycads, and a bog garden with Sarracenia, Drosera, Venus flytraps and other carnivorous plants.

===Owens Aviary===

The Owens Aviary contains about 200 individual tropical birds from around 45 species, mainly from Australasia, Oceania, and Papua New Guinea. The aviary is built onto the side of an approx. 60&#x27; high canyon wall, being accessible via an entry/exit at the uppermost level and another at the lower end of the aviary (essentially the canyon floor). The walkway inside the aviary connects these entryways as it ascends and descends with the natural slope. The naturally steep location proves to be perfect for the exhibit&#x27;s waterfall, which cascades downhill through the aviary before splashing down into a large pond. The ambient white noise of the waterfall is quite noticeable, but relaxing and tranquil, rather than very loud. The waterfall churns up mist, and cool steam fills the aviary with ambient humidity; additionally, the outside of the structure is painted a dark green color, which helps to block any excess sunlight from penetrating inside. This further gives visitors the feeling of walking through a lush, dense jungle.

The entire aviary is lushly landscaped and thick with palms, ficus, &quot;Araceae&quot; species (such as &quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot; and &quot;Thaumatophyllum&quot;), &quot;Clivia&quot; sp., ferns and many more varieties. The varied collection of bird life includes the Chinese hwamei, eclectus parrot, black-naped fruit doves, common emerald doves, red-billed leiothrix, Victoria crowned pigeons, Bali mynas, Nicobar pigeons, the blue-crowned laughingthrush, white-rumped shamas, the maleo, Himalayan monal, Indian peafowl, and great argus pheasants.

===Scripps Aviary===
The Scripps Aviary was built in 1923 and is home to many colorful birds from Africa such as the violet-backed starling, African gray parrots, blue-bellied rollers, tambourine doves, great blue turacos, hamerkops, superb starlings, black-headed weavers, white-headed buffalo weavers, white-faced whistling ducks, African spoonbills, Madagascar crested ibises and southern bald ibises.

===Parker Aviary===
The Parker Aviary houses various birds from South America including Andean cock-of-the-rocks, blue-crowned motmots, blue-headed macaws, crested oropendola, Inca terns, keel-billed toucans, ringed teals, sunbitterns and toco toucans as well as golden lion tamarins. It is situated next to a complex of 20 smaller aviaries previously known as Wings of Australasia, exhibiting tropical birds from Southeast Asia and the Pacific. San Diego Zoo has the largest collection of birds in North America. Together the zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park hold America&#x27;s most diverse collection of hornbills, with 15 species displayed in 2014.

===Asian Passage===
The San Diego Zoo had been one of four zoos in the U.S. that had giant pandas on display and had been the most successful in terms of panda reproduction. The first two giant panda cubs in U.S. history to have been born in the U.S. and survive into adulthood—Hua Mei (female, born to Bai Yun and Shi Shi) and Mei Sheng (male, born to Bai Yun and Gao Gao)—were born at the zoo, in 1999 and 2003, respectively. After that, three more giant panda cubs—Su Lin and Zhen Zhen (both females) and Yun Zi (male)—were born to the resident giant panda parents Bai Yun and Gao Gao. Xiao Liwu (meaning &quot;little gift&quot;), was born on July 29, 2012, and was let outside for visitors to see on January 9, 2013. By 2015, all of the cubs had been sent back to China to participate in the breeding program there.

By April 2019, the giant panda exhibit had closed. The pandas in the enclosure had been repatriated to China after successfully serving its conservation mission. Since the closing of Panda Trek, the exhibit had been repurposed to display other Chinese animals, including golden takins, red pandas, Mang Mountain pit vipers, Amur leopards, snow leopards and an exhibit comparing several types of bamboo.

In November 1984, the Chinese Wildlife Protection Association, the Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction and Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Forestry, and the Chengdu Zoo formed a Chinese delegation to the United States to carry a pair of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys to the San Diego Zoo for a 13-day exhibition of snub-nosed monkeys. This was the first time that golden snub-nosed monkeys were exhibited abroad.

In November 2023, China&#x27;s President Xi Jinping hinted at the return of giant pandas to the zoo as a &quot;gesture that China is ready to continue cooperation with the U.S. on panda conservation.&quot; In June 2024, a pair of pandas, named Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, were loaned to the zoo. The two giant pandas made their debut at the San Diego Zoo on August 8, 2024.

===Urban Jungle===

The Urban Jungle houses different animals including a small herd of Masai giraffes, Soemmerring&#x27;s gazelles, American flamingos, a Grant&#x27;s zebra, a miniature donkey and Indian rhinoceroses. Many of the Zoo&#x27;s animal ambassadors live there including a binturong, southern ground hornbills,red kangaroos, fennec foxes, South African cheetahs and Cape porcupines.

===Polar Bear Plunge===
Polar Bear Plunge, which opened in 1996, and was renovated in March 2010, houses over 30 species representing the Arctic. The main animals in the area are the three polar bears, named Kalluk, Chinook, and Tatqiq. More animals that make their home in the Plunge include reindeer, arctic foxes, racoons, eurasian lynx and an underwater viewing area is available to observe the polar bears swimming in their pool.

Farther down the path lies an aviary with several species of diving ducks. Some of the horticultural highlights include giant redwood trees, many different pine trees, and manzanita.

Just up the path of Polar Bear Plunge is Northwest Passage, housing mountain lions, maned wolves, giant anteaters, Patagonian maras, gerenuk, bontebok, tufted deer, Grévy&#x27;s zebras, musk deer, Cuvier&#x27;s gazelle, lesser kudu, Speke&#x27;s gazelles, Chacoan Peccarys, as well as the Eagle Canyon, home to Andean condors, harpy eagles, ornate hawk eagles and Steller&#x27;s sea eagles.

===Wildlife Explorers Basecamp===
Opened in 2022, the Wildlife Explorers Basecamp was built on the site of the historic Children&#x27;s Zoo, allowing children to get closer to several animals and also includes interactive play opportunities and sculptures. There are 4 main zones in the basecamp that feature wildlife that lives in the 4 main ecosystems: Desert Dunes, Wild Woods, Marsh Meadows, and The Rainforest.

The Rainforest includes Naked Mole Rats, Goats, binturong, Burmese star tortoises, sloths, caracals, ocelots, wombats, Brazilian porcupines and southern tamanduas. Desert Dunes includes black-tailed prairie dogs, burrowing owls, and fennec foxes. Wild Woods includes squirrel monkeys and coatis.

====Hummingbird Habitat====

A small aviary that, as of July 2022, includes three species of hummingbirds, the Anna&#x27;s, Costa&#x27;s, and Amazilia hummingbirds, along with other birds from South America such as bananaquits, crested quail-doves, golden-collared manakins, blue-necked tanagers, green-backed trogons, opal-rumped tanagers, paradise tanagers, swallow tanagers, turquoise tanagers, screaming pihas, violaceous euphonias, green honeycreepers, purple honeycreepers, red pileated finches, spangled cotingas and pompadour cotingas. Guests can view the birds from an observation bridge, and the aviary also includes a cenote pool. Wattled jacanas can also be seen in the aviary.

====Spineless Marvels====
The McKinney Spineless Marvels features naked mole-rats and a large invertebrate collection consisting of Central American giant cave cockroaches, Madagascar hissing cockroaches, leafcutter ants, Goliath beetles, giant dead leaf mantises, ghost mantises, two-spotted assassin bugs, giant African millipedes, giant desert hairy scorpions, golden silk orb-weavers, Antilles pinktoe tarantulas, Brazilian black tarantulas, Mexican fireleg tarantulas, golden-eyed stick insects, goliath stick insects, jungle nymphs, thorny devil stick insects and western honey bees.

====Cool Critters====

Some of the species housed here are axolotl, Chinese giant salamanders, Cuvier&#x27;s dwarf caimans, Fiji banded iguana, leopard geckos, Indonesian blue-tongued skinks, common chuckwallas, yellow-spotted river turtles, freshwater angelfish, giant danios, pinktail chalceus, threadfin acara, multiple Lake Malawi cichlids, South American lungfish and sunburst diving beetles.

====Reptile Walk====

Previously called Reptile Mesa, the Reptile Walk houses small outdoor yards, one housing European species like European pond turtles, marginated tortoises, scheltopusiks and ocellated lizards while the other contains African species, radiated tortoises, Sudan plated lizards and yellow-throated plated lizards. Nearby is the Komodo Kingdom, a new exhibit for the zoo&#x27;s Komodo dragons.

Walking down the path leads to a building split in two. One side contains terrariums for amphibians such as the Amazon milk frog, Panamanian golden frog, brown mantella, magnificent tree frog, fire salamander, Kaiser&#x27;s mountain newt and many species of poison dart frog including the dyeing poison dart frog, green and black poison dart frog, black-legged poison frog and splashback poison frog. The other side contains native Californian species like the Colorado River toad, California kingsnake, coastal rosy boa, Baja California rat snake, San Diego gopher snake and giant horned lizard.

The walkway then passes an enclosure for the endangered Chinese alligator and afterwards is a building housing turtles, including broad-shelled river turtles, Roti Island snake-necked turtles, Argentine snake-necked turtles, red-headed Amazon River turtles, Malayan snail-eating turtles, Parker&#x27;s snake-necked turtles, mata mata and pig-nosed turtles.

Nearby is the gharial pond. Various turtles like Indian flapshell turtles, Indian narrow-headed softshell turtles, northern river terrapins, painted terrapins and others are also housed with the gharials.

Concluding the Reptile Walk are yards housing Asian forest tortoises, African spurred tortoises, blue iguanas, Jamaican iguanas, Galápagos tortoises and leopard tortoises.

===Lost Forest===

Based upon the real Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the central part of the continent of Africa, this exhibit opened in 1999 as &#x27;Ituri Forest&#x27; and houses different animal species from the rainforests of central Africa. The exhibit begins with a forested exhibit for okapi, black duiker, and forest buffalo, then winds past a recreation of two-leaf-covered Mbuti huts with signage about the people&#x27;s customs and traditions. Next, the path leads to the hippopotamus exhibit housing three hippopotamus named Funani and her daughter Amahle, and Guadalupe, and has an underwater viewing area.

After the hippos, the path passes through a bunch of bamboo before reaching a clearing where the aviaries are located A thatched-roof gift shop and a food stand are located in a plaza near by. Immediately to the right is an exhibit with red river hogs, Allen&#x27;s swamp monkeys, Red-tailed monkeys, and spotted-necked otters. The plaza leads to a bridge flanked by the red river hog exhibit on one side and an exhibit that only the monkeys and otters can access on the other. Across the bridge is a creek where the otters can swim, with viewing both above and below the water&#x27;s surface. Afterwards, the path joins the rest of the zoo.

===Elephant Odyssey===

This exhibit opened on May 23, 2009, on the site of the former Hoof and Horn Mesa area, and was met with mixed reviews. The main feature of the exhibit is the elephant habitat—more than three times the size of the zoo&#x27;s former elephant exhibit Elephant Mesa (now the &quot;Urban Jungle&quot; exhibit area). Currently a herd of five, the herd includes three females and two twin brothers. It consists of a blended herd of three African bush elephants named Shaba, two new juveniles from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park and Reid Park Zoo named Tsandizkle and Inhlonipho, and two Asian elephants named Devi and Mary. Elephant Odyssey also features a glimpse of the past, with the Fossil Portal and life-size statues of ancient creatures of Southern California next to exhibits of their modern-day counterparts. The ancient life represented include the Columbian mammoth, the saber-toothed cat, the American lion, the Daggett&#x27;s eagle, a Merriam&#x27;s teratorn, the dwarf pronghorn, the dire wolf, the short-faced bear and the Jefferson&#x27;s ground sloth.
The Fossil Portal is an artificial tar pit that periodically drains to reveal man-made Pleistocene-era bones. The path turns a corner and opens up at the Mammoth Passage Plaza, with exhibits for jaguars and African lions, with a lion named Ernest and a lioness named Miss Ellen, as well as an exhibit that has houses Linnaeus&#x27;s two-toed sloths to the right, and the tip of the elephant exhibit, with a large wading pool, straight ahead. The path continues to the left along with the pool, passing by the jaguar exhibit on the left. The northern end of the elephant pool drains into the mixed-species exhibit, which houses Baird&#x27;s tapirs, guanacos, and capybaras. The path meets up with the elephant exhibit again before it reaches the Elephant Care Center, where visitors can watch keepers care for the pachyderms.

Next is an exhibit for secretary birds with grasses, a tree, and a statue of the extinct Daggett&#x27;s eagle nearby. Afterward, the path goes down a crevasse with a wall embedded with vivaria for dung beetles. The path tunnels below the elephant exhibit to reach the other side, where it continues between the elephant exhibit and a creek for native reptiles and amphibians. Just past the source of the stream is a restaurant and gift shop, and after that are exhibits for dromedary camels, llamas, horses, &amp; burros and another with pronghorns. Next the path splits between a playground, a rattlesnake terrarium, and a California condor aviary with artificial rock spires and a stream. The paths then reunite and join the rest of the zoo.

===Gorilla Tropics===

Simulating the rainforests of central Africa, and opened in 1991, Gorilla Tropics has an enclosure for the eponymous species. The exhibit has waterfalls, a meadow, and tropical plants such as allspice, coral trees, and African tulip trees, as well as several species of bamboo.

Guests can view the six western lowland gorillas, which are a pair consisting of Paul Donn and Jessica as well as a bachelor troop consisting of four males named Ekuba, Maka, Mandazzi and Denny from a viewing window, across a waterfall, and across a creek. Nearby are the bonobo habitat, an enclosure for an aviary housing crowned eagles and a small glass aviary by the bonobos housing a variety of smaller birds like exclamatory paradise whydahs, purple grenadiers, red-billed firefinches, red-cheeked cordon-bleus, zebra waxbills and more. There is also a row of other mesh aviaries which include more birds like three species of bird-of-paradise, the raggiana bird-of-paradise, magnificent bird-of-paradise, superb bird-of-paradise alongside others like Bali mynas, crested wood partridges, red-tailed black cockatoos, tricolored parrotfinch, mountain peacock-pheasants, western crowned pigeons, beautiful fruit doves, Guam kingfishers, Mindanao bleeding-hearts and blue-crowned lorikeets.

===Absolutely Apes===

This exhibit opened in 2003, as a major renovation of the former &quot;Whittier Southeast Asian Exhibits&quot;, which had opened in 1982. It houses three female Sumatran orangutans, Karen, Indah, and Aisha, as well as one juvenile sumatran male, Kaja. The orangutans live alongside two siamangs Eloise and her daughter Selamat in an exhibit, which is flanked by a glass viewing window.

The exhibit provides sway poles and artificial trees for the apes to swing on and a fake termite mound for them to fish condiments out of. The viewing area is designed to resemble the mulch-lined exhibit side of the viewing window by having rubber mulch, and miniature sway poles for kids. Some plant species in the exhibit are toog trees, carrotwood trees, and markhamia trees. Silvery lutungs reside in an exhibit adjacent to this area.

===Sun Bear Forest===
This $3.5 million exhibit opened in 1989, and exhibits Bornean sun bears, François&#x27; langurs, White-cheeked gibbons, and Aye-ayes. One end of the complex houses lion-tailed macaques in a grassy exhibit with a stream and climbing ropes. The oblong sun bear exhibit straddles the path along the rest of the complex, and an aviary houses some species of birds, including Asian fairy-bluebird and Red-billed leiothrix. Farther down the path, visitors can see grizzly bears, sloth bears, spotted hyenas, spectacled bears and river otters.

===Tiger Trail===

Tiger Trail, located in a sloping canyon, opened in 1988 and houses three Malayan tiger brothers named Conner, the eldest, and twins, Cinta and Berani. From the top of the canyon, It proceeds to another pavilion, this time flanked by a bunch of aviaries which feature Asian fairy-bluebirds, Baikal teals, blue-crowned laughingthrushes, Edwards&#x27;s pheasants, common emerald doves, tricolored parrotfinch, red-billed leiothrix, and there are also exhibits for fishing cats and rare coconut crabs.

Farther down the canyon is an exhibit for Malayan tapirs, North Sulawesi babirusas, Indian pythons and the tiger habitat, which has a hillside stream, waterfall, and glass viewing window. The Tiger Trail area of the zoo, when dedicated in 1988 as &#x27;Tiger River&#x27;, replaced an exhibit area that was known as Cascade Canyon, which had opened in 1973.

===Outback===

A new Australian Outback area, nicknamed &quot;Koalafornia&quot;, opened in May 2013. The San Diego Zoo has the largest koala colony outside of Australia and the largest collection of Australian wildlife in America. It has twice as much exhibit space for koalas, including more outdoor enclosures based on a realization that koalas need sun exposure for their health.

The new area includes other Australian marsupials, such as parma wallabies, brush tailed bettongs, Goodfellow&#x27;s tree-kangaroos, common ringtail possums, &amp; short-beaked echidnas, though they are monotremes as well as Australasian birds, such as kagus, laughing kookaburras, blue-faced honeyeaters, common emerald doves, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, metallic starlings, masked lapwings, Gouldian finches and palm cockatoos. Since October 2013, the exhibit also houses Tasmanian devils, the first American zoo to do so; the animals are now kept in half a dozen zoos in the Americas as part of the Australian government&#x27;s Save the Tasmanian Devil Program.

===Africa Rocks===

Conrad Prebys&#x27;s Africa Rocks highlights the biodiversity of Africa. The exhibit opened on July 1, 2017, but was not completed until December 6, 2017. The exhibit cost US$60 million to construct. The money was donated to the zoo by 3,800 donors. Africa Rocks replaced Dog and Cat Canyon, which featured grottos that were built in the 1930s.

The exhibit features the following six habitats:

====Cape Fynbos====

The Cape Fynbos exhibit features African penguins, an endangered species native to South Africa. The exhibit was designed to mimic the giant granite boulders that are found on Boulders Beach in South Africa, a place where these birds live. The long and wide habitat also includes a pool for the penguins that stretches , with depths up to . Along with the large pool, the exhibit features a cobblestone beach and a nesting area. A group of 20 penguins moved in on June 22, 2017, to get ready for when the exhibit opened on July 1, 2017.

The penguins also share their exhibit with leopard sharks among other fish. Twelve leopard sharks arrived on June 23, 2017, from SeaWorld San Diego. The sharks were introduced to their exhibit and their penguin neighbors on Wednesday, June 28, 2017. The sharks range in age from 5 to 20. African penguins do not live alongside leopard sharks in the wild; however, they do live with similar shark species. Leopard sharks feed on crustaceans on the bottom floor and do not pose a threat to the penguins.

====Acacia Woodland====

The Acacia Woodland exhibit features a leopard exhibit, a troop of vervet monkeys, and an aviary. The leopard exhibit does not feature the African subspecies of leopard, but rather exhibits Amur leopards, from as far as Russia to Northern China. This is because the Amur leopard is critically endangered, as there are only around 60 individuals left in the wild. The San Diego Zoo participates in the Amur leopard Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that focuses on preserving the genetics of this endangered cat. The Acacia Woodland exhibit will allow the Zoo to have more breeding spaces for the cats. The Zoo has a spotted and a black leopard.

The aviary in this exhibit features two species of bee-eaters, the white-fronted and white-throated, as well as white-headed buffalo weavers and several other bird species. The exhibit also features African silverbills, African pygmy geese, violet-backed starlings, splendid sunbirds, blue-naped mousebirds, common waxbills, emerald-spotted wood doves, golden-breasted starlings, exclamatory paradise whydahs, magpie mannikins, Namaqua doves, pin-tailed whydahs, purple grenadiers, red-billed firefinches, red-cheeked cordon-bleus, snowy-crowned robin-chats, village indigobirds, white-bellied go-away-birds, white-headed buffalo weavers, yellow-crowned bishops, yellow-mantled widowbirds, and zebra waxbills. There are also Mozambique girdled lizards in the aviary.

====Madagascar Forest====

The Madagascar Forest exhibit features lemur species that the Association of Zoos and Aquariums&#x27; (AZA) Prosimian Taxon Advisory Group (TAG) has identified as needing sustainability assistance for the North American population, including blue-eyed black, red ruffed, red-collared, ring-tailed lemurs and Coquerel&#x27;s sifakas.

Along with lemurs, the Madagascar Forest exhibit houses the lemurs&#x27; main predator the fossa as well as honey badgers.

====Ethiopian Highlands====

The Ethiopian Highlands exhibit houses two primate species: the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. The San Diego Zoo is only the second zoo in North America to house geladas, the other facility being the Bronx Zoo. An all-male troop of geladas arrived on September 7, 2016, from the Wilhelma Zoo in Stuttgart, Germany. This move was based on the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums&#x27; (EAZA) European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for geladas—the European equivalent of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums&#x27; (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) program. The bachelor group will be introduced to females later on. The exhibit is also home to Nubian ibexes.

====Kopje====

The word kopje in Dutch means &quot;small head&quot; which describes the rock formations that seem to pop out in the savanna. Kopjes are homes for well-adapted animals. The San Diego Zoo&#x27;s Kopje section in Africa Rocks is home to animals including klipspringers, rock hyraxes, and dwarf mongoosees. Each animal has well-adapted feet that allow them to cling to the rocks. The exhibit also includes Trumpeter hornbills and bateleur eagles, as well as meerkats, servals, and the red-leaved rock fig, a tree species that manages to grow wherever its seeds disperse including the rocky kopje.

====West African Forest====

The West African Forest exhibits the West African dwarf crocodile, Kenyi cichlids, the Madagascan big-headed turtle, and the West African mud turtle. Behind the crocodile exhibit features Rady Falls, a tall waterfall, the largest man-made waterfall in San Diego.

==Conservation==

The zoo is active in conservation and species-preservation efforts. Its Institute for Conservation Research (formerly the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species) raises California condors, tigers, black rhinos, polar bears, orangutans, peninsular pronghorn, desert tortoises, African penguins, mountain yellow-legged frogs, Pacific pocket mice, dholes, Francois&#x27; langurs, giraffes, quino checkerspot butterflies, Hawaiian crows, light-footed clapper rails, Gray&#x27;s monitors, tree lobsters, clouded leopards, Galapagos tortoises, Tahiti lorikeets, lion-tailed macaques, mhorr gazelles, gorillas, Przewalski&#x27;s horses, koalas, burrowing owls, elephants, African wild dogs, ocelots, Tasmanian devils, okapi, Southwestern pond turtles, Pallas&#x27;s cats, and 145 other endangered species.

The zoo has helped increase populations of endangered animals worldwide, both in captivity and in the wild. A prime example of this can be seen through the success of the repopulation of the California Condor. In 1982, due to poaching, lead poisoning, and destruction of habitat, there were only a remainder of 22 California Condors. The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance was granted permission to begin the management of the first propagation program for the California Condor. In recognition of this program, within 20 years the population of the vulnerable bird went from 22 to 200. The success of the California condor program shows the importance of breeding efforts in saving endangered animals. By carefully managing the condors’ population, the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance helped bring back the species from the brink of extinction. However, this isn’t the only species the Zoo has helped with repopulation

As a result, they have reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and have conserved habitat at 50 field sites. They also have over 200 conservation scientists working in 35 countries around the world. It employs numerous professional geneticists, cytologists, and veterinarians and maintains a cryopreservation facility for rare sperm and eggs called the frozen zoo.

The San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research is the largest zoo-based multidisciplinary research effort in the world. Based at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for Conservation Research adjacent to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, more than 200 dedicated scientists carry out research vital to the conservation of animals, plants, and habitats, locally and internationally.

==Zoo Corps==
Zoo Corps is a volunteer program at the San Diego Zoo that enlists high school students to teach guests at the zoo about the animals they are seeing and their place in the ecosystem. It enrolls students between 13 and 17 years of age. The goals are to promote public education about animals and conservation, and to help the students develop their ability to speak in public. The program runs year-round in two sessions, one from May through November and one from January through May. Members of the Zoo Corps are expected to volunteer at least once a month.

The program uses a series of &quot;Kits&quot;, which are set on tables throughout the zoo. The kits contain objects that can be used to explain why an animal is endangered or to shed light on the animal&#x27;s lifestyle. The four kits are &quot;Backyard Habitats&quot;, &quot;Saving Species&quot;, &quot;Animal Care&quot;, and &quot;Sustainability&quot;.

==Architecture==
Local architect Louis John Gill designed the original buildings, cages, and animal grottos and later in 1926, the Spanish Revival-style research hospital, for which Gill received an Honor Award from the San Diego Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Gill also designed a bird cage at the zoo in 1937, then the largest bird cage in the world.

== Awards ==
The San Diego Zoo has received numerous awards for its exhibits, programs, and reproduction and conservation efforts. This list includes only awards given to the Zoo specifically, not to its parent organization; for those, see: San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance Awards.
