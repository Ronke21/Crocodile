<text>Pollok Football Club is a Scottish football club based in Newlands in the southside of the city of Glasgow. Founded in 1908, the club spent over a century in the junior ranks but now competes in the West of Scotland Football League in tier six of the Scottish football pyramid. It is one of the biggest football clubs operating in Scottish non-league football, regularly attracting crowds of around 700, and drawing over 1000 for big matches. Pollok play at Newlandsfield Park and wear black and white stripes. Their traditional rivals are Arthurlie of Barrhead.

==History==

===Early years (1908–1967)===
Formed in 1908 as an offshoot of Poloc Cricket Club and based at a ground called Haggs Park within Pollok Estate until 1926. In the first half century of their existence, Pollok were one of many average clubs in Junior football in Glasgow, with their success limited to minor cups such as the North Eastern Cup, Kirkwood Shield and Glasgow Consolation Cup. The club moved to their current home at Newlandsfield Park in 1928, but major success remained elusive.

Pollok began to make their mark in major tournaments during the Second World War, lifting a Central League Cup and Glasgow Challenge Cup double in 1942. Their standout season in those early years was 1944–45, as they reached the Scottish Junior Cup semi-final, where they fell to Burnbank Athletic at Shawfield in front of 25,000 fans. The previous round saw a record crowd of over 10,000 pack into Newlandsfield to watch the Lok overcome Fauldhouse United. This season also saw Pollok lift their first ever West of Scotland Junior Cup after a 6–1 replay win against Glasgow Perthsire.

===Rise to prominence (1967–2002)===
The club eventually rose to prominence upon the demise of Third Lanark in 1967 with many supporters opting to support Pollok, being in close proximity on the south side of Glasgow. Pollok finally lifted a top-flight league title as they topped the Central League in 1978–79. They retained their title in 1981, alongside their first major honour, the Scottish Junior Cup, with Norrie Fulton scoring the only goal of the game at Hampden Park in front of 13,518 supporters.

Pollok lifted the Junior Cup again in 1985, when they defeated Petershill after a replay in the final with Derek Lea scoring the winning goal. This season also saw them win the second of three Central Premier Division titles in a row to make the 1980s the club&#x27;s most successful decade in their history. Their hopes of winning back to back Junior Cups were dashed in 1986 however, as they fell to a 3–2 defeat against Auchinleck Talbot in the tournament&#x27;s centenary year.

The club&#x27;s success continued into the 1990s, a decade which brought eleven trophies, including three league titles. The pinncacle though was a third Junior Cup success in 1997, as Pollok beat Tayport 3–1 at Fir Park. For the second time however, they were denied back to back cup wins, this time by rivals Arthurlie who triumphed 4–0 in the 1998 final. Manager Jim O&#x27;Donnell left, along with much of the squad, being replaced by former player Andy Dailly, who only lasted 37 matches before being replaced himself by long-serving goalkeeper Ronnie Lowrie.

===SJFA West Region (2002–2021)===
Junior football in the west of Scotland was restructured in 2002, amalgamating the Central and Ayrshire leagues to form the West Region. Prior to this Pollok had been champions of the Central league eight times. The top league of the new set up was the West Premier League which Pollok became the inaugural champions of in 2003 under Ronnie Lowrie, before further triumphs in 2005 and 2007 under Rab Sneddon.

Beginning in the 2007–08 season the SFA began inviting the winners of the four major Junior honours (Scottish Junior Cup, West Premier League, East Super League, &amp; North Premier League) to take part in the Senior Scottish Cup. Pollok were reigning champions of the West Premier League at the time, and took part in the 2007–08 Scottish Cup. In the 1st round &#x27;Lok were drawn away against St Cuthbert Wanderers of the South of Scotland League. The match took place at St. Mary&#x27;s Park, Kirkcudbright with Pollok winning comfortably by 6 goals to 2. Montrose of the Third Division were to be Pollok&#x27;s opponents in the second round. Pollok performed admirably against the Scottish League club, achieving a 2–2 draw at Links Park. In the replay at Newlandsfield &#x27;Lok were not as successful and lost 1–0.

The end of that campaign again saw Pollok crowned West Premier League Champions, after a long run of rearranged games at the end of the campaign culminated in a 5–4 win against Glenafton to secure the crown. At the start of the following season they were eliminated in the first round of the 2008–09 Scottish Cup by Edinburgh-based East of Scotland team Spartans. At the end of the season Pollok had a chance to once again retain their West Premier League championship but lost the last league game of the season away to Auchinleck Talbot by failing to defend a 1–0 lead in the last eight minutes. Having exited the Scottish Junior Cup at the semi-final stage for the second year in a row, manager Jim Sinnett promptly resigned after the game.

2009–10 did not go well for Pollok with an early exit in the Scottish Junior Cup away to Newtongrange Star. In March 2010 manager Rab Sneddon resigned for work reasons and was succeeded by Willie Irvine.

Season 2010–11 saw Pollok suffer a shock exit at home to Neilston Juniors in the Scottish Junior Cup. Season 2011–12 saw Pollok lose four of their opening seven league fixtures, prompting Willie Irvine to tender his resignation on Monday, 10 October 2011. His eventual replacement was John Richardson, who kept the club in the top flight after a relegation play-off against Renfrew. Season 2012–13 saw Pollok win both the Central Sectional League Cup and the Central League Cup as well as narrowly avoiding relegation for the second year running. Only three players were retained from the previous season for 2013–14. This season was a disaster for Pollok. The club was embroiled in many off field controversies and had four different managers throughout the season.

Tony McInally was appointed as manager in December 2013 but Pollok were finally relegated on 28 April 2014 with a 3–2 loss to Glenafton Athletic. Under McInally, Pollok were promoted as Champions the following season and won the Evening Times Champions Cup. The club reached the final of the 2015–16 Scottish Junior Cup but lost to Beith Juniors on penalty kicks after a 1–1 draw.

In 2016, the club briefly received widespread media attention after right-back Tam Hanlon scored a hat-trick of long-range goals (two free kicks and one from open play) in a match against Neilston. The feat was captured on video and quickly went viral, being viewed millions of times and leading international players and pundits to praise the quality of the goals.

Pollok won the 2017 West of Scotland Junior Cup, with a 5–4 victory on penalties against Cumnock Juniors after the match in front of over 1000 spectators at Newlandsfield had ended with the scores level at 2–2.

Pollok lifted the Central League Cup in June 2018, after a 3–1 win against Cumbernauld United in Shettleston before Tony McInally departed Newlandsfield in October 2018. and was replaced shortly after by Murdie MacKinnon, who had previously served as assistant manager.

In March 2020, Pollok played their final match as a junior club when they defeated Dalry Thistle 2–1 in the West of Scotland Cup. The next round was due to be played the following week against Irvine Meadow, but that tie was postponed before all remaining league and cup matches were cancelled by the SJFA due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pollok eventually finished third in their final West Region Premiership campaign after the title was awarded to Auchinleck Talbot on a points-per-game basis. The 2019–20 Scottish Junior Cup was eventually declared null and void in March 2021 with Pollok having reached the semi-final.

===West of Scotland Football League &amp; SFA Membership (2021–)===
In 2020, Pollok moved from the SJFA, to join the pyramid system in Scottish football as one of the inaugural members of the West of Scotland Football League.

On 11 October 2020, the club announced they would not be participating in the inaugural season of the West of Scotland League due to concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, citing safety of volunteers and players, and the financial impact on the club of pursuing a campaign with no matchday income, as the main reasons.

In July 2021, Pollok played their first competitive match as a senior side when they began their inaugural West of Scotland Football League Premier Division season with a 5–1 win at home to Blantyre Victoria in front of a crowd of 500, as full stadiums were not yet permitted under COVID-19 restrictions. Pollok&#x27;s first goal at this level was scored by Adam Forde. As members of the West of Scotland Football League, Pollok also made their debut in the South Challenge Cup in October 2021, beating Vale of Clyde in a 4–0 win at Fullarton Park in Glasgow&#x27;s East End. After a 38-game season, Pollok finished their maiden campaign in third place. The club were accepted as members of the Scottish FA on the 25th May 2022, allowing them to enter the Scottish Cup the following season. On the 19th June, Pollok confirmed via their website that they would not renew their SJFA membership.

In August 2022, Pollok returned to the Scottish Cup for the first time since 2008 with a 6–0 win at home to Girvan in the 2022 – 23 Preliminary Round. They then repeated this scoreline in the following round at home to Highland League side Huntly. They followed this up with a 4–3 win at home to Annan Athletic in the second round in front of the BBC Scotland cameras. This represented the club&#x27;s first ever victory against SPFL opposition. Manager Murdo MacKinnon resigned from his post after four years in November 2022 following a West of Scotland Cup defeat at home to Division 1 side St Cadoc&#x27;s, and was replaced by former Kirkintilloch Rob Roy manager Stewart Maxwell. His first game was the Scottish Cup Round 3 match against Ayr United at Somerset Park, as Pollok fell to a narrow 1–0 defeat against the Championship leaders.
The following season, after another third round Scottish Cup exit, Pollok reached their first final since 2018 as they fell 2–0 to Darvel in the final of the West of Scotland Football League Cup at Broadwood.

==Scottish Cup participation==
Following a restructuring of the Scottish Cup in 2007, four Scottish Junior FA clubs were admitted into the competition and Pollok took their place in the competition for the first time as champions of the SJFA West Premier League. Their first match in the competition was a thumping 6–2 win against South of Scotland side St Cuthbert Wanderers in Kirkcudbright.

The second round draw saw Pollok travel to Links Park, to face Scottish Football League opposition in competitive action for the first time in the form of Montrose. Despite taking an early lead through Robert Downes, the Lok required a late equaliser from David Turnbull to force a replay. Nearly 2000 supporters packed into Newlandsfield for the historic occasion, as the home side were narrowly edged out 1–0 in their maiden Scottish Cup campaign.

After retaining their title, Pollok again took their place in the competition in 2008, although this campaign was not as memorable. A 1–1 home draw with Spartans was followed by a 1–0 defeat in the replay, as Pollok dropped out of the competition for the next fourteen years.

Pollok narrowly lost their league crown on the last day of the 2008–09 season, and failed to win an SJFA title again before joining the West of Scotland Football League in 2020. This kicked off Pollok&#x27;s journey to achieve SFA member status, which was granted in May 2022, allowing the club entry into the following season&#x27;s Scottish Cup.
Girvan were the visitors in August 2022 as Newlandsfield hosted Scottish Cup football for the first time in fourteen years under the management of Murdo MacKinnon, and it was an emphatic return for the Lok, who won the preliminary round tie 6–0. This result was repeated in the First Round at home to Highland League side Huntly, in a match that was intended for live television coverage, which was cancelled due to a demand on resources following the death of the Queen. The second round saw Annan Athletic of SPFL League 2 come to Newlandsfield. On one of the greatest nights in the club&#x27;s history, Pollok triumphed 4–3 in front of the BBC Scotland cameras in a classic tie which represented their first ever competitive victory against SPFL opposition.

The reward for that win was a trip to Somerset Park to face Championship leaders Ayr United, the highest ranked team Pollok had ever faced in competitive action. Despite a strong defensive performance, the home side won 1–0 in front of 2425 supporters, with 726 Pollok fans among the largest crowd of the third round.

The following season again saw Pollok knocked out in the third round with a 1–0 defeat away to Brora Rangers of the Highland League, having seen off Benburb, Penicuik Athletic and Gala Fairydean Rovers in the previous rounds.

==Crest and colours==
Pollok&#x27;s badge is a simple shield containing a black and white saltire, a football and a tree, which is a nod to the coat of arms of Glasgow.

Since their formation, Pollok have played in black and white as a tribute to their first honorary President Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, who gifted the club land within the Pollok estate for use as their home park. The colours and saltire were taken from the heraldic shield of Pollok House.

==Stadium==

Pollok play their home games at Newlandsfield Park in the Newlands area of Glasgow, a ground they have used since the 1928–29 season. The stadium has a capacity of 2,088, and is entirely made up of terracing.

Pollok&#x27;s first ground was at Haggs Park in the Pollok Estate, but they were forced to move out in 1926–27 as Glasgow City Council wanted the land for school pitches. After playing temporarily at Rosebery Park and the Queen Mary Tea Gardens at Speirsbridge (in Thornliebank), they acquired Newlandsfield Park, which has been their ground ever since.

In January 2022, the club received planning permission to install floodlights at Newlandsfield. These were installed and switched on for the first time in April 2022. The first match played under the lights was a 1–0 victory against Clydebank in the WoSFL Cup quarter final in May 2022.

<text>Troon Football Club (also known as The Seasiders or The Seagulls) are a Scottish football team based in Ayrshire. They compete in the West of Scotland Football League.

Formed in 1946, they are based at Portland Park in the town of Troon in Ayrshire. The ground has a current capacity of 2,000 and is standing only. The club&#x27;s colours are blue and black vertical stripes, similar to that of Inter Milan.

==History==

===Beginnings of football in Troon===
Despite Troon being synonymous with golf, there are records to the effect that local football has a history which began approximately three years before the golf course at the end of the South Beach was ever considered.

====Troon Portland====
As far back as 1875 there was a Troon Portland football team, reckoned as seniors, though most of their matches were of necessity friendlies since no leagues of any kind were then available. But they did play clubs such as Irvine, Irvine Victoria, Ayr, Kilmarnock Athletic, Kilmarnock Portland and other county teams.

The first Troon Portland team was as follows: Goal, Frank Briggs, Backs, Charles Fullarton, David Connell, and Hugh Allison; Half backs, Robert Hastings and James Connell; Forwards. Reuben McNeillage. John Kennan, James Murchie, William Cunningham, John Johnstone. Robert Smith. and David Johnstone.

====Troon Academicals====
The first proper football club in Troon first came into being in 1889, when Troon Academicals (together with 23 other clubs) became members of the first ever Ayrshire Junior Football Association. That Troon side won the Irvine and District Cup in 1891–92 and again in 1894–95. Two of their players, D. Boyd and T. Walker, played as a left wing for Scotland against England.

The Troon Academicals name was reborn in 2009 by a Troon F.C. affiliated supporters team of the same name.

====Troon Rangers====
In 1904–05 the Ayrshire Consolation Cup was won by a Junior team named Troon Rangers.

====Troon Athletic====
Troon Athletic were founded in 1919 by the Troon Federation of ex-Servicemen with a committee headed by Tom Wallace (President) William Noble (Treasurer) and William S. Elliot (Secretary). Their home ground was at the public park in Troon from the Station Hill to the Yorke Road Bridge.

Troon Athletic joined the Kilmarnock and District Junior League, winning it at the first attempt in the 1920–21 season. Their first team was as follows ;– S. Elliott, W. Kettle, and A. Hendry; P. McAdam, G. Elliott, and H. Murdoch; J. Wright and J. Hillditch; A. Howie: J. McLean and R. Hunter.

In 1921–22, and now playing in the stronger Western league, they finished in seventh place out of nineteen clubs. the Scottish Cup saw a run to the sixth round, which was then the stage of the last sixteen clubs in the competition. Fellow Ayrshiremen, and eventual Cup winners, Kilwinning Rangers put an end to the Cup dream. However, they won the Ayrshire Junior Cup when over three thousand people watching them defeat Ardeer Thistle 2–1 at Rugby Park, home of Kilmarnock Football Club.

In 1924 the Ayrshire Consolation Cup came to town, after a 3–0 defeat of Cumnock. Another two years passed and Athletic were again in the running for honours. Semi-finalists in the Western League Cup and Ayrshire Consolation Cup, finalists in the Irvine &amp; District Cup, and in the last sixteen of the Scottish Cup, it was a season of near misses. In the Scottish Cup, they had their record win in the trophy, with a second round 11–4 win against Glasgow Highlanders, but Renfrew put the run to an end.

The four seasons in the Intermediates was relatively successful, winning the Ayrshire Intermediates Cup (1928–29) and the Gold Watch competition (1929–30) as well as being finalists in the 1930–31 Stirling Trophy. In 1935, Saltcoats Victoria defeated Athletic by a convincing four goals to nil in the final of the West of Scotland Consolation Cup, whilst 1936 saw their final piece of silverware won, in the shape of the Ayrshire Consolation Cup, with a 4–3 win against Kilbirnie Ladeside.

====Second World War====
As with most levels of football, Junior football was suspended during the period of the Second World War of 1939–1945, and Troon Athletic closed down for good in 1940 as many of the players and officials were involved in Air Raid patrols or working overtime in the local shipyard, with insufficient time to run a football club.

===Troon Juniors formed===
After the Second World War, Junior football reformed and the people of Troon grasped the opportunity of a new dawn in Scottish football in the post-war era.

Troon Juniors, a brand new club, was established in 1946 at the newly constructed Portland Park, a purpose-built stadium to give the club the opportunity to progress in Scottish football.

Troon Juniors played in the Western League North Section but the first few years saw little of any note, with league form being poor and usually ending in a lowly position. By 1953–54, the years of waiting finally bore some fruit, with sixth place achieved in the Western League, only four points behind Champions Irvine Meadow. Winners in the Land O&#x27;Burns Cup (4–0 against Kilbirnie Ladeside) and finalists in the Ayrshire Junior Cup, there was something to cheer the fans. To round off a good season, the fifth round of the Scottish Cup was reached, before losing 3–0 to Clydebank Juniors. The fourth round saw unusual opposition in Argyll side Lochgilphead, who were routed by four goals to one.

In 1955–56, as well as getting to the semi-finals of the two cups they had reached the final of two years earlier, a final placing of 5th in the league, though nineteen points off the top, was their best to date. After this, it was back to almost obscurity for a decade, with early exits and poor league form the norm.

The mid-1960s saw a brief improvement, with the first semi-final appearance in a decade (in the Western League Cup) and the following season they ended as second in the league and semi-finalists of the West of Scotland Cup. The Western League was disbanded in 1968, when Junior football was regionalised and The Ayrshire Region of the Scottish Junior Football Association was formed. We had our first taste of international recognition in 1969 when Gordon Armstrong was capped by Scotland at both Junior and Amateur level in successive weeks, playing in both matches against Wales. Troon Juniors played in the Ayrshire League Northern Section until season 1976–77 when the Sectional formation was abandoned. This was replaced by two Divisions with Troon Juniors being assigned to the Second.

===Troon Football Club===
After 1977 the term &quot;Juniors&quot; was dropped from the club title, which was the fourth occasion in the history of football in Troon that the town&#x27;s Junior club changed its name. From then on it was simply known as &quot;Troon Football Club&quot; and it was around this time that black and blue vertical stripes first appeared on the club shirts, and they have remained to this day.

At the end of the 1985–86 season, promotion to the First Division of the Ayrshire League (which had been formed upon the dissolution of the Western League in 1969) was attained, and although relegated at the end of the season, they reached the semi-finals of the Ayrshire Sectional League Cup. Troon F.C. languished in the Second Division of Ayrshire Junior Football until 1997 when after a long spell of mediocrity, Manager John Redmond led the club to the Ayrshire Second Division Championship trophy &amp; promotion to the Ayrshire Division 1.

In Season 1996-97 we won the Western League Division Two Championship by nine clear points. We also won the South Ayrshire Cup and after a 1–1 draw with Auchinleck Talbot in the Super Cup we lost out on penalties.

===Super League era===
In 2002 the new West of Scotland Region was formed and Super Leagues introduced. Troon F.C. started off that new era for Junior football in the Super League First Division and in the inaugural season, Troon F.C. finished in second place winning promotion to the Premier Division. They played in the top flight for two seasons but were relegated at the end of the second despite winning their first major honour, the West of Scotland Cup, and having their best ever run in the Scottish Junior Cup. The next three seasons were spent in the First Division where success mainly eluded the Portland Parkers. Management teams changed and season 2007–08 ended with Troon being relegated to the Ayrshire District League.

===Kirkwood regime===
In 2010 the Kirkwood family took an interest in Troon and were appointed on to the committee of the club. Jim Kirkwood Snr. was appointed as chairman, Alasdair Kirkwood as club Treasurer and Jimmy Kirkwood Jnr. as a committee member and Assistant Manager under John Redmond. The fortunes of the club improved almost immediately as an improved professionalism and business nous saw investment in the club infrastructure. The social club at Portland Park was renovated and expanded, and investment on the playing surface itself allowed an improvement in the style of play encouraged by the new coaching staff.

Jimmy Kirkwood took over as Manager in March 2011, assisted by former Troon player Gordon Burns, and an overhaul of the playing squad commenced with an emphasis on youth development &amp; attractive football. Results were erratic to begin with, but the team missed out on the second promotion spot by one point. The club went one better in 2012–13, securing second place with weeks to spare after a season long title battle with Kilwinning Rangers and promotion back to the Super League was assured. Further investment off the park saw upgraded dressing rooms, an outside area beside the social club and expanded terracing areas on the homes side.

In season 2013–14 the club were crowned the Super League First Division Champions, Ayrshire Cup winners and were also West of Scotland Cup finalists.

In the summer of 2015, work commitments saw Jimmy Kirkwood take a sideways step to become General Manager and was replaced by Gordon Burns as Troon Manager. A long unbeaten run saw Troon push for the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division title, before eventually finishing fourth in the 2015–16 season. The following season was a disaster for the club as a poor season throughout saw the club finish bottom of the Premier League and relegated to the Super League First Division. Manager Gordon Burns resigned at the end of the season and was replaced by Jimmy Kirkwood for a second spell as Manager.

Under the returning Jimmy Kirkwood, Troon won promotion at the first time of asking via the play-offs after victory against Girvan to take their place in the newly formed SJFA West Premiership.

===End of the Junior era===
In early 2020, clubs voted to leave the Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region in favour of joining the West of Scotland Football League which was now part of the Scottish Football Pyramid.

Former Troon player Jim Stewart was included in Scotland&#x27;s 1974 FIFA World Cup squad just two years after leaving the club for Kilmarnock. He was eventually capped twice by Scotland, against Chile in 1977 and Norway in 1978.

<text>Paucituberculata is an order of South American marsupials. Although currently represented only by the seven living species of shrew opossums, this order was formerly much more diverse, with more than 60 extinct species named from the fossil record, particularly from the late Oligocene to early Miocene epochs. The earliest paucituberculatans date to the late Paleocene (Itaboraian South American land mammal age). The group went through a pronounced decline in the middle Miocene epoch, which resulted in the extinction of all families of this order except for the living shrew opossums (Caenolestidae). Extinct families of Paucituberculatans include Pichipilidae, Palaeothentidae, and Abderitidae.

== Classification ==
It is one of two clades of Ameridelphia, a paraphyletic group; genetic studies have shown these animals to be a sister group to Australidelphia (i.e., Didelphimorphia branched off first).

The Paucituberculata were once considered to be closely related to South American polydolopimorph metatherians, however phylogenetic analyses have found this is not true.

=== Subdivision ===
The order is subdivided into:

* †&quot;Bardalestes&quot;

<doc id="309241" wikidata="Q23123" url="?curid=309241" title="Microbiotheriidae">
<text>Microbiotheriidae is a family of australidelphian marsupials represented by only one extant species, the monito del monte, and a number of extinct species known from fossils in South America, Western Antarctica, and northeastern Australia.

Microbiotheriids were once thought to be members of the order Didelphimorphia (which contains the Virginia opossum); however, an accumulation of both anatomical and genetic evidence in recent years has led to the conclusion that microbiotheriids and other microbiotheres are not didelphids at all, but are instead most closely related to the Australasian marsupials; together, the microbiotheres and the Australian orders form the clade Australidelphia which are now thought to have first evolved in the South American region of Gondwana.

==Biogeography and evolution==
The oldest microbiotheriid and microbiothere currently recognised is &quot;Khasia cordillerensis&quot;, based on fossil teeth from Early Palaeocene deposits at Tiupampa, Bolivia. Numerous genera are known from various Palaeogene and Neogene fossil sites in South America. A number of possible microbiotheres, again represented by isolated teeth, have also been recovered from the Middle Eocene La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island, Western Antarctica. Finally, several undescribed microbiotheres have been reported from the Early Eocene Tingamarra Local Fauna in northeastern Australia; if this is indeed the case, then these Australian fossils have important implications for understanding marsupial evolution and biogeography. The distant ancestors of the monito del monte, it is thought, remained in what is now South America while others entered Antarctica and eventually Australia during the time when all three continents were joined as part of Gondwana.

&quot;Dromiciops&quot; is thought to have evolved from members of the genus &quot;Microbiotherium,&quot; known from the early Miocene of South America, with some authors considering the genera indistinguishable. All other genera, like &quot;Pachybiotherium&quot;, had become extinct by the late Miocene.

<text>Thylacinidae is an extinct family of carnivorous marsupials from the order Dasyuromorphia. The only species to survive into modern times was the thylacine (&quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot;), which became extinct in 1936.

The consensus of authors prior to 1982 was that the thylacinid family were related to the Borhyaenidae, a group of South American predators, also extinct, that exhibited many similar characteristics of dentition. A review published in 1982 compared the skeletal structure of these groups, concluding the tarsal bones show greater affinity with the dasyurmorphs, strongly supporting the later theory that any dental similarities emerged independently via convergent evolution. Thylacinidae is currently considered to be the most basal and earliest diverging member of Dasyuromorpha, estimated to have split from other dasyuromorphs around 42-36 million years ago.

The earliest thylacinid, &quot;Badjcinus&quot; from the Late Oligocene around 28 million years ago, is estimated to have been around in weight, comparable to a living tiger quoll. Early thylacinids were unspecialised faunivores. The family exhibited its greatest diversity during the Miocene epoch, when there were several separate lineages of contemporaneous thylacinids, most of which were considerably smaller than the living thylacine. The genus &quot;Thylacinus&quot; emerged during the Early Miocene around 16 million years ago, and after the beginning of the Pliocene was the only living thylacinid genus. Over time members of the genus &quot;Thylacinus&quot; showed an increase in body and increased adaptation to hypercarnivory.

<text>The family Caenolestidae contains the seven surviving species of shrew opossum: small, shrew-like marsupials that are confined to the Andes mountains of South America. The order is thought to have diverged from the ancestral marsupial line very early. They were once included in the superorder but it is now known that Ameridelphia is paraphyletic, having given rise to Australidelphia, and thus could be considered an evolutionary grade. Genetic studies indicate that they are the second most basal order of marsupials, after the didelphimorphs. As recently as 20 million years ago, at least seven genera were in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the High Andes.

Shrews were entirely absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are currently present only in the northwestern part of the continent. Traditionally, it was thought that shrew opossums lost ground to these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Evidence suggests, however, that both groups not only overlap, but do not seem to be in direct competition, and the marsupials&#x27; larger size seems to imply that they prey on shrews and rodents. Several opossums, such as &quot;Monodelphis&quot;, also occupy small insectivore niches.

Shrew opossums (also known as rat opossums or caenolestids) are about the size of a small rat (9–14 cm long), with thin limbs, a long, pointed snout and a slender, hairy tail. They are largely carnivorous, being active hunters of insects, earthworms, and small vertebrates. They have small eyes and poor sight, and hunt in the early evening and at night, using their hearing and long, sensitive whiskers to locate prey. They seem to spend much of their lives in burrows and on surface runways. Like several other marsupials, they do not have a pouch, and it appears that females do not carry the young constantly, possibly leaving them in the burrow.

Largely because of their rugged, inaccessible habitat, they are very poorly known and have traditionally been considered rare. Several ecological factors, including density of forest, contribute to the part of the forests the shrew opossums occupy. Recent studies suggest they may be more common than had been thought. Their karyotype has also been described through contemporary research in order to better understand this organism.

<text>In probability theory, Maxwell&#x27;s theorem (known also as Herschel-Maxwell&#x27;s theorem and Herschel-Maxwell&#x27;s derivation) states that if the probability distribution of a random vector in formula_1 is unchanged by rotations, and if the components are independent, then the components are identically distributed and normally distributed.

== Equivalent statements ==
If the probability distribution of a vector-valued random variable &quot;X&quot; = ( &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; )&quot;T&quot; is the same as the distribution of &quot;GX&quot; for every &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; orthogonal matrix &quot;G&quot; and the components are independent, then the components &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; are normally distributed with expected value 0 and all have the same variance. This theorem is one of many characterizations of the normal distribution.

The only rotationally invariant probability distributions on R&quot;n&quot; that have independent components are multivariate normal distributions with expected value 0 and variance &quot;σ&quot;2&quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot;, (where &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot; = the &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; identity matrix), for some positive number &quot;σ&quot;2.

== History ==
James Clerk Maxwell proved the theorem in Proposition IV of his 1860 paper.

Ten years earlier, John Herschel also proved the theorem.

The logical and historical details of the theorem may be found in.

== Proof ==
We only need to prove the theorem for the 2-dimensional case, since we can then generalize it to n-dimensions by applying the theorem sequentially to each pair of coordinates.

Since rotating by 90 degrees preserves the joint distribution, both formula_2 has the same probability measure. Let it be formula_3. If formula_3 is a Dirac delta distribution at zero, then it&#x27;s a gaussian distribution, just degenerate. Now assume that it is not.

By Lebesgue&#x27;s decomposition theorem, we decompose it to a sum of regular measure and an atomic measure: formula_5. We need to show that formula_6, with a proof by contradiction.

Suppose formula_7 contains an atomic part, then there exists some formula_8 such that formula_9. By independence of formula_2, the conditional variable formula_11 is distributed the same way as formula_12. Suppose formula_13, then since we assumed formula_3 is not concentrated at zero, formula_15, and so the double ray formula_16 has nonzero probability. Now by rotational symmetry of formula_17, any rotation of the double ray also has the same nonzero probability, and since any two rotations are disjoint, their union has infinite probability, contradiction.

(As far as we can find, there is no literature about the case where formula_7 is singularly continuous, so we will let that case go.)

So now let formula_19 have probability density function formula_20, and the problem reduces to solving the functional equation

formula_21

<doc id="309247" wikidata="Q2927373" url="?curid=309247" title="Buachaille Etive Mòr">
<text>Buachaille Etive Mòr (), , &#x27;great herdsman of Etive&#x27;), also known simply in English as &#x27;The Buachaille&#x27;, is a mountain at the head of Glen Etive in the Highlands of Scotland. Its pyramidal shape, as seen from the northeast, makes it one of the most recognisable mountains in Scotland, and one of the most depicted on postcards and calendars.

Buachaille Etive Mòr is a large ridge nearly five miles (8 km) long, almost entirely encircled by the River Etive and its tributary the River Coupall. The ridge contains four main peaks: from north-east to south-west these are Stob Dearg (1,021.4 m), Stob na Doire (1,011 m), Stob Coire Altruim (941 m) and Stob na Bròige (956 m). Stob Dearg and Stob na Bròige are both Munros; the latter was promoted to Munro status by the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1997. To the west is the smaller ridge, Buachaille Etive Beag.

==Climbing==
The steep, craggy north-eastern face of Stob Dearg forms the classic aspect of the mountain as seen from the Kings House Hotel, and constitutes the most direct route of ascent for climbers and scramblers. Crowberry Ridge, a classic rock climb graded &quot;severe&quot;, was first climbed direct – and photographed – in 1900 by the Abraham brothers with Messrs Puttrell and Baker. Immediately to the left is Curved Ridge, one of the most famous scrambling routes.

Alternatively there is a somewhat eroded path leading steeply up the Coire na Tulaich which, in summer conditions, allows walkers to ascend the peaks, reaching the ridge about half a kilometre west of Stob Dearg.

Buachaille Etive Mòr is separated from its sister mountain of Buachaille Etive Beag to the west by the valley of Lairig Gartain. To the east lies Glen Etive, which provides an alternative route of ascent, heading up steep grassy slopes to the summit of Stob na Bròige. Another route follows the Allt Coire Altruim from the Lairig Gartain, reaching the ridge about two thirds of the way along from the north. This route is often used as descent route in conjunction with an ascent via Coire na Tulaich, forming a circular route with a walk out along the Lairig Gartain.

=== Injuries and deaths ===
It was reported in 2009 that in the previous 30 years in the same area of Buachaille Etive Mòr there had been three separate occasions when three people died.

In 1994 one person died in an avalanche on Buachaille Etive Mòr.

In February 1995, three people died when they were descending down the mountain and an avalanche occurred. In 1995 there were six people who died on Buachaille Etive Mòr.

In 2008 a person died in the same area of Buachaille Etive Mòr where an avalanche occurred in 2009.

In January 2009, three people died and one was injured in an avalanche on Buachaille Etive Mòr. The avalanche occurred in the Coire na Tulaich area of the mountain.

In the past on Buachaille Etive Mòr there have been 13 people who have died in one 12-month period.

==Lagangarbh Hut==
The only building in the vicinity of Buachaille Etive Mòr is Lagangarbh Hut, popularly referred to as a &quot;cottage&quot; on account of its appearance. It sits at the foot of Buachaille Etive Mòr, adjacent to the River Coupall, and near the A82. It is owned by the National Trust for Scotland, and managed by the Scottish Mountaineering Club, who make it available to hire as accommodation; up to 30 people can be accommodated.

==In popular culture==
Buachaille Etive Mòr appears in the background during a song sequence in the 1998 Bollywood film &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;. Together with Beinn a&#x27;Chrulaiste it can also be seen in the film &quot;Skyfall&quot;, where James Bond transports M away from the villain Raoul Silva.
It was also the setting for the pop video &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; by Nick Heyward.

==Photography==
The Buachaille has become synonymous with landscape photography in Scotland and is probably the most photographed mountain in the country. The most popular spot for this is the small waterfalls on the River Coupall to the east of the mountain. In recent years, the condition of the ground around these falls has deteriorated rapidly and many photographers now actively encourage staying away from the area to allow for regeneration. The site has also become popular for wedding photography with the mountain providing a dramatic backdrop.

<text>Mauser, originally the Königlich Württembergische Gewehrfabrik, was a German arms manufacturer. Their line of bolt-action rifles and semi-automatic pistols was produced beginning in the 1870s for the German armed forces. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Mauser designs were also exported and licensed to many countries, which adopted them as military and civilian sporting firearms. The Gewehr 98 in particular was widely adopted and copied, becoming one of the most copied firearms designs and it is the foundation of many of today&#x27;s sporting bolt-action rifles. Around 10 million Gewehr 98 style rifles were produced.

== History ==
King Frederick I of Württemberg founded the enterprise as Königliche Waffen Schmieden (literally: Royal Weapons Forges) on 31 July 1811. Originally located partly at Ludwigsburg and partly at Christophsthal, the factory was transferred to the former Augustine Cloister in Oberndorf am Neckar, where Andreas Mauser worked as the master gunsmith. Of his seven sons who worked with him there, Peter Paul Mauser showed an outstanding ability to develop methods of operation that were faster and more efficient. His older brother Wilhelm assumed many of his father&#x27;s duties as he became ill.

=== Early years ===
Peter Paul Mauser, often called Paul Mauser, was born on 27 June 1838 in Oberndorf am Neckar, Württemberg. His brother Wilhelm was four years older. Another brother, Franz Mauser, went to America in 1853 with his sister and worked at E. Remington and Sons.

Paul was conscripted in 1859 as an artilleryman at the Ludwigsburg arsenal, where he worked as a gunsmith. By December 1859, he had so impressed his superiors that he was placed on inactive military service and assigned to the royal factory at Oberndorf. Paul engaged his older brother Wilhelm in working on a new gun system during their spare time after work. Paul was the engineer and designer, while Wilhelm took on the task of manager for their interests with the Oberndorf factory.

Paul&#x27;s first invention was a cannon and its ammunition. During his entire career, he had a unique ability to produce both the gun and the ammunition for it. Following the success of the Dreyse needle gun (&quot;Zündnadelgewehr&quot;), Paul turned his energies to improving on that design and producing a new one. Paul and Wilhelm had separated due to differences during this time. After Paul developed a new turning-bolt design, Wilhelm was impressed enough to rejoin the business and succeeded in obtaining the financing to purchase machinery and continue development. While the original needle gun used a pin that pierced the base of the cartridge to ignite the primer in the middle, Mauser soon developed a needle that ignited the charge at the base, a superior design.

==== U.S. patent ====
Locally, the Dreyse needle gun had just been adopted, so the brothers turned to the Austrian ambassador to try to sell their own gun; the ambassador forwarded their new gun to Vienna for testing. It was here that Norris, an American, of the Remington company saw the new Mauser rifle design. In 1867, Norris hired the Mauser brothers to go to Liège to work on a new design. Norris also stipulated that patents were to be taken out in his name and that a royalty would be paid to the Mauser brothers for rifles sold. Norris was convinced that he could sell the design to the French to convert their Chassepot rifles. The Norris-Mauser patent was taken out in the United States. Remington was outraged at this behavior by Norris and never made an effort to sell the new rifle.

Based on the Dreyse needle gun, Paul developed a rifle with a turn-bolt mechanism that cocked the gun as it was manipulated by the user. The rifle initially used a firing needle; a later version used a firing pin and a rear-ignition cartridge. The rifle was shown to the Austrian War Ministry by Samuel Norris of E. Remington &amp; Sons. Norris believed the design could be adapted to convert Chassepot needle guns to fire metallic cartridges. Shortly thereafter, a partnership was formed in Oberndorf between Norris and the Mauser brothers. The partners went to Liège in 1867, but when the French government showed no interest in a Chassepot conversion, the partnership dissolved. Paul Mauser returned to Oberndorf in December 1869, and Wilhelm arrived in April 1870. Before leaving Liège, the Mausers insisted that he submit the rifle to Royal Prussian School of Riflemanship. The results were impressive and Wilhelm was invited to the arsenal at Spandau.

==== Model M/71 ====
Paul and Wilhelm Mauser continued development of their new rifle in Paul&#x27;s father-in-law&#x27;s home. The Mauser rifle was accepted by the Prussian government on 2 December 1871, and was accepted for service on 14 February 1872, after a requested design change to the safety lock. The Mauser brothers received an order for 3,000 rifle sights, but actual production of the rifle was given to government arsenals and large firms. The sights were produced at the Xaver Jauch house starting 1 May 1872. After an order for 100,000 rifle sights was received from the Bavarian Rifle Factory at Amberg, the Mauser brothers began negotiations to purchase the Württemberg Royal Armoury. A delay in the purchase forced them to buy real estate overlooking the Neckar River Valley, where the upper works was built that same year. A house in Oberndorf was also rented to fulfill the Bavarian order.

==== Acquisition of Königlich Württembergische Gewehrfabrik ====
The Königlich Württembergische Gewehrfabrik was acquired on May 23, 1874, after an agreement between the Württemberg government and the Mausers to produce 100,000 Model 71 rifles. The partnership of Mauser Brothers and Company was formed between the Württemberg Vereinsbank of Stuttgart and Paul and Wilhelm Mauser on February 5, 1874. By 23 May 1874, the Mauser partnership had three factories in Oberndorf.

Wilhelm Mauser suffered from health problems throughout his life, which were aggravated by his frequent business travels. A combination of these led to his death on 13 January 1882. The partnership became a stock company with the name of Waffenfabrik Mauser on 1 April 1884. The shares held by the Württemberg Vereinsbank and Paul Mauser were sold to Ludwig Löwe &amp; Company on 28 December 1887, and Paul Mauser stayed as the technical leader. Ludwig Löwe &amp; Company was fifty per cent owner of Fabrique Nationale d&#x27;Armes de Guerre, a company formed in 1889 to manufacture Mauser rifles for the Belgian government. Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken A.G. (DWM) formed on 7 November 1896 as a merger of Ludwig Löwe &amp; Company A.G., Deutsche Metallpatronenfabrik A.G., Rheinisch-Westfälischen Powder Company, and Rottweil-Hamburg Powder Company. Mauser A.G. was formed on 23 April 1897. After World War II, DWM was renamed Industrie-Werke Karlsruhe A.G. (IWK).

== Civilian market ==
Mausers were readily adapted as hunting rifles; in Africa, safari rifles were often made from Mausers. These rifles were often rechambered in larger rounds up to and including .50 caliber (12.7 mm). The adaptations usually consisted of shortening the foregrip and barrel, rechambering to accommodate popular British rounds, and minor alterations to the action. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, companies that made alterations were generally Commonwealth-based. Several proprietary big-game rounds were specifically for hunting large and dangerous game. Today, large- and small-bore Mauser-derived rifles are made all over the world for the civilian market and are popular with hunters.

Surplus military Mausers, many in mint condition, have also entered the civilian market, to be purchased by collectors and gun owners. A considerable number of surplus Karabiner 98ks were available after World War II, and some were used by Schultz &amp; Larsen in Denmark as the basis for target rifles. Some of these are still in competitive use, although with the benefit of new barrels.

The strong following enjoyed by surplus military Mausers is partly a testament to their reliability and quality of manufacture. Additionally, the comparative low cost of surplus military ammunition has served to continue their use by shooting enthusiasts, however, in recent years it is becoming more difficult to obtain as stocks dry up. That being said, vintage surplus ammunition usually requires specialized cleaning regimens to prevent aggressive and rapid metal oxidation caused by corrosive salts (moisture attracting) contained in their priming compounds. Care must be taken to thoroughly and promptly clean and neutralize these salts after firing corrosive ammunition, lest the weapon suffer metal and mechanical damage.

The first Western-made handguns introduced into South Asia were made by the Mauser company, and the term has entered the lexicon in India and the surrounding regions, to mean any heavy pistol.

=== Manufacturers ===
* John Rigby &amp; Company developed distinct rounds for its Mauser safari big-game rifles .350 Rigby, .416 Rigby, and the .450 Rigby).
* Česká Zbrojovka manufactures various Mauser 98 variants, the most notable being the CZ 550 Safari Magnum, the .375 H&amp;H Magnum, and the .458 Lott.
* Blaser Group makes a Mauser M98 rifle chambered in several medium and magnum chamberings and a M98 Safari rifle, chambered in .416 Rigby, .450 Dakota, .458 Lott, and .500 Jeffery.
* Zastava Arms manufactures several 98 Mauser variants, the best known of these being the LK M70 and M85 series, in various popular calibers ranging from .22-250 to .458 Winchester Magnum. A number of the LK M70 slightly modified versions have been widely sold in other countries.
* Carl Gustav Sweden national armory took over the manufacturing of the M94/96 and the famous target rifles CG63 and CG68.
* Husqvarna Vapenfabrik made M94-96, variant M38, M38-96, and many other civilian variations; Model 46 (46A,46B, and 46AN) in cal. 6.5×55mm, 9,3×57mm and 9.3×62mm; Model 640 (646 – 6.5×55, 648 – 8×57IS, 649 – 9.3×62) without the thumb notch. They used FN action for later models 640 and 140 series. The cross-over model 1640 Improved Mauser (over the M96) is a cross between the M98 and M96. They also produced the 1900 actions.
* Fabrique Nationale de Herstal made a M98 series, the early production being small ring and later large ring of &quot;C&quot; (early) and &quot;H&quot; (late) design. The FN actions were also used by Sako of Finland as their Hi-Power rifles, by Browning on the early Medallions, as Husqvarna small ring model 146 and large ring late model 640, and by Kodiak Arms, Connecticut. Many other arms manufacturers used the FN action.

== Mauser firearms before 1945 ==

=== Rifles ===
==== Mauser-Norris Model 67/69 rifle ====
Between 1867 and 1869, the Mauser brothers and Samuel Norris developed a single-shot bolt-action rifle. The caliber and number produced are not known. Ludwig Olson wrote that an example had at one time been on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The rifle was patented in Austria by Samuel Norris on 24 December 1867. The bolt head did not rotate, a feature chosen by Paul Mauser to &quot;protect the heads of paper cartridges from friction and possible damage while locking the bolt, and to provide a non-rotary seat for the extractor when metallic cartridges were used.&quot;

An improved version of the rifle used a coil spring wrapped around the firing pin and a safety and a cocking piece attached to the rear of the firing pin. This rifle was shown to the Prussian government, and after some design changes to the safety, was accepted for service as the Infantry Rifle Model 71 on 14 February 1872. Although it is sometimes considered a close relative of the Chassepot rifle, and borrowing Dreyse&#x27;s turning-bolt action lock, the most innovative features of the new weapon were the work of Peter Paul Mauser.

==== Model 1871 and derivatives ====

The Mauser Model 1871 was the Mauser brothers&#x27; first rifle. It was adopted by the German Empire (except for the Kingdom of Bavaria) as the Gewehr 71 or Infanterie-Gewehr 71 (I.G.Mod.71 was engraved on the rifles). Production began at the Oberndorf factory for the infantry version, which fired a black powder 11×60mm round from a long barrel. Shorter versions were introduced with the barreled Jäger and cavalry carbine.

Slightly modified versions were widely sold to other countries, firing bullets that would today be considered very large, typically 9.5mm to 11.5mm. Such large bullets were necessary due to the limitations of black powder, which hindered velocities. Serbia designed an improved version of the Model 71 in 10.15mm, made in Germany and called the Mauser-Milovanović M1878/80. In 1884 an 8-shot tubular magazine was added by Mauser to the Model 71/84. The Turkish model 1887 rifle was the first of a series of rifles produced for the Turkish Army. Its design echoed that of the German Gewehr 71/84 service rifle: a bolt-action weapon with a tubular magazine beneath the barrel. The Turkish contract specified that if any other nation ordered Mauser rifles with more advanced technology, that design would be used in the Model 1887 to fill the remainder of the Turkish order. This clause was utilized after Belgium adopted the Model 1889 rifle.

==== Models 1889/90/91 and Experimental Model 92 ====

After the Mauser brothers finished work on the Model 71/84 in 1880, the design team set out to create a small caliber repeater that used smokeless powder. Because of setbacks brought on by Wilhelm Mauser&#x27;s death, they failed to have the design completed by 1882, and the German Rifle Test Commission (&quot;Gewehr-Prüfungskommission&quot;) was formed. The commission preferred to create their own design. Paul Mauser created two different variations of the same rifle, one with a stock strengthened with a barrel shroud and a traditional design following the layout of the 71 series in hope he might be able to overturn the commission&#x27;s decision, or at least sell his design to the Kingdom of Bavaria, which adopted its own arms. The two rifles became known as the 89 Belgian (with a barrel shroud) and the 91 Argentine (with a 71 layout) Mausers, identical in their function and feed system. The main features were the ability to use stripper clips to feed the magazine (a revolution in rate of fire), and its rimless 7.65×53mm Mauser ammunition, advanced for the time.

The system proved impressive at the 1884 Bavarian Arms Trials. Both firearms were a success, but decision-makers were not convinced that the stripper feed was superior to the en-bloc system employed by Mannlicher. In response, Mauser started small-scale production of the design in an effort to interest foreign nations, but failed to convince any of the European major powers.

The Belgian attache, however, urged his government to contact Mauser, hoping the design might give them a chance to found a domestic arms industry. The heavy-barreled Mauser with the barrel shroud resulted in the founding of arms manufacturer FN Herstal. FN could not keep up with orders, so they outsourced production to the Birmingham Small Arms Company in England.

The Belgians&#x27; talks with Mauser prompted the Ottoman Empire to consider the design. In the end they ordered their own simpler variation of the 91 Argentine Mauser known as the 90 Turkish. While this was taking place, the Argentine Small Arms Commission contacted Mauser in 1886 to replace their Model 71s; since they wished to keep retraining of their armed forces to a minimum, they went for the Mauser 91. As with other early Mausers, most such arms were made by the Ludwig Loewe company, who in 1896 joined with other manufactures to form Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken.

All variations used the same 7.65 mm round-nosed cartridge. Many parts were interchangeable, with the exception of the bayonets of the 89 and 90/91; the barrel shroud made the bayonet ring too wide. The 89 Mauser rejected by Germany in 1884 entered service in 1940 with the second-line units of Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.

A non-rotating Mauser claw extractor was introduced in the Model 92. Several variations of this model participated in rifle trials for the U.S. Army of that year; the Norwegian Krag–Jørgensen rifle was ultimately chosen.

==== Spanish M93 ====
The Mauser Model 1893 is a bolt-action rifle commonly referred to as the &quot;Spanish Mauser&quot;, though the model was adopted by other countries in other calibers, most notably the Ottoman Empire. The M93 introduced a short staggered-column box magazine as standard, holding five smokeless 7×57mm Mauser rounds flush with the bottom of the rifle, which could be reloaded quickly by pushing a strip of rounds from the top of the open bolt. It still had only two locking lugs.

==== Swedish M1894 rifle ====

The Swedish army was issued the Model 94. The similar Model 1895 was sold to Mexico, Chile, Uruguay, China, Persia, and the South African states of Transvaal and the Orange Free State (Boers). A safety feature offered by the Model 1895 was a low shoulder at the rear of the receiver, just behind the base of the bolt handle, which would contain the bolt in the unlikely event that the front locking lugs sheared off due to excessive pressure. South African Mausers were highly effective against the British during the Second Boer War; these proved deadly at long ranges, prompting the British to design their own Mauser-inspired high-velocity cartridge and rifle. These rare Mauser carbines and rifles—especially the Model 1895—can be easily identified by the letters &quot;OVS&quot; (Oranje-Vrijstaat [Dutch for &quot;Orange Free State&quot;]) either marked on the weapons&#x27; receiver ring and the stock directly below, or otherwise carved into the right side of the buttstock. The British Pattern 1914 Enfield with a Mauser-style lug might have replaced the Lee–Enfield, but the exigencies of World War I prevented this from happening. The Lee–Enfield continued to see service until it was replaced by a semi-automatic L1A1 after World War II. The Germans had faced the U.S. M1917 rifle during World War I, which was the Pattern 14 rifle adapted to fire the U.S. .30-06 cartridge of the American M1903 Springfield rifle.

==== Chilean Mauser Model 1895 ====
The Mauser Model 1895 adopted as Fusil Mauser Chileno Mo 1895 by Chilean forces, is a bolt operated magazine fed rifle using the 7×57mm Mauser cartridge. It is the first major modification of the Mauser Model 1893 and was produced by Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken, known as DWM, and Ludwig Loewe Company from 1895 to 1900.

==== Model 1896 ====

On 3 November 1893, the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway adopted the 6.5×55 mm cartridge. As a result, the Swedes chambered their new service weapons, the m/94 carbine and m/96 rifle, in this round. The rifle action was manufactured relatively unchanged from 1896 to 1944, and the m/94 Carbine, m/96 Rifle, m/38 Short Rifle, and m/41 Sharpshooter models are known by collectors as &quot;Swedish Mausers&quot;. They are still sought after by military service rifle shooters and hunters. Initial production of the weapons was in Germany by Waffenfabrik Mauser, with the remainder being manufactured under license by Sweden&#x27;s state-operated Bofors Carl Gustaf factory. The m/38 short rifle was produced by Husqvarna; additional m/38s were converted from Model 96 rifles.

&quot;Swedish steel&quot; is a term for the steel used by the German Mauser, and later by Swedish manufacturing facilities, to make the m/96 rifles. Swedish iron ore contains the proper percentages of trace elements to make good alloy steel. Thus, though lacking the industrial base necessary for mass-producing steel and iron, the Swedish steel industry developed a niche market for specialty high-strength steel alloys containing nickel, copper, and vanadium. Swedish steels were noted for their strength and corrosion resistance and were especially suited for use in toolmaking, cutlery, and firearms. When Mauser was contracted to fabricate the initial production runs of Swedish Mausers in Germany due to production delays, Sweden required the use of Swedish steel in the manufacturing process. The Swedish Ordnance Office continued to specify the same Swedish steel alloy in Swedish-made Mausers until the last new-production m/38 barrelled actions were completed in 1944.

==== Model 1898 ====

In 1898, the German Army purchased a Mauser design, the Model 98, which incorporated improvements introduced in earlier models. The weapon was originally chambered for the &quot;Patrone 88&quot; and officially entered German service as the Gew. 98 on April 5, 1898. This remains by far the most successful of the Mauser designs, helped by the onset of two world wars that demanded vast numbers of rifles.

Noticeable changes from previous Mauser rifle models included better ruptured case gas venting, better receiver metallurgy, and a larger diameter receiver ring compared to previous Mauser &quot;small ring&quot; bolt-action designs that had diameter receiver rings for additional strength and safety. Mauser incorporated a third &quot;safety&quot; lug on the bolt body to protect the shooter in the event that one or more of the forward locking lugs failed. In 1903 the improved 7.92×57mm Mauser &quot;S Patrone&quot; &quot;spitzer&quot; (pointed) round was introduced. Mauser had nothing to do with the development of this round. The &quot;S Patrone&quot; provided the accuracy and barrel life improvements the German military was looking for and it was in response to the French adoption of a pointed boat-tail bullet, which offered better external ballistic performance. The bullet diameter was increased from to . Pointed or spitzer bullets give bullets a lower drag coefficient (Cd) making them decelerate less rapidly and also markedly decreases the lateral drift caused by crosswinds, improving the effective range of the cartridge.

Most existing early Model 98s and many Model 88s were modified before World War I to take the new round, designated &quot;7,9mm&quot; or &quot;S Patrone&quot; by the German military. Modified Model 88s can be identified by an &quot;S&quot; on the receiver. Due to the possibility for overpressure from the undersize barrel, the spitzer round cannot safely be used in unmodified guns, particularly with Model 88 rifles.

Paul Mauser died on 29 May 1914, before the start of World War I that August. The war caused a spike in demand for the company&#x27;s rifles. The 98 carbines were sold, as well as an experimental version with a twenty-rather than five-round box magazine. The extended magazine was not well received, however.

A number of carbine versions known as Karabiner 98s were introduced and used in World War I, some even shorter than the later K.98k. These carbines were originally only distributed to cavalry troops, but later in the war to the special storm troop units as well.

==== G98 derivatives ====

The Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr was the world&#x27;s first anti-tank rifle—the first rifle designed for the sole purpose of destroying armored targets. The weapon, essentially an enlarged G98, fired 13×92mm (.525-caliber) TuF (&quot;Tank und Flieger&quot;, &quot;tanks and aeroplanes&quot;) semi-rimmed cartridges. In May 1918, the Mauser Company began mass-producing the Mauser 13mm Tank Abwehr Gewehr Mod. 18 in Oberndorf am Neckar.

Following the collapse of the German Empire after World War I, many countries that were using Mauser models chose to develop, assemble, or modify their own G98-action rifle designs. The most prolific of them were the Czechoslovak M1922 CZ 98 and M1924 CZ and the Belgian Fabrique Nationale M1924 and M1930.

The Belgians and Czechs produced and widely exported their &quot;Mausers&quot; in various calibers throughout the 1920s and 1930s, before their production facilities were absorbed by Nazi Germany to make parts or whole rifles for the German Army. Strictly speaking, these were not &quot;Mauser&quot; rifles, as they were not engineered or produced by the German company.

To take advantage of the widespread and popular German single-shot 8.15×46mmR cartridge for use in a military firearm, a modified Gewehr 98 referred to as a &quot;Wehrmannsgewehr&quot; was designed. These were made primarily as single shots; some only had a wood block in the magazine space. These became the 1936 Olympic team rifles for the Germans.

As the restrictions on production were increasingly ignored by the Germans in the 1930s, a new Mauser, the Mauser standard model, was developed from the rifle-length Karabiner 98b. It was nominally intended for export and civilian sales. While many standard model rifles were indeed exported, it was meant primarily for use by the revived German military. It rapidly evolved into the Karabiner 98 Kurz, which was adopted by Nazi Germany as the standard infantry rifle in 1935 and saw service until the end of World War II.

==== Type A, Model B, Model K, Armee-Model C, Africa Model ====
A series of very successful hunting rifles were developed in the first decades of the 20th century. The Special Rifle Type A was the top-of-the-line sporting rifle of the early 20th century. The Model B (B for Büchse) and Model K were sport rifles offered in many configurations. The Model C, made from 1903 to 1930, was a cheap rifle made to accommodate a range of cartridges for hunting. The Mauser Africa Model, introduced around 1904 or 1905, was used mainly by settlers in Africa.

==== Model M and model S ====
The Model M was introduced in 1914. A Model S (S for &quot;stutzen&quot; or short) was also offered.

==== Mauser M1916 ====
The Mauser M1916, or Mauser &quot;selbstladekarabiner&quot; (self-loading carbine), was a semi-automatic rifle that used a delayed blowback mechanism and fed from 25-round detachable magazine. The process of developing a semi-automatic rifle cost Paul Mauser an eye when a prototype suffered an out-of-battery detonation. The mechanism was quite delicate, working reliably only when completely clean, which made the rifle unsuitable for infantry use. However, the Imperial German Flying Corps adopted the rifle for its aircraft crews in 1915, and more generally in 1916. Aerial combat provided the clean environment the rifle required, and its semi-automatic capability was an advancement over bolt-action rifles.

However, the rifle was expensive to make. The air service turned to the Swiss-produced Mondragón rifle, which was tested by the army; though less accurate than Mauser&#x27;s design, it cost about a third as much. The widespread adoption of machine guns then made all self-loading rifles obsolete in the air service.

==== Mauser 1925 Special range rifle ====
The 1925 Special range rifle was a commercial product introduced in 1925 and sold in the United States. It was intended for high accuracy range shooting. The company also produced a .22 caliber training rifle during this time frame.

==== Karabiner 98k ====

The Karabiner 98k &quot;Mauser&quot; (often abbreviated &quot;K98k&quot; or &quot;Kar98k&quot;), adopted in the mid- 1930s, became the most common infantry rifle in service in the German Army during World War II. The design was developed from the Karabiner 98b, one of the carbines developed from the Model 1898. The K98k was first adopted by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in 1935 as their standard-issue rifle, with many older versions being converted and shortened.

==== Mauser KKW cadet rifle ====
The Mauser KKW cadet rifle is a single shot, .22 caliber rifle that was introduced in 1938. It is virtually identical to the Karabiner 98k. These cadet rifles were used by all German military, paramilitary and police organizations, especially the Hitler Youth.

==== Gewehr 41 ====

The Gewehr 41 rifles, commonly known as the &quot;G41(W)&quot; or &quot;G41(M)&quot;, were semi-automatic rifles used by Nazi Germany during World War II. By 1940 the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; issued a specification to various manufacturers, and Mauser and Walther submitted prototypes that were very similar. Both Gewehr 41 models used a mechanism known as the &quot;Bang&quot; system (named after the designer of the M1922 Bang rifle). In this system, gases from the bullet were trapped near the muzzle in a ring-shaped cone, which in turn pulled on a long piston rod that opened the breech and re-loaded the gun. Both models also included inbuilt 10-round magazines that were loaded using two of the stripper clips from the Karabiner 98k, utilizing 7.92×57mm Mauser rounds, which made reloading relatively slow. The Mauser design, the G41(M), failed as it, along with its G41(W) counterpart, suffered from gas system fouling problems. Only 6,673 G41(M) rifles were produced before production was halted, and of these, 1,673 were returned as unusable.

=== Handguns ===

==== Mauser C78 &quot;zig-zag&quot; Revolver ====

The Mauser C78 zig-zag was a revolver manufactured by Mauser during the late 19th century. It was Paul Mauser&#x27;s first handgun design.

==== C1896 Pistol ====
Mauser branched out into pistol design in 1896, producing the C96, commonly known as &quot;broomhandle,&quot; designed by the three brothers Fidel, Friedrich, and Josef Feederle (often erroneously spelled &quot;Federle&quot;). All versions used detachable shoulder stock holsters. Over a million C96s were produced between 1896 and the late 1930s.

==== Mauser 1910 and 1914 pocket pistols ====

The Mauser Model 1910 was a small self-loading pistol chambered for .25 ACP (6.35 mm). It was introduced in 1910; an updated model chambered for .32 ACP (7.65 mm), the Mauser Model 1914, came out in 1914. Most of these were used by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. They were also sold commercially.

==== Mauser Model 1934 pocket pistol ====
This was a small pocket pistol chambered for .32 ACP (7.65 mm) based on the earlier Model 1910/14. The Mauser Model 1934 is virtually identical to the 1914 except for the grip, which has a more curved back. It was used by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and was also sold commercially.

==== Mauser HSc ====
The Mauser HSc was a self-loading handgun introduced in the 1940s. It was a compact double-action blowback design in .32 ACP. Production ran from 1940 until the end of World War II, and into the 1960s and early 1970s. The post-war models were also available in .380 ACP.

=== After 1940 ===
In 1940, the Mauser Company was invited to take part in a competition to re-equip the German Army with a semi-automatic rifle, the Gewehr 41. A number of impractical requirements were specified, including that the design should not use holes drilled into the barrel to take off gas for the operating mechanism, thereby requiring mechanisms that proved unreliable. Two designs were submitted, and the Mauser version, the G 41(M), failed miserably in testing. It was canceled after a short production run. The resulting design did not see real success before it was switched to a simpler gas-operated system in the Gewehr 43. During World War II, the Mauser factory in Oberndorf was strategically bombed by the Allies, resulting in the deaths of 26 workers and the destruction of the company&#x27;s power plant. French forces entered Oberndorf (which they subsequently occupied for some time) on 20 April 1945 when the town&#x27;s mayor and planning committee surrendered without any resistance; no blood was shed there on that day.
After the war in Europe, the factory was briefly put back in order to produce weapons for the now under-equipped and exhausted French military. The plant was dismantled by the occupying forces for the purpose of war reparations, most factory buildings (approximately 60% in total) were demolished and the records destroyed on orders of the local French Army commander. For a number of years, Mauser Werke manufactured precision measurement instruments and tools, such as micrometers. Edmund Heckler, Theodor Koch, and Alex Seidel, former Mauser engineers, saved what they could and founded Heckler &amp; Koch, which has since become Germany&#x27;s main small-arms manufacturer. Mauser continued to make hunting and sporting rifles. In 1994, it became a subsidiary of Rheinmetall, a manufacturer of autocannons such as the Mauser BK-27 and other munitions until 2004, when it was merged into Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH. In 1999 the civilian manufacture of hunting, defense, and sporting rifles were split off from Rheinmetall.

== Mauser ammunition ==
Paul Mauser designed the 7.65×53mm Mauser (1889) and 7×57mm Mauser (1892) rifle cartridges. These cartridges were chambered in military Mauser service rifles and were high-performance service cartridge designs compared to other contemporary smokeless powder service cartridges such as the 8mm Lebel (1886), 8×50mmR Mannlicher (1890) and .303 British (1891). Mauser also developed the 6.5×57mm, about 1890, and the 6×57mm, about 1895, both not used by any military, but saw use as hunting cartridges. The 6.5×57mm probably influenced the design of several 6.5 military cartridges. The 6×57mm became obsolete.

== Mauser firearms after 1945 ==
Mauser was formally re-established in the 1950s.

=== 1960s ===
A rifle design by Walter Gehmann was purchased, and it went into production in 1965 as the model 66. Some self-loading pistols were also offered, such as the Mauser HSc.
* Model 66
* Model 66 S
* Model 66 P

=== 1970s–1990 ===

* Model 77
* Model 86 SR
* Mauser SP66 – a sniper rifle based on the Model 66. A further upgraded model was the Mauser 86 SR.
* Mauser Parabellum

=== 1990–2004 ===
In 1995, the firearms division of Mauser was bought by Rheinmetall Berlin AG. The sale was completed in 1996 and the company was renamed Mauser-Werke Oberndorf Waffensysteme GmbH. Rheinmetall Berlin AG was renamed Rheinmetall AG in the same year.

In 1999, part of Mauser was sold to Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG), which is no longer in the arms industry. This part became Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH. In 2000, Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH was sold to Lüke &amp; Ortmeier Gruppe during the divestiture by SIG of all its firearms businesses.

In 2004, Rheinmetall Waffen Munition GmbH was formed by a merger of Mauser-Werke Oberndorf Waffensysteme GmbH with Rheinmetall W &amp; M GmbH, Buck Neue Technologien GmbH, Pyrotechnik Silberhütte GmbH and the NICO pyrotechnics Hanns-Jürgen Diederichs GmbH &amp; Co. KG.

<text>In aerospace engineering, payload fraction is a common term used to characterize the efficiency of a particular design. The payload fraction is the quotient of the payload mass and the total vehicle mass at the start of its journey. It is a function of specific impulse, propellant mass fraction and the structural coefficient. In aircraft, loading less than full fuel for shorter trips is standard practice to reduce weight and fuel consumption. For this reason, the useful load fraction calculates a similar number, but it is based on the combined weight of the payload and fuel together in relation to the total weight. 

Propeller-driven airliners had useful load fractions on the order of 25–35%. Modern jet airliners have considerably higher useful load fractions, on the order of 45–55%.

For orbital rockets the payload fraction is between 1% and 5%, while the useful load fraction is perhaps 90%.

==Examples==
For payload fractions and fuel fractions in aviation, see Fuel Fraction.

<doc id="309252" wikidata="Q192275" url="?curid=309252" title="Phosphorescence">
<text>Phosphorescence is a type of photoluminescence related to fluorescence. When exposed to light (radiation) of a shorter wavelength, a phosphorescent substance will glow, absorbing the light and reemitting it at a longer wavelength. Unlike fluorescence, a phosphorescent material does not immediately reemit the radiation it absorbs. Instead, a phosphorescent material absorbs some of the radiation energy and reemits it for a much longer time after the radiation source is removed.

In a general sense, there is no distinct boundary between the emission times of fluorescence and phosphorescence (i.e.: if a substance glows under a black light it is generally considered fluorescent, and if it glows in the dark it is often simply called phosphorescent). In a modern, scientific sense, the phenomena can usually be classified by the three different mechanisms that produce the light, and the typical timescales during which those mechanisms emit light. Whereas fluorescent materials stop emitting light within nanoseconds (billionths of a second) after the excitation radiation is removed, phosphorescent materials may continue to emit an afterglow ranging from a few microseconds to many hours after the excitation is removed.

There are two separate mechanisms that may produce phosphorescence, called triplet phosphorescence (or simply phosphorescence) and persistent phosphorescence (or persistent luminescence):

* Triplet phosphorescence occurs when an atom absorbs a high-energy photon, and the energy becomes locked in the spin multiplicity of the electrons, generally changing from a fluorescent singlet state to a slower emitting triplet state. The slower timescales of the reemission are associated with &quot;forbidden&quot; energy state transitions in quantum mechanics. As these transitions occur relatively slowly in certain materials, absorbed radiation is reemitted at a lower intensity, ranging from a few microseconds to as much as one second after the excitation is removed.

* Persistent phosphorescence occurs when a high-energy photon is absorbed by an atom and its electron becomes trapped in a defect in the lattice of the crystalline or amorphous material. A defect such as a missing atom (vacancy defect) can trap an electron like a pitfall, storing that electron&#x27;s energy until released by a random spike of thermal (vibrational) energy. Such a substance will then emit light of gradually decreasing intensity, ranging from a few seconds to up to several hours after the original excitation.

Everyday examples of phosphorescent materials are the glow-in-the-dark toys, stickers, paint, and clock dials that glow after being charged with a bright light such as in any normal reading or room light. Typically, the glow slowly fades out, sometimes within a few minutes or up to a few hours in a dark room.

The study of phosphorescent materials led to the discovery of radioactive decay.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;phosphorescence&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word &quot;φῶς&quot; (&quot;phos&quot;), meaning &quot;light&quot;, and the Greek suffix &quot;-φόρος&quot; (&quot;-phoros&quot;), meaning &quot;to bear&quot;, combined with the Latin suffix &quot;-escentem&quot;, meaning &quot;becoming of&quot;, &quot;having a tendency towards&quot;, or &quot;with the essence of&quot;. Thus, phosphorescence literally means &quot;having a tendency to bear light&quot;. It was first recorded in 1766.

The term &quot;phosphor&quot; had been used since the Middle Ages to describe minerals that glowed in the dark. One of the most famous, but not the first, was Bolognian phosphor. Around 1604, Vincenzo Casciarolo discovered a &quot;lapis solaris&quot; near Bologna, Italy. Once heated in an oxygen-rich furnace, it thereafter absorbed sunlight and glowed in the dark. In 1677, Hennig Brand isolated a new element that glowed due to a chemiluminescent reaction when exposed to air, and named it &quot;phosphorus&quot;.

In contrast, the term &quot;luminescence&quot; (from the Latin &quot;lumen&quot; for &quot;light&quot;), was coined by Eilhardt Wiedemann in 1888 as a term to refer to &quot;light without heat&quot;, while &quot;fluorescence&quot; by Sir George Stokes in 1852, when he noticed that, when exposing a solution of quinine sulfate to light refracted through a prism, the solution glowed when exposed to the mysterious invisible-light (now known to be UV light) beyond the violet end of the spectrum. Stokes formed the term from a combination of fluorspar and opalescence (preferring to use a mineral instead of a solution), albeit it was later discovered that fluorspar glows due to phosphorescence.

There was much confusion between the meanings of these terms throughout the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Whereas the term &quot;fluorescence&quot; tended to refer to luminescence that ceased immediately (by human-eye standards) when removed from excitation, &quot;phosphorescence&quot; referred to virtually any substance that glowed for appreciable periods in darkness, sometimes to include even chemiluminescence (which occasionally produced substantial amounts of heat). Only after the 1950s and 1960s did advances in quantum electronics, spectroscopy, and lasers provide a measure to distinguish between the various processes that emit the light, although in common speech the distinctions are still often rather vague.

==Introduction==

In simple terms, phosphorescence is a process in which energy absorbed by a substance is released relatively slowly in the form of light. This is in some cases the mechanism used for glow-in-the-dark materials which are &quot;charged&quot; by exposure to light. Unlike the relatively swift reactions in fluorescence, such as those seen in laser mediums like the common ruby, phosphorescent materials &quot;store&quot; absorbed energy for a longer time, as the processes required to reemit energy occur less often. However, timescale is still only a general distinction, as there are slow-emitting fluorescent materials, for example uranyl salts, and, likewise, some phosphorescent materials like zinc sulfide (in violet) are very fast. Scientifically, the phenomena are classified by the different mechanisms that produce the light, as materials that phosphoresce may be suitable for some purposes such as lighting, but may be completely unsuitable for others that require fluorescence, like lasers. Further blurring the lines, a substance may emit light by one, two, or all three mechanisms depending on the material and excitation conditions.

When the stored energy becomes locked in by the spin of the atomic electrons, a triplet state can occur, slowing the emission of light, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. Because the atoms usually begin in a singlet state of spin, favoring fluorescence, these types of phosphors typically produce both types of emission during illumination, and then a dimmer afterglow of strictly phosphorescent light typically lasting less than a second after the illumination is switched off.

Conversely, when the stored energy is due to persistent phosphorescence, an entirely different process occurs without a fluorescence precursor. When electrons become trapped within a defect in the atomic or molecular lattice, light is prevented from reemitting until the electron can escape. To escape, the electron needs a boost of thermal energy to help spring it out of the trap and back into orbit around the atom. Only then can the atom emit a photon. Thus, persistent phosphorescence is highly dependent on the temperature of the material.

Most photoluminescent events, in which a chemical substrate absorbs and then re-emits a photon of light, are fast, in the order of 10 nanoseconds. Light is absorbed and emitted at these fast time scales in cases where the energy of the photons involved matches the available energy states and allowed transitions of the substrate. In the special case of phosphorescence, the electron which absorbed the photon (energy) undergoes an unusual intersystem crossing into an energy state of different (usually higher) &quot;spin multiplicity&quot; (&quot;see term symbol&quot;), usually a triplet state. As a result, the excited electron can become trapped in the triplet state with only &quot;forbidden&quot; transitions available to return to the lower energy singlet state. These transitions, although &quot;forbidden&quot;, will still occur in quantum mechanics but are kinetically unfavored and thus progress at significantly slower time scales. Most phosphorescent compounds are still relatively fast emitters, with triplet decay-times in the order of milliseconds.

Common examples include the phosphor coatings used in fluorescent lamps, where phosphorescence on the order of milliseconds or longer is useful for filling in the &quot;off-time&quot; between AC current cycles, helping to reduce &quot;flicker&quot;. Phosphors with faster decay times are used in applications like the pixels excited by free electrons (cathodoluminescence) in cathode-ray tube television-sets, which are slow enough to allow the formation of a picture as the electron beam scans the screen, but fast enough to prevent the frames from blurring together. Even substances commonly associated with fluorescence may in fact be prone to phosphorescence, such as the liquid dyes found in highlighter pens, which is a common problem in liquid dye lasers. The onset of phosphorescence in this case can sometimes be reduced or delayed significantly by the use of triplet-quenching agents.

where S is a singlet and T a triplet whose subscripts denote states (0 is the ground state, and 1 the excited state). Transitions can also occur to higher energy levels, but the first excited state is denoted for simplicity.

==Persistent phosphorescence==

Solid materials typically come in two main types: crystalline and amorphous. In either case, a lattice or network of atoms and molecules form. In crystals, the lattice is a very neat, uniform assembly. However, nearly all crystals have defects in the stacking sequence of these molecules and atoms. A vacancy defect, where an atom is simply missing from its place, leaving an empty &quot;hole&quot;, is one type of defect. Sometimes atoms can move from place to place within the lattice, creating Schottky defects or Frenkel defects. Other defects can occur from impurities in the lattice. For example, when a normal atom is substituted by a different atom of much larger or smaller size, a substitutional defect occurs, while an interstitial defect occurs when a much smaller atom gets trapped in the &quot;interstices&quot;, or the spaces between atoms. In contrast, amorphous materials have no &quot;long-range order&quot; (beyond the space of a few atoms in any direction), thus by definition are filled with defects.

When a defect occurs, depending on the type and material, it can create a hole, or a &quot;trap&quot;. For example, a missing oxygen atom from a zinc oxide compound creates a hole in the lattice, surrounded by unbound zinc-atoms. This creates a net force or attraction that can be measured in electron-volts. When a high-energy photon strikes one of the zinc atoms, its electron absorbs the photon and is thrown out into a higher orbit. The electron may then enter the trap and be held in place (out of its normal orbit) by the attraction. To trigger the release of the energy, a random spike in thermal energy of sufficient magnitude is needed to boost the electron out of the trap and back into its normal orbit. Once in orbit, the electron&#x27;s energy can drop back to normal (ground state) resulting in the release of a photon.

The release of energy in this way is a completely random process, governed mostly by the average temperature of the material versus the &quot;depth&quot; of the trap, or how many electron-volts it exerts. A trap that has a depth of 2.0 electron-volts would require a great amount of thermal energy (very high temperature) to overcome the attraction, while at a depth of 0.1 electron-volts very little heat (very cold temperature) is needed for the trap to even hold an electron. Generally, higher temperatures cause a faster release of energy, resulting in a brighter yet short-lived emission, while lower temperatures produce a dimmer but longer-lasting glow. Temperatures that are too hot or cold, depending on the substance, may not allow the accumulation or release of energy at all. The ideal depth of trap for persistent phosphorescence at room temperature is typically between 0.6 and 0.7 electron-volts. If the phosphorescent quantum yield is high, that is, if the substance has a large number of traps of the correct depth, this substance will release a significant amount of light over a long period of time, creating a so-called &quot;glow in the dark&quot; material.

==Chemiluminescence==

Some examples of glow-in-the-dark materials do not glow by phosphorescence. For example, glow sticks glow due to a chemiluminescent process which is commonly mistaken for phosphorescence. In chemiluminescence, an excited state is created via a chemical reaction. The light emission tracks the kinetic progress of the underlying chemical reaction. The excited state will then transfer to a dye molecule, also known as a sensitizer or fluorophor, and subsequently fluoresce back to the ground state.

==Materials==

Common pigments used in phosphorescent materials include zinc sulfide and strontium aluminate. Use of zinc sulfide for safety related products dates back to the 1930s.

The development of strontium aluminate pigments in 1993 was spurred on by the need to find a substitute for glow-in-the-dark materials with high luminance and long phosphorescence, especially those that used promethium. This led to the discovery by Yasumitsu Aoki (Nemoto &amp; Co.) of materials with luminance approximately 10 times greater than zinc sulfide and phosphorescence approximately 10 times longer. This has relegated most zinc sulfide based products to the novelty category. Strontium aluminate based pigments are now used in exit signs, pathway marking, and other safety related signage.
Since both phosphorescence (transition from T1 to S0) and the generation of T1 from an excited singlet state (e.g., S1) via intersystem crossing (ISC) are spin-forbidden processes, most organic materials exhibit insignificant phosphorescence as they mostly fail to populate the excited triplet state, and, even if T1 is formed, phosphorescence is most frequently outcompeted by non-radiative pathways. One strategy to enhance the ISC and phosphorescence is the incorporation of heavy atoms, which increase spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Additionally, the SOC (and therefore the ISC) can be promoted by coupling n-π* and π-π* transitions with different angular momenta, also known as Mostafa El-Sayed&#x27;s rule. Such transitions are typically exhibited by carbonyl or triazine derivatives, and most organic room-temperature phosphorescent (ORTP) materials incorporate such moieties. In turn, to inhibit competitive non-radiative deactivation pathways, including vibrational relaxation and oxygen quenching and triplet-triplet annihilations, organic phosphors have to be embedded in rigid matrices such as polymers, and molecular solids (crystals, covalent organic frameworks, and others).

== Uses ==
In 1974 Becky Schroeder was given a US patent for her invention of the &quot;Glow Sheet&quot; which used phosphorescent lines under writing paper to help people write in low-light conditions.

Glow in the dark material is added to the plastic blend used in injection molds to make some disc golf discs, which allow the game to be played at night.

Often clock faces of watches are painted with phosphorescent colours. Therefore, they can be used in absolute dark environments for several hours after having been exposed to bright light.

A common use of phosphorescence is decoration. Stars made of glow-in-the-dark plastic are placed on walls, ceilings, or hanging from strings make a room look like the night sky. Other objects like figurines, cups, posters, lamp fixtures, toys and bracelet beads may also glow. Using blacklights makes these things glow brightly, common at raves, bedrooms, theme parks, and festivals.

== Shadow wall ==
A shadow wall is created when a light flashes upon a person or object in front of a phosphorescent screen which temporarily captures the shadow. The screen or wall is painted with a glow-in-the-dark product that contains phosphorescent compounds. Publicly, these shadow walls can be found at certain science museums.

<text>Julius Edwin Harlow (June 28, 1931 – February 12, 2024) was an American Conservative rabbi and liturgist. 

==Birth==
Harlow was born in Sioux City, Iowa, to Henry and Lena Harlow ( Lipman) in 1931.

==Career==
In 1952, he earned a B.A. at Morningside University (then Morningside College) in Sioux City, and from there went to New York City to study at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he received his &quot;semikhah&quot;—his rabbinical ordination—in 1959. He then became a staff member of the Rabbinical Assembly (RA), the international organization of rabbis in Conservative Judaism.

Harlow soon began work as a liturgist on the RA&#x27;s prayerbook committee, working with Rabbi Gershon Hadas on new &quot;siddurim&quot; (Jewish prayerbooks) for use in Conservative congregations. Under the editorship of Hadas, the two printed the &quot;Weekday Prayer Book&quot; in 1961. Harlow took a greater role by editing and translating the movement&#x27;s &quot;mahzor&quot; (the &quot;siddur&quot; Jews use specifically for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur prayers) which was published in 1972. He soon became the chief liturgist for the Conservative movement, and was the editor of &quot;Siddur Sim Shalom&quot; in 1985. &quot;Siddur Sim Shalom&quot; became the prototype for a family of later Conservative siddurim, including &quot;Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Yom Tov&quot;, &quot;Siddur Sim Shalom for Weekdays&quot; and &quot;Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom&quot;. His other publishing activities within Conservative Judaism included being a literary editor on the &quot;Etz Hayim: A Torah Commentary&quot;.

Harlow, together with his wife Navah, worked with the Masorti Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal, beginning in 2005 for the cause of the Bnei Anusim (descendants of crypto-Jews) in and of the Iberian Peninsula.

==Personal life and death== 
Harlow and his wife had two children. His son, David, is a lawyer and his daughter, Ilana, is a folklorist.

Harlow died from pneumonia on February 12, 2024, at the age of 92.

<doc id="309257" wikidata="Q203122" url="?curid=309257" title="Whistler, British Columbia">
<text>Whistler (, ; , ) is a resort municipality in Squamish-Lillooet Regional District, British Columbia, Canada. It is located in the southern Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains, approximately north of Vancouver and south of Pemberton. It has a permanent population of approximately 13,982 (2021), as well as a larger but rotating population of seasonal workers.

Over two million people visit Whistler annually, primarily for alpine skiing and snowboarding and, in the summer, mountain biking at Whistler Blackcomb. Its pedestrian village has won numerous design awards, and Whistler has been voted among the top destinations in North America by major ski magazines since the mid-1990s. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Whistler hosted most of the alpine, Nordic, luge, skeleton, and bobsled events.

== History ==

The Whistler Valley is located around the pass between the headwaters of the Green River and the upper-middle reaches of the Cheakamus. It is flanked by glaciated mountains on both sides; the Garibaldi Ranges on the side that contains the ski mountains, and a group of ranges with no collective name but that are part of the larger Pacific Ranges and are essentially fore-ranges of the Pemberton Icefield. Although there are a few other routes through the maze of mountains between the basin of the Lillooet River just east, the Cheakamus-Green divide is the lowest and most direct.

===Indigenous settlement===
Before Whistler was founded, it was the shared ancestral territories of the indigenous Squamish people (Sk̲wx̲wúmesh), known in English as the Squamish Nation, and L̓il̓watú, known in English as Lil&#x27;wat First Nation (originally Srapúl). Their history is tied to the rivers, lakes, and mountains that were used as reference for direction and travel. In the Late Pleistocene era, long before European settlement, Sk̲wx̲wúmesh and L̓il̓watú shared a village known as Spoez at the confluence of Rubble Creek and the Cheakamus River at Function Junction in Whistler.&quot; This location represents the long-standing relationship of the two nations who used Spoez as a hub of trade and commerce between the two nations. Spoez was buried after Black Tusk Volcano erupted causing a massive rockslide that buried the ancient village under hundreds of metres of rubble. From this point forward both Nations continued to co-habitat within the region travelling to the area in the warmer months where they established seasonal camps for hunting and trapping. Prior to settlement of the first European fishing and trapping communities, L̓il̓watú Nation members lived in camps along Green Lake, but were ousted by police in order to make way for the railway and other infrastructure around the lake. Evidence was found of an Istken pit-house on the land that became the Squamish Lil’wat Cultural Centre, which was used by the Wolf Clan (now known as the Wallace Family) as shelter.

===European settlement===

The first British survey by the Royal Navy took place in the 1860s. These surveyors named the mountain London Mountain because of the heavy fog and cloud typically gathering around the mountain, but the area informally acquired the name &quot;Whistler&quot; due to the call of the hoary marmot. In the late 19th century, a trail was cut through the valley, linking Lillooet via Pemberton with Burrard Inlet via a pass from Squamish to the Seymour River. The trail was completed in 1877, but because of the difficult and unforgiving terrain, it was only used once for its intended purpose, which was to drive cattle. The area began to attract trappers and prospectors (such as John Millar and Henry Horstman) who established small camps in the area in the early 20th century. The area began to gain recognition with the arrival of Myrtle (who the Myrtle Philip school was named after) and Alex Philip, who in 1914 purchased of land on Alta Lake and established the Rainbow Lodge. The Philips had relocated from Maine to Vancouver in 1910 and had heard rumours of the natural beauty of the area from Pemberton pioneer John Millar. After an exploratory journey, the couple was convinced. Rainbow Lodge and other railway-dependent tourist resorts were collectively known as Alta Lake. Along with the rest of the valley bridging the Cheakamus (pron. CHEEK-a-mus) and Green River (a tributary of the Lillooet River) basins, they became part of British Columbia&#x27;s first Resort Municipality in 1975.

Completion of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway in 1914 greatly reduced the travel time from three days, providing ease of access from Vancouver, and the Rainbow Lodge gained a reputation as the most popular vacation destination west of the Rockies. The lodge was primarily a summer destination, with boating, fishing and hiking among the most popular activities, and soon other lodges began to open not just on Alta Lake, but on other valley lakes as well.

Appreciation of the outdoors was not the only activity in the valley, however. Logging was a booming industry. During the first half of the 20th century, most of the lower slopes of the surrounding mountains were cleared of old-growth. At its peak, four mills were in operation, most located around Green Lake. Prospecting and trapping were pursued as well, though no claims of great value were ever staked.

== Activities ==
Whistler is known for its skiing and snowboarding in the winter and mountain biking and hiking in the summer. Other winter activities that are enjoyed in Whistler are cross country skiing, skate skiing, ice skating, snowshoeing, backcountry skiing, telemark skiing, and tobogganing. Summer activities enjoyed in Whistler include golfing, fishing, trail running, mountain biking, outdoor yoga, and hiking.

For skiing, arguably the main attraction of Whistler, the different run difficulties (easiest to hardest) are green (circle), blue (square), black (diamond), and double black (diamond). Throughout the year each run&#x27;s difficulty stays the same. There are many signs around the mountain that indicate the difficulty of the runs and there are &quot;expert only&quot; signs at the bottom of some chairlifts indicating that most of the runs accessible from that chair are black diamonds or double black diamonds.

== 1968, 1976 and 2010 Winter Olympics ==
Until the 1960s, this quiet area was without basic infrastructure. There were no sewage facilities, water, or electricity, and no road from Squamish or Vancouver. In 1962, four Vancouver businessmen began to explore the area with the intent of building a ski resort and bidding for the 1968 Winter Olympics. Garibaldi Lift Company was formed, shares were sold, and in 1966, Whistler Mountain opened to the public.

Later, the town, then still known as Alta Lake, was offered the 1976 Winter Olympics after the selected host city Denver declined the games due to funding issues. Alta Lake &quot;Whistler&quot; declined as well, after elections ushered in a local government less enthusiastic about the Olympics. The 1976 Winter Olympics were ultimately held in Innsbruck, Austria.

Whistler was the Host Mountain Resort of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games, the first time the International Olympic Committee has bestowed that designation on a community. Whistler hosted the alpine technical and speed events, the sliding events at Fitzsimmons Creek, the Nordic events in the nearby Callaghan Valley and all the Paralympic events except the opening ceremonies, sledge hockey and wheelchair curling.

The Whistler Olympic and Paralympic Village (commonly referred to as the Athlete&#x27;s village) housed around 2,400 athletes, coaches, trainers and officials. Post-games, the site has been turned into a new residential neighbourhood, Cheakamus Crossing.

South of the village is Squamish, British Columbia, about a drive. Also located south is Vancouver, which is south of the village.

== Climate ==
Whistler has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dsb/Dfb&quot;) or an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb/Cfb&quot;) depending on the isotherm used. It has cold wet winters with significant snowfall and cloud cover, and warm summers which are somewhat dry. On average, Whistler receives approximately 11 days with temperatures over and approximately 24 days with temperatures falling below .

=== Flora ===
Whistler is a collection of microclimates ranging from coniferous mixed forest on the valley floor, to slightly drier slopes, to alpine tundra in the alpine.

The wet West Coast marine temperate climate in the valley floor is characterized by a coniferous mixed forest, with a preponderance of western red cedar—a continuation of the rainforest of the Pacific Northwest.

The slopes are slightly drier and are also coniferous mixed forest with western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;) and mountain hemlock (&quot;Tsuga mertensiana&quot;), Whistler hybrid spruce (Sitka spruce and Engelmann spruce). The last is &quot;a hybrid spruce that is unique to Whistler, aptly dubbed the &quot;Whistler Spruce&quot;. &quot;The Whistler spruce hybrid is indicative of Whistler&#x27;s geographic position—we&#x27;re not quite coastal, but not quite interior&quot;. It is a hybrid of the wetter West Coast Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;), which ranges from Northern California to Alaska, and the drier Interior Engelmann spruce (&quot;Picea engelmannii&quot;). Others include the Douglas fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;), lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;), and endangered whitebark pine (&quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot;).

The higher slopes transition to many species of scrub juniper, Rocky Mountain juniper (&quot;Juniperus scopulorum&quot;), and many species of scrub willow in the genus &quot;Salix&quot; at the tree line, and to Arctic tundra-like conditions in the high alpine above the tree line.

Both the valley floor and the mountain sides are characterized as mixed forest, predominantly conifers, but with a peppering of a few deciduous trees like the Pacific dogwood (&quot;Cornus nuttallii&quot;), locally extinct Pacific crabapple (&quot;Malus fusca&quot;) or &quot;Pryus fusca&quot;, bitter cherry (&quot;Prunus emarginata&quot;), pin cherry (&quot;Prunus pensylvanica&quot;), choke cherry (&quot;Prunus virginiana&quot;), red alder (&quot;Alnus rubra&quot;), Sitka alder (&quot;Alnus sinuata&quot;), paper birch (&quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;), big leaf maple (&quot;Acer macrophyllum&quot;), and Douglas maple (&quot;Acer glabrum&quot;).

Whistler was clear cut twice. The Oregon grape &quot;Mahonia aquifolium&quot; (AKA hollyleaved barberry) and highbush cranberry &quot;Viburnum opulus&quot; were accidentally re-introduced as escaped landscaping plants, and may all be Oregonian subspecies. All the wild Pacific crabapples were dug up by Pemberton Pioneers for grafting rootstock. It is unclear whether the Chickasaw plum (&quot;Prunus americana&quot;) was indigenous or introduced by Indigenous transcontinental trade networks or later Western contact. All the wild plums were dug up too by Pemberton Pioneers for fruit trees to transplant and as rootstock. Once abundant on the forest floor, lingonberry (&quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot;) is no longer found because of the loss of habitat through the clear-cutting.

== Education ==
The School District 48 Sea to Sky operates public schools in Whistler. There are two elementary schools, Myrtle Phillip Elementary and Spring Creek Elementary. There is one high school in the community, it is named Whistler Secondary School.

<text>Nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also known as manifold learning, is any of various related techniques that aim to project high-dimensional data, potentially existing across non-linear manifolds which cannot be adequately captured by linear decomposition methods, onto lower-dimensional latent manifolds, with the goal of either visualizing the data in the low-dimensional space, or learning the mapping (either from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional embedding or vice versa) itself. The techniques described below can be understood as generalizations of linear decomposition methods used for dimensionality reduction, such as singular value decomposition and principal component analysis.

== Applications of NLDR ==

High dimensional data can be hard for machines to work with, requiring significant time and space for analysis. It also presents a challenge for humans, since it&#x27;s hard to visualize or understand data in more than three dimensions. Reducing the dimensionality of a data set, while keep its essential features relatively intact, can make algorithms more efficient and allow analysts to visualize trends and patterns.

The reduced-dimensional representations of data are often referred to as &quot;intrinsic variables&quot;. This description implies that these are the values from which the data was produced. For example, consider a dataset that contains images of a letter &#x27;A&#x27;, which has been scaled and rotated by varying amounts. Each image has 32×32 pixels. Each image can be represented as a vector of 1024 pixel values. Each row is a sample on a two-dimensional manifold in 1024-dimensional space (a Hamming space). The intrinsic dimensionality is two, because two variables (rotation and scale) were varied in order to produce the data. Information about the shape or look of a letter &#x27;A&#x27; is not part of the intrinsic variables because it is the same in every instance. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction will discard the correlated information (the letter &#x27;A&#x27;) and recover only the varying information (rotation and scale). The image to the right shows sample images from this dataset (to save space, not all input images are shown), and a plot of the two-dimensional points that results from using a NLDR algorithm (in this case, Manifold Sculpting was used) to reduce the data into just two dimensions.

By comparison, if principal component analysis, which is a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, is used to reduce this same dataset into two dimensions, the resulting values are not so well organized. This demonstrates that the high-dimensional vectors (each representing a letter &#x27;A&#x27;) that sample this manifold vary in a non-linear manner.

It should be apparent, therefore, that NLDR has several applications in the field of computer-vision. For example, consider a robot that uses a camera to navigate in a closed static environment. The images obtained by that camera can be considered to be samples on a manifold in high-dimensional space, and the intrinsic variables of that manifold will represent the robot&#x27;s position and orientation.

Invariant manifolds are of general interest for model order reduction in dynamical systems. In particular, if there is an attracting invariant manifold in the phase space, nearby trajectories will converge onto it and stay on it indefinitely, rendering it a candidate for dimensionality reduction of the dynamical system. While such manifolds are not guaranteed to exist in general, the theory of spectral submanifolds (SSM) gives conditions for the existence of unique attracting invariant objects in a broad class of dynamical systems. Active research in NLDR seeks to unfold the observation manifolds associated with dynamical systems to develop modeling techniques.

Some of the more prominent nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques are listed below.

== Important concepts ==

=== Sammon&#x27;s mapping ===

Sammon&#x27;s mapping is one of the first and most popular NLDR techniques.

=== Self-organizing map ===

The self-organizing map (SOM, also called &quot;Kohonen map&quot;) and its probabilistic variant generative topographic mapping (GTM) use a point representation in the embedded space to form a latent variable model based on a non-linear mapping from the embedded space to the high-dimensional space. These techniques are related to work on density networks, which also are based around the same probabilistic model.

=== Kernel principal component analysis ===

Perhaps the most widely used algorithm for dimensional reduction is kernel PCA. PCA begins by computing the covariance matrix of the formula_1 matrix formula_2

:formula_3

It then projects the data onto the first &quot;k&quot; eigenvectors of that matrix. By comparison, KPCA begins by computing the covariance matrix of the data after being transformed into a higher-dimensional space,

:formula_4

It then projects the transformed data onto the first &quot;k&quot; eigenvectors of that matrix, just like PCA. It uses the kernel trick to factor away much of the computation, such that the entire process can be performed without actually computing formula_5. Of course formula_6 must be chosen such that it has a known corresponding kernel. Unfortunately, it is not trivial to find a good kernel for a given problem, so KPCA does not yield good results with some problems when using standard kernels. For example, it is known to perform poorly with these kernels on the Swiss roll manifold. However, one can view certain other methods that perform well in such settings (e.g., Laplacian Eigenmaps, LLE) as special cases of kernel PCA by constructing a data-dependent kernel matrix.

KPCA has an internal model, so it can be used to map points onto its embedding that were not available at training time.

=== Principal curves and manifolds ===

Principal curves and manifolds give the natural geometric framework for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and extend the geometric interpretation of PCA by explicitly constructing an embedded manifold, and by encoding using standard geometric projection onto the manifold. This approach was originally proposed by Trevor Hastie in his 1984 thesis, which he formally introduced in 1989. This idea has been explored further by many authors.
How to define the &quot;simplicity&quot; of the manifold is problem-dependent, however, it is commonly measured by the intrinsic dimensionality and/or the smoothness of the manifold. Usually, the principal manifold is defined as a solution to an optimization problem. The objective function includes a quality of data approximation and some penalty terms for the bending of the manifold. The popular initial approximations are generated by linear PCA and Kohonen&#x27;s SOM.

=== Laplacian eigenmaps ===

Laplacian eigenmaps uses spectral techniques to perform dimensionality reduction. This technique relies on the basic assumption that the data lies in a low-dimensional manifold in a high-dimensional space. This algorithm cannot embed out-of-sample points, but techniques based on Reproducing kernel Hilbert space regularization exist for adding this capability. Such techniques can be applied to other nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms as well.

Traditional techniques like principal component analysis do not consider the intrinsic geometry of the data. Laplacian eigenmaps builds a graph from neighborhood information of the data set. Each data point serves as a node on the graph and connectivity between nodes is governed by the proximity of neighboring points (using e.g. the k-nearest neighbor algorithm). The graph thus generated can be considered as a discrete approximation of the low-dimensional manifold in the high-dimensional space. Minimization of a cost function based on the graph ensures that points close to each other on the manifold are mapped close to each other in the low-dimensional space, preserving local distances. The eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on the manifold serve as the embedding dimensions, since under mild conditions this operator has a countable spectrum that is a basis for square integrable functions on the manifold (compare to Fourier series on the unit circle manifold). Attempts to place Laplacian eigenmaps on solid theoretical ground have met with some success, as under certain nonrestrictive assumptions, the graph Laplacian matrix has been shown to converge to the Laplace–Beltrami operator as the number of points goes to infinity.

=== Isomap ===

Isomap is a combination of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm with classic Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). Classic MDS takes a matrix of pair-wise distances between all points and computes a position for each point. Isomap assumes that the pair-wise distances are only known between neighboring points, and uses the Floyd–Warshall algorithm to compute the pair-wise distances between all other points. This effectively estimates the full matrix of pair-wise geodesic distances between all of the points. Isomap then uses classic MDS to compute the reduced-dimensional positions of all the points. Landmark-Isomap is a variant of this algorithm that uses landmarks to increase speed, at the cost of some accuracy.

In manifold learning, the input data is assumed to be sampled from a low dimensional manifold that is embedded inside of a higher-dimensional vector space. The main intuition behind MVU is to exploit the local linearity of manifolds and create a mapping that preserves local neighbourhoods at every point of the underlying manifold.

=== Locally-linear embedding ===

Locally-linear Embedding (LLE) was presented at approximately the same time as Isomap. It has several advantages over Isomap, including faster optimization when implemented to take advantage of sparse matrix algorithms, and better results with many problems. LLE also begins by finding a set of the nearest neighbors of each point. It then computes a set of weights for each point that best describes the point as a linear combination of its neighbors. Finally, it uses an eigenvector-based optimization technique to find the low-dimensional embedding of points, such that each point is still described with the same linear combination of its neighbors. LLE tends to handle non-uniform sample densities poorly because there is no fixed unit to prevent the weights from drifting as various regions differ in sample densities. LLE has no internal model.

The original data points formula_7, and the goal of LLE is to embed each point formula_8 to some low-dimensional point formula_9, where formula_10.

LLE has two steps. In the first step, it computes, for each point &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, the best approximation of &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; based on barycentric coordinates of its neighbors &quot;X&quot;&quot;j&quot;. The original point is approximately reconstructed by a linear combination, given by the weight matrix &quot;W&quot;&quot;ij&quot;, of its neighbors. The reconstruction error is:

:formula_11

The weights &quot;W&quot;&quot;ij&quot; refer to the amount of contribution the point &quot;X&quot;&quot;j&quot; has while reconstructing the point &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The cost function is minimized under two constraints:

* Each data point &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is reconstructed only from its neighbors. That is, formula_12 if point &quot;X&quot;&quot;j&quot; is not a neighbor of the point &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
* The sum of every row of the weight matrix equals 1, that is, formula_13.
These two constraints ensure that formula_14 is unaffected by rotation and translation.

In the second step, a neighborhood preserving map is created based the weights. Each point formula_7 is mapped onto a point formula_9 by minimizing another cost:

:formula_17

Unlike in the previous cost function, the weights Wij are kept fixed and the minimization is done on the points Yi to optimize the coordinates. This minimization problem can be solved by solving a sparse &quot;N&quot; X &quot;N&quot; eigenvalue problem (&quot;N&quot; being the number of data points), whose bottom &quot;d&quot; nonzero eigen vectors provide an orthogonal set of coordinates.

The only hyperparameter in the algorithm is what counts as a &quot;neighbor&quot; of a point. Generally the data points are reconstructed from &quot;K&quot; nearest neighbors, as measured by Euclidean distance. In this case, the algorithm has only one integer-valued hyperparameter &quot;K,&quot; which can be chosen by cross validation.

==== Hessian locally-linear embedding (Hessian LLE) ====

Like LLE, Hessian LLE is also based on sparse matrix techniques. It tends to yield results of a much higher quality than LLE. Unfortunately, it has a very costly computational complexity, so it is not well-suited for heavily sampled manifolds. It has no internal model.

==== Modified Locally-Linear Embedding (MLLE) ====

Modified LLE (MLLE) is another LLE variant which uses multiple weights in each neighborhood to address the local weight matrix conditioning problem which leads to distortions in LLE maps. Loosely speaking the multiple weights are the local orthogonal projection of the original weights produced by LLE. The creators of this regularised variant are also the authors of Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), which is implicit in the MLLE formulation when realising that the global optimisation of the orthogonal projections of each weight vector, in-essence, aligns the local tangent spaces of every data point. The theoretical and empirical implications from the correct application of this algorithm are far-reaching.

=== Local tangent space alignment ===

LTSA is based on the intuition that when a manifold is correctly unfolded, all of the tangent hyperplanes to the manifold will become aligned. It begins by computing the &quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbors of every point. It computes the tangent space at every point by computing the &quot;d&quot;-first principal components in each local neighborhood. It then optimizes to find an embedding that aligns the tangent spaces.

=== Maximum variance unfolding ===

Maximum Variance Unfolding, Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding share a common intuition relying on the notion that if a manifold is properly unfolded, then variance over the points is maximized. Its initial step, like Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding, is finding the &quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbors of every point. It then seeks to solve the problem of maximizing the distance between all non-neighboring points, constrained such that the distances between neighboring points are preserved. The primary contribution of this algorithm is a technique for casting this problem as a semidefinite programming problem. Unfortunately, semidefinite programming solvers have a high computational cost. Like Locally Linear Embedding, it has no internal model.

=== Autoencoders ===

An autoencoder is a feed-forward neural network which is trained to approximate the identity function. That is, it is trained to map from a vector of values to the same vector. When used for dimensionality reduction purposes, one of the hidden layers in the network is limited to contain only a small number of network units. Thus, the network must learn to encode the vector into a small number of dimensions and then decode it back into the original space. Thus, the first half of the network is a model which maps from high to low-dimensional space, and the second half maps from low to high-dimensional space. Although the idea of autoencoders is quite old, training of deep autoencoders has only recently become possible through the use of restricted Boltzmann machines and stacked denoising autoencoders. Related to autoencoders is the NeuroScale algorithm, which uses stress functions inspired by multidimensional scaling and Sammon mappings (see above) to learn a non-linear mapping from the high-dimensional to the embedded space. The mappings in NeuroScale are based on radial basis function networks.

=== Gaussian process latent variable models ===

Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVM) are probabilistic dimensionality reduction methods that use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to find a lower dimensional non-linear embedding of high dimensional data. They are an extension of the Probabilistic formulation of PCA. The model is defined probabilistically and the latent variables are then marginalized and parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood. Like kernel PCA they use a kernel function to form a non linear mapping (in the form of a Gaussian process). However, in the GPLVM the mapping is from the embedded(latent) space to the data space (like density networks and GTM) whereas in kernel PCA it is in the opposite direction. It was originally proposed for visualization of high dimensional data but has been extended to construct a shared manifold model between two observation spaces.
GPLVM and its many variants have been proposed specially for human motion modeling, e.g., back constrained GPLVM, GP dynamic model (GPDM), balanced GPDM (B-GPDM) and topologically constrained GPDM. To capture the coupling effect of the pose and gait manifolds in the gait analysis, a multi-layer joint gait-pose manifolds was proposed.

=== t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ===
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is widely used. It is one of a family of stochastic neighbor embedding methods. The algorithm computes the probability that pairs of datapoints in the high-dimensional space are related, and then chooses low-dimensional embeddings which produce a similar distribution.

== Other algorithms ==
=== Relational perspective map ===
Relational perspective map is a multidimensional scaling algorithm. The algorithm finds a configuration of data points on a manifold by simulating a multi-particle dynamic system on a closed manifold, where data points are mapped to particles and distances (or dissimilarity) between data points represent a repulsive force. As the manifold gradually grows in size the multi-particle system cools down gradually and converges to a configuration that reflects the distance information of the data points.

Relational perspective map was inspired by a physical model in which positively charged particles move freely on the surface of a ball. Guided by the Coulomb force between particles, the minimal energy configuration of the particles will reflect the strength of repulsive forces between the particles.

The Relational perspective map was introduced in.
The algorithm firstly used the flat torus as the image manifold, then it has been extended (in the software VisuMap to use other types of closed manifolds, like the sphere, projective space, and Klein bottle, as image manifolds.

=== Contagion maps ===

Contagion maps use multiple contagions on a network to map the nodes as a point cloud. In the case of the Global cascades model the speed of the spread can be adjusted with the threshold parameter formula_18. For formula_19 the contagion map is equivalent to the Isomap algorithm.

=== Curvilinear component analysis ===

Curvilinear component analysis (CCA) looks for the configuration of points in the output space that preserves original distances as much as possible while focusing on small distances in the output space (conversely to Sammon&#x27;s mapping which focus on small distances in original space).

It should be noticed that CCA, as an iterative learning algorithm, actually starts with focus on large distances (like the Sammon algorithm), then gradually change focus to small distances. The small distance information will overwrite the large distance information, if compromises between the two have to be made.

The stress function of CCA is related to a sum of right Bregman divergences.

=== Curvilinear distance analysis ===

CDA trains a self-organizing neural network to fit the manifold and seeks to preserve geodesic distances in its embedding. It is based on Curvilinear Component Analysis (which extended Sammon&#x27;s mapping), but uses geodesic distances instead.

=== Diffeomorphic dimensionality reduction ===

Diffeomorphic Dimensionality Reduction or &quot;Diffeomap&quot; learns a smooth diffeomorphic mapping which transports the data onto a lower-dimensional linear subspace. The methods solves for a smooth time indexed vector field such that flows along the field which start at the data points will end at a lower-dimensional linear subspace, thereby attempting to preserve pairwise differences under both the forward and inverse mapping.

=== Manifold alignment ===
Manifold alignment takes advantage of the assumption that disparate data sets produced by similar generating processes will share a similar underlying manifold representation. By learning projections from each original space to the shared manifold, correspondences are recovered and knowledge from one domain can be transferred to another. Most manifold alignment techniques consider only two data sets, but the concept extends to arbitrarily many initial data sets.

=== Diffusion maps ===
Diffusion maps leverages the relationship between heat diffusion and a random walk (Markov Chain); an analogy is drawn between the diffusion operator on a manifold and a Markov transition matrix operating on functions defined on the graph whose nodes were sampled from the manifold. In particular, let a data set be represented by formula_20. The underlying assumption of diffusion map is that the high-dimensional data lies on a low-dimensional manifold of dimension formula_21. Let X represent the data set and formula_22 represent the distribution of the data points on X. Further, define a kernel which represents some notion of affinity of the points in X. The kernel formula_23 has the following properties

: formula_24

&quot;k&quot; is symmetric

: formula_25

&quot;k&quot; is positivity preserving

Thus one can think of the individual data points as the nodes of a graph and the kernel &quot;k&quot; as defining some sort of affinity on that graph. The graph is symmetric by construction since the kernel is symmetric. It is easy to see here that from the tuple (X,k) one can construct a reversible Markov Chain. This technique is common to a variety of fields and is known as the graph Laplacian.

For example, the graph K = (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) can be constructed using a Gaussian kernel.

: formula_26

In the above equation, formula_27 denotes that formula_28 is a nearest neighbor of formula_29. Properly, Geodesic distance should be used to actually measure distances on the manifold. Since the exact structure of the manifold is not available, for the nearest neighbors the geodesic distance is approximated by euclidean distance. The choice formula_30 modulates our notion of proximity in the sense that if formula_31 then formula_32 and if formula_33 then formula_34. The former means that very little diffusion has taken place while the latter implies that the diffusion process is nearly complete. Different strategies to choose formula_30 can be found in.

In order to faithfully represent a Markov matrix, formula_36 must be normalized by the corresponding degree matrix formula_37:

: formula_38

formula_39 now represents a Markov chain. formula_40 is the probability of transitioning from formula_28 to formula_42 in one time step. Similarly the probability of transitioning from formula_28 to formula_42 in t time steps is given by formula_45. Here formula_46 is the matrix formula_39 multiplied by itself t times.

The Markov matrix formula_39 constitutes some notion of local geometry of the data set X. The major difference between diffusion maps and principal component analysis is that only local features of the data are considered in diffusion maps as opposed to taking correlations of the entire data set.

formula_36 defines a random walk on the data set which means that the kernel captures some local geometry of data set. The Markov chain defines fast and slow directions of propagation through the kernel values. As the walk propagates forward in time, the local geometry information aggregates in the same way as local transitions (defined by differential equations) of the dynamical system. The metaphor of diffusion arises from the definition of a family diffusion distance formula_50

: formula_51

For fixed t, formula_52 defines a distance between any two points of the data set based on path connectivity: the value of formula_53 will be smaller the more paths that connect x to y and vice versa. Because the quantity formula_53 involves a sum over of all paths of length t, formula_52 is much more robust to noise in the data than geodesic distance. formula_52 takes into account all the relation between points x and y while calculating the distance and serves as a better notion of proximity than just Euclidean distance or even geodesic distance.

=== Local multidimensional scaling ===

Local Multidimensional Scaling performs multidimensional scaling in local regions, and then uses convex optimization to fit all the pieces together.

=== Nonlinear PCA ===

Nonlinear PCA (NLPCA) uses backpropagation to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to fit to a manifold. Unlike typical MLP training, which only updates the weights, NLPCA updates both the weights and the inputs. That is, both the weights and inputs are treated as latent values. After training, the latent inputs are a low-dimensional representation of the observed vectors, and the MLP maps from that low-dimensional representation to the high-dimensional observation space.

=== Data-driven high-dimensional scaling ===

Data-driven high-dimensional scaling (DD-HDS) is closely related to Sammon&#x27;s mapping and curvilinear component analysis except that (1) it simultaneously penalizes false neighborhoods and tears by focusing on small distances in both original and output space, and that (2) it accounts for concentration of measure phenomenon by adapting the weighting function to the distance distribution.

=== Manifold sculpting ===

Manifold Sculpting uses graduated optimization to find an embedding. Like other algorithms, it computes the &quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbors and tries to seek an embedding that preserves relationships in local neighborhoods. It slowly scales variance out of higher dimensions, while simultaneously adjusting points in lower dimensions to preserve those relationships. If the rate of scaling is small, it can find very precise embeddings. It boasts higher empirical accuracy than other algorithms with several problems. It can also be used to refine the results from other manifold learning algorithms. It struggles to unfold some manifolds, however, unless a very slow scaling rate is used. It has no model.

=== RankVisu ===

RankVisu is designed to preserve rank of neighborhood rather than distance. RankVisu is especially useful on difficult tasks (when the preservation of distance cannot be achieved satisfyingly). Indeed, the rank of neighborhood is less informative than distance (ranks can be deduced from distances but distances cannot be deduced from ranks) and its preservation is thus easier.

=== Topologically constrained isometric embedding ===

Topologically constrained isometric embedding (TCIE) is an algorithm based on approximating geodesic distances after filtering geodesics inconsistent with the Euclidean metric. Aimed at correcting the distortions caused when Isomap is used to map intrinsically non-convex data, TCIE uses weight least-squares MDS in order to obtain a more accurate mapping. The TCIE algorithm first detects possible boundary points in the data, and during computation of the geodesic length marks inconsistent geodesics, to be given a small weight in the weighted stress majorization that follows.

=== Uniform manifold approximation and projection ===
Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique. It is similar to t-SNE.

== Methods based on proximity matrices ==
A method based on proximity matrices is one where the data is presented to the algorithm in the form of a similarity matrix or a distance matrix. These methods all fall under the broader class of metric multidimensional scaling. The variations tend to be differences in how the proximity data is computed; for example, isomap, locally linear embeddings, maximum variance unfolding, and Sammon mapping (which is not in fact a mapping) are examples of metric multidimensional scaling methods.

<text>A respondent is a person who is called upon to issue a response to a communication made by another. The term is used in legal contexts, in survey methodology, and in psychological conditioning.

== Legal usage ==
In legal usage, this term specifically refers to the defendant in a legal proceeding commenced by a petitioner, and also to an appellee, or the opposing party, in an appeal from a decision by an initial fact-finder or tribunal. For example in a Court of Appeal case, the respondents are the party facing the appellant, who is challenging a lower court decision or some aspect of it. The respondent may have been the &quot;claimant&quot; or the &quot;defendant&quot; in the lower court.

In the United States Senate, the two sides in an impeachment trial are called the management and the respondent.

== Psychology usage ==
In psychology, respondent conditioning is a synonym for classical conditioning or Pavlovian conditioning. Respondent behavior specifically refers to the behavior consistently elicited by a reflexive or classically conditioned stimulus.

== Survey usage ==
In population survey and questionnaire pretesting, a respondent is a research participant replying with answers or feedback to a survey. Depending on the survey questions and context, respondent answers may represent themselves as individuals, a household or organization of which they are a part, or as a proxy to another individual.

<text>The Federico Santa María Technical University (, UTFSM, or simply Santa Maria University) is a Chilean university member of the Rector&#x27;s Council, founded in 1931 in Valparaíso, Chile.

The university has campuses in Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Santiago (Vitacura and San Joaquín), Concepcion, as well as in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The Federico Santa María Technical University is the alma mater of several prominent businessmen, engineers and Chilean scientists. Its students and alumni are known as &quot;Sansanos&quot;.

The UTFSM was the first Chilean university to confer a doctorate in engineering in 1962 and the first higher-education institution in Latin America to confer this degree. The UTFSM university radio is the oldest campus radio in Latin America.

The university admission is very competitive and, it is known for its rigorous study requirements, demanding study program. For the years 2011–2016, the UTFSM has an undergraduate retention rate of 82% by the first year of studies, and a 66% by the second year. Less than 1% of its students are international, and most of the available courses are imparted in Spanish.

The graduation date is held on 20 December every year, since it commemorates the anniversary of the death of the founder, Federico Santa Maria Carrera, on 20 December 1925.

== History ==

The university takes its name from Federico Santa María, a Chilean philanthropist that lived in France. He raised a huge fortune as a broker in the sugar market in Paris. Before his death, he donated all his fortune to create a university in Valparaíso, his hometown. Although the exact amount of his fortune is unknown, it is believed to have been around 27 billion dollars of today&#x27;s currency. While in Paris in 1920, in his testament, Santa María donated his fortune with the idea of building a high-standard technical and scientific institution.

In his will, Santa María manifested that his desired executors contribute to material progress and expand Chile&#x27;s cultural horizons; altruistic ideas which sought to facilitate entry into the academic life of outstanding compatriots dispossessed but without further requirement than merit, skills and high academic achievement. This institution would accept and prepare the best students from all socioeconomic backgrounds to gain technical and scientific knowledge that contribute to the progress of the country.

The executors were chosen by Santa María to be Agustin Edwards Mac-Clure, Juan Brown Caces, Carlos van Buren and Andrew Geddes.

Following his philosophy, on March 31, 1926, an institution was created to develop Santa María&#x27;s legacy. In 1931, the School of Crafts and Arts and School of Engineering José Miguel Carrera was founded. In 1935, its name changed to Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María.

The condition imposed by Federico Santa María was that, during the first 10 years, the university must receive academics from the best schools of sciences and engineering. Following this imperative, the executor of this project, Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure, traveled to Germany where he contacted Karl Laudien, at the time rector of a technical school in the Western Pemerania region, and he became the first rector of the university. From that moment, the university received a strong German influence in its engineering education. Several German engineers and scientists arrived before and after the second world war from institutions such as TU Berlin, Berlin University, and Leipzig University among other German institutions. They brought to the university cutting edge knowledge in physics, chemistry and engineering. For example, Arnold Keller, professor of the Physics department at UTFSM, was involved in the development of the V-1 rockets during the second world war, as part of the team of Wernher von Braun. Research in new areas to the country such as Solar Energy, or Chemistry of Natural Products were created, which delivered two Nacional Science Prize awards, Herbert Appel in 1970, and Juan Garbarino in 1998.

In 1934, the Scientia magazine is published, becoming the voice for the university&#x27;s academic work.

In 1937, the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria Radio was created, becoming the first university radio broadcaster in Chile and Latin America, focused to broadcasting information and cultural programs. The radio still broadcasts to this day, in the AM: 1.450 and FM: 99,7 signals in the Valparaiso region. The radio also has an online signal.

In 1939, the Alumni association was founded, known today as AEXA (Asociación de Ex-Alumnos).

In 1960, the Graduate School was created, and its first director was Herbert Appel (1960-1964), offering the PhD study lines for chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. In 1963 the university became the first higher-education institution in Latin America to confer a doctorate in engineering, in cooperation with the University of Pittsburgh. In the 1960s the university started a strategy of national and international expansion. In 1966 the Technical campus &quot;Viña del Mar&quot; was founded. In 1972 the campus &quot;Rey Balduino de Bélgica&quot; in the southeast city of Concepción with orientation in technical-professional areas was founded. The project received strong financial support from Baudouin King.

In 1964, the university grants for the first time a technical degree to a woman, the chemical technician Patricia Guzman. In 1965 Graciela Muñoz graduates as its first female engineer.

The UTFSM was the first university of the 8 existing universities in Chile at the time to restart its operations on 15 October 1973, after the Military coup of 11 September 1973.

==Campuses==
The university has three campuses and two branch campuses (&quot;sedes&quot;):

#Casa Central, main campus. Inaugurated in 1931 in Valparaíso
#Campus Vitacura, Inaugurated in 1995 in Vitacura, Santiago, Chile. 
#Campus San Joaquín. Inaugurated in 2009 in San Joaquin, Santiago, Chile.
#Sede José Miguel Carrera, located in Viña del Mar.
#Sede Rey Balduino de Bélgica, Inaugurated in 1972 in Talcahuano, Chile.

While the campuses are focused on undergraduate, graduate and university academical activities, &quot;sedes&quot; are mainly dedicated to technical degrees.

Additionally the UTFSM started in 1996 a Campus located in Guayaquil, Ecuador, from an agreement with the Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manta, campus which closed in 2018, with the infrastructure being taken over by a newly created university, Universidad del Rio. Around 600 students in 2019 expect to be graduated by 2023, process which will lead to the definitive closure of UTFSM Activities in Ecuador.

===Main campus, Valparaíso===
The main UTFSM campus (or &quot;Casa Central&quot;) is located in Valparaíso, covering most of the front area of Los Placeres hill, on the grounds of the former Pudeto fort. The site faces the Pacific coast and it is visible from many parts of the bay of Valparaíso.

The building was designed by Josué Smith Solar, one of the most respected Chilean architects of the 20th century, and his son José Smith Miller. The American Neo-Gothic style campus is considered one of the foremost works of Chilean architecture. The campus is also recognised for its beautiful gardening, with native and exotic species.

In 2001, the illumination of the university frontis was renewed through a contest organised by the Chilean branch of Philips.

The main campus has a gothic scholastic architecture with a privileged view to the Pacific Ocean. This campus includes more than 3 hectares of green areas making it the biggest urban park in Valparaiso, despite it being closed to the public. In 2008 it was chosen as one of the most remarkable national architectural works of the 20th century.

=== Branch campus Viña del Mar, &quot;José Miguel Carrera&quot; ===
In the 1960s, the university formulated an expansion plan. With financial assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the support of the Ford Foundation, advice from Dunwoody Industrial Institute in the US, and a donation of land by Chile&#x27;s Agricultural Development Institute INDAP (from the Spanish &quot;Instituto de Desarrollo Agropecuario&quot;), a fully furnished building was constructed in 1971 in Viña del Mar, and it was named the &quot;Jose Miguel Carrera&quot; branch campus, following the testamentary vision of the university founder, the philanthropist Federico Santa María.

This branch is located on the border between the communes of Vina del Mar and Quilpué in Chile.

=== Branch campus Concepción, &quot;Rey Baduino de Belgica&quot; ===
By the mid-1960s, the university planned to install six schools in different parts of the country.

In October 1965, the Kings of Belgium, Baudouin I and Fabiola de Mora y Aragon visited the university headquarters in Valparaíso, were introduced to its educational project and as a result initiated conversations for the construction of a branch campus in the city of Concepción.

Meanwhile, our country strengthens their contributions: the government facilitates the exchange of funds provided by Belgium; local businesses such as the San Pedro Sawmills, Cementos Bio Bio, Pacific Steel Company, Fanaloza, Inchalam, Pizarreño, Glasses Lirquén, among others, also contributed in its construction. Additionally, a donation of Archbishop of Concepción provided the land needed for the building construction. Its construction began in 1969.

Academic activities started on April 26, 1971, offering the careers of Electronics, Electrical, Structural Mechanics, Maintenance Mechanics, and Chemistry. On February 14, 1972, the campus branch was inaugurated solemnly in the presence of the President of Chile, Salvador Allende Gossens, and the university rector, Jaime Chiang Acosta.

== Academic rankings and accreditation ==
The UTFSM has been historically perceived as one of the most prestigious engineering schools in the country and more recently, with the appearance of national and international rankings, has been placed among the top Universities in Chile and Latin America. The UTFSM has consistently been considered as one of the best engineering universities in Latin America, and appears regularly as a highly ranked university in many of the published world university rankings.

* For 10 consecutive years, UTFSM has been ranked among the three best Universities in Chile in terms of quality perception given by more than 1000 important national business executives. 
* In 2012, the university was ranked 5 between 9,500 schools of engineering in the world according to their impact factor in the last 5 years (Microsoft Academics), as the latinoamerican university with the largest normalized impact factor, and as the first school of engineering in South America. 
* According to Times Higher Education Ranking UTFSM has been decreasing its ranking from being among the 251-275 best Universities in the World in 2015, to being between the 1201-1500 best universities. Its THE ranking for the UTFSM in Latin America has decreased from #13 in 2016, to #49 in 2022.
* In 2019, the UTFSM was ranked 2nd in Latin America in the Times Higher Education (THE) world ranking for Engineering and Technology.
* US News has ranked the UTFSM as #64 in the Best Global Universities ranking, #15 in the Best Universities in Latin America ranking, and #3 in the Best Universities in Chile ranking.
=== Accreditations ===

* Chilean National Accreditation commission CNA: 6 years until December 2022

==Organization==

=== Directive council ===
The current president of the UTFSM Academic Council is Mr. Roberto Medina Cantariño. The following table summarizes the different presidents the UTFSM has had in its history.
=== Rector ===
The current rector is Professor Juan I. Yuz Eissmann, professor of electronic engineering at UTFSM was ratified as the new rector of the university for the period 2022–2026. Some notable events:
* Two rectors died at the time of having the role, i.e., Armando Quezada in 1936, and Commander Juan Naylor in 1977. They were replaced by Interim Rectors until a new rector was chosen through a vote.
* One rector have had to resign due to protests within the university,i.e., Carlos Cerutti in 1968.
* Three &quot;delegate&quot; rectors were designated by a military junta. During the Military regime of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990) the university rector was designated by the military junta instead of a normal voting process. Three &quot;delegate rectors&quot;, retired military men, had this role during the period: Commander Juan Naylor (1973-1977), Vice-admiral Ismael Huerta (1977-1985) and Commander Arturo Niño de Zepeda (1985-1989).
* Two of the rectors were siblings, i.e., Jaime Chiang Acosta (1968-1972), and Gustavo Chiang Acosta (1989-1993).
* Jaime Chiang Acosta (1969-1972) was the first rector chosen through a voting process in the university community.
* Jaime Chiang Acosta (1969-1972) was the first rector that was also a UTFSM alumnus, a Civil Chemical Engineering graduate (1952) with a PhD from the University of Louisiana.
* Gustavo Chiang Acosta (1989-1993), a UTFSM civil mechanical engineer graduated in 1949, was also the first rector chosen by popular vote of the university community after the end of the Pinochet military regime.
* A candidate for rector needs to obtain at least 60% of the votes in an election from the Full Board (Claustro Pleno, constituted of all academics at the university) to be elected directly, otherwise the decision remains with the Directive Board. This mechanism has been used in several elections, but the board usually confirms the voting mayority, such as in the case of Jose Rodriguez vs. Raul Steigmeyer in 2010, and in the case of Darcy Fuenzalida vs. Marcello Visconti in 2014. 
* During the election for rector in 1993, a tight election between Manfred Max-Neef and Adolfo Arata gave the former a 1-vote victory in the first election round, and a 2-vote victory during the second round. In this case the Directive Board chose to award the election to Adolfo Arata.

=== Academic departments ===
Due to the focused nature of the university, its organisation currently does not include different faculties, only different academic departments, which carry out research and graduate/undergraduate educational programs. Originally, faculties had been considered in the university organization, with the founding of the first three faculties in 1944, Chemical, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Faculties were subsequently abolished under Adolfo Arata&#x27;s period as rector.

Within the Chilean campus level, there are 17 different academic departments, though not all of them are in every campus location, and not all degree levels are offered at every location, as the following table shows:

UTFSM is the only Chilean engineering school where sports is an obligatory course in the curriculum during the first three semesters of all its study lines at its Valparaiso and Santiago Campuses.

The university offers careers of Commercial Pilot and Aeronautical Engineering in its Academia de Ciencias Aeronáuticas in a joint venture with Chilean airline Lan Chile.

==Education==

The university offers undergraduate and graduate degrees. The undergraduate degrees can be of 12 academic semesters (civil engineering), 10 semesters (engineering, pure sciences and architecture), 8 semesters (Applied Engineering) and 6 semesters (technical careers).

The Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering has 12 associate professors, 11 with PhD degrees (92%). The department offers the graduate programs of Master of Science and PhD in chemical engineering.

=== Mechanical Engineering ===

The Mechanical Engineering School at UTFSM was founded together with the foundation of the School of Engineers in 1935, being one of the oldest degrees offered by the university. Its first four mechanical engineers graduated in 1939. The mechanical engineering department was also among the first to offer a PhD program in 1964 (along with Chemical and Electrical Engineering Departments).

The mechanical engineering department has the following research areas:
* Thermodynamics
* Energy and Renewable energies
* Process engineering
The department has 20 full-time professors (2016 data), 17 with PhD degrees (85%). Additional to the Bachelor of Sciences in mechanical engineering (BSc.), the department offers the graduate programs of Master of Science (BSc.) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in mechanical engineering. The department has also made substantive efforts to connect with its alumni. A comprehensive list of the graduates of the department can be found online.

=== Graduate school ===
The UTFSM graduate school started its activities on the 1 August 1960, as a response to the increasing requirements for deeper and applied research in the country. The project was directed by Leroy Stutzman of the University of Pittsburgh, and doctors G.R. Fitterer and John F. Calver, who audited study programs and teaching methods for the project. The first director of the UTFSM graduate school was Herbert Appel, during the period 1960–1964. The school initially offered PhD study lines in chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. The first UTFSM PhD graduate was Walter Gaete Castro, with a PhD degree in chemical engineering, becoming the first PhD graduate in Latin America.

=== Doctor Honoris Causa ===
The &quot;Doctor Honoris Causa&quot; honorary degree is the highest distinction that UTFSM can bestow. Only seven people had been awarded this honor by UTFSM until 2022, when the university conferred the degree to alumna Lorena A. Barba. Previously, it was awarded to:

* Georges Mikenberg in 2019, physicist, for his work in particle physics and support of the UTFSM participation in CERN research programs.
*Raul Zurita in 2015, and first UTFSM alumnus to obtain it, for his successful career in literature

Since 2010 UTFSM has been awarded with nearly US$8 million for 76 research projects. Many of these projects involve national and international collaborations with prestigious institutions in Latin America (ANDES Laboratory Project, RIABIN Biotechnology Network), Europe (CERN, Max Planck Institut, Politecnico di Milano), and USA (MIT, SLAC), among others.

== Cultural activities ==

=== University radio ===
The Federico Santa Maria University radio was created on the 7 April 1937, and it is the oldest university radio in Latin America. It can be heard on 1450 kHz in the AM spectrum, on 99.7 MHz in the FM spectrum, and online.

=== University Chamber Choir ===
The Chamber Choir of the Federico Santa María Technical University was founded on August 4, 1951, in its Valparaiso Campus. It is the second oldest choir in Chile with continuous activity. During the choir&#x27;s over 60 years of existence, it has interpreted an extensive repertoire, including all manifestations of choral western music, from the Middle Ages to the present day. The choir&#x27;s first performance was at the closing ceremony of the academic year in December 1951, in the Aula Magna, main hall of events in the &quot;A&quot; building of the university&#x27;s Main Valparaíso campus.

Demosthenes Penna, engineering student of this campus, was its founder and first director until 1954. From March 1955, the choir was directed by Silvio Olate Valenzuela for over 28 years until March 1983. From 1983 to 1987, it was directed by Mauricio Pergelier Hernandez. For the next 23 years, from 1987 to 2010, the choir was conducted by Eduardo Silva Cerda. From 2010, the choir has been conducted by Felipe Molina Lavandera.

The Guayaquil campus in Ecuador also has formed a Choir in 2015, directed by Charles Sampertegui.

=== Folklore ensemble &quot;Alimapu&quot; ===
The university has a long history of musical expression, in particular through its folkloric ensemble &quot;Alimapu&quot;

== Alumni ==
Different organizations, denominated AEXA (from the Spanish &quot;Asociacion de EX Alumnos&quot;) have been created at several of the UTFSM campuses:
* AEXA Valparaiso, established in 1939
* AEXA Santiago, established in 1941
* AEXA in the United States, established in 1995

These organization are created and managed by the alumni themselves, and coordinate their action with the university through the UTFSM Alumni Network office.

==Early life==

Amalrik was born in Moscow, during the time of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s purges.

When the Soviet revolution broke out, Andrei&#x27;s father, then a young man, volunteered for the Red Army. After the war he went into the film industry. Andrei&#x27;s father fought in World War II in the Northern Fleet and then the Red Army. He was overheard uttering negative views about Stalin&#x27;s qualities as a military leader, which led to his arrest and imprisonment; he feared for his life, but shortly afterward was released to rejoin the army. In 1942 he was wounded at Stalingrad and invalided out of the service. Andrei&#x27;s father&#x27;s hardships explain Andrei&#x27;s decision to become a historian. For his father, after climbing the educational ladder, was after the war refused permission to study at the Academy of Sciences&#x27; Institute of History on account of what authorities felt was his own compromised political past. But as historian John Keep wrote: &quot;Andrei has gone one better by not only writing history but by securing a place in it.&quot;

Andrei&#x27;s father developed a serious heart condition which required constant nursing. This care was provided first by his wife, and on her death from cancer in 1959 by his son Andrei, until Andrei&#x27;s arrest prevented him from ministering to his father&#x27;s needs. He died when Andrei was in prison.

In high school, Andrei Amalrik was a restless student and truant. He was expelled a year before graduation. Despite this, he won admission to the history department at Moscow State University in 1959.

In 1963, he angered the university with a dissertation suggesting that Scandinavian warrior-traders (Vikings, usually called Varangians in Russia) and Greeks, rather than Slavs, played the principal role in developing the early Russian state in the ninth century. Amalrik refused to modify his views and was expelled from Moscow University.

==First prison sentence==
Without a degree, Amalrik did odd jobs and wrote five unpublished plays but was soon under the gaze of the security police for an attempt to contact a Danish scholar through the Danish Embassy. He also became close to the unofficial youth literary group SMOG. Amalrik&#x27;s plays and an interest in modern non-representational art led to Amalrik&#x27;s first arrest in May 1965. A charge of spreading pornography failed because the expert witnesses called by the prosecution refused to give the needed testimony. However, the authorities then accused Amalrik of &quot;parasitism,&quot; and he was sentenced by an administrative tribunal to banishment in western Siberia for a two-and-a-half-year term.

He was freed briefly and then rearrested and sent to exile in a farm village near Tomsk, in Siberia. Allowed to make a brief trip to Moscow after the death of his father, Amalrik persuaded Tatar expressionist artist, Gyuzel Makudinova, to marry him and share his exile.

It was this exile he described in &quot;Involuntary Journey to Siberia&quot; (1970). Thanks to the efforts of his lawyer, his sentence was overturned in 1966 and Amalrik returned to Moscow, moving with Gyuzel into a crowded communal apartment with shared bath, kitchen, and telephone.

==Protest at trial==
During the trial of writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel in February 1966, Amalrik and other dissenters stood outside of the trial to protest.

Amalrik often met with foreign correspondents to relay protests, took part in vigils outside courthouses and even gave an interview to an American television reporter.

In June 1966, after being released early from exile, Amalrik returned to Moscow. He got a job as a freelancer at the Novosti Press Agency. This work allowed him to create a circle of acquaintances among foreign correspondents. He handed over to a foreign correspondent the &quot;Memorandum&quot; of Andrei Sakharov. Amalrik was published abroad. Together with Pavel Litvinov, he wrote the collection &quot;Trial of the Four&quot; about the trial of Alexander Ginzburg, Yuri Galanskov, Alexey Dobrovolsky, and Vera Lashkova. In October 1968, he gave the collection to foreign correspondents, with whom he talked a lot. At the end of 1968, he was fired from Novosti and began working as a postman.

After the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, pressure on Russia&#x27;s intellectuals was stepped up by the authorities. Amalrik&#x27;s apartment was twice searched, in May 1969 and February 1970.

==Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?==

Amalrik was best known in the Western world for his essay &quot;Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?&quot;, published in 1970. The book predicts the country&#x27;s eventual breakup under the weight of social and ethnic antagonisms and a disastrous war with China. This was in direct contrast to Andrei Sakharov&#x27;s famous essay &quot;Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom&quot;, published only two years before, which argued that a convergence between Soviet and western systems was already taking place, while Amalrik&#x27;s essay argued that the two systems were in fact growing further apart.

Writing in 1969, Amalrik originally wanted to make 1980 as the date of the Soviet downfall, because 1980 was a round number, but Amalrik was persuaded by a friend to change it to the Orwellian inspired year of 1984. Amalrik predicted the collapse of the regime would occur between 1980 and 1985.

Amalrik said in his book:

Amalrik was incorrect in some of his predictions, such as a coming military collision with China, and the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred in 1991, not 1984. Correct was his argument that:

Amalrik predicted that when the breakup of the Soviet empire came, it would take one of two forms. Either power would pass to extremist elements and the country would &quot;disintegrate into anarchy, violence, and intense national hatred,&quot; or the end would come peacefully and lead to a federation like the British Commonwealth or the European Common Market.

As 1984 drew nearer, Amalrik revised the timetable 
but still predicted that the Soviet Union would eventually collapse.

===U.S. reaction===
Predictions of the Soviet Union&#x27;s impending demise were discounted by many, if not most, Western academic specialists, and had little impact on mainstream Sovietology. &quot;Amalrik&#x27;s essay was welcomed as a piece of brilliant literature in the West&quot; but &quot;[v]irtually no one tended to take it at face value as a piece of political prediction.&quot;

===Soviet reaction===
Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky described that &quot;in 1984 KGB officials, on coming to me in prison&quot; when Amalrik&#x27;s essay was mentioned, &quot;laughed at this prediction. &#x27;Amalrik is long dead&#x27;, they said, &#x27;but we are still very much present.&#x27;&quot;

===Post-USSR views===
Of those few who foresaw the fall of the Soviet Union, including Andrei Amalrik, author Walter Laqueur argued in 1995 that they were largely accidental prophets, possessors of both brilliant insight into the regime&#x27;s weaknesses and even more brilliant luck.

On an essay published in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, Charles King called Amalrik&#x27;s predictions &quot;deserving of an award&quot;, praising his logical method for exploring the historical outcomes that arise from a nation&#x27;s tendency to bet in its own prolonged stability — &quot;&quot;to consider, for a moment, how some future historian might recast implausible concerns as inevitable ones&quot;.&quot;, as well as his insight into what the post-Soviet geopolitic scenario would look like. King argues that, while Amalrik was wrong about the likelihood of conflict with China, the Soviet–Afghan War played out perfectly as a stand-in for what Amalrik predicted: &quot;a drawn-out, exhausting war, prosecuted by decrepit leaders, which drained the Soviet government of resources and legitimacy&quot;.

==Second prison sentence==
For several months after the publication of &quot;Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?&quot; (1970) and &quot;Involuntary Journey to Siberia&quot; (August 1970), abroad, a criminal offence under Soviet law, Amalrik remained free to walk the streets of Moscow and to associate with foreigners.

Inevitably, for &quot;defaming the Soviet state&quot;, Amalrik was arrested on May 21, 1970 and convicted on November 12, receiving a sentence of three years in a labor camp in Kolyma. At the end of his term, he was given three more years, but because of his poor health (he almost died of meningitis) and protests from the West, the sentence was commuted after one year to exile in the same region. After serving a five-year term, he returned to Moscow in 1975. Although the Amalriks were not Jewish, the authorities tried to persuade him and his wife to apply for visas to Israel, the common channel for emigration from the Soviet Union; they refused. On September 13, 1975, Amalrik was arrested again. The police captain told his wife that he was arrested for not having permission to live in Moscow; he could have faced a fine or up to one year in prison for violating Soviet passport regulations.

In early 1976, Amalrik and other dissidents conceived the idea of the Moscow Helsinki Group; it was formed in May 1976.

==Exile==

The KGB gave Amalrik an ultimatum: to emigrate or face another sentence. In 1976 his family got visas to go to the Netherlands. He made a farewell tour of Russia before emigrating.

Amalrik worked in the Netherlands at the Utrecht University, then moved to the United States to study and lecture. Later, he and Gyuzel bought a villa in France, near the Swiss border, where he worked on his book, &quot;Notebooks of a Revolutionary.&quot;

He scorned détente with the Soviet Union. He urged that Western trade and technology be linked to liberalization within the Soviet Union.

==Death==
On November 12, 1980, Amalrik, his wife, and two other Soviet exiles, Vladimir Borisov and Viktor Fainberg, were on their way to Madrid to attend an East-West conference called to review the Helsinki Accords of 1975. &quot;Spanish police stated that Amalrik, coming from southern France, swerved out of his lane on a wet road near the city of Guadalajara and his car struck an oncoming truck. Mr. Amalrik was instantly killed by a piece of metal, probably from the steering column, which was embedded in his throat, according to the police. His widow, Gyuzel, received only slight injuries,&quot; as did the two other passengers.

==Quotes==
*In Russian history, man has always been a means but never an end

===Quotes from &quot;Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?&quot;===
*&quot;There is another powerful factor which works against the chance of any kind of peaceful reconstruction and which is equally negative for all levels of society: this is the extreme isolation in which the regime has placed both society and itself. This isolation has not only separated the regime from society, and all sectors of society from each other, but also put the country in extreme isolation from the rest of the world. This isolation has created for all—from the bureaucratic elite to the lowest social levels—an almost surrealistic picture of the world and of their place in it. Yet the longer this state of affairs helps to perpetuate the status quo, the more rapid and decisive will be its collapse when confrontation with reality becomes inevitable.&quot;
*&quot;...any state forced to devote so much of its energies to physically and psychologically controlling millions of its own subjects could not survive indefinitely.&quot;

===Quote from &quot;Notes of a Revolutionary&quot;===
*&quot;We had left a great country that we both loved and hated. Could it really be that we would never return?&quot;
*&quot;Even when examining the subject most critically, I do not regard the Russians as a hopeless people, for whom slavery is a natural mode of existence. ... I can see that in the authoritarian stream of Russian history there is an undercurrent, sometimes strong, of a sense of law.&quot;

Before being exiled, Amalrik made a pilgrimage to those places where, in the 14th century, Muscovy was born. Standing before an amazing complex of wooden churches of Kizhi Pogost on the banks of Lake Onega, he felt a stab of wonderment: &quot;How could one and the same people have created such churches and destroyed so many of them in blind rage?&quot;

<doc id="309285" wikidata="Q5004121" url="?curid=309285" title="Bylaugh Hall">
<text>Bylaugh Hall, also known as Bylaugh Park, is a country house situated in the parish of Bylaugh in Norfolk, England.

==History==
The estate was acquired by Sir John Lombe Bt (c. 1731–1817) in 1796. His fortune came from his family&#x27;s silk throwing mill in Derbyshire; the details are uncertain. The unsubstantiated traditional story is that he won it from the former owner, Richard Lloyd, in a card game, after Lloyd&#x27;s butler drugged his wine, but a more prosaic explanation seems likely.

Sir John did not marry and therefore had no legal immediate heirs. The terms of his will were complex. He left his estates to Edward Beevor (1771–1847), a barrister who was his half-brother (the product of an affair with a Norwich doctor&#x27;s wife) who assumed the name of Lombe on his inheritance. Sir John ordered in his will that a new mansion was to be built on his Bylaugh estate, but Edward was reluctant to do this, and the terms of this will were not fulfilled until about 30 years later when his son, also called Edward Beevor, (1800–1852) inherited the property in 1847.

==The Beevor family==
Edward Beevor, who built Bylaugh Hall, also assumed the name of Lombe. He was born in 1800 in Norwich. In 1826 he became an MP for Arundel. In 1831 he married Marie Rozer de St. Julien, who was French. The couple had no children and spent most of their lives travelling abroad. In 1849, after a long delay, the Court of Chancery intervened, and ordered the use of the trust funds for their appointed purpose, and the architects Charles Barry, Jr. and Robert Richardson Banks were at length commissioned to design a suitable house. William Andrews Nesfield advised on the position of the house, and was responsible for laying out the grounds and gardens. The clock tower and surrounding buildings are vaguely reminiscent of the new Houses of Parliament which were designed by Sir Charles Barry, Sr. Along with the Houses of Parliament, it was amongst the first buildings ever to employ steel girders in the supporting structure. The exterior stonework, including the balustrades and the terrace walling, are of Magnesian Limestone. At that time the estate was the third largest in Norfolk, containing over 19,000 acres (77 km2).

Bylaugh Hall was completed in 1852, but Edward had died in the same year in Florence before its completion. It was inherited by his uncle Charles Beevor (1776–1860) who assumed the name of Lombe in accordance with Sir John Lombe&#x27;s will. He was the first resident of Bylaugh Hall.

Charles died in 1860 and was succeeded by Rev. Edward Evans (1791–1861) who was a legitimate descendant of the Lombe family.

==The Evans-Lombe family==

On inheriting the estate, the Rev. Edward Evans took the extra name Lombe, making his surname Evans-Lombe; but he only lived for a year, and his younger brother Rev. Henry Evans then inherited in turn. He also added Lombe to his name in 1862.

Rev Henry Evans-Lombe (1792–1878) was born in 1792 in Kirby Bedon. His father was Thomas Browne Evans (1767–1827) and his mother was Mary Hase who was the niece of Sir John Lombe. He was educated at Cambridge University and became a clergyman. In 1818 he married Sophia Cubitt, daughter of Thomas Cubitt of Honing Hall, Norfolk. The 1871 Census shows Henry and Sophia living at Bylaugh Hall with some of their family. There were also fifteen servants living in the Hall: a butler, two footmen, a housekeeper, a lady&#x27;s maid, three housemaids, a scullery maid, a general domestic servant, a coachman, two grooms and two gardeners.
He died in 1878 and his son Rev. Henry Evans-Lombe (1819–1897) inherited the Hall. He was born in 1819 in Norfolk. In 1849 he married his cousin Louisa Brown Evans. The couple had five children. He lived in the Hall with his family for almost twenty years and is listed in both the 1881 and 1891 censuses with a very large number of servants. He died in 1897 and his son Major Edward Henry Evans-Lombe inherited the house. He did not live in the house but instead rented it to William Knox D&#x27;Arcy, a wealthy mining magnate, from 1899 until 1917 when D&#x27;Arcy died.

Major Edward Henry Evans-Lombe (1861-1952) was born in 1861 in Suffolk. He was also educated at Cambridge University, and joined the military forces in the Prince of Wales&#x27; Own Norfolk Artillery Militia. He also managed his father&#x27;s estate at Great Melton Hall. In 1886 he married Albinia Harriet Leslie-Melville, daughter of Alexander Samuel Leslie-Melville of Branston Hall, Lincoln. The couple had two daughters who were frequently mentioned in the social pages. The eldest daughter Albinia Mary Evans-Lombe was married in 1911 and a photo is shown of the couple.

In 1917 Major Edward Henry Evans-Lombe sold Bylaugh Hall and the 8,150 acre estate to speculators who promptly broke it up into lots and put it back on the market with estate agents John D Wood. The Hall and 736 acres of parkland were bought by the Marsh family.

==The Marsh family==
The Marsh family, who were Americans, owned Bylaugh Hall until 1947. Henry Wheelwright Marsh (1860–1943) seems to have bought the Hall in 1917. He was one of the founders of the insurance brokerage firm Marsh and McLennan, with headquarters in Chicago and New York. In 1904 he married Agnes Elizabeth Power (1876–1947) who came from Boston, Massachusetts. The couple had no children but they loved to entertain. They made their home in England, while Henry &#x27;commuted&#x27; to the US by steamer. Before settling at Bylaugh he had leased many notable historical buildings. These included Medmenham Abbey, Knebworth House and Warwick Castle. While they still held the lease on Warwick Castle, it seems that they decided to buy their own property, and so purchased Bylaugh Hall. They continued to entertain at Warwick Castle after their purchase, and a photo of Mrs Agnes Marsh with two members of Russian royalty at one of their house parties is shown. They were separated in 1926 and Agnes made her home at Bylaugh.

Other members of Agnes&#x27; family also came to live at Bylaugh Hall for extended visits. In 1922 her sister Alice Anne Rice and her brother-in-law David Rice became residents. At the same time her sister Genevieve &quot;Viva&quot; Power (1885–1964), who had married Dr (later Sir) Russell Wilkinson (1888–1969), moved into the Hall. A notice appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1923 advertising for a nursery governess for Mrs Russell Wilkinson&#x27;s two young children Derek and Diana Wilkinson at Bylaugh Hall. Agnes&#x27; sister Alice died at the Hall in 1935.

During World War II the Hall was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force. Agnes Marsh moved into the &quot;Butler&#x27;s Cottage&quot; for the duration. The 100 Group (Bomber Support) moved there in 1944, and an account of their activities is given in &quot;100 Group (Bomber Support): RAF Bomber Command in World War II&quot; by Martin W. Bowman.

Henry Wheelwright Marsh died in 1943 at the age of 86. Agnes Marsh died in 1947 at Butler’s Cottage, Bylaugh.

==Later history==
In 1948 the house was sold to a new owner who unsuccessfully tried to turn it into a nursing home. By 1950, it was in disrepair, and in June of that year a 350 lot demolition sale was held which stripped the house of its lead roof and interior fittings, leaving it an abandoned ruin.

In 1999 the house (and a lodge) was sold to a local sculptor who dreamt of fully restoring it to its former glory.

By July 2009 the house and outbuildings were the subject of ongoing financial and legal problems that resulted in their complete repossession and the apparent loss of deposits by a number of people.

In February 2013 the banks by now in possession put the unfinished house up for sale.

==Present use==
In March 2014 the house and outbuildings were purchased by Ben Budworth, owner of &quot;The Lady Magazine&quot; published in London.

<text>The Invasion of Poland, also known as the September Campaign, Polish Campaign, and Polish Defensive War of 1939 (1 September – 6 October 1939), was a joint attack on the Republic of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Slovak Republic, and the Soviet Union, which marked the beginning of World War II. The German invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, and one day after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union had approved the pact. One of the aims of the invasion was to divide Polish territory at the end of the operation; Poland was to cease to exist as a country and all Poles (&quot;inferior people&quot;) were to be exterminated. The Soviets invaded Poland on 17 September. The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty. The invasion is also known in Poland as the September campaign () or 1939 defensive war () and known in Germany as the Poland campaign ().

German forces invaded Poland from the north, south, and west the morning after the Gleiwitz incident. Slovak military forces advanced alongside the Germans in northern Slovakia. As the Wehrmacht advanced, Polish forces withdrew from their forward bases of operation close to the Germany–Poland border to more established defense lines to the east. After the mid-September Polish defeat in the Battle of the Bzura, the Germans gained an undisputed advantage. Polish forces then withdrew to the southeast where they prepared for a long defence of the Romanian Bridgehead and awaited expected support and relief from France and the United Kingdom. On 3 September, based on their alliance agreements with Poland, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany; in the end their aid to Poland was very limited. France invaded a small part of Germany in the Saar Offensive, and the Polish army was effectively defeated even before the British Expeditionary Force could be transported to Europe, with the bulk of the BEF in France by the end of September.

On 17 September, the Soviet Red Army invaded Eastern Poland, the territory beyond the Curzon Line that fell into the Soviet &quot;sphere of influence&quot; according to the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact; this rendered the Polish plan of defence obsolete. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all troops to neutral Romania. On 6 October, following the Polish defeat at the Battle of Kock, German and Soviet forces gained full control over Poland. The success of the invasion marked the end of the Second Polish Republic, though Poland never formally surrendered.

On 8 October, after an initial period of military administration, Germany directly annexed western Poland and the former Free City of Danzig and placed the remaining block of territory under the administration of the newly established General Government. The Soviet Union incorporated its newly acquired areas into its constituent Byelorussian and Ukrainian republics, and immediately started a campaign of Sovietization. In the aftermath of the invasion, a collective of underground resistance organizations formed the Polish Underground State within the territory of the former Polish state. Many of the military exiles who escaped Poland joined the Polish Armed Forces in the West, an armed force loyal to the Polish government-in-exile.

== Background ==
On 30 January 1933, the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party, under its leader Adolf Hitler, came to power in Germany. While some dissident elements within the Weimar Republic had long sought to annex territories belonging to Poland, it was Hitler&#x27;s own idea and not a realization of any pre-1933 Weimar plans to invade and partition Poland, annex Bohemia and Austria, and create satellite or puppet states economically subordinate to Germany. As part of this long-term policy, Hitler at first pursued a policy of rapprochement with Poland, trying to improve opinion in Germany, culminating in the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934. Earlier, Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy worked to weaken ties between Poland and France and attempted to manoeuvre Poland into the Anti-Comintern Pact, forming a cooperative front against the Soviet Union. Poland would be granted territory to its northeast in Ukraine and Belarus if it agreed to wage war against the Soviet Union, but the concessions the Poles were expected to make meant that their homeland would become largely dependent on Germany, functioning as little more than a client state. The Poles feared that their independence would eventually be threatened altogether; historically Hitler had already denounced the right of Poland to independence in 1930, writing that Poles and Czechs were a &quot;rabble not worth a penny more than the inhabitants of Sudan or India. How can they demand the rights of independent states?&quot;

The population of the Free City of Danzig was strongly in favour of annexation by Germany, as were many of the ethnic German inhabitants of the Polish territory that separated the German exclave of East Prussia from the rest of the Reich. The Polish Corridor constituted land long disputed by Poland and Germany, and was inhabited by a Polish majority. The Corridor had become a part of Poland after the Treaty of Versailles. Many Germans also wanted the urban port city of Danzig and its environs (comprising the Free City of Danzig) to be reincorporated into Germany. Danzig city had a German majority, and had been separated from Germany after Versailles and made into the nominally independent Free City. Hitler sought to use this as &quot;casus belli&quot;, a reason for war, reverse the post-1918 territorial losses, and on many occasions had appealed to German nationalism, promising to &quot;liberate&quot; the German minority still in the Corridor, as well as Danzig.
The invasion was referred to by Germany as the 1939 Defensive War (&quot;Verteidigungskrieg&quot;) since Hitler proclaimed that Poland had attacked Germany and that &quot;Germans in Poland are persecuted with a bloody terror and are driven from their homes. The series of border violations, which are unbearable to a great power, prove that the Poles no longer are willing to respect the German frontier.&quot;

Poland participated with Germany in the partition of Czechoslovakia that followed the Munich Agreement, although they were not part of the agreement. It coerced Czechoslovakia to surrender the region of Český Těšín by issuing an ultimatum to that effect on 30 September 1938, which was accepted by Czechoslovakia on 1 October. This region had a Polish majority and had been disputed between Czechoslovakia and Poland in the aftermath of World War I. The Polish annexation of Slovak territory (several villages in the regions of Čadca, Orava and Spiš) later served as the justification for the Slovak state to join the German invasion.

By 1937, Germany began to increase its demands for Danzig, while proposing that an extraterritorial roadway, part of the Reichsautobahn system, be built in order to connect East Prussia with Germany proper, running through the Polish Corridor. Poland rejected this proposal, fearing that after accepting these demands, it would become increasingly subject to the will of Germany and eventually lose its independence as the Czechs had. Polish leaders also distrusted Hitler. The British were also wary of Germany&#x27;s increasing strength and assertiveness threatening its balance of power strategy. On 31 March 1939, Poland formed a military alliance with the United Kingdom and with France, believing that Polish independence and territorial integrity would be defended with their support if it were to be threatened by Germany. On the other hand, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, still hoped to strike a deal with Hitler regarding Danzig (and possibly the Polish Corridor). Chamberlain and his supporters believed war could be avoided and hoped Germany would agree to leave the rest of Poland alone. German hegemony over Central Europe was also at stake. In private, Hitler said in May that Danzig was not the important issue to him, but the creation of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; for Germany.

=== Breakdown of talks ===
With tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy. On 28 April 1939, Hitler unilaterally withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935. Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down, and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible &quot;solution of the Polish problem by military means&quot; through the Case White scenario.

In May, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:

On 22 August, just over a week before the onset of war, Hitler delivered a speech to his military commanders at the Obersalzberg:

With the surprise signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August, the result of secret Nazi–Soviet talks held in Moscow, Germany neutralized the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and war became imminent. In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two spheres of influence; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.

The German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 4:00 a.m. on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the Polish-British Common Defence Pact was signed as an annex to the Franco-Polish alliance. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions—not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion &quot;in mid-leap&quot;.

However, there was one exception: during the night of 25–26 August, a German sabotage group, which had not received orders to suspend action, attacked the Jablunkov Pass and Mosty railway station in Silesia. On the morning of 26 August, the group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident &quot;caused by an insane individual&quot;.

On 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; forces would be made available to Britain&#x27;s empire in the future. The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of &quot;territorial guarantees&quot; to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland.

Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and cross-border troop movements signaled to all observers that war was imminent.
On 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler&#x27;s demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the German minority in Poland. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime Germany would draw up a set of proposals. The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed, but, mindful of how Emil Hácha had been forced to sign his country away under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for the immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable ultimatum. On the night of 30/31 August, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop read a 16-point German proposal to ambassador Nevile Henderson. When the ambassador requested a copy of the proposals for transmission to the Polish government, Ribbentrop refused, on the grounds that the requested Polish representative had failed to arrive by midnight. When Polish Ambassador Lipski went to see Ribbentrop later, on 31 August, to indicate that Poland was favorably disposed to negotiations, he announced that he did not have the full power to sign an agreement, and Ribbentrop dismissed him. German radio then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany&#x27;s offer, and that, therefore, negotiations with Poland had come to an end. Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.

On 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Józef Beck ordered military mobilization, but under pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion in the country.

On 30 August, the Polish Navy sent its destroyer flotilla to Britain, executing the Peking Plan. On the same day, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border. During the night of 31 August, the Gleiwitz incident, a false flag attack on the radio station, was staged near the border city of Gleiwitz in Upper Silesia by German units posing as Polish troops, as part of the wider Operation Himmler. On 31 August, Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order). Because of that, many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions. The late mobilization reduced combat capability of the Polish Army by about 1/3.

== Opposing forces ==
=== Germany ===

Germany had a substantial numeric advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military before the conflict. The &quot;Heer&quot; (army) had 3,472 tanks in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the Replacement Army. 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies. Most notably, the Germans had seven &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, using a new operational doctrine. It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be encircled and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (air force) provided both tactical and strategic air power, particularly dive bombers that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; (lightning war). While historian Basil Liddell Hart claimed &quot;Poland was a full demonstration of the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; theory&quot;, some other historians disagree.

Aircraft played a major role in the campaign. Bombers also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through terror bombing and strafing. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; forces consisted of 1,180 fighters, 290 Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly Heinkel He 111s and Dornier Do 17s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft. In total, Germany had close to 4,000 aircraft, most of them modern. A force of 2,315 aircraft was assigned to &quot;Weiss&quot;. Due to its earlier participation in the Spanish Civil War, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was probably the most experienced, best-trained and best-equipped air force in the world in 1939.

=== Poland ===

Emerging in 1918 as an independent country after 123 years of the Partitions of Poland, the Second Polish Republic, when compared with countries such as United Kingdom or Germany, was a relatively indigent and mostly agricultural country. The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by World War I. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created Central Industrial Region. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced. In 1936, a National Defence Fund was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The Polish Army had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.

Experiences in the Polish–Soviet War shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the trench warfare of World War I, the Polish–Soviet War was a conflict in which the cavalry&#x27;s mobility played a decisive role. Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then. In spite of this, Polish cavalry brigades were used as mobile mounted infantry and had some successes against both German infantry and cavalry.

An average Polish infantry division consisted of 16,492 soldiers and was equipped with 326 light and medium machine guns, 132 heavy machine guns, 92 anti-tank rifles and several dozen light, medium, heavy, anti-tank and anti-airplane field artillery. Contrary to the 1,009 cars and trucks and 4,842 horses in the average German infantry division, the average Polish infantry division had 76 cars and trucks and 6,939 horses.

The Polish Air Force (&quot;Lotnictwo Wojskowe&quot;) was at a severe disadvantage against the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; due to inferiority in numbers and the obsolescence of its fighter planes. However, contrary to German propaganda, it was not destroyed on the ground—in fact it was successfully dispersed before the conflict started and not a single one of its combat planes was destroyed on the ground in the first days of the conflict. In the era of fast progress in aviation the Polish Air Force lacked modern fighters, vastly due to the cancellation of many advanced projects, such as the PZL.38 Wilk and a delay in the introduction of a completely new modern Polish fighter PZL.50 Jastrząb. However, its pilots were among the world&#x27;s best trained, as proven a year later in the Battle of Britain, in which the Poles played a notable part.
Overall, the Germans enjoyed numerical and qualitative aircraft superiority. Poland had only about 600 aircraft, of which only PZL.37 Łoś heavy bombers were modern and comparable to their German counterparts. The Polish Air Force had roughly 185 PZL P.11 and some 95 PZL P.7 fighters, 175 PZL.23 &quot;Karaś&quot; Bs, 35 &quot;Karaś&quot; as light bombers. However, for the September Campaign, not all of those aircraft were mobilized. By 1 September, out of about 120 heavy bombers PZL.37s produced, only 36 PZL.37s were deployed, the rest being mostly in training units. All those aircraft were of indigenous Polish design, with the bombers being more modern than the fighters, according to the Ludomił Rayski air force expansion plan, which relied on a strong bomber force. The Polish Air Force consisted of a &#x27;Bomber Brigade&#x27;, &#x27;Pursuit Brigade&#x27; and aircraft assigned to the various ground armies. The Polish fighters were older than their German counterparts; the PZL P.11 fighter—produced in the early 1930s—had a top speed of only , far less than German bombers. To compensate, the pilots relied on its maneuverability and high diving speed.

The Polish Air Force&#x27;s decisions to strengthen its resources came too late, mostly due to budget limitations. As a &quot;last minute&quot; order in the summer of 1939, Poland bought 160 French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters and 111 English airplanes (100 light bombers Fairey Battle, 10 Hurricanes and 1 Supermarine Spitfire; the sale of 150 Spitfires asked by the Polish government was rejected by the Air Ministry). Despite the fact that some of the airplanes had been shipped to Poland (the first transport of purchased aircraft on the ship &quot;Lassel&quot; sailed from Liverpool on 28 August), none of them would take part in combat. In late 1938, the Polish Air Force also ordered 300 advanced PZL.46 Sum light bombers, but due to a delay in starting mass production, none of them were delivered before 1 September. When in the spring of 1939 it turned out that there were problems with the implementation of the new PZL.50 Jastrząb fighter, it was decided to temporarily implement the production of the fighter PZL P 11.G Kobuz. Nevertheless, due to the outbreak of the war, not one of the ordered 90 aircraft of this type were delivered to the army.

The tank force consisted of two armored brigades, four independent tank battalions and some 30 companies of TKS tankettes attached to infantry divisions and cavalry brigades. A standard tank of the Polish Army during the invasion of 1939 was the 7TP light tank. It was the first tank in the world to be equipped with a diesel engine and 360° Gundlach periscope. The 7TP was significantly better armed than its most common opponents, the German &quot;Panzer&quot; I and II, but only 140 tanks were produced between 1935 and the outbreak of the war. Poland had also a few relatively modern imported designs, such as 50 Renault R35 tanks and 38 Vickers E tanks.

The Polish Navy was a small fleet of destroyers, submarines and smaller support vessels. Most Polish surface units followed Operation Peking, leaving Polish ports on 20 August and escaping by way of the North Sea to join with the British Royal Navy. Submarine forces participated in Operation Worek, with the goal of engaging and damaging German shipping in the Baltic Sea, but they had much less success. In addition, many merchant marine ships joined the British merchant fleet and took part in wartime convoys.

=== German plan ===
The September Campaign was devised by General Franz Halder, the chief of the general staff, and directed by General Walther von Brauchitsch the commander in chief of the German ground forces. It called for the start of hostilities before a declaration of war, and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry, far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support, was to be supported by &quot;Panzers&quot; and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the &quot;Schützen&quot; regiments, forerunners of the &quot;panzergrenadiers&quot;) to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on localized parts of the enemy front, eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The prewar &quot;armoured idea&quot;, which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, which was advocated by some generals, including Heinz Guderian, would have had the armour punching holes in the enemy&#x27;s front and ranging deep into rear areas, but the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. That stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German High Command, which mainly restricted the role of armour and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.

Poland&#x27;s terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather co-operated; the country had flat plains, with long frontiers totalling almost . Poland&#x27;s long border with Germany on the west and north, facing East Prussia, extended . It had been lengthened by another on the southern side in the aftermath of the 1938 Munich Agreement. The German incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia and creation of the German puppet state of Slovakia meant that Poland&#x27;s southern flank was also exposed.

Hitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months. They intended to exploit their long border fully with the great enveloping manoeuver of &quot;Fall Weiss&quot;. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:
* A main attack over the western Polish border, which was to be carried out by Army Group South, commanded by Colonel General Gerd von Rundstedt, attacking from German Silesia and from the Moravian and Slovak border. General Johannes Blaskowitz&#x27;s 8th Army was to drive eastward against Łódź. General Wilhelm List&#x27;s 14th Army was to push on toward Kraków and to turn the Poles&#x27; Carpathian flank. General Walter von Reichenau&#x27;s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South&#x27;s armour, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.
* A second route of attack from northern Prussia. Colonel General Fedor von Bock commanded Army Group North, comprising General Georg von Küchler&#x27;s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General Günther von Kluge&#x27;s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the Polish Corridor.
* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South&#x27;s allied Slovak units from Slovakia.
* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations by &quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot; units that had been prepared before the war.

All three assaults were to converge on Warsaw, and the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the Vistula. &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; was initiated on 1 September 1939 and was the first operation of Second World War in Europe.

=== Polish defence plan ===
The Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, shaped the country&#x27;s defence plan, &quot;Plan West&quot;. Poland&#x27;s most valuable natural resources, industry and population were along the western border in Eastern Upper Silesia. Polish policy centred on their protection, especially since many politicians feared that if Poland retreated from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany like the 1938 Munich Agreement and allow Germany to stay in those regions. The fact that none of Poland&#x27;s allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or territorial integrity was another Polish concern. These reasons made the Polish government disregard French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers, such as the Vistula and San Rivers, despite some Polish generals supporting the idea to be a better strategy. The West Plan allowed the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but that was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general counteroffensive with the support of the Western Allies.

In case of a failure to defend most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the Stryj and Dniestr rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the German advance, and the Romanian Bridgehead could be created.

The Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the &quot;West&quot; defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would have to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, also assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were defending the western regions that were judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units and avoiding it from being smashed before the beginning of Franco-British operations in Western Europe. The operation plan had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.

The British and the French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, and Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and the British expected the war to develop into trench warfare, much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of the strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by the Western Allies.

Polish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. That strategy also left supply lines poorly protected. One-third of Poland&#x27;s forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a double envelopment from East Prussia and the west. Another third was concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of Łódź and Warsaw. The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvres, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions, as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.
As the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea. In the event of war, the Polish military leaders realized that the ships that remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, since the Danish straits were well within operating range of the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if it were implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and so evacuated to Great Britain.

Although the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish prewar propaganda emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. That made Polish defeats during the German invasion come as a shock to the civilian population. Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering the troops&#x27; morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult. The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. That led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.

=== German invasion ===
Following several German-staged incidents, such as the Gleiwitz incident, part of Operation Himmler, which German propaganda used as a pretext to claim that German forces were acting in self-defence, one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German pre-dreadnought battleship &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; opened fire on the Polish military transit depot and coastal fort at Westerplatte, in the Free City of Danzig, on the Baltic Sea. However, in many places, German units crossed the Polish border even before that time. Around then, the Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including Wieluń, the first large-scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops, still without a formal declaration of war issued, attacked near the Polish village of Mokra. The Battle of the Border had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked Poland&#x27;s western, southern and northern borders, and German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia, in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units (Field Army &quot;Bernolák&quot;) from the German-allied Slovak Republic, in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital, Warsaw.

France and Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September, but failed to provide any meaningful support. The German-French border saw only a few minor skirmishes, and most German forces, including 85% of armoured forces, were engaged in Poland. Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, the German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and Lwów. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; gained air superiority early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites, causing logistical problems for the Poles. Many Polish Air Force units ran low on supplies, and 98 of their number withdrew into neutral Romania. The Polish initial strength of 400 was reduced to 54 by 14 September and air opposition virtually ceased, with the main Polish air bases destroyed during the first 48 hours of the war.

Germany attacked from three directions on land. Günther von Kluge led 20 divisions that entered the Polish Corridor and met a second force heading to Warsaw from East Prussia. Gerd von Rundstedt&#x27;s 35 divisions attacked southern Poland. By 3 September, when von Kluge in the north had reached the Vistula River, then some from the German border, and Georg von Küchler was approaching the Narew River, Walther von Reichenau&#x27;s armour was already beyond the Warta river. Two days later, his left wing was well to the rear of Łódź and his right wing at the town of Kielce. On 7 September, the defenders of Warsaw had fallen back to a line paralleling the Vistula River, where they rallied against German tank thrusts. The defensive line ran between Płońsk and Pułtusk, respectively north-west and north-east of Warsaw.

The right wing of the Poles had been hammered back from Ciechanów, about north-west of Pułtusk, and was pivoting on Płońsk. At one stage, the Poles were driven from Pułtusk, and the Germans threatened to turn the Polish flank and thrust on to the Vistula and Warsaw. Pułtusk, however, was regained in the face of withering German fire. Many German tanks were captured after a German attack had pierced the line, but the Polish defenders outflanked them. By 8 September, one of Reichenau&#x27;s armoured corps, having advanced during the first week of the campaign, reached the outskirts of Warsaw. Light divisions on Reichenau&#x27;s right were on the Vistula between Warsaw and the town of Sandomierz by 9 September, and List, in the south, was on the San River north and south of the town of Przemyśl. At the same time, Guderian led his 3rd Army tanks across the Narew, attacking the line of the Bug River that had already encircled Warsaw. All of the German armies made progress in fulfilling their parts of the plan. The Polish armies split up into uncoordinated fragments, some of which were retreating while others were launching disjointed attacks on the nearest German columns.

During this invasion, Hitler&#x27;s troops made extensive use of Pervitin, a recently discovered methamphetamine, which enabled the constant movement of the troops, who no longer felt the need to sleep for several days. The drug would later also be used, this time officially distributed, in the invasions of France and the USSR.

Polish forces abandoned the regions of Pomerelia (the Polish Corridor), Greater Poland and Polish Upper Silesia in the first week. The Polish plan for border defence was a dismal failure. The German advance, as a whole, was not slowed. On 10 September, the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły, ordered a general retreat to the south-east, towards the Romanian Bridgehead. Meanwhile, the Germans were tightening their encirclement of the Polish forces west of the Vistula (in the Łódź area and, still farther west, around Poznań) and penetrating deeply into eastern Poland. Warsaw, which had undergone heavy aerial bombardment since the first hours of the war, was attacked on 9 September and was put under siege on 13 September. Around then, advanced German forces also reached Lwów, a major city in eastern Poland, and 1,150 German aircraft bombed Warsaw on 24 September.

The Polish defensive plan called for a strategy of encirclement. It would allow the Germans to advance in between two Polish Army groups in the line between Berlin and Warsaw-Lodz, and Armia Prusy would then move in and repulse the German spearhead, trapping it. For that to happen, Armia Prusy needed to be fully mobilized by 3 September. However, Polish military planners failed to foresee the speed of the German advance and assumed that Armia Prusy would need to be fully mobilized by 16 September.

The largest battle during this campaign, the Battle of Bzura, took place near the Bzura River, west of Warsaw, and lasted from 9 to 19 September. The Polish armies &quot;Poznań&quot; and &quot;Pomorze&quot;, retreating from the border area of the Polish Corridor, attacked the flank of the advancing German 8th Army, but the counterattack failed despite initial success. After the defeat, Poland lost its ability to take the initiative and counterattack on a large scale. The German air power was instrumental during the battle. The offensive of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; broke what remained of the Polish resistance in an &quot;awesome demonstration of air power&quot;. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; quickly destroyed the bridges across the Bzura River. Then, the Polish forces were trapped out in the open and were attacked by wave after wave of &quot;Stukas&quot;, dropping light bombs, which caused huge numbers of casualties. The Polish anti-aircraft batteries ran out of ammunition and retreated to the forests but were then smoked out by the Heinkel He 111 and Dornier Do 17s dropping incendiaries. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; left the army with the task of mopping up survivors. The &quot;Stukageschwaders&quot; alone dropped of bombs during the battle.

By 12 September, all of Poland west of the Vistula had been conquered except for the isolated Warsaw. The Polish government, led by President Ignacy Mościcki, and the high command, led by Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły, left Warsaw in the first days of the campaign and headed southeast, reaching Lublin on 6 September. From there, it moved on 9 September to Kremenez and, on 13 September to Zaleshiki, on the Romanian border. Rydz-Śmigły ordered the Polish forces to retreat in the same direction, behind the Vistula and San Rivers, beginning the preparations for the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead area.

=== Soviet invasion ===

From the beginning, the German government repeatedly asked Molotov whether the Soviet Union would keep to its side of the partition bargain. The Soviet forces were holding fast along their designated invasion points pending finalization of the five-month-long undeclared war with Japan in the Far East, successful end of the conflict for the Soviet Union, which occurred in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol. On 15 September 1939, Molotov and Shigenori Tōgō completed their agreement that ended the conflict, and the Nomonhan ceasefire went into effect on 16 September 1939. Now cleared of any &quot;second front&quot; threat from the Japanese, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin ordered his forces into Poland on 17 September. It was agreed that the Soviets would relinquish its interest in the territories between the new border and Warsaw in exchange for inclusion of Lithuania in the Soviet &quot;zone of interest&quot;.

By 17 September, the Polish defence had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead. However, the plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight when the over 800,000-strong Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral. Soviet diplomacy had lied that they were &quot;protecting the Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities of eastern Poland since the Polish government had abandoned the country and the Polish state ceased to exist&quot;.

The Polish border defence forces in the east, known as the &quot;Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza&quot;, had about 25 battalions. Rydz-Śmigły ordered them to fall back and not to engage the Soviets. That, however, did not prevent some clashes and small battles, such as the Battle of Grodno, as soldiers and locals attempted to defend the city. The Soviets executed numerous Polish officers, including prisoners of war like General Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński. The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists rose against the Poles, and communist partisans organized local revolts, robbing and killing civilians. Those movements were quickly disciplined by the NKVD. The Soviet invasion was one of the decisive factors that convinced the Polish government that the war in Poland was lost. Before the Soviet attack from the east, the Polish military&#x27;s plan had called for long-term defence against Germany in south-eastern Poland and to await relief from an attack by the Western Allies on Germany&#x27;s western border. However, the Polish government refused to surrender or to negotiate peace with Germany. Instead, it ordered all units to evacuate Poland and to reorganize in France.
Meanwhile, Polish forces tried to move towards the Romanian Bridgehead area, still actively resisting the German invasion. From 17 to 20 September, Polish armies &quot;Kraków&quot; and &quot;Lublin&quot; were crippled at the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski, the second-largest battle of the campaign. Lwów capitulated on 22 September because of the Soviet intervention; the city had been attacked by the Germans over a week earlier, and in the middle of the siege, the German troops handed operations over to their Soviet allies. Despite a series of intensifying German attacks, Warsaw, defended by quickly-reorganized retreating units, civilian volunteers and militias, held out until 28 September. The Modlin Fortress north of Warsaw capitulated on 29 September, after an intense 16-day battle. Some isolated Polish garrisons managed to hold their positions long after they had been surrounded by German forces. The enclave of Westerplatte&#x27;s tiny garrison capitulated on 7 September and the Oksywie garrison held until 19 September; the Hel Fortified Area was defended until 2 October. In the last week of September, Hitler made a speech in Danzig and said:

Despite a Polish victory at the Battle of Szack (the Soviets later executed all the officers and NCOs they had captured), the Red Army reached the line of rivers Narew, Bug, Vistula and San by 28 September, in many cases meeting German units advancing from the other direction. Polish defenders on the Hel Peninsula on the shore of the Baltic Sea held out until 2 October. The last operational unit of the Polish Army, General Franciszek Kleeberg&#x27;s &quot;Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna &quot;Polesie&quot;&quot;, surrendered after the four-day Battle of Kock near Lublin on 6 October, marking the end of the September Campaign.

=== Civilian deaths ===
The Polish Campaign was the first action by Hitler in his attempt to create &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space) for Germans. Nazi propaganda was one of the factors behind the German brutality directed at civilians that had worked relentlessly to convince the Germans into believing that Jews and Slavs were &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (subhumans).

From the first day of invasion, the German air force (the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) attacked civilian targets and columns of refugees along the roads to terrorize the Polish people, disrupt communications and target Polish morale. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; killed 6,000 to 7,000 Polish civilians during the bombing of Warsaw.

The German invasion saw atrocities committed against Polish men, women and children. The German forces (both SS and the regular &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;) murdered tens of thousands of Polish civilians (such as the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler was notorious throughout the campaign for burning villages and committing atrocities in numerous Polish towns, including massacres in Błonie, Złoczew, Bolesławiec, Torzeniec, Goworowo, Mława and Włocławek).

A particular fate was reserved for the Polish girls and women who had survived the first bombing raids on Poland. Polish women and girls were raped en masse and then executed. In addition, large numbers of Polish women were routinely captured to force them into prostitution in German military brothels. Nazi raids in many Polish cities captured young women and girls, who were then forced to work in the brothels frequented by German officers and soldiers. Girls as young as 15 years old, who were classified as &quot;fit for agricultural work in Germany&quot;, were sexually exploited by German soldiers at their destination. On the Soviet side, similar events took place. The issue, with Russian soldiers raping even the women of their supposed allies, was raised with Stalin, who did not realize that it was not understood that &quot;a soldier, who has crossed thousands of kilometers through blood and fire and death, has fun with a woman or takes some trifle&quot;.

During Operation Tannenberg, a campaign of ethnic cleansing organized by multiple elements of the German government, tens of thousands of Polish civilians were shot at 760 mass execution sites by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;.

Altogether, the civilian losses of Polish population amounted to about 150,000 to 200,000. Roughly 1,250 German civilians were also killed during the invasion. (Also, 2,000 died fighting Polish troops as members of ethnic German militia forces such as the &quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot;, which was a fifth column during the invasion.)

The invasion of Poland marked the beginning of the Holocaust (&quot;holocaust by bullets&quot;), not only in its strict sense of the genocide of Jews, but also in its broader meaning of mass killings of various ethnic, political or social groups.

== Aftermath ==

John Gunther wrote in December 1939 that &quot;the German campaign was a masterpiece. Nothing quite like it has been seen in military history&quot;. The country was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union. Slovakia gained back those territories taken by Poland in autumn 1938. Lithuania received the city of Vilnius and its environs on 28 October 1939 from the Soviet Union. On 8 and 13 September 1939, the German military district in the area of Posen, commanded by general , and West Prussia, commanded by general Walter Heitz, were established in conquered Greater Poland and Pomerelia, respectively. Based on laws of 21 May 1935 and 1 June 1938, the German military delegated civil administrative powers to Chiefs of Civil Administration (&quot;CdZ&quot;). Hitler appointed Arthur Greiser to become the CdZ of the Posen military district, and Danzig&#x27;s Gauleiter Albert Forster to become the CdZ of the West Prussian military district. On 3 October 1939, the military districts centered on and named &quot;Lodz&quot; and &quot;Krakau&quot; were set up under command of major generals Gerd von Rundstedt and Wilhelm List, and Hitler appointed Hans Frank and Arthur Seyß-Inquart as civil heads, respectively. Thus the entirety of occupied Poland was divided into four military districts (West Prussia, Posen, Lodz, and Krakau). Frank was at the same time appointed &quot;supreme chief administrator&quot; for all occupied territories. On 28 September, another secret German–Soviet protocol modified the arrangements of August: all of Lithuania was shifted to the Soviet sphere of influence; in exchange, the dividing line in Poland was moved in Germany&#x27;s favour, eastwards towards the Bug River. On 8 October, Germany formally annexed the western parts of Poland with Greiser and Forster as &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot;, while the south-central parts were administered as the General Government led by Frank.

Even though water barriers separated most of the spheres of interest, the Soviet and German troops met on numerous occasions. The most remarkable event of this kind occurred at Brest-Litovsk on 22 September. The German 19th &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps—commanded by General Heinz Guderian—had occupied the city, which lay within the Soviet sphere of interest. When the Soviet 29th Tank Brigade (commanded by Semyon Krivoshein) approached, the commanders agreed that the German troops would withdraw and the Soviet troops would enter the city, saluting each other. At Brest-Litovsk, Soviet and German commanders held a joint victory parade before German forces withdrew westward behind a new demarcation line. Just three days earlier, however, the parties had a more hostile encounter near Lwów, when the German 137th &quot;Gebirgsjägerregimenter&quot; (mountain infantry regiment) attacked a reconnaissance detachment of the Soviet 24th Tank Brigade; after a few casualties on both sides, the parties turned to negotiations. The German troops left the area, and the Red Army troops entered Lwów on 22 September.

The Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and the invasion of Poland marked the beginning of a period during which the government of the Soviet Union increasingly tried to convince itself that the actions of Germany were reasonable, and were not developments to be worried about, despite evidence to the contrary. On 7 September 1939, just a few days after France and Britain joined the war against Germany, Stalin explained to a colleague that the war was to the advantage of the Soviet Union, as follows:


About 65,000 Polish troops were killed in the fighting (and roughly 3,000 prisoners of war were executed), with 420,000 others being captured by the Germans and 240,000 more by the Soviets (for a total of 660,000 prisoners). Up to 120,000 Polish troops escaped to neutral Romania (through the Romanian Bridgehead and Hungary), and another 20,000 to Latvia and Lithuania, with the majority eventually making their way to France or Britain. Most of the Polish Navy succeeded in evacuating to Britain as well. German personnel losses were less than their enemies (c. 16,000 killed).

None of the parties to the conflict—Germany, the Western Allies or the Soviet Union—expected that the German invasion of Poland would lead to a war that would surpass World War I in its scale and cost. It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a &quot;world war&quot;. Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and the Pacific War in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.

The invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been betrayed by their Western allies. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax said they were only obligated to declare war on Germany due to the first clause of the Anglo-Polish Agreement in 1939.

The different attitude of the Anglo-French allies of Poland towards Nazi Germany and the USSR was argued at this time, for example, by the future head of the British government, Churchill:

On 23 May 1939, Hitler explained to his officers that the object of the aggression was not Danzig, but the need to obtain German &quot;Lebensraum&quot; and details of this concept would be later formulated in the infamous &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;. The invasion decimated urban residential areas, civilians soon became indistinguishable from combatants, and the forthcoming German occupation (both on the annexed territories and in the General Government) was one of the most brutal episodes of World War II, resulting in between 5.47 million and 5.67 million Polish deaths (about one-sixth of the country&#x27;s total population, and over 90% of its Jewish minority)—including the mass murder of 3 million Polish citizens (mainly Jews as part of the final solution) in extermination camps like Auschwitz, in concentration camps, and in numerous ad hoc massacres, where civilians were rounded up, taken to a nearby forest, machine-gunned, and then buried, whether they were dead or not. Among the 100,000 people murdered in the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; operations in 1939–1940, approximately 61,000 were members of the Polish intelligentsia: scholars, clergy, former officers, and others, whom the Germans identified as political targets in the &quot;Special Prosecution Book-Poland&quot;, compiled before the war began in September 1939.

According to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, Soviet occupation between 1939 and 1941 resulted in the death of 150,000 and deportation of 320,000 of Polish citizens, when all who were deemed dangerous to the Soviet regime were subject to Sovietization, forced resettlement, imprisonment in labor camps (the &quot;Gulags&quot;) or murdered, like the Polish officers in the Katyn massacre.
Since October 1939, the Polish army that could escape imprisonment from the Soviets or Nazis were mainly heading for British and French territories. These places were considered safe, because of the pre-war alliance between Great-Britain, France and Poland. Not only did the government escape, but also the national gold supply was evacuated via Romania and brought to the West, notably London and Ottawa. The approximately of gold was considered sufficient to field an army for the duration of the war.

==Eyewitness accounts==
&quot;From Lemberg to Bordeaux&quot; (&#x27;Von Lemberg bis Bordeaux&#x27;), written by Leo Leixner, a journalist and war correspondent, is a first-hand account of the battles that led to the falls of Poland, the Low Countries, and France. It includes a rare eyewitness description of the Battle of Węgierska Górka. In August 1939, Leixner joined the Wehrmacht as a war reporter, was promoted to sergeant and, in 1941, published his recollections. The book was originally issued by Franz Eher Nachfolger, the central publishing house of the Nazi Party.

The American journalist and filmmaker Julien Bryan came to besieged Warsaw on 7 September 1939 in the time of German bombardment. He photographed the beginning of the war by using one roll of colour film (Kodachrome) and much black-and-white film. He made one film about German crimes against civilians during the invasion. In colour, he photographed Polish soldiers, fleeing civilians, bombed houses, and a German bomber He 111 destroyed by the Polish Army in Warsaw. His photographs and film &quot;Siege&quot; are stored in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

== Misconceptions ==
=== Combat between Polish cavalry and German tanks ===

Polish cavalry units did not engage German tanks with lances and swords. At the Battle of Tuchola Forest on 1 September 1939 the 18th Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment had been tasked to cover the retreat of Polish infantry. In the evening the Pomeranian Uhlans encountered contingents of the advancing German 20th Infantry Division of Heinz Guderian&#x27;s XIX Army. Commander Kazimierz Mastalerz ordered an attack, forcing the 20th infantry to withdraw and disperse. The engagement proved to be successful as the German advance had been delayed. However, upon redeployment, the 18th Pomeranians came under sudden and intense machine gun fire of German armored reconnaissance vehicles. Despite their quick retreat, nearly a third of the Uhlans were killed or wounded.

A group of German and Italian war correspondents, who visited the battlefield noticed the dead cavalry men and horses among the armored vehicles. Italian reporter Indro Montanelli promptly published an article in the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, on the brave and heroic Polish cavalry men, who charged German tanks with sabres and lances.

Historian Steven Zaloga in &quot;Poland 1939: The Birth of Blitzkrieg&quot; (2004):

In 1939, 10% of the Polish army was made up of cavalry units.

=== Polish Air Force ===
The Polish Air Force was not destroyed on the ground in the first days of the war. Though numerically inferior, it had been redeployed from major air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some trainers and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; lost 285 aircraft to all operational causes, with 279 more damaged, and the Poles lost 333 aircraft.

=== Polish resistance to the invasion ===
Another question concerns whether Poland inflicted any significant losses on the German forces and whether it surrendered too quickly. While exact estimates vary, Poland cost the Germans about 45,000 casualties and 11,000 damaged or destroyed military vehicles, including 993 tanks and armored cars, 565 to 697 airplanes and 370 artillery pieces. As for duration, the September Campaign lasted about a week and a half less than the Battle of France in 1940 even though the Anglo-French forces were much closer to parity with the Germans in numerical strength and equipment and were supported by the Maginot line. Furthermore, the Polish Army was preparing the Romanian Bridgehead, which would have prolonged Polish defence, but the plan was invalidated by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939.

Poland also never officially surrendered to the Germans. Under German occupation, there was continued resistance by forces such as the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;, Henryk Dobrzański&#x27;s guerrillas, and the Leśni (&quot;forest partisans&quot;).

=== First use of &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; strategy ===
It is often assumed that &quot; Blitzkrieg&quot; is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt&#x27;s in &quot;The Second World War&quot; (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to &quot;enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940&quot;, and cite that &quot;Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;&quot;. That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:

&quot;Vernichtungsgedanke&quot; was a strategy dating back to Frederick the Great, and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the French campaigns in 1870 or 1914. According to Cooper, the use of tanks &quot;left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war.&quot;

John Ellis, writing in &quot;Brute Force&quot;, asserted that, &quot;there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper&#x27;s assertion that the &quot;panzer&quot; divisions were not given the kind of &quot;strategic&quot; mission that was to characterize authentic armoured &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;, and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies&quot;. (emphasis in original)

Zaloga and Madej, in &quot;The Polish Campaign 1939&quot;, also address the subject of mythical interpretations of &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; and the importance of other arms in the campaign. They argue that Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the &quot;panzers&quot; and &quot;Stuka&quot; attacks have &quot;tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="309290" wikidata="Q7946483" url="?curid=309290" title="WAITS">
<text>WAITS was a heavily modified variant of Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Monitor operating system (later renamed to, and better known as, &quot;TOPS-10&quot;) for the PDP-6 and PDP-10 mainframe computers, used at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) from the mid-1960s up until 1991; the mainframe computer it ran on also went by the name of &quot;SAIL&quot;.

==Overview==
There was never an &quot;official&quot; expansion of WAITS, but a common variant was &quot;West-coast Alternative to ITS&quot;; another variant was &quot;Worst Acronym Invented for a Timesharing System&quot;. The name was endorsed by the SAIL community in a public vote choosing among alternatives. Two of the other contenders were SAINTS (&quot;Stanford AI New Timesharing System&quot;) and SINNERS (&quot;Stanford Incompatible Non-New Extensively Rewritten System&quot;), proposed by the systems programmers. Though WAITS was less visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted enormous indirect influence.
WAITS alumni at Xerox PARC and elsewhere also played major roles in the developments that led to the Xerox Star, the Macintosh, and the SUN workstation (later sold by Sun Microsystems).

The early screen modes of Emacs, for example, were directly inspired by WAITS&#x27; &quot;E&quot; editor – one of a family of editors that were the first to do real-time editing, in which the editing commands were invisible and where one typed text at the point of insertion/overwriting. The modern style of multi-region windowing is said to have originated there.

The system also featured an unusual level of support for what is now called multimedia computing, allowing analog audio and video signals (including TV and radio) to be switched to programming terminals. This switching capability for terminal video even allowed users in separate offices to view and type on the same virtual terminal, or a single user to instantly switch among multiple full virtual terminals.

Also invented there were &quot;bucky bits&quot; - thus, the &quot;Alt&quot; key on every IBM PC is a WAITS legacy.

One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was a news-wire search engine called NS (for News Service) that allowed WAITS hackers to instantly find, store and be notified about selected AP and New York Times news-wire stories by doing searches using arbitrary combinations of words. News story retrieval by such search was instantaneous because each story was automatically indexed by all its words when it came in over the wire.

<doc id="309292" wikidata="Q1108455" url="?curid=309292" title="Colin Fox (politician)">
<text>Colin Fox (born 17 June 1959) is a Scottish socialist politician and left-wing activist, serving as national co-spokesperson of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) since 2005. He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothians region from 2003 to 2007.

Described in &quot;The Herald&quot; as &quot;one of Scotland&#x27;s most prominent socialists&quot;, he is a founding member of the SSP and Scotland&#x27;s longest-serving party leader or spokesperson, having been originally elected as the SSP&#x27;s convener in February 2005. He was a member of the Yes Scotland Advisory Board.

==Personal life==
Fox was born in Motherwell. Both of his grandfathers were steelworkers, his mother was a nurse and his father an insurance salesman with the Co-operative Insurance Society. He attended Our Lady&#x27;s High School before studying Mathematics at Strathclyde University and Accountancy at Bell&#x27;s College, Hamilton (now part of the University of the West of Scotland). He graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Social Sciences from the Open University in 2013.

Colin currently lives in Edinburgh, with his partner and children.

==Political career==
Fox joined Scottish Labour in Motherwell and Wishaw as a teenager and established Labour Party Young Socialists (LPYS) branches throughout Lanarkshire.

He has described Tony Benn as &quot;one of my heroes&quot;, and says that it was after attending a talk given by Benn at the University of Glasgow, when Benn was running for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party, that he was inspired to get involved in politics full-time. As a prominent LPYS activist, he attracted the attention of the Militant tendency, and joined in 1981. He was elected as their Lanarkshire organiser in 1983 and has been heavily involved in socialist politics ever since.

He was active in the 1984–1985 miners&#x27;s strike in Ayrshire and at the Ravenscraig picket line. The 103-day Caterpillar occupation of 1987–88 saw him involved in the key industrial battle of the time. In 1988, he went to London to work for Militant at its headquarters in Hackney Wick. He held a variety of posts in its industrial department, finance department, and as circulation manager of the Militant newspaper. Here, he was heavily involved in the leadership of the anti-poll tax struggle which brought down Margaret Thatcher.

In 1995, he moved to Edinburgh to take up the role of Scottish Militant Labour&#x27;s East of Scotland organiser. This was the time when Militant was discarding its entryist tactics and turning towards open mass work. As a member of SML&#x27;s executive committee, he was heavily involved in the discussions with some smaller groups on the left that led to the formation of the Scottish Socialist Alliance (SSA) in 1995.

The SSA aimed to build a left-wing alternative to New Labour and the SNP. It was built around the slogan &quot;for an independent socialist Scotland&quot;. Fox was the SSA&#x27;s East of Scotland organiser, a role he continued to play when the Alliance morphed into the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in 1998.

===An MSP in Holyrood===
He led the Scottish Socialist Party in the Lothians into the first Scottish Parliament election in 1999. This was the election where Tommy Sheridan, then an SML councillor, was elected as the SSP MSP for Glasgow region. Over the course of the next four years, Colin helped build the SSP as it trebled in size.

The party in parliament succeeded in passing legislation to abolish poindings and warrant sales in 2002. Using Sheridan&#x27;s popularity, the SSP made several interventions including supporting the Fire Brigades Union dispute of 2002. But above all, it was the role the party played in the huge movement against the Iraq War that cemented the SSP&#x27;s place in Scottish politics. Against pundits&#x27; predictions, the SSP won six seats at Holyrood in 2003, including Fox in the Lothians region. Winning by just 68 votes out of 300,000, Fox was famously captured on TV hurtling across the floor of Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh when his result was finally declared.

Like his SSP colleagues, Fox refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen and was ejected from the swearing-in ceremony for singing Robert Burns&#x27; anthem &quot;Is There for Honest Poverty&quot; (or &quot;A Man&#x27;s a Man for A&#x27; That&quot;) in protest.

He sat on the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s justice committee for four years and visited many of Scotland&#x27;s prisons, arguing for reform. He presented a Member&#x27;s Bill, one of only six to get to the debating floor that session, to abolish National Health Service prescription charges in Scotland. The bill won the backing of the parliament&#x27;s health committee, but was eventually voted down by Labour, Conservative, and Lib Dem MSPs. The Scottish Government of 2007–11 later picked up the bill and introduced it themselves.

===Sheridan&#x27;s defamation action===

Sheridan, the party&#x27;s then national convenor, chose to sue a tabloid newspaper in November 2004 over stories it published about his private life. Sheridan&#x27;s decision to sue the &quot;News of the World&quot;, against the advice of the SSP executive committee, led to it demanding his resignation as convenor. Sheridan lied throughout two high-profile trials and was eventually sentenced to three years in jail, convicted on five counts of perjury.

On one occasion, Sheridan asked Fox to lie on his behalf by writing to his solicitor saying minutes of a party meeting where Sheridan admitted going to a swingers&#x27; club were false. Fox refused and told Sheridan his strategy was a &quot;train wreck&quot;. Colin Fox later summarised Sheridan&#x27;s conduct by saying he had &quot;done more damage to the socialist cause than any good he ever did it&quot;.

Fox was subsequently elected SSP national convener in Sheridan&#x27;s place, defeating Alan McCombes by 252 votes to 154, but the damage done to the party by the Glasgow MSP was substantial.

In response to Tony Blair&#x27;s plans to bring in variable top-up fees at English universities, Fox commented that previous student politicians, such as Jack Straw and Charles Clarke, &quot;were only able to be active in student politics because they didn&#x27;t have £10,000 of debt hanging round their neck and they didn&#x27;t have to rush off to work in McDonald&#x27;s&quot;. He added: &quot;Now they are kicking the ladder away from the people below them.&quot;

In June 2005, Fox took part in a peaceful protest, interrupting Question Time in the Scottish Parliament, along with three other SSP MSPs, to highlight their claim that parliament had failed to secure the right to demonstrate outside the Gleneagles Hotel where the G8 were meeting. As a consequence, he was suspended from the Scottish Parliament for the whole of September and the salaries of the party&#x27;s four MSPs and their staff were stoppedthe severest penalty meted out to any peaceful protest in British parliamentary history.

===Exit from parliament===
Fox lost his seat in the Scottish Parliament at the 2007 election, but continued to lead the party, campaigning on issues including Scottish independence, fuel poverty, bankers&#x27; bonuses, the occupation of Afghanistan, climate change, equal marriage, AIDS, and education cuts. He has contested a number of elections since 2007, standing as his party&#x27;s top candidate in the 2009 European elections, in the Lothians region for the Scottish Parliament elections in 2007 and 2011, and against Alistair Darling in Edinburgh South West at the 2010 United Kingdom general election.

In 2007, he supported Greenpeace on board their ship Arctic Sunrise in their campaign against the replacement of the UK&#x27;s nuclear weapons. He had previously visited a nuclear power station on the grounds that &quot;I am a convinced opponent of nuclear power but an opponent who wants to conduct the debate about new nuclear capacity and our energy needs on the basis of facts. My visit to Torness is at my own request.&quot; In the same year he championed the cause of affordable access to housing with his support of Midlothian Council&#x27;s investment in providing housing.

In 2008, he wrote to the First Minister Alex Salmond seeking an assurance that any future meetings with members of the Northern Ireland Assembly would raise the issue of attitudes towards LGBT rights by its ministers. More recently he has also been involved in opposing community education cuts, and has marched against cuts to public services.

In 2012, Fox was invited to join the Yes Scotland Advisory Board as a representative of the SSP when the campaign was launched.

===Independence referendum===
As a Yes Scotland Advisory Board member, Colin Fox was in great demand to speak at public meetings on the details of independence all across Scotland. He has shared platforms with Jim Sillars, John McAllion, John Finnie MSP, Jean Urquhart MSP, and Patrick Harvie MSP of the Scottish Greens. He wrote the SSP&#x27;s pamphlets &quot;The Case for an Independent Socialist Scotland&quot; and &quot;For a Modern Democratic Republic&quot;.

Fox addressed independence rallies in Edinburgh in 2012 and 2013, and spoke at the Oxford Union in May 2014 debating the motion: &quot;This House believes Scotland should be an independent country&quot;. His opponents in the debate included Lord Jim Wallace and the Labour MP for Stirling, Anne McGuire.

In June 2014, Fox wrote in the &quot;Scotsman&quot;: &quot;No country in the world is more engaged in the democratic debate over self-determination than Scotland today. September’s referendum has energised people to a remarkable extent with debates on the &#x27;democratic deficit&#x27; at the heart of Scottish politics now taking place in households, schools, workplaces, village halls and urban community centres from one end of the country to the other.&quot;

===After the referendum===

When the make-up of the Smith Commission was announced after the rejection of independence, Colin Fox protested the decision to &quot;uniquely exclude&quot; the SSP from proceedings. He wrote to the Smith Commission: &quot;The argument some use to justify our exclusion on the grounds that we currently have no &#x27;parliamentary representation&#x27; fails to appreciate that the referendum was not a parliamentary process but an unprecedented public debate that resulted in an extraordinary level of engagement from all sections of society. To exclude the SSP is to exclude an important constituency of opinion in Scottish society.&quot;

In January 2015, Fox travelled to Athens as a guest of Syriza before its victory in the January 2015 Greek legislative election. He met with Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias Turrión, and said the election result was &quot;something for socialists in Scotland to ponder deeply&quot;.

===2022 City of Edinburgh Council election===
Fox stood as a candidate for the Scottish Socialist Party in the Liberton/Gilmerton ward in the 2022 City of Edinburgh Council election.

==Other activities==
Fox is the founder and current director of the Edinburgh People&#x27;s Festival.

In October 2008, Fox stood for Rector of the University of St Andrews. He came second, losing to Kevin Dunion. He was asked to run for the position by members of St Andrews-based student groups such as Stop The War, due to his previous experience with the pro-peace and social justice movements. After losing the rectorial election in 2008, he maintained his links with the University and visited a student sit-in protest in 2009. He was invited to stand for election as rector again in 2011.

<text>Albany ( ; ) is a port city in the Great Southern region in the Australian state of Western Australia, southeast of Perth, the state capital. The city centre is at the northern edge of Princess Royal Harbour, which is a part of King George Sound. The central business district is bounded by Mount Clarence to the east and Mount Melville to the west. The city is in the local government area of the City of Albany. While it is the oldest colonial, although not European, settlement in Western Australia — predating Perth and Fremantle by over two years — it was a semi-exclave of New South Wales for over four years until it was made part of the Swan River Colony.

The settlement was founded on 26 December 1826 as a military outpost of New South Wales for the purpose of forestalling French ambitions in the region. To that end, on 21 January 1827, the commander of the outpost, Major Edmund Lockyer, formally took possession for the British Crown of the portion of New Holland not yet claimed by the Crown; that is, the portion west of the 129th meridian east, with the portion east already being claimed collectively by the Crown as New South Wales and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. During the last decade of the 19th century, the town served as a gateway to the Eastern Goldfields. For many years, it was the colony&#x27;s only deep-water port, having a place of eminence on shipping services between Britain and its Australian colonies. The opening of the Fremantle Inner Harbour in 1897, however, saw its importance as a port decline, after which the town&#x27;s industries turned primarily to agriculture, timber and later, whaling.

Contemporary Albany is the southern terminus for tourism in the region, and the state&#x27;s south west, which is known for its natural environment and preservation of its heritage. The town has a role in the ANZAC legend, being the last port of call for troopships departing Australia in the First World War. On 1 November 2014, the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers opened the National Anzac Centre in Mount Clarence, Albany, to commemorate 100 years since the first ANZAC troops departed from King George Sound. Approximately 40,000 people attended the commemoration events held between 30 October and 2 November 2014.

An auxiliary submarine base for the US Navy&#x27;s 7th Fleet was developed during the Second World War in the event the submarine base at Fremantle was lost. Also in the harbour was a Royal Australian Navy naval installation which provided for refuelling from four fuel tanks.

==Etymology==
Upon its establishment in 1826, the settlement was named Frederick Town in honour of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. In 1831, the settlement was transferred to the control of the Swan River Colony and renamed Albany by Lieutenant-Governor James Stirling.

The name of the area in the Nyungar language of the Menang people is , which has been said to mean &quot;place of plenty&quot; and &quot;place of rain&quot;. In 2020, the City of Albany began, as part of an official dual-naming project, to give prominence to &quot;Kinjarling&quot; as the city&#x27;s Aboriginal name.

==Early history==

Kinjarling was home to Menang Noongar tribes during the summer season. Early British explorers recorded evidence of fish traps located on Emu Point and on the French, now the Kalgan, River. Vancouver made attempts to find the inhabitants of the area but only found bark dwellings that were unoccupied. Later explorers made contact and were told to leave, but were accepted when they did not. Most of the British exploration was undertaken to survey the land and sea to assess the profitability of resources. The explorers occasionally noted encounters with Noongars. Native treatment laws and programs have affected the tribes since settlement.

==Heritage buildings==
There are a number of heritage buildings in Albany; see List of heritage places in the City of Albany and :Category:Heritage places in Albany, Western Australia. These include:

*The Old Farm, Strawberry Hill was established in 1827 as a government farm to feed the colonial soldiers stationed around King George&#x27;s Sound. It is the oldest farm in Western Australia. The homestead, which became the home of the Government Resident in 1833, is an example of a colonial gentleman&#x27;s residence. After a chequered history, the property was vested in the National Trust WA in 1964 and is now a house museum.
*Patrick Taylor Cottage (1832), Western Australia&#x27;s oldest surviving dwelling, built in 1832 by the Morley Brothers. It is now maintained by the Albany Historical Society.
*St John&#x27;s Church (1841–1848) is a stone building with shingled roofs in the Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque style. Set among trees, it was designed to be part of an overall contrived picturesque scene in the manner of an English garden landscape.
*Scots Uniting Church (1892) was designed in the Victorian Academic Gothic style by Melbourne architect Evander McIver and built with local granite stonework.
*The complex now known as The Residency Museum was established in 1850 as a depot for the Convict Establishment in Albany. It is an L-shaped, single-storied, masonry building with a timber framed, timber shingled roof. In 1873 it was converted into the Resident Magistrate&#x27;s home. It now serves as a museum.
*The Victorian Free Classical Revival style Town Hall (1888) is a two-storey stone building with a prominent clock tower, which dominates York Street, the main street of Albany. It has been put to many uses apart from council meetings, including public entertainment and public meetings of all kinds and even as the venue for the first regional meeting of the State Parliament.
*The Old Post Office was built in two stages, the first was designed in 1869 by J Manning, the second, including a prominent tower, was designed in 1896 by George Temple-Poole. It now houses the Albany campus of the University of Western Australia.
*The Court House, constructed of Albany brick and granite with a tiled roof, was designed in the Federation Romanesque style by the Public Works Department under the supervision of George Temple-Poole and Hillson Beasley in 1897.
*Another example of the work of George Temple Poole is the limestone and shingle Federation Arts and Crafts style Cottage Hospital, designed in 1886 and completed in 1897. It is one of the oldest hospitals in the state and served as such until 1962. It is now occupied by the Vancouver Arts Centre (named after the explorer George Vancouver).

<text>The blue-tailed day gecko (Phelsuma cepediana), also known commonly as Lacépède&#x27;s gecko, is a diurnal species of gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to the island Mauritius. It typically inhabits warm and humid places and dwells on different trees and bushes.

Additionally, it is noteworthy that the blue-tailed day gecko can change colors and patterns ontogenetically. Depending on the activity, coloration can differ.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;cepediana&quot;, is in honor of French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède.

==Description==
&quot;P. cepediana&quot; is a mid-sized day gecko. It can reach a total length (including tail) of 3.75–5.5 in (9.5–14 cm). The female blue-tailed gecko is usually smaller in size than the male.

The male blue-tailed geckos is typically more vivid than the female. The male body colour is light green or bluish green. The back of the male has a bright blue colour and is covered with dark red spots and dashes. The male has a deep blue tail; this blue color may also be found on the face. The female lacks the brilliant blue colour of the male. The female has a bright green back and rust-coloured spots. There is always a dorso-lateral stripe present, which may be broken. A red stripe extends from the nostril to the shoulder.

==Habitat and distribution==
The blue-tailed gecko and other reptiles are sensitive to artificial light at night and will change their behaviors as a result of being exposed to this light. The blue-tailed gecko is primarily diurnal, as are most of the geckos in its genus (Phelsuma). It has been found that the blue-tailed gecko will change its foraging behavior from diurnal to nocturnal in situations in which it has artificial light sources at its disposal. Nocturnal activity includes agonistic or aggressive behaviors, courtship, and foraging. When artificial lights are used in nocturnal situations, it alters the amount of time and effort that visual predators will spend foraging.

&quot;P. cepediana&quot; is one of only seven species of the Mascarene species that is still extant. This species is the sole pollinator and seed disperser of a climbing shrub, &quot;Roussea simplex&quot;, which is endemic to the mountains of Mauritius. &quot;P. cepediana&quot; can typically be found on trees and bushes that produce fruits, such as coconut palms, banana trees, and papayas. These locations are warm and moist climates, which are preferred by this gecko.

The blue-tailed day gecko inhabits the island Mauritius where it is widely distributed. &quot;P. cepediana&quot; may also have been introduced to Madagascar where it has been reported a few times, amongst others in the region of Iviloina. These observations have not been confirmed, however. Although &quot;P. cepediana&quot; seems to be unable to colonize agricultural areas, it can survive in suburban gardens that are heavily watered and planted as long as these gardens are near trees that produce fruit or flowers throughout the year. 

==Diet==
The blue-tailed day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also licks soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar. The flowers of the now critically endangered liana &quot;Roussea simplex&quot; produce copious amounts of nectar and are pollinated only by the blue-tailed day gecko. The blue-tailed day gecko plays a role by licking up a gelatinous substance secreted by the fruit which contains the minute seeds. It disperses the seeds in its droppings. 

==Behavior==
&quot;P. cepediana&quot; can be quite aggressive toward both its own and to other &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species. In captivity, where the female cannot escape, the male sometimes seriously wounds the female. In this case, the male and female must be separated.

=== Protective coloration and behavior ===
Lizards can change in color and pattern ontogenetically. Conspicuous tail colors appear only in juveniles and can fade by adulthood. Research has been conducted in order to determine if these tail colors compensate for &quot;an increased activity, level, deflecting imminent attacks to the tail.&quot; Research has suggested that alteration of activities can affect the ontogenetic color and pattern changes. Lizards that are active and forage in habitats that are open tend to increase the probability that they will be attacked by ambush predators. Deflection displays and conspicuous colors can shift attacks to the expendable tail. By doing this, the prey&#x27;s overall likelihood of surviving the attack is increased.

==Reproduction==
The adult female blue-tailed gecko lays eggs every 3–4 weeks. It typically lays two eggs in a clutch. 

The female will lay its eggs in a location that it feels is safe and protected. It will glue its eggs in order to increase safety. When they are kept at a temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, the eggs take between 40 and 45 days to hatch. When the newborns are measured, they are normally around 40 mm (1.6 inches).

==Predators==

The blue-tailed gecko frequently will hide amongst dense patches of palm-like Pandanus plants in order to protect itself from its enemies. &quot;P. cepediana&quot; is preyed upon by the critically endangered Mauritius kestrel. This bird feeds almost exclusively on &quot;Phelsuma&quot; geckos, making &quot;P. cepediana&quot; one of its main prey items. Other birds that are endemic to Mauritius also feed on &quot;Phelsuma&quot; geckos. 

The 2mm-long ant &quot;Technomyrmex albipes&quot; that was introduced to Mauritius from the Indo-Pacific area seals the flowers of &quot;Roussea&quot; with clay to protect mealy bugs. The mealy bugs drink the sap and excrete a sugary urine that is collected by the ants. The ants attack animals that visit the plant, preventing the blue-tailed day gecko from pollinating the flowers and eating from the fruit, and in this way seriously hampering &quot;Roussea&#x27;s&quot; reproduction.

==Captivity==
Male &quot;P. cepediana&quot; are extremely high in demand as pets due to their vibrant coloration, and can cost $100 to $200 each. With good care, blue-tailed day geckos may live up to 15 years.

<text>Christian Marclay (born January 11, 1955) is a visual artist and composer. He holds both American and Swiss nationality.

Marclay&#x27;s work explores connections between sound art, noise music, photography, video art, film and digital animations. A pioneer of using gramophone records and turntables as musical instruments to create sound collages, Marclay is, in the words of critic Thom Jurek, perhaps the &quot;unwitting inventor of turntablism.&quot; His own use of turntables and records, beginning in the late 1970s, was developed independently of but roughly parallel to hip hop&#x27;s use of the instrument.

==Early life and education==
Christian Marclay was born on January 11, 1955, in San Rafael, Marin County, California, to a Swiss father and an American mother and raised in Geneva, Switzerland. He studied at the Ecole Supérieure d&#x27;Art Visuel in Geneva (1975–1977), the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston (1977–1980, Bachelor of Fine Arts) in the Studio for Interrelated Media Program, and the Cooper Union in New York (1978). As a student he was notably interested in Joseph Beuys and the Fluxus movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Long based in Manhattan, Marclay has in recent years divided his time between New York and London.

==Work==

Citing the influence of John Cage, Yoko Ono and Vito Acconci, Marclay has long explored the rituals around making and collecting music. Drawn to the energy of punk rock, he began creating songs, singing to music on pre-recorded backing tapes. In 1979, he formed a punk rock band called Bachelors Even with his friend, guitarist Kurt Henry. Unable to recruit a drummer for the band, Marclay used the regular rhythms of a skipping LP record as a percussion instrument. These duos with Henry might be the first time a musician used records and turntables as interactive, improvising musical instruments.
Marclay sometimes manipulates or damages records to produce continuous loops and skips, and has said he generally prefers inexpensive used records purchased at thrift shops, as opposed to other turntablists who often seek out specific recordings. In 1998, he claimed never to have paid more than US$1 for a record. Marclay has occasionally cut and re-joined different LP records; when played on a turntable, these re-assembled records will combine snippets of different music in quick succession along with clicks or pops from the seams – typical of noise music – and when the original LPs were made of differently-colored vinyl, the reassembled LPs can themselves be considered as works of art.

Some of Marclay&#x27;s musical pieces are carefully recorded and edited plunderphonics-style; he is also active in free improvisation. He was filmed performing a duo with Erikm for the documentary &quot;Scratch&quot;. His scene didn&#x27;t make the final cut, but is included among the DVD extras.

Marclay released &quot;Record Without a Cover&quot; on Recycled Records in 1985, &quot;...designed to be sold without a jacket, not even a sleeve!&quot; Accumulating dust and fingerprints would enhance the sound. A review in &quot;Spin&quot; at the time cited Marclay&#x27;s &quot;coolest theatrical gesture&quot; in his live performances of phonoguitar: the artist strapped a record player onto himself and played, for example, a Jimi Hendrix album. In his artwork &quot;Five Cubes&quot; (1989), he melted vinyl records into cubes. &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; (1988) is a black-and-white photograph of the Simon &amp; Garfunkel single of the same title.

Following this turn, Marclay has in more recent years produced visual art, although usually of representations of sound, or the various technologies of representing sound. His &quot;Graffiti Composition&quot; (2002) posted musical notes on walls around Berlin, compiled photographs of them as they faded, and is performed in concert. During his residency at Eyebeam, Marclay created &quot;Screen Play&quot; (2005), a twenty minute video of black and white images overlaid with colorful computer graphics. For Performa 05, the first edition of the Performa Biennial, two ensembles and one soloist interpreted &quot;Screen Play&quot;.

&quot;Shuffle&quot; (2007) and &quot;Ephemera&quot; (2009) are also musical scores. In &quot;Sound Holes&quot; (2007), he photographed the many patterns of speaker holes on intercoms. From 2007-2009 he worked with cyanotype at Graphicstudio to capture the motion of cassette tapes unspooling. And an interest in onomatopoeia dating back to 1989 has culminated in his monumental &quot;Manga Scroll&quot; (2010), a 60-foot scroll of cartoon interjections that doubles as a musical score.

In 2010, he produced &quot;The Clock&quot;, a 24-hour compilation of time-related scenes from movies that debuted at London&#x27;s White Cube gallery in 2010. In 2016, he produced &quot;Made to Be Destroyed&quot;, a compilation of film clips showing the destruction of art works or buildings. Marclay made several forays into video art that informed &quot;The Clock&quot;. His 1995 film &quot;Telephones&quot; forms a narrative out of clips from Hollywood films where characters use a telephone. His 1998 film &quot;Up and Out&quot; combines video from Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot; with audio from Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Blow Out&quot;. It was an early experiment in the effect of synchronization, where viewers naturally attempted to find intersections between the two works, and it developed the editing style that Marclay employs for &quot;The Clock&quot;.

Thom Jurek writes: &quot;While many intellectuals have made wild pronouncements about Marclay and his art – and it is art, make no mistake – writing all sorts of blather about how he strips the adult century bare by his cutting up of vinyl records and pasting them together with parts from other vinyl records, they never seem to mention that these sound collages of his are charming, very human, and quite often intentionally hilarious.&quot;

In addition to his solo performances and recordings, Marclay has also collaborated with many musicians, including John Zorn, William Hooker, Elliott Sharp, Otomo Yoshihide, Butch Morris, Shelley Hirsch, Flo Kaufmann and Crevice; he has also performed with the group Sonic Youth, and in other projects with Sonic Youth&#x27;s members.

==Personal life==
Marclay began dating curator Lydia Yee in 1991, and the couple married in 2011.

==Recognition==
At the 2011 Venice Biennale, representing the United States, Marclay was recognized as the best artist in the official exhibition, winning the Golden Lion for &quot;The Clock&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; responded by naming Marclay one of the ten most important artists of today. Accepting the Golden Lion, Marclay invoked Andy Warhol, thanking the jury &quot;for giving &quot;The Clock&quot; its fifteen minutes&quot;. In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Berlin Mix&quot; the 17th best work of performance art in history.

In 2015, the White Cube presented a major solo exhibition including a range of new work and a lively programme of weekly performances played by the London Sinfonietta and guests, including Thurston Moore and Mica Levi.

<text>In aerospace engineering, the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicle&#x27;s mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle&#x27;s performance. In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design. Another related measure is the payload fraction, which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload. It can be applied to a vehicle, a stage of a vehicle or to a rocket propulsion system.

==Formulation==
The propellant mass fraction is given by:
formula_1
where:
*formula_2 is the propellant mass fraction
*formula_3 is the initial mass of the vehicle
*formula_4 is the propellant mass
*formula_5 is the final mass of the vehicle

==Significance==
In rockets for a given target orbit, a rocket&#x27;s mass fraction is the portion of the rocket&#x27;s pre-launch mass (fully fueled) that does not reach orbit. The propellant mass fraction is the ratio of just the propellant to the entire mass of the vehicle at takeoff (propellant plus dry mass). In the cases of a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle or suborbital vehicle, the mass fraction equals the propellant mass fraction, which is simply the fuel mass divided by the mass of the full spaceship. A rocket employing staging, which are the only designs to have reached orbit, has a mass fraction higher than the propellant mass fraction because parts of the rocket itself are dropped off en route. Propellant mass fractions are typically around 0.8 to 0.9.

In aircraft, mass fraction is related to range, an aircraft with a higher mass fraction can go farther. Aircraft mass fractions are typically around 0.5.

When applied to a rocket as a whole, a low mass fraction is desirable, since it indicates a greater capability for the rocket to deliver payload to orbit for a given amount of fuel. Conversely, when applied to a single stage, where the propellant mass fraction calculation doesn&#x27;t include the payload, a higher propellant mass fraction corresponds to a more efficient design, since there is less non-propellant mass. Without the benefit of staging, SSTO designs are typically designed for mass fractions around 0.9. Staging increases the payload fraction, which is one of the reasons SSTOs appear difficult to build.

For example, the complete Space Shuttle system has:
* fueled weight at liftoff: 1,708,500 kg
* dry weight at liftoff: 342,100 kg

Given these numbers, the propellant mass fraction is formula_6.

The mass fraction plays an important role in the rocket equation:

:formula_7

Where formula_8 is the ratio of final mass to initial mass (i.e., one minus the mass fraction), formula_9 is the change in the vehicle&#x27;s velocity as a result of the fuel burn and formula_10 is the effective exhaust velocity (see below).

The term effective exhaust velocity is defined as:

:formula_11

where &quot;I&quot;sp is the fuel&#x27;s specific impulse in seconds and &quot;g&quot;n is the &quot;standard acceleration of gravity&quot; (note that this is not the local acceleration of gravity).

To make a powered landing from orbit on a celestial body without an atmosphere requires the same mass reduction as reaching orbit from its surface, if the speed at which the surface is reached is zero.

<text>Robert G. Jordan (April 1, 1923 – September 10, 1965) was an American actor, most notable for being a member of the Dead End Kids, the East Side Kids, the Little Tough Guys, and the Bowery Boys.

==Early life and career==
Jordan was born in Harrison, New York. At the age of four, he worked in an early movie version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. His mother took him to talent shows in and around Harrison, New York. He also modeled for newspaper and magazine advertisements and appeared in short films and radio programs. In the late 1920s, his family moved to the Upper West Side of Manhattan. In 1929, he was cast as Charles Hildebrand in the 1929 Broadway play &quot;Street Scene&quot;.

==Dead End Kids and offshoots==
The youngest of the Dead End Kids, Jordan was the first of the group to work in films (in 1931 at the Vitaphone studio in Brooklyn, alongside future screen teammate David Gorcey). In 1935, he won the role of Angel in Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s Broadway drama &quot;Dead End&quot; about life in the slums of the east side of New York City. The play was performed at the Belasco Theatre and ran for three years and more than 600 performances. He appeared for the first season and the beginning of the second but left in mid-November 1936. He returned in time to join the others in 1937 in Hollywood, California to make the movie version of the play, starring Humphrey Bogart, Joel McCrea, Sylvia Sidney, and Claire Trevor.

Following the making of &quot;Dead End&quot;, the young actors (now known professionally as &quot;The Dead End Kids&quot;), were released from their contract with Goldwyn, and subsequently they were signed by Warner Bros. After one year, Warners released most of them, but kept Leo Gorcey and Jordan as solo performers. Jordan appeared (as Douglas Fairbanks Rosenbloom) in Warner&#x27;s Damon Runyon comedy &quot;A Slight Case of Murder&quot; (1938) and at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in &quot;Young Tom Edison&quot; (1940).

In 1940, Jordan appeared in the movie &quot;Military Academy&quot; and accepted an offer from producer Sam Katzman to star in a new tough-kid series titled &quot;The East Side Kids&quot;. Leo Gorcey soon joined him, then Huntz Hall, and the trio continued to lead the series until 1943. Meanwhile, Universal Pictures had launched a competing series, &quot;The Little Tough Guys&quot;, which gradually recruited most of the original Dead End Kids; Bobby Jordan joined in 1940. When gang leader Billy Halop left the series to join the armed forces, Bobby Jordan replaced him in &quot;Keep &#x27;Em Slugging&quot; (1943).

Jordan entered the United States Army during World War II as a foot soldier in the 97th Infantry Division. While on furlough he made some fast cash by appearing as himself, in uniform, in the East Side Kids comedy &quot;Bowery Champs&quot; (1944). He was subsequently involved in an elevator accident that forced him to have surgery to remove his right kneecap.

==Later career and personal life==
Leo Gorcey abruptly quit the East Side Kids in 1945. Bobby Jordan arranged a meeting with his agent, Jan Grippo, who in turn set up a new production company with Gorcey, Huntz Hall, and Jordan featured in the new &quot;Bowery Boys&quot; series. After the series began filming, Jordan soon found that Gorcey and Hall were getting the lion&#x27;s share of both the films&#x27; content and salary. (Jordan received only a small fraction of the salary Gorcey was getting.) Dissatisfied with his background status, Jordan left the series after eight entries, and made only a few films thereafter.

He returned to films in 1949 (as Robert Jordan), playing a character role in the low-budget drama &quot;Treasure of Monte Cristo&quot;. Future assignments were few and far between, and the discouraged actor began drinking heavily. In subsequent years, Jordan worked as a bartender, a bad choice considering his alcoholism. He worked to support his family as a door-to-door photograph salesman and as a roughneck for an oil driller.

He did manage a few roles on television. On July 1, 1957, Jordan played Bob Ford, the assailant of Jesse James, in the television series &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;. One of his later performances was in an episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot; titled &quot;The Many Faces of Gideon Flinch&quot;, where he played one of Bullet Head Burke&#x27;s men.

In 1957, Jordan and his wife divorced; they had one son, Robert Jr.

==Death==
On August 25, 1965, Jordan entered the Veterans Hospital in Sawtelle, California, for treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. He died on September 10, 1965 at the age of 42. His former Dead End Kids and East Side Kids co-star Leo Gorcey observed in his memoir, &quot;Bobby Jordan must not have had a guardian angel.&quot;

<text>Siglufjörður () is a small fishing town in a narrow fjord with the same name on the northern coast of Iceland.

The population in 2011 was 1,206; the town has been shrinking in size since the 1950s when the town reached its peak of 3,000 inhabitants.

The municipalities of Ólafsfjörður and Siglufjörður, connected since 2010 by the Héðinsfjörður Tunnels, merged in 2006 to form a municipality called Fjallabyggð, which literally means &quot;Mountain Settlement&quot;.

Siglufjörður is the site of The Herring Era Museum, a maritime museum which opened in 1994.

== History ==
The town grew up around the herring industry that was very strong in the 1940s and 1950s. The first Icelandic Municipal Savings Bank was founded in Siglufjörður in 1873, and on 22 October 1918 Siglufjörður attained municipal status () with the rights and privileges of a town. The number of inhabitants amounted to 146 in 1901 and to 415 in 1910, to 1,159 in 1920, to 2,022 in 1930, to 2,884 in 1940, to 3,015 in 1950, to 2,860 in 1960, to 2,161 in 1970 and to 2,047 in 1979. In 1989 Siglufjörður had 1,806 inhabitants. 
Herring fishing declined considerably after 1970, and the herring processing plants were closed. Many people left the area. Today the town remains dependent on fishing industries. The government of Iceland is attempting to reverse the population shrinking in the area by improving land transportation and by promoting tourism. Today herring fishing is no longer productive in the region.

==Sights and cultural events==
Siglufjörður is famous for its Herring Festival (, ) which is held every year in August, and for its Herring Museum ( ) which can be visited in , a historic building dating from 1907.

 is a music festival which is held every year in July. The town is famous for Bjarni Þorsteinsson (1861–1938), a composer and priest who lived in Siglufjörður from 1888 on. He collected many old folk songs which had nearly been forgotten and published them again between 1906 and 1909. The oldest house in town dating from 1884 was transformed into a Bjarni þorsteinsson Museum referring to traditional Icelandic folk music and to historical musical instruments.

 , a Protestant church consecrated in 1932, has 400 seats. With a length of 35 metres and a breadth of 12 metres, it is comparatively large. The two large clocks on its tower, which is 30 metres in height, were donated by the Savings Bank in 1932. Inside the church there is a sightworthy altar painting dating from 1726 which shows the Last Supper. The colourful church windows were created by the German artist Maria Katzgrau (1913–1998) and added in 1974. Ragnar Kjartansson, an Icelandic artist, created the tall sculpture (Herring Fishing) which can be seen in front of the church. , another sightworthy memorial which was unveiled close to the harbour in 1988, refers to 62 seamen from Siglufjörður who lost their lives on sea between 1900 and 1988.

One of the oldest buildings in town is &quot;Sæbyhús&quot;, a wooden house which was built in 1886 and enlarged in 1915.

&quot;Norska sjómannaheimilið&quot; is a large wooden residential building which was built in 1915 for Norwegian seamen working in Siglufjörður. It was also used as a medical center for injured and sick seamen. The wood had been prepared in Haugesund in Norway before the construction. Today the building which was renovated 1986-1986 is used as a conservatoire.

== Current ==
The dual Héðinsfjörður Tunnels, with a total length of , were dug between Siglufjörður and Ólafsfjörður to connect with the region of Eyjafjörður in the east, and opened on 2 October 2010. Siglufjörður was already connected by the 800 m tunnel Strákagöng to the west; it used to be the town&#x27;s only road connection open year-round. That tunnel was completed in 1967 and before then the only road to the town was a narrow mountain pass between Siglufjörður and Héðinsfjörður, open only during the summer. The new tunnel opened interesting mountain tracks and trout fishing opportunities to those without boats and unwilling to walk the old trail.

==Sports==
The old road to Siglufjörður is open during the summer. It is the highest mountain road in Iceland and is used today for hiking, horse riding and pleasure driving. 
Siglufjörður has developed into the Icelandic centre of winter sports. There are two ski lifts and a ski jump hill. In January 2021, the ski area of Siglufjörður was destroyed by a snowslide.

== In popular culture ==
Baltasar Kormákur&#x27;s 2015 TV series &quot;Ófærð&quot; (&quot;Trapped&quot;) was filmed almost entirely in Siglufjörður, with the exception of a few outdoor scenes shot in the Eastfjords and Reykjavík.

The town is also the setting of Ragnar Jónasson&#x27;s detective series entitled &quot;Dark Iceland&quot;.

==Traffic connections==
Siglufjörður was connected by road for the first time in 1940, when the horse-riding trail through was improved, enabling cars to get through. Before that ships, seaplanes, horses and walking provided transport.

Siglufjörður has a small airfield. There have, however, not been regular flights to Siglufjörður for many years, but private small planes make frequent landings. The closest airport with scheduled flights is in Akureyri, an hour&#x27;s drive from Siglufjörður.

==Daylight hours==
Siglufjörður experiences midnight sun from 9 June until 1 July.

Siglufjörður does not experience polar night at the December solstice; the shortest daylight hours in Siglufjörður are 2 hours 39 minutes, from 11:54 UTC until 14:33 UTC on 21 December.

<text>Willemstad ( , , ; ) is the capital and largest city of Curaçao, an island in the southern Caribbean Sea that is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was the capital of the Netherlands Antilles prior to that entity&#x27;s dissolution in 2010. The city counts to have around 90% of Curaçao’s population, with 136,660 inhabitants as of 2011. The historic centre of the city consists of four quarters: the Punda and Otrobanda, which are separated by the Sint Anna Bay, an inlet that leads into the large natural harbour called the Schottegat, as well as the Scharloo and Pietermaai Smal quarters, which are across from each other on the smaller Waaigat harbour. Willemstad is home to the Curaçao synagogue, the oldest surviving synagogue in the Americas. The city centre, with its unique architecture and harbour entry, has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==
Punda was established in 1634, when the Dutch West India Company captured the island from Spain. The original name of Punda was &quot;de punt&quot; in Dutch. The city was constructed as a walled city. It soon developed into one of the major centres of the Atlantic slave trade which triggered a rapid population growth. In 1674, the Curaçao synagogue was built by Sephardic Portuguese Jews from Amsterdam and Recife, Brazil who had settled in the city as traders. In the late 17th century, there were over 200 houses within the city walls.

In 1675, it was decided to construct the town of Pietermaai outside of the enclosed city. It was to be separated from the city by an area of about 500 metres in which construction was not allowed so as not to obstruct the cannons in Fort Amsterdam. In 1707, the suburb of Otrobanda was founded. Otrobanda would become the cultural centre of Willemstad. Its name originated from the Papiamentu &quot;otro banda&quot;, which means &quot;the opposite side&quot;. The suburb of Scharloo followed, however Willemstad continued to experience growth. By 1818, the population of Willemstad had grown to 9,536 people. On 13 May 1861, a decision was made to demolish the city walls, and build residential houses in the gap separating Willemstad from Pietermaai.

Around 1925, the booming oil and phosphate industry further stimulated growth, and resulted in the creation of new neighbourhoods. Between 1945 and 1955, Julianadorp and Emmastad were created by Royal Dutch Shell to house the new workers. In 1985, the oil refinery which employed 12,000 people was closed down by Shell. The Government of Curaçao decided to buy the refinery for ƒ 1.00 and take responsibility for all future pollution claims. In 1986, it was leased to the Venezuelan PDVSA, and reopened on a limited scale. In 2017, the PDVSA was hit by punitive sanctions of the United States Government, and attempts have been made to seize the refinery.

On 30 May 1969, the Curaçao uprising, a strike at a subcontractor of the oil refinery, turned into a riot. The riot resulted in two deaths, 300 arrests and a part of the historic centre being burnt down. The Netherlands Marine Corps was sent to Willemstad and the entire city centre was closed down. In 1997, the centre of Willemstad and its former suburbs were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the 21st century, a largescale program of renovation started.
==Economy==
===Aviation===
Jetair Caribbean, the national airline of Curaçao, has its corporate head office in Maduro Plaza.

===Tourism===

Tourism is a major industry and the city has several casinos. The city centre of Willemstad has an array of colonial architecture that is influenced by Dutch styles. Archaeological research has also been developed there. The city is also home to several beaches like Baya Beach.

===Industry===
Owing to its location near the Venezuelan oilfields, its political stability and its natural deep water harbour, Willemstad became the site of an important seaport and refinery. Willemstad&#x27;s harbour is one of the largest oil handling ports in the Caribbean. The refinery, at one point the largest in the world, was originally built and owned by Royal Dutch Shell in 1915.

The four companies comprising the Royal Dutch Shell refining operation; the actual refinery, oil bunkering, the tugboat company (KTK) and the local distribution of refined products (CurOli/Gas) were each sold to the government of Curaçao in 1985 for the symbolic sum of one guilder per company, or a total of 4 guilders and is now leased to PDVSA, the state owned Venezuelan oil company. Schlumberger, the world&#x27;s largest oil field services company is incorporated in Willemstad.
===Financial services===
Numerous financial institutions are incorporated in Willemstad due to Curaçao&#x27;s favourable tax policies.

==Education==
The University of Curaçao is the national university of Curaçao and located in Willemstad. The Avalon University School of Medicine is located in Willemstad. The Caribbean Medical University is also located in Willemstad, close to the city centre.

Pabao Little League has appeared in nine Little League World Series, winning in 2004. They were crowned the International Champions in 2005, 2019, 2022, and 2023. In 2008, another Pabao Little League team won the Junior League World Series, after winning the Latin America Region, then defeating the Asia-Pacific Region and Mexico Region champions to become the International champion, and finally defeating the U.S. champion (West Region), Hilo American/National LL (Hilo, Hawaii), 5–2.

==Infrastructure==
===Airport===
Willemstad is served by Curaçao International Airport, located north of the city, which is annually used by about two million passengers.

===Bridges===
Punda and Otrobanda are connected by Queen Emma Bridge, a long pontoon bridge. Although it is still in use, these days most road traffic now uses the Queen Juliana Bridge built in 1967 (rebuilt 1974) which arches high over the bay further inland. Nearby is also the now non-functioning Queen Wilhelmina drawbridge.

<text>Chûn Castle is a large Iron Age hillfort (ringfort) near Penzance in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The fort was built about 2,500 years ago, and fell into disuse until the early centuries AD when it was possibly re-occupied to protect the nearby tin mines. It stands beside a prehistoric trackway that was formerly known as the Old St Ives Road and the Tinners’ Way.
The name &quot;Chûn&quot; derives from (‘the house on the downs’). The area is now sometimes known as Chûn Downs. Nearby is Chûn Quoit.

==Description==
Edward Lluyd made a plan of this fort in around 1700, remarking that its structure and security showed &quot;military knowledge superior to that of any other works of this kind which I have seen in Cornwall&quot;. Notably, the fort has a strategic inner and outer wall and ditch. The remains today are still clearly visible, even though the once twenty-feet-odd walls now stand at around five feet, due to its use in the 19th century as a quarry for buildings in Penzance and Madron. The freehold of the land beneath part of the castle was put up for auction in April 1883 as part of freehold tenement of Little Bosullow. Included were large quantities of good building stone. At the 1886 annual meeting of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, concern was shown for the removal of stone from here, as well as Kenidjack Castle and Madron Well.

The fort was excavated in 1895, 1925, 1927 and 1930. Much pottery was uncovered; the earliest was dated to the 4th century BC due to its similarity to known Breton pottery of that age. But the fort may have been built upon a much older structure. Chûn Quoit, around 800 feet to the west, is dated to around 2400 BC. It is believed that the fort fell into disuse around the first century AD but was reoccupied and modified several centuries later, until the 6th century. However, occupation may also date to the later Roman period.

The fort may have been built to protect tin and copper gathered in the tin-rich locality of what is now Pendeen, with its Geevor Tin Mine, and surrounding villages. Iron and tin slags were found within the fort, near the well. The fort overlooks many miles of the Celtic Sea to the north, and overlooks the only land route to this peninsula (West Penwith) to the south. Therefore, not only its structure but its location suggest a much more actively military function.

The well, within the inner walls, once had a stairway leading to the water, water which remains to this day even during dry spells. Locals used the well water until the 1940s for domestic purposes and some for superstitious reasons, viz. the endowment of perpetual youth. Neopagans still make pilgrimages to the site on religiously significant days.

<text>Capparis spinosa, the caper bush, also called Flinders rose, is a perennial plant that bears rounded, fleshy leaves and large white to pinkish-white flowers.

The taxonomic status of the species is controversial and unsettled. Species within the genus &quot;Capparis&quot; are highly variable, and interspecific hybrids have been common throughout the evolutionary history of the genus. As a result, some authors have considered &quot;C. spinosa&quot; to be composed of multiple distinct species, others that the taxon is a single species with multiple varieties or subspecies, or that the taxon &quot;C. spinosa&quot; is a hybrid between &quot;C. orientalis&quot; and &quot;C. sicula&quot;.

&quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; is native to almost all the circum-Mediterranean countries, and is included in the flora of most of them, but whether it is indigenous to this region is uncertain. The family Capparaceae could have originated in the tropics and later spread to the Mediterranean basin.

The plant is best known for the edible flower buds (capers), used as a seasoning or garnish, and the fruit (caper berries), both of which are usually consumed salted or pickled. Other species of &quot;Capparis&quot; are also picked along with &quot;C. spinosa&quot; for their buds or fruits. Other parts of &quot;Capparis&quot; plants are used in the manufacture of medicines and cosmetics.

== Description ==

The shrubby plant is many-branched, with alternate leaves, thick and shiny, round to ovate. The flowers are complete, sweetly fragrant, and showy, with four sepals and four white to pinkish-white petals, many long violet-coloured stamens, and a single stigma usually rising well above the stamens.

== Accepted infraspecifics ==
Eleven subspecies and variants are accepted, according to Plants of the World Online:

* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; var. &quot;aegyptia&quot; (Lam.) Boiss.
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; var. &quot;atlantica&quot; (Inocencio, D.Rivera, Obón &amp; Alcaraz) Fici
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; var. &quot;canescens&quot; Coss.
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; subsp. &quot;cordifolia&quot; (Lam.) Fici
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; var. &quot;herbacea&quot; (Willd.) Fici
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; var. &quot;mucronifolia&quot; (Boiss.) Hedge &amp; Lamond ex R.R.Stewart
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; var. &quot;myrtifolia&quot; (Inocencio, D.Rivera, Obón &amp; Alcaraz) Fici
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; var. &quot;ovata&quot; (Desf.) Sm.
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; subsp. &quot;parviflora&quot; (Boiss.) Ahmadi, H.Saeidi &amp; Mirtadz.
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; subsp. &quot;rupestris&quot; (Sm.) Nyman
* &quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; subsp. &quot;spinosa&quot;

&quot;Capparis nummularia&quot; was formerly considered a subspecies of &quot;Capparis spinosa.&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Capparis spinosa&quot; ranges around the Mediterranean Basin, Arabian Peninsula, and portions of Western and Central Asia.

In southern Europe, it is found in southern Portugal, southern and eastern Spain (including the Balearic Islands), Mediterranean France including Corsica, Italy including Sicily and Sardinia, Croatia&#x27;s Dalmatian islands, Albania, Greece and the Greek Islands, western and southern Turkey, on Cyprus, and on the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine. In Spain, it ranges from sea level up to in elevation.

In northern Africa, it is found throughout the north and the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, where it occurs from sea level up to in elevation. It is also found in northern Algeria (Kabylie, coastal Algeria, Bouzaréa, and Oran) and the Hoggar Mountains of the Algerian Sahara, in Tunisia north of the Sahara, and Cyrenaica in Libya.

In western Asia, it is found along the eastern Mediterranean in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and western Jordan, and in the southern Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. It is also found south of the Caucasus in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and northeastern Turkey. On the Arabian Peninsula it occurs in Oman, Yemen including Socotra, and Asir province of Saudi Arabia. In central Asia, it inhabits the mountains of central Afghanistan, the lower Karakoram range in northern Pakistan and Ladakh, and Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and eastern Uzbekistan.

=== Environmental requirements ===

The caper bush requires a semiarid or arid climate. The caper bush has developed a series of mechanisms that reduce the impact of high radiation levels, high daily temperature, and insufficient soil water during its growing period.

In response to sudden increases in humidity, the bush forms wart-like pockmarks across the leaf surface. It quickly adjusts to the new conditions and produces unaffected leaves.

==Agriculture==
Capers can be grown easily from fresh seeds gathered from ripe fruit and planted into a well-drained seed-raising mix. Seedlings appear in two to four weeks. Old, stored seeds enter a state of dormancy and require cold stratification to germinate. The viable embryos germinate within three to four days after partial removal of the lignified seed coats. The seed coats and the mucilage surrounding the seeds may be ecological adaptations to avoid water loss and conserve seed viability during the dry season.

=== Orchard establishment ===
Mean annual temperatures in areas under cultivation are over . A rainy spring and a hot, dry summer are considered advantageous. This drought-tolerant perennial plant is used for landscaping and reducing erosion along highways, steep rocky slopes, dunes or fragile semiarid ecosystems.

=== Harvest ===
Caper buds are usually picked in the morning. Because the youngest, smallest buds fetch the highest prices, daily picking is typical.

Capers may be harvested from wild plants, in which case it is necessary to know that the plant is not one of the few poisonous &quot;Capparis&quot; species that look similar. The plant normally has curved thorns that may scratch the people who harvest the buds, although a few spineless varieties have been developed.

== Uses ==
=== Nutrition ===
Canned, pickled capers are 84% water, 5% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat. Preserved capers are particularly high in sodium due to the amount of salt added to the brine. In a typical serving of 28 grams (one ounce), capers supply 6 kcal and 35% of the Daily Value (DV) for sodium, with no other nutrients in significant content. In a 100-gram amount, the sodium content is 2960 mg or 197% DV, with vitamin K (23% DV), iron (13% DV), and riboflavin (12% DV) also having appreciable levels.

=== Culinary ===

The salted and pickled caper bud (simply called a &quot;caper&quot;) is used as an ingredient, seasoning, or garnish. Capers are a common ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine, especially Cypriot, Italian, Aeolian Greek, and Maltese food. The immature fruit of the caper shrub are prepared similarly and marketed as &quot;caper berries&quot;. Fully mature fruit are not preferred, as they contain many hard seeds.

The buds, when ready to pick, are a dark olive green and range in size from under to more than . They are picked, then pickled in salt or a salt and vinegar solution, and drained. Intense flavour, sometimes described as being similar to black pepper or mustard, is developed as glucocapparin, a glycoside organosulfur molecule, is released from each caper bud. This enzymatic reaction leads to the formation of rutin, often seen as crystallized white spots on the surfaces of individual caper buds.

Capers are a distinctive ingredient in Italian cuisine, especially in Sicilian, Aeolian and southern Italian cooking. They are commonly used in salads, pasta salads, meat dishes, and pasta sauces. Examples of uses in Italian cuisine are piccata dishes, vitello tonnato and &quot;spaghetti alla puttanesca&quot;.

Capers are sometimes an ingredient in tartar sauce. They are often served with cold smoked salmon or cured salmon dishes, especially lox and cream cheese. Capers and caper berries are sometimes substituted for olives to garnish a martini.

Capers are categorized and sold by their size, defined as follows, with the smallest sizes being the most desirable: non-pareil (up to 7 mm), surfines (7–8 mm), capucines (8–9 mm), capotes (9–11 mm), fines (11–13 mm), and grusas (14+ mm). If the caper bud is not picked, it flowers and produces a caper berry. The fruit can be pickled and then served as a Greek &quot;mezze&quot;.

Caper leaves, which are hard to find outside of Greece or Cyprus, are used particularly in salads and fish dishes. They are pickled or boiled and preserved in jars with brine—like caper buds.

Dried caper leaves are also used as a substitute for rennet in manufacturing high-quality cheese.

=== Polyphenols ===
Canned capers contain polyphenols, including the flavonoids quercetin (173 mg per 100 g) and kaempferol (131 mg per 100 g), as well as anthocyanins.

=== Other uses ===
Capers are sometimes used in cosmetics.

== History ==
Archaeobotanical evidence of capers has been found in the Mediterranean region and Mesopotamia as early as the upper Paleolithic period.

The caper was used in ancient Greece as a carminative. It is represented in archaeological levels in the form of carbonised seeds and rarely as flower buds and fruits from archaic and classical antiquity contexts. Athenaeus in &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; pays a lot of attention to the caper, as do Pliny (&quot;NH&quot; XIX, XLVIII.163) and Theophrastus.

Etymologically, the caper and its relatives in several European languages can be traced back to Classical Latin &quot;capparis&quot;, &quot;caper&quot;, in turn, borrowed from the Greek κάππαρις, &quot;kápparis&quot;, whose origin (as with that of the plant) is unknown but is probably Asian. Another theory links &quot;kápparis&quot; to the name of the island of Cyprus (Κύπρος, &quot;Kýpros&quot;), where capers grow abundantly.

In Biblical times, the caper berry was supposed to have aphrodisiac properties; the Hebrew word &quot;aviyyonah&quot; (אֲבִיּוֹנָה) for caperberry is closely linked to the Hebrew root אבה (avah), meaning &quot;desire&quot;.

The berries (&quot;abiyyonot&quot;) were eaten, as appears from their liability to tithes and the restrictions of the &#x27;Orlah. They are carefully distinguished in the Mishnah and the Talmud from the caper leaves, &quot;alin&quot;, shoots, &quot;temarot&quot;, and the caper buds, &quot;capperisin&quot; (note the similarity &quot;caper&quot;isin to &quot;caper&quot;); all of which were eaten as seen from the blessing requirement, and declared to be the fruit of the &quot;ẓelaf&quot; or caper plant.
The &quot;capperisin&quot; mentioned in the Talmud are actually referring to a shell that protected the &quot;abiyyonot&quot; as it grew.

Talmud Bavli discusses the eating of caper sepals versus caper berries, both in Israel and in Syria.

Capers are mentioned as a spice in the Roman cookbook &quot;Apicius&quot;.

In his 14th-century work &quot;Kaftor va-Ferach (Hebrew: כפתור ופרח)&quot;, Ishtori Haparchi notes that capers were grown in the Jordan Valley region.

<text>Sláine ( , ) is a comic hero that was first published in British magazine &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

Sláine is a barbarian fantasy adventure series based on Celtic myths and stories that first appeared in 1983, written by Pat Mills and initially drawn by his then wife, Angela Kincaid. Most of the early stories were drawn by Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon. Other notable artists to have worked on the character include Glenn Fabry, Simon Bisley, Clint Langley and Simon Davis.

Sláine&#x27;s favourite weapon is an axe called &quot;Brainbiter&quot;. He has the power of the &quot;warp spasm&quot;, based on the &quot;ríastrad&quot; or body-distorting battle frenzy of the Irish hero Cú Chulainn, in which earth power &quot;warps&quot; through his body, turning him into a terrifying, monstrously powerful figure. He is a devotee of the earth goddess Danu.

==Plot==
Sláine is a wanderer who is banished from his tribe, the Sessair. He explores the Land of the Young (Irish: &quot;Tír na nÓg&quot;) with an unscrupulous dwarf called Ukko, fighting monsters and mercenaries. In one early adventure he rescues a maiden, Medb, from being sacrificed in a wicker man, only to earn her enmity – she was a devotee of Crom Cruach, the god to whom she was to be sacrificed, and was looking forward to the experience. Her master and mentor, the ancient, rotting and insane Lord Weird Slough Feg, becomes the series&#x27; main villain.

Sláine encounters sky chariots (flying longships), dragons and prehistoric alien gods.

Sláine returns to his tribe and becomes king, leading them against the Fomorians, a race of sea demons who were oppressing them. In &quot;The Horned God&quot;, Sláine unites the tribes of the earth goddess against Slough Feg and his allies, while his personal devotion to the goddess leads to him becoming a new incarnation of the Horned God Carnun (based on the Gaulish deity Cernunnos). By the end of the story the Land of the Young is no more, and Sláine is the first High King of Ireland.
In subsequent stories, Sláine is sent through time by Danu to fight alongside other heroes and heroines such as Boudica (with whom he fought against the Romans, Elfric, and William Wallace), and returns to Ireland to defend his people against new enemies alongside his wife Niamh.

These new enemies turn out to be a full Fomorian invasion led by Balor and Moloch, murdering, raping, and eating their way through Sláine&#x27;s tribe until he is able to defeat Balor. The tribal council forces Sláine to let Moloch go, hoping he would fulfill his promise of keeping the Fomorians out of Ireland; instead, he returns to rape and murder Niamh. Wanting vengeance, Sláine abdicates the throne, and goes to Albion, killing Moloch. In his absence, his son Kai leaves the tribe to search for his father (eventually becoming a performer in an Albion carnival) and Ireland faces a second invasion – &quot;the dread of Europe&quot;, Atlanteans whose ancestors had lived in Ireland before the tribes of Danu, and who had been forcibly turned into hosts – &quot;Golamhs&quot; – for the symbiotic Sea Demons under Lord Odacon (an offshoot of the Fomorians). When Sláine returns, he finds the new High King Sethor, former member of the council who had granted Moloch freedom, was willing to surrender half of Ireland to Odacon in return for the gifts of science and civilisation.

Sláine convinces the tribal council that the demons could be killed and war is once more declared on the invaders, but it was clear that Ireland would be constantly attacked by wave after wave of Fomorian invasion. Sláine suggests having the Tribe of Danu escape to the Otherworld that their Sky Chariots had been sent to in order to free them from the demons, and allow the Atlanteans to settle peacefully in Ireland. Both armies unite against Odacon and his Sea Demons. Sláine is able to free the Atlantean leader Gael from being Odacon&#x27;s &quot;Golamh&quot; by handing over Sethor to take Gael&#x27;s place, and they lead their armies to bolster the city of Tara. While the tribes fight a defensive battle, Sláine is sent to the Otherworld to secure Danu&#x27;s blessings for the Tribes of the Earth Goddess to settle there. He returns with her power behind him and leads a charge that decimates Odacon&#x27;s forces. The Tribe is cast into the Otherworld in the aftermath, and Sláine assists Gael in finally destroying Odacon and the parasitic spawn with which he had infested the outer-lying villages.

With Gael as High King of Ireland and founder of the eventual Gaelic race, Sláine leaves to track down his son. He finds Kai at a travelling funfair, and later embarks on a quest to track down Crom Dubh.

==Sources and influences==
Sláine&#x27;s most obvious sources are Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Conan the Barbarian and Cú Chulainn, the hero of the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. Mills derived much of the series&#x27; background from Celtic mythology and European prehistory (as did Howard: the name Conan is Irish and is borne by a number of mythological figures). Sláine himself is named after Sláine mac Dela, the first High King of Ireland, and his &quot;warp-spasm&quot; or body-distorting battle frenzy is derived from the &quot;ríastrad&quot; of Cúchulainn; &quot;warp-spasm&quot; is the term Thomas Kinsella used for &quot;ríastrad&quot; in his translation of The &quot;Táin&quot;. His barbed spear, the &quot;gae bolga&quot;, is also borrowed from Cú Chulainn, though his favourite weapon, the axe, is more usually associated with the Vikings or Anglo-Saxons than the Celts.

His patronymic, Mac Roth, is the name of the steward of Ailill and Medb, king and queen of Connacht, in the same cycle. The death of Sláine&#x27;s mother, Macha, who was forced to run on foot in a chariot race because of her husband&#x27;s boasting, is taken from the story of an Irish goddess called Macha.

Sláine&#x27;s seduction of Niamh, the king&#x27;s chosen bride who was brought up in seclusion until she was of age, is reminiscent of the Irish story of Deirdre. Cathbad, the druid who foretells the evil consequences of Deirdre&#x27;s birth and appears in several other tales of the Ulster Cycle, gives his name to Sláine&#x27;s chief druid. Sláine&#x27;s feat of crossing a raging river to visit her, weighed down by a heavy stone to prevent him from being swept away, is taken from an episode of the &quot;Táin&quot;. Niamh is a popular Irish girl&#x27;s name, and is also the name of a fairy queen from the Fenian Cycle. Her otherworld homeland, &quot;Tír na nÓg&quot; (the Land of the Young), provides the name of the series&#x27; setting.

Sláine&#x27;s goddess, Danu, and her tribes, the Tuatha Dé Danann, come from the Irish Mythological Cycle, though the worship of a universal mother goddess of the earth is not Celtic, and comes from speculations about prehistoric European culture and religion by people like Marija Gimbutas and Robert Graves. The Horned God, Carnun, is adapted from the Gaulish antlered deity Cernunnos. Some of the religious ideas in the series are taken from &quot;Barddas&quot;, a possibly fraudulent compilation of &quot;bardo-druidic&quot; beliefs by the 18th-century Welsh antiquarian Iolo Morganwg. Mills divides the priests of Tir na nÓg into two factions: the good Druids, the well known priestly class of Celtic Europe, and the evil Drunes, whose name derives from the Galatian place-name Drunemeton (&quot;oak-sanctuary&quot;) used in the story &quot;The Bride of Crom&quot; as the name of the Drunes&#x27; capital. Their leader, Slough Feg, is partly based on Cernunnos and partly on the paleolithic cave painting known as the Sorcerer in the &quot;Trois-Frères&quot; cave in Ariège, southern France. His acolyte, Medb, is named after the legendary queen of Connacht from the Ulster Cycle. The Drunes&#x27; god, Crom Cruach, is an Irish deity who was reputedly appeased with human sacrifices. The practice of mass human sacrifice by burning in a wicker man is mentioned as a practice of the Celts of Gaul by Strabo and Julius Caesar.

The enemies of the Tribes of the Earth Goddess, the Fomorians, and their leader Balor, are from the Irish mythological cycle.

Other elements of the series are derived from non-Celtic mythological sources. Sláine&#x27;s dwarf companion is named Ukko, after the Finnish storm god. Odacon is identified in Theosophist circles with a Babylonian deity named Oannes, and is considered closely related to Dagon. Musarus, one of the same species as Odacon, shares this origin. Grimnismal, the name of the dark god Sláine and his companions defeat in &quot;Tomb of Terror&quot;, is the title of a poem about Odin from the Norse Elder Edda. The term Ragnarok, for the end of the world, is also borrowed from Norse mythology.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
*Sláine MacRoth – Mighty black-haired Irish warrior exiled from the Sessair tribe for having an affair with the chief&#x27;s fiancée Niamh. He loves fighting and often beats up Ukko. His favoured weapon is the stone axe Brainbiter and he first experienced the Warp Spasm as a child.
*Ukko – Sláine&#x27;s dwarf sidekick and chronicler, named after the Finnish storm-god Ukko. He is lecherous and greedy; like most fantasy dwarves he loves gold and has a business mind centuries ahead of the human characters. When Sláine becomes king, Ukko is appointed his &quot;Royal Parasite&quot; – his jester.
*Nest – Druidess who urges Ukko to record Sláine&#x27;s deeds. She frequently quarrels with Ukko, but it is hinted there may be some mutual attraction between them.
*Niamh – Slaine&#x27;s strong-willed wife. She is very assertive, and prone to anger and jealousy, often beating up Sláine&#x27;s other wives and concubines

===Supporting characters===
*Danu – Goddess of the earth who provides Slaine with guidance. Originally earth was ruled by female goddesses but the druids suppressed them and replaced them with male counterparts
*Cathbad – Chief druid who wears a horse skull and has a strong dislike of Ukko. He is a short old man with a moustache and bald head, save for a single tuft of hair.
*Myrddin – Half-Cythron Atlantean survivor and high-level magus analogous to Merlin. His fortress is located in modern-day Wales.
*Murdach – Time-displaced son of Brian Boru.
*Kai – Sláine&#x27;s son. Sláine wanted him to be a warrior but Niamh had him train as a druid. He later becomes a travelling acrobat.
*King Rudraige mac Dela – Ruler of the city of Gorlias and guardian of the Silver Sword of the Moon. His hand is bitten off by Avagddu and replaced with a metal prosthesis, preventing him from becoming High King. He was married to Niamh for a year, but leaves her for a warrior resembling Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s Conan.
*King Gann mac Dela – Ruler of Finias and wielder of the Spear of the Flaming Sun. To celebrate the defeat of the Fomorians Gann was sacrificed and eaten by the tribe
*King Sengann mac Dela – Mad ruler of Falias, a moon-worshipping society. His people, the black-skinned Tribe of the Shadows, were responsible for exterminating the Neanderthal-like beaver folk and stealing the Stone of Destiny.
*Mogrooth – Fearsome Atlantean dragon rider and gladiator with enlarged, sharpened fangs. Despises Ukko for his thievery.
*Tlachtga – Mogrooth&#x27;s daughter and one of Myrddin&#x27;s best warriors. She is badly disfigured by the Great Worm&#x27;s breath, which aged part of her face.

===Villains===
*The Lord Weird Slough Feg – Ancient, rotting leader of the Drunes and the original Horned God who refused to die when his seven-year reign was over. He ate the Time Worm&#x27;s eggs to prolong his life and resides at the drune capital Carnac where he spends his time making cave paintings.
*Medb/Megrim – Drune priestess saved by Slaine from human sacrifice. It is revealed she wanted to be sacrificed to the worm-god Crom to become a goddess.
*Catha, Fea, and Nemon – Three Drune priestesses who serve as Slough Feg&#x27;s lieutenants.
*Melga – Slough Feg&#x27;s general, oversaw the construction of the standing stones at Carnac.
*Balor – Leader of the Fomorians. He has only one eye, which is capable of destroying anything he stares at.
*Moloch – Balor&#x27;s cruel lieutenant, who wields six swords in battle. Based on the pagan god Molech. Assumes command of the Fomorians when Balor is killed, and brutally murders Niamh.
*Odacon – Assumes control of the Fomorians after Moloch.
*Sethor – Member of Sessair tribal council who succeeded Sláine as High King. He later betrays the Celts to the Fomorians and becomes Odacon&#x27;s golamh.
*Avagddu – The demon son of the earth goddess, and the foulest, stupidest demon ever to have lived. Medb summoned him to kill Niamh but he ended up eating himself.
*Elfric – Three-eyed blue skinned demon capable of time travel. He led both the Roman invasion of Britain and the Viking invasion of Ireland. He appears to be homosexual or bisexual as he refers to his relationship with Nero and was reluctant to rape Boudicca&#x27;s daughters, only doing so out of spite.
*Quagslime – Fomorian tax collector who cuts off the noses of tax-dodgers.
*Nudd – Ogre serving as assistant jailer. Slaine bashed out his brains when Nudd tried to kill him.
*Domnall – A dwarf blacksmith who murdered warriors and tempered his weapons in their blood. He is killed with his own sword by Slaine.
*Slough Throt – A drune lord who successfully sheds his rotting skin to earn the rank of Slough. He hired Sláine as a bodyguard to escape Slough Feg and deliver the plans for Ragnarok to the Druids of Glastonbury.
*Cador – An ancient Druid who built the forcefield that protects Myrddin&#x27;s territory from the Cythrons. Was killed and replaced by a disguised Slough Feg at some unspecified point in Time Killers.

*Hengwolf – Anglo-Saxon warlord and worshipper of Odin allied to Mordred, who transforms into the white dragon of the Saxons and battles Sláine
*Guledig – Cythron leader who orchestrated Arthur&#x27;s downfall. He is worshipped by the Celts as a statue of a golden child called the Mabon, but his real form is a green disembodied head with three arms

<doc id="309323" wikidata="Q742753" url="?curid=309323" title="Bambi, a Life in the Woods">
<text>Bambi, a Life in the Woods () is a 1923 Austrian coming-of-age novel written by Felix Salten, and originally published in Berlin by Ullstein Verlag. The novel traces the life of Bambi, a male roe deer, from his birth through childhood, the loss of his mother, the finding of a mate, the lessons he learns from his father, and the experience he gains about the dangers posed by human hunters in the forest. It is also, in its most complete translation, seen as a parable of the dangers and persecution faced by Jews in Europe.

An English translation by Whittaker Chambers was published in North America by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1928, and the novel has since been translated and published in over thirty languages around the world. Salten published a sequel, &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Children&quot;, in 1939.

The novel was well received by critics and is considered a classic, as well as one of the first environmental novels. It was adapted into an animated feature film, &quot;Bambi&quot;, by Walt Disney Productions in 1942, as well as two Russian live-action adaptations in 1985 and 1986, a ballet in 1987, and a stage production in 1998. Another ballet adaptation was created by an Oregon troupe, but never premiered. Janet Schulman published a children&#x27;s picture book adaptation in 2000 that featured realistic oil paintings and many of Salten&#x27;s original words.

==Plot==

Bambi is a roe deer fawn born in a thicket in late spring. Over the course of the summer, his mother teaches him about the various inhabitants of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow, which he learns is a wonderful but also dangerous place, as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother&#x27;s caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.

As Bambi grows older, his mother begins to leave him alone. While searching for her one day, Bambi has his first encounter with &quot;He&quot;the animals&#x27; term for humanswhich terrifies him. The man raises a firearm and aims at him; Bambi flees at top speed, joined by his mother. After he is scolded by a stag for crying for his mother, Bambi gets used to being alone at times. He later learns the stag is called the &quot;Old Prince&quot;, the oldest and largest stag in the forest, who is known for his cunning and aloof nature. During the winter, Bambi meets Marena, a young doe, Nettla, an old doe who no longer bears young, and two princes, Ronno and Karus. Mid-winter, hunters enter the forest, killing many animals including Bambi&#x27;s mother. Gobo also disappears and is presumed dead.

After this, the novel skips ahead a year, noting that Bambi, now a young adult, was cared for by Nettla and that when he got his first set of antlers he was abused and harassed by the other males. It is summer and Bambi is now sporting his second set of antlers. He is reunited with his cousin Faline. After he battles and defeats first Karus, then Ronno, Bambi and Faline fall in love with each other. They spend a great deal of time together. During this time, the Old Prince saves Bambi&#x27;s life when he nearly runs towards a hunter imitating a doe&#x27;s call. This teaches the young buck to be cautious about blindly rushing toward any deer&#x27;s call. During the summer, Gobo returns to the forest, having been raised by a man who found him collapsed in the snow during the hunt where Bambi&#x27;s mother was killed. While his mother and Marena welcome him and celebrate him as a &quot;friend&quot; of man, the Old Prince and Bambi pity him. Marena becomes his mate, but several weeks later Gobo is killed when he approaches a hunter in the meadow, falsely believing the halter he wore would keep him safe from all men.

As Bambi continues to mature, he begins spending most of his time alone, including avoiding Faline though he still loves her in a melancholic way. Several times he meets with the Old Prince, who teaches him about snares, shows him how to free another animal from one, and encourages him not to use trails and avoid the men&#x27;s traps. When Bambi is later shot by a hunter, the Prince shows him how to walk in circles to confuse the man and his dogs until the bleeding stops, then takes him to a safe place to recover. They remain together until Bambi is strong enough to leave the safe haven again. When Bambi has grown gray and is &quot;old&quot;, the Old Prince shows him that men are not all-powerful by showing him the dead body of a man who was shot and killed by another man. When Bambi confirms that he now understands that &quot;He&quot; is not all-powerful, and that there is &quot;Another&quot; over all creatures, the stag tells him that he has always loved him and calls him &quot;my son&quot; before leaving.

At the end of the novel, Bambi meets with twin fawns who are calling for their mother, and he scolds them for not being able to stay alone. After leaving them, he thinks to himself that the girl fawn reminded him of Faline, and that the male was promising, and that Bambi hoped to meet him again when he was grown.

==Publication history==
Felix Salten, himself an avid hunter, penned &quot;Bambi: Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde&quot; after World War I, targeting an adult audience. The novel was first published in Vienna in serialized form in the newspaper the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; from 15 August to 21 October 1922, and as a book in Germany by Ullstein Verlag in 1923, and republished in 1926 in Vienna.

===Translations===
Max Schuster, a German Jewish émigré and co-founder of Simon &amp; Schuster, led the effort to publish &quot;Bambi&quot; in English. Clifton Fadiman, an editor there, engaged his Columbia University classmate Whittaker Chambers to translate it. Simon &amp; Schuster published this first English edition in 1928, with illustrations by Kurt Wiese, under the title &quot;Bambi: A Life in the Woods&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review praised the prose as &quot;admirably translated&quot; that made the book &quot;literature of a high order.&quot; The translation immediately became &quot;a Book-of-the-Month Club hit.&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster printed a first-run of 75,000 copies and sold more than 650,000 copies between 1928 and 1942. (Jonathan Cape published the Chambers translation in the UK starting also in 1928, with a foreword by John Galsworthy).

Chambers&#x27; translation has been reprinted repeatedly with different illustrations. &quot;Bambi&quot;, along with Salten&#x27;s &quot;Fifteen Rabbits&quot; and &quot;The City Jungle&quot;, all translated by Chambers, remain in print from Simon &amp; Schuster.

In 2015, an Austrian scholar voiced objections to Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s &quot;publication strategies&quot; and &quot;marketing strategy,&quot; as well as Chambers&#x27; translation for &quot;opening the possibility for the story to be understood less as a human story about persecution, expulsion or assimilation and more as an animal story conveying a strong message about the protection of animals and the necessity of conservation.&quot;

A translation by Hannah Correll was published in 2019 by Clydesdale Press. A translation by David Wyllie was published in 2020 through Project Gutenberg.

A translation by Jack Zipes was published in 2022 by Princeton University Press. Zipes commented the conversation between animals is &quot;reminiscent of Austrian German you&#x27;d hear in cafes around Vienna. The original translation didn&#x27;t capture that and I hope mine does,&quot; while a grandson of Chambers countered that the 1928 translation is more poetic. One reviewer wrote:

Chambers and Zipes differ moderately in style, with Zipes cleaving more faithfully to the German (&quot;polecat&quot;) and Chambers privileging his American audience (&quot;ferret&quot;). An aim of Zipes&#x27; translation is to restore Salten&#x27;s more overt anthropomorphism, which Chambers softened. To a reader familiar with the 1928 translation, some of Zipes&#x27; more faithful anthropomorphic choices are jarring; it feels odd to read that a fawn &quot;yelled,&quot; for example.

Zipes occasionally increases the anthropomorphism beyond that suggested by Salten, as when he uses the pronouns &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; in a conversation between two autumn leaves, which are genderless in the original text. The Zipes translation is also not quite complete: one reviewer noted omissions ranging from short phrases and individual sentences to an entire passage recounting Bambi&#x27;s first meeting with the old roebucks. A translation by Damion Searls was published in 2022 by &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. The translations have been reviewed in various newspapers and magazines.

===Formats===
Over 200 editions of the novel have been published, with almost 100 German and English editions alone, and numerous translations and reprintings in over 30 languages. It has also been published in a variety of formats, including printed medium, audiobook, Braille, and E-book formats.

===Copyright dispute===
When Salten originally published &quot;Bambi&quot; in 1923, he did so under Germany&#x27;s copyright laws, which required no statement that the novel was copyrighted. In the 1926 republication, he did include a United States copyright notice, so the work is considered to have been copyrighted in the United States in 1926. In 1936, Salten sold some film rights to the novel to MGM producer Sidney Franklin who passed them on to Walt Disney for the creation of a film adaptation. After Salten&#x27;s death in 1945, his daughter Anna Wyler inherited the copyright and renewed the novel&#x27;s copyrighted status in 1954 (U.S. copyright law in effect at the time provided for an initial term of 28 years from the date of first publication in the U.S., which could be extended for an additional 28 years provided the copyright holder filed for renewal before the expiration of the initial copyright). In 1958, she formulated three agreements with Disney regarding the novel&#x27;s rights. Upon her death in 1977, the rights passed to her husband, Veit Wyler, and her children, who held on to them until 1993 when he sold the rights to the publishing house Twin Books. Twin Books and Disney disagreed on the terms and validity of Disney&#x27;s original contract with Anna Wyler and Disney&#x27;s continued use of the Bambi name.

When the two companies were unable to reach a solution, Twin Books filed suit against Disney for copyright infringement. Disney argued that because Salten&#x27;s original 1923 publication of the novel did not include a copyright notice, by American law it was immediately considered a public domain work. It also argued that as the novel was published in 1923, Anna Wyler&#x27;s 1954 renewal occurred after the deadline and was invalid. The case was reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which ruled that the novel was copyrighted upon its publication in 1923, and not a public domain work then. However, in validating 1923 as the publication date, this confirmed Disney&#x27;s claim that the copyright renewal was filed too late and the novel became a public domain work in 1951.

Twin Books appealed the decision, and in March 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the original decision, stating that the novel was a foreign work in 1923 that was not in its home country&#x27;s public domain when published, therefore the original publication date could not be used in arguing American copyright law. Instead, the 1926 publication date, the first in which it specifically declared itself to be copyrighted in the United States, is considered the year when the novel was copyrighted in America. Anna Wyler&#x27;s renewal was therefore timely and valid, and Twin Books&#x27; ownership of the copyright was upheld.

The &quot;Twin Books&quot; decision is still regarded as controversial by many copyright experts. David Nimmer, in a 1998 article, argued that the &quot;Twin Books&quot; ruling meant that an ancient Greek epic, if only published outside the U.S. without the required formalities, would be eligible for copyright protection. Although Nimmer concluded that &quot;Twin Books&quot; required this finding (within the Ninth Circuit), he characterized the result as &quot;patently absurd.&quot;

The American copyright of the novel expired on January 1, 2022. In Austria and other countries of the European Union, the novel entered the public domain on January 1, 2016.

===Sequel===
While living in exile in Switzerland, after being forced to flee Nazi-occupied Austria, Salten wrote a sequel to &quot;Bambi&quot; that follows the birth and lives of Bambi&#x27;s twin offspring, Geno and Gurri. The young fawns interact with other deer, and are educated and watched over by Bambi and Faline as they grow. They also learn more about the ways of man, including both hunters and the gamekeeper seeking to protect the deer. Due to Salten&#x27;s exiled statushe had lost his Austrian publisher Paul Zsolnay Verlagthe English translation of the novel was published first, in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs-Merrill; it would take a year before the sequel was published in the original German language in Switzerland by his new publisher.

==Reception==
In the United States, the 1928 translation of &quot;Bambi&quot; was &quot;hugely popular&quot;, selling 650,000 copies by 1942. When Felix Salten visited the United States as a member of a European delegation of journalists in May–July 1930, he was greeted warmly because of &quot;Bambi&quot; wherever the delegation went, as was testified by the Finnish member of the delegation, Urho Toivola. In his own travel book, Salten did not boast about this; only when describing his visit to a &quot;Negro college&quot; of Atlanta, he mentions passingly that the children praised his books.

In 1936 Nazi Germany however, the government banned the original as &quot;political allegory on the treatment of Jews in Europe.&quot; Many copies of the novel were burned, making original first editions rare and difficult to find.

In his foreword, John Galsworthy called it a &quot;delicious bookdelicious not only for children but for those who are no longer so fortunate&quot; and a &quot;little masterpiece&quot; that shows a &quot;delicacy of perception and essential truth&quot;. He observed that while reading the galley proof of the novel while crossing the English Channel, he, his wife, and his nephew read each page in turn over the course of three hours in &quot;silent absorption&quot;.

Among US reviewers, &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer John Chamberlain praised Salten&#x27;s &quot;tender, lucid style&quot; that &quot;takes you out of yourself&quot;. He felt that Salten captured the essence of each of the creatures as they talked, catching the &quot;rhythm of the different beings who people his forest world&quot; and showed particular &quot;comprehension&quot; in detailing the various stages of Bambi&#x27;s life. He also considered the English translation &quot;admirably&quot; done. A reviewer for &quot;Catholic World&quot; praised the approach of the subject, noting that it was &quot;marked by poetry and sympathy [with] charming reminders of German folklore and fairy tale&quot; but disliked the &quot;transference of certain human ideals to the animal mind&quot; and the vague references to religious allegory. The &quot;Boston Transcript&quot; called it a &quot;sensitive allegory of life&quot;. The &quot;Saturday Review&quot; considered it &quot;beautiful and graceful&quot; piece that showed a rare &quot;individuality&quot;. Isabel Ely Lord, reviewing the novel for the &quot;American Journal of Nursing&quot;, called the novel a &quot;delightful animal story&quot; and Salten a &quot;poet&quot; whose &quot;picture of the woods and its people is an unforgettable one.&quot; In comparing &quot;Bambi&quot; to Salten&#x27;s later work &quot;Perri&quot;in which Bambi makes a brief cameoLouise Long of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; considered both to be stories that &quot;quietly and completely [captivate] the heart&quot;. Long felt the prose was &quot;poised and mobile and beautiful as poetry&quot; and praises Salten for his ability to give the animals seemingly human speech while not &quot;[violating] their essential natures.&quot; Vicky Smith of &quot;Horn Book Magazine&quot; felt the novel was gory compared to the later Disney adaptation and called it a &quot;weeper&quot;. While criticizing it as one of the most esteemable anti-hunting novels available, she concedes the novel is not easily forgettable and praises the &quot;linchpin scene&quot; where Bambi&#x27;s mother dies, stating &quot;the understated conclusion of that scene, &#x27;Bambi never saw his mother again,&#x27; masterfully evokes an uncomplicated emotional response&quot;. She questions Galsworthy&#x27;s recommendation of the novel to sportsmen in the foreword, wondering &quot;how many budding sportsmen might have had conversion experiences in the face of Salten&#x27;s unrelieved harangue and how many might have instead become alienated.&quot; In comparing the novel to the Disney film, Steve Chapple of &quot;Sports Afield&quot; felt that Salten viewed Bambi&#x27;s forest as a &quot;pretty scary place&quot; and the novel as a whole had a &quot;lot of dark adult undertones&quot;. Interpreting it as an allegory for Salten&#x27;s own life, Chapple felt Salten came across as &quot;a little morbid, a bleeding heart of a European intellectual.&quot; A half century later,&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s James P. Sterba also considered it an &quot;antifascist allegory&quot; and sarcastically notes that &quot;you&#x27;ll find it in the children&#x27;s section at the library, a perfect place for this 293-page volume, packed as it is with blood-and-guts action, sexual conquest and betrayal&quot; and &quot;a forest full of cutthroats and miscreants. I count at least six murderers (including three child-killers) among Bambi&#x27;s associates.&quot;

Among UK reviews, the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; stated that the novel is a &quot;tale of exceptional charm, though untrustworthy of some of the facts of animal life.&quot;

==Impact==
Some critics have argued that &quot;Bambi&quot; is one of the first environmental novels.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
====Walt Disney animated film====
With World War II looming, Max Schuster aided the Jewish Salten&#x27;s flight from Nazi controlled Austria and Nazi Germany and helped introduce him, and &quot;Bambi&quot;, to Walt Disney Productions. Sidney Franklin, a producer and director at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, purchased the film rights in 1933, initially desiring to make a live-action adaptation of the work. Deciding such a film would be too difficult to make, he sold the rights to Walt Disney in April 1937 in hopes of it being adapted into an animated film instead. Disney began working on the film immediately, intending it to be the company&#x27;s second feature-length animated film and his first to be based on a specific, recent work.

The original novel, written for an adult audience, was considered too &quot;grim&quot; and &quot;somber&quot; for the young audience Disney was targeting, and with the work required to adapt the novel, Disney put production on hold while it worked on several other projects. In 1938, Disney assigned Perce Pearce and Carl Fallberg to develop the film&#x27;s storyboards, but attention was soon drawn away as the studio began working on &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Finally, on 17 August 1939, production on &quot;Bambi&quot; began in earnest, although it progressed slowly due to changes in the studio personnel, location and the methodology of handling animation at the time. The writing was completed in July 1940, by which time the film&#x27;s budget had swelled to $858,000. Disney was later forced to slash 12 minutes from the film before final animation, to save costs on production.

Heavily modified from the original novel, &quot;Bambi&quot; was released to theaters in the United States on 8 August 1942. Disney&#x27;s version severely downplays the naturalistic and environmental elements found in the novel, giving it a lighter, friendlier feeling. The addition of two new characters, Thumper the Rabbit and Flower the Skunk, two sweet and gentle forest creatures, contributed to giving the film the desired levity. Considered a classic, the film has been called &quot;the crowning achievement of Walt Disney&#x27;s animation studio&quot; and was named as the third best film in the animation genre of the AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 &quot;classic&quot; American film genres.

===== Direct-to-video sequel =====
On February 7, 2006, Disneytoon Studios, a Disney Animation division known for direct-to-video and occasional theatrical animated feature films, released a follow-up to the film, titled &quot;Bambi II&quot;. It takes place between the death of Bambi&#x27;s mother and Bambi shown as a young adult buck, and shows the relationship between Bambi and his father, the Great Prince of the Forest. While &quot;Bambi II&quot; was released direct-to-video in the United States, it was released theatrically in Argentina on January 26, 2006.

===== Computer-animated remake =====
On January 28, 2020, a computer-animated remake of the Disney film was announced to be in development with a script co-written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Lindsey Beer while Paul Weitz, Chris Weitz, and Andrew Miano will produce the film. On June 13, 2023, it was revealed that Sarah Polley is in talks to direct the film, which is said to be a musical that will feature music from six-time Grammy-winning country star Kacey Musgraves. Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster wrote the most recent draft of the script. On September 29, 2023, it was announced that the film will not show the death of Bambi&#x27;s mother due to the trauma it brought certain children.

====Russian live-action films====
In 1985, a Russian-language live-action adaptation, &quot;Detstvo Bembi&quot; (, lit. &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Childhood&quot;), was produced in the Soviet Union by Gorky Film Studios. It was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk, who also co-wrote the script with Yuri Nagibin, and featured music by Boris Petrov. Natalya&#x27;s son and her husband Nikolay Burlyaev starred as the young and adolescent Bambi, respectively, while Faline (renamed Falina) was portrayed by Yekaterina Lychyova as a child and Galina Belyayeva as an adult. Bondarchuk herself portray Bambi&#x27;s mother. In this adaptation, the film starts using animals, changes to using human actors, then returns to using animals for the ending.

A sequel, &quot;Yunost Bembi&quot; (, lit. &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Youth&quot;), followed in 1986 with Nikolay and Galina reprising their voice roles as Bambi and Falina. Featuring over 100 species of live animals and filmed in various locations in Crimea, Mount Elbrus, Latvia and Czechoslovakia, the film follows new lovers Bambi and Felina as they go on a journey in search of a life-giving flower. Both films were released to Region 2 DVD with Russian and English subtitle options by the Russian Cinema Council in 2000. The first film&#x27;s DVD also included a French audio soundtrack, while the second contained French subtitles instead.

====French live-action film====
A French-language live-action film, &quot;Bambi, l’histoire d’une vie dans les bois&quot;, directed and written by Michel Fessler, was released in 2024. It used live animals and starred Mylène Farmer as voice of narrator.

====Animated film====
An animated adaption of the novel is set for release on Blu-ray 3D by Variety Films on February 15, 2025. It will also be made available on a 4K3D disc which includes the 3D version in 2160p in over/under 3D format. This is the world&#x27;s first narrative film and first animated film to be made available in a 4K3D format on Blu-ray.

====Horror film====
On November 21, 2022, a British live-action horror film, titled &quot;&quot;, was announced to be in development for ITN Studios and Jagged Edge Productions with Scott Jeffrey directing and Rhys Frake-Waterfield producing, with it being set in the same universe as &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot;, known as the Twisted Childhood Universe (TCU). The film will be about the titular character getting revenge after the death of his mother. The film will star Roxanne McKee as Xana, who will reprise her role in the TCU&#x27;s first crossover film, &quot;Poohniverse: Monsters Assemble&quot; alongside Scott Chambers as Christopher Robin.

===Ballet===
The Estonian composer Lydia Auster composed the ballet &quot;Bambi&quot; in 1986 which was premièred in Tartu, Vanemuine theater, in 1987.

The Oregon Ballet Theatre adapted &quot;Bambi&quot; into an evening-length ballet entitled &quot;Bambi: Lord of the Forest&quot;. It was slated to premiere in March 2000 as the main production for the company&#x27;s 2000–2001 season. A collaboration between artistic director James Canfield and composer Thomas Lauderdale, the ballet&#x27;s production was to be an interpretation of the novel rather than the Disney film. In discussing the adaptation, Canfield stated that he was given a copy of the novel as a Christmas present and found it to be a &quot;classic story about coming of age and a life cycle.&quot; He went on to note that the play was inspired solely by the novel and not the Disney film. After the initial announcements, the pair began calling the work &quot;The Collaboration&quot;, as Disney owns the licensing rights for the name &quot;Bambi&quot; and they did not wish to fight for usage rights. The local press began calling the ballet alternative titles, including &quot;Not-Bambi&quot; which Canfield noted to be his favorite, out of derision at Disney. Its premiere was delayed for unexplained reasons, and it has yet to be performed.

===Theater===
Playwright James DeVita, of the First Stage Children&#x27;s Theater, created a stage adaptation of the novel. The script was published by Anchorage Press Plays on 1 June 1997. Crafted for young adults and teenagers and retaining the title &quot;BambiA Life in the Woods&quot;, it has been produced around the United States at various venues. The script calls for an open-stage setup, and utilizes at least nine actors: five male and four female, to cover the thirteen roles. The American Alliance Theatre and Education awarded the work its &quot;Distinguished Play Award&quot; for an adaptation.

===Book===
In 1999, the novel was adapted into an illustrated hardback children&#x27;s book by Janet Schulman, illustrated by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher, and published by Simon &amp; Schuster as part of its &quot;Atheneum Books for Young Readers&quot; imprint. In the adaptation, Schulman attempted to retain some of the lyrical feel of the original novel. She notes that rather than rewrite the novel, she &quot;replicated Salten&#x27;s language almost completely. I reread the novel a number of times and then I went through and highlighted the dialogue and poignant sentences Salten had written.&quot; Doing so retained much of the novel&#x27;s original lyrical feel, though the book&#x27;s brevity did result in a sacrifice of some of the &quot;majesty and mystery&quot; found in the novel. The illustrations were created to appear as realistic as possible, using painted images rather than sketches. In 2002, the Schulman adaptation was released in audiobook format by Audio Bookshelf, with Frank Dolan as the reader.

<text>Phelsuma comorensis, commonly known as the Comoros day gecko, is a species of gecko endemic to the island of Grande Comore, Comoros. It typically dwells on trees, and feeds on insects and nectar.

==Description==
This lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a maximum length of about . The body colour is olive green or pale green. A rost-coloured stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. A black lateral stripe extends from the eye to the hind leg. On the lower back there are brownish or red-brick coloured dots. The legs have dark spots.

==Distribution==
This species is only known from the island Grande Comore. It is found in higher areas (600 meters and upwards). It is not currently endangered.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. comorensis&quot; is often found on a variety of pantropic vegetation.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Reproduction==
The females are very productive and lay up to 8 pairs of eggs per year. Juveniles reach sexual maturity after only 4–5 months.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need an enclosure with live plants and vertical bamboo shoots. The temperature should be between and during the day with a 6-7 °C drop during the night. A good air flow is important. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>The River Piddle or Trent or North River is a small rural Dorset river which rises in the Dorset Downs and flows into Poole Harbour near Wareham.

==Etymology==
The river&#x27;s name has Germanic origins and has had various spellings over the years. In AD 966 it was called the &#x27;Pidelen&#x27;, and on the church tower at Piddletrenthide—the first village to which it gives its name—it is spelled &#x27;Pydel&#x27;. Several villages which the river passes through are named after it: as well as Piddletrenthide there are Piddlehinton, Puddletown, Tolpuddle, Affpuddle, Briantspuddle and Turnerspuddle. Local legend tells that the Victorians changed the spelling to &#x27;Puddle&#x27;, due to &#x27;piddle&#x27; being a slang term for &#x27;urine&#x27; (although Puddletown was still called Piddletown into the 1950s), but see for instance the John Speed map of the county from 1610 which has the name &#x27;Puddletown&#x27;.

==Course and characteristics==
In its upper reaches, the Piddle is a chalk stream flowing south through a steep valley cut into the dip slope of the downland, which is dominated by an agricultural landscape of calcareous grassland pasture and arable fields. It rises above the church in Alton Pancras, which was originally named Awultune, a Saxon name meaning the village at the source of a river.

At Puddletown, south of the source, the chalk dips below clay and alluvial sand and gravel geology with a flatter landscape of water-meadows. Here, the Piddle turns to follow an east-south-easterly direction to Wareham, where it enters Poole Harbour via Wareham Channel. This section of the river runs more or less parallel with its bigger neighbour, the River Frome, together forming a broad, open valley divided by a low ridge of heathland.

==Cultural references==
Thomas Hardy was born and raised in a cottage at Higher Bockhampton on the ridge between the Piddle and Frome valleys, and the landscape and villages of the valley were inspiration for many of the places in his stories, including Athelhampton House (&quot;Athelhall&quot;) and Puddletown (&quot;Weatherbury&quot;).

The Piddle Valley was the subject of Ogden Nash&#x27;s poem &quot;Paradise For Sale&quot;, published in the New Yorker in 1959.

<doc id="309330" wikidata="Q806853" url="?curid=309330" title="Herem (censure)">
<text>Herem ( &quot;ḥērem&quot;) is the highest ecclesiastical censure in the Jewish community. It is the total exclusion of a person from the Jewish community. It is a form of shunning and is similar to &quot;vitandus&quot; &quot;excommunication&quot; in the Catholic Church. Cognate terms in other Semitic languages include the Arabic terms &quot;ḥarām&quot; &quot;forbidden, taboo, off-limits, or immoral&quot; and haram &quot;set apart, sanctuary&quot;, and the Ge&#x27;ez word &quot;ʿirm&quot; &quot;accursed&quot;.

== Summary ==
Although developed from the biblical ban, excommunication, as employed by the rabbis during Talmudic times and during the Middle Ages, became a rabbinic institution, the object of which was to preserve Jewish solidarity. A system of laws was gradually developed by rabbis, by means of which this power was limited, so that it became one of the modes of legal punishment by rabbinic courts. While it did not entirely lose its arbitrary character, since individuals were allowed to pronounce the ban of excommunication on particular occasions, it became chiefly a legal measure resorted to by a judicial court for certain prescribed offenses.

== Etymology and cognate terms ==
The three terms &quot;herem&quot;, &quot;censure, excommunication&quot;, &quot;devotion of enemies by annihilation&quot; in the Tanakh, and &quot;devotion of property to a kohen&quot;, are all English transliterations of the same Hebrew noun. This noun comes from the semitic root Ḥ-R-M. There is also a homonym &quot;herem&quot; &quot;fisherman&#x27;s net&quot;, which appears nine times in the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh, that has no etymological connection to &quot;herem&quot;.

The Talmudic usage of &quot;herem&quot; for excommunication can be distinguished from the usage of &quot;herem&quot; described in the Tanakh in the time of Joshua and the early Hebrew monarchy, which was the practice of consecration by total annihilation at the command of God carried out against peoples such as the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the entire population of Jericho. The neglect of Saul to carry out such a command as delivered by Samuel resulted in the selection of David as his replacement.

== Offenses ==
The Talmud speaks of twenty-four offenses that, in theory, were punishable by a form of &quot;niddui&quot; or temporary excommunication. Maimonides (as well as later authorities) enumerates the twenty-four as follows:
# insulting a learned man, even after his death;
# insulting a messenger of the court;
# calling a fellow Jew a &quot;slave&quot;;
# refusing to appear before the court at the appointed time;
# dealing lightly with any of the rabbinic or Mosaic precepts;
# refusing to abide by a decision of the court;
# keeping in one&#x27;s possession an animal or an object that may prove injurious to others, such as a savage dog or a broken ladder;
# selling one&#x27;s real estate to a non-Jew without assuming the responsibility for any injury that the non-Jew may cause his neighbors;
# testifying against one&#x27;s Jewish neighbor in a non-Jewish court, and thereby causing that neighbor to lose money which he would not have lost had the case been decided in a Jewish court;
# a kohen shochet (butcher) who refuses to give the foreleg, cheeks and maw of kosher-slaughtered livestock to another kohen;
# violating the second day of a holiday, even though its observance is only a custom;
# performing work on the afternoon of the day preceding Passover;
# taking the name of God in vain;
# causing others to profane the name of God;
# causing others to eat holy meat outside of Jerusalem;
# making calculations for the calendar, and establishing festivals accordingly, outside of Israel;
# putting a stumbling-block in the way of the blind, that is to say, tempting another to sin (Lifnei iver);
# preventing the community from performing some religious act;
# selling forbidden (&quot;terefah&quot;) meat as permitted meat (&quot;kosher&quot;);
# failure by a shochet to show his knife to the rabbi for examination;
# purposely bringing oneself to erection;
# engaging in business with one&#x27;s divorced wife that will lead them to come into contact with each other;
# being made the subject of scandal (in the case of a rabbi);
# declaring an unjustified excommunication.

== &quot;Niddui&quot; ==
The &quot;niddui&quot; () ban was usually imposed for a period of seven days (in Israel thirty days). If inflicted on account of money matters, the offender was first publicly warned (&quot;hatra&#x27;ah&quot;) three times, on Monday, Thursday, and Monday successively, at the regular service in the synagogue. During the period of niddui, no one except the members of his immediate household was permitted to associate with the offender, or to sit within four cubits of him, or to eat in his company. He was expected to go into mourning and to refrain from bathing, cutting his hair, and wearing shoes, and he had to observe all the laws that pertained to a mourner. He could not be counted in the minyan. If he died, a stone was placed on his hearse, and the relatives were not obliged to observe traditional Jewish mourning ceremonies.

It was in the power of the court to lessen or increase the severity of the niddui. The court might even reduce or increase the number of days, forbid all intercourse with the offender, and exclude his children from the schools and his wife from the synagogue, until he became humbled and willing to repent and obey the court&#x27;s mandates. According to one opinion (recorded in the name of &quot;Sefer Agudah&quot;), the possibility that the offender might leave the Jewish community due to the severity of the excommunication did not prevent the court from adding rigor to its punishments so as to maintain its dignity and authority. This opinion is vehemently contested by the Taz who cites earlier authorities of the same opinion (Maharshal; Maharam; Mahari Mintz) and presents proof of his position from the Talmud. Additionally, the Taz notes that his edition of the &quot;Sefer Agudah&quot; does not contain the cited position.

== &quot;Herem&quot; ==
If the offense was in reference to monetary matters, or if the punishment was inflicted by an individual, the laws were more lenient, the chief punishment being that men might not associate with the offender. At the expiration of the period the ban was lifted by the court. If, however, the excommunicate showed no sign of penitence or remorse, the niddui might be renewed once and again, and finally the &quot;herem,&quot; the most rigorous form of excommunication, might be pronounced. This extended for an indefinite period, and no one was permitted to teach the offender or work for him, or benefit him in any way, except when he was in need of the bare necessities of life.

== &quot;Nezifah&quot; ==
A milder form than either niddui or herem was the &quot;nezifah&quot; ban. (In modern Hebrew, &quot;nezifah&quot; generally means &quot;a dressing-down&quot; or &quot;reading (someone) the riot act&quot;, i.e., a stern verbal rebuke.) This ban generally only lasted one day. During this time the offender dared not appear before him whom he had displeased. He had to retire to his house, speak little, refrain from business and pleasure, and manifest his regret and remorse. He was not required, however, to separate himself from society, nor was he obliged to apologize to the man whom he had insulted; for his conduct on the day of nezifah was sufficient apology. But when a scholar or prominent man actually pronounced the formal niddui on one who had slighted him, all the laws of niddui applied. This procedure was, however, much discouraged by the sages, so that it was a matter of proper pride for a rabbi to be able to say that he had never pronounced the ban of excommunication. Maimonides concludes with these words the chapter on the laws of excommunication:

== Cases ==

Arguably the most famous case of a herem is that of Baruch Spinoza, the seventeenth-century philosopher.

Another renowned case is the herem the Vilna Gaon ruled against the early Hassidic groups in 1777 and then again in 1781, under the charge of believing in panentheism.

Except in rare cases in the Haredi and Hasidic communities, &quot;herem&quot; stopped existing after the Haskalah, when local Jewish communities lost their political autonomy, and Jews were integrated into the gentile nations in which they lived.
* In August 1918, while Ukraine was ruled by Pavlo Skoropadskyi&#x27;s Second Hetmanate while under Imperial German Army occupation, the Orthodox Jewish rabbis of Odessa pronounced the herem against Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, and other Jewish Bolsheviks.
* In 1945, rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism (a Jewish religious movement that seeks to divorce Judaism from belief in a personal deity), was formally excommunicated by the Haredi Union of Orthodox Rabbis (&quot;Agudath HaRabonim&quot;).
* In 2004, the High Court of South Africa upheld a herem against a Johannesburg businessman because he refused to pay his former wife alimony as ordered by a beth din.
* A herem against members of Neturei Karta who attended the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust was declared by numerous Haredi religious leaders, including the leaders of the Satmar and Chabad Hassidic groups.

<text>Leicester Tigers (officially Leicester Football Club) are a professional rugby union club based in Leicester, England. They play in Premiership Rugby, England&#x27;s top division of rugby.

The club was founded in 1880 and since 1892 plays its home matches at Mattioli Woods Welford Road in the south of the city. The club has been known by the nickname Tigers since at least 1885. In the 2023–24 Premiership Rugby season Tigers finished 8th, this entitled them to compete in the 2024–25 European Rugby Champions Cup. The current head coach is Michael Cheika who was appointed in June 2024.

Leicester have won 21 major titles. They were European Champions twice, back-to-back in 2001 and 2002; have won a record 11 English Championships, five RFU Knockout Cups and three Anglo-Welsh Cups, most recently in 2017. Leicester most recently won the Premiership Rugby title in the 2022 season, and appeared in a record nine successive Premiership finals, from 2005 to 2013. Leicester is one of only three teams never to have been relegated from the top division. Leicester have appeared in five European finals, the joint-second most overall, as well as the two victories they have also lost finals three times, in 1997, 2007 and 2009. In 2021 they played in the European Rugby Challenge Cup final.

Six Leicester Tigers players were members of the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final winning side including captain Martin Johnson.

==History==

===Foundation and Tom Crumbie era (1880–1928)===

Leicester Football Club was formed on 3 August 1880 by the merger of three smaller teams: Leicester Athletic Society, Leicester Amateurs and Leicester Alert. The club&#x27;s first game was a scoreless draw on 23 October against Moseley at the Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground. On 10 September 1892 Leicester played their first game at Welford Road against a Leicestershire XV.

Tom Crumbie was appointed secretary on 2 August 1895, a position he held for the next 33 years. Crumbie has been credited with dragging the club to national prominence. He disbanded reserve and third teams making the First XV an invitation side and introducing players from all over the country. Tigers first silverware was the Midlands Counties Cup won for the first time in 1898 against Moseley. Having won the Midlands Counties Cup every year from 1898 to 1905, they dropped out &quot;to give other teams a chance&quot;. On their return to the competition in 1909 Tigers won the cup again.
In 1903 Jack Miles became the first home-produced England international. Leicester&#x27;s status as a premier club was confirmed in 1905 when a crowd of 20,000 was on hand to see the club face The Original All Blacks, losing 28–0. December 1909 saw Tigers play the Barbarians for the first time, holding them to a 9–9 draw. The fixture became a vital feature in the club&#x27;s calendar delivering large attendances until open professionalism and league rugby in the 1990s forced it to gradually be abandoned due to fixture congestion. Tigers won the Midlands Counties Cup three more times in four years to cement their place as the midland&#x27;s premier side before the outbreak of war in 1914. The visit of the Invincible All Blacks on 4 October 1924 saw a record attendance at Welford Road of 35,000 that stands to this day. Tigers were beaten 27–0 by the tourists.

===Lions captains, decline and club restructure (1928–1971)===
Club captain Doug Prentice captained the 1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia. The first BBC radio broadcast of a Tigers game was against Waterloo on 29 November 1930; Tigers won 21–5. Bernard Gadney became the club&#x27;s first home-produced England captain in 1934 and was captain when four Leicester players were part of the first England side to beat the All Blacks. Gadney also became the club&#x27;s second player to captain the British Lions on their tour to Argentina. 1936-37 was the worst season since 1889-90 for the club with only 14 wins from 39 matches.

Tigers first televised game by the BBC was on 3 February 1951 when they beat London Scottish 14–0 at the Richmond Athletic Ground.
The club underwent a significant restructure in the 1956/57 season. The practice of being an &quot;invitation&quot; club featuring only a First XV stopped and Tigers adopted a more traditional membership club based approach with multiple sides. The &quot;A XV&quot; was to be re-introduced under the name &quot;Extra First XV&quot; with a third &quot;Colts XV&quot; also formed. The 1963/64 season saw David Matthews set the record for most consecutive appearances for the club with 109. Matthews was to become captain in 1965 and in 1966/67 lead the club to a record 33 wins. Chalkie White became coach in 1968; the same season Tom Berry became Leicester&#x27;s first President of the RFU. White was credited with revolutionising Leicester&#x27;s players in response to rule changes that opened up the game. 1970/71 saw Peter Wheeler emerge as first-choice hooker having made his debut the year before, he ended the season on England&#x27;s tour to the Far East. Attendance for the annual Barbarians game hit a nadir with a crowd of only 2,518.

===Introduction of competitions (1971–1978)===

The 1971/72 season saw changes that would radically change both the club and the game. The RFU introduced a national Knockout Cup competition for clubs and on 16 November 1971 Tigers played their first competitive cup match since 1914, a 10–3 defeat to Nottingham at their Beeston ground. Also introduced that season was Tigers&#x27; first &quot;Youth&quot; XV, based on a collection of the best 14 and 15-year-olds in the county. Only six years later Paul Dodge became the first graduate to win an international cap.

Tigers were not involved in the 1974-75 Cup and lost in the 1st round of the 1975-76 Cup. This forced the club into the Midlands qualifiers for the only time. This era saw a huge increase in the popularity of the Barbarians annual fixture with crowds of 15,000 in 1973 &amp; 1975, 17,000 in 1974 and 21,000 in 1976. This contrasted with usual crowds in the low hundreds. 1976-77 saw the introduction of regional &quot;Merit Tables&quot; by the RFU, the first step on the road to full leagues. Based around traditional fixtures Tigers finished second to Moseley in the Midlands Merit Table with a record of played 8 won 6. It took 6 years before Leicester were drawn at home in the cup but in 1977-78 they received four in a row on their way to a first Twickenham final against Gloucester. The game ended in a 6–3 loss to the Cherry and Whites; the attendance was 25,282 - more than double the previous season. Cup success also coincided with Tigers&#x27; membership more than doubling from 750 in 1978 to 2,000 by the end of 1979.

===Centenary and cup and league success (1979–1988)===

Leicester secured their first national trophy, the 1978–79 John Player Cup, by defeating Moseley 15–12. Tigers retained the cup in 1979–80 beating London Irish 21–9 at Twickenham in front of a record crowd of 27,000. 1979–80 also saw Tigers win the Midlands Merit Table for the first time. To celebrate the club&#x27;s centenary a six-match tour to Australia and Fiji was arranged in August 1980, the first undertaken by an English club in the southern hemisphere. Prestige fixtures staged at Welford Road to mark the centenary were the visit of the Irish Wolfhounds, Romania, and Queensland. Tigers retained the Midlands Merit Table title in November with an undefeated record. On 25 April 1981 Tigers&#x27; Dusty Hare broke the world record for points scored in first-class fixtures with 3,658 points. Leicester retained the cup in 1980–81 by beating Gosforth 22–15.

Leicester was knocked out in the semi-finals of the 1982 Cup. This was also Chalkie White&#x27;s last season with the club after 30 years as a player, administrator or coach. A new generation of players debuted in the early &#x27;80s: Dean Richards, John Wells, and Rory Underwood. In 1985 in the penultimate step towards league rugby, the Merit Table A was launched for two seasons where Tigers finished fourth and second. League rugby was launched in England with the 1987–88 Courage League and all sides now played all other sides in a round-robin. Tigers lost only one match all season and the end of the 1987–88 season Tigers became England&#x27;s first official champions.

Tigers finished the 1988–89 Courage League in sixth place, their joint-worst ever finish. During the late 1980s and early 1990s several key members of the Leicester pack came through the youth ranks and became key first-team contributors, most notably lock Martin Johnson who debuted in 1989 and later became club captain; flanker Neil Back who joined in 1990; and the front row trio of Graham Rowntree, Richard Cockerill, and Darren Garforth who started 166 games together between 1992 and 2002.

===Professional and European success (1993–2003)===
From 1993 to 2002 Leicester enjoyed a remarkable nine trophies in ten years. This streak started when Leicester won the 1993 Pilkington Cup. In 1993/94 Tigers finished runners up in the Courage League to Bath. Leicester finished as Courage League champion in 1994–95.

The advent of the 1995–96 season brought two important changes: rugby union (and consequently the Tigers) became professional, and European club competition began in the form of the Heineken cup. The 1995/96 season was another of just missing out to perennial rivals Bath who secured a league and cup double after defeating Leicester in the Pilkington Cup final. In Leicester&#x27;s debut season in the Heineken Cup the team reached the final, losing 28–9 against Brive. Leicester won the 1997 Pilkington Cup Final 9–3 against Sale. That summer Martin Johnson was named as captain for the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa. In February 1998 Dean Richards was appointed as Director of Rugby following Bob Dwyer&#x27;s sacking.

Under Richards, Leicester entered a golden age, winning four consecutive Premiership Rugby titles in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, as well as back to back Heineken Cups in 2001 and 2002.
During the 1998–99 Premiership, the Tigers title was sealed in the penultimate match of the season. In the 1999-2000 Premiership season Leicester retained their title. Tigers&#x27; third successive Premiership title was sealed early on 17 March 2001. In the 2001 Heineken Cup final Tigers beat Stade Français 34–30 to secure the club&#x27;s first continental title. Tigers had won the inaugural Premiership playoffs the week before so also sealed an unprecedented treble. That summer Martin Johnson was named captain for the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, becoming the first man to lead two tours.

Leicester became the first side to retain a European title after beating Munster 15–9 in the 2002 Heineken Cup Final. Leicester also retained their fourth successive Premiership title in 2002. This brought the club&#x27;s total to six championships, tying Bath&#x27;s record. During this time Leicester went 57 games unbeaten at home from 30 December 1997 to 30 November 2002 and earned 52 successive wins. During these four seasons, Leicester lost only 14 games out of the 92 they played.

During the 2003–04 season, Leicester&#x27;s form suffered and with eight games left in the season Dean Richards was sacked. After Richards&#x27; departure Tigers turned to his assistant coach John Wells, who guided Leicester to the regular season top of the league in his only full season. In Martin Johnson and Neil Back&#x27;s last game for Leicester they lost the Premiership Final to London Wasps.

===Premiership success (2004–2013)===

Pat Howard succeeded Wells as the Head Coach. Howard coached the club for two seasons losing a Premiership final to Sale in his first season. Over the summer of 2006, the core of a new pack was recruited, and in Howard&#x27;s second season Leicester won their first piece of silverware for five years, winning the Anglo-Welsh Cup, and sealed the club&#x27;s first domestic league and cup double after winning the Premiership final 44–16 against Gloucester. However, Leicester lost the Heineken Cup Final to Wasps. Howard left the club at the end of the season.

Howard was succeeded for one season by the coach of Marcelo Loffreda, who started after the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Loffreda had a torrid time in charge despite getting to two finals. After losing the Anglo Welsh Cup final to the Ospreys, Leicester became the first side to win an away game in the Premiership playoffs by beating Gloucester in the semi-finals, but lost to Wasps in the final. After this final Loffreda was sacked.
Heyneke Meyer was the board&#x27;s choice to replace Loffreda, but family circumstances led to his resignation. Richard Cockerill took over, the appointment was confirmed as permanent on 17 April 2009. Cockerill lead Leicester to two Premiership titles in as many years. In the 2009 Premiership final Leicester beat London Irish 10–9, and Tigers retained their title the following year as they defeated Saracens 33–27. After an historic placing kicking competition decided the 2009 Heineken cup semi-final, Leicester lost the 2009 Heineken Cup Final to Irish province Leinster.
On Friday 6 November 2009 Leicester hosted the world champion Springboks of South Africa and the young Leicester side triumphed 22–17.

Domestic success continued with Tigers reaching Premiership finals but losing in 2011 and 2012, against Saracens and Harlequins respectively, and winning the 2012 LV Cup. In 2013 Tigers won their record extending 10th English title defeating local rivals Northampton Saints 37–17.

===Championship drought (2013–2020)===
The next year Northampton beat Tigers 21–20 in the Premiership semi final at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens. The next two years Tigers suffered heavy away defeats in the semi-finals to Bath (47–10) and Saracens (44–17).

On Monday 2 January 2017, Leicester sacked Richard Cockerill as Director of Rugby. Aaron Mauger was placed in temporary charge of the team, winning the 2017 Anglo-Welsh Cup, until Matt O&#x27;Connor was announced as the new head coach. Under O&#x27;Connor Tigers secured their 13th consecutive playoff appearance where they lost narrowly to Wasps 21–20. In the 2017–18 season successive home defeats to Northampton and Newcastle in Leicester&#x27;s final two home games saw Tigers miss the playoffs for the first time since 2005. After a 40–6 defeat in the opening game of the 2018-19 Premiership Rugby season O&#x27;Connor was sacked by the club with immediate effect. Geordan Murphy was placed in charge of the side on an interim basis. Murphy was then made the permanent head coach on 18 December 2018 despite the team being on an eight match losing run. Results did not improve and a final day defeat against Bath saw Leicester finish 11th in the Premiership, their worst ever finish.

After a delayed start to the season due to the 2019 Rugby World Cup Tigers fortunes did not improve, and on 21 January 2020 it was announced after months of speculation that England&#x27;s forwards coach Steve Borthwick would join the club as head coach once his duties with England were finished. His start was later confirmed as July 2020.

On 16 March 2020 the 2019-20 Premiership Rugby season was suspended for 5 weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, with group training suspended indefinitely on 23 March. After the cancellation of games the club implemented 25% wage cuts on all staff, including players, on 22 April 2020 it was reported that Tigers players were unhappy with this and had engaged a solicitor to represent them, though this was quickly denied, on 11 May 2020 CEO Simon Cohen left the club after an 8-year tenure and was replaced by Andrea Pinchen. On 4 June 2020 it was revealed that Tigers were set to lose up to £5m of revenue during the coronavirus enforced shutdown, eventually making 31 employees redundant. On 29 June it was reported that the pay dispute which started in April could result in several players leaving the club after refusing to cut their pay, with 5 players including Manu Tuilagi and Telusa Veainu leaving later that week after refusing to amend their contracts in light of the global pandemic.

The completion of the delayed 2019-20 Premiership Rugby season between August and October saw another 11th-place finish for Leicester, saved from relegation only by a points deduction from Saracens for breaching the salary cap. On 13 November 2020, just 8 days before the start of the 2020-21 Premiership Rugby season Geordan Murphy left as director of rugby in a decision described as &quot;mutual&quot;.

===Borthwick in charge (2020–2022)===
With new head coach Steve Borthwick now in charge of team selection Leicester got off to a winning start against Gloucester. In his first season at the club Borthwick guided Leicester to the 2020-21 European Rugby Challenge Cup final and 6th place in the league, securing Champions Cup rugby for the first time in two years.

Tigers started the following season strongly, five wins in the opening five rounds was the club&#x27;s best start in the Premiership era, the club remained unbeaten for 15 games in all competitions, the second best start to a season ever, but failed to tie the record after losing to Wasps on 9 January 2022. A week later Leicester overcame an 18-point deficit in the second half to beat Connacht, a Hosea Saumaki try sealing the win on the final play of the game, and secure progress to their first Champions Cup knock out stages since 2016.

In Europe, Leicester progressed past Clermont Auvergne over two legs, despite getting red cards in both matches, but lost at home to Leinster 23–14, after falling behind 20–0 in the first half to the Irish side.

Domestically they secured a first home play-off semi final since 2013, with two games to spare, after a 56–26 win against Bristol Bears. Tigers&#x27; winger Chris Ashton broke the Premiership Rugby all-time try scoring record in this match, his hat-trick taking him to 95 career league tries. In the semi-final they faced local rivals Northampton Saints, but much of the build up was focused on recently retired former captain Tom Youngs whose wife, Tiffany, died from cancer in week preceding the match. His brother Ben Youngs started the match, and it was his half back partner George Ford who inspired the victory scoring a &quot;full house&quot; with a try, conversion, penalty &amp; drop goal for 22 points in a 27–13 win.

In the final Leicester faced Saracens, a re-match of the 2010 &amp; 2011 finals. Ford wasn&#x27;t to last long in the final withdrawing injured in the 23rd minute &amp; being replaced by Freddie Burns. With the matching tied 12-12 it was Burns who scored the 80th minute drop goal to win Leicester their 11th English title, only two seasons after finishing in 11th place.

Speculation began that Borthwick was in line to succeed Eddie Jones as England head coach after the 2023 Rugby World Cup, but after a poor 2022 Autumn internationals Jones was replaced by Borthwick on 19 December 2022. He was initially replaced as Leicester head coach in an interim capacity by Richard Wigglesworth, the club&#x27;s starting scrum half in the 2022 Premiership final &amp; previous attack coach. On 22 February 2023, it was announced that Dan McKellar would take the role on a full time basis from 1 July 2023, previously having been &#x27;s forwards coach.

===Coaching instability (2023–)===
After a single season, the third worst in the club&#x27;s league history, McKellar was dismissed on 22 June 2024. On 27 June 2024, Tigers appointed fellow Australian Michael Cheika as the new head coach on an initial one-year deal. In February 2025, it was announced that Cheika himself would be stepping down following the conclusion of his contract at the end of the 2024–25 season. Former Leicester prop and ex-Munster head coach Graham Rowntree was the rumoured frontrunner to replace him for the following season.

==Women&#x27;s team==

Leicester Tigers formed a women&#x27;s team on 15 July 2021, launched in partnership with Lichfield Ladies.

==Club culture==

===Nickname===

The club&#x27;s formal name is Leicester Football Club but is widely known by the nickname &quot;Tigers&quot;. The first known use of the name was after a game against Bedford School in February 1885, the &quot;Leicester Daily Post&quot; reporting that &quot;the Tiger stripes were keeping well together&quot;. The origin of the nickname is uncertain most probably coming from the side&#x27;s chocolate and yellow playing kit, but it may have come from the club&#x27;s links to the Leicestershire Regiment, who had received the nickname &#x27;Tigers&#x27; after serving in India, and from 1825 had worn a cap-badge with a &#x27;royal&#x27; tiger to mark the connection.

In their early years the side were also known as &quot;The Death or Glory Boys&quot; on account of their black shirts.

===Player identification===

In the 1926–27 season Leicester started using letters to identify their forwards; &quot;The Birmingham Post&quot; report for the match against Bath on 6 October 1926 noted &quot;Leicester&#x27;s forwards were picked out easily as their jerseys were decorated with large bold letters A-G&quot;. On 12 September 1931 against Old Blues the practice was expanded to the whole team.

This tradition lasted until 1998 when Premiership Rugby rules forced Leicester to abandon lettering and Tigers first wore numbers on 5 September 1998 against Harlequins at Welford Road.

Since then Leicester have only returned to letters for non-competition friendlies against sides such as or the New Zealand Maori. On the current kit the letters are displayed in small on the front of the jersey.

===Colours===

Tigers&#x27; very first kit was black with white shorts and black socks, with the club&#x27;s crest in the centre of the chest. From 1884 to 1887, the club played in chocolate and yellow shirts, likely giving rise to the club&#x27;s nickname, white shorts and black socks before experimenting with claret and French grey horizontal stripes between 1887 and 1891.

The first use of the scarlet, green and white was on 3 October 1891 against Wolverton at Belgrave Cricket &amp; Cycle Ground. However, for the 1891–92 season, the pattern was vertical stripes. It was not until 1895 that the now-traditional scarlet, green and white horizontal stripes were introduced to the jersey, paired with black shorts and socks until 1906. The Tigers then played three season between 1906 and 1909 in white shirts with navy shorts, the first two seasons with a leaping tiger logo on the left breast before reverting to a scarlet, green and white striped jersey, while retaining the navy shorts. This new kit layout lasted until 1947 when the navy shorts were swapped for white.

The Tigers kit and colours did not materially change between 1947 and 1999, only slight variations in the sizes of the stripes, the addition of a manufacturer&#x27;s logo in 1975, a sponsor in 1988 and in 1991 the addition of the club crest for the first time since 1908.

In 1999, the Tigers switched to a darker green and have played in a variety of kit designs since.


===Summary of kit manufacturers and sponsors===

==Rivalries==

Tigers&#x27; main rivals are Northampton Saints; the East Midlands Derby has taken place between the two clubs for over 130 years.

Tigers had a minor rivalry with Wasps after the club&#x27;s move to Coventry in 2014, contesting the M69 Derby until Wasps went into administration in 2022.

==Stadium==
The club plays its home games at Mattioli Wood Welford Road. The ground was opened in 1892 and the first stands accommodated 3,000 spectators. The clubhouse was built on the Aylestone Road end in 1909, the Members&#x27; &amp; Crumbie Stands were built just before and just after the First World War respectively. A stand was built at the Welford Road end in 1995, initially called the Alliance &amp; Leicester Stand it is currently known as the Mattioli Woods Stand. The total ground capacity is currently 25,849 after redevelopments in 2008 and 2015.

Before redevelopment of Welford Road began in 2008 the club explored other options. On 23 November 2004 the club announced that it had entered into a 50–50 joint venture with the city&#x27;s main football club, Leicester City, to purchase City&#x27;s current ground, Leicester City Stadium. If the purchase had gone through, the Tigers would have surrendered their lease on Welford Road and moved into Walkers Stadium. However, after several months of talks, the two clubs ended any ground share plans in July 2005.

On 11 June 2007 the club announced plans that it was working for a redevelopment plan which would raise the capacity from 17,498 to 25,000 by 2011. On 20 February 2008 Leicester Tigers received planning consent for the £60million redevelopment of Welford Road. The first phase of the development was a new 10,000 seat North Stand (Granby Halls side), taking overall capacity from 17,498 to 24,000. In the summer of 2008 work began on the construction of the new North Stand. The work was completed for the first home game of the 2009-10 season against Newcastle Falcons.

At the end of the 2008–09 season three home games were played at the King Power Stadium, then known as the Walkers Stadium, due to demolition of the old north stand. These saw Tigers play Bath twice, a 20–15 win in the Heineken Cup quarter finals and a victory in the Premiership Play Off semi finals as well as a 73–3 win against Bristol. Tigers have also played two Heineken Cup Semi-final games at the King Power Stadium, against Toulose and Llanelli Scarlets in 2005 and 2007 respectively, but the ground was designated as a neutral venue for both.

On 27 February 2015 Tigers announced plans to continue the redevelopment of Welford Road by replacing the clubhouse and temporary West Stand with a new permanent building with a 3,100 capacity. Work started on 28 May 2015 and was completed by January 2016.

In October 2020, Mattioli Woods extended their naming rights deal to include the entire stadium for 5 seasons until 2024–25. The stadium became Mattioli Woods Welford Road.

<text>Acrylonitrile is an organic compound with the formula and the structure . It is a colorless, volatile liquid. It has a pungent odor of garlic or onions. Its molecular structure consists of a vinyl group () linked to a nitrile (). It is an important monomer for the manufacture of useful plastics such as polyacrylonitrile. It is reactive and toxic at low doses. 

Acrylonitrile is one of the components of ABS plastic (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene).

==Structure and basic properties==
Acrylonitrile is an organic compound with the formula and the structure . It is a colorless, volatile liquid although commercial samples can be yellow due to impurities. It has a pungent odor of garlic or onions. Its molecular structure consists of a vinyl group () linked to a nitrile (). It is an important monomer for the manufacture of useful plastics such as polyacrylonitrile. It is reactive and toxic at low doses.

==Production==
Acrylonitrile was first synthesized by the French chemist Charles Moureu in 1893. Acrylonitrile is produced by catalytic ammoxidation of propylene, also known as the SOHIO process. In 2002, world production capacity was estimated at 5 million tonnes per year, rising to about 6 million tonnes by 2017. Acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide are significant byproducts that are recovered for sale. In fact, the 2008–2009 acetonitrile shortage was caused by a decrease in demand for acrylonitrile.

In the SOHIO process, propylene, ammonia, and air (oxidizer) are passed through a fluidized bed reactor containing the catalyst at 400–510 °C and 50–200 kPag. The reactants pass through the reactor only once, before being quenched in aqueous sulfuric acid. Excess propylene, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and dinitrogen that do not dissolve are vented directly to the atmosphere, or are incinerated. The aqueous solution consists of acrylonitrile, acetonitrile, hydrocyanic acid, and ammonium sulfate (from excess ammonia). A recovery column removes bulk water, and acrylonitrile and acetonitrile are separated by distillation. One of the first useful catalysts was bismuth phosphomolybdate () supported on silica. Further improvements have since been made.

===Alternative routes===
Various green chemistry routes to acrylonitrile are being explored from renewable feedstocks, such as lignocellulosic biomass, glycerol (from biodiesel production), or glutamic acid (which can itself be produced from renewable feedstocks). The lignocellulosic route involves fermentation of the biomass to propionic acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, which are then converted to acrylonitrile by dehydration and ammoxidation. The glycerol route begins with its dehydration to acrolein, which undergoes ammoxidation to give acrylonitrile. The glutamic acid route employs oxidative decarboxylation to 3-cyanopropanoic acid, followed by a decarbonylation-elimination to acrylonitrile. Of these, the glycerol route is broadly considered to be the most viable, although none of these green methods are commercially competitive.

==Uses==
Acrylonitrile is used principally as a monomer to prepare polyacrylonitrile, a homopolymer, or several important copolymers, such as styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), and other synthetic rubbers such as acrylonitrile butadiene (NBR). Hydrodimerization of acrylonitrile affords adiponitrile, used in the synthesis of certain nylons:
Acrylonitrile is also a precursor in the manufacture of acrylamide and acrylic acid.

===Synthesis of chemicals===
Hydrogenation of acrylonitrile is one route to propionitrile. Hydrolysis with sulfuric acid gives acrylamide sulfate, . This salt can be converted to acrylamide with treatment with base or to methyl acrylate by treatment with methanol.

The reaction of acrylonitrile with protic nucleophiles is a common route to a variety of specialty chemicals. The process is called cyanoethylation:
Typical protic nucleophiles are alcohols, thiols, and especially amines.

Acrylonitrile and derivatives, such as 2-chloroacrylonitrile, are dienophiles in Diels–Alder reactions.

==Health effects==
Acrylonitrile is toxic with LD50 = 81 mg/kg (rats). It undergoes explosive polymerization. The burning material releases fumes of hydrogen cyanide and oxides of nitrogen. It is classified as a Class 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and workers exposed to high levels of airborne acrylonitrile are diagnosed more frequently with lung cancer than the rest of the population. Acrylonitrile is one of seven toxicants in cigarette smoke that are most associated with respiratory tract carcinogenesis. The mechanism of action of acrylonitrile appears to involve oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage. Acrylonitrile increases cancer in high dose tests in male and female rats and mice and induces apoptosis in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.

It evaporates quickly at room temperature (20 °C) to reach dangerous concentrations; skin irritation, respiratory irritation, and eye irritation are the immediate effects of this exposure. Pathways of exposure for humans include emissions, auto exhaust, and cigarette smoke that can expose the human subject directly if they inhale or smoke. Routes of exposure include inhalation, oral, and to a certain extent dermal uptake (tested with volunteer humans and in rat studies). Repeated exposure causes skin sensitization and may cause central nervous system and liver damage.

There are two main excretion processes of acrylonitrile. The primary method is excretion in urine when acrylonitrile is metabolized by being directly conjugated to glutathione. The other method is when acrylonitrile is enzymatically converted into 2-cyanoethylene oxide which will produce cyanide end products that ultimately form thiocyanate, which is excreted via urine. Exposure can thus be detected via blood draws and urine sampling.

In July 2024, the International Agency for Research on Cancer upgraded acrylonitrile&#x27;s classification from &#x27;possibly carcinogenic&#x27; to carcinogenic for humans. The Agency found sufficient evidence linking it to lung cancer.
===Use in plastic bottles===
In June 1974 Coca-Cola introduced the acrylonitrile/styrene 32oz Easy‐Goer plastic bottle, offering energy savings during manufacture, increased durability, and weight savings over glass. In March 1977 after a suit filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council the FDA rescinded approval of acrylonitrile bottles citing adverse effects on test animals. Monsanto, Coca-Cola&#x27;s bottle manufacturer refuted the decision, stating “repeated tests have demonstrated that there is no detectable migration of acrylonitrile into the bottle&#x27;s content.” After several appeals in court by September 1977 the FDA finalized their ban.
===Incidents===
A large amount of acrylonitrile (approximately 6500 tons) leaked from an industrial polymer plant owned by Aksa Akrilik after the violent 17th August 1999 earthquake in Turkey. Over 5000 people were affected and the exposed animals had died. The leak was only noticed by the company 8 hours after the incident. Healthcare workers did not know about the health effects of acrylonitrile and tried to treat the victims with painkillers and IV fluids. One lawyer, Ayşe Akdemir, sued the company with 44 families as the plaintiffs. Aksa Akrilik was sued by 200 residents who were affected by acrylonitrile. An increase in cancer cases in the area was confirmed by the Turkish Medical Association, as the cancer rate in the affected area has increased by 80%, from 1999 to April 2002. In 2003, the owner of Aksa Akrilik died from lung cancer related to acrylonitrile exposure. As of 2001, this is the largest known acrylonitrile leak.

== Occurrence ==
Acrylonitrile is not naturally formed on Earth. It has been detected at the sub-ppm level at industrial sites. It persists in the air for up to a week. It decomposes by reacting with oxygen and hydroxyl radical to form formyl cyanide and formaldehyde. Acrylonitrile is harmful to aquatic life. Acrylonitrile has been detected in the atmosphere of Titan, a moon of Saturn. Computer simulations suggest that on Titan conditions exist such that the compound could form structures similar to cell membranes and vesicles on Earth, called azotosomes.

<doc id="309334" wikidata="Q1386190" url="?curid=309334" title="Nicolae Paulescu">
<text>Nicolae Constantin Paulescu (; 30 October 1869 (O.S.) – 17 July 1931) was a Romanian physiologist, professor of medicine, and politician, most famous for his work on diabetes, including patenting &quot;pancreine&quot; (a pancreatic extract containing insulin). The &quot;pancreine&quot; was an extract of bovine pancreas in salted water, after which some impurites were removed with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide.
Paulescu was also, with A. C. Cuza, co-founder of the National Christian Union and later, of the National-Christian Defense League, an early ultranationalist and anti-Semitic Romanian party. He was also a leading member of the militant religious fascist Iron Guard.

==Early life and education==
Born in Bucharest, he was the first of four children of Costache and Maria Paulescu. He displayed remarkable abilities as early as his first school years. He learned French, Latin and Ancient Greek at an early age, so that a few years later he became fluent in all these languages and was able to read classical works of Latin and Greek literature in the original. He also had a particular gift for drawing and music and special inclinations towards natural sciences, such as physics and chemistry. He graduated from the Mihai Viteazul High School in Bucharest in 1888.

In the autumn of 1888, Paulescu left for Paris, where he enrolled in medical school, where he studied with, among others, Étienne Lancereaux. In 1897 he graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree, with a research thesis on the structure of the spleen. At the same time he studied chemistry and physiology at the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris, and also obtained a doctorate in science.

==Career==
Upon receiving his M.D., Paulescu was immediately appointed as assistant surgeon at the Notre-Dame du Perpétuel-Secours Hospital in Paris. In 1900, Paulescu returned to Romania, where he remained until his death (1931) as Head of the Physiology Department of the University of Bucharest Medical School, as well as a Professor of Clinical Medicine at the St. Vincent de Paul Hospital in Bucharest.

===Work on insulin===
In 1916, he succeeded in developing an aqueous pancreatic extract which, when injected into a diabetic dog, proved to have a normalizing effect on blood sugar levels. Shortly after completing the experiments, he was called to service in the Romanian army. After World War I, he resumed his research.

From 24 April to 23 June 1921, Paulescu published four papers at the Romanian Section of the Society of Biology in Paris:

* The effect of the pancreatic extract injected into a diabetic animal by way of the blood.
* The influence of the time elapsed from the intravenous pancreatic injection into a diabetic animal.
* The effect of the pancreatic extract injected into a normal animal by way of the blood.

An extensive paper on this subject – &quot;Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation&quot; – was submitted by Paulescu on 22 June to the &quot;Archives Internationales de Physiologie&quot; in Liège, Belgium, and was published in the August 1921 issue of this journal.

The method used by Paulescu to prepare his pancreatic extract was similar to a procedure described by the American researcher Israel Kleiner in an article published two years earlier, in 1919, in the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot;. Using his procedure, Kleiner had been able to demonstrate significant reductions in the concentration of blood and urinary glucose after intravenous injections of his extract.

Paulescu secured the patent rights for his method of manufacturing &quot;pancreine&quot; on 10 April 1922 (patent no. 6254) from the Romanian Ministry of Industry and Trade.

==Nobel Prize controversy==
In February 1922, doctor Frederick Banting and biochemist John Macleod from the University of Toronto, Canada, published their paper on the successful use of a different, alcohol-based pancreatic extract for normalizing blood sugar (glucose) levels (glycemia) in a human patient. An unsuccessful attempt had been made on 11 January 1922, and a successful administration followed on 25 January 1922. The Toronto team felt confident in the purity of their insulin and injected it intravenously into the patient, clearing up his glycosuria and ketonuria and restoring normal blood sugar.

Paulescu&#x27;s 1921 papers mentioned that the extract caused toxic side effects on dogs, which made it unusable in humans (&quot;qui la rendent inapplicable dans la pratique médicale&quot;, &#x27;which make it inapplicable in medical practice&#x27;). Therefore, when he tested his pancreatic extract on humans on 25 February 1922, he administered the extract rectally. The patients seemed to show some reduction in glycosuria. This apparent success emboldened him to inject his extract intravenously into a diabetic patient on 24 March, after which the patient&#x27;s blood sugar apparently fell to zero (&quot;.000&quot;, &quot;véritable AGLYCÉMIE&quot;). A blood sugar level of zero should have placed the patient into a hypoglycemic coma, but he made no mention of this effect in any of his papers. In contrast, the Toronto team had known for several months that dogs could be placed into a diabetic coma by an overdose of insulin, so they prepared orange juice and candy for the clinical trials.

After Banting and Macleod were awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Nicolae Paulescu wrote to the Nobel Prize committee claiming that he had discovered insulin first. However, his claims to priority cannot be sustained. Paulescu prepared pancreatic extract in 1916 and tested it in dogs, but Israel Kleiner tested pancreatic extract in dogs in 1915, as did George Ludwig Zuelzer in 1906. Zuelzer also wrote to the Nobel Prize committee asserting priority. All of these earlier attempts had produced pancreatic extracts that caused side effects in dogs or humans. The Toronto team had noticed the same side effects with their earlier extracts, but they continued working on the problem until they had purified insulin.

Professor Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct &quot;the historical wrong&quot; against Paulescu. Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow, Scotland, the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital, vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes, and a founding member of the International Diabetes Federation. In an article for a 1971 issue of the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, Murray wrote:

&quot;&quot;Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulesco, the distinguished Roumanian scientist, who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in diabetic dogs.&quot;

&quot;In a recent private communication Professor Tiselius, head of the Nobel Institute, has expressed his personal opinion that Paulesco was equally worthy of the award in 1923.&quot;&quot;

==Antisemitism==
Paulescu has been criticized for his political activity centered on antisemitic views and eugenism, which found their expression also in articles such as &quot;The Judeo-Masonic plot against the Romanian nation&quot; (expressed in his book, &quot;Philosophic Physiology: The Hospital, the Koran, the Talmud, the Kahal and Freemasonry&quot;):

We Romanians are faced with a capital question: What shall we do with these uninvited guests who suddenly installed themselves in this country, or rather, with these evil parasites who are both thieves and assassins? Can we exterminate them just as, for instance, bedbugs are killed? This would be the simplest and handliest way of getting rid of them; if we were to act according to the laws of the Talmud, it would even be legitimate.

He then continued:
But no! - we must not even think of such a thing... because we are Christians, - Christians, so hated by the Jews!
We must even forget revenge - &quot;sine qua non&quot; passion of a good &quot;shochet&quot; - for the plunders and the killings done or caused by the Jews.
More than that! we must love the Jews and do them good - because we have Christ as our teacher - the spring of eternal love - who in His divine wisdom said: Love your enemies... do good to them that hate you.

Nichifor Crainic, the principal ideologist of Orthodoxism, paid homage to Paulescu, by calling him &quot;the founder of Christian nationalism&quot; and &quot;the most complete and most normative eminent doctrinaire of our nationalism.&quot;

He was an associate of ultranationalist Professor A. C. Cuza, and wrote extensively for the latter&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Apărarea Națională&quot; (&#x27;The National Defense&#x27;). Paulescu influenced Cuza to incorporate religion into his doctrine. He also heavily influenced the leader of the Iron Guard organisation, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Codreanu extensively quoted Paulescu, and acknowledged the powerful impact that Paulescu&#x27;s ideas had on his own development. Paulescu was the first to link together Romanian antisemitism, Christianity and ultranationalism. In 1922, Paulescu co-founded the &quot;National Christian Union&quot;, which evolved into the National-Christian Defense League (LANC) in 1923, together with A. C. Cuza. That same year, the NCU adopted the swastika as its official symbol.

In &quot;Degenerarea rasei jidănești&quot; (1928) (transl. &#x27;Degeneration of the Jewish Race&#x27;, using a racist slur), Paulescu states that Jews are degenerate because their brains weigh much less than &quot;Aryan&quot; brains. He singles out for their low brain weight the Nobel Prize laureates Anatole France (non-Jewish), Albert Einstein and Henri Bergson.

His starting point was a theory of passions and of social conflicts examined from the angle of a discipline he called &quot;philosophical physiology&quot;. It was illustrated, in the main, by the behavior of Jews, who represented the extreme case of a race ruled by two essential passions: the instincts of domination and ownership.

Following protests from several Jewish organizations, the inauguration of Professor Paulescu&#x27;s bust at the &quot;Hôtel-Dieu&quot; State Hospital in Paris, scheduled for 27 August 2003, had to be cancelled.
&quot;&quot;If the Nobel Committee in 1923 judged the entire persona of its laureate, then &quot;Hôtel Dieu&quot; in 2003 must do no less and conclude that Paulescu&#x27;s brutal inhumanity nullifies any scientific merit&quot;&quot; (Simon Wiesenthal Center letter to the French Minister of Health, Jean-François Mattéi, and the Romanian Ambassador in Paris).

Nicolae Cajal, a Romanian Jewish member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences and the President of the Jewish Communities&#x27; Federation of Romania from 1994 to 2004, defended recognition of Paulescu&#x27;s scientific work, saying there is a need to distinguish between individuals&#x27; private views and their scientific merit and that his father, Dr. Marcu Cajal, a student of Paulescu, had admired Paulescu for his scientific skills though he disagreed (as a Jew) with Paulescu&#x27;s anti-Semitic views.

==Honours==
Paulescu died in Bucharest in 1931. He is buried in Bellu Cemetery.

In 1990, he was elected posthumously as member of the Romanian Academy.

In 1993, the Institute of Diabetes, Nutrition and Metabolic Diseases in Bucharest was named in his honour (Institutul de Diabet, Nutriţie şi Boli Metabolice &quot;N. C. Paulescu&quot;). The institute was renamed on 3 March 1993, by the Ministry of Health Decree no. 273, at the initiative of Prof. Dr. Iulian Mincu.

On 27 June 1993, in Cluj-Napoca, a postmark was dedicated in Paulescu&#x27;s honour as part of celebrating the World Day Against Diabetes. Paulescu was also honoured on a postage stamp issued by Romania in 1994. The stamp is one in a set of seven stamps honouring famous Romanians.

<text>In mathematics, a Heyting algebra (also known as pseudo-Boolean algebra) is a bounded lattice (with join and meet operations written ∨ and ∧ and with least element 0 and greatest element 1) equipped with a binary operation &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; called &quot;implication&quot; such that (&quot;c&quot; ∧ &quot;a&quot;) ≤ &quot;b&quot; is equivalent to &quot;c&quot; ≤ (&quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot;). From a logical standpoint, &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is by this definition the weakest proposition for which modus ponens, the inference rule &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot; ⊢ &quot;B&quot;, is sound. Like Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras form a variety axiomatizable with finitely many equations. Heyting algebras were introduced in 1930 by Arend Heyting to formalize intuitionistic logic.

Heyting algebras are distributive lattices. Every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra when &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; is defined as ¬&quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot;, as is every complete distributive lattice satisfying a one-sided infinite distributive law when &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; is taken to be the supremum of the set of all &quot;c&quot; for which &quot;c&quot; ∧ &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;. In the finite case, every nonempty distributive lattice, in particular every nonempty finite chain, is automatically complete and completely distributive, and hence a Heyting algebra.

It follows from the definition that 1 ≤ 0 → &quot;a&quot;, corresponding to the intuition that any proposition &quot;a&quot; is implied by a contradiction 0. Although the negation operation ¬&quot;a&quot; is not part of the definition, it is definable as &quot;a&quot; → 0. The intuitive content of ¬&quot;a&quot; is the proposition that to assume &quot;a&quot; would lead to a contradiction. The definition implies that &quot;a&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;a&quot; = 0. It can further be shown that &quot;a&quot; ≤ ¬¬&quot;a&quot;, although the converse, ¬¬&quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;, is not true in general, that is, double negation elimination does not hold in general in a Heyting algebra.

Heyting algebras generalize Boolean algebras in the sense that Boolean algebras are precisely the Heyting algebras satisfying &quot;a&quot; ∨ ¬&quot;a&quot; = 1 (excluded middle), equivalently ¬¬&quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot;. Those elements of a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; of the form ¬&quot;a&quot; comprise a Boolean lattice, but in general this is not a subalgebra of &quot;H&quot; (see below).

Heyting algebras serve as the algebraic models of propositional intuitionistic logic in the same way Boolean algebras model propositional classical logic. The internal logic of an elementary topos is based on the Heyting algebra of subobjects of the terminal object 1 ordered by inclusion, equivalently the morphisms from 1 to the subobject classifier Ω.

The open sets of any topological space form a complete Heyting algebra. Complete Heyting algebras thus become a central object of study in pointless topology. 

Every Heyting algebra whose set of non-greatest elements has a greatest element (and forms another Heyting algebra) is subdirectly irreducible, whence every Heyting algebra can be made subdirectly irreducible by adjoining a new greatest element. It follows that even among the finite Heyting algebras there exist infinitely many that are subdirectly irreducible, no two of which have the same equational theory. Hence no finite set of finite Heyting algebras can supply all the counterexamples to non-laws of Heyting algebra. This is in sharp contrast to Boolean algebras, whose only subdirectly irreducible one is the two-element one, which on its own therefore suffices for all counterexamples to non-laws of Boolean algebra, the basis for the simple truth table decision method. Nevertheless, it is decidable whether an equation holds of all Heyting algebras.

Heyting algebras are less often called pseudo-Boolean algebras, or even Brouwer lattices, although the latter term may denote the dual definition, or have a slightly more general meaning.

== Formal definition ==
A Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; is a bounded lattice such that for all &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;H&quot; there is a greatest element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;H&quot; such that

:formula_1

This element is the relative pseudo-complement of &quot;a&quot; with respect to &quot;b&quot;, and is denoted &quot;a&quot;→&quot;b&quot;. We write 1 and 0 for the largest and the smallest element of &quot;H&quot;, respectively.

In any Heyting algebra, one defines the pseudo-complement ¬&quot;a&quot; of any element &quot;a&quot; by setting ¬&quot;a&quot; = (&quot;a&quot;→0). By definition, formula_2, and ¬&quot;a&quot; is the largest element having this property. However, it is not in general true that formula_3, thus ¬ is only a pseudo-complement, not a true complement, as would be the case in a Boolean algebra.

A complete Heyting algebra is a Heyting algebra that is a complete lattice.

A subalgebra of a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; is a subset &quot;H&quot;1 of &quot;H&quot; containing 0 and 1 and closed under the operations ∧, ∨ and →. It follows that it is also closed under ¬. A subalgebra is made into a Heyting algebra by the induced operations.

==Alternative definitions==
===Category-theoretic definition===
A Heyting algebra formula_4 is a bounded lattice that has all exponential objects.

The lattice formula_4 is regarded as a category where 
meet, formula_6, is the product. The exponential condition means that for any objects formula_7 and formula_8 in formula_4 an exponential formula_10 uniquely exists as an object in formula_4.

A Heyting implication (often written using formula_12 or formula_13 to avoid confusions such as the use of formula_14 to indicate a functor) is just an exponential: formula_15 is an alternative notation for formula_10. From the definition of exponentials we have that implication (formula_17) is right adjoint to meet (formula_18). This adjunction can be written as formula_19 or more fully as:
formula_20

===Lattice-theoretic definitions===
An equivalent definition of Heyting algebras can be given by considering the mappings:

:formula_21

for some fixed &quot;a&quot; in &quot;H&quot;. A bounded lattice &quot;H&quot; is a Heyting algebra if and only if every mapping &quot;fa&quot; is the lower adjoint of a monotone Galois connection. In this case the respective upper adjoint &quot;ga&quot; is given by &quot;ga&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;→&quot;x&quot;, where → is defined as above.

Yet another definition is as a residuated lattice whose monoid operation is ∧. The monoid unit must then be the top element 1. Commutativity of this monoid implies that the two residuals coincide as &quot;a&quot;→&quot;b&quot;.

===Bounded lattice with an implication operation===
Given a bounded lattice &quot;A&quot; with largest and smallest elements 1 and 0, and a binary operation →, these together form a Heyting algebra if and only if the following hold:
#formula_22
#formula_23
#formula_24
#formula_25
where equation 4 is the distributive law for →.

===Characterization using the axioms of intuitionistic logic===
This characterization of Heyting algebras makes the proof of the basic facts concerning the relationship between intuitionist propositional calculus and Heyting algebras immediate. (For these facts, see the sections &quot;Provable identities&quot; and &quot;Universal constructions&quot;.) One should think of the element formula_26 as meaning, intuitively, &quot;provably true&quot;. Compare with the axioms at Intuitionistic logic.

Given a set &quot;A&quot; with three binary operations →, ∧ and ∨, and two distinguished elements formula_27 and formula_26, then &quot;A&quot; is a Heyting algebra for these operations (and the relation ≤ defined by the condition that formula_29 when &quot;a&quot;→&quot;b&quot; = formula_26) if and only if the following conditions hold for any elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; of &quot;A&quot;:

#formula_31
#formula_32
#formula_33
#formula_34
#formula_35
#formula_36
#formula_37
#formula_38
#formula_39
#formula_40
#formula_41
Finally, we define ¬&quot;x&quot; to be &quot;x&quot;→ formula_27.

Condition 1 says that equivalent formulas should be identified. Condition 2 says that provably true formulas are closed under modus ponens. Conditions 3 and 4 are &quot;then&quot; conditions. Conditions 5, 6 and 7 are &quot;and&quot; conditions. Conditions 8, 9 and 10 are &quot;or&quot; conditions. Condition 11 is a &quot;false&quot; condition.

Of course, if a different set of axioms were chosen for logic, we could modify ours accordingly.

== Properties ==

===General properties===
The ordering formula_43 on a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; can be recovered from the operation → as follows: for any elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; of &quot;H&quot;, formula_29 if and only if &quot;a&quot;→&quot;b&quot; = 1.

In contrast to some many-valued logics, Heyting algebras share the following property with Boolean algebras: if negation has a fixed point (i.e. ¬&quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot; for some &quot;a&quot;), then the Heyting algebra is the trivial one-element Heyting algebra.

===Provable identities===
Given a formula formula_45 of propositional calculus (using, in addition to the variables, the connectives formula_46, and the constants 0 and 1), it is a fact, proved early on in any study of Heyting algebras, that the following two conditions are equivalent:
# The formula &quot;F&quot; is provably true in intuitionist propositional calculus.
# The identity formula_47 is true for any Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; and any elements formula_48.
The metaimplication is extremely useful and is the principal practical method for proving identities in Heyting algebras. In practice, one frequently uses the deduction theorem in such proofs.

Since for any &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; we have formula_29 if and only if &quot;a&quot;→&quot;b&quot; = 1, it follows from that whenever a formula &quot;F&quot;→&quot;G&quot; is provably true, we have formula_50 for any Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot;, and any elements formula_48. (It follows from the deduction theorem that &quot;F&quot;→&quot;G&quot; is provable (unconditionally) if and only if &quot;G&quot; is provable from &quot;F&quot;, that is, if &quot;G&quot; is a provable consequence of &quot;F&quot;.) In particular, if &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are provably equivalent, then formula_52, since ≤ is an order relation.

1 ⇒ 2 can be proved by examining the logical axioms of the system of proof and verifying that their value is 1 in any Heyting algebra, and then verifying that the application of the rules of inference to expressions with value 1 in a Heyting algebra results in expressions with value 1. For example, let us choose the system of proof having modus ponens as its sole rule of inference, and whose axioms are the Hilbert-style ones given at Intuitionistic logic#Axiomatization. Then the facts to be verified follow immediately from the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras given above.

1 ⇒ 2 also provides a method for proving that certain propositional formulas, though tautologies in classical logic, &quot;cannot&quot; be proved in intuitionist propositional logic. In order to prove that some formula formula_45 is not provable, it is enough to exhibit a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; and elements formula_48 such that formula_55.

If one wishes to avoid mention of logic, then in practice it becomes necessary to prove as a lemma a version of the deduction theorem valid for Heyting algebras: for any elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; of a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot;, we have formula_56.

For more on the metaimplication 2 ⇒ 1, see the section &quot;Universal constructions&quot; below.

===Distributivity===
Heyting algebras are always distributive. Specifically, we always have the identities
#formula_57
#formula_58

The distributive law is sometimes stated as an axiom, but in fact it follows from the existence of relative pseudo-complements. The reason is that, being the lower adjoint of a Galois connection, formula_6 preserves all existing suprema. Distributivity in turn is just the preservation of binary suprema by formula_6.

By a similar argument, the following infinite distributive law holds in any complete Heyting algebra:

:formula_61

for any element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;H&quot; and any subset &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;H&quot;. Conversely, any complete lattice satisfying the above infinite distributive law is a complete Heyting algebra, with
:formula_62
being its relative pseudo-complement operation.

===Regular and complemented elements===
An element &quot;x&quot; of a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; is called regular if either of the following equivalent conditions hold:
#&quot;x&quot; = ¬¬&quot;x&quot;.
#&quot;x&quot; = ¬&quot;y&quot; for some &quot;y&quot; in &quot;H&quot;.
The equivalence of these conditions can be restated simply as the identity ¬¬¬&quot;x&quot; = ¬&quot;x&quot;, valid for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;H&quot;.

Elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; are called complements to each other if &quot;x&quot;∧&quot;y&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot;∨&quot;y&quot; = 1. If it exists, any such &quot;y&quot; is unique and must in fact be equal to ¬&quot;x&quot;. We call an element &quot;x&quot; complemented if it admits a complement. It is true that &quot;if&quot; &quot;x&quot; is complemented, then so is ¬&quot;x&quot;, and then &quot;x&quot; and ¬&quot;x&quot; are complements to each other. However, confusingly, even if &quot;x&quot; is not complemented, ¬&quot;x&quot; may nonetheless have a complement (not equal to &quot;x&quot;). In any Heyting algebra, the elements 0 and 1 are complements to each other. For instance, it is possible that ¬&quot;x&quot; is 0 for every &quot;x&quot; different from 0, and 1 if &quot;x&quot; = 0, in which case 0 and 1 are the only regular elements.

Any complemented element of a Heyting algebra is regular, though the converse is not true in general. In particular, 0 and 1 are always regular.

For any Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot;, the following conditions are equivalent:
# &quot;H&quot; is a Boolean algebra;
# every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;H&quot; is regular;
# every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;H&quot; is complemented.
In this case, the element is equal to 

The regular (respectively complemented) elements of any Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; constitute a Boolean algebra &quot;H&quot;reg (respectively &quot;H&quot;comp), in which the operations ∧, ¬ and →, as well as the constants 0 and 1, coincide with those of &quot;H&quot;. In the case of &quot;H&quot;comp, the operation ∨ is also the same, hence &quot;H&quot;comp is a subalgebra of &quot;H&quot;. In general however, &quot;H&quot;reg will not be a subalgebra of &quot;H&quot;, because its join operation ∨reg may be different from ∨. For we have See below for necessary and sufficient conditions in order for ∨reg to coincide with ∨.

===The De Morgan laws in a Heyting algebra===
One of the two De Morgan laws is satisfied in every Heyting algebra, namely

:formula_63

However, the other De Morgan law does not always hold. We have instead a weak de Morgan law:

:formula_64

The following statements are equivalent for all Heyting algebras &quot;H&quot;:
#&quot;H&quot; satisfies both De Morgan laws,
#formula_65
#formula_66
#formula_67
#formula_68
#formula_69
#formula_70
Condition 2 is the other De Morgan law. Condition 6 says that the join operation ∨reg on the Boolean algebra &quot;H&quot;reg of regular elements of &quot;H&quot; coincides with the operation ∨ of &quot;H&quot;. Condition 7 states that every regular element is complemented, i.e., &quot;H&quot;reg = &quot;H&quot;comp.

We prove the equivalence. Clearly the metaimplications and are trivial. Furthermore, and result simply from the first De Morgan law and the definition of regular elements. We show that by taking ¬&quot;x&quot; and ¬¬&quot;x&quot; in place of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in 6 and using the identity Notice that follows from the first De Morgan law, and results from the fact that the join operation ∨ on the subalgebra &quot;H&quot;comp is just the restriction of ∨ to &quot;H&quot;comp, taking into account the characterizations we have given of conditions 6 and 7. The metaimplication is a trivial consequence of the weak De Morgan law, taking ¬&quot;x&quot; and ¬&quot;y&quot; in place of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in 5.

Heyting algebras satisfying the above properties are related to De Morgan logic in the same way Heyting algebras in general are related to intuitionist logic.

==Heyting algebra morphisms==

===Definition===
Given two Heyting algebras &quot;H&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;2 and a mapping we say that &quot;ƒ&quot; is a morphism of Heyting algebras if, for any elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;H&quot;1, we have:
#formula_71
#formula_72
#formula_73
#formula_74

It follows from any of the last three conditions (2, 3, or 4) that &quot;f&quot; is an increasing function, that is, that whenever .

Assume &quot;H&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;2 are structures with operations →, ∧, ∨ (and possibly ¬) and constants 0 and 1, and &quot;f&quot; is a surjective mapping from &quot;H&quot;1 to &quot;H&quot;2 with properties 1 through 4 above. Then if &quot;H&quot;1 is a Heyting algebra, so too is &quot;H&quot;2. This follows from the characterization of Heyting algebras as bounded lattices (thought of as algebraic structures rather than partially ordered sets) with an operation → satisfying certain identities.

===Properties===
The identity map from any Heyting algebra to itself is a morphism, and the composite of any two morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is a morphism. Hence Heyting algebras form a category.

===Examples===
Given a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; and any subalgebra &quot;H&quot;1, the inclusion mapping is a morphism.

For any Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot;, the map defines a morphism from &quot;H&quot; onto the Boolean algebra of its regular elements &quot;H&quot;reg. This is &quot;not&quot; in general a morphism from &quot;H&quot; to itself, since the join operation of &quot;H&quot;reg may be different from that of &quot;H&quot;.

==Quotients==
Let &quot;H&quot; be a Heyting algebra, and let We call &quot;F&quot; a filter on &quot;H&quot; if it satisfies the following properties:
#formula_75
#formula_76
#formula_77

The intersection of any set of filters on &quot;H&quot; is again a filter. Therefore, given any subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;H&quot; there is a smallest filter containing &quot;S&quot;. We call it the filter generated by &quot;S&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; is empty, Otherwise, &quot;F&quot; is equal to the set of &quot;x&quot; in &quot;H&quot; such that there exist with 

If &quot;H&quot; is a Heyting algebra and &quot;F&quot; is a filter on &quot;H&quot;, we define a relation ~ on &quot;H&quot; as follows: we write whenever and both belong to &quot;F&quot;. Then ~ is an equivalence relation; we write for the quotient set. There is a unique Heyting algebra structure on such that the canonical surjection becomes a Heyting algebra morphism. We call the Heyting algebra the quotient of &quot;H&quot; by &quot;F&quot;.

Let &quot;S&quot; be a subset of a Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; and let &quot;F&quot; be the filter generated by &quot;S&quot;. Then &quot;H&quot;/&quot;F&quot; satisfies the following universal property:
:Given any morphism of Heyting algebras satisfying for every &quot;f&quot; factors uniquely through the canonical surjection That is, there is a unique morphism satisfying The morphism &quot;&quot; is said to be &quot;induced&quot; by &quot;f&quot;.

Let be a morphism of Heyting algebras. The kernel of &quot;f&quot;, written ker &quot;f&quot;, is the set It is a filter on &quot;H&quot;1. (Care should be taken because this definition, if applied to a morphism of Boolean algebras, is dual to what would be called the kernel of the morphism viewed as a morphism of rings.) By the foregoing, &quot;f&quot; induces a morphism It is an isomorphism of onto the subalgebra &quot;f&quot;[&quot;H&quot;1] of &quot;H&quot;2.

==Universal constructions==

===Heyting algebra of propositional formulas in &quot;n&quot; variables up to intuitionist equivalence===
The metaimplication in the section &quot;Provable identities&quot; is proved by showing that the result of the following construction is itself a Heyting algebra:
#Consider the set &quot;L&quot; of propositional formulas in the variables &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
# Endow &quot;L&quot; with a preorder ≼ by defining &quot;F&quot;≼&quot;G&quot; if &quot;G&quot; is an (intuitionist) logical consequence of &quot;F&quot;, that is, if &quot;G&quot; is provable from &quot;F&quot;. It is immediate that ≼ is a preorder.
# Consider the equivalence relation &quot;F&quot;~&quot;G&quot; induced by the preorder F≼G. (It is defined by &quot;F&quot;~&quot;G&quot; if and only if &quot;F&quot;≼&quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot;≼&quot;F&quot;. In fact, ~ is the relation of (intuitionist) logical equivalence.)
# Let &quot;H&quot;0 be the quotient set &quot;L&quot;/~. This will be the desired Heyting algebra.
# We write [&quot;F&quot;] for the equivalence class of a formula &quot;F&quot;. Operations →, ∧, ∨ and ¬ are defined in an obvious way on &quot;L&quot;. Verify that given formulas &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, the equivalence classes [&quot;F&quot;→&quot;G&quot;], [&quot;F&quot;∧&quot;G&quot;], [&quot;F&quot;∨&quot;G&quot;] and [¬&quot;F&quot;] depend only on [&quot;F&quot;] and [&quot;G&quot;]. This defines operations →, ∧, ∨ and ¬ on the quotient set &quot;H&quot;0=&quot;L&quot;/~. Further define 1 to be the class of provably true statements, and set 0=[⊥].
# Verify that &quot;H&quot;0, together with these operations, is a Heyting algebra. We do this using the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras. &quot;H&quot;0 satisfies conditions THEN-1 through FALSE because all formulas of the given forms are axioms of intuitionist logic. MODUS-PONENS follows from the fact that if a formula ⊤→&quot;F&quot; is provably true, where ⊤ is provably true, then &quot;F&quot; is provably true (by application of the rule of inference modus ponens). Finally, EQUIV results from the fact that if &quot;F&quot;→&quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot;→&quot;F&quot; are both provably true, then &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are provable from each other (by application of the rule of inference modus ponens), hence [&quot;F&quot;]=[&quot;G&quot;].

As always under the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras, we define ≤ on &quot;H&quot;0 by the condition that &quot;x&quot;≤&quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot;→&quot;y&quot;=1. Since, by the deduction theorem, a formula &quot;F&quot;→&quot;G&quot; is provably true if and only if &quot;G&quot; is provable from &quot;F&quot;, it follows that [&quot;F&quot;]≤[&quot;G&quot;] if and only if F≼G. In other words, ≤ is the order relation on &quot;L&quot;/~ induced by the preorder ≼ on &quot;L&quot;.

===Free Heyting algebra on an arbitrary set of generators===
In fact, the preceding construction can be carried out for any set of variables {&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; : &quot;i&quot;∈&quot;I&quot;} (possibly infinite). One obtains in this way the &quot;free&quot; Heyting algebra on the variables {&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;}, which we will again denote by &quot;H&quot;0. It is free in the sense that given any Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; given together with a family of its elements 〈&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;: &quot;i&quot;∈&quot;I&quot; 〉, there is a unique morphism &quot;f&quot;:&quot;H&quot;0→&quot;H&quot; satisfying &quot;f&quot;([&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;])=&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The uniqueness of &quot;f&quot; is not difficult to see, and its existence results essentially from the metaimplication of the section &quot;Provable identities&quot; above, in the form of its corollary that whenever &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are provably equivalent formulas, &quot;F&quot;(〈&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;〉)=&quot;G&quot;(〈&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;〉) for any family of elements 〈&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;〉in &quot;H&quot;.

===Heyting algebra of formulas equivalent with respect to a theory &quot;T&quot;===
Given a set of formulas &quot;T&quot; in the variables {&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;}, viewed as axioms, the same construction could have been carried out with respect to a relation &quot;F&quot;≼&quot;G&quot; defined on &quot;L&quot; to mean that &quot;G&quot; is a provable consequence of &quot;F&quot; and the set of axioms &quot;T&quot;. Let us denote by &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot; the Heyting algebra so obtained. Then &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot; satisfies the same universal property as &quot;H&quot;0 above, but with respect to Heyting algebras &quot;H&quot; and families of elements 〈&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;〉 satisfying the property that &quot;J&quot;(〈&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;〉)=1 for any axiom &quot;J&quot;(〈&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;〉) in &quot;T&quot;. (Let us note that &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot;, taken with the family of its elements 〈[&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;]〉, itself satisfies this property.) The existence and uniqueness of the morphism is proved the same way as for &quot;H&quot;0, except that one must modify the metaimplication in &quot;Provable identities&quot; so that 1 reads &quot;provably true &quot;from T&quot;,&quot; and 2 reads &quot;any elements &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; in &quot;H&quot; &quot;satisfying the formulas of T&quot;.&quot;

The Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot; that we have just defined can be viewed as a quotient of the free Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot;0 on the same set of variables, by applying the universal property of &quot;H&quot;0 with respect to &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot;, and the family of its elements 〈[&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;]〉.

Every Heyting algebra is isomorphic to one of the form &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot;. To see this, let &quot;H&quot; be any Heyting algebra, and let 〈&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;: &quot;i&quot;∈I〉 be a family of elements generating &quot;H&quot; (for example, any surjective family). Now consider the set &quot;T&quot; of formulas &quot;J&quot;(〈&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;〉) in the variables 〈&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;: &quot;i&quot;∈I〉 such that &quot;J&quot;(〈&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;〉)=1. Then we obtain a morphism &quot;f&quot;:&quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot;→&quot;H&quot; by the universal property of &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot;, which is clearly surjective. It is not difficult to show that &quot;f&quot; is injective.

===Comparison to Lindenbaum algebras===
The constructions we have just given play an entirely analogous role with respect to Heyting algebras to that of Lindenbaum algebras with respect to Boolean algebras. In fact, The Lindenbaum algebra &quot;B&quot;&quot;T&quot; in the variables {&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;} with respect to the axioms &quot;T&quot; is just our &quot;H&quot;&quot;T&quot;∪&quot;T&quot;1, where &quot;T&quot;1 is the set of all formulas of the form ¬¬&quot;F&quot;→&quot;F&quot;, since the additional axioms of &quot;T&quot;1 are the only ones that need to be added in order to make all classical tautologies provable.

==Heyting algebras as applied to intuitionistic logic==
If one interprets the axioms of the intuitionistic propositional logic as terms of a Heyting algebra, then they will evaluate to the largest element, 1, in &quot;any&quot; Heyting algebra under any assignment of values to the formula&#x27;s variables. For instance, (&quot;P&quot;∧&quot;Q&quot;)→&quot;P&quot; is, by definition of the pseudo-complement, the largest element &quot;x&quot; such that formula_78. This inequation is satisfied for any &quot;x&quot;, so the largest such &quot;x&quot; is 1.

Furthermore, the rule of modus ponens allows us to derive the formula &quot;Q&quot; from the formulas &quot;P&quot; and &quot;P&quot;→&quot;Q&quot;. But in any Heyting algebra, if &quot;P&quot; has the value 1, and &quot;P&quot;→&quot;Q&quot; has the value 1, then it means that formula_79, and so formula_80; it can only be that &quot;Q&quot; has the value 1.

This means that if a formula is deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms by way of the rule of modus ponens, then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula&#x27;s variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce&#x27;s law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,1} as given above. If we assign to &quot;P&quot; and 0 to &quot;Q&quot;, then the value of Peirce&#x27;s law ((&quot;P&quot;→&quot;Q&quot;)→&quot;P&quot;)→&quot;P&quot; is . It follows that Peirce&#x27;s law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See Curry–Howard isomorphism for the general context of what this implies in type theory.

The converse can be proven as well: if a formula always has the value 1, then it is deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, so the &quot;intuitionistically valid&quot; formulas are exactly those that always have a value of 1. This is similar to the notion that &quot;classically valid&quot; formulas are those formulas that have a value of 1 in the two-element Boolean algebra under any possible assignment of true and false to the formula&#x27;s variables—that is, they are formulas that are tautologies in the usual truth-table sense. A Heyting algebra, from the logical standpoint, is then a generalization of the usual system of truth values, and its largest element 1 is analogous to &#x27;true&#x27;. The usual two-valued logic system is a special case of a Heyting algebra, and the smallest non-trivial one, in which the only elements of the algebra are 1 (true) and 0 (false).

==Decision problems==
The problem of whether a given equation holds in every Heyting algebra was shown to be decidable by Saul Kripke in 1965. The precise computational complexity of the problem was established by Richard Statman in 1979, who showed it was PSPACE-complete and hence at least as hard as deciding equations of Boolean algebra (shown coNP-complete in 1971 by Stephen Cook) and conjectured to be considerably harder. The elementary or first-order theory of Heyting algebras is undecidable. It remains open whether the universal Horn theory of Heyting algebras, or word problem, is decidable. Regarding the word problem it is known that Heyting algebras are not locally finite (no Heyting algebra generated by a finite nonempty set is finite), in contrast to Boolean algebras, which are locally finite and whose word problem is decidable. It is unknown whether free complete Heyting algebras exist except in the case of a single generator where the free Heyting algebra on one generator is trivially completable by adjoining a new top.

== Topological representation and duality theory==
Every Heyting algebra is naturally isomorphic to a bounded sublattice of open sets of a topological space , where the implication formula_81 of is given by the interior of formula_82. 
More precisely, is the spectral space of prime ideals of the bounded lattice and is the lattice of open and quasi-compact subsets of .

More generally, the category of Heyting algebras 
is dually equivalent to the category of Heyting spaces. 
This duality can be seen as restriction of the classical Stone duality of bounded distributive lattices to the (non-full) subcategory of Heyting algebras.

Alternatively, the category of Heyting algebras is dually equivalent to the category of Esakia spaces. This is called Esakia duality.

<text>Plain people are Christian groups in the United States, characterized by separation from the world and by simple living, including plain dressing in modest clothing (including head covering for women). Many plain people have an Anabaptist background. These denominations are largely of German, Swiss German and Dutch ancestry, though people of diverse backgrounds have been incorporated into them. Conservative Friends are traditional Quakers who are also considered plain people; they come from a variety of different ethnic backgrounds.

==Origins==
===Anabaptists===

The Mennonite movement was a reform movement of Anabaptist origins begun by Swiss Brethren and soon thereafter finding greater cohesion based on the teachings of Menno Simons, and the 1632 Dordrecht Confession of Faith. The Amish movement was a reform movement within the Mennonite movement, based on the teachings of Jacob Ammann, who perceived a lack of discipline within the Mennonite movement by those trying to avoid persecution. Ammann argued that prohibited conformation with the world.

===Quakers===
William Penn, having experienced religious persecution as a Quaker, offered asylum to others who were suffering religious persecution, an offer that many followers of Ammann accepted, starting with the Detweiler and Sieber families, who settled in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in 1736. Many of them settled near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which offered some of the most productive non-irrigated farmland in the world. By 1770, the Amish migration had largely ceased.

==Plain dress==
Notable plain groups in the Anabaptist tradition are the Amish (Old Order Amish, New Order Amish, Kauffman Amish Mennonites and Beachy Amish Mennonites), Para-Amish (Believers in Christ, Vernon Community and Caneyville Christian Community), many Mennonites (Old Order Mennonites, Conservative Mennonites, Reformed Mennonites, Orthodox Mennonites, Old Colony Mennonites and Holdeman Mennonites), Hutterites, Bruderhof, certain Schwarzenau Brethren (Old German Baptist Brethren, Old Brethren, and Dunkard Brethren), certain River Brethren (Old Order River Brethren and Calvary Holiness Church) and Charity Christians.

A small number of Quakers (chiefly Conservative Friends and Holiness Friends) still practice plain dress as a part of their testimony of simplicity. The Shakers, a small religious community, dress plainly. Many Apostolic Lutherans also wear plain dress. Historically, members of the Moravian Church wore plain dress. 

Early Methodists wore plain dress, with clergy condemning &quot;high headdresses, ruffles, laces, gold, and &#x27;costly apparel&#x27; in general&quot;. In his sermon &quot;On Dress&quot;, John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, expressed his desire for Methodists to wear plain clothing in the manner practiced by Quakers: &quot;Let me see, before I die, a Methodist congregation, full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation.&quot; Peter Cartwright, a Methodist revivalist, noted the gradual decline of wearing plain dress among Methodists; today, members of denominations in the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, continue to dress plainly, sometimes including abstention of wearing of jewelry, such as wedding rings. The Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches, which continues to observe the ordinance of women&#x27;s headcovering, stipulates &quot;renouncing all vain pomp and glory&quot; and &quot;adorning oneself with modest attire.&quot;

Traditional Adventists and Mormon fundamentalists also wear plain dress.

==Plain customs==
Customs of plain people include:
* Plain clothes, usually in solid, normally dark colors.
* Plain church buildings, or no church buildings whatsoever.
* A utilitarian view of technology, similar to the precautionary principle of technology in that unknowns should be avoided, but the emphasis was on the results in the eyes of God. If they were unsure of how God would look upon a technology, the leaders of the church would determine whether it was to be avoided. The degree to which this principle was supported varied among the congregations, but in general, the Amish people believed that the Mennonites had not done enough to separate themselves from the rest of the world.

==Religious practices==
Anabaptist plain groups typically have a bishop presiding over one congregation (Amish) or over a district (group of congregations) (Old Order Mennonites). Mennonites mostly meet in church buildings, but most Amish meet in members&#x27; homes. Services among Amish and Plain Mennonites are mostly held in Pennsylvania German, a language closely related to Palatinate German, with extra vocabulary. Bishops are commonly chosen by lot as a reflection of God&#x27;s will. While the bishop tends to be influential, he tends to rule by building consensus rather than by issuing edicts.

Most Anabaptist plain groups have an ordnung that among other things regulates clothing. The ordnung is a largely unwritten code of behavior, covering such items as clothing, vehicles, and the use of technology. The ordnung varies slightly from congregation to congregation though is in essence the same. Violations are not considered sins, although pride, selfishness and wilfulness are considered to be serious violations of the faith. The congregation can change the ordnung if there is a majority who desire to do so. Exemptions to the ordnung can be provided. In one instance, one farmer was granted permission to buy a modern tractor since he had arthritis and no children to help him harness horses. In other very hot, dry areas such as the Southwestern United States, where horses may not be able to work hard in the field throughout the day, some provision has been made for mechanical plowing and harvesting.

==Trends==

The Old Order Amish are among the fastest-growing populations in the world. They have low infant mortality rates. The average Amish woman can expect to have at least seven live births. Other plain sects with the same or similar doctrines can be expected to have similarly explosive growth.

Despite this, the Pennsylvania Dutch—which includes Amish, Old Order Mennonite, and Conservative Mennonites—are expected by some to become a smaller percentage of the population as the sects respond to high prices of farmland by spreading out all over the United States and internationally, and the &quot;English&quot; (the Amish exonym for non-Amish persons regardless of ancestry) population spreads out from Philadelphia into suburban and rural areas. Many Amish and plain Mennonites of the last 30 years have moved into non-farm work, such as construction, woodworking, harness making, shopkeeping, auctioneer services and other crafts. Donald Kraybill believes there are plain church communities in 47 states. 

Among people at least five years old living in Lancaster County in 2000,
*89% spoke English at home;
*7% spoke Pennsylvania Dutch;
*4% spoke Spanish.

Most but not all Anabaptist plain churches do not admit children to their church membership, requiring baptism first during the teen years, and so they impose no sanctions on those who do not join but shun those who fall away from the church once becoming a member. Among some groups of Old Order Amish, teenagers who are not yet baptized are not bound by the rules and go through a period of &quot;rumspringa&quot;, often with a certain amount of misbehavior that would not otherwise be tolerated.

==Health==
The Amish generally do not proselytize and discourage intermarriage with outsiders unless they have joined the Amish. Because of their historic tendency to relocate less in their lifetime, a high birthrate, a high number of double cousins as compared with the general public, and a lower number of possible marriage partners, this has historically resulted in marriages of 3rd, 4th, 5th, and other cousins who share ancestors. Similar to European royalty, this close degree of consanguinity has led to certain genetic problems occurring more frequently among the Amish. Dr. D. Holmes Morton has established the Clinic for Special Children to study and treat families with these problems.

Many of the plain churches prohibit insurance, and instead they follow a system of mutual aid to assist each other charitably in case of sickness, accident, death, or property damage. Internal Revenue Service Form 4029 allows one to claim exemption from Social Security taxes under certain restrictive conditions, and members of the plain groups who do not pay these taxes also do not receive death, disability, or retirement benefits from Social Security.

<text>Lale Andersen (23 March 1905 – 29 August 1972) was a German chanson singer-songwriter born in Lehe (now part of Bremerhaven). She is best known for her interpretation of the song &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; in 1939, which by 1941 transcended the conflict to become World War II&#x27;s biggest international hit. Popular with both the Axis and the Allies, Andersen&#x27;s original recording spawned versions, by the end of the War, in most of the major languages of Europe, and by some of the most popular artists in their respective countries.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Andersen was born in Lehe and baptized Elisabeth Carlotta Helena Berta Bunnenberg, but known informally as &quot;Liese-Lotte&quot;—a diminutive of her first two names—to friends and family; this continued after her first marriage when she was known as &quot;Liselotte Wilke&quot;.

In 1922, aged 17, she married German Impressionist painter (1894–1971). They had three children: Björn, Carmen-Litta, and (1929–2017) the youngest of whom also enjoyed a career in the German music industry. Shortly after the birth of their last child, the marriage broke up. Leaving the children in the care of her siblings Thekla and Helmut, Andersen went to Berlin in October 1929, where she reportedly studied acting at the &quot;Schauspielschule&quot; at the Deutsches Theater. In 1931, her marriage ended in divorce. Around this time, she began appearing on stage in various cabarets in Berlin. From 1933 to 1937, she performed at the &quot;Schauspielhaus&quot; in Zürich, where she also met Rolf Liebermann, who would remain a close friend for the rest of her life. In 1938, she was in Munich at the cabaret &quot;Simpl&quot;, and soon afterwards joined the prestigious Kabarett der Komiker (Comedians&#x27; Cabaret) in Berlin.

===&quot;Lili Marleen&quot; and the war years===
While at the Kabarett der Komiker, she met Norbert Schultze, who had composed the music for &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;. Andersen recorded the song in 1939, but it would only become a hit when the &quot;Soldatensender Belgrad&quot; &quot;(Belgrade Soldier&#x27;s Radio)&quot;, the radio station of the German armed forces in Eastern Europe, began broadcasting it in 1941. &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; quickly became immensely popular with German soldiers at the &quot;front&quot;. The transmitter of the radio station at Belgrade, was powerful enough to be received all over Europe and the Mediterranean, and the song soon became popular with the Allied troops as well.

Andersen was awarded a gold disc for over one million sales of &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; [His Masters Voice – EG 6993]. It is thought that she was awarded her copy after the end of World War II. A copy of this particular gold disc owned by the &quot;His Masters Voice&quot; record company was discarded during the renovation of their flagship store on Oxford Street, London, during the 1960s where, hitherto, it had been on display. However, the disc was recovered and is now in a private collection. Nazi officials did not approve of the song and Joseph Goebbels prohibited it from being played on the radio. Andersen was not allowed to perform in public for nine months, not just because of the song but because of her friendship with Rolf Liebermann and other Jewish artists she had met in Zurich. In desperation, she reportedly attempted suicide.
Andersen was so popular, however, that the Nazi government allowed her to perform again, albeit subject to several conditions, one of which was she would not sing &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;. Goebbels did order her to make a new &quot;military&quot; version of the song (with a significant drum) which was recorded in June 1942. In the remaining war years, Andersen had one minor appearance in a 1942 Nazi propaganda movie and was made to sing several propaganda songs in English. Shortly before the end of the war, Andersen retired to Langeoog, a small island off the North Sea coast of Germany.

===Career after World War II===
After the war, Andersen all but disappeared as a singer. In 1949, she married Swiss composer Artur Beul. In 1952 she made a comeback with the song &quot;Die blaue Nacht am Hafen&quot;, the lyrics of which she had written for herself. In 1959, she had another hit &quot;Ein Schiff wird kommen...&quot;, a cover version of &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;, the title song from the movie of the same name, originally sung in Greek by Melina Mercouri.

Each song won her a gold album in West Germany. In 1961, she participated as the West German representative in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Einmal sehen wir uns wieder&quot;, which only reached 13th place with three points. Fifty-six years old at the time, she held the record of the eldest participant at Eurovision for over 45 years – surpassed only in 2008 by the 75-year-old Croatian entertainer 75 Cents.

Throughout the 1960s, she toured Europe, the United States and Canada, until her farewell tour &quot;Goodbye memories&quot; in 1967. Two years later, she published a book &quot;Wie werde ich Haifisch? – Ein heiterer Ratgeber für alle, die Schlager singen, texten oder komponieren wollen&quot; (&quot;How do I become a shark? – A cheerful companion for all who want to sing hit songs, write lyrics, or compose music&quot;), and in 1972, shortly before her death, her autobiography &quot;Der Himmel hat viele Farben&quot; (&quot;The Sky Has Many Colours&quot;) appeared and topped the bestselling list of the West German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;.

===Death===
Andersen died of liver cancer in Vienna on 29 August 1972, aged 67. With her death, She was the first female Eurovision contestant and first German-speaking Eurovision contestant to pass away and third overall, following Jacques Pills and Jean-Paul Mauric, the later also appeared in Eurovision 1961.

==Footnotes==
*Note a: Lale Andersen often wrote her own lyrics, usually under the pseudonym &quot;Nicola Wilke&quot;.
*Note b: Lehe at the time of her birth was an independent municipality. It is now part of Bremerhaven. In 1924 Lehe was amalgamated with the neighbouring Geestemünde to become the city of Wesermünde. Bremerhaven, which was founded in 1827, was merged into Wesermünde in 1939. In 1947, Wesermünde became part of the state of Bremen and was renamed as Bremerhaven.
*Note c: Although some online resources give 1924 as the year of the marriage, Lehrke&#x27;s book contains a copy of the wedding announcement that had appeared in the &quot;Nordwestdeutsche Zeitung&quot; on 1 April 1922.
*Note d: In her early career, Lale Andersen was sometimes billed as &quot;Liselotte Wilke&quot;.

<doc id="309347" wikidata="Q1774270" url="?curid=309347" title="Climbing shoe">
<text>A climbing shoe is a specialized type of footwear designed for rock climbing. Typical climbing shoes have a tight fit, an asymmetrical downturn, and a sticky rubber sole with an extended rubber rand to the heel and the toe. Different types of shoes can be better suited for different levels of technique and routes.

== Design ==
Modern climbing shoes use carefully crafted multi-piece patterns to conform very closely to the wearer&#x27;s feet. More traditional climbing shoes tend to be stiff, but modern performance oriented models are often quite soft with a flexible midsole.

A typical climbing shoe is made out of 9 parts: heel loops, lining, tongue tab, tongue, closure system, upper, toe box, rand, and heel.

=== Materials ===
Leather is the most common upper material, but other materials such as fabric and synthetic leather are also used. The climbing rubber used for soles was developed specifically for rock climbing. The two types of leather used in shoe construction are unlined leather and lined leather. Unlined leather stretches more than its lined counterpart. As such, lined leather is used in areas where stretching is not desired, and occurs the most. Unlined leather is often used on the tongue and tongue tab of the shoe where stretching is desired. Synthetic materials are more rigid and provide ventilation for the shoe; they are often used in the liner, heel loops, and the closure system.

The soles of climbing shoes are made out of special rubber composites. These rubber composites differ depending on the desired stickiness, durability, and softness. Climbing shoes have rubber that are unique to the type of shoe as it molds onto the holds of a wall. There is a tradeoff between stickiness of a rubber and its durability. Stickier shoes provide better performance for climbers, but are worn out quicker.

=== Closure systems ===
Modern climbing shoes come in different closure systems that allow the wearer to adjust the tightness of the shoe.

==== Lace-up shoes ====
Lace-up shoes use a traditional lace, like those on sneakers, that reaches the rand of the shoe. Lace-ups provide climbers with the most adjustability in the shoe&#x27;s tightness. According to REI, a climber wearing lace-up shoes can loosen the shoe for walk-off routes or tighten the laces to complete a harder route.

==== Velcro shoes ====
Velcro shoes will often have one or two Velcro straps that allow for the adjustment of tightness. Velcro allows for quicker but less precise adjustments than laced shoes. They are commonly used in indoor-climbing environments because they are easier to take on and off.

==== Slip-on ====
Slip-on shoes do not have any form of adjustable closure, allowing the user to fit their shoes into tighter fitting spaces. They need to be fitted properly in order to prevent the feet from moving inside the shoe. A benefit of this close fit is a higher sensitivity to the climb, allowing the wearer of the shoe to use smaller holds for their feet.

=== Nose types ===
Climbing shoes are typically made with one of two types of noses: pointed or rounded.

==== Pointed ====
Pointed shoes can make it easier for climbers to stand on smaller holds.

==== Rounded ====
Rounded shoes allow all toes to reach the front of the shoe more easily, granting the climber more power when pushing off the wall.

== Shoe types ==
Modern climbing shoes are typically subdivided into three different profiles based on their shape: neutral, moderate, and aggressive.

=== Neutral ===
Neutral shoes, similar to everyday sneakers, feature a flatter outer sole that allows the foot to rest flat during use. According to REI, this style of shoe is best fitted for beginner climbers because of comfortability. More experienced climbers may also use neutral shoes to climb longer routes.

=== Moderate ===
Slightly more downturned than the neutral shoe, moderate shoes have a cambered (curved) toe box. They typically have a thinner sole and stickier rubber than neutral shoes. This enables climbers to climb different types of routes, including slab, crack, slight overhangs, and multi-pitch.

=== Aggressive ===
Aggressive shoes feature a stronger downturn than moderate shoes. This style of shoe is often the most painful to wear for climbers due to its strong curve and heel tension. According to REI, they are shaped asymmetrically to allow for climbers to place greater weight on their big toe in footwork techniques. Aggressive shoes, similar to moderate shoes, have thin soles and sticky rubber, giving climbers greater sensitivity in their feet.

== Fit ==
Climbing shoes fit very closely to support the foot and allow the climber to use small footholds effectively. Most climbers forgo socks in order to achieve a more precise fit. Climbers will typically wear shoes in a way that sometimes uncomfortably constricts their feet. A smaller size allows the toes to be at the front of the shoe, preventing it from shifting inside the shoe, and can allow the climber to generate more force. As a result of their tightness, most climbing shoes, particularly the more aggressive or technical styles, are uncomfortable when properly fitted.

Because pointed shoes may cause the toes to not reach the front of the shoe, this can lead to the use of smaller shoes. Depending on the material of the upper, the shoes may can stretch up to an additional two sizes, which can encourage climbers to buy shoes that are even smaller than they typically would. The tight fit of climbing shoes has raised concerns about the impact on climbers&#x27; feet. Foot pain or discomfort as a result of tight shoes is a common complaint among climbers. Given their stiff nature, the foot can be compressed while wearing climbing shoes, and chronic injuries and deformities, like hallux valgus and achilles tendinitis, can occur with long-term usage of overly-tight shoes.

== Uses ==
The modern climbing shoe&#x27;s features leverage a climber&#x27;s ability to use their feet more technically.

=== Edging ===
Edging is a footwork technique where climbers rely on their toes to step on smaller surfaces. Shoes that are downturned aggressively and have a pointed toe allow the climber to utilize their feet on smaller foot holds. The stiffer the sole of the shoe, the more pressure a climber is able to put on their toes.

=== Smearing ===
Smearing is when a climber uses the sole of their shoe to walk on a wall or a flat surface without any footholds. Shoes with a more sensitive sole made of thinner rubber allow for the climber to have more flexibility in their feet and not use footholds.

=== Toe hook and heel hook ===
A toe hook is when the climber utilizes the rubber on the toe of their shoe to hook their toe onto a hold. A heel hook is when the climber utilizes the rubber on the heel of their shoe to hook their heel onto a hold. The rubber allows for greater frictional support and adherence between the shoe and the hold.

== History ==

Early rock climbers used heavy-soled mountaineering boots studded with metal cleats and hobnails. An advance on this for dry rock, were boots with Vibram soles, with a pattern of rubber studs developed by Vitale Bramani in Italy in the 1930s. In postwar Britain, a new generation of climbers like Joe Brown began to climb harder routes wearing plimsolls (rubber-soled canvas sneakers), sometimes with woollen socks over them to improve grip. Pierre Allain was an enthusiastic French rock climber who experimented with hard composite rubber-soled canvas boots; by the late 1950s, his &quot;PA&quot; boots were being used by climbers worldwide. Fellow French climber Edmond Bourdonneau later introduced &quot;EB&quot; boots in 1950 after purchasing Pierre&#x27;s company, which had softer rubber soles and became very popular in the 1960 and 1970s. In 1982 Boreal, the Spanish company located in Villena, produced the &quot;Firé&quot; style of shoe with a revolutionary sticky rubber sole.

== Repairs ==
A climbing shoe will deteriorate at different rates depending on the habits of the climber wearing it. The sole may wear down or delaminate from the rand, and important seams can fray which endangers the structural integrity of the shoe. A study done on consumer practices suggests that users will either repair or purchase new objects when faced with worn materials that affect service. It was found that consumers tend to choose to repair products when the practice allows them to maintain a habit, such as having broken-in shoes that the consumer would prefer to wear instead of a new pair. When climbing shoes experience wear, especially damage that prevents use, they can be sent to a resoler. The resoler can perform repairs such as a half-resole or a re-rand to mend the shoes. A resole will not change how the shoe fits or is shaped, which allows the consumer to maintain their habits. A re-rand is required for more damaged shoes, which can impact the shoe&#x27;s shape. If a shoe that experiences wear is left unrepaired for too long, it may reach a point where it can no longer be mended and a new pair must be purchased.

== Health concerns ==

=== Downsizing ===
A vast majority of climbers choose to use tight climbing shoes since less restrictive shoes leave room for the foot to slip around inside the shoe and can make it harder for individuals to gain stability on smaller climbing surfaces. Smaller climbing shoes are especially common among more elite climbers. Tighter shoes can help improve a climber&#x27;s ability, so many climbers are willing to compromise their foot comfort. The climbing culture around smaller shoes has garnered attention regarding the health of climbers’ feet. The smaller fit has been shown to stunt bone growth in younger climbers and have lasting injuries and deformities. The injuries and health complications related to tight climbing shoes have also prompted research into developing more appropriate climbing shoes. One group of researchers has developed a climbing shoe prototype that molds to the foot for a more natural fit with features that accommodate the variance in foot width among climbers. The findings from this prototype show that different shoe designs can help reduce the risk of injury while maintaining climbers’ ability level.

=== Inhalation of rubber particles ===

Rubber-derived chemicals (RDCs) are chemicals that may be harmful to humans when ingested and can be found in high concentrations in the rubber soles of climbing shoes. The rubber additives are released into the air when the rubber wears down through use. A study has found that there are higher levels of RDCs present in indoor climbing gyms compared to other environments where climbing shoes are not typically worn. Adults who frequent these gyms inhale more RDCs than the average person, and this raises potential health concerns about rubber additive levels in climbing shoes’ soles.

<text>Rochester International Airport is an international airport located seven miles (11 km) south of downtown Rochester in Olmsted County, Minnesota. It is the second-busiest airport in Minnesota. Its name used to be &quot;Rochester Municipal Airport&quot;, before adding customs and immigration facilities specifically for Mayo Clinic purposes in 1995.

The airport covers and has two concrete runways: runway 13/31 and runway 3/21.

Airline service is currently provided by American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. The airport has a large FedEx Express freight terminal and a general aviation terminal.

==History==
The original Rochester airport was founded in 1928 by the Mayo Foundation to bring patients to Mayo Clinic. It was in what is now southeast Rochester and occupied 285 acres (1.2 km2). The following year &quot;Rochester Airport&quot; was dedicated, and the Rochester Airport Company was founded as a subsidiary of the Mayo Foundation. Northwest Airlines began running Ford Trimotors to Rochester from St. Paul. Rochester was one of the first destinations from the Twin Cities in Northwest Airlines history, behind Chicago, Winnipeg, Green Bay, and Fargo.

In 1940, the runways were paved and more land was acquired, bringing the airport&#x27;s area to 370 acres (1.5 km2). During World War II, the Army Air Corps conducted training operations from the airport. In 1945, the Mayo Foundation gave the airport to the city of Rochester, but the Rochester Airport Company continued to operate the field under an agreement with the city. The airport was renamed Lobb Field in 1952. In 1960, it was decided to replace Lobb Field with a new airport southwest of town because it could not be expanded to allow larger airliners and was too close to the urban area of Rochester. The original Rochester Airport closed in 1961.

In 1960, Rochester Municipal Airport opened at its current location south of downtown Rochester; in 1965, runway 13 was 6400 feet and runway 2 was 4000 feet. Northwest and Braniff moved to the new airport in 1960, but Ozark&#x27;s DC-3s stayed at Lobb until 1961; North Central Airlines arrived in 1968, and Braniff left around the same time. The first jets were Northwest 727s in 1965.

American Airlines began service to O&#x27;Hare International Airport in 1988. 1995 saw the addition of a United States Customs Service post and it became the Rochester International Airport. Trans World Airlines operated flights to St. Louis in early-2001, but these routes were dropped very soon due to the merger with American Airlines. On September 15, 2005, the primary runway was lengthened from 7,533&#x27; to 9,034 following a three-month closure for renovations; runway centerline and touchdown zone lighting were added. The change was made to allow large wide body aircraft, which had been weight-restricted upon departure.

In 1970, Imperial Airways offered scheduled helicopter service to Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. On December 4, 1970, Imperial Airways announced it was canceling its scheduled helicopter flights in Minnesota, including from Minneapolis–St. Paul to Rochester.

In 2020, the airport received a $2,479,991 CARES Act award.

During the week of May 1, 2023, workers at the airport worked to rename runway 2/20 to 3/21. The renaming was caused by the magnetic north pole moving enough to change the orientation of the runway.

=== 2009 tarmac stranding incident ===
The Rochester International Airport was the site of the six-hour 2009 tarmac stranding incident that made international news and resulted in the first fines ever imposed on airline carriers by the United States Department of Transportation for stranding passengers on a tarmac.

=== Future ===
In March 2019, plans for construction of an additional gate and jet bridge were announced. The proposal for the addition came after a large increase in passengers the previous year and congestion. In July 2019, the Rochester Airport Commission began accepting bids for the jet bridge project. The commission also discussed repaving parts of runway 02/20 as well as additional dining and shopping options in the terminal. At the end of July 2019, the airport received $3.3 million in federal grants to improvements, including the jet bridge project and runway reconstruction.

In February 2020, the airport was awarded $750,000 by the United States Department of Transportation for attracting new service, with the federal grant&#x27;s stated purpose being &quot;revenue guarantee and marketing program to attract new service to Denver on United Airlines.&quot; Airport directors noted that the grant does not guarantee the new destination yet and also does not exclude possible other destinations. In August of 2022, the airport was awarded another $850,000 in a federal airport grant. This new grant is allowing for potential flights to Dallas on American Airlines.

==Airlines and destinations==

Airport directors are trying to get more service into Rochester. The directors have contacted two of the airline providers, American and Delta, about adding more destinations, and have also contacted United and Frontier, to bring new nonstop destinations. On February 26, 2017, United announced it was adding three daily flights to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare beginning June 8. The new flight was to compete with existing service from American Airlines. United later added service to Denver however these services proved unsuccessful in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and were discontinued in late 2021 as United exited the Rochester market entirely.

In August 2012, just days after Allegiant Air announced flights between Rochester and Phoenix (Allegiant Air has since dropped its Rochester service altogether), the United States Department of Transportation gave the airport $500,000 and the city of Rochester gave the airport $250,000 to help recruit more airlines and non-stop destinations.

On May 31, 2018, Elite Airways announced that they would be launching service direct to Phoenix, Arizona, and St. Augustine, Florida, starting in July 2018. This service was to allow Mayo Clinic staff, patients, and families to easily move back and forth between Mayo&#x27;s headquarters in Rochester and its other main facilities in the Phoenix and Jacksonville metropolitan areas. They ended the service on August 22, 2018, citing low bookings.

===Cargo destinations===
==Top destinations==
==General aviation facilities==
Rochester Aviation is the general aviation terminal at the airport. It is owned and operated by Hiawatha Aviation, Inc. The terminal provides line services, refueling services, and caters largely towards business aviation. On April 1, 2006, the ownership of Rochester Aviation was passed onto Regent Aviation of St. Paul. In November 2007, Regent Aviation in turn sold its ownership stake in Rochester&#x27;s general aviation terminal to Signature Flight Support, a worldwide fixed-base operator provider. Aircraft rental and flight instruction at RST are available through Great Planes Aviation, with various aircraft providing flight instruction with a group of certified flight instructors. The airport is also home to the Southeastern Minnesota Flying Club, which has had a presence at both RST and its predecessor Lobb Field for over 50 years.

==Access==
Transportation to Rochester International Airport is available from downtown Rochester via $30 taxi or $15 shuttle service. Rochester Yellow Cab, Rochester Taxi, and Med-City Taxi service the airport with both cabs and shuttles. Uber, Lyft, and other ride share apps are also available. Ground transportation to and from MSP airport is also available. Rochester Public Transit does not serve the airport.
==Accidents near RST==
* On December 8, 1985, a Learjet 35 operated by Corporate Air Inc, a training flight, rolled inverted and crashed after a missed approach. All three occupants died.

<text>CODASYL, the Conference/Committee on Data Systems Languages, was a consortium formed in 1959 to guide the development of a standard programming language that could be used on many computers. This effort led to the development of the programming language COBOL, the CODASYL Data Model, and other technical standards.

CODASYL&#x27;s members were individuals from industry and government involved in data processing activity. Its larger goal was to promote more effective data systems analysis, design, and implementation. The organization published specifications for various languages over the years, handing these over to official standards bodies (ISO, ANSI, or their predecessors) for formal standardization.

== History ==

CODASYL is remembered almost entirely for two activities: its work on the development of the COBOL language and its activities in standardizing database interfaces. It also worked on a wide range of other topics, including end-user form interfaces and operating system control languages, but these projects had little lasting impact.

The remainder of this section is concerned with CODASYL&#x27;s database activities.

In 1965 CODASYL formed a List Processing Task Force. This group was chartered to develop COBOL language extensions for processing collections of records; the name arose because Charles Bachman&#x27;s IDS system (which was the main technical input to the project) managed relationships between records using chains of pointers. In 1967 the group renamed itself the Data Base Task Group (DBTG), and its first report in January 1968 was entitled &quot;COBOL extensions to handle data bases&quot;.

 In October 1969 the DBTG published its first language specifications for the network database model which became generally known as the CODASYL Data Model. This specification in fact defined several separate languages: a data definition language (DDL) to define the schema of the database, another DDL to create one or more subschemas defining application views of the database; and a data manipulation language (DML) defining verbs for embedding in the COBOL programming language to request and update data in the database. Although the work was focused on COBOL, the idea of a host-language independent database was starting to emerge, prompted by IBM&#x27;s advocacy of PL/I as a COBOL replacement.

In 1971, largely in response to the need for programming language independence, the work was reorganized: development of the Data Description Language was continued by the Data Description Language Committee, while the COBOL DML was taken over by the COBOL language committee. With hindsight, this split had unfortunate consequences. The two groups never quite managed to synchronize their specifications, leaving vendors to patch up the differences. The inevitable consequence was a lack of interoperability among implementations.

A number of vendors implemented database products conforming (roughly) to the DBTG specifications: the best-known implementations were Honeywell&#x27;s—originally General Electric&#x27;s—Integrated Data Store (IDS/2), HP&#x27;s IMAGE, Cullinet&#x27;s Integrated Database Management System IDMS, ICL&#x27;s 2900 IDMS (derived from Cullinet&#x27;s product), Univac&#x27;s DMS-1100, and Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s DBMS for VMS (later known as Oracle Codasyl DBMS). Cullinet, originally known as Cullinane Database Systems, obtained the technology from B.F. Goodrich. Cullinet was eventually sold to Computer Associates, which as of 2007 still sells and supports a version of IDMS.

ANSI and ISO adopted the CODASYL database specifications under the name Network Database Language (NDL), with work taking place within the same working group (X3H2) as SQL standardization. An ISO standard for NDL was ratified as ISO 8907:1987, but, as it never had any practical effect on implementations, it was formally withdrawn in 1998.

Some of the CODASYL committees continue their work today, but CODASYL itself no longer exists. The records of CODASYL were donated to the Charles Babbage Institute. CBI also hold the archival records for American National Standards Institute X3H2 records.

Interest in CODASYL gradually faded due to growing interest in relational databases beginning in the early 1980s.

<doc id="309352" wikidata="Q1470492" url="?curid=309352" title="The Allisons">
<text>The Allisons were an English pop duo consisting of Bob Day (born Bernard Colin Day; 2 February 1941 – 25 November 2013) and John Alford (born Brian Henry John Alford, 31 December 1939 – Died 2023). They were marketed as being brothers, using the surname of Allison.

==Career==
The Allisons represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1961 with the song &quot;Are You Sure?&quot;. They came second with 24 points. The song was released as a single on the Fontana label, and climbed to number 1 on the UK &quot;NME&quot; pop chart, while in the chart compiled by the Official Charts Company the song spent six weeks at number 2 and a further three weeks in the top 4. &quot;Are You Sure&quot; sold over one million records, earning a gold disc. In Germany the single reached number 11. Despite a couple of minor follow-up hits, the duo disbanded in 1963.

Alford initially tried songwriting, but he and Day teamed up for short tours to keep the &#x27;Allisons&#x27; name alive. Additionally, in the 1970s and 1980s Alford was joined by other &quot;brothers&quot; — Mike &quot;Allison&quot; and Tony &quot;Allison&quot;. By the 1990s, Day and Alford regularly reunited to perform on the oldies circuit.

The Allisons&#x27; final public performance was at the &quot;Tales from the Woods&quot; British R&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Heritage Show #8 at The Borderline Club in London, 2012. A clip from that show can be found on the &#x27;Tales From The Woods&#x27; YouTube channel

Bob Day died on 25 November 2013, aged 72, after a long illness.
