<text>Oryx ( ) is a genus consisting of four large antelope species called oryxes. Their pelage is pale with contrasting dark markings in the face and on the legs, and their long horns are almost straight and annulated. The exception is the scimitar oryx, which lacks dark markings on the legs, only has faint dark markings on the head, has an ochre neck, and has horns that are clearly decurved. All oryx species prefer near-desert conditions and can survive without water for long periods.

The Arabian oryx was only saved from extinction through a captive-breeding program and reintroduction to the wild. The scimitar oryx, which was listed as extinct in the wild, also relied on a captive-breeding program for its survival.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;oryx&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;óryx&quot; meaning &quot;pickaxe&quot;, because its long and pointed horns look similar to the tool&#x27;s end. The Greek plural form is &quot;óryges&quot;, although &quot;oryxes&quot; has been established in English. Herodotus mentions a type of gazelle in Libya called ὄρυς, &quot;orus&quot;, probably related to the verb ὀρύσσω, &quot;orussō&quot;, or ὀρύττω, &quot;oruttō&quot;, meaning &quot;to dig&quot;. White oryxes are known to dig holes in the sand.

==Species==

===Arabian oryx===
The Arabian oryx (&quot;Oryx leucoryx&quot;, Arabic: المها), became extinct in the wild in 1972 in the Arabian Peninsula. It was reintroduced in 1982 in Oman, but poaching has reduced its numbers there. One of the largest populations of Arabian oryxes exists on Sir Bani Yas Island in the United Arab Emirates. Additional populations have been reintroduced in Qatar, Bahrain, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. As of 2011, the total wild population is over 1,000, and 6,000–7,000 are being held in captivity. In 2011, the IUCN downgraded its threat category from extinct in the wild to vulnerable, the first species to have changed back in this way.

===Scimitar oryx===
The scimitar oryx, also called the scimitar-horned oryx (&quot;Oryx dammah&quot;), of North Africa used to be listed as extinct in the wild, but it is now declared as endangered. Unconfirmed surviving populations have been reported in central Niger and Chad, and a semi-wild population currently inhabiting a fenced nature reserve in Tunisia is being expanded for reintroduction to the wild in that country. Several thousand are held in captivity around the world.

===East African oryx and gemsbok===
The East African oryx (&quot;Oryx beisa&quot;) inhabits eastern Africa and the closely related gemsbok (&quot;Oryx gazella&quot;) inhabits southern Africa. The gemsbok is monotypic and the East African oryx has two subspecies; the common beisa oryx (&quot;O. b. beisa&quot;) and the fringe-eared oryx (&quot;O. b. callotis&quot;). In the past, both were considered subspecies of the gemsbok. The East African oryx is an endangered species, whereas the gemsbok is not.

Gemsbok were introduced in New Mexico by the Department of Game and Fish in the late 1960s and early 1970s as an experiment in offering a unique hunting opportunity to New Mexico residents. Between 1969 and 1973, 95 oryx were released onto White Sands Missile Range. White Sands Missile Range, located between the cities of Albuquerque, NM and El Paso, TX, is a 3,200 square mile US Army facility which also hosts White Sands National Park. Researchers believed that the population would never grow beyond 500 to 600 and would remain within the Tularosa Basin. However, the animals proved to be extremely opportunistic, and quickly spread into the San Andres Mountains to the north and west of Tularosa Basin. 

At one time, numbers of oryx in New Mexico were estimated to be around 6,000 (original release numbers were less than 100). Today, numbers have been held around the 2,000 mark through managed hunting efforts. The success of the oryx in New Mexico is due in part to the abundance of food. In Africa, they eat grasses, forbs, and melons. In New Mexico, they feed on desert grasses, yucca, buffalo gourds, and mesquite bean pods. They are especially adapted to desert life and can go a long time without drinking water. This area also lacks a way to control the population. Lions and other natural predators cull the population in Africa, with only 10% of calves reaching one year of age. In New Mexico, predators like coyotes and mountain lions are not effective at controlling numbers, allowing the oryx to reproduce without restriction. 


==Classification==

** Subfamily Hippotraginae
*** Genus &quot;Oryx&quot;
**** Scimitar oryx, &quot;O. dammah&quot;

***** Common beisa oryx, &quot;O. b. beisa&quot;
***** Fringe-eared oryx, &quot;O. b. callotis&quot;
**** Arabian oryx, &quot;O. leucoryx&quot;

==Ecology==
They live in herds of up to 600 animals. Newborn calves are able to run with the herd immediately after birth. Both males and females possess permanent horns. The horns are narrow and straight except in the scimitar oryx, where they curve backwards like a scimitar. The horns can be lethal: oryxes have been known to kill lions with them, and they are thus sometimes called sabre antelopes (not to be confused with the sable antelope). The horns also make the animals a prized game trophy, which has led to the near-extinction of the two northern species.

=== As an introduced species ===
Between 1969 and 1977, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish in the US intentionally released 95 gemsbok into its state&#x27;s White Sands Missile Range and that population is now estimated between 3,000 and 6,000 animals. Within the state of New Mexico, oryxes are classified as &quot;big game&quot; and can be hunted.

==Oryxes in popular culture==
The oryx is the national animal of Namibia and Qatar, Qatar&#x27;s airline company Qatar Airways has an oryx as its logo.

The main boss of the MMO game &quot;Realm of the Mad God&quot; is Oryx the Mad God, named after the creator of the original sprite sheets, Oryx. His four direct subordinates also bear the names of four South African species of oryx.

Oryxes appear briefly, along with many other species of animal, in the Talk Talk music video &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;.

In the video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot;, a playable defending operator nicknamed Oryx was introduced in Year 5 Season 1. His ability is called &quot;Remah Dash,&quot; where he can charge to break holes in walls and knock down enemies.

Oryx is a nickname for a character in Margaret Atwood&#x27;s book &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;.

Oryx is also the main antagonist’s name in the video game &quot;&quot;, a god who seeks vengeance on the player, known as a Guardian, after they killed his son Crota. He is killed by the player in the raid &quot;King’s Fall&quot;. He is portrayed as &quot;Oryx, the Taken King&quot;.

The Oryx is mentioned in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, in which he writes, &quot;There is a wild beast, named by the Egyptians Oryx, which, when the star [Sirius] rises, is said to stand opposite to it, to look steadfastly at it, and then to sneeze, as if it were worshiping it.&quot;

In the 1994 film and 2019 remake of &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;, the two species of oryxes in Hell&#x27;s Gate National Park are the East African oryx and gemsbok.

<doc id="314909" wikidata="Q142059" url="?curid=314909" title="Julius Fučík (journalist)">
<text>Julius Fučík () (23 February 1903 – 8 September 1943) was a Czech journalist, critic, writer, and active member of Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. For his part at the forefront of the anti-Nazi resistance during the Second World War, he was imprisoned and tortured by the Gestapo in Prague, and executed in Berlin. While in prison, Fučík recorded his interrogation experiences on small pieces of paper, which were smuggled out and published after the war as &quot;Notes from the Gallows&quot;. The book established Fučík as a symbol of resistance to oppression, as well as an icon of communist propaganda.

== Early life ==
Julius Fučík was born into a working-class family in Prague. His father was a steelworker and opera singer, and his uncle and namesake was the composer Julius Fučík. In 1913, Fučík moved with his family from Prague to Plzeň (Pilsen) where he attended the state vocational high school. Already as a twelve-year-old boy he was planning to establish a newspaper named &quot;Slovan&quot; (The Slav). He showed himself to be interested in both politics and literature. As a teenager he frequently acted in local amateur theatre.

== Journalism and politics ==
In 1920 he took up study in Prague and joined the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party, through which he was later to find himself swept up in the left-wing current. In May 1921 this wing founded the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPC). Fučík then first wrote cultural contributions for the local Plzeň CPC newspaper.

After completing his studies, Fučík found a position as an editor with the literary newspaper &quot;Kmen&quot; (&quot;Stem&quot;). Within the CPC he became responsible for cultural work. He was a member of the literary and artistic group Devětsil from 1926 and in 1929 helped the creation of its more politically motivated successor, Left Front. In the year 1929 he went to literary critic František Xaver Šalda&#x27;s magazine &quot;Tvorba&quot; (&quot;Creation&quot;). Moreover, he constantly worked on the CPC newspaper &quot;Rudé právo&quot; (&quot;Red Right&quot;) and several other journals. In this time Fučík was arrested repeatedly by the Czechoslovak Secret Police, managing to avoid an eight-month prison sentence in 1934.

In 1930, he visited the Soviet Union for four months, including the Czechoslovak collectivist colony Interhelpo in Central Asia, and painted a very positive picture of the situation there in the book &quot;V zemi, kde zítra již znamená včera&quot; (&quot;In a Land, Where Tomorrow is Already Yesterday&quot;, published in 1932). Fučík supported collectivization, and dekulakization; praised the successes of industrialization, and emphasized the temporary nature of all difficulties. In particular, having visited the USSR on the eve of the Holodomor of 1932-1933, he categorically supported the policy of the Soviet regime. In July 1934, just after Adolf Hitler had suppressed the SA, he visited Bavaria and described his experiences in &quot;Cesta do Mnichova&quot; (&quot;The Road to Munich&quot;). He went to the Soviet Union again in 1934, this time for two years, and wrote various reports, which again worked to support the Party&#x27;s strength. After his return, there were heated arguments with authors such as Jiří Weil and Jan Slavík, who criticized developments under Joseph Stalin. Fučík took the Stalinist side and criticized such statements critical of Stalin as fatal to the CPC.

In 1938 Fučík married Augusta Kodeřičová, later known as Gusta Fučíková.

In the wake of the Munich Conference, the Prague government disbanded the CPC from September 1938 and the CPC went underground. After Nazi Germany&#x27;s troops invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Fučík moved to his parents&#x27; house in Chotiměř (Litoměřice District) and published in civilian newspapers, especially about historical and literary topics. He also started to work for the now underground CPC. In 1940 the Gestapo started to search for him in Chotiměř because of his cooperation with the CPC, and so he decided to move back to Prague.

Beginning early in 1941, he belonged to the CPC&#x27;s Central Committee. He provided handbills and tried to publish the Communist Party newspaper &quot;Rudé Právo&quot; regularly. On 24 April 1942 he and six others were arrested in Prague by the Gestapo, probably rather coincidentally during a police raid. Although Fučík had two guns at the time, he did not use them. The only survivor of the incident, Riva Friedová-Krieglová, claimed in the 1990s that Fučík had orders to shoot himself to avoid capture.

== &quot;Notes from the Gallows&quot; ==

Fučík was initially detained in Pankrác Prison in Prague, where he was interrogated and tortured. In this time he composed &quot;Notes from the Gallows&quot; (, literally &quot;Reports Written Under the Noose&quot;), by writing on pieces of cigarette paper and smuggling them out with the help of sympathetic prison warders named Kolínský and Hora.

The book describes events in the prison and is filled with hope for a communist future. He also details mental resistance techniques to help withstand torture, which have since been used by activists around the world.

In the original edition, certain passages that jarred with common notions of heroic resistance were omitted. A later edition, published in 1995, restored the missing text. 

Although the work&#x27;s authenticity has been contested, a forensic analysis by the Prague Institute of Criminalistics found the manuscript to be genuine.

== Trial and death ==
In May 1943 Fučík was brought to Germany. He was first detained in Bautzen for somewhat more than two months, and afterwards in Berlin. On 25 August 1943 in Berlin, he was accused of high treason in connection with his political activities by the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot;, which was presided over by the notorious Roland Freisler. Fučík was found guilty and was sentenced to death along with Jaroslav Klecan, who had been arrested with Fučík. Fučík was hanged two weeks later on 8 September 1943 in Plötzensee Prison in Berlin (not beheaded as is often stated).

After the war, his wife, Gusta Fučíková, who had also been in a Nazi concentration camp, researched and retrieved all of his prison writings. She edited them with help of CPC and published them as &quot;Notes from the Gallows&quot; in 1947. The book was successful, and its influence increased after the Stalinist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948. It has been translated into at least 90 languages.

== Fučík as an ideological symbol ==

The Party found Julius Fučík and his book convenient for use as propaganda and turned them into one of the most visible symbols of the Party. The book was required reading in schools and by the age of 10 every pupil growing up in communist Czechoslovakia was familiar with Fučík&#x27;s work and life. Fučík became a hero whose portrait was displayed at political meetings. Gusta Fučíková was given a high position in the Party hierarchy (the chairmanship of a women&#x27;s organization), holding it for decades.

Many places were named after Fučík, among them a large entertainment park in Prague (&quot;Park kultury a oddechu Julia Fučíka&quot;), the city theatre in Jablonec nad Nisou (1945–98), a factory in Brno (&quot;Elektrotechnické závody Julia Fučíka&quot;), a military unit, and countless streets and squares. In December 2022 the Julius Fučík street in Kyiv, Ukraine was renamed to Karel Čapek street.

In 1955, Milan Kundera published a poetic tale entitled &quot;Poslední máj&quot; (&quot;The Last May&quot;) that depicts an encounter between Fučík and his Nazi interrogators.

The &quot;Julius Fučík&quot; (&quot;Юлиус Фучик&quot;) was a Soviet and later Russian barge carrier. In Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, about a hypothetical war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO, this ship was given the role of being used for the Soviet invasion of Iceland.

The composer Luigi Nono wrote a musical piece titled &quot;Julius Fučík&quot; based on &quot;Notes from the Gallows&quot;.

== References in popular culture ==
The position and reverence of Fučík during Communist Czechoslovakia is depicted by Milan Kundera in his book &quot;The Joke&quot; from 1967. There he describes how the portrait of Fučík hangs in public buildings where public expulsions from the Communist Party took place, and how Fučík&#x27;s book is recited and used as propaganda by the Communist party.

&quot;I recognized Fučík&#x27;s Notes from the Gallows...That text, written clandestinely in prison, then published after the war in a million copies, broadcast over the radio, studied in schools as required reading, was the sacred book of the era.&quot;

== Reassessment ==
After the Party lost its power in 1989, the legend of Fučík became a target of scrutiny. It was made public that some parts of the book &quot;Notes from the Gallows&quot; (around 2%) had been omitted and that the text had been &quot;sanitized&quot; by Gusta Fučíková. There were speculations as to how much information he gave his torturers, and whether he had turned traitor. In 1995 the complete text of the book was published. The part in which Fučík describes how he succumbed to torture was published for the first time. In it, one learns that Fučík gave false information to his captors, saving countless lives among the Czech resistance to the Nazis. The historian Alena Hájková coedited the critical edition of Fučík&#x27;s memoir.

<text>Myxozoa (etymology: Greek: μύξα &quot;myxa&quot; &quot;slime&quot; or &quot;mucus&quot; + thematic vowel o + ζῷον &quot;zoon&quot; &quot;animal&quot;) is a subphylum of aquatic cnidarian animals – all obligate parasites. It contains the smallest animals ever known to have lived. Over 2,180 species have been described and some estimates have suggested at least 30,000 undiscovered species. Many have a two-host lifecycle, involving a fish and an annelid worm or a bryozoan. The average size of a myxosporean spore usually ranges from 10 μm to 20 μm, whereas that of a malacosporean (a subclade of the Myxozoa) spore can be up to 2 mm. Myxozoans can live in both freshwater and marine habitats.

Myxozoans are highly derived cnidarians that have undergone dramatic evolution from a free swimming, self-sufficient jellyfish-like creature into their current form of obligate parasites composed of very few cells. As myxozoans evolved into microscopic parasites, they lost many genes responsible for multicellular development, coordination, cell–cell communication, and even, in some cases, aerobic respiration. The genomes of some myxozoans are now among the smallest genomes of any known animal species.

==Life cycle and pathology==
Myxozoans are endoparasitic animals exhibiting complex life cycles that, in most of the documented cases, involve an intermediate host, usually a fish, but in rare cases amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals; and a definitive host, usually an annelid or an ectoproct.
Only about 100 life cycles have been resolved and it is suspected that there may be some exclusively terrestrial. The mechanism of infection occurs through valve spores that have many forms, but their main morphology is the same: one or two sporoplasts, which are the real infectious agent, surrounded by a layer of flattened cells called valve cells, which can secrete a layer protective coating and form float appendages. Integrated into the layer of valve cells are two to four specialized capsulogenic cells (in a few cases, one or even 15), each carrying a polar capsule containing coiled polar filaments, an extrudable organelle used for recognition, contact and infiltration. Myxospores are ingested by annelids, in which the polar filaments extrude to anchor the spore to the gut epithelium. Opening of the shell valves allows the sporoplasms to penetrate into the epithelium. Subsequently, the parasite undergoes reproduction and development in the gut tissue, and finally produces usually eight actinosporean spore stages (actinospores) within a pansporocyst. After mature actinospores are released from their hosts they float in the water column. Upon contact with skin or gills of fish, sporoplasms penetrate through the epithelium, followed by development of the myxosporean stage. Myxosporean trophozoites are characterized by cell-in-cell state, where the secondary (daughter) cells develop in the mother (primary) cells. The presporogonic stages multiply, migrate via nervous or circulatory systems, and develop into sporogonic stages. At the final site of infection, they produce mature spores within mono- or di-sporic pseudoplasmodia, or poly-sporic plasmodia.

Relationships between myxosporeans and their hosts are often highly evolved and do not usually result in severe diseases of the natural host. Infection in fish hosts can be extremely long-lasting, potentially persisting for the lifetime of the host. However, an increasing number of myxosporeans have become pathogens with significant impact to the commercial fish industry, largely as a result of aquaculture bringing new species into contact with myxosporeans to which they had not been previously exposed, and to which they are highly susceptible. The economic impact of such parasites can be severe, especially where prevalence rates are high; they may also have a severe impact on wild fish stocks.

The diseases caused by myxosporeas in cultured fish with the most significant economic impact worldwide are proliferative kidney disease (PKD) caused by the malacosporean &quot;T. bryosalmonae&quot;, and whirling disease, caused by a myxosporean &quot;M. cerebralis&quot;; both diseases affect salmon. Enteromyxosis is caused by &quot;E. leei&quot; in cultured marine sparids, while proliferative gill disease (or “hamburger disease”) is caused by &quot;H. ictaluri&quot; in catfish and &quot;S. renicola&quot; infections occur in common carp.

== Anatomy ==
Myxozoans are very small animals, typically 10–300 μm in length.

Like other cnidarians they possess cnidocysts, which were referred to as &quot;polar capsules&quot; before the discovery that myxozoans are cnidarians. These cnidocysts fire tubules as in other cnidarians; some inject substances into the host. However, the tubules lack hooks or barbs, and in some species are more elastic than in other cnidarians.

Myxozoans have secondarily lost epithelial structures, a nervous system, gut, and cilia. Most lack muscles, though these are retained in some members of malacosporea. Those who have lost their muscles move around inside the host using other forms of locomotion, such as the use of filopodia, spore valve contractions, amoeboid movements, and rapidly creating and reabsorbing folds on the cell membrane. Myxozoans do not undergo embryogenesis during development and have lost true gametes. Instead, they reproduce via multicellular spores. These spores contain the polar capsules, which are not typically present in somatic cells. Centrioles are not involved in the nuclear division of myxozoans. Cell division by binary fission is rare, and cells divide instead via endogeny.

In 2020, the myxozoan &quot;Henneguya salminicola&quot; was found to lack a mitochondrial genome, and thus be incapable of aerobic respiration; it was the first animal to be positively identified as such. Its actual metabolism is currently unknown.

==Phylogenetics==
Myxozoans were originally considered to be protozoans, and were included among other non-motile forms in the group Sporozoa. As their distinct nature became clear through 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing, they were relocated in the metazoa. Detailed classification within the metazoa was however long hindered by conflicting rDNA evidence: although 18S rDNA suggested an affinity with Cnidaria, other rDNA sampled, and the HOX genes of two species, were more similar to those of the Bilateria.

The discovery that &quot;Buddenbrockia plumatellae&quot;, a worm-like parasite of bryozoans up to 2 mm in length, is a myxozoan initially appeared to strengthen the case for a bilaterian origin, as the body plan is superficially similar. Nevertheless, closer examination reveals that &quot;Buddenbrockia&quot; longitudinal symmetry is not twofold, but fourfold, casting doubt on this hypothesis.

Further testing resolved the genetic conundrum by sourcing the first three previously identified discrepant HOX genes (&quot;Myx1-3&quot;) to the bryozoan &quot;Cristatella mucedo&quot; and the fourth (&quot;Myx4&quot;) to northern pike, the respective hosts of the two corresponding Myxozoa samples. This explained the confusion: the original experiments had used samples contaminated by tissue from host organisms, leading to false positives for a position among the Bilateria. More careful cloning of 50 coding genes from &quot;Buddenbrockia&quot; firmly established the clade as severely modified members of the phylum Cnidaria, with medusozoans as their closest relatives. Similarities between myxozoan polar capsules and cnidarian nematocysts had been drawn for a long time, but were generally assumed to be the result of convergent evolution.

Taxonomists now recognize the outdated subgroup Actinosporea as a life-cycle phase of Myxosporea.

Molecular clocks suggest that myxozoans and their closest relatives, the polypodiozoa, shared their last common ancestor with medusazoans about 600 million years ago, during the Ediacaran period.

==Taxonomy==
Myxozoan taxonomy has undergone great and important changes in its levels of generic, family and suborder classification. Fiala et al. (2015) proposed a new classification based on spores.

<text>Richard Foxe (sometimes Richard Fox) ( 1448 – 5 October 1528) was an English churchman, the founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He was successively Bishop of Exeter, Bath and Wells, Durham, and Winchester, and became also Lord Privy Seal.

==Life==

Foxe was born at Ropsley near Grantham, Lincolnshire. His parents belonged to the yeoman class, and little is known about Foxe&#x27;s early career. He is thought to have studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, from which he drew many members of his subsequent foundation, Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Foxe also appears to have studied at Cambridge, but nothing definite is known of his first thirty-five years. He was Master of the school in Stratford-upon-Avon from 1477, &quot;a man of wisdom, knowledge, learning and truth.&quot;

In 1484, Foxe was in Paris possibly in pursuit of studies or possibly because he had become unpopular with Richard III. There he came into contact with Henry Tudor, who was beginning his quest for the English throne, and took Foxe into his service. In January 1485 Richard intervened to prevent Foxe&#x27;s appointment to the vicarage of Stepney on the ground that he was keeping company with the &quot;great rebel, Henry ap Tuddor.&quot;

The important offices conferred on Foxe immediately after the Battle of Bosworth imply that he had already seen more extensive political service than can be traced in surviving records. His Tudor credentials immediately confirmed by ordination as Vicar of Stepney. Doubtless Henry had every reason to reward his companions in exile, and to rule like Ferdinand II of Aragon by means of lawyers and churchmen rather than to trust nobles like those who had made the Wars of the Roses. But without an intimate knowledge of Foxe&#x27;s political experience and capacity he would hardly have made him his principal secretary, and soon afterwards Lord Privy Seal and elected Bishop of Exeter on 29 January 1487, being consecrated on 8 April. The ecclesiastical role provided a salary that was not at Henry&#x27;s expense; for Foxe never saw either Exeter or the diocese of Bath and Wells to which he was moved in February 1492. His activity was confined to political and especially diplomatic channels; during John Morton&#x27;s lifetime, Foxe was his subordinate, but after the archbishop&#x27;s death he was first in Henry&#x27;s confidence, and had an important share in all the diplomatic work of the reign. In 1487 he negotiated a treaty with King James III of Scotland, also pursuing the possibility of a marriage alliance involving one of Elizabeth of York&#x27;s sisters. In 1491 he baptised the future King Henry VIII of England. In 1492 he helped conclude the Peace of Etaples, and in 1493 he was chief commissioner in the negotiations for the famous commercial agreement with the Netherlands which Bacon seems to have been the first to call the Magnus Intercursus.
Meanwhile, in July 1494 Foxe had been translated to the see of Durham, not merely because it was a richer see than Bath and Wells but because of its political importance as a palatine see and its location adjacent to the Borders and hence its importance for relations with Scotland. For these reasons rather than from any ecclesiastical scruples Foxe visited and resided in his new diocese; and he occupied Norham Castle, which he fortified and defended against a Scottish raid launched in 1497 in support of Perkin Warbeck. But his energies were principally devoted to pacific purposes. In that same year he negotiated Perkin&#x27;s retirement from the court of James IV, and in 1498–1499 he completed the negotiations for that treaty of marriage between the Scottish king and Henry VII&#x27;s daughter Margaret which led ultimately to the union of the two crowns in 1603 and of the two kingdoms in 1707. The marriage itself did not take place until 1503, just a century before the accession of James I.

In August 1501 he was translated once more, this time to the see of Winchester, then reputed the richest diocese in England. In that year he brought to a conclusion marriage negotiations not less momentous in their ultimate results, when Prince Arthur was betrothed to Catherine of Aragon. His last diplomatic achievement in the reign of Henry VII was the betrothal of the king&#x27;s younger daughter Mary to the future emperor Charles V.

In 1500 Foxe was elected chancellor of Cambridge University and in 1507 master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. Lady Margaret Beaufort made him one of her executors, and in this capacity as well as in that of chancellor, he had the chief share with Fisher in regulating the foundation of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and the Lady Margaret professorships and readerships. His financial work brought him a less enviable notoriety, though history has deprived him of the credit which is his due for &quot;Morton&#x27;s Fork.&quot; The invention of that ingenious dilemma for extorting contributions from poor and rich alike is ascribed as a tradition to Morton by Francis Bacon; but the story is told in greater detail of Foxe by Erasmus, who says he had it from Sir Thomas More. It is in keeping with the somewhat malicious saying about Foxe, reported by William Tyndale, that he would sacrifice his father to save his king.

The accession of Henry VIII only increased Foxe&#x27;s power, the personnel of his ministry remaining unaltered. The Venetian ambassador called Foxe &quot;alter rex&quot; and the Spanish ambassador Carroz said that Henry trusted him more than any other adviser, although he also reports Henry&#x27;s warning that the Bishop of Winchester was, as his name implied, &quot;a Foxe indeed.&quot; He was the chief of the ecclesiastical statesmen of Morton&#x27;s school, believed in frequent parliaments, and opposed the spirited foreign policy which laymen like Surrey are supposed to have advocated. His colleagues were William Warham and Ruthal, but Warham and Foxe differed on the question of Henry&#x27;s marriage, Foxe advising the completion of the match with Catherine of Aragon while Warham expressed doubts as to its canonical validity. They also differed over the prerogatives of Canterbury with regard to probate and other questions of ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

Thomas Wolsey&#x27;s rapid rise in 1511 put an end to Foxe&#x27;s influence. The pacific policy of the first two years of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign was succeeded by a more aggressive foreign policy directed mainly against France; and Foxe complained that no one dared do anything in opposition to Wolsey&#x27;s wishes. Foxe resigned the privy seal because of Wolsey&#x27;s ill-advised attempt to drive King Francis I of France out of Milan by financing an expedition led by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1516. Cuthbert Tunstall protested, Wolsey took Warham&#x27;s place as chancellor, and Foxe was succeeded by Ruthal, who, said the Venetian ambassador, &quot;sang treble to Wolsey&#x27;s bass.&quot; Yet he warmly congratulated Wolsey two years later when warlike adventures were abandoned at the peace of London. But in 1522, when war was again declared, he emphatically refused to bear any part of the responsibility, and in 1523 he opposed in convocation the financial demands which met with a more strenuous resistance in the House of Commons.

Foxe now devoted himself to his long-neglected episcopal duties. He expressed himself as being as anxious for the reformation of the clergy as Simeon the Righteous for the coming of the Messiah; but was too old to accomplish much himself in the way of remedying the clerical and especially the monastic depravity, licence and corruption he deplored. His sight failed during the last ten years of his life, and Matthew Parker claimed that Wolsey suggested his retirement from his diocese on a pension. Foxe refused, and Wolsey had to wait until Foxe&#x27;s death before he could add occupation of Winchester to his holding the archdiocese of York and the abbey of St Albans, and thus leave Durham vacant as he hoped for his own illegitimate son. Foxe died on 5 October 1528.

The crown of Foxe&#x27;s career was his foundation of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, which he established in 1515–1516, and which was roundly praised by humanist Erasmus. Originally he intended it as an Oxford house for the monks of St Swithin&#x27;s, Winchester; but he is said to have been dissuaded by Bishop Oldham, who foretold the fall of the monks. The scheme breathed the spirit of the Renaissance; provision was made for the teaching of Greek, Latin and patristic texts. While Erasmus praised the institution, Pole was one of its earliest fellows. The humanist Juan Luís Vives was brought from Italy to teach Latin, and the reader in theology was instructed to follow the Greek and Latin Fathers rather than the scholastic commentaries. Foxe also built and endowed grammar schools at Taunton and Grantham and was a benefactor to numerous other institutions. He died at Wolvesey; Corpus possesses several portraits and other relics of its founder.

<doc id="314917" wikidata="Q316357" url="?curid=314917" title="Juan Luis Vives">
<text>Juan Luis Vives y March (; ; ; 6 March 6 May 1540) was a Spanish (Valencian) scholar and Renaissance humanist who spent most of his adult life in the southern Habsburg Netherlands. His beliefs on the soul, insight into early medical practice, and perspective on emotions, memory and learning earned him the title of the &quot;father&quot; of modern psychology. Vives was the first to shed light on some key ideas that established how psychology is perceived today.

==Early life==
Luis Vives was born in Valencia to a &quot;converso&quot; family which had converted from Judaism to Christianity, in the case of his mother&#x27;s side of the family, several decades before the Alhambra Decree. 

While still in Spain, he attended the University of Valencia (Estudi General), where he was taught by Jerome Amiguetus and Daniel Siso. Vives later recalled that the school was dominated by scholasticism, with the dialectic and disputation playing a central role in delivering of education:

Even the youngest scholars are accustomed never to keep silence; they are always asserting vigorously whatever comes uppermost to their minds, lest they should seem to be giving up the dispute. Nor does one disputation, or even two a day prove sufficient, as for instance at dinner. They wrangle at breakfast; they wrangle after breakfast; they wrangle before supper and they wrangle after supper. At home they dispute, out of doors they dispute. They wrangle over their food, in the bath, in the sweating room, in the church, in the town, in the country, in public, in private. At all times they are wrangling.

His mother, Blanquina, born 1473, was investigated by the Inquisition for the heresies of being a Marrano and a Judaizer in 1491. She admitted that as a girl of nine, her own mother had insisted following their conversion that their family continue to celebrate Yom Kippur. On displaying that she was able and willing to recite the Nicene Creed, she was acquitted. She died of the plague in 1508, when Vives was 15 years old; in 1509 he left Spain never to return. 

In around 1524, Vives&#x27; father, grandmother, and great-grandfather, as well as several other members of their wider family, were convicted and executed by the Inquisition for Crypto-Judaism, after his uncle was caught hosting a secret synagogue inside his house.

A few years later (c. 1528), allegedly to avoid providing doweries to Vives&#x27; sisters, local authorities brought up their mother&#x27;s heresy investigation once again. Based on her own Yom Kippur testimony, Blanquina Vives&#x27; corpse was re-exhumed and posthumously burned at the stake. Even though his own belief in Roman Catholicism was very genuine and sincere, Vives was living at the time in Thomas More&#x27;s house in Chelsea and entered a severe depressive state.

==Academic career==

Vives studied at the University of Paris from 1509 to 1512, and in 1519 was appointed professor of humanities at the University of Leuven. At the insistence of his friend Erasmus, he prepared an elaborate commentary on Augustine&#x27;s &quot;De Civitate Dei&quot;, which was published in 1522 with a dedication to Henry VIII of England. Soon afterwards, he was invited to England, and acted as tutor to the Princess Mary, for whose use he wrote &quot;De ratione studii puerilis epistolae duae&quot; (1523) and, ostensibly, &quot;De Institutione Feminae Christianae&quot;, on Christian education for young women and which Vives dedicated to Queen Catherine of Aragon.

While in England, he resided at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where Erasmus had strong ties. Vives was made doctor of laws and lectured on philosophy. Once he sided in 1528 with his patroness and openly declared himself against the annulment of the marriage between Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, Vives immediately fell from royal favour and was confined to his house for six weeks.

==Later life==
On his release, he returned to Bruges, where he devoted the rest of his life to the composition of numerous ethical and philosophical writings, chiefly directed against the unquestioning authority of scholasticism within some circles, and of Aristotle in others. The most important of his treatises is the &quot;De Causis Corruptarum Artium&quot;, which has been ranked with Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Novum Organon&quot;.

His most important pedagogic work are &quot;Introductio ad sapientiam&quot; (1524); &quot;De disciplinis&quot;, which stressed the urgent importance of more rational programs of education and studying; &quot;De prima philosophia&quot;; and the &quot;Exercitatio linguae latinae&quot;, which is a Latin textbook consisting of a series of brilliant dialogues. His philosophical works include &quot;De anima et vita&quot; (1538), &quot;De veritate fidei Christianae&quot;; and &quot;De Subventione Pauperum Sive de Humanis Necessitatibus&quot; (On Assistance To The Poor) (1526), the first tract of its kind in the Western world to treat the problem of urban poverty and propose concrete suggestions for a State policy of poverty relief and reduction. Vives detected through philological analysis that the author of the Letter of Aristeas, which describes the making of the Pre-Christian translation of the Old Testament into Koine Greek as the Septuagint, could not have been a contemporary ethnic Greek but must have been a Jewish writer who lived long after the events he described.

He died in Bruges in 1540, at the age of 47, and was buried in St. Donatian&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Contemporary relevance==

Vives imagined and described a comprehensive theory of education. He may have directly influenced the essays of Michel Eyquem de Montaigne as well as John Henry Newman. His writings were also admired by his close friends Thomas More and Erasmus, who wrote that Vives &quot;will overshadow the name of Erasmus.&quot;

Vives is considered the first scholar to analyze the psyche directly. He did extensive interviews with people, and noted the relation between their exhibition of affect and the particular words they used and the issues they were discussing. While it is unknown if Sigmund Freud was familiar with Vives&#x27;s work, historian of psychiatry Gregory Zilboorg considered Vives a godfather of psychoanalysis. (&quot;A History of Medical Psychology&quot;, 1941) and the father of modern psychology by Foster Watson (1915.)
Vives taught monarchs. His idea of a diverse and concrete children&#x27;s education long preceded those of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and may have indirectly influenced Rousseau through he essays of Montaigne.

However influential he may have been in the 16th century, Vives now attracts minimal interest beyond specialized academic fields. The values of Vives inspired two Belgian Schools for higher education (KATHO and Katholieke Hogeschool Brugge-Oostende) to choose the name &#x27;Vives&#x27; as the name for their cooperation/merger starting from September 2013. Also, the regional link of Vives with the province of West Flanders, of which Bruges is the capital, played a role.

===State assistance for those in poverty===
During the Middle Ages, poor relief was usually the responsibility of the Church and individuals through almsgiving. As society became more advanced, these efforts became inadequate. In 1525, the Dutch city of Bruges requested Vives to suggest means to address the issue of relief for the poor. He set out his views in his essay &quot;De Subventione Pauperum Sive de Humanis Necessitatibus&quot; (On Assistance To The Poor). Vives argued that the state had a responsibility to provide some level of financial relief for the poor, as well as craft training for the unskilled poor, but considered that a &quot;right to laziness&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist. 

The city of Bruges did not implement Vives&#x27;s suggestions until 1557, but his proposals influenced social relief legislation enacted in England, the German Empire and the Spanish Kingsom during the 1530s, despite critics of other thinkers and theologians.

===On gender roles and responsibilities===
Some recent feminist and gender studies scholars have accused Vives of altering classical rhetoric to express a sort of &quot;half-feminism&quot;. Among 16th century Spanish Renaissance humanism&#x27;s numerous &quot;treatises for and against women,&quot; some modern scholars have alleged that Vives &quot;steer[ed] a middle path&quot; (pp. xxiv–xxv), neither gynophobic, gynocentric, philogynist, nor misogynist.

At the same time his writings expressed his beliefs in traditional gender roles. For example, he stated that women should not be teachers:
&quot;For Adam was created first, then Eve, and Adam was not seduced but the woman was seduced and led astray. Therefore, since woman is a weak creature and of uncertain judgment and is easily deceived (as Eve, the first parent of mankind, demonstrated, whom the devil deluded with such a slight pretext), she should not teach, lest when she has convinced herself of some false opinion, she transmit it to her listeners in her role as a teacher and easily drag others into her error, since pupils willingly follow their teacher.&quot; Also, his &quot;De institutione feminae christianae&quot;, published in 1523, was commissioned by Catherine of Aragon, Spanish Queen consort of Henry VIII of England, for her daughter, Mary. The purpose of the book was to instruct Mary on the proper roles for her to embrace. Ironically, it forbade the very role of Queen regnant, which both Princess Mary and her younger half-sister Elizabeth would later undertake and fulfill:
&quot;An unmarried young woman should rarely appear in public . . . who can have respect for a man who he sees is ruled by a woman?&quot;&quot; The book also provides a longer list of attributes for a married Christian woman. She should, according to Vives, be loyal, dedicated, and obedient to her husband within reason; she should choose to dress modestly, covering her face in public; she should never allow any other adult man inside her household without her husband&#x27;s permission. While a wife&#x27;s obedience and marital fidelity determined her honor, a husband&#x27;s honor and respect in the eyes of society stemmed from his ability to be the head of his household without abusing his power, to not be abused, dominated, or controlled by his wife, and to ensure that she remained faithful to their wedding vows.

Vives&#x27;s text for husbands, &quot;De los deberes del marido&quot;, fills less than half the length of his advice book for married women and focuses substantially on selecting and governing a good Christian wife rather than detailing how a Christian husband should behave in his own right.

===Thoughts on the soul===
Vives expressed an interest in the soul. He believed that understanding how the soul functions is more valuable than understanding the soul itself. &quot;He was not concerned with what the soul is, but rather what the soul was like&quot;. Norena explains that Vives thought that the soul had certain characteristics. He believed that the best part of the soul is its ability to &quot;…understand, remember, reason, and judge.&quot; Vives touched on the mind in terms of his explanations of the soul—he claims that one cannot simply define what the soul is, but by piecing together parts of it, a better concept of how the soul works can be achieved. He compared the soul to art with an analogy by stating: &quot;How we perceive a painted picture is more telling than declaring what the picture is itself&quot;. Vives rejected the deterministic view of human behavior, and said instead that the human mind and soul can &quot;modify our behavior in ethically and socially.&quot; He also suggested that the way we feel day to day affects whether our soul is attaining good or evil.

===Insight on medicine===
Vives is acknowledged for integrating psychology and medicine. &quot;His ideas were new and they paved the way for other contributions that have greatly impacted our society today in terms of how we view the impact of medicine on humans&quot;. He expressed the importance of animal testing before doing so on to people -–&quot;Although Vives did not perform actual medical procedures, his suggestions were among the first of his time.&quot; Vives had hopes that his ideas would influence the public. &quot;With time, some may argue that a sort of social reform was created largely due to Vives&#x27; ideas on medicine&quot;. Clements described Vives&#x27; contributions as being &quot;original,&quot; yet many would classify him as being very underrated in terms of his accomplishments and ideas. Vives also made important early observations on the health of the human body-—he urged that &quot;Personal habits of cleanliness and temperance greatly impacted health&quot;. He claimed that the cleanliness of the body impacts the welfare of the body and the mind. He touched on how to medicate the mentally unstable by saying that mocking, exciting, and irritating those individuals who are mentally ill does not contribute to their treatment. Vives said that &quot;Using the mentally ill as a form of entertainment is one of the most inhumane practices he had ever encountered&quot;. His belief was that some individuals who are mentally ill should be provided medication, but others just need friendly treatment.

===Emotions and the body===
Another psychological contribution from Vives involves his thoughts on emotion. His ideas were largely influenced by the ideologies that came from Galen and Hippocrates in terms of how emotion is related to bile in the body. He agreed with the two with the belief that &quot;different colored biles that humans have reflected different types of emotions&quot;. Further, Vives believed that &quot;Certain emotions color bile inside of human bodies and colored bodies likewise influences emotions&quot;. According to Norena, Vives followed Galen&#x27;s recommendations of eating certain types of food for certain types of temperaments. Vives also suggested that almost all of our emotions, even those considered to be negative, are actually beneficial in a lot of ways. He expressed how there is potential to learn and grow from negative emotions as well as positive emotions. His emphasis on animism, or animal spirits, influenced Descartes according to Clements. Vives suggested in his work that the degree in which how strongly a person believes in his or her morals have a great impact on the way they feel about themselves-—&quot;mental strength can influence physical strength&quot;. Emotions, according to Vives, can be divided up into &quot;Hot, cold, moist, dry, and varying combinations of the four&quot;. Personality disturbances with emotions could be fixed when applying the correct temperature on to the body.

===Memory===
Vives placed emphasis on memory. He defined memory as &quot;…relating to the past, while perception relates to the present&quot;. &quot;Memory is something that is retained by either externally or internally perceiving it&quot;. He especially emphasized how humans imagine something internally and connect it with an event in order to create a memory. This, according to Vives, makes information retrieval of memory easier. He touched on memories in which we are unaware of, otherwise known as the unconscious. He said information is the &quot;Most accessible from memory when a certain amount of attention is given.&quot; According to Murray, Vives showed understanding of the modern-day conception of how humans process retrieval. Vives observed that the more a memory is connected to a strong emotional experience, the easier it can be remembered. In terms of retaining memory, imagination was thought to play a key role, especially in children. He also believed in a theory that pointed towards the fact that memory can be improved with practice. He advised that &quot;One should memorize something every day, even a useless quotation.&quot; Vives even touched on childhood memory-—he believed that children learn quickly because their mind is less cluttered with worries that adult minds have. Vives also believed that recall of memory is brought about by a concept in which the soul processes the memory. Vives himself had a recall experience as a child where he ate cherries when he had a fever. When he had cherries again as an adult, he &quot;felt as though he was sick just as he was when he was a child.&quot; He found this remarkable and determined that memory can exist unconsciously for a very long time. He also believed that &quot;memory declines every day that the mind is not exercised.&quot;

===Learning===
Vives used the word &quot;intelligence&quot; in a way that can be translated to the word &quot;supervisor&quot; as we know its meaning today: intelligence, according to Vives, involves functions directing attention from different kinds of stimulus. Intelligence is very much a cognitive structure according to Vives. When we learn, the memory of the experience is locked in an order of the actual intelligence. Vives&#x27; perception on intelligence is that it is only important when it is put to use. Having an intelligent gift is only meaningful when the person is actively exercising it. The exercising of intelligence is important in retaining memory, which creates a better learning experience in general. Vives was among the first to suggest that the health of a student, the personality of the teacher, the classroom environment and the types of authors that the students are required to read from are all very important in how the student learns. &quot;Vives placed special stress upon the proper environment of the school as the first ecological ingredient of the child&#x27;s sense experience.&quot; He compared learning and gaining knowledge to how humans digest food. Feeding the mind with knowledge is the same as feeding the body with food; it is essential to the human being.

<doc id="314919" wikidata="Q872088" url="?curid=314919" title="Boolean prime ideal theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Boolean prime ideal theorem states that ideals in a Boolean algebra can be extended to prime ideals. A variation of this statement for filters on sets is known as the ultrafilter lemma. Other theorems are obtained by considering different mathematical structures with appropriate notions of ideals, for example, rings and prime ideals (of ring theory), or distributive lattices and &quot;maximal&quot; ideals (of order theory). This article focuses on prime ideal theorems from order theory.

Although the various prime ideal theorems may appear simple and intuitive, they cannot be deduced in general from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (abbreviated ZF). Instead, some of the statements turn out to be equivalent to the axiom of choice (AC), while others—the Boolean prime ideal theorem, for instance—represent a property that is strictly weaker than AC. It is due to this intermediate status between ZF and ZF + AC (ZFC) that the Boolean prime ideal theorem is often taken as an axiom of set theory. The abbreviations BPI or PIT (for Boolean algebras) are sometimes used to refer to this additional axiom.

==Prime ideal theorems==
An order ideal is a (non-empty) directed lower set. If the considered partially ordered set (poset) has binary suprema (a.k.a. joins), as do the posets within this article, then this is equivalently characterized as a non-empty lower set &quot;I&quot; that is closed for binary suprema (that is, formula_1 implies formula_2). An ideal &quot;I&quot; is prime if its set-theoretic complement in the poset is a filter (that is, formula_3 implies formula_4 or formula_5). Ideals are proper if they are not equal to the whole poset.

Historically, the first statement relating to later prime ideal theorems was in fact referring to filters—subsets that are ideals with respect to the dual order. The ultrafilter lemma states that every filter on a set is contained within some maximal (proper) filter—an &quot;ultrafilter&quot;. Recall that filters on sets are proper filters of the Boolean algebra of its powerset. In this special case, maximal filters (i.e. filters that are not strict subsets of any proper filter) and prime filters (i.e. filters that with each union of subsets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; contain also &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot;) coincide. The dual of this statement thus assures that every ideal of a powerset is contained in a prime ideal.

The above statement led to various generalized prime ideal theorems, each of which exists in a weak and in a strong form. &quot;Weak prime ideal theorems&quot; state that every &quot;non-trivial&quot; algebra of a certain class has at least one prime ideal. In contrast, &quot;strong prime ideal theorems&quot; require that every ideal that is disjoint from a given filter can be extended to a prime ideal that is still disjoint from that filter. In the case of algebras that are not posets, one uses different substructures instead of filters. Many forms of these theorems are actually known to be equivalent, so that the assertion that &quot;PIT&quot; holds is usually taken as the assertion that the corresponding statement for Boolean algebras (BPI) is valid.

Another variation of similar theorems is obtained by replacing each occurrence of &quot;prime ideal&quot; by &quot;maximal ideal&quot;. The corresponding maximal ideal theorems (MIT) are often—though not always—stronger than their PIT equivalents.

==Boolean prime ideal theorem==
The Boolean prime ideal theorem is the strong prime ideal theorem for Boolean algebras. Thus the formal statement is:

: Let &quot;B&quot; be a Boolean algebra, let &quot;I&quot; be an ideal and let &quot;F&quot; be a filter of &quot;B&quot;, such that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are disjoint. Then &quot;I&quot; is contained in some prime ideal of &quot;B&quot; that is disjoint from &quot;F&quot;.

The weak prime ideal theorem for Boolean algebras simply states:

: Every Boolean algebra contains a prime ideal.

We refer to these statements as the weak and strong &quot;BPI&quot;. The two are equivalent, as the strong BPI clearly implies the weak BPI, and the reverse implication can be achieved by using the weak BPI to find prime ideals in the appropriate quotient algebra.

The BPI can be expressed in various ways. For this purpose, recall the following theorem:

For any ideal &quot;I&quot; of a Boolean algebra &quot;B&quot;, the following are equivalent:
* &quot;I&quot; is a prime ideal.
* &quot;I&quot; is a maximal ideal, i.e. for any proper ideal &quot;J&quot;, if &quot;I&quot; is contained in &quot;J&quot; then &quot;I&quot; = &quot;J&quot;.
* For every element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;B&quot;, &quot;I&quot; contains exactly one of {&quot;a&quot;, ¬&quot;a&quot;}.
This theorem is a well-known fact for Boolean algebras. Its dual establishes the equivalence of prime filters and ultrafilters. Note that the last property is in fact self-dual—only the prior assumption that &quot;I&quot; is an ideal gives the full characterization. All of the implications within this theorem can be proven in ZF.

Thus the following (strong) maximal ideal theorem (MIT) for Boolean algebras is equivalent to BPI:

:Let &quot;B&quot; be a Boolean algebra, let &quot;I&quot; be an ideal and let &quot;F&quot; be a filter of &quot;B&quot;, such that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are disjoint. Then &quot;I&quot; is contained in some maximal ideal of &quot;B&quot; that is disjoint from &quot;F&quot;.

Note that one requires &quot;global&quot; maximality, not just maximality with respect to being disjoint from &quot;F&quot;. Yet, this variation yields another equivalent characterization of BPI:

:Let &quot;B&quot; be a Boolean algebra, let &quot;I&quot; be an ideal and let &quot;F&quot; be a filter of &quot;B&quot;, such that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are disjoint. Then &quot;I&quot; is contained in some ideal of &quot;B&quot; that is maximal among all ideals disjoint from &quot;F&quot;.

The fact that this statement is equivalent to BPI is easily established by noting the following theorem: For any distributive lattice &quot;L&quot;, if an ideal &quot;I&quot; is maximal among all ideals of &quot;L&quot; that are disjoint to a given filter &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;I&quot; is a prime ideal. The proof for this statement (which can again be carried out in ZF set theory) is included in the article on ideals. Since any Boolean algebra is a distributive lattice, this shows the desired implication.

All of the above statements are now easily seen to be equivalent. Going even further, one can exploit the fact the dual orders of Boolean algebras are exactly the Boolean algebras themselves. Hence, when taking the equivalent duals of all former statements, one ends up with a number of theorems that equally apply to Boolean algebras, but where every occurrence of is replaced by . It is worth noting that for the special case where the Boolean algebra under consideration is a powerset with the subset ordering, the &quot;maximal filter theorem&quot; is called the ultrafilter lemma.

Summing up, for Boolean algebras, the weak and strong MIT, the weak and strong PIT, and these statements with filters in place of ideals are all equivalent. It is known that all of these statements are consequences of the Axiom of Choice, &quot;AC&quot;, (the easy proof makes use of Zorn&#x27;s lemma), but cannot be proven in ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without &quot;AC&quot;), if ZF is consistent. Yet, the BPI is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice, though the proof of this statement, due to J. D. Halpern and Azriel Lévy is rather non-trivial.

==Further prime ideal theorems==
The prototypical properties that were discussed for Boolean algebras in the above section can easily be modified to include more general lattices, such as distributive lattices or Heyting algebras. However, in these cases maximal ideals are different from prime ideals, and the relation between PITs and MITs is not obvious.

Indeed, it turns out that the MITs for distributive lattices and even for Heyting algebras are equivalent to the axiom of choice. On the other hand, it is known that the strong PIT for distributive lattices is equivalent to BPI (i.e. to the MIT and PIT for Boolean algebras). Hence this statement is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice. Furthermore, observe that Heyting algebras are not self dual, and thus using filters in place of ideals yields different theorems in this setting. Maybe surprisingly, the MIT for the duals of Heyting algebras is not stronger than BPI, which is in sharp contrast to the abovementioned MIT for Heyting algebras.

Finally, prime ideal theorems do also exist for other (not order-theoretical) abstract algebras. For example, the MIT for rings implies the axiom of choice. This situation requires to replace the order-theoretic term &quot;filter&quot; by other concepts—for rings a &quot;multiplicatively closed subset&quot; is appropriate.

==The ultrafilter lemma==

A filter on a set is a nonempty collection of nonempty subsets of that is closed under finite intersection and under superset. An ultrafilter is a maximal filter.
The ultrafilter lemma states that every filter on a set is a subset of some ultrafilter on .
An ultrafilter that does not contain finite sets is called &quot;non-principal&quot;. The ultrafilter lemma, and in particular the existence of non-principal ultrafilters (consider the filter of all sets with finite complements), can be proven from Zorn&#x27;s lemma.

The ultrafilter lemma is equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, with the equivalence provable in ZF set theory without the axiom of choice. The idea behind the proof is that the subsets of any set form a Boolean algebra partially ordered by inclusion, and any Boolean algebra is representable as an algebra of sets by Stone&#x27;s representation theorem.

If the set is finite then the ultrafilter lemma can be proven from the axioms ZF. This is no longer true for infinite sets; an additional axiom be assumed. Zorn&#x27;s lemma, the axiom of choice, and Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem can all be used to prove the ultrafilter lemma. The ultrafilter lemma is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice.

The ultrafilter lemma has many applications in topology. The ultrafilter lemma can be used to prove the Hahn-Banach theorem and the Alexander subbase theorem.

==Applications==
Intuitively, the Boolean prime ideal theorem states that there are &quot;enough&quot; prime ideals in a Boolean algebra in the sense that we can extend &quot;every&quot; ideal to a maximal one. This is of practical importance for proving Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras, a special case of Stone duality, in which one equips the set of all prime ideals with a certain topology and can indeed regain the original Boolean algebra (up to isomorphism) from this data. Furthermore, it turns out that in applications one can freely choose either to work with prime ideals or with prime filters, because every ideal uniquely determines a filter: the set of all Boolean complements of its elements. Both approaches are found in the literature.

Many other theorems of general topology that are often said to rely on the axiom of choice are in fact equivalent to BPI. For example, the theorem that a product of compact Hausdorff spaces is compact is equivalent to it. If we leave out &quot;Hausdorff&quot; we get a theorem equivalent to the full axiom of choice.

In graph theory, the de Bruijn–Erdős theorem is another equivalent to BPI. It states that, if a given infinite graph requires at least some finite number in any graph coloring, then it has a finite subgraph that also requires .

A not too well known application of the Boolean prime ideal theorem is the existence of a non-measurable set (the example usually given is the Vitali set, which requires the axiom of choice). From this and the fact that the BPI is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice, it follows that the existence of non-measurable sets is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice.

In linear algebra, the Boolean prime ideal theorem can be used to prove that any two bases of a given vector space have the same cardinality.

<text>Cuthbert Tunstall (otherwise spelt Tunstal or Tonstall; 1474 – 18 November 1559) was an English humanist, bishop, diplomat, administrator and royal adviser. He served as Bishop of Durham during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I.

==Childhood and early career==
Cuthbert Tunstall was born in Hackforth near Bedale in North Yorkshire in 1474, illegitimate son of Sir Thomas Tunstall of Thurland Castle in Lancashire, who was later an esquire of the body of Richard III. His half-brother, Sir Brian Tunstall, the so-called &quot;stainless knight,&quot; was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Sir Walter Scott mentions &quot;stainless Tunstall&#x27;s banner white&quot; in Canto Six, line 790 of &quot;Marmion&quot;.

Little is known of Tunstall&#x27;s early life, except that he spent two years as a kitchen boy in the household of Sir Thomas Holland, perhaps at Lynn, Norfolk. He was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford around 1491, where he studied mathematics, theology, and law. Around 1496, he became a scholar of the King&#x27;s Hall, Cambridge. He did not receive a degree from either Oxford or Cambridge; he graduated from the University of Padua in 1505 as a Doctor of Civil Law and a Doctor of Canon Law. At Padua, he studied under some of the leading humanists and became proficient in Greek and Hebrew.

William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, made Tunstall his chancellor on 25 August 1511, and shortly afterward he appointed him rector of Harrow on the Hill. He became a canon of Lincoln in 1514, and archdeacon of Chester in 1515. Soon thereafter, he was employed on diplomatic business by King Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey. In 1515, Tunstall was sent to Flanders with Sir Thomas More, a friend since his school days, which More mentions in a glowing tribute in the opening paragraph of Utopia. At Brussels, he met Erasmus as well, becoming the intimate friend of both scholars and Peter Gilles, becoming the godfather to Gilles&#x27; daughter. He helped Erasmus make corrections to the second edition of his New Testament. In 1519, he was sent to Cologne; a visit to Worms (1520–21) gave him a sense of the threatening significance held by the Lutheran movement.

Tunstall was made Master of the Rolls in 1516 and Dean of Salisbury in 1521. In 1522, he published the first book of mathematics printed in England, based on the Italian Luca Pacioli. In 1522, he became Bishop of London by papal provision, and on 25 May 1523, he was made Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. In 1525, he negotiated with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V after the Battle of Pavia, and he helped to arrange the Peace of Cambrai in 1529.

==Protestantism==
Tunstall met William Tyndale in 1523 seeking patronage to translate the Bible (into contemporaneous Early Modern English,) which Tunstall declined, saying he already funded several scholars. Tunstall, who preferred burning heretical books to heretics, later presided over the buying up and burning of almost all copies of the first edition of Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament at Paul&#x27;s Cross in October 1526. According to some scholars this helped fund Tyndale&#x27;s subsequent improved edition, as Thomas More had warned.

==Bishop of Durham under Henry VIII and Edward VI==

On 22 February 1530, again by papal provision, Tunstall succeeded Cardinal Wolsey as Bishop of Durham. This role involved the assumption of quasi-regal power and authority within the territory of the diocese, the County Palatine of Durham. In 1537, he was made President of the new Council of the North. Although he was often engaged in time-consuming negotiations with the Scots, he took part in other public business and attended parliament where, in 1539, he participated in the discussion on the Bill of Six Articles.

In the question of King Henry&#x27;s divorce, Tunstall acted as one of Queen Catherine&#x27;s counselors. Unlike Bishop John Fisher and Sir Thomas More, Tunstall adopted a policy of passive obedience and acquiescence regarding many matters for which he likely held little support during the troubled years following the English Reformation. While Tunstall adhered firmly to Roman Catholic doctrine and practices, after some hesitation he accepted Henry as head of the Church of England, and he publicly defended this position, accepting a schism with Rome.

Tunstall disliked the religious policy pursued by the advisers of King Edward VI and voted against the first Act of Uniformity in 1549. However, he continued to discharge his public duties without interruption and hoped in vain that the Earl of Warwick might be convinced to reverse the anti-Catholic policy of the Duke of Somerset. After Somerset&#x27;s fall, Tunstall was summoned to London in May 1551 and confined to his house there. During this captivity, he composed a treatise on the Eucharist, which was published in Paris in 1554. At the end of 1551, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, and a bill for his deprivation was introduced into the House of Commons. When this failed, he was tried by a commission on 4–5 October 1552 and deprived of his bishopric.

==Bishop of Durham under Mary I and Elizabeth I==
On the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary I to the throne in 1553, Tunstall was granted liberty. His bishopric, which had been dissolved by Act of Parliament in March 1553, was re-established by a further Act in April 1554. Tunstall assumed his office as Bishop of Durham once more. He maintained his earlier conciliatory approach, indulging in no systematic persecution of Protestants. Through Mary&#x27;s reign he ruled his diocese in peace.

When the Protestant Elizabeth I ascended to the throne, Tunstall refused to take the Oath of Supremacy and would not participate in the consecration of the Anglican Matthew Parker as Archbishop of Canterbury. He was arrested, deprived again of his diocese in September 1559, and held prisoner at Lambeth Palace, where he died within a few weeks, aged 85. He was one of eleven Roman Catholic bishops to die in custody during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign.

He was buried in the parish church of St Mary-at-Lambeth, now a deconsecrated building.

<doc id="314924" wikidata="Q983339" url="?curid=314924" title="William Gillette">
<text>William Hooker Gillette (July 24, 1853 – April 29, 1937) was an American actor-manager, playwright, and stage manager in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is best remembered for portraying Sherlock Holmes on stage and in a 1916 silent film.

Gillette&#x27;s most significant contributions to the theater were in devising realistic stage settings and special sound and lighting effects, and as an actor in putting forth what he called the &quot;Illusion of the First Time.&quot; His portrayal of Holmes helped create the modern image of the detective. His use of the deerstalker cap (which first appeared in some &quot;Strand&quot; illustrations by Sidney Paget) and the curved pipe became enduring symbols of the character. He assumed the role on stage more than 1,300 times over thirty years, starred in the silent motion picture based on his Holmes play, and voiced the character twice on radio.

His first Civil War drama &quot;Held by the Enemy&quot; (1886) was a major step toward modern theater, in that it abandoned many of the crude devices of 19th-century melodrama and introduced realism into the sets, costumes, props, and sound effects. It was produced at a time when the British had a very low opinion of American art in any form, and it was the first wholly American play with a wholly American theme to be a critical and commercial success on British stages. In November 1915 he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Early life==
Gillette was born in Nook Farm, Hartford, Connecticut, a literary and intellectual center with residents such as Mark Twain, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Charles Dudley Warner.

Gillette&#x27;s father, Francis, had been a United States Senator and a crusader for public education, temperance, the abolition of slavery, and women&#x27;s suffrage. His mother, Elisabeth Daggett Hooker, was a descendant of the Reverend Thomas Hooker, the English-born Puritan leader who founded the town of Hartford and either wrote or inspired the first written constitution in history to form a government. Gillette had three brothers and a sister. Another sister named Mary died as a small child.

His eldest brother, Frank Ashbell Gillette, went to California and died there in 1859 from consumption (tuberculosis). The third oldest brother, Robert, joined the Union Army and served in the Antietam campaign, was invalided home sick, recovered, and joined the Navy. Robert Gillette was assigned to the U.S.S. &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and took part in both assaults on Fort Fisher. He was killed the morning after the surrender of the fort when the powder magazine exploded. His brother Edward moved to Iowa and his sister Elizabeth married George Henry Warner, both in 1863, after which William was the only child in the household.

At the age of 20, he left Hartford to begin his apprenticeship as an actor. He briefly worked for a stock company in New Orleans and then returned to New England where, on Mark Twain&#x27;s own recommendation, he debuted at the Globe Theater of Boston with Twain&#x27;s stage-play &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; in 1875. Afterward, he was a stock actor for six years through Boston, New York, and the Midwest. He irregularly attended classes at a few institutions, although he never completed their programs. His father Francis had held the strongest objections to the theater in general, but he offered the least resistance and drove him to the train station, telling his son that he had driven two other sons to this same station and they had never returned; William was to make sure that he was the exception. Francis supplied him with an allowance on which to subsist (his apprenticeship was without pay).

His father&#x27;s health began to fail in 1878, and William forsook the stage for more than a year to care for him in his final illness. Upon his father&#x27;s death, he and George Henry Warner were named executors of Francis&#x27; estate, and they, Elisabeth, and Edward shared in the inheritance.

==Theatrical career==
===Playwright, director, and actor===

Gillette was hired as playwright, director, and actor for $50 per week in 1881, while performing at Cincinnati, by two of the Frohman brothers, Gustave and Daniel. The first play that he wrote and produced was &quot;The Professor&quot;. It debuted in the Madison Square Theatre, lasting 151 performances, with a subsequent tour through many states (as far west as St. Louis, Missouri). That same year, he produced &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, written together with Frances Hodgson Burnett.

Early in his career, Gillette realized that it would be in the triple role of playwright, director, and actor that he could make the most money. He was among the premier matinee idols of his day, and was described by actress/drama critic Amy Leslie as &quot;one of Gibson&#x27;s notables materialized&quot;. Lewis Clinton Strang observed that &quot;he rarely gesticulates, and his bodily movements often seem purposely slow and deliberate. His composure is absolute and his mental grasp of a situation is complete.&quot;

&quot;Occasionally&quot;, Georg Schuttler pointed out, &quot;when it was least expected, he gestured or moved his body so quickly that the speed of the action was compared to the swift opening and closing of a camera&#x27;s shutter.&quot;
S. E. Dahlinger, leading expert on the play &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, summed him up: &quot;Without seeming to raise his voice or ever to force an emotion, he could be thrilling without bombast or infinitely touching without descending to sentimentality. One of his greatest strengths as an actor was the ability to say nothing at all on the stage, relying instead on an involved, inner contemplation of an emotional or comic crisis to hold the audience silent, waiting for the moment when he would speak again.&quot;

He was an unemotional actor, unable to emote, even in love scenes, about which Montrose Moses commented, &quot;he made appeal through the sentiment of situation, through the exquisite sensitiveness of outward detail, rather than through romantic attitude and heart fervor.&quot;

Ward Morehouse described Gillette&#x27;s style as &quot;dry, crisp, metallic, almost shrill.&quot; Gretchen Finletter recalled that it was &quot;a dry, almost monotonous voice admirably suited to the great Holmes&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted in 1937 that &quot;it would be hard to convince that portion of the American public that knew and followed him that any better actor had ever trod the American stage ... It would be conservative to say that Mr. Gillette was the most successful of all American actors.&quot;

He had a heightened sense of the dramatic, and his two most riveting scenes are still considered to be among the most dramatic scenes in the history of the American theater: the hospital scene in &quot;Held by the Enemy&quot; and the Telegraph Office scene in &quot;Secret Service&quot;.

Gillette treated both sides of the American Civil War equally, bestowing integrity, loyalty, and honor on both North and South, even as he made a spy each play&#x27;s sympathetic hero. Yet, what set Gillette apart from all the rest was not simply his reliance on realism, his imperturbable naturalistic acting, or his superior sense of the dramatic. He &quot;was also a pioneer in making American drama &#x27;American&#x27;, rejecting what had been up until that time a pervasive European influence on American theater&quot; at a time when American art of all kinds was held in very low esteem by the British.

===Inventor===

During an 1886–87 production of &quot;Held by the Enemy&quot;, Gillette introduced a new method of simulating the galloping of a horse. Men formerly had slammed halves of coconut shells on a slab of marble to simulate the sound, but Gillette found this clumsy and unrealistic. Patent No. 389,294 was applied for on June 9 and issued to him on September 11, entitled &quot;Method of Producing Stage Effects&quot;. It was a method, not a mechanical device, so there were no illustrations in the two-page document. And the patent was very broad, introducing &quot;a new and useful method of imitating the sound of a horse or horses approaching, departing, or passing at a gallop, trot, or any other desired gait, the same to be used in producing stage effects in theatrical or other performances or entertainments, exhibitions, &amp;c.&quot;

His method consisted in &quot;beating with clappers, that represent the hoofs of a horse, upon some material that serves to represent the road-bed over which the horse is supposed to be traveling&quot; as well as &quot;stamping, pawing, or jumping about in a restive manner while the rider is mounting, and then starting off, first at a trot, then a gallop, and finally a run, or at any gait desired, in any order&quot;. He could also imitate the sounds of the hoofs pounding on different surfaces: &quot;stone, brick, clay, gravel, greensward, or when crossing bridges.&quot;

It was not the first patent which he had applied for and received. In 1883, he filed the first of four patent requests with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a Time-Stamp &quot;as stamps upon the upper surface of papers a dial and one or more dial-pointers, representing the time of day at which the papers stamped by it were respectively so stamped.&quot; All four requests were granted.

===Stage comeback===
Charles Frohman was a young Broadway producer who had been successful exchanging theater productions between the U.S. and the UK. After he produced some of Gillette&#x27;s plays, the two formed a greater partnership. Their productions had great success, sweeping Gillette into London&#x27;s society spot, which had been historically reluctant to accept American theatre. With &quot;Held by the Enemy&quot; in 1887, Gillette became the first American playwright to achieve true success on British stages with an authentic American play.

Gillette finally came fully out of retirement in October 1894 in &quot;Too Much Johnson&quot;, adapted from the French farce &quot;La Plantation Thomassin&quot; by Maurice Ordonneau. Its debut was at the Park Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts, then it opened on October 29 at the Columbia Theatre in Brooklyn. This farce was extremely popular, and has been produced on stage several times in the century since its debut.

In 1895, he wrote &quot;Secret Service&quot;, which was first performed in the Broad Street Theatre in Philadelphia for two weeks beginning on May 13, 1895, with Maurice Barrymore in the lead role. Gillette rewrote some of the script and starred in the play when it opened at the Garrick Theatre on October 5, 1896. It was the first time that he had taken on the role of the romantic hero in one of his own plays. The production ran until March 6, 1897, and was an enormous critical and popular success.

Following its American success, Frohman booked &quot;Secret Service&quot; to open at the Adelphi Theatre on the West End in London on May 15, 1897, and it became the cornerstone of Frohman&#x27;s achievements in England. It became Gillette&#x27;s best known work outside of the Holmes adaptations, being adapted through the decades for silent and sound film, and television, as well as Broadway revivals. The well-known gun-switching scene is referenced in the 1920s hard-boiled detective story &quot;Devil Cat&quot;, by Carroll John Daly.

==Sherlock Holmes==

Meanwhile, Arthur Conan Doyle felt that the character of Sherlock Holmes was stifling him and keeping him from more worthy literary work. He had finished his Holmes saga and killed him off in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; published in 1893. Afterwards, however, Conan Doyle found himself in need of further income, as he was planning to build a new home called &quot;Undershaw&quot;. He decided to take his character to the stage and wrote a play. Holmes had appeared in two earlier stage works by other authors in Charles Brookfield&#x27;s skit &quot;Under the Clock&quot; (1893) and John Webb&#x27;s play &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1894); nevertheless, Doyle now wrote a new five-act play with Holmes and Watson in their freshmen years as detectives.

Doyle offered the role first to Herbert Beerbohm Tree and then to Henry Irving. Irving turned it down and Tree demanded that Doyle readapt Holmes to his peculiar acting profile; he also wanted to play both Holmes and Professor Moriarty. Doyle turned down the deal, considering that this would debase the character.

Literary agent A. P. Watt noted that the play needed a lot of work and sent the script to Charles Frohman, who traveled to London to meet Conan Doyle. There Frohman suggested the prospect of an adaptation by Gillette. Doyle endorsed this and Frohman obtained the &quot;staging-copyright&quot;. Doyle insisted on only one thing: there was to be no love interest in &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Frohman uttered a Victorian rendition of &quot;Trust me!&quot;

Gillette then read the entire collection for the first time, outlining the piece in San Francisco while still touring in &quot;Secret Service&quot;. On one occasion, after they had exchanged numerous telegrams about the play, Gillette telegraphed Conan Doyle: &quot;May I marry Holmes?&quot; Doyle responded: &quot;You may marry him, or murder or do what you like with him.&quot;

===Milestones===
====New Holmes play====
Gillette&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; consisted of four acts combining elements from several of Doyle&#x27;s stories. He mainly utilized the plots &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. Also, it had elements from &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;, and &quot;The Greek Interpreter&quot;. However, all the characters in the play were Gillette&#x27;s own creations with the exception of Holmes, Watson, and Moriarty. His creation of Billy the Buttons (Pageboy) was later used by Doyle for &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot;. Gillette portrayed Holmes as brave and open to express his feelings, which was substantially different from the intellectual-only original, &quot;a machine rather than a man&quot;.

He wore the deerstalker cap on stage, which was originally featured in illustrations by Sidney Paget.

====Props and famous phrase====
Gillette introduced the curved or bent briar pipe instead of the straight pipe pictured by &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; illustrator Sidney Paget, most likely so that Gillette could pronounce his lines more easily; a straight pipe can wiggle or fall when speaking, or cause problems with declaring lines while it is clenched between the teeth. It is less difficult to pronounce lines clearly with a curved pipe. Some have lately theorized that a straight pipe may have obscured Gillette&#x27;s face. This could not happen with a curved briar in his mouth. He made use of a magnifying-glass, a violin, and a syringe, which all came from the Canon and which were all now established as &quot;props&quot; to the Sherlock Holmes character. Gillette formulated the complete phrase: &quot;Oh, this is elementary, my dear fellow&quot;, which was later reused by Clive Brook, the first spoken-cinema Holmes, as: &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot;, Holmes&#x27;s best known line and one of the most famous expressions in the English language.

====Characters====
Irene Adler was &quot;The Woman&quot; of the Holmes canon, but she was replaced by Alice Faulkner, a young and beautiful lady who was planning to avenge her sister&#x27;s murder but eventually fell in love with Holmes; and the pageboy, nameless in the Canon, was given the name Billy by Gillette, a name that carried over into the Basil Rathbone films and that has been retained ever since. &quot;Sherlock Holmes, or The Strange Case of Miss Faulkner&quot; (later renamed &quot;Sherlock Holmes – A Drama in Four Acts&quot;) was finished.

===Baldwin Hotel theater fire===
The &quot;Secret Service&quot; company was playing in San Francisco and staying in the Baldwin Hotel when a fire swept from the property room of the Baldwin Theatre through the hotel in the early morning hours of November 23. The play&#x27;s script was in the possession of Gillette&#x27;s secretary William Postance, in his room at the Baldwin Hotel. The financial loss was estimated at nearly $1,500,000. Only two deaths were known at first, though several people were missing. The flames were confined to the Baldwin, though smoke and water damaged the adjoining structures.

Gillette&#x27;s secretary barely escaped, but the entire script was reduced to ashes. Postance went to the Palace Hotel where Gillette was sound asleep, and awakened him at 3:30 in the morning to break the bad news. Gillette was not overly happy about being disturbed in the middle of the night and simply asked, &quot;Is this hotel on fire?&quot; Assured that it was not, he told Postance, &quot;Well, come and tell me about it in the morning.&quot; Both manuscripts were destroyed – Conan Doyle&#x27;s original and Gillette&#x27;s adaptation – but Gillette rewrote the piece in a month, either from notes or an extra copy. Conan Doyle and Gillette had never met, so Conan Doyle&#x27;s shock was understandable, once the two finally arranged a meeting, when the train carrying Gillette came to a halt and Sherlock Holmes himself stepped onto the platform instead of the actor, complete with deerstalker cap and gray ulster. Sitting in his landau, Conan Doyle contemplated the apparition with open-mouthed awe until the actor whipped out a magnifying lens, examined Doyle&#x27;s face closely, and declared (precisely as Holmes himself might have done), &quot;Unquestionably an author!&quot; Conan Doyle broke into a hearty laugh and the partnership was sealed with the mirth and hospitality of a weekend at Undershaw. The two men became lifelong friends.

===Holmes tour===

After a copyright performance in England, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; debuted on October 23, 1899, at the Star Theatre in Buffalo, followed by appearances in Rochester and Syracuse, New York and in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; made its Broadway debut at the Garrick Theater on November 6, 1899, performing until June 16, 1900. It was an instant success. Gillette applied all his dazzling special effects over the massive audience.

The company also toured nationally along the western United States from October 8, 1900, until March 30, 1901. This was bolstered by another company with Cuyler Hastings touring through minor cities and Australia. After a pre-debut week in Liverpool, the company debuted in London (September 9, 1901) at the &quot;Lyceum Theatre&quot;, performing in the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre later.

It was another hit with its audience, despite not convincing the critics. The 12 weeks originally appointed were at full-hall. The production was extended until April 12, 1902 (256 presentations), including a gala for King Edward VII on February 1. Then it toured England and Scotland with two ancillary groups: North (with H. A. Saintsbury) and South (with Julian Royce). At the same time, the play was produced in foreign countries (such as Australia, Sweden, and South Africa).

Sir Henry Irving was touring America when &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; opened at the Garrick Theatre, and Irving saw Gillette as Holmes. The two actors met and Irving concluded negotiations for &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; to begin an extended season at the Lyceum Theatre in London beginning in early May. Gillette was the first American actor ever to be invited to perform on that illustrious stage, which was an enormous honor. Irving was the dean of British actors, the first ever to be knighted, and the Lyceum was his theater.

&quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; made its British debut at the Shakespeare Theatre on Fraser Street, Liverpool, on September 2, 1901. It was the beginning of a major triumph. Gillette then opened &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; at the Lyceum in London on September 9. The Lyceum tour alone netted Gillette nearly $100,000, and it made the most money of all the productions in the final years of Irving&#x27;s tenure at the Lyceum.

In the United States, Gillette again toured from 1902 until November 1903, starring in &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; by James M. Barrie. Gillette&#x27;s own play &quot;Electricity&quot; appeared in 1910, and he starred in Victorien Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Diplomacy&quot; in 1914, Clare Kummer&#x27;s &quot;A Successful Calamity&quot; in 1917, Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; in 1918, and Gillette&#x27;s &quot;The Dream Maker&quot; in 1921. A brief revival of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; in early 1923 did not generate enough interest to return to Broadway, so he retired to his Hadlyme estate.

===Worldwide fame===
In his lifetime, Gillette presented &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; approximately 1,300 times (third in the historical stage-record), before American and English audiences. He was also shown widely, through appearances in many editions of the Sherlock Holmes canon and in magazines by way of photographs or illustrations, and was also well represented on the covers of theater programs.

Around the world, other productions took place, based on Gillette&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. These were often satirical or parodical, which were sometimes successful enough to last several seasons. Frohman&#x27;s lawyers tried to curb the illegal phenomenon exhaustedly, traveling overseas, from court to court. Legitimate productions were also produced throughout Europe and Australia for many years.

Even Gillette parodied it once. &quot;The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes&quot; – the first of a handful of one-act plays he would write – was written for two benefits, and was performed for the first time at the Joseph Jefferson Holland Benefit at the Metropolitan Opera House on March 24. Holland was an actor who had been forced to retire the year before due to illness. The skit featured five characters: Holmes, Billy the page boy (played by Henry McArdle), the madwoman Gwendolyn Cobb (who had nearly all of the dialogue and was played by Ethel Barrymore), and the two &quot;valuable assistants&quot; who come to take the madwoman away. Its original title was &quot;A fantasy in about one-tenth of an act&quot;, and the entire scene transpires in Holmes&#x27; Baker Street room &quot;somewhere about the date of day before yesterday.&quot; Retitled &quot;The Harrowing Predicament of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, it was performed again on April 14 for the benefit of the Actors Society of America at the Criterion Theatre (with Jessie Busley as Gwendolyn Cobb and McArdle again as Billy), and again at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London when Gillette inserted it on October 3 as a curtain-raiser for &quot;Clarice&quot;. Playing Billy in the curtain-raiser was young Charlie Chaplin. When &quot;Clarice&quot; was replaced with &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Chaplin continued as Billy.

===Models for Holmes&#x27; portrait===
The magazines &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (USA) and &quot;The Strand&quot; (UK) pushed Conan Doyle avidly, offering to continue the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series for a generous salary. The new stories were resumed in 1901, first with a prequel (&quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;) and then with Holmes actually revived in 1903 (in &quot;The Empty House&quot;). The Holmes series continued for another quarter-century, culminating with the bound edition of &quot;The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1927.

Gillette was the model for pictures by the artist Frederic Dorr Steele, which were featured in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; then and reproduced by American media. Steele contributed to Conan Doyle&#x27;s book-covers, later doing marketing when Gillette made his farewell performances. Conan Doyle&#x27;s series were widely printed throughout the US, with either Steele&#x27;s illustrations or photographs of Gillette on stage.

In 1907 Gillette was caricatured in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by Sir Leslie Ward (who signed his work &quot;Spy&quot;) (see above), and later became the subject of such famous American caricaturists as Pamela Colman Smith, Ralph Barton and Al Freuh.

==Gillette Castle==
While most of Gillette&#x27;s work has long been forgotten, his last great masterpiece is still well known today: Gillette Castle in Hadlyme, Connecticut. The castle sits atop a hill, part of the Seven Sisters chain, over the Chester–Hadlyme ferry&#x27;s pier. The design of the castle and its grounds features numerous innovative features, and the entire castle was designed, to the smallest detail, by Gillette.

The material for the castle was carried up by a tramway designed by him. During the five years of construction from 1914 to 1919, he lived aboard his houseboat, the &quot;Aunt Polly&quot;, named after a woman who allegedly tended to him when he was sick, or at a home he had purchased in Greenport, Long Island. The mansion was finished in 1919, at a cost of US$1.1 million. Gillette called it &quot;Seventh Sister&quot;.

His miniature railroad was his personal pride. The train&#x27;s layout was long, and it traveled all around the property, crossing several bridges and going through one tunnel designed by Gillette. The train was relocated after his death to an amusement park, Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut, from 1943 through the mid-90s. Since then, both locomotives have been returned to the castle, where one has been restored and is on display in the Visitors Center.

Gillette had no children and, after he died, his will stated:
In 1943, the Connecticut state government bought the property, renaming it Gillette&#x27;s Castle and Gillette Castle State Park. Located at 67 River Road, East Haddam, Connecticut, it was reopened in 2002. After a four-year restoration costing $11 million, it now includes a museum, park, and many theatrical celebrations. It receives 100,000 annual visitors. The castle is No. 86002103 on the National Register of Historic Places. It remains one of the top three tourist attractions in the state.

In 1972, a Sherlock Holmes deerstalker cap and other memorabilia related to Gillette were donated to the State of Connecticut by Doreen Carlos-Perkins, daughter of Louise Rutter, an actress who worked with Gillette on Broadway.

==Personal life==
In 1882, Gillette married Helen Nichols of Detroit. She died in 1888 from peritonitis caused by a ruptured appendix. The couple had no children. He never remarried.
In 1897, Gilette met Japanese immigrant Yukitaka Osaki and hired him to work on his houseboat &quot;The Holy Terror&quot; and, a few years later, his newly commissioned boat, &quot;Aunt Polly&quot;. Osaki eventually became Gillette&#x27;s valet, assistant, stage dresser for his performances, and close companion for over four decades until Gillette&#x27;s death. Gillette was very fond of cats, at one time shared his home, Gillette Castle with up to 17 cats. For them, he designed finely crafted cat toys.

==Last years and farewell tour==

Gillette announced his retirement many times throughout his career, despite not actually accomplishing this until his death. The first announced retirement took place after the start of the 20th century, after he purchased the boat &quot;Aunt Polly&quot; which was in length and weighed 200 tons.

&quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; was Gillette&#x27;s foremost production with 1,300 performances (in 1899–1901, 1905, 1906, 1910, 1915, 1923, and 1929–1932). While performing on other tours, he was always forced by popular demand to include at least one extra performance of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. In 1929, at the age of 76, Gillette started the farewell tour of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, in Springfield, Massachusetts. Scheduled for two seasons, it was eventually extended into 1932. The first run of the tour included in the cast Theatre Guild actress Peg Entwistle as Gillette&#x27;s female lead. Entwistle was the tragic young actress who committed suicide by jumping from the Hollywoodland sign in 1932.

In the New Amsterdam Theatre of New York, on November 25, 1929, a great ceremony took place. Gillette received a Signature book, autographed by 60 different world eminences. In a letter to Gillette, Arthur Conan Doyle stated: &quot;I consider the production a personal gratification ... My only complaint is that you made the poor hero of the anemic printed page a very limp object as compared with the power of your own personality which you infuse into his stage presentment&quot;. President Calvin Coolidge commented that the production was a &quot;public service&quot;. Booth Tarkington told him, &quot;I would rather see you play Sherlock Holmes than be a child again on Christmas morning.&quot;

Gillette&#x27;s last appearance on stage was in Austin Strong&#x27;s &quot;Three Wise Fools&quot; in 1936.

Gillette died on April 29, 1937, aged 83, in Hartford, due to a pulmonary hemorrhage. He was buried in the Hooker family plot at Riverside Cemetery, Farmington, Connecticut, next to his wife.

==Bibliography==
Gillette wrote 13 original plays, 7 adaptations and some collaborations, encompassing farce, melodrama and novel adaption. Two pieces based on the Civil War remain his greatest works: &quot;Held by the Enemy&quot; (1886) and &quot;Secret Service&quot; (1896). Both were successful with both the public and the critics, and &quot;Secret Service&quot; remains the only one of his plays available today on commercial VHS and DVD from a 1977 Broadway Theater Archive production starring John Lithgow and Meryl Streep.

===Radio===

*On October 20, 1930, Gillette performed the first serial radio-version of Sherlock Holmes in the premiere episode of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;. It was based on the original theater version by Conan Doyle, re-adapted by Edith Meiser, and was the first time Holmes was portrayed on radio as part of a continuing series. It was transmitted by WEAF-NBC (New York) and sponsored by &quot;G. Washington Coffee Co.&quot;. This show became the pilot of a series and, after Gillette, Richard Gordon took over the part for the remaining 34 programs in the series.
*On November 18, 1935, Gillette, now 82 years old, performed his own &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, broadcasting from a WABC (AM) radio studio in New York City. His play was again re-adapted by Meiser. Reginald Mason played Dr. Watson and Charles Bryant played Professor Moriarty. Its duration was 50 minutes. This play was the pilot for a new Holmes series. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Gillette was &quot;still the best, with all his shades and improvisation&quot;.

In past years, in November, the town of Tryon celebrated the &quot;William Gillette Festival&quot;, honoring Gillette. The Polk County Historical Museum there displays Gillete&#x27;s pipe and slippers from his farewell tour of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, as well as china, some letters and other items left behind at the actor&#x27;s North Carolina home.

===New York City===
On December 7, 1934, Gillette attended the first dinner meeting of The Baker Street Irregulars in New York. As of 2011, the BSI continues its William Gillette Memorial Luncheon on the Friday afternoon of their annual January meeting in New York City.

<doc id="314926" wikidata="Q225422" url="?curid=314926" title="Men Without Hats">
<text>Men Without Hats are a Canadian new wave and synth-pop band, originally from Montreal, Quebec. Their music is characterized by the baritone voice of their lead singer Ivan Doroschuk, as well as their elaborate use of synthesizers and electronic processing. They achieved their greatest popularity in the 1980s with &quot;The Safety Dance&quot;, a worldwide top ten hit (No. 3 in the United States), and &quot;Pop Goes the World&quot;. After a hiatus for most of the 1990s and 2000s, Doroschuk reformed the band in 2010, and released &quot;Love in the Age of War&quot; (2012). The group, based in Vancouver, has continued to perform, including tour dates in support of the release of two studio albums, &quot;Men Without Hats Again (Parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot;, in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

==History==

===Early days===
Men Without Hats was founded in Montreal in 1977, initially as a punk rock band featuring Ivan Doroschuk (vocals), Pete Seabrooke (guitar), Dave Hill (bass), and John Gurrin (drums). In 1980, Doroschuk restarted Men Without Hats, giving the name to a new synthesizer-based group that he formed with Jérémie Arrobas (vocals, keyboards) and his brothers Stefan Doroschuk (bass) and Colin Doroschuk (guitar). Influences on this electronic outfit included Gary Numan, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) and Ultravox. Years earlier, while in high school, Arrobas and the Doroschuk brothers had played together in a short-lived band called Wave 21, along with drummer Igor Krichevsky. Many years later, Stefan would reuse the Wave 21 name for a country-pop band founded in the late 2010s with his daughters Mary-Lynn and Emmy-Lou.

The Doroschuk brothers, all three of whom are classically trained musicians, were born in Champaign, Illinois while their father, a Canadian, was earning a doctoral degree. They moved to Montreal as young children when their parents returned to Canada. The group&#x27;s name came about because the brothers, following a self-described principle of &quot;style before comfort&quot;, refused to wear hats during Montreal&#x27;s cold winters, calling themselves &quot;the men without hats&quot;.

In addition to the Doroschuks, the group has also included numerous additional members and guest or touring performers, many of whom quickly came and left during the first five years. Frontman and songwriter Ivan Doroschuk was the only constant member, while Stefan and Colin Doroschuk as well as Arrobas remained as relatively steady members through the early 1980s.

Their first recording to be released was the 1980 EP &quot;Folk of the 80&#x27;s&quot;. At this point, the band had changed styles from punk to new wave and officially consisted of Ivan (vocals, bass) and Arrobas (keyboards); also appearing on the EP were auxiliary members Stefan Doroschuk (bass), Roman Martyn (guitars), and Lysanne Thibodeau (backing vocals).

Shortly after the release of the debut EP, Martyn left and was replaced by Jean-Marc Pisapia, who stayed only a short time before leaving, and later founded The Box. Pisapia was replaced briefly by Tracy Howe, who also left in short order, co-founding Rational Youth shortly after his departure. Howe was replaced by keyboardist Mike Gabriel. Arrobas and Gabriel left the group just before the recording of the next album.

===International success===
Ivan and Stefan (now promoted to full membership status) subsequently recruited Allan McCarthy (percussion, electronics) to join the group, and recorded their 1982 full-length debut album &quot;Rhythm of Youth&quot;. The trio subsequently enjoyed a hit in Canada with &quot;The Safety Dance&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 in May 1983. The song soon charted in the United States, spending four weeks at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was a major hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 6. The song also reached the top ten in various other European countries, and peaked at No. 2 in New Zealand and No. 1 in South Africa, where it was the 11th highest-selling single of 1983.

Adding Pierre (who had guested on &quot;Rhythm of Youth&quot;) as an official fourth member, Men Without Hats released the album &quot;Folk of the 80&#x27;s (Part III)&quot; in 1984. While lead single &quot;Where Do The Boys Go?&quot; was a top 40 hit in Canada, the album failed to match the international success of &quot;Rhythm of Youth&quot;.

In 1985, the band released the EP &quot;Freeways&quot;, consisting of multiple (and multi-lingual) remixes of one of their earliest efforts, Ivan and Arrobas&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Freeways&quot; (which had previously been released as a B-side in 1982). To support the EP, the group undertook a related tour, footage from which would later (in 2006) be released on DVD as &quot;Live Hats&quot;.

Reshuffling the line-up again, the band released the album &quot;Pop Goes the World&quot; in 1987 with Ivan, Stefan, and Lenny Pinkas. The song &quot;Pop Goes the World&quot; reached No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 2 on the Canadian Singles Chart, and was No. 1 in Austria. The song was featured in the 1987 film &quot;Date with an Angel&quot;, and became the fifteenth biggest selling single in South Africa for 1988.

The group&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Adventures of Women &amp; Men Without Hate in the 21st Century&quot;, released in 1989, featured a cover of ABBA&#x27;s song &quot;SOS&quot;. The musicians on the album were essentially the touring band from &quot;Pop Goes the World&quot;, which included Bruce Murphy on keyboards and guitar, Marika Tjelios on bass, Richard Sampson on drums, and Heidi Garcia on vocals and keyboards.

The 1991 album &quot;Sideways&quot;, dominated by electric guitars instead of keyboards, revealed a dramatically different sound for the band, based in part on Ivan&#x27;s exposure to Nirvana. Ivan said &quot;We had a contractual obligation for one more album with PolyGram so I said to them, we&#x27;ll take half of the allotted budget if they would allow us to do the record I wanted...so we did this guitar-oriented record but PolyGram were horrified. &#x27;Men Without Hats without keyboards aren&#x27;t going to work,&#x27; they claimed and that was the end of the story with PolyGram.&quot; The line-up on the album was Ivan on vocals, Félix Matte on lead guitar, John Kastner on rhythm guitar, Stefan on bass, Michel Langevin on drums and Colin on keyboards.

The group officially disbanded in 1993, after the career setback of failing to attract another American label as a result of the negative reception to &quot;Sideways&quot;. The band&#x27;s final concert was a benefit to support a women&#x27;s shelter in Montreal, with guitarist Denis D&#x27;Amour replacing Matte and Kastner, who both had left the band in 1992.

===Projects during the 1990s and 2000s===
After disbanding, lead singer Ivan and keyboardist Bruce Murphy went on to record several demos in 1993 for a concept album tentatively titled &quot;UFO&#x27;s Are Real&quot;, which was never released. Ivan recorded and released the solo album &quot;The Spell&quot; in 1997. Former band member Allan McCarthy died due to AIDS complications in 1995. Under the name MacKenzie-Parker Gang, Stefan and Mack MacKenzie (of the Canadian alt-country band Three O&#x27;Clock Train) released &quot;Ride for Glory&quot; (1999), a post-modern Western-themed album.

After a 10-year hiatus, &quot;No Hats Beyond This Point&quot; was released in November 2003, returning the band to their early new wave style. In interviews around the time of the release, the band had mentioned a tour to support the release and a box set dedicated to the band&#x27;s early years, which included the &quot;Folk of the 80&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Freeways&quot; EPs, the band&#x27;s first two albums, a concert that was televised in 1985, unreleased demos and remixes of &quot;The Safety Dance&quot;. None of this came to fruition, though, and the band split up once again in early 2004. This was the end of Stefan&#x27;s involvement with Men Without Hats.

Colin released two albums with his side solo project &quot;Centrifugal Force&quot; [&quot;Matter&quot;, &quot;Excerpts from Matter&quot;], then focued on opera and classical music, first serving as Artistic Director of Montreal&#x27;s Northern Opera Theatre (85-91) and later as composer-in-residence at British Columbia&#x27;s Ballet Victoria. His works include the ballets &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, operas &quot;Medea Metamorphoses&quot;, an opera-dance project with the Victoria Symphony &amp; the Coast-Saalish First Nation dancers &quot;Heaven&quot;; A full production of his opera &quot;Evangeline&quot;, based on a Longfellow poem, was produced by L&#x27;Opera de Rimouski in 2014, and was conducted by Doroschuk. 

In 2006, the Trilogie Musique label released a DVD titled &quot;Live Hats&quot;, featuring a 1985 live concert at Le Spectrum theater in Montreal on August 8, 1985 that had been televised. The release was unauthorized by the band, and it was pulled out of print.

===Reformation in 2010===
Ivan reformed Men Without Hats in 2010 as the frontman and lead vocalist, and was joined by musicians Derek Mansfield (synths) James Love (guitar) &amp; Lou Dawson (synths) The band returned on September 24, 2010, at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia, performing ten songs and hits from the Men Without Hats back catalogue. The revived band was described by the Austin American-Statesman&quot; as &quot;simply singer Ivan Doroschuk and hired guns&quot; and by Stefan as a &quot;tribute band&quot;. Despite these initial reactions, the band&#x27;s &quot;Dance If You Want Tour&quot; opened in March 2011 with a well-attended and positively received performance at Austin&#x27;s South by Southwest event.

In June 2011, Ivan told a festival audience that the group would record a new studio album, announcing the news at North by Northeast in Toronto. The album was originally to be titled &quot;Folk of the 80&#x27;s (Part IV)&quot;, but in March 2012, the band posted on Facebook that it would be called &quot;Love in the Age of War&quot; and would be released that summer.

&quot;Love in the Age of War&quot;, produced by Dave Ogilvie of Skinny Puppy, was released in June 2012 and received mostly favorable reviews. Ogilvie and Doroschuk set out to faithfully reproduce and update the group&#x27;s classic synthesizer sound of the 1980s, intentionally making a follow-up album to 1982&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm of Youth&quot;. According to Doroschuk, they pretended to be &quot;working on a 24-track machine, for example, and not the virtual, infinity-plus-one number of tracks that you can get today. We went out and got the old synths that we used back then... the identical instruments, so it wasn&#x27;t soft synths, it was really real synthesizers.&quot;

By 2011, Doroschuk had taken on three of his touring musicians as full band members: James Love on guitar and backing vocals, Louise (Lou) Dawson on keyboards and backing vocals, and Mark Olexson on keyboards and backing vocals, all of whom performed on &quot;Love in the Age of War&quot;. Colin Doroschuk also appeared on the album as a vocalist. After the album was recorded, Doroschuk doubled down on the band&#x27;s synthesizer-heavy sound by replacing Olexson with Vancouver musician Rachel Ashmore, on keyboards and backing vocals, as the group&#x27;s second synthesist.

Men Without Hats again toured the United States in 2013, as part of the 1980s-themed &quot;Regeneration Tour&quot;, with contemporaries such as Howard Jones, Andy Bell of Erasure, and Berlin. The band&#x27;s continuing activity has included tours in Europe in 2015 and 2016.

As part of a &quot;Totally &#x27;80s&quot; show that toured Australia in July 2016, Doroschuk performed as Men Without Hats without other band members, &quot;singing with the house band...[to] set the stage for a proper visit with the full band&quot;. In October 2016, prior to a European tour, Sho Murray replaced Love as guitarist.

On January 28, 2020, Ivan announced that he was working on a follow-up to &quot;Love in the Age of War&quot;, to be titled &quot;Again (Parts 1 and 2)&quot;. A new lineup of the band recorded the two studio albums in Vancouver between July 2020 and January 2021, to be released separately in 2021 and 2022 on the band&#x27;s new label, Sonic Envy. Twelve new original songs were recorded for &quot;Again (Part 2)&quot;, which included &quot;Heaven&quot;, a song written in 1985 and performed on the &quot;Freeways&quot; tour but never recorded in the studio. The five-song &quot;Again (Part 1)&quot; EP includes a collection of cover songs and a &quot;re-invention&quot; of &quot;Safety Dance&quot; titled “No Friends of Mine&quot;. The band announced tour dates beginning in June 2021, with a lineup consisting of Ivan on lead vocals and electronics, Colin Doroschuk on vocals, guitar, and keyboards, and Sho Murray on guitar. Colin’s daughter, soprano Sahara Sloan, provided additional vocals on the recording.

In 2024, Men Without Hats toured as part of the &quot;Abducted by the 80&#x27;s&quot; tour across the US and Canada with fellow 80s acts Wang Chung, The Motels, and Naked Eyes, as well as the &quot;Totally Tubular Festival&quot; with Tom Bailey, Thomas Dolby, and others.

<text>Andreas Maria Maximilian [[Freiherr]] von Mauchenheim genannt Bechtolsheim (born 30 September 1955) is a German electrical engineer, entrepreneur and investor. He co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. he was 68th wealthiest according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index and &quot;Forbes&quot; with an estimated net worth of US$28.9billion.

==Early life and education==
Bechtolsheim was born at Hängeberg am Ammersee, located in Finning, Landsberg, Bavaria, the second of four children. The isolated house had no television or close neighbors, so he experimented with electronics as a child. His family moved to Rome in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, the family relocated again, to Nonnenhorn on Lake Constance in Germany. At age 16, he designed an industrial controller for a nearby company based on the Intel 8008, which he then programmed in binary code as he had no access to assemblers. Royalties from the product supported much of his education.

Bechtolsheim entered the Jugend forscht contest for young researchers, and after entering for three years, won the physics prize in 1974. He began studying electrical engineering with a focus on data processing at the Technical University of Munich with the support of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation 
and graduated with an Engineering degree Andreas was annoyed that the students did not have access to computers and frustrated by his studies at the time, he went to Carnegie Mellon University in 1975 with the help of a Fulbright scholarship, and obtained his Master&#x27;s degree in Computer Engineering in 1976. In 1977, Bechtolsheim moved to Silicon Valley based on the offer of an Intel internship from Justin Rattner. When Rattner moved to Oregon, Bechtolsheim instead went to Stanford University and became a Ph.D. student in electrical engineering in 1977 exiting Stanford 5 years later.

==Career==

At Stanford, Bechtolsheim designed a powerful computer (called a workstation) with built-in networking called the SUN workstation, a name derived from the initials for the Stanford University Network. It was inspired by the Xerox Alto computer developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. Bechtolsheim was a &quot;no fee consultant&quot; at Xerox, meaning he was not remunerated directly but had free access to the research being done there. At the time, Lynn Conway was using workstations to design very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits.

Bechtolsheim&#x27;s advisor was Forest Baskett. In 1980, Vaughan Pratt also provided leadership to the SUN project. Support was provided by the Computer Science Department and DARPA. The modular computer was used for research projects such as developing the V-System, and for early Internet routers. Bechtolsheim tried to interest other companies in manufacturing the workstations, but only got lukewarm responses.

===Founding Sun===
One of the companies building computers for VLSI design was Daisy Systems, where Vinod Khosla worked at the time. Khosla had graduated a couple of years earlier from the Stanford Graduate School of Business with Scott McNealy, who managed manufacturing at Onyx Systems. Khosla, McNealy and Bechtolsheim wrote a short business plan and quickly received funding from venture capitalists in 1982. Bechtolsheim left Stanford to co-found the company, Sun Microsystems, as employee number one, with McNealy and Khosla, and with Bill Joy, who had been part of the team developing the BSD series of Unix operating systems at UC Berkeley; Bill is usually counted as the fourth member of the founding team. For a while Bechtolsheim and Joy shared an apartment in Palo Alto, California.
The first product, the Sun-1, included the Stanford CPU board design with improved memory expansion, and a sheet-metal case. By the end of the year, the experimental Ethernet interface designed by Bechtolsheim was replaced by a commercial board from 3Com.

Sun Microsystems had its initial public offering in 1986 and reached $1 billion in sales by 1988. Bechtolsheim formed a project code-named UniSun around this time to design a small, inexpensive desktop computer for the educational market. The result was the SPARCstation 1 (known as &quot;campus&quot;), the start of another line of Sun products.

===Other companies===
In 1995, Bechtolsheim left Sun to found Granite Systems, a Gigabit Ethernet startup focused on developing high-speed network switches. In 1996, Cisco Systems acquired the firm for $220 million, with Bechtolsheim owning 60%. He became vice president and general manager of Cisco&#x27;s Gigabit Systems Business Unit, until leaving the company in December 2003 to head Kealia, Inc.

Bechtolsheim founded Kealia in early 2001 with Stanford Professor David Cheriton, a partner in Granite Systems, to work on advanced server technologies using the Opteron processor from Advanced Micro Devices. In February 2004, Sun Microsystems announced it was acquiring Kealia in a stock swap. Due to the acquisition, Bechtolsheim returned to Sun again as senior vice president and chief architect. Kealia hardware technology was used in the Sun Fire X4500 storage product.

Along with Cheriton, in 2005 Bechtolsheim launched another high-speed networking company, Arastra. Arastra later changed its name to Arista Networks. Bechtolsheim left Sun Microsystems to become the Chairman and Chief Development Officer of Arista in October, 2008, but stated he still was associated with Sun in an advisory role.

===Investments===

Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were two of the first investors in Google, investing US$100,000 each in September 1998. When he gave the check to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google&#x27;s founders, the company had not yet been legally incorporated. Claims that Bechtolsheim coined the name &quot;Google&quot; are untrue. However, he did motivate the founders to officially organize the company under that name.

As a result of investments like these, Bechtolsheim was seen as one of the most successful &quot;angel investors&quot;, particularly in areas such as electronic design automation (EDA), which refers to the software used by people designing computer chips. He has made a number of successful investments in EDA. In one such EDA company, Magma Design Automation, his stake was valued around $60 million. He was an early investor in another EDA start-up company, Co-Design Automation, which developed SystemVerilog which is used to design almost all digital hardware.

Bechtolsheim invested in Tapulous, the maker of music games for the Apple iPhone. Tapulous was acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 2010. He joined George T. Haber, a former colleague at Sun, to invest in wireless chip company CrestaTech in 2006 and 2008.

Bechtolsheim invested in all of Haber&#x27;s previous startups: CompCore purchased by Zoran, GigaPixel purchased by 3Dfx and Mobilygen purchased by Maxim Integrated Products in 2008, as well as Moovweb, a cloud-based interface for mobile and computer websites in 2009.

He was reportedly an early investor in Claria Corporation, which ceased operating in 2008. From 2015 to 2017, Bechtolsheim invested in PerimeterX, an automated attack mitigation SaaS.

===Awards===
Bechtolsheim received a Smithsonian Leadership Award for Innovation in 1999 and a Stanford Entrepreneur Company of the year award. He was also elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2000 for contributions to the design of computer workstations and high-performance network switching.

Bechtolsheim gave the opening keynote speech at the International Supercomputing Conference in 2009.

In 2012, he was voted by IT Pros as the person who contributed most to server innovation in the last 20 years.

===SEC settlement===
In 2024, Bechtolsheim settled insider trading allegations with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in which he agreed to pay a civil penalty of nearly $1 million, and is prohibited from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The SEC accused him of misusing confidential knowledge of Cisco&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Acacia Communications, stating that the illegal option trades netted over $400,000 in profits between his associate and relative, to whom he passed the information.

==Personal life==
Despite living most of his life in the US, Bechtolsheim never attempted to acquire US citizenship. He remains a German national.

<doc id="314928" wikidata="Q1756633" url="?curid=314928" title="Aquatic animal">
<text>An aquatic animal is any animal, whether vertebrate or invertebrate, that lives in a body of water for all or most of its lifetime. Aquatic animals generally conduct gas exchange in water by extracting dissolved oxygen via specialised respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or across enteral mucosae, although some are evolved from terrestrial ancestors that re-adapted to aquatic environments (e.g. marine reptiles and marine mammals), in which case they actually use lungs to breathe air and are essentially holding their breath when living in water. Some species of gastropod mollusc, such as the eastern emerald sea slug, are even capable of kleptoplastic photosynthesis via endosymbiosis with ingested yellow-green algae.

Almost all aquatic animals reproduce in water, either oviparously or viviparously, and many species routinely migrate between different water bodies during their life cycle. Some animals have fully aquatic life stages (typically as eggs and larvae), while as adults they become terrestrial or semi-aquatic after undergoing metamorphosis. Such examples include amphibians such as frogs, many flying insects such as mosquitoes, mayflies, dragonflies, damselflies and caddisflies, as well as some species of cephalopod molluscs such as the algae octopus (whose larvae are completely planktonic, but adults are highly terrestrial).

Aquatic animals are a diverse polyphyletic group based purely on the natural environments they inhabit, and many morphological and behavioral similarities among them are the result of convergent evolution. They are distinct from terrestrial and semi-aquatic animals, who can survive away from water bodies, while aquatic animals often die of dehydration or hypoxia after prolonged removal out of water due to either gill failure or compressive asphyxia by their own body weight (as in the case of whale beaching). Along with aquatic plants, algae and microbes, aquatic animals form the food webs of various marine, brackish and freshwater aquatic ecosystems.

==Description==

The term aquatic can be applied to animals that live in either fresh water or salt water. However, the adjective marine is most commonly used for animals that live in saltwater or sometimes brackish water, i.e. in oceans, shallow seas, estuaries, etc.

Aquatic animals can be separated into four main groups according to their positions within the water column.
* Neustons (&quot;floaters&quot;), more specifically the &quot;zooneustons&quot;, inhabit the surface ecosystem and use buoyancy to stay at the water surface, sometimes with appendages hanging from the underside for foraging (e.g. Portuguese man o&#x27; war, chondrophores and the buoy barnacle). They only move around via passive locomotion, meaning they have vagility but no motility.
* Planktons (&quot;drifters&quot;), more specifically the metazoan zooplanktons, are suspended within the water column with no motility (most aquatic larvae) or limited motility (e.g. jellyfish, salps, larvaceans, and escape responses of copepods), causing them to be mostly carried by the water currents.
* Nektons (&quot;swimmers&quot;) have active motility that are strong enough to propel and overcome the influence of water currents. These are the aquatic animals most familiar to the common knowledge, as their movements are obvious on the macroscopic scale and the cultivation and harvesting of their biomass is most important to humans as seafoods. Nektons often have powerful tails, paddle/fan-shaped appendages with large wetted surfaces (e.g. fins, flippers or webbed feet) and/or jet propulsion (in the case of cephalopods) to achieve aquatic locomotion.
* Benthos (&quot;bottom dwellers&quot;) inhabit the benthic zone at the floor of water bodies, which include both shallow sea (coastal, littoral and neritic) and deep sea communities. These animals include sessile organisms (e.g. sponges, sea anemones, corals, sea pens, sea lilies and sea squirts, some of which are reef-builders crucial to the biodiversity of marine ecosystems), sedentary filter feeders (e.g. bivalve molluscs) and ambush predators (e.g. flatfishes and bobbit worms, who often burrow or camouflage within the marine sediment), and more actively moving bottom feeders who swim (e.g. demersal fishes) and crawl around (e.g. decapod crustaceans, marine chelicerates, octopus, most non-bivalvian molluscs, echinoderms etc.). Many benthic animals are algivores, detrivores and scavengers who are important basal consumers and intermediate recyclers in the marine nitrogen cycle.

Aquatic animals (especially freshwater animals) are often of special concern to conservationists because of the fragility of their environments. Aquatic animals are subject to pressure from overfishing/hunting, destructive fishing, water pollution, acidification, climate change and competition from invasive species. Many aquatic ecosystems are at risk of habitat destruction/fragmentation, which puts aquatic animals at risk as well. Aquatic animals play an important role in the world. The biodiversity of aquatic animals provide food, energy, and even jobs.

=== Freshwater aquatic animals ===
Fresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for organisms with pervious skins and gills, whose cell membranes may rupture if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles, while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney. Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh and saline water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The European eel (&quot;Anguilla anguilla&quot;) uses the hormone prolactin, while in salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;) the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process.

Freshwater molluscs include freshwater snails and freshwater bivalves. Freshwater crustaceans include freshwater shrimps, crabs, crayfish and copepods.

=== Air-breathing aquatic animals ===
In addition to water-breathing animals (e.g. fish, most molluscs, etc.), the term &quot;aquatic animal&quot; can be applied to air-breathing tetrapods who have evolved for aquatic life. The most proliferative extant group are the marine mammals, such as Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises, with some freshwater species) and Sirenia (dugongs and manatees), who are too evolved for aquatic life to survive on land at all (where they will die of beaching), as well as the highly aquatically adapted but land-dwelling pinnipeds (true seals, eared seals and the walrus). The term &quot;aquatic mammal&quot; is also applied to riparian mammals like the river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;) and beavers (family Castoridae), although they are technically semiaquatic or amphibious. Unlike the more common gill-bearing aquatic animals, these air-breathing animals have lungs (which are homologous to the swim bladders in bony fish) and need to surface periodically to change breaths, but their ranges are not restricted by oxygen saturation in water, although salinity changes can still affect their physiology to an extent. 

There are also reptilian animals that are highly evolved for life in water, although most extant aquatic reptiles, including crocodilians, turtles, water snakes and the marine iguana, are technically semi-aquatic rather than fully aquatic, and most of them only inhabit freshwater ecosystems. Marine reptiles were once a dominant group of ocean predators that altered the marine fauna during the Mesozoic, although most of them died out during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and now only the sea turtles (the only remaining descendants of the Mesozoic marine reptiles) and sea snakes (which only evolved during the Cenozoic) remain fully aquatic in saltwater ecosystems. 

Amphibians, while still requiring access to water to inhabit, are separated into their own ecological classification. The majority of amphibians — except the order Gymnophiona (caecilians), which are mainly terrestrial burrowers — have a fully aquatic larval form known as tadpoles, but those from the order Anura (frogs and toads) and some of the order Urodela (salamanders) will metamorphosize into lung-bearing and sometimes skin-breathing terrestrial adults, and most of them may return to the water to breed. Axolotl, a Mexican salamander that retains its larval external gills into adulthood, is the only extant amphibian that remains fully aquatic throughout the entire life cycle. 

Certain amphibious fish also evolved to breathe air to survive oxygen-deprived waters, such as lungfishes, mudskippers, labyrinth fishes, bichirs, arapaima and walking catfish. Their abilities to breathe atmospheric oxygen are achieved via skin-breathing, enteral respiration, or specialized gill organs such as the labyrinth organ and even primitive lungs (lungfish and bichirs). 

Most molluscs have gills, while some freshwater gastropods (e.g. &quot;Planorbidae&quot;) have evolved pallial lungs and some amphibious species (e.g. &quot;Ampullariidae&quot;) have both. Many species of octopus have cutaneous respiration that allows them to survive out of water at the intertidal zones, with at least one species (&quot;Abdopus aculeatus&quot;) being routinely terrestrial hunting crabs among the tidal pools of rocky shores. 

== Importance ==
=== Environmental ===
Aquatic animals play an important role for the environment as indicator species, as they are particularly sensitive to deterioration in water quality and climate change. Biodiversity of aquatic animals is also an important factor for the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems as it reflects the food web status and the carrying capacity of the local habitats. Many migratory aquatic animals, predominantly forage fish (such as sardines) and euryhaline fish (such as salmon), are keystone species that accumulate and transfer biomass between marine, freshwater and even to terrestrial ecosystems.
=== Importance to humans ===

==== As a food source ====
Aquatic animals are important to humans as a source of food (i.e. seafood) and as raw material for fodders (e.g. feeder fish and fish meal), pharmaceuticals (e.g. fish oil, krill oil, cytarabine and bryostatin) and various industrial chemicals (e.g. chitin and bioplastics, formerly also whale oil). The harvesting of aquatic animals, especially finfish, shellfish and inkfish, provides direct and indirect employment to the livelihood of over 500 million people in developing countries, and both the fishing industry and aquaculture make up a major component of the primary sector of the economy.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that global consumption of aquatic animals in 2022 was 185 million tonnes (live weight equivalent), an increase of 4 percent from 2020. The value of the 2022 global trade was estimated at USD 452 billion, comprising USD 157 billion for wild fisheries and USD 296 billion for aquaculture. Of the total 185 million tonnes of aquatic animals produced in 2022, about 164.6 million tonnes (89%) were destined for human consumption, equivalent to an estimated 20.7 kg per capita. The remaining 20.8 million tonnes were destined for non-food uses, to produce mainly fishmeal and fish oil. In 2022, China remained the major producer (36% of the total), followed by India (8%), Indonesia (7%), Vietnam (5%) and Peru (3%).

Total fish production in 2016 reached an all-time high of 171 million tonnes, of which 88% was utilized for direct human consumption, resulting in a record-high per capita consumption of . Since 1961 the annual global growth in fish consumption has been twice as high as population growth. While annual growth of aquaculture has declined in recent years, significant double-digit growth is still recorded in some countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. Overfishing and destructive fishing practices fuelled by commercial incentives have reduced fish stocks beyond sustainable levels in many world regions, causing the fishery industry to maladaptively fishing down the food web. It was estimated in 2014 that global fisheries were adding US$270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by as much as US$50 billion. UN Food and Agriculture Organization projects world production of aquatic animals to reach 205 million tonnes by 2032.

Where sex-disaggregated data are available, approximately 24 percent of the total workforce were women; of these, 53 percent were employed in the sector on a full-time basis, a great improvement since 1995, when only 32 percent of women were employed full time.

Aquatic animal are highly perishable and several chemical and biological changes take place immediately after death; this can result in spoilage and food safety risks if good handling and preservation practices are not applied all along the supply chain. These practices are based on temperature reduction (chilling and freezing), heat treatment (canning, boiling and smoking), reduction of available water (drying, salting and smoking) and changing of the storage environment (vacuum packing, modified atmosphere packaging and refrigeration). Aquatic animal products also require special facilities such as cold storage and refrigerated transport, and rapid delivery to consumers.

==== Recreational fishing ====
In addition to commercial and subsistence fishing, recreational fishing is a popular pastime in both developed and developing countries, and the manufacturing, retail and service sectors associated with recreational fishing have together conglomerated into a multibillion-dollar industry. In 2014 alone, around 11 million saltwater sportfishing participants the United States generated USD$58 billion of retail revenue (comparatively, commercial fishing generated USD$141 billion that same year). In 2021, the total revenue of recreational fishing industry in the United States overtook those of Lockheed Martin, Intel, Chrysler and Google; and together with personnel salary (about USD$39.5 billion) and various tolls and fees collected by fisheries management agencies (about USD$17 billion), contributed almost USD$129 billion to the GDP of the United States, roughly 1% of the national GDP and more than the economic sum of 17 U.S. states.

<text>Wham-O Inc. is an American toy company based in Carson, California, United States. It is known for creating and marketing many popular toys for nearly 70 years, including the Hula hoop, Frisbee, Slip &#x27;N Slide, Super Ball, Trac-Ball, Silly String, Hacky sack, Wham-O Bird Ornithopter and Boogie Board, many of which have become genericized trademarks.

==Corporate history==
Richard Knerr (1925–2008) and Arthur &quot;Spud&quot; Melin (1924–2002), two University of Southern California graduates who were friends since their teens, were unhappy with their jobs and decided to start their own business. In 1948 they formed the WHAM-O Manufacturing Company in the Knerr family garage in South Pasadena. Their first product was the Wham-O Slingshot, made of ash wood, which Knerr and Melin promoted by holding demonstrations of their own slingshot skills. The name &quot;Wham-O&quot; was inspired by the sound of the slingshot&#x27;s shot hitting the target. The powerful slingshot was adopted by clubs for competitive target shooting and small game hunting. When they outgrew the garage, Knerr and Melin rented a building on S. Marengo Ave in Alhambra, California; and then, in 1955, moved their manufacturing plant to neighboring San Gabriel, California where they remained until 1987, when they sold the plant to Huy Fong Foods.

==Products and marketing==

In 1957, Wham-O, still a fledgling company, took the idea of Australian bamboo &quot;exercise hoops&quot;, manufactured them in Marlex, and called their new product the Hula Hoop. (The name had been used since the 18th century, but until then was not registered as a trademark.) It became the biggest toy fad in modern history. 25 million were sold in four months, and in two years sales reached more than 100 million. &quot;Hula Hoop mania&quot; continued through the end of 1959, and netted Wham-O $45 million (equivalent to $ in 2025).

Shortly thereafter, the company had another huge success with the Frisbee. In 1955 inventor Fred Morrison began marketing a plastic flying disc called the Pluto Platter. He sold the design to Wham-O on January 23, 1957. By June they had learned that students back east were calling them a &quot;Frisbee.&quot; In early 1958 Wham-O added the name &quot;Frisbee&quot; to the top of the Pluto Platter – and once again a Wham-O toy became a common part of life through the 1960s.

In the early 1960s Wham-O created the Super Ball, a high-bouncing ball made of a hard elastomer Polybutadiene alloy, dubbed Zectron, with a 0.92 coefficient of restitution when bounced on hard surfaces. Around 20 million Super Balls were sold that decade, and the NFL named the Super Bowl games after it.

The Frisbee and Hula Hoop created fads. With other products, Wham-O tried to capitalize on existing national trends. In the 1960s they produced a US$119 do-it-yourself bomb shelter cover. In 1962, they sold a limbo dance kit to take advantage of that fad; and in 1975, when the movie Jaws was released, they sold plastic shark teeth.

Many products were not successful. During an African safari in the early 1960s, Melin discovered a species of fish that laid eggs in the mud during Africa&#x27;s dry season. When the rains came, the eggs hatched and fish emerged overnight. This inspired Melin to create the product, an aquarium kit consisting of some of the fish eggs, and some mud in which to hatch them.

==Other products==
* Wham-O Bird Ornithopter (1959) sold in a large cardboard box, ready to fly. Made of aluminum spars, wood, steel wire and mylar, it was brightly painted to resemble a hawk or owl. The retail price for the rubber-band-powered toy was $3 (about $24 in 2020 money). About 600,000 were made.
*Wheelie Bar (1966) for wheelie bikes, especially well suited for the popular Schwinn Sting-Ray. The packaging design, featuring 1960s character Rat Fink, was widely reproduced on T-shirts, posters and decals. The television commercial featured Kathryn Minner, the original Little Old Lady from Pasadena.
* Air Blaster (1965), which shot a puff of air that could blow out a candle at 20 feet

==Strategy==
Knerr and Melin marketed their products directly to children, including demonstrating their toys at playgrounds. They extensively researched new product ideas, including traveling around the world. &quot;If Spud and I had to say what we contributed,&quot; Knerr said, &quot;it was fun. But I think this country gave us more than we gave it. It gave us the opportunity to do it.&quot;

For many years, the company&#x27;s strategy was to maintain eight to twelve simple, inexpensive products such as Frisbees, Super Balls, and Hula Hoops. New products were developed for tryout periods. Old ones were retired, for a few years or permanently, as their popularity waned. Since the toys were simple and inexpensive, they could be sold by a wide range of retailers, from large Department Stores to five and dime stores.

As Wham-O changed ownership, its new management adjusted this formula to accommodate the changing toy industry, which had increasingly complex toys and fewer distribution channels.

By 2006 Wham-O&#x27;s product line included several groups of related items using licensed brand names. For example, Sea-Doo is a brand of personal water craft owned by Bombardier; Wham-O makes a Sea-Doo line of small inflatable rafts designed to be towed behind watercraft.

The company&#x27;s lines are also more complex, and grouped in related categories—for example, the Sea-Doo line (about a dozen products), several Slip &#x27;N Slide variations, and a group of &quot;lawn games&quot;.

On January 31, 2011, Wham-O announced an agreement with ICM, the agency representing Atari video games, to represent Wham-O in movies, television, music, and online content based around its toys.

They are nicknamed &quot;the Blades&quot; due to Sheffield&#x27;s history of cutlery production. The team have played home games at Bramall Lane since their formation. For most of the club&#x27;s history, United have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their main rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City derby.
Sheffield United was formed as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club in 1889. Following strong performances in the Midland League and Northern League, they were invited to become a founding member of the Football League Second Division in 1892. They won promotion to the First Division at the end of the 1892–93 season, the first team to do so, and went on to be crowned English football champions in 1897–98. United went on to win the FA Cup on four occasions: 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925; and were beaten finalists in 1901. They spent 41 years in the top-flight before being relegated in 1934. United finished as FA Cup runners-up in 1936 and were promoted as runners-up of the Second Division in 1938–39.

United won the Second Division title in 1952–53, following relegation in 1949. They spent the next three decades between the First and Second Divisions, winning promotions in 1960–61 and 1970–71 after relegations in 1956 and 1968. However, a slow decline saw the club drop to the fourth tier by 1982, though they would win an immediate promotion as Fourth Division champions in 1981–82; this achievement meant that Sheffield United are one of only five sides to have won all four professional divisions of English football. Promoted in 1983–84, they recovered from relegation in 1988 to win consecutive promotions into the top-flight at the end of the 1989–90 campaign.

Sheffield United were founding members of the Premier League in the 1992–93 season, during which they scored the first ever goal of the competition. They were relegated in 1994 and after losing play-off finals in 1997 and 2003, the club finally regained their Premier League status at the end of the 2005–06 campaign under the stewardship of manager Neil Warnock. However, United were relegated the following year and dropped into League One in 2011. They spent six seasons in the third tier, losing in three play-off campaigns, before manager Chris Wilder led the club to promotion as champions in 2016–17. Promotion to the Premier League followed in 2018–19, though they returned to the Championship in 2021. The club played in the Premier League following a promotion from the EFL Championship in the 2022–23 season, but were relegated in the following season.

==History==


===Formation and glory years (1888–1975)===

The club was formed by members of the Sheffield United Cricket Club, formed in 1854 and the first English sports club to use &#x27;United&#x27; in its name. Sheffield United&#x27;s predominant nickname is &quot;The Blades&quot;, a reference to Sheffield&#x27;s status as the major producer of cutlery in the United Kingdom. United&#x27;s original nickname was in fact &quot;The Cutlers&quot; from 1889 to 1912. City rivals Wednesday held the nickname &quot;The Blades&quot; in their early years, however in 1907 Wednesday officially became &quot;The Owls&quot;, in reference to their new ground in Owlerton, and United would later claim &quot;The Blades&quot; nickname for themselves.

Sheffield United officially formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club, Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove after a dispute over gate receipts and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.

Undoubtedly United&#x27;s heyday was the 30-year period from 1895 to 1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners-up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and League Cup.

===Fall from grace and brief revival (1975–1994)===
Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season, and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league&#x27;s basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.

They fell back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an F.A. Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.

===Financial trouble and fall to League One (1994–2013)===

They remained outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they qualified for the play-offs under Bassett&#x27;s successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the re-branded Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation. Neil Warnock resigned as manager after the Blades went down. The team also purchased Chinese club Chengdu Wuniu in 2006, and redesigned the club crest in the style of the Sheffield United badge and renamed the team &quot;Chengdu Blades&quot;. The team were dissolved in 2015.

The club struggled to come to terms with life back in the Championship, with a spiralling wage bill not being matched by the quality of the players brought in, and a succession of managers within a short period of time. The Blades reached the Championship playoff final in 2009 under Kevin Blackwell, but a period of decline then set in. The 2010–11 season proved disastrous, with the club employing three different managers in the span of a season, which ultimately ended in relegation to League One under Micky Adams, meaning they would play in the third tier of English football for the first time since 1989. United qualified for the League One play-offs in 2011–12 and 2012–13 but lost in the final and semi-final respectively.

===Saudi takeover and return to the top flight (2013–present)===

In September 2013, Abdullah bin Mosaad Al Saud of the House of Saud had bought a 50 per cent stake in United&#x27;s parent company &quot;Blades Leisure Ltd&quot;. Both parties, at that time, agreed to include a &quot;roulette notice&quot; mechanism to end their arrangement when they no longer wished to work together. In 2014, United reached the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley Stadium but lost 5–3 to Hull City. In 2014–15, the team reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and semi-finals of the Football League Cup. United secured promotion back to the second tier in the 2016–17 season under the management of lifelong United fan and former player Chris Wilder, winning the League One title with 100 points. In late 2017, co-owner Kevin McCabe served a roulette notice on Prince Abdullah, giving him the option to sell his 50 per cent at £5 million or buy McCabe&#x27;s 50 per cent for the same price. Prince Abdullah chose to buy but McCabe refused to sell, a decision that ended up before the High Court of Justice.

In the 2018–19 season, Sheffield United achieved automatic promotion to the Premier League. United&#x27;s first season back in the Premier League, despite being tipped by many for relegation, produced a ninth-place finish. Despite this, ownership disputes between Prince Abdullah and McCabe continued. In September 2019, after 20 months of litigation, the High Court issued its judgment, requiring McCabe&#x27;s company to sell its shares in United. McCabe sought permission to appeal from the High Court and Court of Appeal but both appeals were rejected. As a result, Prince Abdullah became the sole beneficial owner of the club. The club had a very poor start to the 2020–21 season, winning just one of their opening 18 matches. Wilder left the club by mutual consent in March 2021. He was replaced by Paul Heckingbottom as caretaker manager, who could not prevent relegation at the end of the season. In May 2021, the club appointed Slaviša Jokanović as the new manager, making him the first overseas manager the club&#x27;s history. However, Jokanović was dismissed in November 2021 after a poor start to the season and Heckingbottom was reappointed as manager, this time on a permanent basis. Heckingbottom appointed former Sheffield United players Stuart McCall and Jack Lester as part of his coaching team. The 2021–22 season resulted in a fifth-place finish in the Championship, losing in the play-off semi-finals to Nottingham Forest on penalties. During the following season, Nigerian businessman Dozy Mmobuosi failed with an attempted £90 million takeover of the financially troubled club having reportedly paid a near-£10 million non-refundable deposit. By the end of the season, Heckingbottom had guided United back to the Premier League, securing automatic promotion with a second-place finish. The team also reached the FA Cup semi-finals, losing 3–0 to Manchester City at Wembley Stadium.

Sheffield United&#x27;s return to the Premier League for the 2023–24 season proved to be difficult and by early December they sat at the bottom of the league. The club&#x27;s board decided to sack Heckingbottom, replacing him with former Blades manager Chris Wilder. Despite the managerial change, the team&#x27;s poor form continued and their relegation back to the Championship was confirmed on 27 April 2024 following a 5–1 loss to Newcastle United. On 11 May 2024, after conceding the 101st goal of their campaign in a 1–0 defeat to Everton, Sheffield United set a new record for the most goals conceded in a single Premier League season, breaking Swindon Town&#x27;s record of 100 from the 1993–94 season. On the final matchday of the season, the club lost 3–0 to Tottenham Hotspur at home, finalizing their new record of 104 goals conceded, in addition to a goal difference of −69, matching Derby County&#x27;s record from the 2007–08 season. Furthermore, they set new records for goals conceded at home with 57, surpassing Aston Villa&#x27;s record from the 1935–36 season, and recorded a home goal difference of −38.

==Kits, colours and crest==

Sheffield United have played in red and white stripes for most of their history, but began playing in white shirts and blue shorts. They briefly played in narrow red stripes for the 1890–91 season, before returning to all-white the following year. The stripes returned in the 1892–93 season, with black shorts replacing the blue in 1904. The shirts remained largely unchanged until collars were first removed in 1955, replaced by V-necks until the 1966–67 season (when white socks were also used), and from here on the neck style varied.

The traditional red and white stripes remained until the 1974–75 season, when elements of black were added, until the 1979–81 and 82 season kit. This was white with a red breast, and with thin stripes down either side, and was created to accommodate the logo of the club&#x27;s principal sponsor, Cantor&#x27;s, a local furniture shop. This was to be replaced by a striped kit, with the sponsor Bentley&#x27;s (1981–82) and Renault (1982–83) written vertically down a white stripe over the left-hand side. Their kits continued to feature striped shirts, albeit with various aids to accommodate their sponsors, including a yellow square for Laver from 1988 to 1992 (the 1990–92 shirt also featured narrow black stripes through each white stripe) and a black hoop, also for Laver in the 1994–95 season. Then came the diamond kit, which was so badly received that the club reverted to stripes the following season. Since then, red and white stripes and black socks with varying trim have been the order of the day, with black shorts for all but the 2002–05 seasons, when white and then red were tried. The club also every few seasons opt to put thin black stripes between the red and white stripes. Sheffield United&#x27;s home colours were the inspiration for the kit of Irish club, Derry City. In 1934, Derry City adopted the stripes, while Billy Gillespie was manager of the club, in recognition of Gillespie&#x27;s achievements at Sheffield United.

The first time a crest appeared on the shirt was in the 1891–92 season, when a red crest appeared on the white shirt, but this disappeared the following season. United used the city of Sheffield&#x27;s coat of arms from 1965 to 1977, when a new crest was used, introduced by former manager Jimmy Sirrel, but designed apparently over 20 years previously by former player Jimmy Hagan. This consisted of two white crossed swords, or blades, the club&#x27;s nickname, with a Yorkshire Rose above, on a black background. This is surrounded by a red ring with &quot;Sheffield United F.C.&quot; written around the top and &quot;1889&quot;, the year the club was founded, underneath. This has been altered very slightly a few times, with a simple black embroidered crest appearing on shirts from 1987 to 1990, and an all-white crest on a red-edged black shield for the 1992–99 seasons, but reverted to its original form in 2000.

==Ground==

Sheffield United play at Bramall Lane, near the centre of Sheffield. Bramall Lane is the oldest major league ground anywhere in the world, having hosted its first game in 1862, a match between Hallam and Sheffield Club. Bramall Lane also hosted the world&#x27;s first ever floodlit football match on 14 October 1878 with two teams picked from the Sheffield Football Association. The power for the lights was provided by two generators. The crowd was 20,000 and the score 2–0.

Bramall Lane was originally a cricket ground and in 1855 it was leased to Sheffield United Cricket Club (founded in 1854) by the Duke of Norfolk. The ground was opened with a cricket match on 30 April 1855 and later became a shared cricket/football venue. After Yorkshire County Cricket Club was founded in 1863, it was their main venue in the nineteenth century. They continued to use the ground for some matches each season until 7 August 1973, after which construction work began to convert Bramall Lane into a specialist football stadium.

The ground has seen expansion in recent years, with the 2006 completion of a 3,000 seat corner stand, Bramall Lane is now an all-seater stadium fit for the Premier League holding 31,884.

In March 2009 the club were officially granted permission to expand the stadium once again, over two phases. The first phase would have seen the Kop being extended to increase the ground&#x27;s capacity up to approximately 37,000. It would also have seen the removal of the main supporting pillars and a giant screen installed as part of the stand&#x27;s roof. The second phase would have seen the Valad Stand (formerly Arnold Laver Stand) also extended, bringing the total capacity to a 40,000 all seater. The expansion would also have had a secondary focus of being available for selection for FIFA World Cup matches in 2018 or 2022, if England&#x27;s bid were to be successful. However, on 16 December 2009 The Football Association announced that should England&#x27;s 2018/2022 World Cup bid be successful then any games played in Sheffield would be staged at Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s Hillsborough Stadium. In light of this United&#x27;s former chief executive, Trevor Birch, made it known that all planned ground redevelopment had been put on hold until the club was able to regain and maintain Premiership status.

A revised application for the redevelopment of Kop was submitted in 2015, which would see 3,215 seats added to the stand&#x27;s current capacity. Further plans were revealed in 2017 for the development of the corner between the Kop and South Stand, which would see the construction of residential flats and a new club store.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Sheffield United derive support from a broad cross-section of the city and its environs, with branches of the official supporters&#x27; club running from Swinton, Kiveton Park, Retford, and Eckington. Further afield, supporters groups also exist in Essex, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and Australia, amongst others.

A 2013 study of posts on social networking site Twitter found that Blades fans have the most positive interactions with the official account of their club out of any in English football. Sheffield United were also found to have the most &#x27;obsessed&#x27; fans in the 2006–07 Premier League, with supporters reportedly thinking about the team 110 times a day on average.

United have a number of celebrity supporters including:

* Sean Bean, actor
* Kell Brook, boxer
* Richard Caborn, Labour Party politician
* Joe Elliott, singer-songwriter and musician
* Jessica Ennis-Hill, Olympic gold-medallist
* Flea, singer and actor
* Matt Fitzpatrick, golfer
* Paul Goodison, Olympic gold-medallist

===Rivalries===
Sheffield United have numerous rivalries, mostly with other Yorkshire clubs. The most notable rivalry is with their city neighbours Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City derby (named after the steel industry for which the city of Sheffield is globally famous).

Sheffield United&#x27;s next main regional rival is Leeds United from West Yorkshire. This is known as a Yorkshire derby match (the two cities of Sheffield and Leeds are the largest two cities in Yorkshire). Other local rivalries are shared with the professional clubs of South Yorkshire: Barnsley, Doncaster Rovers and Rotherham United. These matches are known as South Yorkshire derbies.

Sheffield United also have a rivalry with Nottingham Forest. This can be attributed to the miners&#x27; strikes of the 1980s, where workers in the pits of Nottinghamshire did not join the strike (known locally as scabbing) while miners from Yorkshire did.

West Ham United have also become fierce rivals due to the &#x27;Tevez saga&#x27; and the following lawsuit charges.

===Chants===
Like many English clubs, Sheffield United supporters have a wide variety of chants and songs. The most famous of these is &quot;The Greasy Chip Butty Song&quot;, sung to the tune of John Denver&#x27;s &#x27;Annie&#x27;s Song&#x27;.

==Player of the Year==

A &#x27;Player of the Year&#x27; award has been presented since 1967 to recognise the player who has made the greatest contribution to the club over the course of the season. Initially organised by the Official Supporters Club the award was voted for by their members although it was presented as an official club award. In recent years the award has been presented at a gala &#x27;End of Season&#x27; award ceremony and dinner, usually held at the end of April, and voting has been widened to include a broader section of the club&#x27;s fanbase. The first winner of the award was long serving goalkeeper Alan Hodgkinson. The player with the most award wins is striker Alan Woodward on four occasions between 1970 and 1978. The longest gap between wins by a player is seven years; Keith Edwards had two spells with the club and won the award during both, in 1977 and 1984. Harry Maguire and Phil Jagielka have won the award on three consecutive occasions. The award was shared between two players for the first time in 2017, with Billy Sharp and John Fleck receiving the award. The award was won by an overseas born player consecutive times for the first time in 2024, Iliman Ndiaye in 2023 and Gustavo Hamer in 2024.

==Development squads and women&#x27;s team==
=== Academy ===
Sheffield United&#x27;s Academy is responsible for youth development at the club. It has produced such players as Manchester City defender Kyle Walker and defender Phil Jagielka, both England internationals, and also Swansea City defender Kyle Naughton, Burnley full back Matthew Lowton, Manchester United defender and club captain Harry Maguire and current club captain Billy Sharp. The academy building and training facilities in the Sheffield suburb of Shirecliffe were opened in 2002 by then Minister for Sport Richard Caborn. Sheffield United Academy U18s currently play in the Professional Development League at the Shirecliffe ground at Firshill Crescent, and finished as runners-up in the 2011 FA Youth Cup. In addition, SteelPhalt are the sponsor of the Shirecliffe-based Academy, and are also the major sponsor of Sheffield United Women.

=== Under 23s ===
Sheffield United U23s currently compete in the Professional Development League, playing home games at various venues, including Bramall Lane and Stocksbridge Park Steels FC. The club have fielded a reserve team since 1893, when the reserves played in &#x27;Sheffield League Division One&#x27;.

=== United Women ===

Sheffield United also have a Women&#x27;s team, formerly known as Sheffield United Ladies, who play in the FA Women&#x27;s Championship after having been promoted in the 2017–18 season from the FA Women&#x27;s National League. Sheffield United Women also have a Development team and numerous junior teams as part of the Regional Talent Club and an additional grassroots arm.

==Management==

===Coaching staff and support staff===

===Owners, directors and executives===

==Managers==
At its formation in 1889 United did not employ what would today be termed a manager, the side was coached by a trainer and a football committee selected the team and decided upon tactics (this was a continuation of the structure of Sheffield United Cricket Club from which the football team had been formed). They did appoint Joseph Wostinholm to the position of club secretary and he was responsible for the day-to-day running of the club, matchday organisation and dealing with players and contracts. Wostinholm oversaw a period of rapid growth for the team, culminating in 1898 when United won their only First Division championship, after which he retired. Wostinholm was replaced by John Nicholson as secretary and he would remain in post for over thirty years until his death in 1932. Nicholson presided over the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history as United became a leading force in English football, winning the FA Cup four times and regularly challenged at the top of the league but a second Division One title for the club eluded him.

=== A new era ===
Following the death of John Nicholson (who died whilst travelling to an away match in Birmingham) the United board turned to Chesterfield manager Teddy Davison to become the club&#x27;s first real manager. The team were in decline however and were soon relegated for the first time in their history. Davison gradually rebuilt the side with astute signings and young players and regained top flight status, but the club&#x27;s post-war financial problems would hamper team building for years to come. Davison retired in 1952 and prompted the club to appoint Rotherham United manager Reg Freeman as his successor. Freeman stabilised the team but fell ill and died in 1955 after which United turned to the inexperienced Joe Mercer but he struggled to cope with a team in decline and departed for Aston Villa in 1958. United then appointed Chester manager John Harris who inherited a talented but under performing side which he transformed into a promotion team, returning to Division One in 1961. Harris built a side based on local players and stabilised them in the top flight but financial issues soon prompted the sale of key players and United were eventually relegated once more. Harris opted to &#x27;move upstairs&#x27; to become &#x27;general manager&#x27; and handed the role of team manager to Arthur Rowley but he was sacked after one season following disappointing results. Harris returned as manager and guided the side to promotion once more but after a good start back in the top flight Harris&#x27; confidence faded and he stepped down in 1973 to &#x27;move upstairs&#x27; for the second time.

=== Rapid decline ===
Experienced Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy was the man United turned to replace John Harris. He initially did well but the team was ageing and there was little money to replace players. After a good finish in his first season a disastrous string of results the following year led to Furphy&#x27;s sacking in October 1975. Jimmy Sirrel was recruited from Notts County but he proved unpopular with both the players and fans and could not halt the decline, overseeing relegation and then being sacked in September 1977 with United at the bottom of Division Two. The ambitious and colourful Harry Haslam was handed the reins and although many of his ideas were ahead of their time he built an ageing side based on &#x27;star&#x27; players at the end of their career. Now in the Third Division performances deteriorated still further and Haslam stepped down due to illness in January 1981. World Cup winner and then United player Martin Peters was promoted to the position of manager but United were relegated to Division Four at the end of the season and Peters resigned.

=== Moving on up ===
With a new ambitious board in place United recruited Ian Porterfield as manager in June 1981. He had an immediate impact, winning the Division Four championship in his first season and taking the club back into the second tier two years later on a meagre budget. Despite this many fans were unhappy with the style of football and odd team selections and Porterfield was sacked in 1986 following supporter protests. Coach Billy McEwan was promoted to the position of manager but failed to improve the standard of play and with attendances falling and the team in danger of relegation once more he was sacked in January 1988. United now turned to the colourful character of Dave Bassett who had most recently had a short, unsuccessful spell as manager of Watford. It was to prove an astute appointment as although he could not prevent relegation in his first season he built a solid, hard working team on a small budget and won back to back promotions, returning the club to the top flight and achieving regular mid-table finishes. With the formation of the Premier League United&#x27;s old financial problems and willingness to sell star players without replacing them meant the side eventually succumbed to relegation and when an immediate return was not forthcoming Basset was sacked in December 1995.

=== Comings and goings ===
The following years proved a turbulent time for United as they chased the ambition of Premiership football. Experienced Howard Kendall was recruited as manager and undertook a complete rebuilding of the side but left in June 1997 to take over at Everton. Player-coach Nigel Spackman was promoted to replace Kendall but after initial promise he quit after only eight months citing boardroom interference. This was to become a recurring theme and replacement Steve Bruce would leave after only one season citing the same reasons. Adrian Heath then proved a disastrous appointment and lasted only six months before being sacked with United looking more likely to be relegated than promoted. The Blades then turned to experienced lower league manager Neil Warnock who managed to stave off relegation and began to rebuild the side on a meagre budget. Warnock proved a divisive figure with fans, but after a number of mid-table finishes he achieved promotion back to the Premiership in 2006. The side were relegated the following season, prompting the board not to renew Warnock&#x27;s contract.

Just like Adrian Heath, the appointment of Bryan Robson in 2007 proved an unpopular and unsuccessful one and he was sacked after less than a year following poor results and intense fan pressure. Former assistant manager Kevin Blackwell was appointed as Robson&#x27;s replacement but despite reaching the play-off finals in his first full season, the team was in decline and he was sacked after only two games of the 2010–11 season. Worse was to come, however, as player-coach Gary Speed was briefly promoted to manager but left after only a few months to take over the Welsh national side. Micky Adams then became the third full-time manager of the season, overseeing a disastrous run of results which saw United relegated and Adams sacked after only six months in charge.

With United in the third tier once more, Danny Wilson was appointed as manager in June 2011, despite protests from United fans over his previous association with cross-town rivals Sheffield Wednesday. Wilson guided the club to the League One play-off final in his first full season in charge, only to lose to Huddersfield Town after a famous penalty shootout in which Huddersfield missed their first three penalties. Despite the club challenging for promotion the following season, a poor run of results led to Wilson&#x27;s departure in April 2013, being replaced by Chris Morgan until the end of the season.

After a long search for a new boss, former Scotland defender David Weir was appointed as Wilson&#x27;s long-term replacement. Weir&#x27;s tenure was short-lived however, as he was sacked in October of the same year, having won only one of 13 games in charge. After Chris Morgan had overseen the team for a brief time, Nigel Clough was appointed as Weir&#x27;s permanent successor in October 2013. Clough guided the Blades to finish seventh in the table narrowly missing the play-offs after having been bottom of the table at the start of February and also led United to an FA Cup semi-final against Hull City which the Blades lost 5–3 after twice taking the lead in the first half.

The following season saw Clough guide the Blades to fifth place in the league, thus qualifying for the play-offs and also led them to a first League Cup semi-final in 12 years, with the Blades ultimately losing to Tottenham Hotspur 3–2 on aggregate. United failed to gain promotion through the play-offs after losing to Swindon Town 2–1 in the first leg and drawing 5–5 in the second leg (7–6 on aggregate).

Following their failure to gain promotion, Clough was sacked on 25 May 2015 and on 2 June 2015, former Scunthorpe United, Southampton and Reading boss Nigel Adkins was appointed as the new Blades manager. However, his appointment only lasted one season as the Blades (who were in 2nd place after the first five matches) ultimately finished in 11th place, the club&#x27;s lowest finish in the third tier since 1983. Adkins was duly sacked on 12 May 2016.

Atkins was quickly replaced by former Northampton Town manager and former Blades player Chris Wilder, who oversaw United&#x27;s promotion from League One in 2017, after six years in the division, and its subsequent return to the Premier League in 2019.

United went on to finish ninth in their first season back in the top flight, but the following 2020–21 season was a completely different story. On 13 March 2021, Wilder left the club by mutual consent, with the club bottom of the Premier League, with 14 points from 28 games. U23 coach Paul Heckingbottom took interim charge of the team until the end of the season but United were still relegated.

On 27 May 2021, former Fulham boss Slaviša Jokanović was appointed by United on a three-year deal, becoming the club&#x27;s first manager from overseas. However he was sacked on 25 November 2021, after United had only won six of 19 Championship games.

Heckingbottom was subsequently appointed manager of Sheffield United, this time on a permanent basis, and eventually guided United to the FA Cup semi-finals in 2023, and back to the Premier League for the 2023–24 season.

United struggled on their return to the Premier League for the 2023–24 season and by early December the team was bottom of the League. Paul Heckingbottom was sacked and replaced by former Blades manager, Chris Wilder.

Sheffield United&#x27;s in-house media label SUTV broadcast matches available to stream through their website.

United were, along with Arsenal, the first team to be featured in a live radio commentary. The Division One fixture between the two sides on 22 January 1927 was broadcast by the BBC. Club captain Billy Gillespie scored United&#x27;s goal in the 1–1 draw and listeners were provided with a numbered map of the pitch via the Radio Times to aid their understanding of where play was taking place. The area in front of the goalkeeper was numbered 1, with the game providing the first use of the phrase &quot;back to square one.&quot;

A number of films and television programmes have included references to Sheffield United:

* 1977 Sheffield United are referenced by Brian Blessed&#x27;s character in a third series episode of the BBC post-apocalyptic drama series &quot;Survivors&quot; from the 1970s. Blessed&#x27;s character also wears a Sheffield United scarf throughout.
* 1990, the BBC produced a six-part documentary series named &quot;United&quot; that followed the fortunes of the club towards the end of the 1989–90 season, in which they achieved automatic promotion to the top flight of English football.
* 1996 film &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot; stars real-life United fan Sean Bean as a part-time Hallam FC player who is scouted by Sheffield United, who then goes on to play in a FA Cup semi-final.
* 1997 British comedy film &quot;The Full Monty&quot; is set in Sheffield and the character Gaz is seen wearing a replica United shirt at one part of the film, and promises his son a ticket for a game at Bramall Lane between Sheffield United and Manchester United.
* 2004 Walt Disney film &quot;National Treasure&quot; which stars Sean Bean, and Nicolas Cage as the lead character. There is a scene where Bean&#x27;s character is writing on a yellow notepad. Near the top right corner of the notepad is a doodle of the Sheffield United club emblem, the crossed blades and a dot to represent the Yorkshire rose.
* 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins&quot; features a child wearing a 1990s Blades shirt. 
* 2012 television drama &quot;Prisoners&#x27; Wives&quot; also references the club.

==International links==

In January 2006, Sheffield United became the first foreign club to take over a Chinese team when they purchased the football club Chengdu F.C., based in the city of Chengdu, China. The club was renamed the Chengdu Blades, after their new owners. Sheffield United shirts were sold in China, and Chengdu shirts were sold in Sheffield, increasing revenue streams for both clubs. United sold on their share of the Chinese side in 2010, following Chengdu&#x27;s implication in a match-fixing scandal and increasing financial pressures on the English club.

In February 2008, Kevin McCabe, the club&#x27;s chairman, finalised an agreement with Budapest-based Ferencváros to buy its football team, and also negotiated with the Hungarian government to purchase and develop the ground around Stadion Albert Flórián. A match was played in Budapest to celebrate the link-up. McCabe left the Fenecváros board in January 2011.

The Blades also have operating, business and exchange of ideas links with Central Coast Mariners of Australia and White Star Woluwé of Belgium. In November 2020, they took over the Calicut, Kerala based club Quartz FC which plays in the third tier of Indian Football and rebranded it as Kerala United FC.

<text>Wolverhampton Civic Hall is a music venue in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. It has been one of the most notable live music venues in the county for several decades. It is part of a complex branded as University of Wolverhampton at The Halls, Wolverhampton including University of Wolverhampton at The Civic Hall, University of Wolverhampton at Wulfrun Hall and the Slade Rooms (previously known as The Little Civic). The complex is owned by City of Wolverhampton Council, operated by AEG Presents and is a Grade II listed building.

==Construction and development==
The hall, which was designed by Lyons and Israel in the Classical style was completed in May 1938. The smaller Wulfrun Hall had been inspired by the architecture of the Stockholm Concert Hall. It was officially opened by the Earl of Dartmouth on 12 May 1938. Jack Hylton and his orchestra provided the entertainment for the occasion. Queen Elizabeth II visited the Civic Hall and had lunch with civic leaders during a visit to the West Midlands on 24 May 1962.

It was renovated and extended to a design by Penoyre &amp; Prasad in 2001.

The venue was reconfigured to create the new Slade Rooms in March 2010.

City of Wolverhampton Council announced plans for a revamp of the Civic Halls with a budget of £10.4 million in March 2015. The halls closed in December 2015 at which time the cost projection had increased to £14.4 million. In March 2019 it was announced that the halls would not reopen until autumn 2021 and that the cost was projected at £38.1 million.

In November 2021 it was announced that the Civic Halls were now due to reopen in Autumn 2022, which in October 2022 was officially revised to June 2023. The City Council also announced that they had signed a 25-year deal with AEG Presents to manage and promote the venues, which have been expanded to 3,404 in the Civic Hall and 1,289 in the Wulfrun Hall.

The reopening of the place will officially take place in June 2023, with a series of concerts including Siouxsie&#x27;s.

==Organ==
A Compton Organ was specially designed for the Civic Hall. The organ was made up of over 5,500 pipes and contained an early electronic division known as a Melotone. G. D. Cunningham, then Birmingham City Organist, had the distinction of being the first musician to play there to invited guests. The Organ was re-built and enlarged in 2001, and was capable of being played as a concert organ or theatre organ.

In September 2016 it was announced that the organ would be removed and would not return to the Civic Hall. In February 2019 it was revealed that the pipes had been scrapped, despite several offers to restore them, free of charge.

==Events==

The first concert was performed on the evening of 16 May 1938, by the Old Royals Association, with Anne Ziegler, Webster Booth and several other soloists.

Comedians, such as Ken Dodd, Peter Kay and Jim Davidson, have appeared at the hall.

It has also staged some sports events. Throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s professional wrestling was broadcast live from the venue on Saturday afternoons. On 16 March 2006 the venue was first utilized by the Professional Darts Corporation as it hosted Week 4 of the 2006 Premier League Darts. From 2007 the venue has staged the Grand Slam of Darts. However the tournament in 2018 was moved to Aldersley Leisure Village due to on going refurbishments at the Civic Hall. Gary Anderson, having competed every year in tournament since its conception, says he prefers the Civic Hall over the new venue. &quot;The Civic Hall - that was the Grand Slam of Darts.&quot;

There have also been some memorable concerts. The rock band, &quot;The Who&quot;, performed there in January 1969. Morrissey played his first solo performance at the Civic Hall on 22 December 1988. Nirvana performed &quot;All Apologies&quot; for the first time before a live audience at the Wulfrun Hall on 6 November 1991 and Louise Redknapp performed there on the final date of her Soft and Gentle Tour on 18 December 1997.

In 2009, The Specials played a concert at the Civic Hall as part of their 30th anniversary reunion tour; the performance was later released on DVD. More recently, the Welsh rock band, the Manic Street Preachers, gave a concert in June 2015.

It was announced in February 2023, Siouxsie would play her first UK gig after a ten-year absence at the Civic Hall in June 2023.

<text>The Mars Climate Orbiter (formerly the Mars Surveyor &#x27;98 Orbiter) was a robotic space probe launched by NASA on December 11, 1998, to study the Martian climate, Martian atmosphere, and surface changes and to act as the communications relay in the Mars Surveyor &#x27;98 program for Mars Polar Lander. However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was permanently lost as it went into orbital insertion. The spacecraft encountered Mars on a trajectory that brought it too close to the planet, and it was destroyed in the atmosphere. An investigation attributed the failure to a measurement mismatch between two measurement systems: SI units (metric) by NASA and US customary units by spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin.

==Mission background==

===History===
After the loss of &quot;Mars Observer&quot; and the onset of the rising costs associated with the future International Space Station, NASA began seeking less expensive, smaller probes for scientific interplanetary missions. In 1994, the Panel on Small Spacecraft Technology was established to set guidelines for future miniature spacecraft. The panel determined that the new line of miniature spacecraft should be under with highly focused instrumentation. In 1995, a new Mars Surveyor program began as a set of missions designed with limited objectives, low costs, and frequent launches. The first mission in the new program was Mars Global Surveyor, launched in 1996 to map Mars and provide geologic data using instruments intended for &quot;Mars Observer&quot;. Following Mars Global Surveyor, &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; carried two instruments, one originally intended for Mars Observer, to study the climate and weather of Mars.

The primary science objectives of the mission included:
*determine the distribution of water on Mars
*monitor the daily weather and atmospheric conditions
*record changes on the Martian surface due to wind and other atmospheric effects
*determine temperature profiles of the atmosphere
*monitor the water vapor and dust content of the atmosphere
*look for evidence of past climate change.

===Spacecraft design===
The &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; bus measured tall, wide and deep. The internal structure was largely constructed with graphite composite/aluminum honeycomb supports, a design found in many commercial airplanes. With the exception of the scientific instruments, battery and main engine, the spacecraft included dual redundancy on the most important systems. The spacecraft weighed . 

The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized and included eight hydrazine monopropellant thrusters: four thrusters to perform trajectory corrections and four thrusters to control attitude. Orientation of the spacecraft was determined by a star tracker, two Sun sensors and two inertial measurement units. Orientation was controlled by firing the thrusters or using three reaction wheels. To perform the Mars orbital insertion maneuver, the spacecraft also included a LEROS 1B main engine rocket, providing of thrust by burning hydrazine fuel with nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) oxidizer.

The spacecraft included a high-gain antenna to transceive data with the Deep Space Network over the x band. The radio transponder designed for the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission was used as a cost-saving measure. It also included a two-way UHF radio frequency system to relay communications with Mars Polar Lander upon an expected landing on December 3, 1999.

The space probe was powered with a three-panel solar array, providing an average of at Mars. Deployed, the solar array measured in length. Power was stored in 12-cell, 16-amp-hour nickel-hydrogen batteries. The batteries were intended to be recharged when the solar array received sunlight and power the spacecraft as it passed into the shadow of Mars. When entering into orbit around Mars, the solar array was to be utilized in the aerobraking maneuver, to slow the spacecraft until a circular orbit was achieved. The design was largely adapted from guidelines from the Small Spacecraft Technology Initiative outlined in the book, &quot;Technology for Small Spacecraft&quot;.

In an effort to simplify previous implementations of computers on spacecraft, &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; featured a single computer using an IBM RAD6000 processor utilizing a POWER1 ISA capable of 5, 10 or 20 MHz operation. Data storage was to be maintained on 128 MB of random-access memory (RAM) and 18 MB of flash memory. The flash memory was intended to be used for highly important data, including triplicate copies of the flight system software.

==Scientific instruments==
===Pressure Modulated Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR)===

The Pressure Modulated Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR) uses narrow-band radiometric channels and two pressure modulation cells to measure atmospheric and surface emissions in the thermal infrared and a visible channel to measure dust particles and condensates in the atmosphere and on the surface at varying longitudes and seasons. Its principal investigator was Daniel McCleese at JPL/CALTECH. Similar objectives were later achieved with &quot;Mars Climate Sounder&quot; on board &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;. Its objectives:
* Map the three-dimensional and time-varying thermal structure of the atmosphere from the surface to 80 km altitude.
* Map the atmospheric dust loading and its global, vertical and temporal variation.
* Map the seasonal and spatial variation of the vertical distribution of atmospheric water vapor to an altitude of at least 35 km.
* Distinguish between atmospheric condensates and map their spatial and temporal variation.
* Map the seasonal and spatial variability of atmospheric pressure.
* Monitor the polar radiation balance.

=== Mars Color Imager (MARCI)===

The Mars Color Imager (MARCI) is a two-camera (medium-angle/wide-angle) imaging system designed to obtain pictures of the Martian surface and atmosphere. Under proper conditions, resolutions up to are possible. The principal investigator on this project was Michael Malin at Malin Space Science Systems and the project was reincorporated on &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;.

Its objectives:
* Observe Martian atmospheric processes at global scale and synoptically.
* Study details of the interaction of the atmosphere with the surface at a variety of scales in both space and time.
* Examine surface features characteristic of the evolution of the Martian climate over time.

==Mission profile==
===Launch and trajectory===
The &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; probe was launched on December 11, 1998, at 18:45:51 UTC by NASA from Space Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida, aboard a Delta II 7425 launch vehicle. The complete burn sequence lasted 42 minutes bringing the spacecraft into a Hohmann transfer orbit, sending the probe into a 9.5-month, trajectory. At launch, &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; weighed including propellant.

===Encounter with Mars===
&quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; began the planned orbital insertion maneuver on September 23, 1999, at 09:00:46 UTC. &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; went out of radio contact when the spacecraft passed behind Mars at 09:04:52 UTC, 49 seconds earlier than expected, and communication was never reestablished. Due to complications arising from human error, the spacecraft encountered Mars at a lower-than-anticipated altitude and it was either destroyed in the atmosphere or re-entered heliocentric space after leaving Mars&#x27; atmosphere. &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; has since completed most of the intended objectives for this mission.

==Cause of failure==
On November 10, 1999, the &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; Mishap Investigation Board released a Phase I report, detailing the suspected issues encountered with the loss of the spacecraft.

Previously, on September 8, 1999, Trajectory Correction Maneuver-4 (TCM-4) was computed, and was then executed on September 15, 1999. It was intended to place the spacecraft at an optimal position for an orbital insertion maneuver that would bring the spacecraft around Mars at an altitude of on September 23, 1999.

However, during the week between TCM-4 and the orbital insertion maneuver, the navigation team reported that it appeared the insertion altitude could be much lower than planned, at about . Twenty-four hours prior to orbital insertion, calculations placed the orbiter at an altitude of . was the minimum altitude that &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; was thought to be capable of surviving during this maneuver.

During insertion, the orbiter was intended to skim through Mars&#x27; upper atmosphere, gradually aerobraking for weeks, but post-failure calculations showed that the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory would have taken it within of the surface. At this altitude, the spacecraft would likely have skipped violently off the denser-than-expected atmosphere, and it was either destroyed in the atmosphere, or re-entered heliocentric space.

The primary cause of this discrepancy was that one piece of ground software supplied by Lockheed Martin produced results in a United States customary unit, contrary to its Software Interface Specification (SIS), while a second system, supplied by NASA, expected those results to be in SI units, in accordance with the SIS. Specifically, software that calculated the total impulse produced by thruster firings produced results in pound-force seconds. The trajectory calculation software then used these results – expected to be in newton-seconds (incorrect by a factor of 4.45) – to update the predicted position of the spacecraft.

Still, NASA does not place the responsibility on Lockheed for the mission loss; instead, various officials at NASA have stated that NASA itself was at fault for failing to make the appropriate checks and tests that would have caught the discrepancy.

The discrepancy between calculated and measured position, resulting in the discrepancy between desired and actual orbit insertion altitude, had been noticed earlier by at least two navigators, whose concerns were dismissed because they &quot;did not follow the rules about filling out [the] form to document their concerns&quot;. A meeting of trajectory software engineers, trajectory software operators (navigators), propulsion engineers, and managers was convened to consider the possibility of executing Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5, which was in the schedule. Attendees of the meeting recall an agreement to conduct TCM-5, but it was ultimately not done.

The loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter took place two and a half months before the loss of the Mars Polar Lander. Inadequate funding and poor management have been cited as underlying causes of the failures. According to Thomas Young, chairman of the Mars Program Independent Assessment Team, the Mars Surveyor &#x27;98 program &quot;was under funded by at least 30%.&quot;

=== Project costs ===
According to NASA, the cost of the mission was $327.6 million ($ million in ) total for the orbiter and lander, comprising $193.1 million ($ million in ) for spacecraft development, $91.7 million ($ million in ) for launching it, and $42.8 million ($ million in ) for mission operations.

<text>John Cosin (30 November 1594 – 15 January 1672) was an English bishop.

==Life==
He was born at Norwich, and was educated at Norwich School and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he was scholar and afterwards fellow. On taking orders he was appointed secretary to John Overall, Bishop of Lichfield, and then domestic chaplain to Richard Neile, Bishop of Durham. In December 1624 he was made a prebendary of Durham, and on 9 September 1625 Archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire (until 1660).

In 1630 he received his degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD). He first became known as an author in 1627, when he published his &quot;Collection of Private Devotions&quot;, a manual stated to have been prepared by command of King Charles I, for the use of Queen Henrietta Maria&#x27;s maids of honour. This book, together with his insistence on points of ritual in his cathedral church and his friendship with William Laud, exposed Cosin to the hostility of the Puritans; and the book was criticised by William Prynne and Henry Burton. In 1628 Cosin took part in the prosecution of a brother prebendary, Peter Smart, for a sermon against high church practices; and the prebendary was deprived.

On 8 February 1635 Cosin was appointed master of Peterhouse, Cambridge; and in 1640 he became vice-chancellor of the university. In October of this year he was promoted to the deanery of Peterborough. A few days before his installation the Long Parliament had met; and among the complainants who hastened to appeal to it for redress was the ex-prebendary, Smart. His petition against the new dean was considered; and early in 1641 Cosin was sequestered from his benefices. Articles of impeachment were presented against him two months later, but he was dismissed on bail. For sending the university plate to the king, he was deprived of the mastership of Peterhouse (13 March 1643). He went to France, preached at Paris, and served as chaplain to some members of the household of the exiled royal family. At the Restoration he returned to England, was reinstated in the mastership (3 August 1660), restored to all his benefices, and in a few months raised to the see of Durham – he therefore resigned from the Mastership of Peterhouse on 18 October 1660.

Cosin noted that Auckland Castle in the town of Bishop Auckland was empty and that its chapel was in ruin; he went on to improve the property, renovating the Great Hall and converting it into a new chapel that still stands today.

He was elected to that See on 5 November, which election was confirmed on 22 November; he was duly consecrated a bishop on 2 December and enthroned on 8 December 1660.

Cosin was responsible for a style of church woodwork unique to County Durham, a sumptuous fusion of gothic and contemporary Jacobean forms. The font cover in Durham Cathedral is a splendid example of this, as are the displays in the churches at Sedgefield and elsewhere. The Cosin woodwork at Brancepeth has sadly been destroyed by fire.

At the convocation in 1661 Cosin played a prominent part in the revision of the Book of Common Prayer, and endeavoured with some success to bring both prayers and rubrics into better agreement with ancient liturgies. Ultimately, his efforts produced the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, established as the authorized liturgical book of the Church of England by the Act of Uniformity 1662. He administered his diocese successfully for eleven years; and used a large share of his revenues to promote the interests of the Church, of schools and of charitable institutions.

He died in London in 1672. He had married Frances (d. 25 March 1642), the daughter of Marmaduke Blakiston on 15 August 1626 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Durham.

==Attitudes==
Though a classical high churchman and a rigorous enforcer of outward conformity, Cosin was uncompromisingly hostile to Roman Catholicism, and most of his writings illustrate this antagonism. In France he was on friendly terms with Huguenots, justifying himself on the ground that their non-episcopal ordination had not been of their own seeking, and at the Savoy conference in 1661 he tried hard to effect a reconciliation with the Presbyterians. He differed from the majority of his colleagues in his strict attitude towards Sunday observance and in favouring, in the case of adultery, both divorce and the remarriage of the innocent party.

On a theological point of view, Cosin is considered to be an Arminian anti-Calvinist. In particular, his book of devotions is considered by historians as Arminian and imbued with sacramentalism.

==Writings==

Among his writings (most of which were published posthumously) are a &quot;Historia Transubstantiationis Papalis&quot; (1675), &quot;Notes and Collections on the Book of Common Prayer&quot; (1710) and &quot;A Scholastical History of the Canon of Holy Scripture&quot; (1657). A collected edition of his works, forming 5 vols of the Oxford &quot;Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology&quot;, was published between 1843 and 1855; and his &quot;Correspondence&quot; (2 vols) was edited by George Ornsby for the Surtees Society (1868–1870).

Among his notable work was the translation of &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot; included in the 1662 revision of the Book of Common Prayer; written for the Coronation of King Charles I of Great Britain, and sung at every coronation since that time.


==Library==

In 1669 Cosin founded one of the earliest public libraries to give local people access to ‘good books.’ A history of the collection of Cosin&#x27;s books still in the library notes that it is &quot;one of the most important British centres for the study of older books.&quot;

<text>The paradise garden is a form of garden of Old Iranian origin, specifically Achaemenid which is formal, symmetrical and most often, enclosed. The most traditional form is a rectangular garden split into four quarters with a pond in the center, a four-fold design called &quot;chahar bagh&quot; (“four gardens”). One of the most important elements of paradise gardens is water, with ponds, canals, rills, and fountains all being common features. Scent is an essential element with fruit-bearing trees and flowers selected for their fragrance.

It is also often referred to as an Islamic garden. The form of garden spread throughout Egypt and the Mediterranean during the Muslim Arabic conquests, reaching as far as India and Spain.

==Etymology==
Originally denominated by a single noun denoting &quot;a walled-in compound or garden&quot;, from &quot;pairi&quot; (&quot;around&quot;) and &quot;&quot;daeza&quot; or &quot;diz&quot;&quot; (&quot;wall&quot;, &quot;brick&quot;, or &quot;shape&quot;), philosopher and historian Xenophon of Athens borrowed the Old Iranian &quot;*paridaiza(h)&quot;, Late Old Iranian &quot;*pardēz&quot; (Avestan &quot;pairidaēza&quot;, Old Persian &quot;*paridaida&quot;, Late Old Persian &quot;pardēd&quot;) into Greek as &quot;paradeisos&quot;. This term is used for the Garden of Eden in Greek translations of the Old Testament.

In Persian, the word &quot;pardis&quot; means both paradise and garden.

==History==
The oldest Persian garden of which there are records belonged to Cyrus the Great, in his capital at Pasargadae in the province of Fars to the north of Shiraz. It is the oldest intact layout that suggests elements of the paradise garden. Likely planted with cypress, pomegranate and cherry, the garden had a geometrical plan and stone watercourses. These watercourses formed the principal axis and secondary axes of the main garden at Pasargadae, prefiguring the four-fold design of the &quot;chahar bagh&quot;. In the Achaemenid Empire, gardens contained fruit trees and flowers, including the lily and rose. In 330 BC Alexander the Great saw the tomb of Cyrus the Great and recorded that it stood in an irrigated grove of trees.

It is believed that the Achaemenid kings built paradise gardens within enclosed royal hunting parks, a tradition inherited from the Assyrians, for whom the ritual lion hunt was a rite that authenticated kingship. The Assyrians in turn had inherited their landscaping techniques from the Babylonians.

In the 5th century, at the time of the invasion of Persia by Cyrus the Younger, Xenophon described a complex of palaces and pavilions belonging to Artaxerxes. This included gardens watered by an aqueduct – the earliest known record of gravity-fed water rills and basins arranged in a geometric system. The Spartan General Lysander who joined Cyrus as a mercenary reported to Xenophon how Persian kings &quot;excelled in not only in war but also in gardening, creating &quot;paradeisos&quot;&quot; where they collected plants, especially fruit-bearing trees and animals encountered during foreign campaigns.

The four-fold layout was later reinterpreted in Islamic terms by Muslim Arabs after the 7th-century conquest of Persia, becoming associated with the Abrahamic concept of paradise and the Garden of Eden. Genesis 2:10 reads, &quot;And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.&quot; and Muhammad spoke of four rivers: of water, milk, wine and honey.

By the 13th century the gardens had spread with Islam throughout Egypt, Mediterranean north Africa and into Spain. This style of garden came into India during the 16th century in the reign of Prince Babur, the first Emperor of the Mughal Empire. Most Mughal gardens came to have a tomb or pavilion in the centre, the most famous of which is the Taj Mahal although with the decline of the Mughal Empire and British colonial rule, the original garden has been substantially changed.

==Features==
The essential plan of a paradise garden is a four-fold layout (&quot;charbagh&quot;) with a pond or fountain in the centre. Later designs incorporated a pavilion or mausoleum when they began to develop into elaborate status symbols. The rectangular or rectilinear design is typically quartered by water channels made using the ancient qanat system.

An important and common feature is the elaborate use of water, often in canals, ponds, or rills, sometimes in fountains, and less often in waterfalls. This created the soothing sound of running water and also had the practical purpose of cooling the air.

Aromatic flowers and fruit-bearing trees are quintessential elements. The ground where the flora were planted was sunken or the walkways raised so that passers-by would be able to easily pluck fresh fruit as they walked throughout the garden. Olive, fig, date and pomegranate were ubiquitous and symbolically important. Orange trees arrived from India via the Silk Road by the 11th century and were incorporated for their fragrance and the beauty of their flowers.

They are typically enclosed by high walls providing shade and protection, especially desirable in the harsh, arid climate where this type of garden flourished.

==Interpretation==
Much of the use and symbolism of the paradise garden is thought to have derived from the Garden of Eden, despite most elements of the design predating the Abrahamic religions. In the Book of Genesis, the Garden of Eden is described as having a design similar to the four-fold design, with a central spring that feeds four rivers, each flowing out into the world beyond. In the Quran, the Jannah is described as being abundant with material delights including delicious foods and constantly flowing water.

Having emerged in the desert, the thirst and gratitude for water are abundant in Islamic traditions. In the Quran, rivers are the primary constituents of the paradise, and references to rain and fountains abound. In the Quran 21:30: &quot;Did the disbelievers not observe that the heavens and the earth were closed, then We opened them? And We created from water every living thing. Would they still not believe?&#x27;.&quot; Water is associated with the virtues of purity and obedience: &quot;Then the water was told, &#x27;Be still&#x27;. And it was still, awaiting God&#x27;s command. This is implied water, which contains neither impurity nor foam&quot; (Tales of the Prophets, al-Kisa&#x27;).

Although the concept of &quot;chahar bagh&quot; gardens representing &#x27;paradise on earth&#x27; predates the Islamic adoption of the style, the paradisical retreats of the Persians became known as &quot;the embodiment of the celestial paradise promised to a practicing Muslim&quot;. Gardens representing paradise on earth or paradise gardens spread throughout the Muslim-conquered world and developed into different, grander and more elaborate styles.

==Influence==
The paradise garden is one of the few original and fundamental kinds of garden from which all gardens in history derive, sometimes in combinations. In its simplest form, the paradise garden consists of a formal, rectangular pool, having a flow just sufficient to give it movement, and a dais from which to observe it. However, a pavilion provides more permanent shelter than the original tent. Strictly aligned, formally arranged trees, especially the &quot;chenar&quot; or &quot;Platanus&quot;, provide shade.

An example of this style are the Bahá&#x27;í Terraces and Mansion of Bahjí on Mount Carmel in Israel, both of which have extensive gardens of intricate design.

==Examples==
* Pasargadae
* Bagh-e Doulatabad in Yazd, created in the 18th century by the governor Mohammad Taqi Khan
* Cheshmeh-e&#x27;Ali
* Gardens of the Taj Mahal
* Al-Azhar Park, a modern interpretation located in Cairo, Egypt

<text>Richard Neile (or Neale; 1562 – 31 October 1640) was an English churchman, bishop successively of six English dioceses, more than any other man, including the Archdiocese of York from 1631 until his death. 

==Early life==
Neile was born in Westminster, and baptised on 11 March 1562 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster.

He was son of a tallow-chandler, though his grandfather had been a courtier and official under Henry VIII, until he was deprived for non-compliance with the Six Articles. He was educated at Westminster School, under Edward Grant and William Camden. He was sent by Mildred, Lady Burghley (wife of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley), on the recommendation of Gabriel Goodman to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge as a pensioner, matriculating at Easter 1580, graduating B.A. 1584, M.A. 1587, B.D. 1595, D.D. 1600.

Ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough in 1589, he continued to enjoy the patronage of the Burghley family, residing in their household, and became chaplain to Lord Burghley, and later to his son Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury.

He preached before Queen Elizabeth, and became vicar of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire (1590) and rector of Toddington, Bedfordshire (1598). He was appointed Master of the Savoy in 1602, and in July 1603 Clerk of the Closet, a position he would hold until 1632. On 5 November 1605 he was installed Dean of Westminster, resigning the deanery in 1610.

==Bishop==
He held successively the bishoprics of Rochester (1608), Lichfield and Coventry (1610), Lincoln (1614), Durham (1617), and Winchester (1628), and the archbishopric of York (1631).

While at Rochester he appointed William Laud as his chaplain and gave him several valuable preferments. His political activity while bishop of Durham was rewarded with a privy councillorship in 1627. Neile sat regularly in the courts of Star Chamber and High Commission. His correspondence with Laud and with Sir Dudley Carleton and Sir Francis Windebank (Charles I&#x27;s secretaries of state) are valuable sources for the history of the time. He was involved in the last burning at the stake for heresy in England, that of the Arian Edward Wightman in 1612.

Oliver Cromwell made only one speech during his first stint as a Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in the Parliament of 1628–1629, a poorly received attack against Neile, possibly over disagreement with his form of Arminianism.

==Family==
Neile was the father of Sir Paul Neile, astronomer and politician, and grandfather of William Neile, mathematician. His brother, another William Neile (1560–1624), was a book-collector who left 880 books to his children at his death.

<doc id="314943" wikidata="Q3374101" url="?curid=314943" title="Pedro Navaja">
<text>&quot;Pedro Navaja&quot; () is a salsa song written and performed by Rubén Blades from the 1978 collaboration with Willie Colón, &quot;Siembra&quot;, about a criminal of the same name. &quot;Navaja&quot; means &quot;folding knife&quot; in Spanish. Inspired by the song &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, it tells the story of a panderer&#x27;s life and presumed death. The song is recognized throughout Hispanic America, as it retells scenes and stories common to these countries, although the story takes place in New York City. The song deals with life, death and the unexpected with dark humor.

A film titled &quot;Pedro Navaja&quot; based on the song was filmed in Mexico in 1984, starring Andrés García as the title character, Maribel Guardia as his girlfriend, and Resortes as his best friend. It was made without Blades&#x27;s input and he responded by recording the song &quot;Sorpresas&quot; (Surprises), which continues the story, turning the movie plot by revealing that Navaja was alive and had killed another panderer while he was being searched by the panderer, provided that the other panderer believed Navaja was dead. The 1984 film had a 1986 sequel, &quot;El Hijo de Pedro Navaja&quot; (&quot;The Son of Pedro Navaja&quot;) starring Guillermo Capetillo. The story is believed to take place in the New York neighborhood of Queens.

The musical &quot;La verdadera historia de Pedro Navaja&quot; is based on John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera.&quot; The book and lyrics are by Pablo Cabrera, and music is by Pedro Rivera Toledo. It was first produced by Teatro del Sesenta in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1980 at the Teatro Sylvia Rexach; toured to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and, opened the Joseph Papp&#x27;s Latino Festivals of 1985 and 1986, where José Félix Gómez and Idalia Pérez Garay played the title role with Darysabel Isales playing &quot;Doña Pura Buenaventura&quot;; it was also produced by the Teatro Musical de La Habana, Cuba; produced by the Compañía de Teatro Nacional de Venezuela (1986 &amp; 1991); Lolyn Paz produced it three times: in Caguas, Puerto Rico (2003), with Yolandita Monge in the lead female part, San Juan, Puerto Rico (2004), and Fort Lauderdale, Florida (2004); Lima, Peru, starring, among others, Camila Mac Lennan. In 2019 it was staged in Miami with Beatriz Valdés and Manolo Ramos in the lead parts.

== Storyline ==
The lyrics of the song by Blades describe the namesake of the song as he walks down an unnamed avenue in New York City, explicitly mentioning how Navaja dresses, what kind of shoes and hat he wears, his dark glasses (worn so that no one can tell what he is looking at), his shiny gold tooth, and how he always hides his hands in his coat pockets so that &quot;no one can tell in which hands he holds his knife.&quot; At the same time, the song notes and also describes a tired streetwalker who is walking the same street about three blocks from Navaja. An unmarked police car slowly cruises down the avenue, and the prostitute steps into an alley to have a drink - it is a slow day and she has not had any clients.

Navaja looks around the empty avenue, when suddenly the woman comes out of the alley and he sees her. He tightens his grip on the knife and silently runs across the street. Meanwhile, the prostitute takes a gun out of her coat pocket and is about to put it in her purse, so that it stops &quot;bothering&quot; her, when Navaja attacks her with the knife, laughing and the gold tooth &quot;lighting up the avenue&quot; as he plunges the weapon into her. Suddenly a shot rings out from a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 Special (&quot;Smith y Wesson del especial&quot;&quot;) and Navaja falls to the ground while the mortally wounded woman taunts him verbally as she also falls to the ground.

A drunken man stumbles upon the two dead bodies, picks up the gun, the knife, and two dollars and saunters away singing off-key about the &quot;surprises that life throws at you.&quot;

==Reception==
On the review of the album &quot;Siembra&quot;, John Bush of Allmusic referred the message as &quot;a devastating life-in-el-Barrio exposé&quot;.

<text>Sir Francis Windebank (1582 – 1 September 1646) was an English politician who was Secretary of State under Charles I.

==Biography==
Francis was the only son of Sir Thomas Windebank of Hougham, Lincolnshire, who owed his advancement to the Cecil family, Francis entered St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, in 1599, coming there under the influence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud. After a few years of continental travel (1605–1608), he settled at Haines Hill at Hurst in Berkshire and was employed for many years in minor public offices, eventually becoming clerk of the council.

In June 1632, he was appointed by King Charles I as Secretary of State in succession to Lord Dorchester, his senior colleague being Sir John Coke, and he was knighted. His appointment was mainly due to his Spanish and Roman Catholic sympathies. The first Earl of Portland, Francis, Lord Cottington, and Windebank formed an inner group in the council, and with their aid the king carried on various secret negotiations, especially with Spain.

In December 1634 Windebank was appointed to discuss with the papal agent Gregorio Panzani the possibility of a union between the Anglican and Roman Churches, and expressed the opinion that the Puritan opposition might be crippled by sending their leaders to the war in the Netherlands.

Windebank&#x27;s efforts as treasury commissioner in 1635 to shield some of those guilty of corruption led to a breach with Archbishop Laud. In the same year Windebank was one of the promoters of the Courteen association, and the next year he was for a time disgraced for issuing an order for the conveyance of Spanish money to pay the Spanish troops in the Netherlands.

In July 1638 he urged the king to make war with the Scots, and in 1640, when trouble was breaking out in England, he sent an appeal from Queen Henrietta Maria to the pope for money and men. He was elected in March 1640 to the Short Parliament, as member for Oxford University, and he entered the Long Parliament in October as member for Corfe Castle. In December the House learnt that he had signed letters of grace to recusant priests and Jesuits, and summoned him to answer the charge, but the king allowed him to escape to France. From Calais, he wrote to Christopher Hatton, defending his integrity, and affirming his belief that the Church of England was the purest and nearest the primitive Church. He remained in Paris until his death, shortly after he had been received into the Roman communion.

==Family==
Windebank married and had a large family. William Laud referred in 1630 to his &quot;many sons&quot;. He had five at least, and four survived him:
# Thomas (born c. 1612), was M.P. for Wootton Bassett and supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. He was made a baronet in 1645. He was Clerk of the Signet from 1641 until 1645 and again (after the Interregnum) from 1660 to 1674.
# Francis (died 1645), supported the Royalist cause during the English Civil War. He was court-martialled and shot for failing to defend Bletchingdon House, near Oxford.
# Christopher (born 1615), was an Englishman who lived in Madrid and worked as guide and interpreter for English ambassadors.
# John (1618–1704), a physician who was admitted an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1680 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Of Windebank&#x27;s daughters:
*Margaret married Thomas Turner (1591–1672), and was mother of Thomas Turner (1645–1714), president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and of Francis Turner, bishop of Ely, one of the seven Bishops who, refusing to accept James II&#x27;s Declaration of Indulgence, were imprisoned in the Tower of London.
*Frances married Sir Edward Hales on 12 July 1669. 
*One other died unmarried at Paris about 1650.
*Two others became nuns of the Calvary at the Église Sainte-Marie-des-Anges, Paris.

<doc id="314947" wikidata="Q1494126" url="?curid=314947" title="Gardiner Expressway">
<text>The Frederick G. Gardiner Expressway, commonly known as the Gardiner Expressway or simply the Gardiner, is a partially at grade and elevated municipal expressway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Running close to the shore of Lake Ontario, it extends from the foot of the Don Valley Parkway (DVP) in the east, just past the mouth of the Don River, to the junction of Highway 427 and the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) in the west, for a total length of . East of Dufferin Street to just east of the Don River, the roadway is elevated for a length of , unofficially making it the longest bridge in Ontario. 

The Gardiner is named after the first chair of the now-defunct Metro Council, Frederick G. Gardiner. The six-lane section east of the Humber River was built in segments from 1955 until 1964 by the Metropolitan Toronto government with provincial highway funds, and upon completion the Gardiner also received the Highway 2 provincial route numbering until 1998. The ten-lane section west of the Humber was formerly the eastern-most section of the QEW until it was transferred to Metro Toronto in 1997. 

Often described as &quot;an out-of-date, crumbling and frequently traffic-jammed freeway&quot;, the Gardiner is now the focus of a major rehabilitation project that is expected to last at least until 2030. The condition of the elevated section has deteriorated over the years, necessitating much of its replacement. Parts of the expressway have been demolished or re-designed. A section east of the Don River was demolished in 2001, while in 2018, the off-ramp to York/Bay/Yonge Streets was replaced by an off-ramp to Lower Simcoe Street, and the eastern terminus to Lake Shore Boulevard was demolished the following year.

In November 2023, the municipal and provincial governments announced a tentative deal which will see responsibility for the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway transferred to the provincial government, with the two highways to be maintained as provincial highways.

==Route description==

From the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) and Highway 427 interchange, east to the Humber River, the Gardiner is straight, eight-to-ten lanes wide. A continuation of the QEW, municipal control of the freeway starts shortly after an onramp from Highway 427. Due to its status as a former Ontario 400-series highway when it was previously the eastern segment of the QEW, and because of its more recent design (rebuilt in the late 1960s), this section was built to higher standards than the Metro-constructed Gardiner and has a speed limit of 100 km/h. A system of collector and express lanes serves the Parclo interchanges with Kipling Avenue and Islington Avenue, and as the eastbound collector lanes merge into the express lanes approaching the Royal York Road overpass this also marks the start of the lengthy off-ramp to Park Lawn Road. From Highway 427 to Grand Avenue the highway passes through an area of residential, commercial and light industry. To the south are the neighbourhoods of Alderwood and Mimico. After the 1997 provincial downloading to Metro (which became the &quot;Megacity&quot; of Toronto in 1998), much of this former QEW has remained largely unchanged though some segments have received a mix of high mast and low masts with shaded high pressure sodium lamps (similar to the Don Valley Parkway), while the old steel guardrail in the median was replaced by an Ontario &quot;tall-wall&quot; concrete barrier in 2007. Worn-out bilingual provincial signage has received unilingual replacements, while billboards which the province had long prohibited have been erected in proximity of the now-municipal freeway.

East of Grand Avenue, the freeway crosses Park Lawn Road and a CN rail line, then it curves as it passes the residential condominium towers of The Queensway – Humber Bay neighbourhood along the waterfront, the Mr. Christie cookie factory (which later became a part of Mondelēz International) and the Ontario Food Terminal on the north side. Two eastbound lanes exit to Lake Shore Boulevard as the eastbound carriageway narrows to three lanes, followed shortly by an onramp from Lake Shore Boulevard (which was also the point where the Gardiner previously assumed the provincial Highway 2 concurrency from Lake Shore Boulevard, until 1998 when the province downloaded most of Highway 2 which left both Lake Shore Boulevard and the Gardiner without a provincial route number). The westbound carriageway widens to four lanes thanks to the onramp from Lake Shore Boulevard becoming a continuous lane. As the route meets the west bank of the Humber River this marks the QEW&#x27;s old eastern terminus and the beginning of the Metro Toronto-built segment. This old demarcation line was quite visible on the highway as a change in pavement quality and the use of different guardrail and lighting (since the late 1960s the province used truss poles originally fitted with mercury halide lamps before being replaced by high-pressure sodium in the 1990s, while Metro installed distinctive cobra-neck 30-foot (9.1 m) poles with fluorescent tubes that were since swapped for orange low-pressure sodium lamps in 1978). 

East of Brookers Lane, the route geometry of Lake Shore becomes complicated due to the interchange with the parallel Gardiner Expressway; as the two routes run right next to each other to the north near the Humber River crossing: The westbound lanes cross the Gardiner (running along the north side of it) and are intertwined with the ramp from the westbound expressway which meets the street opposite Brookers Lane after crossing back to the south side; although Lake Shore still has an overlapping two-way section east of this point entirely south of the Gardiner. The Lake Shore streetcar line runs along this segment for a short distance before leaving the street to enter Humber Loop via a short tunnel under the Gardiner. Lake Shore then briefly downgrades to a two-lane local street and then becomes one lane (and one way) eastbound as it merges with the eastbound offramp from the Gardiner (which provides the large majority of the traffic along Lake Shore east of this point). on the Humber River bridge.

East of the Humber River bridges the speed limit lowers to 90 km/h as the Gardiner curves along Humber Bay, passing to the south of the Swansea neighbourhood, before passing the Sunnyside waterfront on the south and High Park and the Roncesvalles neighbourhood on the north side. Along the north side from Roncesvalles to Exhibition Place is the neighbourhood of Parkdale. Like the rail lines which run parallel to the Gardiner along its north side, the Gardiner is built in a cut from Dowling Avenue to Dufferin Street and is below grade. From Dufferin to Strachan Avenue, the highway is flanked by light industry and a wall of residential towers in the Liberty Village neighbourhood to the north and the buildings of Exhibition Place on the south side. The highway becomes elevated at this point, rising at a gentle grade with a view of the Toronto skyline straight ahead.

From east of the Exhibition Place streetcar loop and just west of Strachan Avenue, the space below the elevated sections of the highway was enclosed for use as storage space. Bricked sections with windows can be seen when driving along Manitoba Drive or taking the streetcar in or out of Exhibition Place. GO Transit&#x27;s Exhibition train station is located under the Gardiner Expressway with tracks located on the north side of the Gardiner.
To the east of Strachan Avenue, the highway is entirely elevated mostly overhead of Lake Shore Boulevard. Just east of Strachan, the highway passes historic Fort York on the north side and Coronation Park to the south. From Bathurst Street eastward to Spadina Avenue, it passes through CityPlace and immediately after passes south of the CN Tower and the Rogers Centre and north of the residential condominiums of the western end of the Harbourfront neighbourhood. Between York and Yonge Streets, the highway is flanked by the downtown skyscrapers of the South Core and eastern Harbourfront area, and passes the Scotiabank Arena. North along Bay Street are the office towers of the Toronto Financial District. From Yonge east to the Don Valley Parkway, the rail lines run parallel to the Gardiner on the north side, and to the north of the rail lines is the low-rise residential development of the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, the Distillery District and the West Don Lands. To the south of the highway, the land use is light industrial and waterfront lands in transition. The highway crosses the Don River where there are connecting ramps to the Don Valley Parkway. From 2002 to September 2021, the highway&#x27;s elevated section descends to ground level via the Logan Avenue Ramp where it merges with Lake Shore Boulevard before a signalized intersection with Bouchette Street. Due to the ongoing realigment of the highway&#x27;s eastern end as of September 2021, with the demolition of the Don River crossing and Logan Avenue Ramp, traffic defaults to the Don Valley Parkway ramp. 

The elevated section is supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes up and over the westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. A tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades is installed in the median of the elevated segment. The blades act to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between westbound and eastbound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.

===The Bentway===

A public trail and activity space was built underneath the Gardiner, between Strachan and Spadina Avenue. Named after the Gardiner&#x27;s main supports (bents), The Bentway uses bents to create 55 separate areas for a variety of activities. The first phase of the project was completed on January 6, 2018.

===Lighting===
The Gardiner, along with the Don Valley Parkway and Allen Road, were fitted with distinct cobra-neck lamp poles. They were first fitted with fluorescent tubes in the 1960s, which was changed to the orange low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps (LPS) in 1978. (A 1960s experiment of installing lights on the elevated Gardiner&#x27;s parapets was quickly shelved.) In the late 1990s, the low pressure sodium lighting was failing and most of the cobra-neck conventional poles were replaced in favour of shaded high-mast lighting, with high-pressure sodium-vapor lamps (HPS); however the elevated Gardiner still retained the LPS cobra-neck poles for seven more years, while the section immediately west of Dufferin Street still contains several with HPS lamps. The last remaining LPS lamps, which were no longer being produced, were all replaced by HPS in early 2006.

Since the end of 2003, the conventional truss lighting poles that the province installed on the QEW segment in the late 1960s have been removed west of Kipling Avenue and east of Royal York Road, being replaced with shaded high-mast lighting like that used on the Don Valley Parkway.

===Safety===
On August 11, 1958, three days after the road opened, the Gardiner Expressway&#x27;s first collision happened.

The expressway has 28 cameras that are part of the Road Emergency Services Communications Unit system (found also on the Don Valley Parkway and Allen Road). Locations with two cameras have one on the elevated portion and one on the underside along Lake Shore Boulevard. Some cameras are off the Gardiner on Lake Shore Boulevard.

Multi piece vertical blade delineators have been installed upon portions of the concrete median barriers separating the east and westbound lanes.

==History==
===Planning===

The Gardiner Expressway was one of the first projects undertaken by the newly formed government of Metro Toronto. The route of the Expressway necessitated the paving over of parkland, demolition of residences and a popular amusement park, and a long elevated section to get through the downtown area. Planning was done stage-by-stage, from the Humber River east through downtown. The Humber Bay section was built according to initial plans. The route in the Exhibition Place area changed over time from one along the lake shore into downtown, to one aligned along the railway north of Exhibition Place. The initial route east of Exhibition Place would have necessitated the moving or removal of Old Fort York, but was moved to a more southerly alignment after protest. The elevated section through downtown was then aligned over the existing Lake Shore Boulevard in the area. East of downtown, the initial plans were for a ground-level route east to Woodbine, but this was changed in conjunction with the planning of the interchange of the Don Valley Parkway into downtown from the north to an elevated section east to Leslie Street. Various routes to the east were proposed, but never progressed beyond planning studies due to public protest.

Plans for the highway, first named the Lakeshore Expressway, were first developed prior to the formation of Metro Toronto. In the post-war period, the population of greater Toronto was growing at a rate of 50,000 persons per year, the ownership of private automobiles was growing, and the traffic between downtown Toronto and the western suburbs was regularly stuck in &#x27;traffic jams.&#x27; (The Sunnyside stretch of the Lake Shore Boulevard and Queen and King Streets in the Parkdale and High Park areas were apparently notorious for this.) Another reason for the proposal to build the lake shore highway was the expected opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the need for adequate roadways to serve the expanded port facilities.

In May 1947, the Toronto City Planning Board proposed building a four-lane &quot;Waterfront Highway&quot; from the Humber to the Don River. In November 1947, the City&#x27;s works committee approved a four-lane highway, following a path beside the rail lines along the north of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) grounds, ending at Fleet Street to the East at a cost of , to be approved by a plebiscite. The Toronto Board of Control approved the plan, but City Council voted against the plan after 11 hours of deliberation, sending it back to the Board of Control. In December 1947, the Board of Control abandoned the plan, on advice that the bridges for the highway would not be built due to a shortage of steel.

By 1952, the lake shore highway plan cost had escalated to an estimated $30 million. Toronto&#x27;s Mayor Allan A. Lamport objected to the cost being borne solely by the City of Toronto. Lamport suggested that the road could be built either as a toll road or built by private interests. A toll road was opposed by the Ontario Deputy Minister of Highways J. D. Millar, who suggested that &quot;cars would be waiting for miles&quot; to pay a three-cent tax. Millar stated that &quot;the Ontario driver was taxed and taxed heavily and expected his roads will be paid for.&quot; Toronto at the time was not yet planning to fully build the highway, only planning to build a new Humber bridge to connect the Queen Elizabeth Way and expand roads in the Sunnyside area, of which the city would pay and the province $4.7 million. At the same time Ontario was planning its Toronto Bypass north of the city and George Doucett, the Ontario minister of highways, pronounced the toll highway an &quot;antiquated concept&quot; and predicted that no-one would use it if it was tolled and instead would use the bypass instead. H. M. Bishop of the Ontario Motor League also criticized the toll highway saying if it was tolled it would &quot;hardly see a car all day long. The net result would be to increase, not decrease, congestion on city streets.&quot; Toronto Board of Control abandoned the project in July 1952, stating that it would need additional funds not forthcoming from the Ontario government.

In July 1953, prior to the formation of Metro Toronto, the Metropolitan Executive Committee, chaired by Fred Gardiner, ordered the planning of the Lakeshore Expressway as a four-lane or six-lane expressway from the Humber in the west to Woodbine Avenue in the east. The cost was estimated at . Route planning was given to the engineering firm Margison Babcock and Associates, with the proviso that an American firm expert in expressway building would be involved. Margison&#x27;s plan was delivered in April 1954. The roadway was to be constructed in the Sunnyside area and CNE grounds to the south of the present Lake Shore Boulevard. South of the CNE grounds, the route would be on lands created from infilling of the shoreline to the breakwaters and an interchange was proposed in front of the Prince&#x27;s Gate. East of the CNE grounds, the highway would be an elevated roadway above the existing Fleet Street, to just west of the Don River. The highway proceeded at grade from that point eastward, ending at Coxwell Avenue and Queen Street East. Interchanges were proposed for Jameson Avenue, Strachan Avenue, Spadina Avenue, York Street, Jarvis Street, Don Roadway, Carlaw Avenue, Keating Avenue (the present Lake Shore Boulevard East) and Coxwell Avenue. The cost was then estimated at $50 million. The plan also proposed extending Queen Street westwards through High Park to west of the Humber River to connect with the Queensway and extending Keating Avenue east to Woodbine Avenue.

The shoreline route was opposed by the City of Toronto and the Toronto Harbour Commission, and Margison was tasked with plotting a route north of the CNE grounds. This plan was delivered in July 1954. The change to an inland route north of the CNE grounds was estimated to cost another $11 million as the homes to the west of the CNE grounds would have to be purchased and demolished. This change moved the route from the Humber to the Ontario Hydro right-of-way next to the railway tracks, saving of waterfront. The expressway was moved to the north of Lake Shore Boulevard in the Sunnyside segment and the Jameson Avenue area.

The inland route, while not opposed in the Sunnyside and Jameson areas, faced opposition in its proposed route in the CNE to downtown segment. Alternative route proposals emerged in 1954 from the Toronto Harbour Commission, which wanted the route moved further north, and planner Edwin Kay, who proposed a tunnel through downtown. The decision was then made to proceed with the non-contentious parts of the original Margison plan, to build a new Humber bridge to connect with the QEW, the Queen Street extension, and the Humber River to Dowling section, demolishing Sunnyside Park and South Parkdale. Metro also approved the eastern section of the expressway from Sherbourne Street to the east, but the central, elevated section was left for further deliberation. Metro approved $33 million for the eastern and western sections in its 1955 budget, but omitted the Humber River bridge.

The route to the north of the CNE grounds followed a Hydro-electric right-of-way beside the railway tracks to the north of the Exhibition, using approximately of CNE land, and requiring the removal of the original Dufferin Gate and the demolition of two other CNE buildings. To make up for the loss of lands, Metro infilled into Lake Ontario to the breakwater.

East of the CNE grounds, the inland route proposed to fly over Fort York with a westbound on-ramp from Bathurst Street directly over the fort. Opposition from historical societies and the City of Toronto came to a head when the city refused to transfer the land to Metro Toronto. Gardiner himself and George O. Grant, the Metro Roads Commissioner, at first opposed the re-routing of the highway around the fort as it would mean a &quot;greater than six-degree curve&quot; in the highway, necessitating drivers to slow down. Gardiner rescinded his opposition to the change in March 1958 after visiting the site with a delegation from the City and historical societies. In 1959, Fort York was again under threat. A proposal was published to link Highway 400 to the Gardiner to meet in the vicinity of the fort. Gardiner proposed that Metro Toronto and the City share the costs of relocating the fort to the waterfront. In the end, the fort was not moved, the westbound on-ramp from Bathurst Street was cancelled, no interchange was built in the area and the Highway 400 extension was never approved.

===Construction===

Construction on the expressway began in 1955 with the building of The Queensway and the Keating Avenue (now Lake Shore Boulevard East) extension to the foot of Woodbine Avenue. The Gardiner was built in segments, with the final section being completed in 1966. The cost was approximately  million ($ in dollars). Construction of the first part of the actual Expressway started in 1956 with the Humber River bridge, followed by the Humber to Jameson segment. Max Tanenbaum&#x27;s York Steel supplied the iron girder sections that supported the road deck on the elevated sections.

;Humber River to Jameson Avenue

The route of the expressway around Humber Bay necessitated the demolition of the Sunnyside Amusement Park on the lakeshore, which had existed since 1925. Some amusements were moved to the CNE, others sold off or just destroyed. The carousel was moved to the newly built Disneyland. The Amusement Park lands were subsumed by the Lake Shore Boulevard expansion to six lanes. Only the Palais Royale hall, Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion and Sunnyside Pool were not demolished. A pedestrian bridge crossing was built from the foot of Roncesvalles Avenue to the Palais Royale site.

To the east of Sunnyside, the 1800s-era &#x27;South Parkdale&#x27; residential neighbourhood at the foot of Jameson Avenue was demolished in 1957. The expressway, like the railway just to the north, was cut through the area at lake shore level. An interchange was built at Jameson with on and off ramps to Lake Shore Boulevard, and Lake Shore Boulevard was expanded to six lanes in the area. This created a pedestrian barrier to the lake shore for Parkdale neighbourhood residents to the north. Efforts made by community groups over the next 20 years to restore access to the lake shore, including plans to cover the section of the Expressway and railway line, did not come to fruition. A pedestrian bridge over Lake Shore Boulevard at the foot of Jameson Avenue was eventually built. Jameson Avenue, which had previously been a street of mansions, saw intense apartment building development after the building of the Expressway.

The section between Humber River and Jameson Avenue was completed in 1958. The expressway, by then named the Gardiner Expressway, was officially opened by Gardiner himself and Ontario Premier Leslie Frost on August 8, 1958. When this section opened, it opened without guard-rails on the median dividing the different directions. Steel guard-rails and a &#x27;glare shield&#x27; were approved for this section in 1965 at a cost of . The road bridge of Dowling Avenue over the Gardiner was demolished in the 2000s, replaced by a pedestrian bridge.
;Jameson Avenue to York Street
The section between Jameson Avenue and Spadina Avenue was completed and opened on August 1, 1962 and the westbound lanes from York Street were opened on December 3, 1962. The eastbound lanes from Spadina to York opened in 1963. The elevated section starts from the north-east corner of the CNE. The route to the east of the CNE was modified to avoid passing over historic Old Fort York. The Gardiner passes over some of the fort&#x27;s property, and it is extra high to allow for possible multiple interchanges.

East of Fort York, the Gardiner was built entirely as an elevated route, through a predominantly industrial area, to the south of railway lands to reach downtown. The roadway was built directly overhead of Fleet Street (Fleet is now Lake Shore Boulevard West east of Bathurst but Fleet exists as parallel roadway on the north side from Bathurst to Strachan Avenue) through much of this section. The expressway off-ramp to York/Bay/Yonge Streets was developed as a two-lane eastbound &#x27;finger&#x27; flying over Harbour Street, south of the main roadway, descending to Harbour Street with a circular off-ramp to York Street northbound, and it was nicknamed the &quot;Hot Wheels Ramp&quot;.

;York Street to the Don Valley Parkway
This segment was completed in 1964. In the original proposal, the elevated segment would descend to ground level and meet the Don Valley Parkway at a clover-leaf interchange. It was instead constructed as an elevated section overhead of Lake Shore Boulevard and at its eastern end forks into a flyover of the Don River mouth and a separate connector to the east. The section between the Parkway and Yonge Street was built eight lanes wide.

;Don Valley Parkway to Leslie Street
Known as &quot;Gardiner East&quot;, this segment was elevated directly overhead of Lake Shore Boulevard, and opened in July 1966 without ceremony. This section had no access to the Don Valley Parkway, as westbound motorists had to continue underneath on Lake Shore Boulevard which met the Parkway on-ramp at a signalized intersection. Gardiner East ended just east of Leslie Street where eastbound traffic was forced to exit at an offramp descending to Lake Shore Boulevard (renamed from Keating Street) or a circular ramp to Leslie Street, while for westbound traffic entering the expressway there was a single lane onramp. The design left the eastern end open for a future connection with the proposed but never-built Scarborough Expressway, leaving this segment a spur route. This then-terminus of the Gardiner was also where the provincial Highway 2 routing shifted back to Lake Shore Boulevard, until Highway 2 was decommissioned in 1998.

; Highway 427 to the Humber River
This segment, built as part of the Queen Elizabeth Way by the Province of Ontario, was transferred to the City of Toronto in 1997, and designated as part of the Gardiner. The original QEW highway was built in the 1930s and connected to the Gardiner in the 1950s. This section of the QEW between the recently expanded Highway 27 (which would be renumbered as Highway 427 on December 4, 1971) and Lake Shore Boulevard was reconstructed in the late 1960s to 8-10 lanes which included a short collector-express system between Kipling Avenue and Royal York Road. The Humber River was the western border of the City of Toronto until the amalgamation of all Metropolitan Toronto municipalities into one Toronto.

===Naming===
On July 29, 1957, while still under construction, the Metro Toronto Roads and Traffic Committee, on the suggestion of Weston Mayor Harry Clark, (the committee chairman) renamed the Lakeshore Expressway to the F. G. Gardiner Freeway. Clark later suggested that the road had too many interchanges to be called a freeway, and amended the proposal to Gardiner Expressway. Metro Council approved the renaming in August 1957:


===From completion to the present===
By 1963, the first rooftop billboards along the Expressway were built, targeting the daily 40,000 to 60,000 motorists. Companies paid up to $3,000 per month to locate their billboard. Today, there are dozens of neon signs, billboards and video boards in the proximity of the Expressway, mostly in the sections between Roncesvalles Avenue to Spadina Avenue and east of Jarvis Street.

In 1965, 62 yellow &#x27;call boxes&#x27;, containing phones for emergency assistance, installed by the Ontario Motor League, were fixed to poles on the shoulders. These remained in operation until the 1990s. In 1994, the Road Emergency Services Communications Unit traffic management system began operation on the Gardiner and Lake Shore Boulevard and stranded motorists became quickly detected by the CCTV cameras and operators quickly dispatch assistance.

By 1966, rush hour traffic and collisions in the Jameson area meant that the Jameson westbound on-ramp was closed permanently during rush hours. That same year, after criticism of the safety of the expressway by Toronto coroner Morton Shulman, Metro started installing guardrails on the full length of the Gardiner and Don Valley expressways.

In 1968, the speed limit was proposed to be raised from to (today it is . Journalists openly questioned whether anyone could reach that top speed with the &quot;horrendous volume of traffic&quot; during peak rush times.

In 1988, the unmaintained grassy hillside in the Sunnyside area on the north side of the Gardiner from Roncesvalles Avenue to Wilson Park Avenue was cleaned up and planted with floral logos, with of garbage removed in the process. The advertising, which pays for the maintenance and cleaning of the hillside, permits no slogans and no alcohol or tobacco logos. The logos are planted yew bushes and are maintained by an independent company on the land, which is owned by the Canadian National Railway.

In the late 1980s, Metro Toronto proposed to widen the Gardiner to eight lanes from Strachan Avenue to the Humber, and extend Front Street from Bathurst Street west to connect with the highway. The widening proposal was never implemented as it depended on provincial funding which never materialized. Metro had planned the Front Street extension as part of allowing the Bay-Adelaide office complex and other development downtown to proceed. The Province did approve the Front Street extension, but the then-City of Toronto Council voted against it. The Front Street extension proposal was later resurrected as part of proposals to redevelop or dismantle the central section of the Gardiner.

The old Gardiner and Lake Shore Boulevard bridges over the Humber River, which had been in service since the 1950s, were removed and replaced by new structures from 1998-1999, at a cost of million. The old bridge pillars, which were resting on soil, not on bedrock, had sunk by a metre, giving the eastbound Gardiner a roller-coaster ride or &quot;Humber hump&quot;. Fatal collisions had occurred at the location, including an August 13, 1995, incident where a speeding automobile going eastbound became airborne and collided with a vehicle in the westbound lanes, killing three people. West of the Humber River, there was also a weaving problem on the westbound Gardiner due to an on-ramp from Lake Shore Boulevard followed by an off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard just before the CN rail underpass. As part of the Humber bridges replacement, the off-ramp (originally built in the 1960s as part of the QEW&#x27;s widening) was extended and placed upon its own alignment with the exit shifted to before the Humber River, separating traffic from the on-ramp&#x27;s entry point. 

In the 1990s, after 30 years of usage, the City found that the central elevated section needed extensive repairs, and the ongoing maintenance was expensive. Proposals started to be floated for the demolition of the elevated segment with its replacement to be buried underground in a tunnel, although such a course of action would have left the Downtown without an east-west freeway for several years. In the end, city council voted to have the elevated section extensively rehabilitated and the elevated section in downtown Toronto was closed down for extensive repairs. 
On April 1, 1997, the stretch of the Queen Elizabeth Way between Highway 427 and the Humber River was downloaded from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario to Metropolitan Toronto and was redesignated as part of the Gardiner.

Portions of the former QEW had parallel service roads along the roadway:

* Oxford Street – south side from east of Horner Avenue to Grand Avenue (broken sections)
* Mendota Road – north side from east of Royal York Road to Grand Avenue
* Queen Elizabeth Boulevard – north side from east of Islington Avenue to west of Royal York Road
* Fordhouse Boulevard – north side from east of The East Mall to Wickman Road
* Brockhouse Road – south side from east of The East Mall

The former QEW segment was not upgraded to contemporary standards when it was downloaded to the city, with particular concern over the old steel guard rail median barrier separating eastbound and westbound traffic. The steel guard rail dividing opposing traffic from The East Mall underpass and the Grand Avenue overpass was replaced by an Ontario &quot;tall-wall&quot; concrete barrier in early 2007, although steel guard rail still remains between the collector and express lanes. The city also replaced the province&#x27;s late 1960s-era truss light poles with shaded high mast lighting (similar to the lighting on the Don Valley Parkway) west of Kipling Avenue and east of Royal York Road, while a rehabilitation project for the railway underpass east of Park Lawn Avenue took place from 2014-15.
The elevated section between the Don River and Leslie Street known as &quot;Gardiner East&quot;, intended for connection to the cancelled Scarborough Expressway, was eventually demolished in 2001. Demolition was first proposed in 1990 by the Crombie Commission and the Lake Shore-Gardiner Task Force. The segment was in need of expensive repairs and a 1996 environmental assessment determined that it would cost $48 million to refurbish the Gardiner from the Don Valley Parkway to Leslie St., but only $34 million to tear it down. The final cost of the demolition was $39 million. In the wake of the demolition of Gardiner East, Lake Shore Boulevard has been revealed from the cover of the highway. Green boulevards have been implemented along the wide thoroughfare. Several supportive concrete pillars of the demolished elevated expressway remain standing as public art. Paved bicycle paths extend eastward for approximately two kilometres from the Martin Goodman Trail at Cherry Street to Coxwell Avenue. In 2002, a dual on-and-off ramp structure known as the Logan Avenue Ramp was completed just west of Carlaw Avenue, allowing Gardiner eastbound traffic to descend and merge with Lake Shore Boulevard as well as the opposite movement.

In October 2021, the section of the Gardiner east of the Don Valley Parkway ramps was demolished, including the Don River crossing and the Logan Avenue Ramp terminus at Lake Shore Boulevard East. Lake Shore Boulevard is being reconstructed east of the Don River and at Cherry Street. In conjunction with this, the eastbound on-ramp from Lake Shore at Jarvis was closed. Other traffic measures to guide on-ramp and off-ramp traffic at Jarvis were implemented. Eventually, the elevated section from Cherry Street to the Don Valley Parkway is to be rebuilt, with new connections to Lake Shore Boulevard.

In March 2024, the City initiated a three-year project to rebuild the section between Dufferin Street and Strachan Avenue. The road is narrowed to two lanes in each direction, and the eastbound on-ramp from Lake Shore Boulevard is closed for the duration. Construction will take a pause during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

===Historic capacity===
The highway has not been expanded since its initial construction. Commuting traffic into and out of the downtown core moves very slowly during the rush hours, which has led to growth in commuting by other modes. Introduced in the 1960s, the province&#x27;s GO Transit has increased train frequency and capacity along the Lakeshore route to the point where GO now carries 19% of inbound commuters to downtown, while the Gardiner carries 8%. The TTC carries 47% of commuters and other auto routes account for 26% of inbound commuters, according to 2006 figures.

===Elevated section maintenance===

The elevated section built with concrete girders was not built to withstand the use of road salt in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel and caused pieces of concrete to fall off. Remedial work had to be applied starting in the 1990s at a cost of per year. The remedial work included sealing expansion joints to force the salty water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. Exposed steel was sand-blasted and repainted.

The annual maintenance costs for the Gardiner Expressway were estimated in 2011 at million per year. According to the City of Toronto, the City monitors the pillars on an ongoing basis and &quot;re-coats&quot; the pillars with new coatings of concrete, giving each new pillar an estimated 30 years of extended usage. A section of concrete fell down onto Lake Shore Boulevard in June 2011. In May 2012, pieces fell from the elevated section near Jarvis, and a piece fell from the overpass over Parkside Drive. In June 2012, concrete fell from the elevated section at Yonge St. and Lake Shore Blvd. which struck a driver&#x27;s vehicle causing minor damages.

One eastbound lane was closed near Cherry Street due to deterioration. The concrete parapet wall could no longer support the light standard in that location. The light standard was instead relocated into the rightmost lane, and the lane was closed. Two locations, at Fort York Boulevard and near Cherry Street were reinforced to prevent &quot;punch-throughs&quot; (holes) from happening on the road surface, potentially knocking a large piece of concrete to the ground below and causing a dangerous incident for the vehicles above. It was estimated in December 2012 by the City of Toronto Infrastructure Department that the Expressway has a backlog of million in repairs. Starting in 2013, the City began to carry out million worth of repairs over nine years. Temporary wood bracing and decking have been added to the underside of the road deck to prevent punch-throughs, but only provide a short term fix and will require a long term solution to prevent future deck collapse.

===York/Bay/Yonge Streets ramps rebuild===
The original York/Bay/Yonge Streets off-ramp was nicknamed the &quot;Hot Wheels ramp&quot; among city staff, due to its looping around to York Street. In 2009, the City of Toronto commenced a study of the York/Bay/Yonge off-ramps and the Bay Street on-ramps &quot;to support and enhance the pedestrian and park spaces in the immediate area while maintaining acceptable traffic capacity and operations&quot;. The preferred option identified in the study would be to reconfigure the off-ramp to connect at Simcoe Street, and close the on-ramp from northbound Bay Street to the eastbound Gardiner. The change to the ramps was approved in August 2010 by City Council. An Environmental Assessment was completed in 2013.

In 2016, the City of Toronto began construction work on the project. In phase one, the new off-ramp at Lower Simcoe Street was built to feed into a widened Harbour Street. The York/Bay/Yonge off-ramp started demolition in April 2017. This was followed by the widening of Harbour Street from three to four lanes. York Street Park was opened where the York Street off-ramp previously looped, although many of the support pillars were not removed. The York Street Park was built in 2022–23 according to the &quot;Love Park&quot; design chosen in 2018. The new off-ramp opened to traffic on January 28, 2018. The newly-christened Love Park opened in June 2023.

===Gardiner Expressway Strategic Rehabilitation Plan===
Starting in 2018, the City of Toronto has been rehabilitating the Gardiner from the 427 highway to the Don Valley Parkway. The project is known as the &quot;Gardiner Expressway Strategic Rehabilitation Plan&quot;. The work is being done in stages and is already in progress:
# &quot;Jarvis to Cherry Streets&quot; - Replacement of the elevated portion. (complete)
# &quot;Strachan to Dufferin Street&quot; (in progress) - Replacement of the elevated portion. (2024–2026) This will progress in three stages, replacing two lanes at a time. This was initially contracted to cost CA$260 million, in 2023 and take three years. Additional changes to the project to speed up completion by one year will add CA$73 million, to be paid by Ontario taxpayers. The target is for completion before the 2026 FIFA World Cup in July 2026.
# &quot;Highway 427 to the Humber River&quot; - Reconstruction of roadway and rehabilitation of several bridges. (2026–2029)
# &quot;Grand Magazine Boulevard to York Street&quot; - Replacement of the elevated portion. (2026–2028)
# &quot;Cherry Street to the Don Valley Parkway&quot; - Replacement of the elevated portion and the interchange with the DVP. (2026–2030) This includes the demolition of the off-ramps to Logan Avenue, already done.
# &quot;Humber River to Dufferin Street&quot; - Undetermined rehabilitation. (2029–2030)

===Transfer to province===
In November 2016, the City of Toronto and mayor John Tory considered imposing a toll to use the Gardiner and the Don Valley Parkway, to cover the maintenance costs of the highway and support public transit construction. However, the plan was rejected by the Ontario government.

In November 2023, the municipal and provincial governments announced a tentative deal which will see responsibility for the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway transferred to the province, with them to be maintained as provincial highways. In exchange, the City government accepted dropping its opposition to the Ontario Place and Ontario Science Centre redevelopments. 

This has meant that  billion in cost originally to be borne by Toronto taxpayers will be borne by Ontario taxpayers. The City intends to use the monies for various projects over the 2024–2034 time frame, including  million for the TTC.

==Future==
Starting in the 1990s, several proposals have been made to dismantle or replace the central elevated section. Lack of municipal funds and political will have repeatedly stalled such plans.

In 1991, the Royal Commission On The Future of the Toronto Waterfront released a report entitled &quot;Report 15: Toronto Central Waterfront Transportation Corridor Study&quot;. It determined that the combination of the Gardiner Expressway, Lake Shore Boulevard and railway uses tilted the land use to too much of a corridor use, and impacted negatively on the usage of the area. The report proposed that the City could A) retain or ameliorate; B) replace or C) remove the Expressway. The then-Metro Toronto and City of Toronto governments chose option &quot;A&quot; to retain or ameliorate.

===Waterfront Revitalization Task Force demolition proposal===

In March 2000, the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Task Force proposed burying the section from east of the CNE to Yonge Street, as part of the plans for waterfront revitalization, at an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. The City of Toronto accepted the report in principle and formed the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation (TWRC), (today&#x27;s Waterfront Toronto).

In 2004, the TWRC issued a report to the City about possible options for the Gardiner. It was released to the public in September 2006. It proposed four options:

# Leave the Gardiner as is, at an annual cost of million
# Replace the roadway with at-grade or below grade roads at a total cost of billion
# Remove the Lake Shore Boulevard roadway underneath the elevated section and construct buildings at a cost of million
# Removing the Gardiner east of Spadina, and expanding Lake Shore Boulevard at a cost of million. This was the TWRC&#x27;s recommended option.

An overview of the recommended changes:

* retain elevated portions from west of Dufferin Street to Spadina Avenue
* extend Front Street west of Bathurst to connect with the Gardiner west of Strachan Avenue.
* add new on/off ramps to connect with Front Street extension
* replace elevated portion from Spadina Avenue to Simcoe Street with two five-lane roadway (Lake Shore Blvd) separated by landscaped median
* replace elevated portion from Simcoe Street to Jarvis Street with two five-lane roadway (Lake Shore Blvd) separated by city block
* replace elevated portion from Jarvis Street to Don River with two four-lane roadway (Lake Shore Blvd) separated by landscaped median
* relocate Don River channel and re-build new ramps onto the Don Valley Parkway with surface roadway (Lake Shore Blvd)

Councillor Jane Pitfield, who was running for Mayor, criticized the proposal, stating that &quot;From the canvassing I have done all over the city, the majority of people say they want the Gardiner to stay where it is.&quot; Suburban councillors Gloria Lindsay Luby and Doug Holyday came out opposed while inner-city councillor Kyle Rae fought for the proposal. Mayor David Miller did not favour the proposal either, stating that there were other, higher priorities. The proposal did not come to Council for discussion and vote.

===Replacement proposals===

In 1996, the Crombie-led Waterfront Trust asked the builders (Canadian Highways International Corp) of the Highway 407 toll road to investigate replacing the Gardiner. The Corporation proposed a tunnel to replace the elevated section from Dufferin to Yonge Street at a cost of $1 billion. City staff pointed out that the tunnel would have to avoid several obstacles, including:

# storm sewers just west of Fort York and under Portland Street;
#a high-voltage electrical line under Strachan Avenue;
#a filtered water intake to the John Street pumping station;
#a streetcar line running under lower Bay Street;
#a streetcar loop on the north side of the Exhibition Grounds; and
#the Don River

The proposal planned to put tolls on the new roadway to pay for the cost of building it and to reduce the traffic but it refused (2017 update).

Unsolicited proposals are made regularly by citizens, agencies and corporations of Toronto.

In 2005, a proposal named the &quot;Toronto Waterfront Viaduct&quot; was presented by a group of Toronto citizens, calling for the replacement of the existing elevated expressway with an 8 to 10-lane cable-stayed viaduct over the Lakeshore rail corridor. This proposal combined the freeway with a new Lakeshore light rail transit system, and lanes for bicycle and pedestrian traffic. The proposed design used cantilever bridge structure to minimize disruption of the railroad. By building the replacement route on a parallel corridor, current traffic would not be disrupted.

Two proposals were made public in June 2009, when the City of Toronto Council was considering the proposal to tear down the eastern section. Mark Fraser, a Toronto CAD technician, and local resident opposed to the removal of the Gardiner, put forth a proposed design for a complete overhaul of the Gardiner he called the &quot;Green Expressway&quot;. The design would consist of either a channel or tunnel built under the Gardiner with two levels of traffic (one for local highway traffic, and one for express traffic through the city), a ground-level local street, and a linear park and retail concourse built above the street.

Later in June 2009, Les Klein, a Toronto architect also opposed to the removal of the Gardiner, proposed adding an upper level deck covered with plants, bike lanes, walking paths and solar panels (for expressway lighting) on a stretch of the expressway, entitled the &#x27;Green Ribbon&#x27;. The estimated cost was between $500 million to $800 million.

===Western Waterfront plan===
The Western Waterfront Master Plan calls for reconstruction of the Jameson/Dunn interchange to place the eastbound lanes of Lake Shore Boulevard onto the north side of the Gardiner, moving the Jameson westbound exit east to British Columbia Drive, converting the Jameson Street bridge into a pedestrian overpass to reclaim approximately of parkland. The Master Plan passed a Class environmental assessment in 2009. The City started to replace several deteriorating structures in May 2010, to prepare the structures for the new roadway alignment. The construction of the realigned Lake Shore Boulevard and the related Gardiner ramp changes is slated for after 2014, after completion of a detailed environmental assessment for the parkland and roadway project.

In 2022, the City of Toronto published an update to the Western Waterfront Master Plan that outlined which proposals had had action taken and which ones had not. In 2023, the City of Toronto published an interactive map of the area, which was open for comment until December 13, 2023. The findings and proposed implementation recommendations are anticipated to be reported to the Infrastructure and Environment Committee in late 2024.

===East of Jarvis review===
In May 2008, Waterfront Toronto (the former TWRC) proposed the demolition of the segment from Jarvis Street to the Don River and construction of a widened Lake Shore Boulevard in the style of University Avenue at a projected cost of $200 to $300 million. The proposal shelved the previous plan to demolish the central section and the construction of the Front Street Extension. Waterfront Toronto proposed to get started on the environmental assessment of the demolition, which is expected to take up to five years and cost $10 million. Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong criticized the proposal, pointing out that the city already had a $300 million backlog of road repairs. Mayor David Miller endorsed the proposal, noting that the funds for the demolition and the eight-lane boulevard would come from monies saved by not building the Front Street Extension, and money saved on the maintenance of the elevated highway. In July 2008, City Council voted to proceed with the environmental assessment. In March 2009, Waterfront Toronto started the environmental assessment consultation process, with open houses and an online consultation web site. The Terms of Reference were approved by City Council in May 2009 and the Government of Ontario in September 2009 and an Environmental Assessment was expected to start in April 2010.

City staff abandoned the Environmental Assessment in November 2010, to await direction from the new Council after the election of Rob Ford as Toronto mayor. Councillor Minnan-Wong, who had become chairman of the public works committee of Council, later described the removal project as &quot;dead&quot;, and the estimated $300 million cost as &quot;too expensive&quot; in light of a $270 million backlog on repairs of Toronto roads. Minnan-Wong was further quoted as saying that &quot;tearing down the Gardiner Expressway, an important and vital transportation corridor, doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot;.

In 2013, as part of a staff report on condition the Gardiner, City staff reported to Council that a decision on the eastern segment would have to be made. The section was identified by staff as having reached the end of its lifespan, unless a significant rebuild were to be done. They estimated that it needed to be made no later than 2014 to co-ordinate with needed remedial work.
After consideration of the proposal to repair the elevated section, Council voted in January 2013 to &#x27;restart&#x27; the environmental assessment of the section east of Jarvis. Waterfront Toronto was engaged to deliver public feedback on various proposals, that of keeping the Gardiner, reconfiguring it or demolishing it. After the review, the consensus proposal was to demolish the expressway section as being cost-effective with little impact on commuters. Before Council was to vote on the proposal, Council decided instead to direct City staff to study a &quot;hybrid&quot; proposal, keeping that part of the Gardiner connecting the expressway to the Don Valley Parkway (but replaced with new ramps beginning at Cherry and north of current structure), while demolishing the rest. Also this option will result in the extension of Queen&#x27;s Quay east of Cherry Street to meet with Don Roadway.

City staff studied the hybrid proposal and reported on the cost of the three options over 100 years in April 2015. The cost of the hybrid proposal was estimated at $414 million for construction and $505 million for upkeep. The &#x27;keep as-is&#x27; proposal was the next most expensive at $342 million for a rebuild and $522 million of the next 100 years. The demolish proposal was the least expensive at a total of $326 million immediately and $135 million for upkeep of a new surface boulevard. After public consultations, City Council is to vote on the proposals after a final report is delivered in June 2015 from city staff.

The review came to City Council for consideration at its June 2015 session. Prior to the meeting, several special interest groups weighed in with their opinions on the debate. A group of Toronto developers came out in favour of full removal. The Ontario Trucking Association and Canadian Automobile Association came out in favour of the &quot;hybrid&quot; option. Mayor John Tory announced he would support the &quot;hybrid&quot; option and speculation in the media was that the vote would be close between the &quot;hybrid&quot; and &quot;remove&quot; options. Debate started on June 10, 2015, and was completed on June 11, 2015. City Council voted 24–21 in favour of the &quot;hybrid&quot; option, 26–19 against the &quot;remove&quot; option, and 44–1 against the &quot;maintain&quot; option. To build support for the &quot;hybrid&quot; option among Councillors, Mayor Tory added proposals to direct City staff to study the routing of the connection to the Don Valley Parkway to try to retain as much development potential as possible compared to the &quot;remove&quot; option and report on the feasibility of tunnelling the section, something not even covered in the studies, and which would require a new environmental assessment and possibly a further delay. These passed as part of the approval of the &quot;hybrid&quot; option. Council has asked to receive the new studies for September 2015. As of January 2020, the removal of the section east of the DVP is not expected to start until 2024. In September 2015, staff returned with a report updating their progress on new routings for the hybrid proposal. Three new routes would free up more lands for development, with some external submissions received that will also be studied. Staff will report to Council committees in January 2016 and Council is expected to debate the matter again in February 2016. In July 2018, Aecon won a contract to carry out the revitalization of the expressway between Jarvis and Cherry Streets, and work was completed by the end of 2020.

Construction on the hybrid option commenced on August 31, 2021. This started with the closure and removal of the Gardiner Expressway&#x27;s eastern terminus, the Don River crossing and Logan Avenue Ramp, and since then Gardiner traffic defaults to the Don Valley Parkway.

===Lower Yonge Street Precinct study===
The City of Toronto and Waterfront Toronto completed a study of the district between Lake Shore Boulevard and Queen&#x27;s Quay from Yonge Street to Lower Jarvis Street. The block will be redeveloped from its current industrial/commercial use to residential/commercial usage. The large-scale development will affect the Gardiner Expressway connections and the local streets to accommodate the development. Among its recommendations are the removal of the eastbound Bay Street on-ramp, the shortening of the Lower Jarvis eastbound off-ramp to terminate at Yonge Street, the extension of Harbour Street east to Lower Jarvis. The current terminus at Yonge will require:

* demolition of the loading area behind the Toronto Star building with Pinnacle One Yonge condominium resulting in creating a clearance for Harbour Street from Yonge to Freeland Streets
* redevelopment of LCBO campus use land now used for LCBO warehouse, Head Office and retail store as LCBO moves to east side of Cooper Street as 100 Queen&#x27;s Quay East. Current site to be become new development with warehouse retained and a new city park built on south half Harbour will be extended from Freeland to Cooper Streets.
* re-development of the Loblaws store and parking lot as two parcels of land. New road built east from Cooper to Jarvis Streets.

A major part of the change is the disconnection of Harbour Street from Lake Shore Boulevard (by removing the S-curve at Yonge) and tie-in to the street&#x27;s eastern extension, and the extension of Church Street south via a tunnel (due to existing structures at Conger Coal Lane as well as railway tracks and Gardiner) to connect to Cooper Street at Lake Shore Boulevard. The Environmental Assessment completed in May 2018.

==Closures==
The Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway close annually for two events. The Ride for Heart closes the Gardiner Expressway east of the Humber River and the entire length of the Don Valley Parkway in both directions and is typically held on the first Sunday in June from 2am to 2pm. The Toronto Triathlon Festival closes the eastbound lanes of the Gardiner Expressway east of the Humber River and the northbound lanes of the Don Valley Parkway south of Eglinton Avenue and is held on the third Sunday of July from 2 am to 12 pm. The annual closure of the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway for Ride for Heart has been criticized for the amount of disruption it causes and its impact on traffic congestion. A Toronto City Councillor criticized the event and believes it should be relocated to city streets. This event also causes a complete shutdown of all GO bus service to Union GO Bus Terminal from 9 am to 2:30 pm on the day the event is held.

On March 5, 2007, a section of the Gardiner Expressway was closed between Spadina Avenue and Jarvis Street due to the threat of ice about the size of a kitchen table falling from the CN Tower. Several days before, a storm with snow and freezing rain had caused a great deal of ice to accrete on the tower. As the weather warmed and the sun heated the tower&#x27;s concrete, large pieces of ice began falling off the tower and falling hundreds of metres to the ground below. Although nobody was injured, the Gardiner was closed as a precautionary measure. On March 6, cooler weather reduced the risk of falling ice, and prevailing wind conditions had changed, reducing the risks of ice falling onto the highway; the road was reopened subsequently.

On May 3, 2007, at around 7:00 a.m., a chunk of concrete about the size of a loaf of bread fell from the Kipling Avenue bridge onto the Gardiner Expressway. It missed cars and caused no damage, bouncing harmlessly away despite the morning rush hour traffic. City crews were quickly sent to close off lanes of traffic to begin an inspection of the structure, which is a late 1960s post-tensioned design built by the province while it was still part of the QEW. This incident raised fears about the safety of the highway, particularly with memories of the then-recent overpass collapse in Laval, Quebec.

On the evening of May 10, 2009, as part of the protests against the Sri Lankan Civil War, approximately 2,000 protestors blocked the downtown section of the Gardiner Expressway in both directions, leaving thousands of motorists stranded for several hours, and backing up traffic on the Expressway for several kilometres. Toronto Police chief Bill Blair called this demonstration by Tamil protestors on the Gardiner &quot;unlawful&quot; and &quot;unsafe&quot;. Police forces from across the Greater Toronto Area including the Ontario Provincial Police were brought in for reinforcement. The highway was reopened shortly after midnight, when the protestors moved back to Queen&#x27;s Park. This marked the first time that the Expressway was shut down due to a large-scale demonstration.

<doc id="314951" wikidata="Q27118301" url="?curid=314951" title="Academic tenure in North America">
<text>Academic tenure in the United States and Canada is a contractual right that grants a teacher or professor a permanent position of employment at an academic institution such as a university or school. Tenure is intended to protect teachers from dismissal without just cause, and to allow development of thoughts or ideas considered unpopular or controversial among the community. In North America, tenure is granted only to educators whose work is considered to be exceptionally productive and beneficial in their careers.

Academic tenure became a standard for education institutions in North America with the introduction of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP)&#x27;s &quot;1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure&quot;. In this statement, the AAUP provides a definition of academic tenure: &quot;a means to certain ends, specifically: (1) freedom of teaching and research and of extramural activities, and (2) a sufficient degree of economic security to make the profession attractive to men and women of ability.&quot;

==Academic tenure (colleges and universities)==
Under the tenure systems adopted by many universities and colleges in the United States and Canada, some faculty positions have tenure and some do not. Typical systems (such as the widely adopted &quot;1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure&quot; of the American Association of University Professors) allow only a limited period to establish a record of published research, ability to attract grant funding, academic visibility, teaching excellence, and administrative or community service. They limit the number of years that any employee can remain employed as a non-tenured instructor or professor, compelling the institution to grant tenure to or terminate an individual, with significant advance notice, at the end of a specified time period. Some institutions require promotion to Associate Professor as a condition of tenure. An institution may also offer other academic positions that are not time-limited, with titles such as lecturer, adjunct professor, or research professor, but these positions do not carry the possibility of tenure and are said to be not &quot;tenure track&quot;.

Academic tenure&#x27;s original purpose was to guarantee the right to academic freedom: it protects teachers and researchers when they dissent from prevailing opinion, openly disagree with authorities of any sort, or spend time on unfashionable topics. Thus academic tenure is similar to the lifetime tenure that protects some judges from external pressure. Without job security, the scholarly community as a whole may experience pressure to favor noncontroversial lines of academic inquiry. The intent of tenure is to allow original ideas to be more likely to arise, by giving scholars the intellectual autonomy to investigate the problems and solutions as they see fit and to report their honest conclusions. However, it has also become a type of job security for professors.

In North American universities and colleges, the tenure track has long been a defining feature of professorial employment, although it is less than universal. In North American universities, positions that carry tenure, or the opportunity to attain tenure, have grown more slowly than non-tenure-track positions, leading to a large &quot;academic underclass&quot;. For example, most US universities currently supplement the work of tenured professors with the services of non-tenured adjunct professors, academics who teach classes for lower wages and fewer employment benefits under relatively short-term contracts. For those that are tenure track, it generally takes about seven years to earn tenure while working as an assistant professor. Tenure is determined by a combination of research, teaching, and service, with each factor weighted according to the values of a particular university, college or department. There is some evidence that professors that share more (e.g. via open access publications, open data, or open source hardware development) gain an advantage in obtaining tenure because they are cited more and can thus develop a higher h-index. This competition for limited resources could lead to ethically questionable behaviour.

==History in the United States ==

===19th century===
In the 19th century, university professors largely served at the pleasure of the board of trustees of the university. Sometimes, major donors could successfully remove professors or prohibit the hiring of certain individuals; nonetheless, a &quot;de facto&quot; tenure system existed. Usually professors were only fired for interfering with the religious principles of a college, and most boards were reluctant to discipline professors. The courts rarely intervened in dismissals.

In one debate of the Cornell University Board of Trustees in the 1870s, a businessman trustee argued against the prevailing system of &quot;de facto&quot; tenure, but lost the argument. Despite the power retained in the board, academic freedom prevailed. Another example is the 1894 case of Richard T. Ely, a University of Wisconsin–Madison professor who advocated labor strikes and labor law reform. Though the Wisconsin legislature and business interests pressed for his dismissal, the board of trustees of the university passed a resolution committing itself to academic freedom, and to retaining him (without tenure):

===From 1900 to 1940===
In 1900, the presidents of Harvard University, Columbia University, and the University of Chicago each made clear that no donor could any longer dictate faculty decisions; such a donor&#x27;s contribution would be unwelcome. The notorious case of the dismissal of G. B. Halsted by the University of Texas in 1903 after nineteen years of service may have accelerated the adoption of the tenure concept.

In 1915, this was followed by the American Association of University Professors&#x27; declaration of principles—the traditional justification for academic freedom and tenure.

The AAUP&#x27;s declaration of principles recommended that:
* Trustees raise faculty salaries, but not bind their consciences with restrictions.
* Only committees of other faculty members can judge a member of the faculty. This would also insulate higher administration from external accountability decisions.
* Faculty appointments be made by other faculty and chairpersons, with three elements:
*# Clear employment contracts
*# formal academic tenure, and
*# clearly stated grounds for dismissal.

While the AAUP pushed reform, tenure battles were a campus non-issue. In 1910, a survey of 22 universities showed that most professors held their positions with &quot;presumptive permanence&quot;. At a third of colleges, assistant professor appointments were considered permanent, while at most colleges multi-year appointments were subject to renewal. Only at one university did a governing board ratify a president&#x27;s decisions on granting tenure.

An important tenure case in this period was the 1936 denial of tenure for Jerome Davis, a professor of practical philanthropy at Yale Divinity School.

===From 1940 to 1972===
In 1940, the AAUP recommended that the academic tenure probationary period be seven years, which is still the current norm. It also suggested that a tenured professor could not be dismissed without adequate cause, except &quot;under extraordinary circumstances, because of financial emergencies.&quot; Also, the statement recommended that the professor be given the written reasons for dismissal and an opportunity to be heard in self-defense. Another purpose of the academic tenure probationary period was raising the performance standards of the faculty by pressing new professors to perform to the standard of the school&#x27;s established faculty.

The most significant adoption of academic tenure occurred after 1945, when the influx of returning GIs returning to school led to quickly expanding universities with severe professorial faculty shortages. These shortages dogged the academy for ten years, and that is when the majority of universities started offering formal tenure as a side benefit. The rate of tenure (percent of tenured university faculty) increased to 52 percent. In fact, the demand for professors was so high in the 1950s that the American Council of Learned Societies held a conference in Cuba noting the too-few doctoral candidates to fill positions in English departments. During the McCarthy era, loyalty oaths were required of many state employees, and neither formal academic tenure nor the Constitutional principles of freedom of speech and association were protection from dismissal. Some professors were dismissed for their political affiliations. During the 1960s, many professors supported the anti-war movement against the Vietnam War, and more than 20 state legislatures passed resolutions calling for specific professorial dismissals and a change to the academic tenure system.

===From 1972 to the present===
Two landmark U.S. Supreme Court cases changed tenure in 1972: (i) &quot;Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth&quot;, 408 US 564; and (ii) &quot;Perry v. Sindermann&quot;, 408 US 593. These two cases held that a professor&#x27;s claim to entitlement must be more than a subjective expectancy of continued employment. Rather, there must be a contractual relationship or a reference in a contract to a specific tenure policy or agreement. Further, the court held that a tenured professor who is discharged from a public college has been deprived of a property interest, and so due process applies, requiring certain procedural safeguards (the right to personally appear in a hearing, the right to examine evidence and respond to accusations, the right to have advisory counsel).

Later cases specified other bases for dismissal: (i) if a professor&#x27;s conduct were incompatible with his duties (&quot;Trotman v. Bd. of Trustees of Lincoln Univ.&quot;, 635 F.2d 216 (2d Cir.1980)); (ii) if the discharge decision is based on an objective rule (&quot;Johnson v. Bd. of Regents of U. Wisc. Sys.&quot;, 377 F. Supp 277, (W.D. Wisc. 1974)). After these cases were judged, the number of reported cases in the matter of academic tenure increased more than two-fold: from 36 cases filed during the decade 1965–1975, to 81 cases filed during the period 1980–1985.

During the 1980s there were no notable tenure battles, but three were outstanding in the 1990s. In 1995, the Florida Board of Regents tried to re-evaluate academic tenure, but managed only to institute a weak, post-tenure performance review. Likewise, in 1996 the Arizona Board of Regents attempted to re-evaluate tenure, fearing that few full-time professors actually taught university undergraduate students, mainly because the processes of achieving academic tenure underweighted teaching. However, faculty and administrators defended themselves and the board of trustees dropped its review. Finally, the University of Minnesota Regents tried from 1995 to 1996 to enact 13 proposals, including these policy changes: to allow the regents to cut faculty base- salaries for reasons other than a university financial emergency including poor performance; to fire tenured professors when their programs were eliminated or restructured if the university were unable to retrain or reassign them. In the Minnesota system, 87 percent of university faculty were either tenured or on the tenure track, and the professors vehemently defended themselves. Eventually, the president of the system opposed these changes and weakened a compromise plan by the dean of the law school before it then failed. &quot;The board overreached what was the available political consensus,” according to Richard Chait, a Harvard professor and tenure specialist hired as a consultant to the regents. In Chait&#x27;s &quot;The Questions of Tenure&quot;, a lack of data is credited for hampering reform of the tenure code in Minnesota. The board chairman resigned later that year.

The period since 1972 has seen a steady decline in the percentage (although not the numbers) of college and university teaching positions in the US that are either tenured or tenure-track. United States Department of Education statistics put the combined tenured/tenure-track rate at 56% for 1975, 46.8% for 1989, and 31.9% for 2005. That is to say, by the year 2005, 68.1% of US college teachers were neither tenured nor eligible for tenure; a full 48% of teachers that year were part-time employees.

====Racial and gender disparities====
During the latter part of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, it was assumed that as the disproportionately white, male cohort of U.S. tenured faculty members retired, they would be replaced by a more representative cohort. Although diversity in tenured faculty has improved since the 1990s, the current cohort is still not representative: in fall 2020, 59.4% of tenured faculty in the United States were men and 73.8% were white, while in fall 1991, 79.5% of tenured faculty were men and 90.4% were white. In fall 2019, 4.8% of tenured faculty were Black and only 2.3% were Black women.

Accounting for these disparities, numerous studies have shown that racially and ethnically underrepresented professors &quot;still experience social isolation, subtle and occasionally overt prejudice, a lack of mentors and ambiguous expectations.&quot; Notably, a study published in 2024, using a sample of over 1,500 promotion and tenure decisions made across 5 US institutions between 2015 and 2022, found evidence of racial disparities in the promotion and tenure process. Specifically, the authors found that historically underrepresented minority (Black and Hispanic) faculty, compared to White and Asian faculty, received on average 7% more negative votes and were 44% less likely to receive a unanimous vote at the college-level of voting.

==Revocation==

In 1994, a study in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; found that &quot;about 50 tenured professors [in the US] are dismissed each year for cause.&quot; While tenure protects the occupant of an academic position, it does not protect against the elimination of that position. For example, a university that is under financial stress may take the drastic step of eliminating or downsizing some departments, in which case both tenured and untenured faculty are let go.

In 1985, the United States Supreme Court decision &quot;Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill&quot; determined that a tenured teacher cannot be dismissed without oral or written notice regarding the charges against him or her. Additionally, the Court held that the employer must provide an explanation of the employer&#x27;s decision, including a discussion of the employer&#x27;s evidence, and the teacher must be given an opportunity for a fair and meaningful hearing.

==Criticisms of tenure for school teachers==
In 2012, tenure for school teachers was challenged in a California lawsuit called &quot;Vergara v. California&quot;. The primary issue in the case was the impact of tenure on student outcomes and on equity in education. On June 10, 2014, the trial judge ruled that California&#x27;s teacher tenure statute produced disparities that &quot;shock the conscience&quot; and violate the equal protection clause of the California Constitution; his ruling was later overturned on appeal.

==Criticisms of tenure for college professors==
The American Association of University Professors has handled hundreds of cases where it alleges that tenure candidates were treated unfairly. The AAUP has censured many major and minor universities and colleges for such alleged tenure abuses.

Tenure at many universities depends primarily on research publications and research grants, although the universities&#x27; official policies are that tenure depends on research, teaching and service. The demand that a professor show exemplary production in research is intense. Unless a professor&#x27;s research is in pedagogy (for instance within a School of Education), articles in refereed teaching journals and obtaining teaching grants often do not contribute greatly towards tenure, as the research is not focused on the professor&#x27;s creating new knowledge in his or her home discipline. Business schools also consider contribution to practice, but this is difficult to implement due to a lack of generally accepted criteria and metrics.

At some universities the department chairperson sends forward the department recommendation on tenure. There have been cases, such as one case at The University of Texas at San Antonio (2008), where the faculty voted unanimously to tenure an individual but the chairperson sent forward a recommendation not to grant tenure despite the faculty support. 

Tenure decisions can result in fierce political battles. In one tenure battle at Indiana University, an untenured professor was accused of threatening violence against those who opposed his promotion, his wife briefly went on a hunger strike, and many called for the entire department to be disbanded. In another instance in February 2010, Amy Bishop with the University of Alabama in Huntsville shot and killed colleagues after losing her appeal for tenure.

Since the 1970s philosopher John Searle has called for major changes to tenure systems, calling the practice &quot;without adequate justification.&quot; Searle suggests that to reduce publish or perish pressures that can hamper their classroom teaching, capable professors be given tenure much sooner than the standard four-to-six years. However, Searle also argued that tenured professors be reviewed every seven years to help eliminate &quot;incompetent&quot; teachers who can otherwise find refuge in the tenure system.

It has also been suggested that tenure may have the effect of diminishing political and academic freedom among those seeking it – that they must appear to conform to the political or academic views of the field or the institution where they seek tenure. For example, in &quot;The Trouble with Physics&quot;, the theoretical physicist Lee Smolin says &quot;...it is practically career suicide for young theoretical physicists not to join the field of string theory...&quot;. It is certainly possible to view the tenure track as a long-term demonstration of the candidate&#x27;s political and academic conformity. Patrick J. Michaels, a controversial part-time climate science research professor at the University of Virginia, wrote: &quot;...tenure has had the exact opposite effect as to its stated goal of diversifying free expression. Instead, it stifles free speech in the formative years of a scientist&#x27;s academic career, and all but requires a track record in support of paradigms that might have outgrown their usefulness.&quot; However, this point of view would tend to argue not against the abolition of the tenure system, but the shortening of the probationary period, since after receiving tenure, professors no longer feel the pressure to conform to their discipline&#x27;s mainline views.

As more academics publish research in Internet and multimedia formats, organizations such as the American Council of Learned Societies and Modern Language Association have recommended changes to promotion and tenure criteria, and some university departments have made such changes to reflect the increasing importance of networked scholarship.

The root of some of these criticisms is that elsewhere in the world, there are very few tenure systems, and no time-limited employment. The system in the rest of the English speaking world, for example, is based on promotion up union-negotiated payscales, usually with automatic advancement towards the top of a grade, with the luckier faculty members being on &#x27;permanent contracts&#x27; with no end-date. To go to the next grade (e.g. from associate professor to professor), an application must be submitted, and the criteria are as exacting as in North America. Simon Batterbury argues this system offers less opportunity for sabotage, and more adherence to social justice goals, even though &#x27;permanent&#x27; staff members can be fired at any time.

== Invisible labor ==
Invisible labor (aka invisible work) in academia refers to the work carried out by collegiate faculty that largely goes unrecognized in terms of tenure evaluation. Two major examples of invisible labor are student mentoring and university diversity/inclusionary work. Though student mentoring and inclusion are important aspects to student success, these tasks are often undervalued in faculty evaluations when compared to other academic work, such as publishing research and attaining grant money.

This labor is often carried out disproportionately by faculty from marginalized backgrounds. While the majority of professors agree that diversity is very important to education, most of the diversity and inclusionary work is carried out by non-male, non-white, and first-generation faculty. Because of their diverse backgrounds, professors from marginalized backgrounds often experience increased pressure in performing diversity service tasks, while being held to the same standards for promotion. While diversity among students has been increasing, the rate of diversity among professors has progressed at a much slower pace. This disparity places a greater demand on minority professors to mentor students, who often seek out mentors from a similar background. Intersectionality appears to play a role in invisible labor, as professors with multiple marginalized identities experience increased pressure to engage in low-promotability work.

==Defenses of tenure for college professors==
Defenders of tenure, like Ellen Schrecker and Aeon J. Skoble, generally acknowledge flaws in how tenure approvals are currently run and problems in how tenured professors might use their time, security, and power; however, as Skoble puts it, the &quot;downsides are either not as bad as claimed, or [are] costs outweighed by the benefits&quot;—and he points out that the very debate about tenure in which he is engaging is made possible by the academic freedom which tenure makes possible. &quot;Tenure remains scholars&#x27; best defense of free inquiry and heterodoxy,&quot; writes Skoble, &quot;especially in these times of heightened polarization and internet outrage. Let us focus on fixing it, not scrapping it.&quot; 

The job security granted by tenure is necessary to recruit talented individuals into university professorships, because in many fields private industry jobs pay significantly more; as Schrecker puts it, providing professors &quot;the kind of job security that most other workers can only dream of&quot; counterbalances universities&#x27; inability to compete with the private sector: &quot;Universities, after all, are not corporations and cannot provide the kinds of financial remuneration that similarly educated individuals in other fields expect.&quot;. Furthermore, Schrecker continues, because research positions require extreme specialization, they must consolidate the frequency and intensity of performance evaluations across a given career, and they cannot have the same flexibility or turnover rates as other jobs, making the tenure process a practical necessity: &quot;A mathematician cannot teach a class on medieval Islam, nor can an art historian run an organic chemistry lab. Moreover, there is no way that the employing institution can provide the kind of retraining that would facilitate such a transformation... even the largest and most well-endowed institution lacks the resources to reevaluate and replace its medieval Islamicists and algebraic topologists every year. Tenure thus lets the academic community avoid excessive turnover while still ensuring the quality of the institution&#x27;s faculty. It is structured around two assessments -- one at hiring, the other some six years later -- that are far more rigorous than those elsewhere in society and give the institution enough confidence in the ability of the successful candidates to retain them on a permanent basis.&quot;

According to Skoble, tenure is essential because it protects academic freedom: not only in cases in which a scholar&#x27;s politics may run counter to those of their department, institution, or funding bodies, but also and most often in cases when a scholar&#x27;s work innovates in ways that challenge received wisdom in the field. While stating that it has flaws, she asserts that tenure plays a crucial role in preserving academic freedom.

Skoble argues categorically and plainly against critics that say &quot;tenure protects incompetent professors&quot;: &quot;My argument is that when this happens, it is a malfunction of the system, not an intrinsic feature of its proper use. The way it is supposed to work is that incompetent professors do not get tenure in the first place. The rebuttal is &#x27;but they do, therefore tenure is a bad idea.&#x27; But that is like arguing that because you ran a red light and caused a train wreck, driving is a bad idea.&quot;

According to Perry A. Zirkel, a professor specializing in education law, it is incorrect to blame tenure for the difficulty in firing bad teachers; regardless of tenure, firing a teacher has substantial costs and involves an extended process of hearings and documentation.

<text>Litherland is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside. Until 1899 it was within the historic county of Lancashire. It was an urban district, which included Seaforth and Ford. It neighbours Waterloo to the north, Seaforth to the west, and Bootle to the south and is approximately north of Liverpool city centre.

==History==

The name Litherland derives from two elements, Old Norse &quot;hlið&quot;/&quot;hlith-ar&quot;, which means &quot;slope&quot;, and Old English &quot;land&quot;, &quot;land&quot;.

Litherland was mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Liderlant&quot;, however there was no mention of Liverpool at that time. The first manor of Litherland consisted of one half and two quarters, the areas being Litherland including what is now Seaforth (the half) and present day Orrell and Ford (the two quarters).

Litherland remained a poor area until the arrival of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1774, this brought the area into the modern world, originally providing a safe route through Lancashire from Liverpool to Wigan, and eventually in 1816 through to Leeds. The route became very busy primarily for goods and later for the transportation of passengers. The outcome of all this activity was to bring prosperous businessmen from the city to the countryside, where they had a desire to live. The canal was crossed by a mechanical lifting bridge built in 1934 (replacing an earlier swing bridge) which was demolished in 1974.

The area was the northern extremity of the Bootle and North Docks lines of Liverpool&#x27;s tramway network. From the boundary with Bootle, it ran for ¾ of a mile along Linacre Road to a terminus at the junction with Bridge Road. This short stretch was the last horse drawn service in Liverpool, switching to electric operation in August 1903, eight months after the rest of the system converted.

The Litherland Gala was staged every year and was famous for the procession of shire horses and floats from the docks. The gala procession ended at the Bryant and May sports field.

Litherland Town Hall was officially opened in February 1941: The Beatles played some of their earliest gigs there in 1961.

==Governance==
For parliamentary elections, Litherland is within the Bootle constituency. The town is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Peter Dowd.

Litherland returns six members to Sefton Council from two electoral wards, each with three representatives. As of May 2023, the Litherland ward is represented by Patricia Hardy, John Kelly, and Paul Tweed; and the Ford ward&#x27;s representatives are Liz Dowd, Paulette Lappin and Ian Moncur. All six are members of the Labour Party.

==Education==
Primary schools in the area include Beach road primary school, Hatton Hill Primary School, English Martyrs&#x27; Catholic Primary School, Litherland Moss Primary School, Lander Road Primary School, Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Primary School, St Elizabeth&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and St Philip&#x27;s Church of England Controlled Primary School. Litherland High School is the main secondary school in the area, while Rowan Park School is a special school for 2 to 19 year-olds.

South Sefton College is a sixth form which serves students in Litherland as well as the wider southern part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada, the local television station TalkLiverpool also broadcasts to the area. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Merseyside, Heart North West, Capital Liverpool, Hits Radio Liverpool, Smooth North West, and Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;.

==Transport==
Litherland is served by Seaforth &amp; Litherland railway station on the Hunts Cross to Southport line of the Merseyrail network. The main road is the A5036 road, which connects to Switch Island and the A565 road at Seaforth Dock.

<doc id="314956" wikidata="Q7792576" url="?curid=314956" title="Thomas Morton (bishop)">
<text>Thomas Morton (20 March 156420 September 1659) was an English churchman, bishop of several dioceses. Well-connected and in favour with James I, he was also a significant polemical writer against Roman Catholic views. He rose to become Bishop of Durham, but despite a record of sympathetic treatment of Puritans as a diocesan, and underlying Calvinist beliefs shown in the Gagg controversy, his royalism saw him descend into poverty under the Commonwealth.

==Life==
Morton was born in York on 20 March 1564, the sixth of the nineteen children of Richard Morton, mercer, of York, and alderman of the city, by his wife Elizabeth All Saints&#x27; Church, Pavement, York. He was brought up and grammar school educated in the city and nearby Halifax. In 1582, he became a pensioner at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge from which he graduated with a BA in 1584 and an MA in 1590. William Whitaker picked him out for a Fellow of the college, and he proceeded to the degree of BD in 1598, and that of DD &#x27;with great distinction&#x27; in 1606.

Morton was ordained in 1592, and held the office of university lecturer in logic till in 1598 when he obtained the living of All Saints&#x27; Church, Long Marston, in Yorkshire. He was then chaplain to Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, Lord President of the North. In 1602, when the plague was raging at York, he devoted himself to the inmates of the pest-house. He conducted disputations with Roman Catholics; Herbert Croft, who became Bishop of Hereford, was claimed as Morton&#x27;s convert to the Church of England.

In 1602 he was selected, with Richard Crakanthorpe as his colleague, to accompany Ralph Eure, 3rd Baron Eure when sent by Elizabeth as ambassador extraordinary to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and Christian IV of Denmark. He made the acquaintance of foreign scholars and theologians, including Jesuits, and collected books at Frankfurt and elsewhere. He met Hugh Broughton, then residing at Middelburg, to whom he proposed scriptural difficulties. On Elizabeth&#x27;s death Morton returned to England, and became chaplain to Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland. He had time for theological writing, and residence at Belvoir Castle enabled him to consult the libraries of London.

==Dean==
Through Richard Bancroft&#x27;s recommendation Morton was appointed one of James I&#x27;s chaplains, and in 1606 became Dean of Gloucester, and, on the nomination of his former patron, Lord Eure, the lord president, member of the Council of the Marches. On accepting the deanery he offered to resign the living of Long Marston in favour of his friend John Donne, not yet in holy orders, but the offer was declined. In the same year he visited Oxford, where he was admitted to an &quot;ad eundem&quot; degree on 12 July. On this occasion he met eminent theologians, such as John King, John Rainolds, Henry Airey, and Daniel Featley.

In 1609 James I made him Dean of Winchester, where Thomas Bilson, who conferred on him the living of Alresford. At Winchester he became the intimate friend of Arthur Lake, then master of St. Cross, and of John Harmar, head-master of Winchester School. In 1610 he preached the sermon &quot;ad clerum&quot; at the opening of Convocation. When in London he lodged at the deanery of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with John Overall, in whose house he enjoyed the society of Isaac Casaubon, who became a friend; and met Abraham Scultetus, Giovanni Diodati, and Pierre Du Moulin. On Casaubon&#x27;s death in 1614 Morton had a monument erected to him in Westminster Abbey at his own cost. Among his associates from abroad at a later period were Friedrich Spanheim and Marco Antonio De Dominis.

In 1610 he was nominated to one of the seventeen fellowships in Chelsea College. Preferments then followed: in July of the same year he was collated by Tobias Matthew, Archbishop of York, to the canonry of Husthwait in York Minster. In 1615, on the death of George Lloyd, James I nominated him Bishop of Chester; his consecration was delayed until 7 July 1616. The ceremony, of unusual stateliness, was performed at Lambeth Palace by George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by Christopher Hampton, Archbishop of Armagh; Alexander Forbes, Bishop of Caithness; John King, Bishop of London; and John Overall, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. While the palace at Chester was readied he stayed with Christopher Hatton at Clay Hall, Essex, where he was seriously ill. He had resigned Alresford, but during his episcopate he held the living of Stopford, given him by James I &quot;in commendam&quot;.

==Bishop of Chester==
Morton&#x27;s see was large: Cheshire and Lancashire, the north-western portion of Yorkshire, and large parts of Cumberland and Westmoreland. Lancashire had a Catholic majority and Calvinist minority.
Two significant works came out of this period, in which Morton had to deal with local issues outside the grander scope of the allegiance oath controversy to which he had devoted his efforts.

Nicholas Byfield preached in Chester to a congregation including John Bruen. Morton tried to reason with his Puritanical clergy. His tenure as bishop coincided with a watershed moment in opinion, namely a changed view of the relative threat of Catholicism and Protestant nonconformity.

Sabbatarianism was at issue, with an attempt by the magistrates to suppress the diversions customary on Sunday afternoons. James I asked advice from Morton, who recommended: 
*that nothing should be permitted which might disturb the worshipers when engaged in divine service; that it should be left to each man&#x27;s conscience whether he should take part in the accustomed sports when service was over; that all parishioners were to attend their own parish church; and
*those who refused to do so were to be debarred from engaging in the subsequent diversions.

James based the substance of his subsequent declaration on these points; but his publication of the &quot;Book of Sports&quot; in the following year led to new disturbances. Morton&#x27;s own dealings with nonconformist clergy were marked by moderation.

==Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield==
In 1618, on John Overall&#x27;s translation to Norwich, Morton became Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, on the recommendation of Lancelot Andrewes. With the bishopric he held the living of Clifton Camville &quot;in commendam&quot;.
In 1621, he served on the commission for granting a dispensation to George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, for the casual homicide of a keeper in Bramshill Park.

In February 1626, he took a leading part in the York House Conference on Richard Montagu&#x27;s incriminated books. With John Preston, Morton did his best to impugn the statements contained in them on predestination and freewill.

==Bishop of Durham==
In June 1632, Morton became Bishop of Durham, which he held by canonical right until his death in 1659, although parliament claimed to deprive him of it in 1647. Complaints were later made against him to the House of Commons by his prebendary, Peter Smart. He showed forbearance in claiming the rights of the palatinate, was liberal in almsgiving, and maintained poor scholars at the universities. On his journey to Scotland in 1633, Charles I and his suite were received by Morton in princely style; six years later, in May 1639, he again entertained Charles at the beginning of the First Bishops&#x27; War. The next year, in the month of August, the Scots crossed the River Tweed, and pushed on to the city of Durham. The cathedral clergy fled, and Morton himself retired into Yorkshire.

Early in 1641 he was in London attending Parliament, and was nominated a member of the sub-committee to prepare matters for the consideration of the abortive committee of the lords appointed on 1 March—the day of William Laud&#x27;s committal to the Tower of London—to take cognisance of innovations in religion. In the following December a mob threatened to drag him out of his coach when on his way to the House of Lords. Morton never took his seat in the lords again. Two days later, 29 December, he joined in John Williams&#x27; protest against the legality of all acts done in the enforced absence of the spiritual lords. For this he and his 11 associates were next day impeached of high treason on William Prynne&#x27;s motion; and the same night they were all committed to the Tower, with the exception of Morton and the aged Robert Wright, Bishop of Lichfield, who were allowed to remain in the house of the usher of the black rod.

After four months&#x27; imprisonment Morton was released without a trial, and remained unmolested at Durham House, in The Strand, till April 1645, when he was again brought before the bar of the House of Commons on the charges of baptising the infant daughter of the Earl of Rutland according to the rites of the Church of England, and of refusing to surrender the seal of the County palatine of Durham. He was committed to the custody of the serjeant-at-arms for six months.

On the abolition of episcopacy in 1646 an annual income was assigned to him, but without indications of by whom it was to be paid not being specified. He obtained a sum of £1,000 from the committee at Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall, which he employed in paying his debts and purchasing an annuity. In 1648 he was driven from Durham House soldiers, who took forcible possession of it. He then resided with his friends, the Earl and Countess of Rutland, at Exeter House in The Strand; and the passed his time with royalist lay friends. Returning to London on horseback, he fell in with Christopher, son and heir of Henry Yelverton. Christopher did not recognise the bishop. To his inquiry who he was, Morton replied, &#x27;I am that old man, the Bishop of Durham, in spite of all your votes;&#x27; asked where he was going, his answer was, &#x27;To London, to live there a little while, and then to die.&#x27; Ultimately, Yelverton invited him to his house at Easton Maudit, ten miles from Northampton. Morton became a member of the family, and tutor to Henry, his eldest son.

At Easton Maudit, Morton held secret ordinations. Yelverton died in 1654. Morton died there on 22 September 1659. He was buried in the Yelverton chapel of the parish church. His chaplain, John Barwick, preached the funeral sermon. He died unmarried.

==Patronage==
Morton was a patron of learned men. At the beginning of the First English Civil War, he offered Thomas Fuller a home and maintenance. Isaac Basire was one of the scholars whom he brought forward. Ralph Brownrig, Henry Ferne and John Barwick were among his chaplains. He was a patron of foreign Reformed theologians, whom he received into his house and treated generously. He favoured the work of John Durie for reconciling Protestants. He numbered Richard Hooker among his friends as well as Hooker&#x27;s biographer Isaak Walton, who wrote of the information he derived from Morton. William Laud was one of his correspondents.

==Views==
In theology he belonged to the school of James Ussher and William Bedell, and had little sympathy with Laudianism. Richard Baxter speaks of him as &#x27;belonging to that class of episcopal divines who differ in nothing considerable from the rest of the reformed churches except in church government,&#x27; and Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon classes him with &#x27;the less formal and more popular prelates&#x27;. He was a sincere episcopalian, regarding ordination by presbyters valid in case of necessity, no such necessity however warranting it in the Church of England.

From the moderation of his ecclesiastical views he was at one time well regarded by William Prynne. Edmund Calamy recorded his liberal treatment of Puritans such as John Hieron, Richard Mather, and John Shawe of Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

His attitude towards the Roman Catholic Church was hostile; he was one of the only three bishops who, according to a statement made to Gregorio Panzani, the papal envoy, by Richard Montagu, were &#x27;counted violently bent against the Papists&#x27;. Morton corresponded with Sibrandus Lubbertus on matters concerning anti-papal polemic, and their views were close. Lubbertus was a leading contra-Remonstrant and Morton was one of his significant English supporters in the conflict over the appointment of Conrad Vorstius at the University of Leiden.

==Legacy==
One of Morton&#x27;s last acts before his death was to publish a denial that he had in a speech in the House of Lords acknowledged the fiction of the &quot;Nag&#x27;s Head Consecration&quot; of Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury. By his will he left money to the poor of the parish in which he died, and his chalice to All Saints, York, the parish in which he was born. He also bequeathed a silver-gilt chalice and paten of large size for the use of the chapel recently added to the manor-house by Henry Yelverton. A codicil to his will contained a declaration of his faith and of his adhesion to the Church of England.

In the 1680s Richard Baxter, who as a schoolboy received confirmation from Morton in Durham, called him &quot;one of the learnedest and best bishops that ever I knew&quot;.

==Works==
He gained a reputation as a Protestant controversialist, and published numerous works against Roman Catholicism, prominent among them being the &quot;Apologia catholica&quot; (1605) and &quot;A Catholicke Appeale&quot; (1609).

Morton&#x27;s major works were:

* &#x27;Apologia Catholica, ex meris Jesuitarum contradictionibus conflata,&#x27; &amp;c., part 1, London [1605–1606]. John Donne may have assisted him in this work.
* &#x27;An Exact Discoverie of Romish Doctrine in the case of Conspiracie and Rebellion,&#x27; &amp;c., 1605.
* &#x27;Apologiæ Catholicæ, in qua parodoxa, hæreses, blasphemiæ, scelera, quæ Jesuitæ et Pontificii alii Protestantibus impingunt, fere omnia, ex ipsorum Pontificiorum testimoniis apertis diluuntur, libri duo. De notis Ecclesiæ Editio castigatior,&#x27; 2pts. London, 1606.
* &#x27;A Full Satisfaction concerning a Double Romish Iniquitie, hainous Rebellion, and more than heathenish Æquivocation. Containing three parts,&#x27; London, 1606.
* &#x27;A Preamble unto an Incounter with P. R. (R. Parsons), the Author of the deceitfull Treatise of Mitigation: concerning the Romish Doctrine both in question of Rebellion and of Aequivocation,&#x27; London, 1608.
* &#x27;A Catholic Appeal for Protestants, out of the Confessions of the Romane Doctors; particularly answering the misnamed Catholike Apologie for the Romane Faith, out of the Protestants [by J. Brereley],&#x27; London, 1610.
* &quot;A Direct Answer unto the scandalous Exceptions which T. Higgons hath lately objected against D. Morton [i.e. against his &quot;Apologia Catholica&quot;]. In which there is principally discussed two of the most notorious Objections used by the Romanists, viz.: (1) Martin Luther&#x27;s Conference with the Divell; and (2) The Sence of the Article of Christ, His Discension into Hell (Animadversions)&quot;, London, 1609. Against Theophilus Higgons. Higgons was writing at this time from a Catholic point of view; the work was an animadversion on a passage of his. Where Higgons argued that the Descensus controversy was more important than matter of clerical dress for which nonconformists were deprived, Morton argued that Catholic teaching on that matter was unclear, as based on scripture or patristics.
* &#x27;The Encounter against M. Parsons, by a Review of his last Sober Reckoning and his Exceptions urged in the Treatise of his Mitigation ...,&#x27; London, 1610.
* &#x27;A Defence of the Innocencie of the Three Ceremonies of the Church of England, viz., the Surplice, Crosse after Baptisme, and Kneeling at the Receiving of the Blessed Sacrament&#x27;, London, 1618. This work arose out of Morton&#x27;s diocesan dealings with Puritans, and in it Morton argued that deprivals of nonconforming clergy only took place for obstinate and public opposition to church doctrine over extended periods.William Hinde argued that the surplice was not Biblical, and that ceremonies should be matters indifferent. Robert Nicholls of Wrenbury had written a treatise against kneeling for Morton, printed later in 1660. Kneeling had formed one of the matters over which clergy of the diocese of Lincoln had petitioned James I in 1604 for change in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in 1604; an abridged form of the petition was circulating in 1617 as a book printed covertly in Leiden by William Jones.
* &#x27;Causa Regia, sive De Authoritate et Dignitate principum Christianorum adversus R. Bellarminum,&#x27; 1620.
* &#x27;The Grand Imposture of the (now) Church of Rome manifested in this one Article of the new Romane Creede, viz., &quot;The Holy Catholike and Apostolike Romane Church, Mother and Mistresse of all other Churches, without which there is no salvation.&quot; The second edition, revised ... with ... Additions,&#x27; London, 1628.

O-substituted oximes form a closely related family of compounds. Amidoximes are oximes of amides () with general structure .

Oximes are usually generated by the reaction of hydroxylamine with aldehydes () or ketones (). The term &quot;oxime&quot; dates back to the 19th century, a combination of the words &quot;oxygen&quot; and &quot;imine&quot;.

==Structure and properties==
If the two side-chains on the central carbon are different from each other—either an aldoxime, or a ketoxime with two different &quot;R&quot; groups—the oxime can often have two different geometric stereoisomeric forms according to the &quot;E&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; configuration. An older terminology of &quot;syn&quot; and &quot;anti&quot; was used to identify especially aldoximes according to whether the R group was closer or further from the hydroxyl. Both forms are often stable enough to be separated from each other by standard techniques.

Oximes have three characteristic bands in the infrared spectrum, whose wavelengths corresponding to the stretching vibrations of its three types of bonds: 3600 cm−1 (O−H), 1665 cm−1 (C=N) and 945 cm−1 (N−O).

In aqueous solution, aliphatic oximes are 102- to 103-fold more resistant to hydrolysis than analogous hydrazones.

==Preparation==
Oximes can be synthesized by condensation of an aldehyde or a ketone with hydroxylamine. The condensation of aldehydes with hydroxylamine gives aldoximes, and ketoximes are produced from ketones and hydroxylamine. In general, oximes exist as colorless crystals or as thick liquids and are poorly soluble in water. Therefore, oxime formation can be used for the identification of ketone or aldehyde functional groups.

Oximes can also be obtained from reaction of nitrites such as isoamyl nitrite with compounds containing an acidic hydrogen atom. Examples are the reaction of ethyl acetoacetate and sodium nitrite in acetic acid, the reaction of methyl ethyl ketone with ethyl nitrite in hydrochloric acid. and a similar reaction with propiophenone, the reaction of phenacyl chloride, the reaction of malononitrile with sodium nitrite in acetic acid

A conceptually related reaction is the Japp–Klingemann reaction.

==Reactions==
The hydrolysis of oximes proceeds easily by heating in the presence of various inorganic acids, and the oximes decompose into the corresponding ketones or aldehydes, and hydroxylamines. The reduction of oximes by sodium metal, sodium amalgam, hydrogenation, or reaction with hydride reagents produces amines. Typically the reduction of aldoximes gives both primary amines and secondary amines; however, reaction conditions can be altered (such as the addition of potassium hydroxide in a 1/30 molar ratio) to yield solely primary amines.
In general, oximes can be changed to the corresponding amide derivatives by treatment with various acids. This reaction is called Beckmann rearrangement. In this reaction, a hydroxyl group is exchanged with the group that is in the anti position of the hydroxyl group. The amide derivatives that are obtained by Beckmann rearrangement can be transformed into a carboxylic acid by means of hydrolysis (base or acid catalyzed). Beckmann rearrangement is used for the industrial synthesis of caprolactam (see applications below).

The Ponzio reaction (1906) concerning the conversion of &quot;m&quot;-nitrobenzaldoxime to &quot;m&quot;-nitrophenyldinitromethane using dinitrogen tetroxide was the result of research into TNT analogues:

Gentler oxidants give mono-nitro compounds. 

In the Neber rearrangement certain oximes are converted to the corresponding alpha-amino ketones.

Oximes can be dehydrated using acid anhydrides to yield corresponding nitriles.

Certain amidoximes react with benzenesulfonyl chloride to make substituted ureas in the Tiemann rearrangement:


==Uses==
In their largest application, an oxime is an intermediate in the industrial production of caprolactam, a precursor to Nylon 6. About half of the world&#x27;s supply of cyclohexanone, more than a million tonnes annually, is converted to the oxime. In the presence of sulfuric acid catalyst, the oxime undergoes the Beckmann rearrangement to give the cyclic amide caprolactam:

===Metal extractant===

Oximes are commonly used as ligands and sequestering agents for metal ions. Dimethylglyoxime (dmgH2) is a reagent for the analysis of nickel and a popular ligand in its own right. In the typical reaction, a metal reacts with two equivalents of dmgH2 concomitant with ionization of one proton. Salicylaldoxime is a chelator in hydrometallurgy.

Amidoximes such as polyacrylamidoxime can be used to capture trace amounts of uranium from sea water. In 2017 researchers announced a configuration that absorbed up to nine times as much uranyl as previous fibers without saturating.

===Other applications===
* Oxime compounds are used as antidotes for nerve agents. A nerve agent inactivates acetylcholinesterase by phosphorylation. Oxime compounds can reactivate acetylcholinesterase by attaching to phosphorus, forming an oxime-phosphonate, which then splits away from the acetylcholinesterase molecule. Oxime nerve-agent antidotes are pralidoxime (also known as 2-PAM), obidoxime, methoxime, HI-6, Hlo-7, and TMB-4. The effectiveness of the oxime treatment depends on the particular nerve agent used.
* Perillartine, the oxime of perillaldehyde, is used as an artificial sweetener in Japan. It is 2000 times sweeter than sucrose.
* Diaminoglyoxime is a key precursor to various compounds containing the highly reactive furazan ring.
* Methyl ethyl ketoxime is a skin-preventing additive in many oil-based paints.
* Buccoxime and 5-methyl-3-heptanone oxime (&quot;Stemone&quot;) are perfume ingredients.
*Fluvoxamine is used as an antidepressant.

<text>Herbert Kroemer (; August 25, 1928 – March 8, 2024) was a German-American physicist who, along with Zhores Alferov, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for &quot;developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and opto-electronics&quot;. Kroemer was professor emeritus of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, having received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1952 from the University of Göttingen, Germany, with a dissertation on hot electron effects in the then-new transistor. His research into transistors was a stepping stone to the later development of mobile phone technologies.

==Early life==
Born to a working-class family in Weimar, Germany, Kroemer excelled in physics at school, letting him advance faster than his peers in the subject.

==Career==
Kroemer worked in a number of research laboratories in Germany and the United States and taught electrical engineering at the University of Colorado from 1968 to 1976. He joined the UCSB faculty in 1976, focusing its semiconductor research program on the emerging compound semiconductor technology rather than on mainstream silicon technology. Charles Kittel had published the successful &quot;Thermal Physics&quot; in 1969, and enlisted Kroemer to edit it for a second edition, which appeared in 1980.

He is also the author of the textbook &quot;Quantum Mechanics for Engineering, Materials Science and Applied Physics&quot;.

Kroemer was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering in 1997 for conception of the semiconductor heterostructure transistor and laser, and for leadership in semiconductor materials technology. He was also elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2003.

Kroemer always preferred to work on problems that are ahead of mainstream technology, inventing the drift transistor in the 1950s and being the first to point out that advantages could be gained in various semiconductor devices by incorporating heterojunctions. Most notably, though, in 1963 he proposed the concept of the double-heterostructure laser, which is now a central concept in the field of semiconductor lasers. Kroemer became an early pioneer in molecular beam epitaxy, concentrating on applying the technology to untried new materials.

== Personal life ==
Kroemer was an atheist. He died on March 8, 2024, at the age of 95.

==Awards and honors==

<doc id="314965" wikidata="Q2569221" url="?curid=314965" title="Formby">
<text>Formby is a town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England.

Historically in Lancashire, three manors are recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 under &quot;Fornebei&quot;, Halsall, Walton and Poynton. Cockle raking and shrimp fishing lasted into the 19th century. By 1872, the township and sub-district was made up of two chapelries (St Peter&#x27;s and St Luke&#x27;s), Birkdale township, the hamlets of Ainsdale and Raven-Meols and Altcar parish. Formby was built on the plain adjoining the Irish Sea coast a few miles north of the Crosby channel.

A commuter town for Liverpool, Formby is also a tourist destination with day trippers attracted to its beaches, sand dunes and wildlife, particularly the endangered red squirrel and natterjack toad. The area is conserved by the National Trust, and designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

== History ==
Erosion of sand on the beach at Formby is revealing layers of mud and sediment, laid down in the late Mesolithic to the late Neolithic, approximately 8,000 – 5,000 years ago, and covered in the early Bronze Age. These sediments often contain the footprints of humans and animals (red deer, roe deer, wild boar, wolf, aurochs) and birds (oystercatcher, crane and other waders) from that period. In June 2016, over 50 human footprints from 7,000 years ago were uncovered on the beach.

The common place-name suffix &quot;-by&quot; is from the Scandinavian &quot;byr&quot; meaning &quot;homestead&quot;, &quot;settlement&quot; or &quot;village&quot;. The village of Formby was originally spelt &quot;Fornebei&quot; and means &quot;the old settlement&quot; or &quot;village belonging to Forni&quot;. At that time &quot;Fornibiyum&quot; was also a well-known Norse family name. He could have been the leader of the invading expedition which took possession of this coast. Until its closure in 1998, Oslo Airport in Norway was situated in a town called Fornebu.

It was from Ireland in about 960 AD that these Norsemen or Vikings first came to the west coast of Lancashire, initially trading or raiding and then settling. Tradition says that the Viking invaders failed to defeat the native Anglo-Saxons on the coast of Formby, so they sailed inland, up the River Alt, and attacked from the rear. Dangus Lane, on the east side of the village, is sometimes called Danesgate Land, being connected by local traditions with this incursion.

Formby Hall is a Grade II listed building dating back to 1223. It has traditionally been the home of the lords of the manor. Much of the land around it is now a golf course.

Formby Beach is the location of the first lifeboat station in the UK. It is believed to have been established as early as 1776 by William Hutchinson, the Dock Master for the Liverpool Common Council. Although no exact record has been found, the boat used is believed to have been a &#x27;Mersey Gig&#x27;. The last launch from the station took place in 1916. Remarkably, a film of this event survived. The foundations of the last of the lifeboat station buildings remain on the beach to this day. In 2016, the newly opened Wetherspoons pub in the town was named &#x27;The Lifeboat&#x27; in honour of the original lifeboat station.

Formby is home to RAF Woodvale, a small RAF station to the north of the town. The airfield opened in 1941 and is a former Second World War fighter station with three active runways, the main runway being a mile in length. Today it is used by RAF for light aircraft and fighter training, as well as a few civilian aircraft. The station was also home to Merseyside Police&#x27;s helicopter, known as &#x27;Mike One&#x27;. The RAF station was also home to the last operational service of WWII fighter plane the Supermarine Spitfire. In 1957 the last Spitfire to fly operationally with British military markings took off from RAF Woodvale. Woodvale is also home to the Woodvale Rally, one of the biggest shows on an active MOD station in the North West.

==Governance==
Until 1974, Formby was an urban district (Formby Urban District) within the administrative county of Lancashire. Since 1 April 1974, it has formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, in Merseyside.

Prior to 1983 Formby was in the parliamentary constituency of Ormskirk and after Ormskirk&#x27;s abolition was made part of the Crosby constituency. The Member of Parliament (MP) for Crosby from 1997 until 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party, prior to her election the seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election when Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency.

As a result of the Crosby constituency being abolished for the 2010 general election, Formby is part of the newly created Sefton Central constituency, represented by Bill Esterson, a member of the Labour Party. Sefton Central is now considered a safe Labour seat.

For elections to Sefton Council, Formby is divided between two electoral wards with three councillors each. As of May 2023, Harington ward, whose councillors are Peter Harvey (Labour), Carol Richards (Labour) and Joe Riley (Conservative); and Ravenmeols ward, whose councillors are Catie Page (Labour), Christopher Page (Labour) and Nina Killen (Labour). Locally Formby is governed by Formby Parish Council.

==Geography==
Formby is a coastal town, with an area of roughly 7 sq miles (17 km2), located in the borough of Sefton. The town is built upon the west of a large flat area of land called the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. Formby&#x27;s highest point is within the sand dunes that separate the Irish Sea from Formby. However, these sand dunes are ever-changing in shape and formation, so there is no fixed point. 

The land between Formby and the areas of Southport, Ormskirk and Liverpool is green belt land and is mostly used for arable agricultural purposes. The areas around the urban fringe are drained by irrigation ditches and open areas get boggy in the winter months. Earth in urban areas is well drained, very loose and sandy.

The section of land between Formby and the coast is varied in vegetation, wildlife and terrain. This area includes pine forests (both natural and man-made), sand dunes, marram grass, deciduous woodland, seasonal ponds and lakes. Large areas of this land are protected by the National Trust. The southern boundary of the town partially follows the course of the River Alt which enters the Irish Sea just south of Formby at Hightown.

Formby is in a temperate climate zone, with mild winters and warm summers. Formby&#x27;s coastline faces an ongoing threat from water-based erosion, with high tides washing away yards of sand dunes. In an attempt to stem this, in some years discarded Christmas trees are collected and planted by rangers and volunteers to help slow this effect.

==Economy==
The main shopping area is known locally as &#x27;The village&#x27;, in which the town upholds an array of shops including a Boots, Card Factory and Savers, alongside some independent outlets. The majority of these shops are located along the streets of Chapel Lane and Brows Lane, which also contains a number of coffee houses, including Costa Coffee and Cafe Nero, banks, travel agents, estate agents and charity shops. This tree-lined Avenue runs for about a third of a mile, with shops either side of it. &#x27;The village&#x27; further branches out onto Elbow Lane, Three Tuns Lane, Halsall Lane and School Lane, where more shops are located.

There are several other smaller shopping areas around Formby and Freshfield, mostly convenience stores and specialist outlets, such as an optician and a model shop. Formby also has a main post office and two smaller post offices.

The town has several supermarkets including a Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s SimplyFood, Waitrose and Iceland. Formby has no major industries; however, there is a small industrial estate on the outskirts of the town, on which a McDonald&#x27;s is located. A recent study of the town showed that between 10%–30% of its residents commute to either Liverpool or Southport 

===Tourism===

Formby has a significant tourist industry, most notably between the warmer months of May and September. In particular, it is popular with day trippers from across the North West. There are two main spots along the Formby Coast which are particularly popular with the public.

The Lifeboat Road site is about 1½ miles from the town centre; there are three linked unpaved car parks with several routes cascading out into the sand dunes and woods. The car parks are about 900 yards from the beach and there is a charge to park there.

Victoria Road is north of Lifeboat Road and is busier due to the red squirrel reserve being located here, as well as it being the starting point for the asparagus trail. The reserve begins at the junction of Larkhill Lane and Victoria Road. Like Lifeboat Road, there is a charge to park from this point onwards. Parking is available adjacent to the reserve and at the end of the road, there is a large unpaved car park for easier beach access. The beach is located approximately 100 yards from the car park.

There is a privately run caravan park called Formby Point Caravan Park on Lifeboat Road, open between March and October. There are around 300 caravans on the park and 20 plots for touring caravans. There is a phone box, public toilet and a play area on site and, until 1995, there was a small convenience store. Additionally, there is a smaller caravan site called Freshfield Caravan Park.

==Transport==
Formby Bypass (A565) was built during 1936-37 to take the major Liverpool to Southport route out of Formby and cut alongside the fringe of the town. The bypass is a dual carriageway with two roundabouts and three sets of traffic lights. It has been the scene of many accidents, some fatal and there are calls from some for the scrapping of a proposed motorway link as a result. The B5195 links Formby with Ormskirk and Maghull. Motorways are easily accessible, the M58 and M57 are both 6 miles from Formby..

There are two railway stations: Formby railway station and, less than a mile north, Freshfield railway station. Both are on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network, which has traditionally run from Hunts Cross to Southport. However, from August 25, 2024 this service now terminates at Liverpool Central, with the Hunt&#x27;s Cross service now running to Ormskirk.
Trains are frequent (typically every 15 minutes) and are a popular way of commuting, especially to the city centre of Liverpool.

Bus services in the town are provided by Arriva North West, Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire from Preston Depot and Merseytravel. These include services to Southport, Ince Blundell, Liverpool, Southport and Formby District General Hospital and Merseytravel&#x27;s Formby circular routes.

The nearest commercial airport is in Liverpool which is 17 miles away. Manchester Airport is 36 miles away. Liverpool Airport is reachable using Liverpool&#x27;s suburban railway network, Merseyrail, via Liverpool South Parkway.

London is under two hours away via train from Runcorn railway station which is 25 miles / 45 minutes drive from Formby, or from Liverpool Lime Street railway station which is 11 miles / 30 minutes drive.

In addition to motorised transport, Formby is served by excellent cycle routes, mainly centring on the pinewoods along the coast leading to both Southport and Liverpool. There are also many cycle lanes on the roads leading to the larger conurbations to the north and south.

==Education==

There are seven primary schools in Formby, namely Woodlands, Redgate CP, Our Lady of Compassion RC, St Jerome&#x27;s RC, Trinity St Peters C. of E., Freshfield CP and St Luke&#x27;s C. of E. Trinity St Peter&#x27;s C. of E. in Formby is the amalgamation of two former primary schools – St Peter&#x27;s and Holy Trinity – the latter of which closed in July 2006. The school was formed as part of a major reorganisation of primary education in Sefton. Raven Meols Primary School also closed as a school and is now used as a Community Centre.

Formby has two large high schools, Formby High School and Range High School and also had an independent high school focussing on Educational and Behaviour difficulties teaching, Clarence House. The independent school was permanently closed as of 2018 and residential units demolished. Clarence House was owned by Nugent Care, a registered charity, who also governs Clumber Lodge, a children&#x27;s home in Formby.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Merseyside, Heart North West, Hits Radio Liverpool, Smooth North West, Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West, and Dune Radio, a community based station. 

The town is served by these local newspapers:
* Southport Visiter (formerly Formsby Times) 
* Southport Reporter
* Liverpool Echo

==Scouting==
Formby has a long tradition of scouting dating back to 1909, just over a year after Baden Powell&#x27;s legendary experimental camp on Brownsea Island in Dorset in 1907. The first Scout group in the town, named the 1st Formby, was set up at Holy Trinity Church Hall by Mr Murray Spense. There are currently a handful of active groups out of the nine that were initially set up over the last century, especially since the 1960s housing estates expanded the town.

Scouts can be seen marching through the village every year on St George&#x27;s Day.

==Wildlife==
To the west of the town lie pinewoods and sand dunes. The whole of the coastline here is managed as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) for its important wildlife reserves by Sefton Coast Partnership. The pine woods at Victoria Road have been established as a National Trust reserve for the red squirrel, listed on the endangered species list. Formby is one of several sites in Britain where the red squirrel can still be found although it is now being threatened by the grey squirrel.

Formby is also notable for the presence of natterjack toads. Formby is only one of a few sites in England where they will breed. Later in the evening the male&#x27;s distinctive song can be heard and is known locally as the &#x27;Bootle Organ&#x27;. In spring the males gather at the edge of shallow pools in the dune slacks and sing to attract a mate.

==Sport==
This stretch of coast is famous for links golf courses such as Southport &amp; Ainsdale, Hillside, West Lancashire, Hesketh and Royal Birkdale. Formby is home to another championship quality golf course – Formby Golf Club. However, the club, unlike its neighbour Royal Birkdale, does not have the capacity to host large events such as The Open Championship. Formby has a cricket club based down Cricket Path in Freshfield that plays in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition; this also has squash courts and a large AstroTurf hockey pitch.

The town also had a football team called Formby F.C. who played in the North West Counties Football League First Division. They played at Altcar Road, behind Tesco just off the A565 Formby Bypass, having moved in the summer of 2002 from their town centre home at Brows Lane. That site is now occupied by Formby Pool which opened on 27 January 2007. The biggest game in the club&#x27;s history was in November 1973 when they faced Oldham Athletic in the First Round of the F.A Cup.

In addition, a variety of youth sporting groups are based in Formby. These include Formby Junior Sports Club (FJSC) known locally as &quot;Rourke&#x27;s League&quot; after Jim Rourke MBE (1912–2006) who founded the club on 2 January 1959. Rourke continued to attend the club into his 90s. Over 600 children ranging in age from 5 to 16 years meet at Deansgate Lane Playing Fields to play football at various times throughout Saturday mornings during the football season. The club welcomes children of all abilities, there are no trials or criteria to meet; every member plays every week. The club also fields numerous representative teams in local junior leagues (e.g. the Craven Minor League). Formby is also home to Formby Dons Football Club, who operate 3 teams, playing their home games at Duke Street Park. In 2007, Formby Vikings Rugby Union Team was established to include a wide range of ages including a colts first 15 team.

<text>Yellowjacket or yellowjacket is the common name in North America for predatory social wasps of the genera &quot;Vespula&quot; and &quot;Dolichovespula&quot;. Members of these genera are known simply as &quot;wasps&quot; in other English-speaking countries. Most of these are black and yellow like the eastern yellowjacket (&quot;Vespula maculifrons&quot;) and the aerial yellowjacket (&quot;Dolichovespula arenaria&quot;); some are black and white like the bald-faced hornet (&quot;Dolichovespula maculata&quot;). Some have an abdomen with a red background color instead of black. They can be identified by their distinctive markings, their occurrence only in colonies, and a characteristic, rapid, side-to-side flight pattern prior to landing. All females are capable of stinging. Yellowjackets are important predators of pest insects.

== Identification ==
Yellowjackets may be confused with other wasps, such as hornets and paper wasps such as &quot;Polistes dominula&quot;. A typical yellowjacket worker is about long, with alternating bands on the abdomen; the queen is larger, about long (the different patterns on their abdomens help separate various species).

Yellowjackets are sometimes mistakenly called &quot;bees&quot; (as in &quot;meat bees&quot;), given that they are similar in size and general coloration to honey bees. In contrast to honey bees, yellowjackets have yellow or white markings, are not covered with tan-brown dense hair on their bodies, and do not have the flattened, hairy pollen-carrying hind legs characteristic of honey bees (although they are capable of pollination).

Yellowjackets have lance-like stingers with small barbs, and typically sting repeatedly, though occasionally a stinger becomes lodged and pulls free of the wasp&#x27;s body; the venom, like most bee and wasp venoms, is primarily dangerous to only those humans who are allergic or are stung many times. All species have yellow or white on their faces. Their mouthparts are well-developed with strong mandibles for capturing and chewing insects, with probosces for sucking nectar, fruit, and other juices. Yellowjackets build nests in trees, shrubs, or in protected places such as inside man-made structures, or in soil cavities, tree stumps, mouse burrows, etc. They build them from wood fiber they chew into a paper-like pulp. Many other insects exhibit protective mimicry of aggressive, stinging yellowjackets; in addition to numerous bees and wasps (Müllerian mimicry), the list includes some flies, moths, and beetles (Batesian mimicry).

Yellowjackets&#x27; closest relatives, the hornets, closely resemble them but have larger heads, seen especially in the large distance from the eyes to the back of the head.
== Life cycle and habits ==



Yellowjackets are social hunters living in colonies containing workers, queens, and males (drones). Colonies are annual with only inseminated queens overwintering. Fertilized queens are found in protected places such as in hollow logs, stumps, under bark, leaf litter, soil cavities, and man-made structures. Queens emerge during the warm days of late spring or early summer, select a nest site, and build a small paper nest in which they lay eggs. After eggs hatch from the 30 to 50 brood cells, the queen feeds the young larvae for about 18 to 20 days. Larvae pupate, then emerge later as small, infertile females called workers. Workers in the colony take over caring for the larvae, feeding them with chewed-up meat or fruit. By midsummer, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of nest expansion, foraging for food, care of the queen and larvae, and colony defense.

From this time until her death in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, reaching a maximum size of 4,000–5,000 workers and a nest of 10,000–15,000 cells in late summer. The species &quot;V. squamosa&quot;, in the southern part of its range, may build much larger perennial colonies populated by dozens of queens, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of thousands of cells. At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves to overwinter. Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places to overwinter. Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the founding queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment.

The adult yellowjacket diet consists primarily of sugars and carbohydrates, such as fruits, flower nectar, and tree sap. Larvae feed on proteins derived from insects, meats, and fish. Workers collect, chew, and condition such foods before feeding them to the larvae. Many of the insects collected by the workers are considered pest species, making the yellowjacket beneficial to agriculture. Larvae, in return, secrete a sugary substance for workers to eat; this exchange is a form of trophallaxis. As insect sources of food diminish in late summer, larvae produce less for workers to eat. Foraging workers pursue sources of sugar outside the nest including ripe fruits and human garbage.

== Notable species ==
*Two of the European yellowjacket species, the German wasp (&quot;Vespula germanica&quot;), and the common wasp (&quot;Vespula vulgaris&quot;) were originally native to Europe, but are now established as invasives in southern Africa, New Zealand, eastern Australia, and South America.
*The North American yellowjacket (&quot;Vespula alascensis&quot;), eastern yellowjacket (&quot;Vespula maculifrons&quot;), western yellowjacket (&quot;Vespula pensylvanica&quot;), and prairie yellowjacket (&quot;Vespula atropilosa&quot;) are native to North America.
*Southern yellowjacket (&quot;Vespula squamosa&quot;), a species that is sometimes free-living and sometimes a social parasite
*Bald-faced hornets (&quot;Dolichovespula maculata&quot;) belong among the yellowjackets rather than the true hornets. They are not usually called &quot;yellowjackets&quot; because of their ivory-on-black coloration.
*Aerial yellowjacket (&quot;Dolichovespula arenaria&quot;)
*Tree wasp (&quot;Dolichovespula sylvestris&quot;)

== Nest ==
&quot;Dolichovespula&quot; species such as the aerial yellowjacket, &quot;D. arenaria&quot;, and the bald-faced hornet, tend to create exposed aerial nests. This feature is shared with some true hornets, which has led to some naming confusion.

&quot;Vespula&quot; species, in contrast, build concealed nests, usually underground.

Yellowjacket nests usually last for only one season, dying off in winter. The nest is started by a single queen, called the &quot;foundress&quot;. Typically, a nest can reach the size of a basketball by the end of a season. In parts of Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, and southern coastal areas of the United States, the winters are mild enough to allow nest overwintering. Nests that survive multiple seasons become massive and often possess multiple egg-laying queens.

== In the United States ==
The German yellowjacket (&quot;V. germanica&quot;) first appeared in Ohio in 1975, and has now become the dominant species over the eastern yellowjacket. It is bold and aggressive and can sting repeatedly and painfully. It will mark aggressors and pursue them. It is often confused with &quot;Polistes dominula&quot;, another invasive species in the United States, due to their very similar pattern. The German yellowjacket builds its nests in cavities—not necessarily underground—with the peak worker population in temperate areas between 1000 and 3000 individuals between May and August. Each colony produces several thousand new reproductives after this point through November.

The eastern yellowjacket builds its nests underground, also with the peak worker population between 1000 and 3000 individuals, similar to the German yellowjacket. Nests are built entirely of wood fiber and are completely enclosed except for a small entrance at the bottom. The color of the paper is highly dependent on the source of the wood fibers used. The nests contain multiple, horizontal tiers of combs within. Larvae hang within the combs.

In the southeastern United States, where southern yellowjacket (&quot;Vespula squamosa&quot;) nests may persist through the winter, colony sizes of this species may reach 100,000 adult wasps. The same kind of nest expansion has occurred in Hawaii with the invasive western yellowjacket (&quot;V. pensylvanica&quot;).

== In popular culture ==
The yellowjacket&#x27;s most visible place in US sporting culture is as a mascot, most famously with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, represented by the mascot Buzz. Other college and university examples include Allen University, the American International College, Baldwin-Wallace University, Black Hills State University, Cedarville University, Defiance College, Graceland University, Howard Payne University, LeTourneau University, Montana State University Billings, Northern Vermont University-Lyndon, Randolph-Macon College, University of Rochester, University of Wisconsin–Superior, West Virginia State University, and Waynesburg University.

Though not specified by the team, the mascot of the Columbus Blue Jackets, named &quot;Stinger,&quot; closely resembles a yellowjacket. In the years since its original yellow incarnation, the mascot&#x27;s color has been changed to light green, seemingly combining the real insect&#x27;s yellow and the team&#x27;s blue.

In the United Kingdom the rugby union team Wasps RFC traditionally used a yellowjacket as their club emblem.

The Marvel Comics character Yellowjacket, who is based on the insect, is one of the various identities adopted by Hank Pym, who is most commonly known as Ant-Man. In addition to being able to fly, emit bio-electrictry inspired by a yellowjacket&#x27;s sting, and shrink down to insect size, Yellowjacket can also control the insect and uses them to aid him in various ways.

The television series, &quot;Yellowjackets&quot;, features a girls’ soccer team which gets stranded in the wilderness and resorts to extreme measures to survive. Their mascot is a Yellowjacket, and the theme song features images of the insect as well.

Note that yellowjacket is often spelled as two words (yellow jacket) in popular culture and even in some dictionaries. The proper entomological spelling, according to the Entomological Society of America, is as a single word (yellowjacket).

<text>The South Yorkshire Supertram, sometimes referred to as the Sheffield Supertram, is a tram and tram-train network covering Sheffield and Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England. The network is owned and operated by the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (SYMCA).

Interest in building a modern tram system for Sheffield had mounted during the 1980s. After detailed planning by South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE), the Supertram proposal was approved by an act of Parliament in 1991. Construction of the network, incorporating several existing heavy rail sections as well as new track, was carried out in sections, allowing revenue services to start during 1994. Early operations, hindered by a complex ticketing system and the initially small coverage area, had disappointing ridership figures. In an effort to turn around the performance, operations were privatised to Stagecoach in 1997, at price of £1.15 million, who took over from South Yorkshire Supertram Limited. After management and operational changes, and further expansion of the system, ridership numbers rose considerably. In March 2024, the network returned to public ownership as the concession awarded to Stagecoach came to an end.

From 2008, interest had been expressed in hybrid tram-train operations, which would be able to use sections of the mainline rail network as well as tramways. During 2012 an experimental trial was planned, as this was to be the first deployment of tram-trains anywhere in the United Kingdom. The start of tram-train operations, using a purpose-built fleet of new Class 399 Stadler Citylink electric multiple units, was repeatedly delayed, but on 25 October 2018, operations of the new tram-train line commenced.

The Supertram network now consists of 50 stations across four colour-coded lines, the Blue, Purple, Yellow and Tram-Train (Black) routes, which connect with local and national bus and rail services and six park and ride sites.

==History==
===Background and initial launch===

In common with many British cities, Sheffield used to have an extensive tram network, the Sheffield Tramway (1873–1960). This finally closed in October 1960, it then being argued that motorised buses offered superior economics.

The new Supertram network arose from ambitions held by the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE), which had been assigned the role of public transport co-ordination in the area. SYPTE refined an earlier and more expansive light rail proposal to include pre-existing heavy rail alignments, in order to gain the required permissions to proceed, and deposited several Bills to Parliament in 1985–1990 to gain the necessary powers. Financial approval was given by the Department of Transport towards the end of 1990, allowing the £240 million construction of the initial line to commence in 1991.

This line was opened in stages between 1994 and 1995. The first section, located along a former heavy rail alignment to Meadowhall, opened on 21 March 1994. The network was operated by South Yorkshire Supertram Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary company of SYPTE established to run the venture.

In the early years, the scheme was viewed by some as a failure; passengers continued using cheaper and more frequent buses, and retailers complained about the disruption caused by the lengthy construction works. The complex ticketing system was also a source of irritation and confusion to passengers. It became clear that projections for passenger numbers had been overly optimistic, and concern arose that the system represented poor value for money. The matter of who should bear the cost became an issue.

===Review and privatisation===

By 1996, the councils backing the Supertram brought in consultants to draw up options to address major operational and managerial problems. In December 1997, South Yorkshire Supertram Limited was privatised, and sold to Stagecoach for £1.15 million, substantially below the anticipated £80 million that the councils had hoped to raise to help pay off the accumulated debts, leaving several local councils with the long-term debt for the Supertram&#x27;s establishment. Under the terms of the deal struck by the Labour government, a reduction in operating costs was achieved, but it was calculated that the people of South Yorkshire were each paying 5p per week for the Supertram, which continued over many years. Stagecoach acquired the concession for the maintenance and operation of the Supertram network until 2024.

===Increasing use – and decline===
There were initially plans for Supertram to extend services to a greater area of South Yorkshire, such as lines to Barnsley and Doncaster, but progress has been restricted. According to &quot;BBC News&quot;, frustration was expressed amongst people outside of Sheffield that they were paying for something they do not use.

However, by 2014 plans to extend Supertram were in various stages of action, and patronage had gone up, from 7.8 million passenger journeys in 1996/97, to 15.0 million during 2011/12. The increase in usage was credited to various factors. Industry publication &quot;Rail&quot; pointed towards changes to route patterns, the introduction of onboard conductors, ticket simplification and refurbishment of the trams themselves as having generated greater appeal amongst the public.

Between 2012 and 2017, the number of passengers and operating revenue declined; during 2016/17, the network carried 12.6 million passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;16/17DfTstats&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons presented for the reduction included the disruptive rail replacement effort across the network, which involved partial closures and the use of buses as temporary replacements, as well as the impact of cheaper petrol.

===Tram-train services===

The tram-train extension to Rotherham opened on 25 October 2018, using seven new Vossloh-built Class 399 &quot;Citylink&quot; articulated electric multiple units. Trams operate on Network Rail&#x27;s line from Tinsley to Rotherham station and beyond to the Parkgate shopping centre, where services terminate on a short spur at the side of the railway, after travelling on the Supertram line from Cathedral to Meadowhall South/Tinsley. The station at Rotherham Central is a combined tram stop and railway station, with platforms 1 and 2 at Rotherham Central extended, with the new extensions numbered platforms 3 and 4 respectively. The stop at Parkgate is a single platform terminus. The first test run of the tram-train service (as far as Magna) was performed in the early hours of 10 May 2018, and the first gauging run all the way to Parkgate occurred in the early hours of 5 June 2018.
The existing Siemens-Duewag Supertram fleet were not upgraded for tram-train operation, so were not registered under TOPS and cannot be used on the line as they lack the relevant Network Rail safety systems and crashworthiness. The tram-train scheme was first planned to be in service by 2015 but was delayed.

The Class 399 units were built in 2015/16 with the first delivered in December 2015. Until the completion of the tram-train line, some were used to provide increased capacity on the existing Supertram network. They first entered service on 14 September 2017.

On the opening day of tram-train passenger operations the service was suspended following a road traffic collision on the tram network involving one of the tram-train vehicles. The incident was caused by lorry operated by Ability Handling passing a red traffic light and caused the tram to be derailed. The service has also been suspended twice after faults were found on the Citylink units. The first suspension was on 9 April 2019, when the fleet was withdrawn to undergo safety checks, although service resumed the next day. The service was later suspended again on 14 December 2019, resuming three days later on 17 December. Services have also operated on a reduced frequency several times whilst work has been undertaken on the Citylink fleet.

===Return to public operation===

On 18 October 2022 the South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard announced that the service would return to public operation once Stagecoach&#x27;s contract expired in March 2024, alongside a £100 million grant by the central government to modernise parts of the system. The date of the transfer was 22 March 2024, with a new operating company known as the South Yorkshire Future Tram Limited (SYFTL) taking over all Supertram operations.

Coppard&#x27;s authority manages the publicly-owned arm&#x27;s length organisation to manage the tram service.

==Current network==
===Routes===
The South Yorkshire Supertram network is organised around Park Square and consists of four lines – Yellow, Blue, Purple and Tram-Train (black on maps)

The lines, with termini at Meadowhall Interchange, Parkgate, Halfway and Hillsborough, all serve Sheffield city centre and meet at Park Square where a triangular junction was constructed to provide interchange between lines and operational flexibility. A pair of small branches serving Malin Bridge, from Hillsborough Interchange, and Herdings Park branch out from two of the main lines.

The Supertram runs from Sheffield City Centre north-west to Middlewood and Malin Bridge via the University of Sheffield and Hillsborough; north-east to Meadowhall Interchange and Rotherham Parkgate via Attercliffe; and south-east to Halfway and Herdings Park via Norfolk Park, Manor, and Gleadless.

The three main City Centre stops are located on one side of a former dual carriageway, now a single lane and reserved for buses and taxis only. These three stops are served by all routes.
===Stops===
The tram stops on each of the four routes are as follows:
=== Service frequency ===

==== Blue Route ====
Weekday and Saturday services run to a peak frequency of every 12 minutes at peak operational times between Malin Bridge and Halfway, and less at other times. Sunday services operate to a peak frequency of every 20 minutes, and less at other times.

==== Yellow Route ====
Weekday and Saturday services run to a peak frequency of every 12 minutes at peak operational times between Middlewood and Meadowhall Interchange, and less at other times. Sunday services operate to a peak frequency of every 20 minutes, and less at other times.

==== Purple Route ====
Weekday and Saturday services run hourly between Cathedral and Herdings Park during all operational times. Sunday services run to a peak frequency of every 30 minutes, and runs hourly at other times.

==== Tram-Train (Black) Route ====
Services run between Cathedral and Rotherham Parkgate every 30 minutes during operational times. 

==== COVID-19 services ====
A reduced level of service was introduced across the Supertram network on 23 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. A modified Sunday timetable was in operation, until services were further reduced to hourly on 1 April.

===Onward transport links===
The Stagecoach Yorkshire bus company formerly operated the SL1 and SL1a &quot;SupertramLink&quot; routes between the Middlewood terminus of the Yellow route and Stocksbridge, via Oughtibridge. The bus ran at the same frequency as the tram and was timetabled to connect with the tram at Middlewood. Through single, return, day and week tickets were available to allow travel on both Supertram and SupertramLink bus services. On 1 June 2020, Stagecoach withdrew the dedicated SupertramLink bus from Middlewood to Stocksbridge, providing an enhanced service on local bus service 57 from Hillsborough to Stocksbridge in its place.

==Rolling stock==
===Current fleet===
The following fleet is operated across the Supertram network:

====Siemens-Duewag Supertram====

The network operates 25 three car trams built by Siemens-Duewag of Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1992. The trams are 40% low floor design, the vehicles have been specially designed for gradients as steep as 10%. In the 1980s a design choice was taken to create the longest possible vehicle to avoid multiple working which resulted in a design, the third-longest tram design in operation in Europe at the time and the longest in service in the UK until the long Edinburgh Trams were introduced.

Launched in an initial light grey livery, following the awarding of the operating franchise to Stagecoach the trams were reliveried in Stagecoach&#x27;s corporate livery from 1997. From 2006 the trams were refurbished, and a new dedicated Supertram blue–based livery was launched, with the entire fleet completed in early 2009.

====Stadler Citylink (Class 399)====

Stadler supplied seven tram-train vehicles, delivered between November 2015 and November 2016.

==Infrastructure==

===Track===

The network is long, with of track. It features two types of track; tramway track where either pedestrians or road traffic share the right of way and ballasted railway track when there are no such requirements.

Tramway track consists of a grooved tramway rail set into a concrete base with troughs into which the rails are laid. Most of the track is on-street using 35G-section grooved tram rail, with BS11-80A flat-bottom rail elsewhere. The railway track was supplied by British Steel Corporation Track Products of Workington and laid on sleepers consisting of concrete blocks with steel ties which gives a spring feeling when travelling on these sections. The track is laid on a bed of ballast which in turn rests on a prepared formation. Street crossings are usually laid with grooved tramway rails.

There are some major structures. Two viaducts carry Supertram onto Park Square (a major road junction in the centre of the city), one of them being a six-span viaduct, the other the bowstring steel arch Park Square Bridge. An underpass takes the tram underneath the busy A57 roundabout outside the University of Sheffield.

===Tram stop design===

The Supertram has 50 tram stops, which are generally long and deep and are of a network-wide standard making them easy to understand and use. The design incorporates recommendations made by the Cranfield Institute of Technology who studied ergonomics for both able-bodied and disabled users.

The platforms are high, with a 1:20 slope. The platform edge comprises a wide light-coloured textured paving with strips of wide edge warning tactile strip. Directional guidance tactile paving crosses the width of the platform to coincide with the tram door locations.

===Power supply===
Supertram is powered through 12 electric substations and fed through cross-section overhead line equipment (OHLE) wire. The substations convert the 11 kV AC supply into supply into the overhead.

===Depot===

There is a single depot, located at Nunnery Square, which occupies former carriage sidings alongside the Sheffield to Lincoln railway line. It was designed and constructed by Balfour Beatty on of land and consists of a three-line workshop building, six stabling sidings, a turning loop, engineers sidings and sundry equipment.

Before the arrival of Supertram, the site was already dedicated to the railway industry. Nunnery engine shed filled most of the site whilst lines of the Midland Railway, Great Central Railway and London &amp; North Eastern Railway irrigated the area and served collieries.

==Fares and ticketing==
Prior to the Stagecoach takeover, ticketing was done via ticket machines, provided by Abberfield Technology of Australia. These blue ticket machines dispensed adult single ride tickets, senior citizen concessionary tickets and child concessionary tickets. As well as singles, the machines sold multi-packs at a discount. Fare tables were shown on the machines with the validity of the different prices. To travel, each ticket had to be validated in a yellow machine on the platform. The ticket defined the type of passenger and trip. On validation, an overprint was added, giving the tramstop code, time and date of validation and the point of validation.

As the machines did not dispense change, nearby shop-owners were often asked for change to purchase tickets from the machines. There were also problems with machine reliability. Just prior to Stagecoach taking over Supertram a move was made to remove the ticket machines and begin selling tickets on board using conductors. This change brought two key positives: an improved staff presence on board each tram, and meant that passenger&#x27;s tickets could be systematically checked.

Travel South Yorkshire tickets covering Sheffield or the whole of South Yorkshire are valid on Supertram services as well as local buses and trains. Unlike some other tramway and light rail operators in England, Supertram accepts concessionary travel passes issued by any English local authority. PlusBus tickets are accepted as well. During the period in which Stagecoach held the Supertram franchise, tickets were sold with combined validity on Supertram and Stagecoach Yorkshire bus services; these were discontinued when the tram network returned to public ownership in 2024.

In January 2020 the option to pay for a ticket via credit/debit card, along with other contactless methods of payment (such as Google Pay and Apple Pay), was introduced to all trams. Up until this point the only payment method onboard was cash.

In October 2020, £2.6million was allocated to Supertram to make up for lost revenue caused by the Coronavirus outbreak.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership and structure===
The system is owned by the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority, which consists of representatives from the metropolitan boroughs of Sheffield, Rotherham, Doncaster, and Barnsley.

Supertram is owned by SYMCA and operated by South Yorkshire Future Trams Ltd (SYFTL), SYFTL is an arms length body that operates and maintains the network under public ownership after being municipalised on 22 March 2024.

===Business trends===
Full financial figures do not appear to be published for the South Yorkshire Supertram; SYPTE produces its own annual accounts, but profit and loss figures for the tram operations are not shown separately.
The key available trends in recent years for South Yorkshire Supertram are (years ending 31 March):

Activities in the financial year 2020/21 were severely reduced by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

===Passenger numbers===
Detailed passenger journeys since Supertram commenced operations in May 1994 were:
==Proposed developments==
A number of extensions to the Supertram network have been proposed.

In May 2003, the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority announced plans to extend the Supertram network to Hellaby, a suburb of Rotherham; Dore, a suburb of Sheffield; and Ranmoor, Sheffield. None of these extensions have been built.

In August 2008, plans were announced for the trial of diesel-electro hybrid tram trains on a route via Network Rail tracks to Huddersfield via Meadowhall, Barnsley and Penistone. The fleet of five tram trains, costing £9 million was expected to be in operation by the end of 2010 with the whole project costing £24 million for the 37-mile route. It was planned that the hourly Northern Rail service from Sheffield to Huddersfield via the Penistone line would be scrapped, being replaced by a more frequent tram service with more stops and a faster service due to the trams&#x27; more rapid acceleration. Plans were also announced for a second trial between Rotherham Central and Sheffield at the same time.
The Sheffield to Huddersfield plans were later abandoned in September 2009, although the Sheffield to Rotherham route was to go ahead. The initial plan was to use electric vehicles capable of operating on either 750 V DC or , via Rotherham Central to a new station at Parkgate. The scheme was estimated to require £15 million, later revised upwards to £18.7 million to build when first proposed, but was eventually expected to cost £75.1 million. The Rotherham route was originally intended to begin operation in 2015, however this date was put back several times until the October 2018 opening date after a series of delays. Part of the delay was due to the transport secretary failing to approve the building of a 150m (164yd) section of track at Tinsley in a timely manner. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was critical of Network Rail&#x27;s initial estimates for the cost of modifications to the route calling them, &quot;wholly unrealistic&quot;. The PAC also noted that Network Rail and the Department for Transport could not provide figures on how much money had been spent on a now cancelled line electrification project. Part of the unexpected rise in the cost of creating the route and the delay was due to the need to demolish and rebuild the College Road road over-bridge next to Rotherham Central station. It was thought that the ballast beneath the railway line could have been excavated to provide headroom for the catenary but this proved not to be feasible.

In 2017, the Sheffield City Region invited public consultation on &quot;The Sheffield City Region Transport Strategy 2018–2040&quot; policy document (draft for consultation November 2017) in which it was revealed that only 1% of the population used the Supertram network on journeys to work in 2011.
The number of passengers on the Supertram network increased from 2 million in the 1994/1995 financial years to over 12 million in the 2016/2017 financial years.

In March 2020 there were plans to re-route the tram line from behind Sheffield station to Sheaf Street as part of a £1.5 billion plan to redevelop the station and surrounding area. It was anticipated that the scheme would be part-funded by the High Speed 2 (Phase 2b east) Sheffield link, cancelled in 2021.

In July 2021 a public consultation was opened about plans to build a new stop on the Tram Train route outside Magna Science Adventure Centre. In March 2024 Network Rail and South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (SYMCA) approved the new station at Magna, Templeborough. The station will be between the Meadowhall South/Tinsley stop and the Rotherham Central stop. Two staggered low-level tram-train platforms are to be installed, one for each line, with a connecting footbridge and an additional 29 parking spaces are to be created at the Magna site. The scheme is estimated to cost £6.6 million and will be funded from the Sheffield City Region&#x27;s £166 million Transforming Cities Fund.

In April 2022, the Sheffield Green Party unveiled their plans for the system, with extensions planned across South Yorkshire.

In September 2023, Rotherham Council proposed a new train station and tram stop in the Parkgate area.

In March 2024, when the tram was taken back into public ownership, it was revealed that talks were in progress about extending the network to Stocksbridge, Barrow Hill and Chesterfield with an emphasis on the routes serving hospitals. At the same time it was announced that the trams and stations would be deep cleaned within 100 days of commencement of public ownership. It was also revealed that the tram fleet would undergo refurbishment by 2027 and, subject to government funding, a new fleet of trams would be introduced by 2032.

==Accidents and incidents==
* In 1995, engineer William Roe suffered severe brain damage after his car skidded on wet tram tracks and crashed into a metal pole. Supertram were made to award Roe compensation for failing to ensure that the rails were level with the adjacent road surface, and for the lack of warning signs indicating that the tracks are hazardous when wet. It was reported there were 53 accidents involving Supertram in Sheffield between 1994 and 1997, including two fatalities and 12 serious injuries.
* On 7 March 2003, a man died from serious head injuries after he was hit by a tram whilst lying on the tracks.
* On 27 October 2005, a pedestrian was killed after stepping in front of an approaching tram.
* On 20 September 2008, a 75-year-old woman was seriously injured when she fell and was subsequently struck by a tram while it was arriving at the local tram stop. The woman was removed and transferred to the Northern General Hospital, suffering from head injuries, a fractured pelvis, and a broken leg.
* On 22 October 2015, trams 120 and 118 collided at Shalesmoor. This resulted in the two damaged sections of both trams requiring major repairs, whilst the undamaged parts of trams 120 and 118 were put together and painted in a version of the original Sheffield Tramways cream and blue livery to re-create the original 120. Tram 118 returned to service a year later in October 2016.
* In November 2016, teacher Terry Orwin sustained serious head injuries from crashing while riding a bicycle on Langsett Road and being caught by the tram tracks.
* On 22 December 2016, Saleh Qassim Saleh, 81, was killed in a collision with a tram. The driver was charged with causing death by careless driving.
* On 8 June 2017, trams 107 and 123 were involved in a low-speed collision at Halfway.
* On 19 July 2018, a passenger was injured when they were thrown across the tram as a result tram overspeeding at Middlewood Road and then braking suddenly. The impact of the passenger with a door caused the door to open.
* On 25 October 2018, the day the Tram-train service launched, a lorry collided with one such tram at approximately 3.30pm on Staniforth Road, near the Woodbourn Road station, derailing the tram-train. Three people were injured with two being treated on site and one taken to hospital. Initial reports indicate that the lorry pulled across the path of the Tram-train. On 12 August 2019, lorry driver Kevin Hague, 61, of Rotherham admitted driving through a red light at Sheffield Magistrates&#x27; Court. The BBC reported, &#x27;In a personal impact statement read to the court the driver of the tram-train said he was thankful he was in one of the new £4 million vehicles. They are built to higher crash-worthiness standards as they also run on Network Rail tracks.&#x27;
* On 30 November 2018, a car collided with a tram-train at approximately 4.30pm on Staniforth Road.
* On 22 May 2019, a man was hit by a tram shortly after having an argument with two men. He later died on 26 May 2019 and was named as Martin Rigg. A man was arrested on suspicion of murder on 1 June 2019.
* On 23 July 2021, tram 105 was derailed in a collision with a lorry on Cricket Inn Road. One person was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
* On 11 April 2022, tram 121 crashed into a police van near Leppings Lane. The van driver was taken to hospital with a broken leg.

==In popular culture==
* The tram features in the British children&#x27;s television series, Teletubbies, episode number 148 in season two, aired April 1998, titled &quot;My Dad&#x27;s a Tram Driver&quot;. Becky sits up front with her dad, looks at the tram&#x27;s buttons, and calls out Donetsk Way as the next stop, which features at the end of the segment.

<doc id="314978" wikidata="Q2494783" url="?curid=314978" title="Expander cycle">
<text>The expander cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine. In this cycle, the fuel is used to cool the engine&#x27;s combustion chamber, picking up heat and changing phase. The now heated and gaseous fuel then powers the turbine that drives the engine&#x27;s fuel and oxidizer pumps before being injected into the combustion chamber and burned.

Because of the necessary phase change, the expander cycle is thrust limited by the square–cube law. When a bell-shaped nozzle is scaled, the nozzle surface area with which to heat the fuel increases as the square of the radius, but the volume of fuel to be heated increases as the cube of the radius. Thus beyond approximately 3000 kN (700,000 lbf) of thrust, there is no longer enough nozzle area to heat enough fuel to drive the turbines and hence the fuel pumps. Higher thrust levels can be achieved using a bypass expander cycle where a portion of the fuel bypasses the turbine and or thrust chamber cooling passages and goes directly to the main chamber injector. Non-toroidal aerospike engines are not subject to the limitations from the square-cube law because the engine&#x27;s linear shape does not scale isometrically: the fuel flow and nozzle area scale linearly with the engine&#x27;s width. All expander cycle engines need to use a cryogenic fuel such as liquid hydrogen, liquid methane, or liquid propane that easily reaches its boiling point.

Some expander cycle engines may use a gas generator of some kind to start the turbine and run the engine until the heat input from the thrust chamber and nozzle skirt increases as the chamber pressure builds up.

Some examples of an expander cycle engine are the Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10 and the Vinci engine for Ariane 6.

== Expander bleed cycle ==

This operational cycle is a modification of the traditional expander cycle. In the bleed (or open) cycle, instead of routing all of the heated propellant through the turbine and sending it back to be combusted, only a small portion of the heated propellant is used to drive the turbine and is then bled off, being vented overboard without going through the combustion chamber. The other portion is injected into the combustion chamber. Bleeding off the turbine exhaust allows for a higher turbopump efficiency by decreasing backpressure and maximizing the pressure drop through the turbine. Compared with a standard expander cycle, this allows higher engine thrust at the cost of efficiency by dumping the turbine exhaust.

The Mitsubishi LE-5A was the world&#x27;s first expander bleed cycle engine to be put into operational service. The Mitsubishi LE-9 is the world&#x27;s first first stage expander bleed cycle engine.

Blue Origin chose the expander bleed cycle for the BE-3U engine used on the upper stage of its New Glenn launch vehicle.

== Dual expander ==
In a similar way that the staged combustion can be implemented separately on the oxidizer and fuel on the full flow cycle, the expander cycle can be implemented on two separate paths as the dual expander cycle. The use of hot gases of the same chemistry as the liquid for the turbine and pump side of the turbopumps eliminates the need for purges and some failure modes. Additionally, when the density of the fuel and oxidizer is significantly different, as it is in the H2/LOX case, the optimal turbopump speeds differ so much that they need a gearbox between the fuel and oxidizer pumps. The use of dual expander cycle, with separate turbines, eliminates this failure-prone piece of equipment.

Dual expander cycle can be implemented by either using separated sections on the regenerative cooling system for the fuel and the oxidizer, or by using a single fluid for cooling and a heat exchanger to boil the second fluid. In the first case, for example, you could use the fuel to cool the combustion chamber, and the oxidizer to cool the nozzle. In the second case, you could use the fuel to cool the whole engine and a heat exchanger to boil the oxidizer.

== Advantages ==
The expander cycle has a number of advantages over other designs:
;Low temperature:After they have turned gaseous, the propellants are usually near room temperature, and do very little or no damage to the turbine, allowing the engine to be reusable. In contrast gas-generator or staged combustion engines operate their turbines at high temperature.
;Tolerance: During the development of the RL10 engineers were worried that insulation foam mounted on the inside of the tank might break off and damage the engine. They tested this by putting loose foam in a fuel tank and running it through the engine. The RL10 chewed it up without problems or noticeable degradation in performance. Conventional gas-generators are in practice miniature rocket engines, with all the complexity that implies. Blocking even a small part of a gas generator can lead to a hot spot, which can cause violent loss of the engine. Using the engine bell as a &#x27;gas generator&#x27; also makes it very tolerant of fuel contamination because of the wider fuel flow channels used.
;Inherent safety: Because a bell-type expander-cycle engine is thrust limited, it can easily be designed to withstand its maximum thrust conditions. In other engine types, a stuck fuel valve or similar problem can lead to engine thrust spiraling out of control due to unintended feedback systems. Other engine types require complex mechanical or electronic controllers to ensure this does not happen. Expander cycles are by design incapable of malfunctioning that way.
;Higher vacuum performance: Compared to a pressure-fed engine, pump-fed engines and hence, expander cycle engines have higher combustion chamber pressures. Increased combustion chamber pressures allow for a reduced throat area Ath, and therefore, leads to a larger expansion ratio, e = Ae/Ath for an identical nozzle exit area Ae, which ultimately leads to higher vacuum performance.

<doc id="314979" wikidata="Q5456189" url="?curid=314979" title="Five Weirs Walk">
<text>The Five Weirs Walk runs alongside the River Don in Sheffield, England. From Lady&#x27;s Bridge in Sheffield City Centre (), it heads downstream, northeast, over the Cobweb Bridge, through Attercliffe to Meadowhall ().

As the name of the walk suggests, it passes five weirs. It is now possible to continue the walk along the Don, under the Tinsley Viaduct, to Rotherham. As of 2010, the section of the walk between Sheffield and Meadowhall has been linked with the parallel Sheffield and Tinsley Canal towpath as a circular walk known as the Blue Loop. The walk links with the Upper Don Walk at Lady&#x27;s Bridge.

== History ==
The Walk was conceived, developed and steered to completion by the Five Weirs Walk Trust, a handful of enthusiasts bolstered by support from statutory authorities, private companies, local charities, national funding bodies and countless members of the public. Over a period of 20 years and more, the Walk developed from a bright idea to a keystone in the regeneration of the urban river corridor.

A detail history can be found in the following document by the University of Sheffield:

Five Weirs Walk History

== Weirs ==
1. Walk Mill Weir 

Walk Mill includes bypass steps for kayakers &amp; canoeists to avoid the weir.

2. Burton Weir

3. Sanderson&#x27;s Weir – This weir includes a fishpass which was also designed to accommodate safe passage for canoes &amp; kayaks.

== Salmon Pastures nature reserve ==
Salmon Pastures is a small (0.19 ha (0.47 acres)) nature reserve, managed by the Wildlife Trust for Sheffield and Rotherham, adjacent to the walk. The site is visited by mistle thrush, bullfinch, goldfinch and long tailed tit. Kingfishers, little grebe, moorhens and mallards can be seen on the adjacent banks of the River Don. Invertebrates such as dragonflies, moths, butterflies and hoverfly can be seen at the reserve.

<doc id="314980" wikidata="Q467470" url="?curid=314980" title="Jacques Rancière">
<text>Jacques Rancière (; ; born 10 June 1940) is a French philosopher, Professor of Philosophy at European Graduate School in Saas-Fee and Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis. After co-authoring &quot;Reading Capital&quot; (1965) with the structuralist Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser and others, and after witnessing the 1968 political uprisings his work turned against Althusserian Marxism, he later came to develop an original body of work focused on aesthetics.

==Life and work==
Rancière contributed to the influential volume &quot;Reading Capital&quot; before publicly breaking with Althusser over his attitude toward the May 1968 student uprising in Paris; Rancière felt Althusser&#x27;s theoretical stance did not leave enough room for spontaneous popular uprising.

Since then, Rancière has departed from the path set by his teacher and published a series of works probing the concepts that make up the understanding of political discourse, such as ideology and proletariat. He sought to address whether the working class in fact exists, and how the masses of workers that thinkers like Althusser referred to continuously enter into a relationship with knowledge, particularly the limits of philosophers&#x27; knowledge with respect to the proletariat. An example of this line of thinking is Rancière&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Le philosophe et ses pauvres&quot; (&quot;The Philosopher and His Poor&quot;, 1983), a book about the role of the poor in the intellectual lives of philosophers.

From 1975 to 1981, Rancière was a figurehead for the Journal &quot;Les Révoltes Logiques&quot;. Forming partly out of a philosophy seminar on Workers’ history that Rancière gave at Vincennes, it drew together philosophers and historians for a radical political intervention into French thought after the May 1968 uprisings. Its title acting as both a reference to Arthur Rimbaud’s poem, &quot;Democratie (&quot;‘Nous Massacrerons les revoltes logiques’ – ‘We&#x27;ll smash all logic revolts.’) and the Maoist Cultural Revolutionary slogan adopted by the &quot;Gauche Prolétarienne&quot; group, of which some of &quot;Les Rèvoltes Logiques&quot;&#x27; members were active within, ‘On a raison de se revolter’ – ‘It is right to revolt.’, the Journal attempted to interrogate and contest the historiographic and political norms around the representation of workers’ and social history. Writing, along with figures like feminist historian Genevieve Fraisse, Rancière and others attempted to reveal the complexity, contradictions and diversity of ‘thought and history from below’. In its fifteen ordinary issues, the collective wished to overcome the historiographic norms in which the working class were given historical treatment but rendered voiceless, homogeneous and pre-theoretical; instead, they allowed workers to speak for themselves, and interrogated their words seriously.

More recently Rancière has written on the topic of human rights and specifically the role of international human rights organizations in asserting the authority to determine which groups of people, again the problem of masses, justify human rights interventions and even war.

Rancière&#x27;s book, &quot;The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation&quot; (original title &quot;Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l&#x27;émancipation intellectuelle&quot;, published in 1987) was written for educators and educators-to-be. Through the story of Joseph Jacotot, Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality as a starting point rather than a destination. In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach &quot;themselves&quot; whatever it is they want to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.

Jacotot advocated the &#x27;equality of intelligence&#x27; and claimed that an ignorant person could teach another ignorant person. Rancière developed this idea in &quot;The Ignorant Schoolmaster&quot;, saying that “there is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another ... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies”.

== Political philosophy ==

=== Basic concepts ===
Rancière&#x27;s philosophy began as markedly radical, anti-elitist, and aggressively anti-authoritarian, with a focus on comparing and contrasting aesthetics and politics that developed later in his career. Gabriel Rockhill published an English glossary of Rancière&#x27;s technical terms in 2004 as &quot;Appendix I&quot; to the English translation of Rancière&#x27;s &quot;The Politics of Aesthetics&quot; with cross references to their explication in Rancière&#x27;s major works. This glossary includes key terms in Rancière&#x27;s philosophy that either he invented or uses in a radically different manner than their common usages elsewhere such as aesthetic regime, aesthetic unconscious, archi-politics, Community of Equals, &quot;demos&quot;, &quot;dissensus&quot;, distribution of the sensible, emancipation, the ethical regime of images, literarity, meta-politics, &quot;ochlos&quot;, para-politics, partition of the sensible, police order, the poetics of knowledge, post-democracy, regimes of art, silent speech, and &quot;le tort.&quot;

Rancière&#x27;s political philosophy is characterized by a number of key concepts: politics, disagreement, police, equality, post-democracy:

* Politics — an activity the subject of which is equality.
* Disagreement — an insurmountable conflict between people, which is inherent in human nature and manifests itself in a speech situation when one of the interlocutors understands and does not understand the other at the same time.
* Police — a symbolic ordering of the social, aimed at determining the share of participation or lack of participation in each part. The concept goes back to the work of Michel Foucault in the 1970s.
* Equality — a set of practices aimed at certifying the equality of anyone with anyone.
* Post-democracy — consensus system of modernity based on the identity (full compliance) of society and the individual and the consideration of society as the sum of its parts.

== Influence ==
In 2006, it was reported that Rancière&#x27;s aesthetic theory had become a point of reference in the visual arts, and Rancière has lectured at such art world events as the Frieze Art Fair. Former French presidential candidate Ségolène Royal described Rancière as her favourite philosopher. 

Among those intellectuals influenced by his work, Gabriel Rockhill, the editor and translator into English of Rancière&#x27;s &quot;The Politics of Aesthetics&quot;, has developed a new paradigm for thinking about the historical relation between aesthetics and politics in close dialogue with Rancière&#x27;s writings. 

Rancière&#x27;s writings have also influenced developments in film theory, including historical and comparative approaches to representation, politics and spectatorship.

The literary critic Rita Felski has named Rancière as an important precursor to the project of postcritique within literary studies.

<doc id="314983" wikidata="Q259997" url="?curid=314983" title="Hydroxylamine">
<text>Hydroxylamine (also known as hydroxyammonia) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . The compound exists as hygroscopic colorless crystals. Hydroxylamine is almost always provided and used as an aqueous solution or more often as one of its salts such as hydroxylammonium sulfate, a water-soluble solid.

Hydroxylamine and its salts are consumed almost exclusively to produce Nylon-6. The oxidation of  to hydroxylamine is a step in biological nitrification.

==History==
Hydroxylamine was first prepared as hydroxylammonium chloride in 1865 by the German chemist Wilhelm Clemens Lossen (1838-1906); he reacted tin and hydrochloric acid in the presence of ethyl nitrate. It was first prepared in pure form in 1891 by the Dutch chemist Lobry de Bruyn and by the French chemist Léon Maurice Crismer (1858-1944). The coordination complex (zinc dichloride di(hydroxylamine)), known as Crismer&#x27;s salt, releases hydroxylamine upon heating.

==Structure==
Hydroxylamine and its &quot;N&quot;-substituted derivatives are pyramidal at nitrogen, with bond angles very similar to those of amines. The conformation of hydroxylamine places the NOH anti to the lone pair on nitrogen, seeming to minimize lone pair-lone pair interactions. 

==Production==
Hydroxylamine or its salts (salts containing hydroxylammonium cations ) can be produced via several routes but only two are commercially viable. It is also produced naturally as discussed in a section on biochemistry.

===From nitric oxide===
 is mainly produced as its sulfuric acid salt, hydroxylammonium sulfate (), by the hydrogenation of nitric oxide over platinum catalysts in the presence of sulfuric acid.

===Raschig process===
Another route to is the Raschig process: aqueous ammonium nitrite is reduced by  and  at 0 °C to yield a hydroxylamido-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-disulfonate anion:
This ammonium hydroxylamine disulfonate anion is then hydrolyzed to give hydroxylammonium sulfate:

===Other methods===
Julius Tafel discovered that hydroxylamine hydrochloride or sulfate salts can be produced by electrolytic reduction of nitric acid with HCl or  respectively:

Hydroxylamine can also be produced by the reduction of nitrous acid or potassium nitrite with bisulfite:
: (100 °C, 1 h)
Hydrochloric acid disproportionates nitromethane to hydroxylamine hydrochloride and carbon monoxide via the hydroxamic acid. 

A direct lab synthesis of hydroxylamine from molecular nitrogen in water plasma was demonstrated in 2024.

===Isolation of hydroxylamine===
Solid can be collected by treatment with liquid ammonia. Ammonium sulfate, , a side-product insoluble in liquid ammonia, is removed by filtration; the liquid ammonia is evaporated to give the desired product.
The net reaction is:

Base, such as sodium butoxide, can be used to free the hydroxylamine from hydroxylammonium chloride:

==Reactions==
Hydroxylamine is a base with a pKa of 6.03:

Hydroxylamine reacts with alkylating agents usually at the nitrogen atom:

The reaction of with an aldehyde or ketone produces an oxime.
This reaction can be useful in the purification of ketones and aldehydes: if hydroxylamine is added to an aldehyde or ketone in solution, an oxime forms, which generally precipitates from solution; heating the precipitate with aqueous acid then restores the original aldehyde or ketone.

 reacts with chlorosulfonic acid to give hydroxylamine-&quot;O&quot;-sulfonic acid:

It isomerizes to the amine oxide .

==Functional group==

Hydroxylamine derivatives substituted in place of the hydroxyl or amine hydrogen are (respectively) called &quot;O&quot;- or &quot;N&quot;hydroxyl­amines. In general &quot;N&quot;hydroxyl­amines are more common. Examples are &quot;N&quot;&quot;tert&quot;butyl­hydroxyl­amine or the glycosidic bond in calicheamicin. &quot;N&quot;,&quot;O&quot;Dimethyl­hydroxylamine is a precursor to Weinreb amides.

Similarly to amines, one can distinguish hydroxylamines by their degree of substitution: primary, secondary and tertiary. When stored exposed to air for weeks, secondary hydroxylamines degrade to nitrones.

&quot;N&quot;organyl­hydroxyl­amines, , where R is an organyl group, can be reduced to amines :
Oximes such as dimethylglyoxime are also employed as ligands.

===Synthesis===
The hydrolysis of N-substituted oximes, hydroxamic acids, and nitrones easily provides hydroxylamines. 

Alkylating of hydroxylamine or N-alkylhydroxylamines proceeds usually at nitrogen. One challenge is dialkylation when only monoalkylation is desired.
For O-alkylation of hydroxylamines, strong base such as sodium hydride is required to first deprotonate the OH group:
:

Amine oxidation with benzoyl peroxide is a common method to synthesize hydroxylamines. Care must be taken to prevent over-oxidation to a nitrone. Other methods include:
* Hydrogenation of an oxime
* Amine oxide pyrolysis (the Cope reaction)

==Uses==
Approximately 95% of hydroxylamine is used in the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime, a precursor to Nylon 6. The treatment of this oxime with acid induces the Beckmann rearrangement to give caprolactam. The latter can then undergo a ring-opening polymerization to yield Nylon 6.

==Laboratory uses==
Hydroxylamine and its salts are commonly used as reducing agents in myriad organic and inorganic reactions. They can also act as antioxidants for fatty acids.

High concentrations of hydroxylamine are used by biologists to introduce mutations by acting as a DNA nucleobase amine-hydroxylating agent. In is thought to mainly act via hydroxylation of cytidine to hydroxyaminocytidine, which is misread as thymidine, thereby inducing C:G to T:A transition mutations. But high concentrations or over-reaction of hydroxylamine &quot;in vitro&quot; are seemingly able to modify other regions of the DNA &amp; lead to other types of mutations. This may be due to the ability of hydroxylamine to undergo uncontrolled free radical chemistry in the presence of trace metals and oxygen, in fact in the absence of its free radical affects Ernst Freese noted hydroxylamine was unable to induce reversion mutations of its C:G to T:A transition effect and even considered hydroxylamine to be the most specific mutagen known. Practically, it has been largely surpassed by more potent mutagens such as EMS, ENU, or nitrosoguanidine, but being a very small mutagenic compound with high specificity, it found some specialized uses such as mutation of DNA packed within bacteriophage capsids, and mutation of purified DNA &quot;in vitro&quot;.
An alternative industrial synthesis of paracetamol developed by Hoechst–Celanese involves the conversion of ketone to a ketoxime with hydroxylamine.

Some non-chemical uses include removal of hair from animal hides and photographic developing solutions. In the semiconductor industry, hydroxylamine is often a component in the &quot;resist stripper&quot;, which removes photoresist after lithography.

Hydroxylamine can also be used to better characterize the nature of a post-translational modification onto proteins. For example, poly(ADP-Ribose) chains are sensitive to hydroxylamine when attached to glutamic or aspartic acids but not sensitive when attached to serines. Similarly, Ubiquitin molecules bound to serines or threonines residues are sensitive to hydroxylamine, but those bound to lysine (isopeptide bond) are resistant.

==Biochemistry==
In biological nitrification, the oxidation of to hydroxylamine is mediated by the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) further oxidizes hydroxylamine to nitrite.

Cytochrome P460, an enzyme found in the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria &quot;Nitrosomonas europea&quot;, can convert hydroxylamine to nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas.

Hydroxylamine can also be used to highly selectively cleave asparaginyl-glycine peptide bonds in peptides and proteins. It also bonds to and permanently disables (poisons) heme-containing enzymes. It is used as an irreversible inhibitor of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthesis on account of its similar structure to water.

==Safety and environmental concerns==
Hydroxylamine is a skin irritant but is of low toxicity.

A detonator can easily explode aqueous solutions concentrated above 80% by weight, and even 50% solution might prove detonable if tested in bulk. In air, the combustion is rapid and complete:
Absent air, pure hydroxylamine requires stronger heating and the detonation does not complete combustion:

At least two factories dealing in hydroxylamine have been destroyed since 1999 with loss of life. It is known, however, that ferrous and ferric iron salts accelerate the decomposition of 50% solutions. Hydroxylamine and its derivatives are more safely handled in the form of salts.

It is an irritant to the respiratory tract, skin, eyes, and other mucous membranes. It may be absorbed through the skin, is harmful if swallowed, and is a possible mutagen.

<text>United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court unanimously ordered President Richard Nixon to deliver tape recordings and other subpoenaed materials related to the Watergate scandal to a federal district court. Decided on July 24, 1974, the ruling was important to the late stages of the Watergate scandal, amidst an ongoing process to impeach Richard Nixon. &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot; is considered a crucial precedent limiting the power of any U.S. president to claim executive privilege.

Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote the opinion for a unanimous court, joined by Justices William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan, Potter Stewart, Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and Lewis F. Powell. Burger, Blackmun, and Powell were appointed to the Court by Nixon during his first term. Associate Justice William Rehnquist recused himself as he had previously served in the Nixon administration as an Assistant Attorney General.

== Summary ==
The case arose out of the Watergate scandal, which began during the 1972 presidential campaign between President Nixon and his Democratic challenger, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. On June 17, 1972, about five months before the election, five men broke into Democratic National Committee headquarters located in the Watergate Office Building in Washington, D.C.; these men were later found to have ties with the Nixon administration.

In May 1973, Attorney General Elliot Richardson appointed Archibald Cox to the position of special prosecutor, charged with investigating the break-in. Later that year, on October 20, Nixon ordered that Cox be fired, precipitating the immediate departures of both Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus in what became known as the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre&quot;. Cox&#x27;s firing kindled a firestorm of protest, forcing Nixon to appoint a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski.

In April 1974, Jaworski obtained a subpoena ordering Nixon to release certain tapes and papers related to specific meetings between the President and those indicted by the grand jury. Those tapes and the conversations they revealed were believed to contain damaging evidence involving the indicted men and perhaps the President himself.

Hoping that Jaworski and the public would be satisfied, Nixon turned over edited transcripts of 43 conversations, including portions of 20 conversations demanded by the subpoena. James D. St. Clair, Nixon&#x27;s attorney, then requested Judge John Sirica of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to quash the subpoena. While arguing before Sirica, St. Clair stated that:

The President wants me to argue that he is as powerful a monarch as Louis XIV, only four years at a time, and is not subject to the processes of any court in the land except the court of impeachment.

Sirica denied Nixon&#x27;s motion and ordered the President to turn the tapes over by May 31. Both Nixon and Jaworski appealed directly to the Supreme Court, which heard arguments on July 8. Nixon&#x27;s attorney argued the matter should not be subject to &quot;judicial resolution&quot; since the matter was a dispute within the executive branch and the branch should resolve the dispute itself. Also, he claimed Special Prosecutor Jaworski had not proven the requested materials were absolutely necessary for the trial of the seven men. Besides, he claimed Nixon had an absolute executive privilege to protect communications between &quot;high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in carrying out their duties.&quot;

== Opinion of the Court ==
Less than three weeks after oral arguments, the Court issued its decision.

On July 9, the day following oral arguments, all eight justices (Justice William H. Rehnquist recused himself due to his close association with several Watergate conspirators, including Attorneys General John Mitchell and Richard Kleindienst, prior to his appointment to the Court) indicated to each other that they would rule against the president. The justices struggled to settle on an opinion that all eight could agree to, however, with the major issue being how much of a constitutional standard could be established for what executive privilege meant.

Burger&#x27;s first draft was deemed problematic and insufficient by the rest of the Court, leading the other Justices to criticize and re-write major parts of the draft. The final draft would eventually heavily incorporate Justice Blackmun&#x27;s re-writing of Facts of the Case, Justice Douglas&#x27;s appealability section, Justice Brennan&#x27;s thoughts on standing, Justice White&#x27;s standards of admissibility and relevance, and Justices Powell and Stewart&#x27;s interpretation of executive privilege.

The stakes were so high, in that the tapes most likely contained evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the President and his men, that they wanted no dissent. Despite the Chief Justice&#x27;s hostility to allowing the other Justices to participate in the drafting of the opinion, the final version was agreed to on July 23, the day before the decision was announced, and would contain the work of all the Justices. The Court&#x27;s opinion found that the courts could indeed intervene on the matter and that Special Counsel Jaworski had proven a &quot;sufficient likelihood that each of the tapes contains conversations relevant to the offenses charged in the indictment&quot;. While the Court acknowledged that the principle of executive privilege did exist, the Court would also directly reject President Nixon&#x27;s claim to an &quot;absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.&quot;

The Court held that a claim of Presidential privilege as to materials subpoenaed for use in a criminal trial cannot override the needs of the judicial process if that claim is based, not on the ground that military or diplomatic secrets are implicated, but merely on the ground of a generalized interest in confidentiality.

“Neither the doctrine of separation of powers nor the generalized need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances,” Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote in the opinion.

It concluded that &quot;when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.&quot;

Nixon was then ordered to deliver the subpoenaed materials to the District Court.

Nixon resigned sixteen days later, on August 9, 1974.

<text>Wildeshausen (; Low Saxon: &quot;Wilshusen&quot;) is a town and the capital of the Oldenburg district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated by the river Hunte.

==History==
After the Thirty-years war which Sweden stood victorious they would gain large swats of modern day Germany. After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, they would gain Pommerania, Wismar, Bremen-Verden and Wildeshausen. While Bremen- Verden, Pommerania and Wismar were long lasting dominions of Sweden, Wildeshausen was just a township briefly under Sweden.

The Swedish crown granted the Wildeshausen to Count Gustav Gustavsson of Vasaborg, an illegitimate son of Gustavus II Adolphus and Margareta Slots, thus a half-brother of the then Swedish queen Kristina.

Gustav had served in the Swedish armed forces during the war and was ennobled to Vasaborg in 1637 (introduction at Riddarhuset in 1647); he also had several estates in Finland. After receiving Wildeshausen, he moved to Germany and died in his new city of residence on 25 October 1653.

The next lord of Wildeshausen was Gustav Gustavsson&#x27;s son and successor, Gustav Adolf of Vasaborg, who was only a few months old at the time of his father&#x27;s death. As an adult, he pursued a military career in Braunschweig-Lüneburg but lost Wildeshausen during the wars of the 1670s.

Already in 1679, after the Peace of Nijmegen the Swedish crown ceded Wildeshausen to the Prince-Bishop of Münster, formally against a loan of 100,000 Riksdaler. The area was further mortgaged to Hanover in 1700. However, Gustav Adolf still lived in the area and died in Wildeshausen in 1732.

==Attractions==
There are stone monuments and old burial places dating to the third millennium BC. One of these areas, Kleinenkneter Steine, was reconstructed in the 1930s. The local Tourist Center, located in the old Rathaus (Town hall) has maps for tours and walks.

===Kurpark===
The &quot;Kurpark&quot; has a fountain, concert-shell and a wading pool and is in the Luftkurort (fresh air park) Wildeshausen. 
During the summer month concerts take place every Sunday morning at 11 a.m. The tattoo (or tabs) occurs on Pfingst Sonntag, (Pentecost Sunday) at night, when the &quot;Schützengilde&quot; from 1403 presents a firework to open the traditional &quot;Gildefest&quot;.

===St.Peter Church===
An ecumenical ceremony on November 27, 1998 re-opened the St. Peter Church for divine services. From August 2, 1997 until then the Roman Catholic Church used the facilities of the Alexander Church by invitation.
The church had to be closed because of structural problems. 16 months were needed for re-construction.
From 1699 on the Alexander Church was used for evangelic Lutheran services. During this year Sweden became the ruling faction. The Catholics bought a house with several additional buildings and out of a barn &quot;a church like building&quot; was developed. During 1700 to 1803 Hannover ruled, Catholics were not allowed to build a new church. Only in 1810, when Oldenburg took over Wildeshausen the Catholics were allowed freedom to follow their religion. They built their church, which opened on November 24, 1811. The church had to be closed again due to structural mistakes, making it unsafe. In 1824 the current church was finally built, without a tower. The tower was erected in 1910. 
&quot;The times of division between the religious communities are, thank God, over now&quot; was stated by R. Gryczan/H.Holtmann.

===Marketplace===
In the middle of Wildeshausen is the marketplace. The pointed gables of the surrounding houses faced the street. On the remaining houses stone façades have replaced the former wooden gables. The &quot;Markt Brunnen&quot;(fountain) was built in 1747 by master Theophil from Bremen.This fountain was used for drinking by men and animals. Wildeshausen was located on an old trade route. In pagan times an &quot;Irmen Säule &quot; stood here. After the town was &quot;captured by Münster&quot; in 1529 the Mayor Jakob Lickenberg was executed here. A stone by the Market Brunnen in the Market Place is in memory of this. In 1990 Wildeshausen erected a new town hall with &quot;Glockenspiel&quot; and moving figures.

===Waltbert===
In the &quot;Westerstraße&quot; there is a sculpture, Waltbert. In 851, Waltbert, a grandson of Widukind, brought the relics of St. Alexander from Rome to Wildeshausen to further Christianity in the sparsely populated area. The sculpture shows Waltbert on his horse, in his hands the relic of St. Alexander. Then follows his name, the year 851 and the word &quot;translatio&quot;. The &quot;translatio Alexandri&quot; once was described by the monks of Fulda.

===Whitsun: &quot;Gildefest&quot;===
A week-long festival, the &quot;Gildfest&quot;, has occurred in Wildeshausen on Whitsun (German: &quot;Pfingsten&quot;) since 1403. The Mayor is the General of the Guild. The town director is the chief of protocol (Major). A related expression is: &quot;The town of Wildeshausen is the &quot;Schützengilde&quot; and the Schützengilde is the town of Wildeshausen&quot;. A granite sculpture, called &quot;cylinder&quot;, by A. Boldt represents the Schützengilde in the inner city.

===Alexander Church===

The founding of the Alexander Church goes back to 814. In 807 Waltbert, a grandson of Duke Wittekind, brought the relics of the sainted Alexander from Rome by way of the Alpine mountains to Wildeshausen. Alexander died, as well as his mother and 6 brothers, as executed martyrs during the persecution of Christians in the first century. Waltbert donated a &quot;Chorherren Stift&quot; (a type of monastery, where the cleric lived to the rules of the Benedictines) named &quot;Alexander Kapitel&quot;. It was to be used as a mission for the surrounding area (called Lerigau, or Largau). Wildeshausen became a place of pilgrimage, benefiting it economically. The Church and &quot;Stift&quot; owned treasures and were decorated with pictures. During renovation frescos were discovered.
The Alexander Church is the only basilica in the area of Oldenburg. The style documents the transition from the late Roman to the early gothic style of the 13th century.

===Pestruper Burial Ground===
In the Bronze Age, when bronze replaced the hard to produce stone tools, the inhabitants of this area remained here.
They began to en-tomb their dead now in burial grounds.

The Pestruper Burial Ground is the only preserved such structure in Europe. It is situated about 800 meters from the river Hunte.500 tombs, different in form and size, are evidence of the settlement that 600 years B.C. buried their urns with the ashes there. For each individual urn a hill would be erected, created with sods of grass. During the examination of the &quot;kings tombs (Königshügel) traces of the earlier stone age. Ritual plough traces from the Bronze Age were discovered. 1100-700 B.C.

The &#x27;kings tombs&#x27; (&quot;Königshügel&quot;) consist of burials from different ages (late Bronze Age to pre-Roman Iron Age). The farmers, breeders, hunters and fishermen were contemporaries of &quot;Ötzi&quot; from the ice age.

<doc id="314992" wikidata="Q352123" url="?curid=314992" title="Gary Johnson">
<text>Gary Earl Johnson (born January 1, 1953) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 29th governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003 as a member of the Republican Party. He has been a member of the Libertarian Party since 2011 and was the party&#x27;s nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 and 2016 elections. He was also the Libertarian nominee in the 2018 U.S. Senate election in New Mexico.

Johnson entered politics for the first time by running for governor of New Mexico in 1994 on a low-tax, anti-crime platform, promising a &quot;common-sense business approach&quot;. He defeated incumbent Democratic governor Bruce King, 50% to 40%. He cut the 10% annual growth in the budget, in part by using the gubernatorial veto 200 times during his first six months. He was unable to convince the state senate to pass any of his motions. Johnson sought reelection in 1998, winning by 55% to 45%. In his second term, he concentrated on the issue of school voucher reforms as well as campaigning for cannabis decriminalization. During his tenure as governor, Johnson adhered to an anti-tax policy, setting state and national records for the number of times he used his veto power: more than the other 49 contemporary governors put together. Term-limited, Johnson retired from front-line politics in 2003.

Johnson ran for president in 2012, initially as a Republican on a libertarian platform emphasizing the United States public debt and a balanced budget, protection of civil liberties, military non-interventionism, replacement of income tax with the FairTax, and opposition to the War on Drugs. In December 2011, he withdrew his candidacy for the Republican nomination and ran for the Libertarian nomination instead, winning the nomination in May 2012. Johnson received 1.3 million votes (1%), more than all other minor candidates combined.

Johnson ran again for President in 2016, once again winning the Libertarian nomination. He named former Republican governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld as his running mate. Johnson received nearly 4.5 million votes (3.3% of the total vote), which is the most for a third-party presidential candidate since 1996 and the highest national vote share for a Libertarian candidate in history. After the 2016 presidential election, Johnson said he would not run for president again. He ran for the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian in the 2018 New Mexico senate race against incumbent Democratic senator Martin Heinrich, coming in third with 15.4% of the statewide vote (107,201 votes). Johnson has since maintained a low profile and has had little involvement in politics.

==Early life and career==
Johnson was born on January 1, 1953, in Minot, North Dakota, the son of Lorraine B. (née Bostow), who worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Earl W. Johnson, a public school teacher and World War II Army veteran who participated in the Invasion of Normandy and fought at the Battle of Bastogne, earning three Purple Hearts during his service in the 101st Airborne Division. In 1971, Johnson graduated from Sandia High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he was on the school track team. He attended the University of New Mexico (UNM) from 1971 to 1975 and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science. While at UNM, he joined the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. It was there that he met his future wife, Denise &quot;Dee&quot; Simms.

While in college, Johnson earned money as a door-to-door handyman. His success in that industry encouraged him to start his own business, Big J Enterprises, in 1976. When he started the business, which focused on mechanical contracting, Johnson was its only employee. His firm&#x27;s major break came when he received a large contract from Intel&#x27;s expansion in Rio Rancho, which increased Big J&#x27;s revenue to $38 million.

To cope with the growth of the company, Johnson enrolled in a time management course at , which he credits with making him heavily goal driven. He eventually grew Big J into a multimillion-dollar corporation with over 1,000 employees. By the time he sold the company in 1999, it was one of New Mexico&#x27;s leading construction companies.

==Governor of New Mexico==
===First term===

Johnson entered politics in 1994 with the intention of running for governor and was advised by &quot;Republican Elders&quot; to run for the State Legislature instead. Despite their advice, Johnson spent $500,000 of his own money and entered the race with the intent of bringing a &quot;common sense business approach&quot; to the office. Johnson&#x27;s campaign slogan was &quot;People before Politics&quot;. His platform emphasized tax cuts, job creation, state government spending growth restraint, and law and order. He won the Republican nomination, defeating state legislator Richard P. Cheney by 34% to 33%, with John Dendahl and former governor David F. Cargo in third and fourth. Johnson subsequently won a plurality in the three-way general election, defeating the incumbent Governor Bruce King (a relatively conservative Democrat) and the former Lieutenant Governor Roberto Mondragón (who ran as a Green) with just under 50% of the vote. Johnson was elected in a nationally Republican year, although party registration in the state of New Mexico at the time was 2-to-1 Democratic.

As governor, Johnson followed a strict small-government approach. According to former New Mexico Republican National Committee member Mickey D. Barnett, &quot;Any time someone approached him about legislation for some purpose, his first response always was to ask if government should be involved in that to begin with.&quot; He vetoed 200 of 424 bills passed in his first six months in officea national record of 47% of all legislationand used the line-item veto on most remaining bills. In office, Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the 10% annual growth of the state budget. In his first budget, Johnson proposed a wide range of tax cuts, including a repeal of the prescription drug tax, a $47 million income tax cut, and a 6-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax cut. However, of these, only the gasoline tax cut was passed. During the November 1995 federal government shutdown, he joined 20 other Republican governors who called on the Republican leadership in Congress to stand firm against the Clinton administration in budget negotiations; in the article reporting on the letter and concomitant news conference he was quoted as calling for eliminating the budget deficit through proportional cuts across the budget. Although Johnson worked to reduce overall state spending, in his first term he raised education spending by nearly a third. When drop-out rates and test scores showed little improvement, Johnson changed his tactics and began advocating school vouchersa key issue in budget battles of his second term as governor.

===Second term===

In 1998, Johnson ran for reelection as governor against Democratic Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chávez. In his campaign, Johnson promised to continue the policies of his first term: improving schools; cutting state spending, taxes, and bureaucracy; and frequent use of his veto and line-item veto power. Fielding a strong Hispanic candidate in a 40% Hispanic state, the Democrats were expected to oust Johnson, but Johnson won by a margin of 55% to 45%. This made him the first governor of New Mexico to serve two successive four-year terms after term limits were expanded to two terms in 1991. Johnson made the promotion of a school voucher system a &quot;hallmark issue&quot; of his second term. In 1999, he proposed the first statewide voucher system in America, which would have enrolled 100,000 students in its first year.

That year, he vetoed two budgets that failed to include a voucher program and a government shutdown was threatened, but ultimately yielded to Democratic majorities in both houses of the New Mexico Legislature, who opposed the plan. Johnson signed the budget, but line-item vetoed a further $21 million, or 1%, from the legislative plan. In 1999, Johnson became one of the highest-ranking elected officials in the US to advocate the legalization of marijuana. Saying the War on Drugs was &quot;an expensive bust&quot;, he advocated the decriminalization of marijuana use and concentration on harm-reduction measures for all other illegal drugs. He compared attempts to enforce the nation&#x27;s drug laws with the failed attempt at alcohol prohibition. In remarks in 2011, he noted: &quot;Half of what government spends on police, courts and prisons is to deal with drug offenders.&quot; He suggested that drug abuse be treated as a health issue, not as a criminal issue. His approach to the issue garnered supportive notice from conservative icon William F. Buckley, as well as the Cato Institute and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In 2000, Johnson proposed a more ambitious voucher program than he had proposed the year before, under which each parent would receive $3,500 per child for education at any private or parochial school. The Democrats sought $90m extra school funding without school vouchers, and questioned Johnson&#x27;s request for more funding for state-run prisons, having opposed his opening of two private prisons. Negotiations between the governor and the legislature were contentious, again nearly leading to a government shutdown. In 2000, New Mexico was devastated by the Cerro Grande Fire. Johnson&#x27;s handling of the disaster earned him accolades from &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, which observed that:
 Johnson...was all over the Cerro Grande Fire last week. He helped reporters understand where the fire was headed when low-level Forest Service officials couldn&#x27;t, ran herd over the bureaucratic process of getting state and federal agencies and the National Guard involved, and even helped put out some of the fire with his feet. On a tour of Los Alamos last Wednesday, when he saw small flames spreading across a lawn, he had his driver stop his car. He jumped out and stomped on the flames, as did his wife and some of his staffers. Johnson&#x27;s leadership during the fire was praised by Democratic Congressman Tom Udall, who said: &quot;I think the real test of leadership is when you have circumstances like this. He&#x27;s called on his reserves of energy and has just been a really excellent leader under very difficult circumstances here.&quot; Johnson rebuffed efforts by the Libertarian Party to draft him in the 2000 presidential election, stating himself to be a Republican with no interest in running for president.

===Reception===
According to anonymous sources, Governor Johnson was known for a lack of interest in policy details and those who worked with Johnson at the time &quot;recall a chief executive who would speed through meetings and often preferred to discuss his fitness routine than focus on the minutiae of policymaking.&quot; In his first term, he frequently clashed with the legislature, but in the second term, he &quot;became more comfortable with the limits of his executive power&quot; and took a more conciliatory approach.
Commentator Andrew Sullivan quoted a claim that Johnson &quot;is highly regarded in the state for his outstanding leadership during two terms as governor. He slashed the size of state government during his term and left the state with a large budget surplus.&quot; In an interview in &quot;Reason&quot; in January 2001, Johnson&#x27;s accomplishments in office were described as follows: &quot;no tax increases in six years, a major road building program, shifting Medicaid to managed care, constructing two new private prisons, canning 1,200 state employees, and vetoing a record number of bills.&quot; According to one New Mexico paper, &quot;Johnson left the state fiscally solid&quot; and was &quot;arguably the most popular governor of the decade... leaving the state with a $1 billion budget surplus.&quot; &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reported that when Johnson left office, &quot;the size of state government had been substantially reduced and New Mexico was enjoying a large budget surplus.&quot; In a 2016 &quot;National Review&quot; article, Johnson was criticized for claiming to have balanced New Mexico&#x27;s budget every year. The Constitution of New Mexico requires that the state budget be balanced, with its debt in a separate &quot;capital outlay&quot; budget. The article stated that under Johnson New Mexico&#x27;s debt increased from $1.8 billion to $4.6 billion and its budget increased from $4.397 billion to $7.721 billion.

According to a 2011 profile of Johnson in the &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;During his tenure, he vetoed more bills than the other 49 governors combined750 in total, one third of which had been introduced by Republican legislators. Johnson also used his line-item-veto power thousands of times. He credits his heavy veto pen for eliminating New Mexico&#x27;s budget deficit and cutting the growth rate of New Mexico&#x27;s government in half.&quot; According to the &quot;Myrtle Beach Sun News&quot;, Johnson &quot;said his numerous vetoes, only two of which were overridden, stemmed from his philosophy of looking at all things for their cost–benefit ratio and his axe fell on Republicans as well as Democrats.&quot;

While in office, Johnson was criticized for opposing funding for an independent study of private prisons after a series of riots and killings at the facilities. Martin Chavez, his opponent in the 1998 New Mexico gubernatorial race, criticized Johnson for his frequent vetoing of programs, suggesting that it resulted in New Mexico&#x27;s low economic and social standing nationally. Journalist Mark Ames described Johnson as &quot;a hard-core conservative&quot; who &quot;ruled the state like a right-wing authoritarian&quot; and only embraced marijuana legalization in his second term for populist gain. This was mainly in reference to a commercial from Johnson&#x27;s reelection campaign featuring Johnson saying that a felon in New Mexico would serve &quot;every lousy second&quot; of their prison sentence. Johnson insisted, however, that the commercial was directed at &quot;the guy who&#x27;s got his gun out&quot; rather than nonviolent drug offenders.

===Post governorship===
Johnson was term limited and could not run for a third consecutive term as governor in 2002. In the 2008 presidential election campaign, Johnson endorsed Ron Paul for the Republican nomination, &quot;because of his commitment to less government, greater liberty, and lasting prosperity for America.&quot; Johnson spoke at Paul&#x27;s &quot;Rally for the Republic&quot; on September 2, 2008.

Johnson serves on the Advisory Council of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, a student nonprofit organization which advocates for drug policy reform.

, he serves on the board of directors of Students For Liberty, a nonprofit libertarian organization. His first book, &quot;Seven Principles of Good Government&quot;, was published on August 1, 2012.

==2012 presidential campaign==
===Early campaign===
In 2009, Johnson began indicating interest in running for president in the 2012 election. In the April 20, 2009, edition of &quot;The American Conservative&quot; magazine, Bill Kauffman told readers to &quot;keep an eye out&quot; for a Johnson presidential campaign in 2012, reporting that Johnson had told him that &quot;he was keeping his options open for 2012&quot; and that &quot;he may take a shot at the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 as an antiwar, anti-Fed, pro-personal liberties, slash-government-spending candidatein other words, a Ron Paul libertarian&quot;. During a June 24, 2009, appearance on Fox News&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Watch&quot;, host Judge Andrew Napolitano asked Johnson if he would run for president in 2012, to which Johnson responded that he thought it would be inappropriate to openly express his desires before President Obama is given the opportunity to prove himself, but he followed up that statement by saying &quot;it appears personal freedoms are being shoveled out the window more and more.&quot;

In an October 26, 2009, interview with the &quot;Santa Fe New Mexican&#x27;s&quot; Steve Terrell, Johnson announced his decision to form an advocacy committee called the Our America Initiative to help him raise funds and promote small government ideas. In December 2009, Johnson asked strategist Ron Nielson of NSON Opinion Strategy, who has worked with Johnson since 1993 when he ran his successful gubernatorial campaign, to organize the Our American Initiative as a 501(c)(4) committee. Nielson serves as a senior advisor to Our America Initiative. The stated focus of the organization is to &quot;speak out on issues regarding topics such as government efficiency, lowering taxes, ending the war on drugs, protecting civil liberties, revitalizing the economy and promoting entrepreneurship and privatization&quot;. The move prompted speculation among media pundits and Johnson&#x27;s supporters that he might be laying the groundwork for a 2012 presidential run. Throughout 2010, Johnson repeatedly deflected questions about a 2012 presidential bid by saying his 501(c)(4) status prevented him from expressing a desire to run for federal office on politics.

In February 2010, Johnson was a featured speaker at both the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and the Republican Liberty Caucus. At CPAC, &quot;the crowd liked himeven as he pushed some of his more controversial points.&quot; Johnson tied with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for third in the CPAC Straw Poll, trailing only Ron Paul and Mitt Romney (and ahead of such notables as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels and former Alaska Governor and 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin). David Weigel of &quot;Slate&quot; called Johnson the second-biggest winner of the conference, writing that his &quot;third-place showing in the straw poll gave Johnson his first real media hook ... He met tons of reporters, commanded a small scrum after the vote, and is a slightly lighter shade of dark horse now.&quot;

===Republican presidential candidacy===
On April 21, 2011, Johnson announced via Twitter, &quot;I am running for president.&quot; He followed this announcement with a speech at the New Hampshire State House in Concord, New Hampshire. He was the first of an eventually large field to announce his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. Johnson again chose Ron Nielson of NSON Opinion Strategy, a director for both of his New Mexico gubernatorial campaigns, as his presidential campaign manager and senior advisor. The campaign was headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, where Nielson&#x27;s offices are located. Johnson&#x27;s economics advisor was Harvard economics professor Jeffrey Miron. Initially, Johnson hoped Ron Paul would not run for president so that Johnson could galvanize Paul&#x27;s network of libertarian-minded voters, and he even traveled to Houston to tell Paul of his decision to run in person, but Paul announced his candidacy on May 13, 2011.

Johnson participated in the first of the Republican presidential debates, hosted by Fox News in South Carolina on May 5, 2011, appearing on stage with Herman Cain, Ron Paul, Tim Pawlenty, and Rick Santorum. Mitt Romney and Michele Bachmann both declined to debate. Johnson was excluded from the next three debates on June 13 (hosted by CNN in New Hampshire), August 11 (hosted by Fox News in Iowa), and September 7 (hosted by CNN in California). After the first exclusion, Johnson made a 43-minute video responding to each of the debate questions, which he posted on YouTube. The first exclusion, which was widely publicized, gave Johnson &quot;a little bump&quot; in name recognition and produced &quot;a small uptick&quot; in donations. But &quot;the long term consequences were dismal.&quot; For the financial quarter ending June 30, Johnson raised a mere $180,000. Fox News decided that because Johnson polled at least 2% in five recent polls, he could participate in a September 22 debate in Florida, which it co-hosted with the Florida Republican Party (the party objected to Johnson&#x27;s inclusion). Johnson participated, appearing on stage with Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum. During the debate, Johnson delivered what many media outlets, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;, called the best line of the night: &quot;My next-door neighbor&#x27;s two dogs have created more shovel ready jobs than this administration.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; opined that Johnson had won the debate.

===Libertarian presidential nomination and campaign===
Although Johnson had focused the majority of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011, that he would no longer campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he might run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference.
On December 28, 2011, Johnson formally withdrew his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, and declared his candidacy for the 2012 presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party in Santa Fe, New Mexico. On May 5, 2012, at the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Johnson received the Libertarian Party&#x27;s official nomination for president in the 2012 election, by a vote of 419 votes to 152 votes for second-place candidate R. Lee Wrights. In his acceptance speech, Johnson asked the convention&#x27;s delegates to nominate as his running mate Judge Jim Gray of California. Gray subsequently received the party&#x27;s vice-presidential nomination on the first ballot.

Johnson spent the early months of his campaign making media appearances on television programs such as &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; and &quot;Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld&quot;. Starting in September 2012, Johnson embarked on a three-week tour of college campuses throughout the US. On October 23, 2012, Gary Johnson participated in a third-party debate that was aired on C-SPAN, RT America, and Al Jazeera English. A post-debate online election allowed people to choose two candidates from the debate they thought had won to face each other head-to-head in a run-off debate. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein won the poll.

Johnson stated that his goal was to win at least 5 percent of the vote, as winning 5 percent would allow Libertarian Party candidates equal ballot access and federal funding during the next election cycle. In a national Gallup poll of likely registered voters conducted June 7 through June 10, 2012, Johnson took 3% of the vote, while a Gallup poll conducted September 6 through September 9, 2012, showed Johnson taking 1% of likely voters.

The final results showed Johnson received 1% of the popular vote, a total of 1,275,971 votes. This was the best result in the Libertarian Party&#x27;s history by raw vote number, though under the 1.1 percentage of the vote won by Ed Clark in 1980. Despite falling short of his stated goal of 5%, Johnson stated, &quot;Ours is a mission accomplished.&quot; In regards to a future presidential bid, he said &quot;it is too soon to be talking about 2016&quot;.

==Inter-presidential campaign activities==
After the 2012 elections, Johnson continued to criticize the Obama administration on various issues. In an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Johnson called on United States Attorney General Eric Holder to let individual states legalize marijuana. In a Google Hangout hosted by Johnson in June 2013, he criticized the US government&#x27;s lack of transparency and due process in regards to the NSA&#x27;s domestic surveillance programs. He also said that he would not rule out running as a Republican again in the future.

===Our America Initiative PAC===
In December 2013, Johnson announced the founding of his own Super PAC, Our America Initiative PAC. The Super PAC is intended to support libertarian-minded causes. &quot;From the realities of government-run healthcare setting in to the continuing disclosures of the breadth of NSA&#x27;s domestic spying, more Americans than ever are ready to take a serious look at candidates who offer real alternatives to business-as-usual,&quot; the release announcing the PAC said.

===CEO of Cannabis Sativa Inc.===
In July 2014, Johnson was named president and CEO of Cannabis Sativa Inc., a Nevada-based company that aims primarily to sell medical cannabis products in states where medicinal and/or recreational cannabis is legal.

===Libertarians for National Popular Vote===
In 2020, Johnson joined the Libertarians for National Popular Vote&#x27;s advisory board.

==2016 presidential campaign==

In an April 2014 &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; session on Reddit, Johnson stated that he hoped to run for president again in 2016. On whether he would run as a Libertarian or a Republican, he stated: &quot;I would love running as a Libertarian because I would have the least amount of explaining to do.&quot;
In November 2014, Johnson affirmed his intention to run for the 2016 Libertarian nomination. In July 2015, Johnson reiterated his intentions for a presidential campaign but stated he was not announcing anything imminently: &quot;I just think there are more downsides than upsides to announcing at this point, and, look, I don&#x27;t have any delusions about the process. In retrospect, 90 percent of the time I spent [trying to become president] ended up to be wasted time.&quot;

In January 2016, Johnson resigned from his post as CEO of Cannabis Sativa, Inc., to pursue political opportunities, hinting to a 2016 presidential run.

On January 6, 2016, Johnson declared that he would seek the Libertarian nomination for the presidency. On May 18, Johnson named former Massachusetts Governor William Weld as his running mate. The 2016 Libertarian National Convention was held in May later that year, with Johnson among the candidates seeking the nomination. The third day of the convention featured a debate among the candidates. When each of the candidates was asked if he would support mandating driver&#x27;s licenses, Johnson was the sole candidate to answer affirmitavely. When he began responding that he believed drivers should &quot;show some competency&quot;, he was promptly booed. Nonetheless, on May 29, 2016, Johnson received the Libertarian nomination on the second ballot. Johnson was on the ballot in all 50 states.

On September 8, Johnson appeared on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; and was asked by panelist Mike Barnicle, &quot;As president, what would you do about Aleppo?&quot; Johnson responded, &quot;And what is Aleppo?&quot; After a clarification from Barnicle, Johnson answered by saying that &quot;the only way that we deal with Syria is to join hands with Russia to diplomatically bring that at an end.&quot; Johnson criticized U.S. support for the Free Syrian Army and Kurdish forces and stated that the &quot;mess&quot; in Syria was &quot;the result of regime change that we end up supporting. And, inevitably, these regime changes have led to a less-safe world.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s &quot;what is Aleppo?&quot; question drew widespread attention, much of it negative. In response to charges that he was uninformed, Johnson said that he had &quot;blanked,&quot; that he did &quot;understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict,&quot; and that he had thought that Barnicle&#x27;s reference to &quot;Aleppo&quot; was in relation to &quot;an acronym, not the Syrian conflict.&quot;

On September 23, in an MSNBC interview with Kasie Hunt, Gary Johnson noted the benefits of being invited to the 2016 Presidential Debates. While discussing this topic, Johnson stuck out his tongue through his teeth at the reporter while explaining that he could win a three-way debate, and ultimately the Presidency, versus Clinton and Trump while speaking in that manner. Johnson&#x27;s spokesperson, John LaBeaume, later stated, &quot;He was just having fun&quot; and that it was &quot;lighthearted&quot;.

On September 28, in a MSNBC Town Hall, Johnson was asked by Chris Matthews to name a world leader he respected, he tried to name Vicente Fox, a former President of Mexico, but could not remember his name. The following day, he tweeted, &quot;It&#x27;s been almost 24 hours...and I still can&#x27;t come up with a foreign leader I look up to.&quot; Later in a CNN interview, he expanded upon his reluctance to endorse political leaders, &quot;I held a lot of people in this country on pedestals and then I get to meet them up front and personal and I find out that they&#x27;re all about getting reelected, that they&#x27;re not about issues, a lot of empty suits that I held up on pedestals.&quot;

When asked on October 5 by &quot;The New York Times&quot; if he knew the name of the leader of North Korea, Johnson said &quot;yes,&quot; but declined to give the name despite being pressed.
Johnson was not invited to participate in the presidential debates because he did not meet the criterion of 15% support in five polls set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2015, Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed a lawsuit against the commission, arguing that the commission and its rules violated antitrust law and the First Amendment. In August 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed. Johnson&#x27;s poll numbers had been averaging between 7 and 9 percent. Johnson&#x27;s campaign manager Ron Nielson argued for Johnson&#x27;s inclusion, citing Ross Perot&#x27;s admission to the debates in the 1992 debates, when Perot was polling at 8 percent.

A &quot;Washington Post&quot;-SurveyMonkey 50-state poll, conducted online between August 9 and September 1 found Gary Johnson polling at 10% or higher in 42 states, and at 15% or higher in 15 states (Johnson received 25% in his home state of New Mexico and 23% in Utah). Another poll conducted in mid-August by the Pew Research Center found Johnson supported by about 10% of registered voters. Of Johnson supporters, more than 60% identified as independent and more than 70% were younger than fifty years old. Johnson&#x27;s supporters were evenly divided between men and women.

After the election, Johnson stated in an interview with the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; that he does not intend to run for public office again, saying, &quot;Maybe I stay politically active, but not as a candidate. I will leave that to others.&quot; He subsequently confirmed that he would not seek the Libertarian Party&#x27;s nomination in 2020.

==2018 U.S. Senate race==

Johnson was speculated to run in the 2018 U.S. Senate race in New Mexico after Land Commissioner Aubrey Dunn Jr., then the Libertarian nominee, dropped out of the race. In August 2018, Johnson formally accepted the Libertarian Party of New Mexico&#x27;s nomination. Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky crossed party lines to endorse Johnson&#x27;s bid; Johnson was also endorsed by the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Maine, Eric Brakey.

In the November 2018 election, Democratic incumbent Martin Heinrich was reelected with 376,998 votes (54%); Republican nominee Mick Rich received 212,813 votes (31%); and Johnson received 107,201 votes (15%).

==Political positions==

Johnson&#x27;s views have been described as fiscally conservative and socially liberal with a philosophy of limited government and military non-interventionism. Johnson spoke at the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a forum for conservative politicians. He has identified as a classical liberal. He would repeal Obamacare. Johnson has said he favors simplifying and reducing taxes. During his governorship, Johnson cut taxes fourteen times and never increased them. Due to his stance on taxes, political pundit David Weigel described him as &quot;the original Tea Party candidate.&quot; Johnson has advocated the FairTax as a template for tax reform. This proposal would abolish all federal income, corporate and capital gains taxes, and replace them with a 23% tax on consumption of all non-essential goods, while providing a regressive rebate to households according to household size, regardless of income level. He has argued that this would ensure transparency in the tax system and incentivize the private sector to create &quot;tens of millions of jobs.&quot; In June 2016, Johnson said that he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stating that he previously was skeptical &quot;because these trade agreements are just laden with crony capitalism,&quot; but is now informed it, in fact, fosters free trade.

=== Death penalty ===
In 1994, Johnson ran for governor of New Mexico, campaigning as a strong proponent of the death penalty, but over time, he changed his opinion. He now supports abolishing capital punishment and replacing it with life sentences.

=== Environmental ===
Johnson&#x27;s 2016 campaign website acknowledged that the climate is &quot;probably&quot; changing and that humans are &quot;probably&quot; contributing to this change. Johnson has argued that climate change will not matter in the &quot;long-term&quot; and rejects government action to control or limit – including cap and trade – as ineffective: &quot;When you look at the amount of money we are looking to spend on global warmingin the trillionsand look at the result, I just argue that the result is completely inconsequential to the money we would end up spending,&quot; he said. &quot;We can direct those moneys to other ways that would be much more beneficial to mankind.&quot; Johnson has signed the Western Governors&#x27; Association resolution, which aims at &quot;collaborative, incentive driven, locally-based solutions,&quot; and has advocated for free market solutions to environmental problems. He has stated that he will not &quot;compromise when it comes to clean air, clean land, or clean water.&quot; Johnson supports nuclear energy and fossil fuels, but has stated that the government has a role to protect Americans against businesses that would harm human health or property, including environmental harm.

=== Campaign finance ===
Johnson opposed the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;, allowing unlimited corporate independent expenditures on political campaigns, while also encouraging full disclosure of such expenditures.

=== Fiscal ===
Johnson has said that he would immediately balance the federal budget, and would demand a balanced budget amendment, but maintained a state deficit. He has advocated passing a law allowing for state bankruptcy and expressly ruling out a federal bailout of any states.

=== Healthcare ===
He has stated he supports &quot;slashing government spending&quot;, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, which would involve cutting Medicare and Medicaid by 43 percent and turning them into block grant programs, with control of spending in the hands of the states to create, in his words, &quot;fifty laboratories of innovation.&quot; He has referred to Social Security as a pyramid scheme.

=== Federal Reserve ===
Johnson has expressed opposition to the Federal Reserve System, which he has cited as massively devaluing the strength of the U.S. dollar, and would not veto legislation to eliminate it – although he has stated that no such bill is likely to come out of Congress during his administration. He has also supported an audit of the central bank, and urged Members of Congress in July 2012 to vote in favor of Ron Paul&#x27;s Federal Reserve Transparency Act.

=== Foreign policy ===
In his campaign for the Libertarian Party nomination, he stated he opposed foreign wars and pledged to cut the military budget by 43 percent in his first term as president. He would cut the military&#x27;s overseas bases, uniformed and civilian personnel, research and development, intelligence, and nuclear weapons programs, while maintaining an &quot;invincible defense.&quot; Johnson opposed U.S. involvement in the War in Afghanistan and opposed the U.S. involvement in the Libyan Civil War. He has stated that he does not believe Iran is a military threat, would use his presidential power to prevent Israel from attacking Iran, and would not follow Israel, or any other ally, into a war that it had initiated. While Johnson views the Islamic threat to the US as overrated, he has been openly advocating for greater diplomacy with China regarding North Korea, which, in his view, &quot;is the biggest threat in the world today,&quot; stating &quot;...one of these days, one of their ICBMs is going to work.&quot; However, he does support waging war for humanitarian reasons.

=== Civil liberties ===
Johnson has been a strong supporter of civil liberties and has received the highest score of any candidate from the American Civil Liberties Union for supporting drug decriminalization while opposing censorship and regulation of the Internet, the Patriot Act, enhanced airport screenings, and the indefinite detention of prisoners. He has spoken in favor of the separation of church and state, and has said that he does not &quot;seek the counsel of God&quot; when determining his political agenda. Johnson endorsed same-sex marriage in 2011; he has since called for a constitutional amendment protecting equal marriage rights, and criticized Obama&#x27;s position on the issue as having &quot;thrown this question back to the states.&quot; Johnson supports the enforcement of Protected Classes that was established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and believes that providers should be prohibited from discriminating between customers based on demographics, such as race or sexuality. This differentiated him from his Libertarian Party opponents in the party primary, especially Austin Petersen. He has been a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana and has said that if he were president, he would remove it from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act as well as issue an executive order pardoning nonviolent marijuana offenders. Johnson has stated that he would pardon NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. He believes that decriminalizing sex work should be left up to the states, but has said that prostitutes are more &quot;at risk&quot; in an illegal environment.

=== Abortion ===
Johnson supports abortion access. He has stated he believes that &quot;it&#x27;s the woman&#x27;s choice.&quot; His 2016 position page on abortion states the &quot;woman must be allowed to make decisions about her own health&quot; and &quot;government should not be in the business of second guessing&quot;.

=== Immigration ===
Johnson supports comprehensive immigration reform and has criticized the immigration stances of Obama, Trump, and Hillary Clinton. In his 2012 campaign, he summed up his proposals as simplifying legal immigration while tackling illegal immigration. Johnson proposes &quot;eliminating categories and quotas&quot; and offering illegal immigrants without criminal records in the U.S. a path to legal status. In 2012, he called walls ineffective in stopping illegal immigrants and argued that the U.S. should instead work on tackling Mexican drug cartels by decriminalizing marijuana and giving cartels &quot;diminished incentives to violate U.S. law.&quot; Johnson believes the root of illegal immigration is what he calls America&#x27;s complicated immigration policies and has said the U.S. should &quot;recognize the real problem – a flawed system – and fix it&quot;. &quot;Even for those from the right countries or with the right skills, our bureaucracy makes it ridiculously slow and cumbersome to come here legally&quot;, he has said. Johnson advocates simplifying restrictions on temporary work visas, granting illegal immigrants who obey the law a two-year grace period to obtain work visas and streamlining the immigration process. He has also said, &quot;a work visa should include a background check and a Social Security card so that taxes get paid&quot; and supports a &quot;one strike, you&#x27;re out&quot; deportation rule for immigrants who try to circumnavigate or cheat a simplified immigration process.

=== Gun laws ===
Johnson opposes federal and state gun control legislation, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m a firm believer in the Second Amendment and so I would not have signed legislation banning assault weapons or automatic weapons.&quot; Johnson says that the Second Amendment &quot;was designed to protect us against a government that could be very intrusive. And in this country, we have a growing police state – if people can own assault rifles or automatic rifles, I think leads to a more civil government.&quot; Johnson would, however, limit weapons such as rocket launchers. Johnson believes that allowing concealed carrying of guns reduces crime and gun violence. He opposes barring gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list, because he claims that such lists have a high error rate. Johnson has called for a &quot;thousand-person taskforce&quot; or &quot;hot line&quot; to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns, and has questioned why the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting was not &quot;deprived of his guns&quot; after being interviewed three times.

==Personal life==

Johnson was married to his college girlfriend, Dee Johnson (née Simms; 1952–2006) from 1977 to 2005. As First Lady of New Mexico, she engaged in campaigns against smoking and for breast cancer awareness and oversaw the expansion of the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. He initiated a separation in May 2005, and four months later announced that they would divorce. At the age of 54, Dee Johnson died unexpectedly on December 22, 2006, her cause of death later attributed to hypertensive heart disease. The couple had two children, now adults. He also has a granddaughter, Cora, through his son Erik.

Johnson was an avid triathlete who biked extensively. During his term in office, he competed in several triathlons, marathons and bike races. He competed three times (1993, 1997, 1999) as a celebrity invitee at the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii, registering his best time for the swim, bike ride, and marathon run in 1999 with 10 hours, 39 minutes, and 16 seconds. He once ran in 30 consecutive hours in the Rocky Mountains. On May 30, 2003, he reached the summit of Mount Everest &quot;despite toes blackened with frostbite.&quot; He has climbed all of the Seven Summits: Mount Everest, Mount Elbrus, Denali, Mount Kilimanjaro, Aconcagua, Mount Vinson, and Carstensz Pyramidthe tallest peaks in Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, South America, Antarctica, and Australia respectively. He completed the Bataan Memorial Death March at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, in which participants traverse a course through the desert, many of them in combat boots and wearing packs.

On October 12, 2005, Johnson was involved in a near-fatal paragliding accident when his wing caught in a tree and he fell approximately to the ground. He suffered multiple bone fractures, including a burst fracture to his twelfth thoracic vertebra, a broken rib, and a broken knee; the accident left him shorter. He used medicinal marijuana for pain control from 2005 to 2008.

Johnson is a Lutheran and has said that his belief in God has given him &quot;a very fundamental belief that we should do unto others as we would have others do unto us.&quot;

Johnson has celiac disease and maintains a gluten-free diet.

<text>Employment is a relationship between two parties regulating the provision of paid labour services. Usually based on a contract, one party, the employer, which might be a corporation, a not-for-profit organization, a co-operative, or any other entity, pays the other, the employee, in return for carrying out assigned work. Employees work in return for wages, which can be paid on the basis of an hourly rate, by piecework or an annual salary, depending on the type of work an employee does, the prevailing conditions of the sector and the bargaining power between the parties. Employees in some sectors may receive gratuities, bonus payments or stock options. In some types of employment, employees may receive benefits in addition to payment. Benefits may include health insurance, housing, and disability insurance. Employment is typically governed by employment laws, organization or legal contracts.

== Employees and employers ==
An employee contributes labour and expertise to an endeavor of an employer or of a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCB) and is usually hired to perform specific duties which are packaged into a job. In a corporate context, an employee is a person who is hired to provide services to a company on a regular basis in exchange for compensation and who does not provide these services as part of an independent business.

===Independent contractor===

An issue that arises in most companies, especially the ones that are in the gig economy, is the classification of workers. A lot of workers that fulfill gigs are often hired as &quot;independent contractors&quot;.

To categorize a worker as an independent contractor rather than an employee, an independent contractor must agree with the client on what the finished work product will be and then the contractor controls the means and manner of achieving the desired outcome. Secondly, an independent contractor offers services to the public at large, not just to one business, and is responsible for disbursing payments from the client, paying unreimbursed expenses, and providing his or her own tools to complete the job. Third, the relationship of the parties is often evidenced by a written agreement that specifies that the worker is an independent contractor and is not entitled to employee benefits; the services provided by the worker are not key to the business; and the relationship is not permanent.

As a general principle of employment law, in the United States, there is a difference between an agent and an independent contractor. The default status of a worker is an employee unless specific guidelines are met, which can be determined by the ABC test. Thus, clarifying whether someone who performs work is an independent contractor or an employee from the beginning, and treating them accordingly, can save a company from trouble later on.

Provided key circumstances, including ones such as that the worker is paid regularly, follows set hours of work, is supplied with tools from the employer, is closely monitored by the employer, acting on behalf of the employer, only works for one employer at a time, they are considered an employee, and the employer will generally be liable for their actions and be obliged to give them benefits. Similarly, the employer is the owner of any invention created by an employee &quot;hired to invent&quot;, even in the absence of an assignment of inventions. In contrast, a company commissioning a work by an independent contractor will not own the copyright unless the company secures either a written contract stating that it is a &quot;work made for hire&quot; or a written assignment of the copyright. In order to stay protected and avoid lawsuits, an employer has to be aware of that distinction.

== Employer–worker relationship ==
Employer and managerial control within an organization rests at many levels and has important implications for staff and productivity alike, with control forming the fundamental link between desired outcomes and actual processes. Employers must balance interests such as decreasing wage constraints with a maximization of labor productivity in order to achieve a profitable and productive employment relationship.

===Labor acquisition / hiring===

The main ways for employers to find workers and for people to find employers are via jobs listings in newspapers (via classified advertising) and online, also called job boards. Employers and job seekers also often find each other via professional recruitment consultants which receive a commission from the employer to find, screen and select suitable candidates. However, a study has shown that such consultants may not be reliable when they fail to use established principles in selecting employees. A more traditional approach is with a &quot;Help Wanted&quot; sign in the establishment (usually hung on a window or door or placed on a store counter). Evaluating different employees can be quite laborious but setting up different techniques to analyze their skills to measure their talents within the field can be best through assessments. Employer and potential employee commonly take the additional step of getting to know each other through the process of a job interview.

===Training and development===

Training and development refers to the employer&#x27;s effort to equip a newly hired employee with the necessary skills to perform at the job, and to help the employee grow within the organization. An appropriate level of training and development helps to improve employee&#x27;s job satisfaction.

===Remuneration===
There are many ways that employees are paid, including by hourly wages, by piecework, by yearly salary, or by gratuities (with the latter often being combined with another form of payment). In sales jobs and real estate positions, the employee may be paid a commission, a percentage of the value of the goods or services that they have sold. In some fields and professions (&quot;e.g.&quot;, executive jobs), employees may be eligible for a bonus if they meet certain targets. Some executives and employees may be paid in shares or stock options, a compensation approach that has the added benefit, from the company&#x27;s point of view, of helping to align the interests of the compensated individual with the performance of the company.

Under the faithless servant doctrine, a doctrine under the laws of a number of states in the United States, and most notably New York State law, an employee who acts unfaithfully towards his employer must forfeit all of the compensation he received during the period of his disloyalty.

===Employee benefits===
Employee benefits are various non-wage compensation provided to employees in addition to their wages or salaries. The benefits can include: housing (employer-provided or employer-paid), group insurance (health, dental, life etc.), disability income protection, retirement benefits, daycare, tuition reimbursement, sick leave, vacation (paid and non-paid), social security, profit sharing, funding of education, and other specialized benefits. In some cases, such as with workers employed in remote or isolated regions, the benefits may include meals. Employee benefits can improve the relationship between employee and employer and lowers staff turnover.

=== Organizational justice ===
Organizational justice is an employee&#x27;s perception and judgement of employer&#x27;s treatment in the context of fairness or justice. The resulting actions to influence the employee-employer relationship is also a part of organizational justice.

=== Workforce organizing ===
Employees can organize into trade or labor unions, which represent the workforce to collectively bargain with the management of organizations about working, and contractual conditions and services.

=== Ending employment ===
Usually, either an employee or employer may end the relationship at any time, often subject to a certain notice period. This is referred to as at-will employment. The contract between the two parties specifies the responsibilities of each when ending the relationship and may include requirements such as notice periods, severance pay, and security measures. A contract forbidding an employee from leaving their employment, under penalty of a surety bond, is referred to as an employment bond. In some professions, notably teaching, civil servants, university professors, and some orchestra jobs, some employees may have tenure, which means that they cannot be dismissed at will. Another type of termination is a layoff.

==Wage labor==

Wage labor is the socioeconomic relationship between a worker and an employer, where the worker sells their labor under a formal or informal employment contract. These transactions usually occur in a labor market where wages are market-determined. In exchange for the wages paid, the work product generally becomes the undifferentiated property of the employer, except for special cases such as the vesting of intellectual property patents in the United States where patent rights are usually vested in the original personal inventor. A wage laborer is a person whose primary means of income is from the selling of his or her labor in this way.

In modern mixed economies such as that of the OECD countries, it is currently the dominant form of work arrangement. Although most work occurs following this structure, the wage work arrangements of CEOs, professional employees, and professional contract workers are sometimes conflated with class assignments, so that &quot;wage labor&quot; is considered to apply only to unskilled, semi-skilled or manual labor.

===Wage slavery===
Wage labor, as institutionalized under today&#x27;s market economic systems, has been criticized, especially by socialists, using the pejorative term wage slavery. Socialists draw parallels between the trade of labor as a commodity and slavery. Cicero is also known to have suggested such parallels.

The American philosopher John Dewey posited that until &quot;industrial feudalism&quot; is replaced by &quot;industrial democracy&quot;, politics will be &quot;the shadow cast on society by big business&quot;. Thomas Ferguson has postulated in his investment theory of party competition that the undemocratic nature of economic institutions under capitalism causes elections to become occasions when blocs of investors coalesce and compete to control the state plus cities. 

American business theorist Jeffrey Pfeffer posits that contemporary employment practices and employer commonalities in the United States, including toxic working environments, job insecurity, long hours and increased performance pressure from management, are responsible for 120,000 excess deaths annually, making the workplace the fifth leading cause of death in the United States.

==Employment contract==
===Australia===
Australian employment has been governed by the Fair Work Act since 2009.

===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) is an association of national level with its international reputation of co-operation and welfare of the migrant workforce as well as its approximately 1200 members agencies in collaboration with and support from the Government of Bangladesh.

===Canada===
In the Canadian province of Ontario, formal complaints can be brought to the Ministry of Labour. In the province of Quebec, grievances can be filed with the Commission des normes du travail.

=== Germany ===
Two of the prominent examples of work and employment contracts in Germany are the Werksvertrag or the Arbeitsvertrag, which is a form of Dienstleistungsvertrag (service-oriented contract). An Arbeitsvertrag can also be temporary, whereas a temporary worker is working under Zeitarbeit or Leiharbeit. Another employment setting is Arbeitnehmerüberlassung (ANÜ).

===India===
India has options for a fixed term contract or a permanent contract. Both contracts are entitled to minimum wages, fixed working hours and social security contributions.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan has no contract Labor, Minimum Wage and Provident Funds Acts. Contract labor in Pakistan must be paid minimum wage and certain facilities are to be provided to labor. However, the Acts are not yet fully implemented.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, employment is regulated by the Department of Labor and Employment.

===Sweden===
According to Swedish law, there are three types of employment.
* Test employment (Swedish: &quot;Provanställning&quot;), where the employer hires a person for a test period of 6 months maximum. The employment can be ended at any time without giving any reason. This type of employment can be offered only once per employer and in employee combination. Usually, a time limited or normal employment is offered after a test employment.
* Time limited employment (Swedish: &quot;Tidsbegränsad anställning&quot;). The employer hires a person for a specified time. Usually, they are extended for a new period. Total maximum two years per employer and employee combination, then it automatically counts as a normal employment.
* Normal employment (Swedish: &quot;Tillsvidareanställning&quot; / &quot;Fast anställning&quot;), which has no time limit (except for retirement etc.). It can still be ended for two reasons: personal reason, immediate end of employment only for strong reasons such as crime, or lack of work tasks (Swedish: &quot;Arbetsbrist&quot;), cancellation of employment, usually because of bad income for the company. There is a cancellation period of 1–6 months, and rules for how to select employees, basically those with shortest employment time shall be cancelled first.
There are no laws about minimum salary in Sweden. Instead, there are agreements between employer organizations and trade unions about minimum salaries, and other employment conditions.

There is a type of employment contract which is common but not regulated in law, and that is Hour employment (Swedish: &quot;Timanställning&quot;), which can be Normal employment (unlimited), but the work time is unregulated and decided per immediate need basis. The employee is expected to be answering the phone and come to work when needed, e.g. when someone is ill and absent from work. They will receive salary only for actual work time and can in reality be fired for no reason by not being called anymore. This type of contract is common in the public sector.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, employment contracts are categorized by the government into the following types:
* Fixed-term contract: last for a certain length of time, are set in advance, end when a specific task is completed, ends when a specific event takes place.
* Full-time or part-time contract: has no defined length of time, can be terminated by either party, is to accomplish a specific task, specified number of hours.
* Agency staff
* Freelancers, Consultants and Contractors
* Zero-hour contracts

===United States===
For purposes of U.S. federal income tax withholding, 26 U.S.C. § 3401(c) provides a definition for the term &quot;employee&quot; specific to chapter 24 of the Internal Revenue Code:

&quot;For purposes of this chapter, the term &quot;employee&quot; includes an officer, employee, or elected official of the United States, a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing. The term &quot;employee&quot; also includes an officer of a corporation.&quot; This definition does not exclude all those who are commonly known as &#x27;employees&#x27;. &quot;Similarly, Latham&#x27;s instruction which indicated that under 26 U.S.C. § 3401(c) the category of &#x27;employee&#x27; does not include privately employed wage earners is a preposterous reading of the statute. It is obvious that within the context of both statutes the word &#x27;includes&#x27; is a term of enlargement not of limitation, and the reference to certain entities or categories is not intended to exclude all others.&quot;

Employees are often contrasted with independent contractors, especially when there is dispute as to the worker&#x27;s entitlement to have matching taxes paid, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance benefits. However, in September 2009, the court case of &quot;Brown v. J. Kaz, Inc.&quot; ruled that independent contractors are regarded as employees for the purpose of discrimination laws if they work for the employer on a regular basis, and said employer directs the time, place, and manner of employment.

In non-union work environments, in the United States, unjust termination complaints can be brought to the United States Department of Labor.

Labor unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the United States. Their activity today centers on collective bargaining over wages, benefits, and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level.

Most unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the AFL–CIO created in 1955, and the Change to Win Federation which split from the AFL–CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL–CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues.

==Age-related issues==

=== Younger age workers ===


Young workers are at higher risk for occupational injury and face certain occupational hazards at a higher rate; this is generally due to their employment in high-risk industries. For example, in the United States, young people are injured at work at twice the rate of their older counterparts. These workers are also at higher risk for motor vehicle accidents at work, due to less work experience, a lower use of seat belts, and higher rates of distracted driving. To mitigate this risk, those under the age of 17 are restricted from certain types of driving, including transporting people and goods under certain circumstances.

High-risk industries for young workers include agriculture, restaurants, waste management, and mining. In the United States, those under the age of 18 are restricted from certain jobs that are deemed dangerous under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Youth employment programs are most effective when they include both theoretical classroom training and hands-on training with work placements.

In the conversation of employment among younger aged workers, youth unemployment has also been monitored. Youth unemployment rates tend to be higher than the adult rates in every country in the world.

=== Older age workers ===
Those older than the statutory defined retirement age may continue to work, either out of enjoyment or necessity. However, depending on the nature of the job, older workers may need to transition into less-physical forms of work to avoid injury. Working past retirement age also has positive effects, because it gives a sense of purpose and allows people to maintain social networks and activity levels. Older workers are often found to be discriminated against by employers.

==Working poor==

Employment is no guarantee of escaping poverty, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that as many as 40% of workers are poor, not earning enough to keep their families above the $2 a day poverty line. For instance, in India most of the chronically poor are wage earners in formal employment, because their jobs are insecure and low paid and offer no chance to accumulate wealth to avoid risks. According to the UNRISD, increasing labor productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%. Both increased employment opportunities and increased labor productivity (as long as it also translates into higher wages) are needed to tackle poverty. Increases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of &quot;working poor&quot;, which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of &quot;quality&quot; and not &quot;quantity&quot; in labor market policies. This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show. In Vietnam, for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued. Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the United States, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s. Oxfam and social scientist Mark Robert Rank have argued that the economy of the United States is failing to provide jobs that can adequately support families. According to sociologist Matthew Desmond, the US &quot;offers some of the lowest wages in the industrialized world,&quot; which has &quot;swelled the ranks of the working poor, most of whom are thirty-five or older.&quot;

Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute argue that there are differences across economic sectors in creating employment that reduces poverty. 24 instances of growth were examined, in which 18 reduced poverty. This study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, such as manufacturing. The services sector is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth. Agriculture provides a safety net for jobs and economic buffer when other sectors are struggling.

==Models of the employment relationship==
Scholars conceptualize the employment relationship in various ways. A key assumption is the extent to which the employment relationship necessarily includes conflicts of interests between employers and employees, and the form of such conflicts. In economic theorizing, the labor market mediates all such conflicts such that employers and employees who enter into an employment relationship are assumed to find this arrangement in their own self-interest. In human resource management theorizing, employers and employees are assumed to have shared interests (or a unity of interests, hence the label “unitarism”). Any conflicts that exist are seen as a manifestation of poor human resource management policies or interpersonal clashes such as personality conflicts, both of which can and should be managed away. From the perspective of pluralist industrial relations, the employment relationship is characterized by a plurality of stakeholders with legitimate interests (hence the label “pluralism), and some conflicts of interests are seen as inherent in the employment relationship (e.g., wages v. profits). Lastly, the critical paradigm emphasizes antagonistic conflicts of interests between various groups (e.g., the competing capitalist and working classes in a Marxist framework) that are part of a deeper social conflict of unequal power relations. As a result, there are four common models of employment:

# Mainstream economics: employment is seen as a mutually advantageous transaction in a free market between self-interested legal and economic equals
# Human resource management (unitarism): employment is a long-term partnership of employees and employers with common interests
# Pluralist industrial relations: employment is a bargained exchange between stakeholders with some common and some competing economic interests and unequal bargaining power due to imperfect labor markets
# Critical industrial relations: employment is an unequal power relation between competing groups that is embedded in and inseparable from systemic inequalities throughout the socio-politico-economic system.

These models are important because they help reveal why individuals hold differing perspectives on human resource management policies, labor unions, and employment regulation. For example, human resource management policies are seen as dictated by the market in the first view, as essential mechanisms for aligning the interests of employees and employers and thereby creating profitable companies in the second view, as insufficient for looking out for workers’ interests in the third view, and as manipulative managerial tools for shaping the ideology and structure of the workplace in the fourth view.

==Academic literature==
Literature on the employment impact of economic growth and on how growth is associated with employment at a macro, sector and industry level was aggregated in 2013.

Researchers found evidence to suggest growth in manufacturing and services have good impact on employment. They found GDP growth on employment in agriculture to be limited, but that value-added growth had a relatively larger impact. The impact on job creation by industries/economic activities as well as the extent of the body of evidence and the key studies. For extractives, they again found extensive evidence suggesting growth in the sector has limited impact on employment. In textiles, however, although evidence was low, studies suggest growth there positively contributed to job creation. In agri-business and food processing, they found impact growth to be positive.

They found that most available literature focuses on OECD and middle-income countries somewhat, where economic growth impact has been shown to be positive on employment. The researchers didn&#x27;t find sufficient evidence to conclude any impact of growth on employment in LDCs despite some pointing to the positive impact, others point to limitations. They recommended that complementary policies are necessary to ensure economic growth&#x27;s positive impact on LDC employment. With trade, industry and investment, they only found limited evidence of positive impact on employment from industrial and investment policies and for others, while large bodies of evidence does exist, the exact impact remains contested.

Researchers have also explored the relationship between employment and illicit activities. Using evidence from Africa, a research team found that a program for Liberian ex-fighters reduced work hours on illicit activities. The employment program also reduced interest in mercenary work in nearby wars. The study concludes that while the use of capital inputs or cash payments for peaceful work created a reduction in illicit activities, the impact of training alone is rather low.

== Globalization and employment relations ==
The balance of economic efficiency and social equity is the ultimate debate in the field of employment relations. By meeting the needs of the employer; generating profits to establish and maintain economic efficiency; whilst maintaining a balance with the employee and creating social equity that benefits the worker so that he/she can fund and enjoy healthy living; proves to be a continuous revolving issue in westernized societies.

Globalization has affected these issues by creating certain economic factors that disallow or allow various employment issues. Economist Edward Lee (1996) studies the effects of globalization and summarizes the four major points of concern that affect employment relations:

# International competition, from the newly industrialized countries, will cause unemployment growth and increased wage disparity for unskilled workers in industrialized countries. Imports from low-wage countries exert pressure on the manufacturing sector in industrialized countries and foreign direct investment (FDI) is attracted away from the industrialized nations, towards low-waged countries.
# Economic liberalization will result in unemployment and wage inequality in developing countries. This happens as job losses in uncompetitive industries outstrip job opportunities in new industries.
# Workers will be forced to accept worsening wages and conditions, as a global labor market results in a “race to the bottom”. Increased international competition creates a pressure to reduce the wages and conditions of workers.
# Globalization reduces the autonomy of the nation state. Capital is increasingly mobile and the ability of the state to regulate economic activity is reduced.

What also results from Lee&#x27;s (1996) findings is that in industrialized countries an average of almost 70 per cent of workers are employed in the service sector, most of which consists of non-tradable activities. As a result, workers are forced to become more skilled and develop sought after trades, or find other means of survival. Ultimately this is a result of changes and trends of employment, an evolving workforce, and globalization that is represented by a more skilled and increasing highly diverse labor force, that are growing in non standard forms of employment (Markey, R. et al. 2006).

==Alternatives==

===Subcultures===
Various youth subcultures have been associated with not working, such as the hippie subculture in the 1960s and 1970s (which endorsed the idea of &quot;dropping out&quot; of society) and the punk subculture.

===Post-secondary education===
One of the alternatives to work is engaging in post-secondary education at a college, university or professional school. One of the major costs of obtaining a post-secondary education is the opportunity cost of forgone wages due to not working. At times when jobs are hard to find, such as during recessions, unemployed individuals may decide to get post-secondary education, because there is less of an opportunity cost.

===Social assistance===
In some countries, individuals who are not working can receive social assistance support (e.g., welfare or food stamps) to enable them to rent housing, buy food, repair or replace household goods, maintenance of children and observe social customs that require financial expenditure.

===Volunteerism===
Workers who are not paid wages, such as volunteers who perform tasks for charities, hospitals or not-for-profit organizations, are generally not considered employed. One exception to this is an internship, an employment situation in which the worker receives training or experience (and possibly college credit) as the chief form of compensation.

===Indentured servitude and slavery===
Those who work under obligation for the purpose of fulfilling a debt, such as indentured servants, or as property of the person or entity they work for, such as slaves, do not receive pay for their services and are not considered employed. Some historians suggest that slavery is older than employment, but both arrangements have existed for all recorded history. Indentured servitude and slavery are not considered compatible with human rights or with democracy.

== Self-employment ==
==Local employment==
Local employment initiatives aim to ensure that residents of the area adjacent to an employers&#x27; premises are offered employment there. Local jobs initiatives are common in a construction context. In retail, the Westfield Centre in west London, which opened in 2008, has been noted as an example offering employment to local residents: during the period when the centre was under construction, up to 3000 local people received pre-employment training through a partnership scheme aiming to ensure that a significant proportion of the centre&#x27;s jobs were taken up by local people. 40% of the centre&#x27;s management staff had been locally recruited at the time when the centre opened.

<text>A biscuit, in many English-speaking countries, including Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa but not Canada or the US, is a flour-based baked and shaped food item. Biscuits are typically hard, flat, and unleavened. They are usually sweet and may be made with sugar, chocolate, icing, jam, ginger, or cinnamon. They can also be savoury, similar to crackers. 

Types of biscuit include biscotti, sandwich biscuits (such as custard creams), digestive biscuits, ginger biscuits, shortbread biscuits, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, Anzac biscuits, and speculaas.

In most of North America, nearly all hard sweet biscuits are called &quot;cookies&quot; and savoury biscuits are called &quot;crackers&quot;, while the term &quot;biscuit&quot; is used for a soft, leavened quick bread similar to a savoury version of a &quot;scone&quot;.

==Variations in meaning of &quot;biscuit&quot;==

The word biscuits is used to refer to a broad range of primarily flour-based foods.
* In most of the English-speaking world, a &quot;biscuit&quot; is a small, hard baked product that would be called either a &quot;cookie&quot; or a &quot;cracker&quot; in the United States and sometimes in Canada. &quot;Biscuits&quot; in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, and Ireland are usually hard and may be savoury or sweet, such as chocolate biscuits, digestives, hobnobs, ginger nuts, rich tea, shortbread, bourbons, and custard creams. The term &quot;cookie&quot; typically refers to only one type of biscuit (the sweeter baked dough typically containing chocolate chips or raisins); however, it may also locally refer to specific types of biscuits or breads. 
* In the United States and some parts of Canada, a &quot;biscuit&quot; is a quick bread, somewhat similar to an unsweetened scone, but with a texture more &quot;fluffy and flaky&quot; vs. &quot;sturdy and crumbly&quot;. Biscuits may be referred to as either &quot;baking powder biscuits&quot; or &quot;buttermilk biscuits&quot; if buttermilk is used rather than milk as a liquid, as buttermilk is not only flavourful but acidic (allowing use of baking soda vs. baking powder which is a mixture of baking soda with an acidifier and buffer). A Southern regional variation using the term &quot;beaten biscuit&quot; (or in New England &quot;sea biscuit&quot;) is closer to hardtack than soft dough biscuits.
* In Canada, the term &quot;biscuit&quot; can simultaneously refer to what is commonly identified as a biscuit in either the United Kingdom or the United States. The &quot;Canadian Oxford Dictionary&quot; describes each word in reference to the other; &quot;biscuit&quot; can mean &quot;Brit. a cookie&quot;, whilst &quot;cookie&quot; can mean &quot;N. Amer. a small sweet biscuit&quot;. &quot;Tea biscuit&quot; is also a standard Canadianism for the &quot;North American&quot; biscuit.
In general, the British, Australians, South Africans, New Zealanders, Indians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Singaporeans, Nigerians, Kenyans, and Irish use the British meaning of &quot;biscuit&quot; for the sweet biscuit. The terms &quot;biscuit&quot; and &quot;cookie&quot; are used interchangeably, depending on the region and the speaker, with &quot;biscuits&quot; usually referring to hard, sweet biscuits (such as digestives, Nice, Bourbon creams, etc.) and &quot;cookies&quot; often specifically for chocolate chip cookies. The British meaning is at the root of the name of the United States&#x27; most prominent maker of cookies and crackers, the National Biscuit Company, now called Nabisco.

==Etymology==
The modern-day difference in the English language regarding the word &quot;biscuit&quot; is remarked on by British cookery writer Elizabeth David in &quot;English Bread and Yeast Cookery&quot;, in the chapter &quot;Yeast Buns and Small Tea Cakes&quot; and section &quot;Soft Biscuits&quot;. She writes:

It is interesting that these soft biscuits (such as scones) are common to Scotland and Guernsey, and that the term &quot;biscuit&quot; as applied to a soft product was retained in these places, and in America, whereas in England it has completely died out.
 
The Old French word is derived from the Latin words (&#x27;twice&#x27;) and (&#x27;to cook&#x27;, &#x27;cooked&#x27;), and, hence, means &#x27;twice-cooked&#x27;. This is because biscuits were originally cooked in a twofold process: first baked, and then dried out in a slow oven. This term was then adapted into English in the 14th century during the Middle Ages, in the Middle English word , to represent a hard, twice-baked product (see the German Zwieback). It finally evolved into &quot;biscuit&quot; to follow the modern French spelling. The Dutch language from around 1703 had adopted the word (&#x27;little cake&#x27;) to have a similar meaning for a similar hard, baked product. The difference between the secondary Dutch word and that of Latin origin is that, whereas the is a cake that rises during baking, the biscuit, which has no raising agent, in general does not (see gingerbread/ginger biscuit), except for the expansion of heated air during baking. Another cognate Dutch form is , which is a circular and brittle grain product usually covered by savoury or sweet toppings and eaten at breakfast.

When continental Europeans began to emigrate to colonial North America, the two words and their &quot;same but different&quot; meanings began to clash. The words &quot;cookie&quot; or &quot;cracker&quot; became the words of choice to mean a hard, baked product. Further confusion has been added by the adoption of the word biscuit for a small leavened bread popular in the United States. According to the American English dictionary Merriam-Webster, a cookie is a &quot;small flat or slightly raised cake&quot;. A biscuit is &quot;any of various hard or crisp dry baked product&quot; similar to the American English terms &quot;cracker&quot; or &quot;cookie&quot;, or &quot;a small quick bread made from dough that has been rolled out and cut or dropped from a spoon&quot;.

In a number of other European languages, terms derived from the Latin refer instead to yet another baked product, similar to the sponge cake; e.g. Spanish , German , Russian (), and Polish .

In modern Italian usage, the term is used to refer to any type of hard twice-baked biscuit, and not only to the as in English-speaking countries; it is the same for the modern French term .

==History==

===Biscuits for travel===

The need for nutritious, easy-to-store, easy-to-carry, and long-lasting foods on long journeys, in particular at sea, was initially solved by taking livestock along with a butcher/cook. However, this took up additional space on what were either horse-powered treks or small ships, reducing the time of travel before additional food was required. This resulted in early armies&#x27; adopting the style of hunter-foraging.

The introduction of the baking of processed cereals, including the creation of flour, provided a more reliable source of food. Egyptian sailors carried a flat, brittle loaf of millet bread called &quot;dhourra&quot; cake while the Romans had a biscuit called &quot;buccellum&quot;. Roman cookbook &quot;Apicius&quot; describes: &quot;a thick paste of fine wheat flour was boiled and spread out on a plate. When it had dried and hardened, it was cut up and then fried until crisp, then served with honey and pepper.&quot;

Many early physicians believed that most medicinal problems were associated with digestion. Hence, for both sustenance and avoidance of illness, a daily consumption of a biscuit was considered good for health.

Hard biscuits soften as they age. To solve this problem, early bakers attempted to create the hardest biscuit possible. Because it is so hard and dry, if properly stored and transported, navies&#x27; hardtack will survive rough handling and high temperature. Baked hard, it can be kept without spoiling for years as long as it is kept dry. For long voyages, hardtack was baked four times, rather than the more common two. To soften hardtack for eating, it was often dunked in brine, coffee, or some other liquid or cooked into a skillet meal.

The collection &quot;Sayings of the Desert Fathers&quot; mentions that Anthony the Great (who lived in the 4th century AD) ate biscuits and the text implies that it was a popular food among monks of the time and region.

At the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588, the daily allowance on board a Royal Navy ship was one pound of biscuit plus one gallon of beer. Samuel Pepys in 1667 first regularised naval victualling with varied and nutritious rations. Royal Navy hardtack during Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard at Gosport, Hampshire, stamped with the Queen&#x27;s mark and the number of the oven in which they were baked. When machinery was introduced into the process the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets about long and wide which were stamped in one stroke into about sixty hexagonal-shaped biscuits. This left the sheets sufficiently coherent to be placed in the oven in one piece and when baked they were easy to separate. The hexagonal shape rather than traditional circular biscuits meant a saving in material and was easier to pack. Biscuits remained an important part of the Royal Navy sailor&#x27;s diet until the introduction of canned foods. Canned meat was first marketed in 1814; preserved beef in tins was officially added to Royal Navy rations in 1847.

===Confectionery biscuits===

Early biscuits were hard, dry, and unsweetened. They were most often cooked after bread, in a cooling bakers&#x27; oven; they were a cheap form of sustenance for the poor.

By the 7th century AD, cooks of the Persian empire had learnt from their forebears the techniques of lightening and enriching bread-based mixtures with eggs, butter, and cream, and sweetening them with fruit and honey. One of the earliest spiced biscuits was gingerbread, in French, &quot;pain d&#x27;épices&quot;, meaning &quot;spice bread&quot;, brought to Europe in 992 by the Armenian monk Grégoire de Nicopolis. He left Nicopolis Pompeii, of Lesser Armenia to live in Bondaroy, France, near the town of Pithiviers. He stayed there for seven years and taught French priests and Christians how to cook gingerbread. This was originally a dense, treaclely (molasses-based) spice cake or bread. As it was so expensive to make, early ginger biscuits were a cheap form of using up the leftover bread mix.
With the combination of knowledge spreading from Al-Andalus, and then the Crusades and subsequent spread of the spice trade to Europe, the cooking techniques and ingredients of Arabia spread into Northern Europe. By mediaeval times, biscuits were made from a sweetened, spiced paste of breadcrumbs and then baked (e.g., gingerbread), or from cooked bread enriched with sugar and spices and then baked again. King Richard I of England (aka Richard the Lionheart) left for the Third Crusade (1189–92) with &quot;biskit of muslin&quot;, which was a mixed corn compound of barley, rye, and bean flour.

As the making and quality of bread had been controlled to this point, so were the skills of biscuit-making through the craft guilds. As the supply of sugar began, and the refinement and supply of flour increased, so did the ability to sample more leisurely foodstuffs, including sweet biscuits. Early references from the Vadstena monastery show how the Swedish nuns were baking gingerbread to ease digestion in 1444. The first documented trade of gingerbread biscuits dates to the 16th century, where they were sold in monastery pharmacies and town square farmers markets. Gingerbread became widely available in the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution in Britain sparked the formation of businesses in various industries, and the British biscuit firms of McVitie&#x27;s, Carr&#x27;s, Huntley &amp; Palmers, and Crawfords were all established by 1850.

British biscuit companies vied to dominate the market with new products and eye-catching packaging. The decorative biscuit tin, invented by Huntley &amp; Palmers in 1831, saw British biscuits exported around the world. In 1900 Huntley &amp; Palmers biscuits were sold in 172 countries, and their global reach was reflected in their advertising. Competition and innovation among British firms saw 49 patent applications for biscuit-making equipment, tins, dough-cutting machines and ornamental moulds between 1897 and 1900. In 1891, Cadbury filed a patent for a chocolate-coated biscuit. Along with local farm produce of meat and cheese, many regions of the world have their own distinct style of biscuit due to the historic prominence of this form of food.

===Introduction in South Asia===

Biscuits and loaves were introduced in Bengal during the British colonial period and became popular within the Sylheti Muslim community. However, the middle-class Hindus of Cachar and Sylhet were very suspicious of biscuits and breads as they believed they were baked by Muslims. On one occasion, a few Hindus in Cachar caught an Englishman eating biscuits with tea, which caused an uproar. The information reached the Hindus of Sylhet and a small rebellion occurred. In response to this, companies started to advertise their bread as &quot;machine-made&quot; and &quot;untouched by (Muslim) hand&quot; to tell Hindus that the breads were &quot;safe for consumption&quot;. This incident is mentioned in Bipin Chandra Pal&#x27;s autobiography and he mentions how culinary habits of Hindus gradually changed and biscuits and loaves eventually became increasingly popular.

==Types==
Biscuits can be placed in four categories, separated by their process and ingredients:

=== Crackers ===

Crackers are savory biscuits with a &quot;crispy, open texture&quot;. They include biscuits such as cream crackers, &quot;Ritz-type&quot; crackers, saltines, snack crackers (e.g. Arnott&#x27;s Shapes) and water biscuits. Cracker doughs often have some of the following features: they are leavened, have a water content between 15–25%, are laminated and rise during the first part of baking.

In a general process to make crackers, dough is mixed and fermented. It is fed through a dough feed conveyer to be laminated, sheeted and cut. It is baked, sprayed with oil and cooled, before finally being packed. Baking surfaces differ by the country biscuits are baked in: traditional British biscuits being baked on light wire mesh, while American biscuits are baked on heavy mesh. The baking process requires high amounts of energy to get the relatively high hydration doughs to a final biscuit that is 1.5–2.5% water.

=== Semi-sweet ===
Semi-sweet biscuits are distinguished by a their consistent texture and colour. This consistency, and a voluminous appearance are a product primarily of the presence of humidity during the first part of baking. Examples of semi-sweet biscuits include Arrowroot, breakfast biscuits, Marie, Petit-Beurre and Rich tea. The doughs of semi-sweet biscuits have strong gluten, making it shrink during baking. They have low sugar and fat contents, and their water content, about 12%, is reduced to 1.5–3% through the baking process. In making semi-sweet biscuits, the dough is mixed, fed, undergoes sheeting and is cut and is baked. The biscuits are cooled before they are processed through stacking and/or packing.

=== Short doughs ===

Biscuits containing relatively high amounts of sugar and fat. The category covers many regional specialties, including the British custard cream and digestives, the Dutch speculaas, the Indian glucose biscuit and the Scottish shortbread. It also covers more generic biscuits of Lincoln and malted milk. Short biscuits are the simplest biscuits to make, which has led to them being widely produced in great volumes. They are frequently fortified. Short dough biscuits have a relatively low water content, and are cooked slower, and at low temperatures than crackers and semi-sweet biscuits.

Short doughs are produced through a two stage mixing process. The dough is stood, fed and undergoes rotary molding, the step by which short biscuits derive their alternative name of rotary molded biscuits. They are baked, cooled and stacked and packed. The structure is derived from a high humidity during early stages of baking

=== Cookies ===

The widest category, cookies have very soft doughs. They are often baked directly on a steel oven band. Cookies have high sugar and fat contents, and are cooked longer than other biscuits at relatively low temperatures. Through the presence of humidity during the first stage of cooking, cookies spread as they are baked. Many cookies contain inclusions, such as nuts, chocolate chips (chocolate chip cookie) and fruits (e.g. raisins and figs in fig rolls). They include butter cookies, extruded cookies and cookies with their centres filled.

Cookies are produced through mixing a dough in two stages. The dough is baked on a steel oven band. It is then cooled and finally stacked and/or packed.

== Culture ==
The digestive biscuit and rich tea have a strong identity in British culture as the traditional accompaniment to a cup of tea and are regularly eaten as such. Some tea drinkers dunk biscuits in tea, allowing them to absorb liquid and soften slightly before consumption. Chocolate digestives, rich tea, and Hobnobs were ranked the UK&#x27;s top three favourite dunking biscuits in 2009. In a non-dunking poll the Chocolate Hobnob was ranked first with custard creams coming third.

<text>Richard de Bury (24 January 1287 – 14 April 1345), also known as Richard Aungerville or Aungervyle, was an English priest, teacher, bishop, writer, and bibliophile. He was a patron of learning and one of the first English collectors of books. He is chiefly remembered for his &quot;Philobiblon&quot;, written to inculcate in the clergy the pursuit of learning and the love of books. The &quot;Philobiblon&quot; is considered one of the earliest books to discuss librarianship in-depth. Completed shortly before de Bury&#x27;s death in 1345, the book wasn&#x27;t published until 1473, and this &quot;little treatise&quot; as he described it, has been regularly reprinted in every century following.

==Early life==
Richard de Bury was born near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the son of Sir Richard Aungervyle, who was descended from a knight who fought for William the Conqueror&#x27;s men. Aungervyle settled in Leicestershire, and the family came into possession of the manor of Willoughby. 
Sir Richard Aungervyle died when de Bury was a young boy. He was educated by his maternal uncle John de Willoughby, and after leaving the grammar school was sent to the University of Oxford, where he studied philosophy and theology. It is often reported that de Bury became a Benedictine monk at Durham Cathedral although several respected sources dispute this, as there is no evidence of him joining the Order. In fact, he was a priest and not a monk. He was made tutor to the future King Edward III whilst Earl of Chester (whom he would later serve as high chancellor and treasurer of England) and, according to Thomas Frognall Dibdin, inspired the prince with his own love of books.

==Administrator==
Somehow he became involved in the intrigues preceding the deposition of King Edward II, and supplied Queen Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer, in Paris with money in 1325 from the revenues of Brienne, of which province he was treasurer. For some time he had to hide in Paris from the officers sent by Edward II to apprehend him. On the accession of Edward III his services were rewarded by rapid promotion. He was cofferer to the king (1327–28), treasurer of the wardrobe (1328–29) and afterwards Lord Privy Seal in 1329. The king repeatedly recommended him to the pope, and twice sent him, in 1330 and 1333, as ambassador to the papal court in exile at Avignon. On the first of these visits he met a fellow bibliophile, Petrarch, who records his impression of Aungerville as &quot;not ignorant of literature and from his youth up curious beyond belief of hidden things&quot;. Petrarch asked him for information about Thule, but de Bury, who promised to reply when he was back at home among his books, never responded to repeated enquiries. Pope John XXII made him his principal chaplain, and presented him with a rochet in earnest of the next vacant bishopric in England.

==Bishop of Durham==
During his absence from England de Bury was made Dean of Wells in February 1333. In September of the same year, he was made Bishop of Durham by the king, over-ruling the choice of the monks, who had elected and actually installed their sub-prior, Robert de Graystanes. In February 1334 de Bury was made Lord Treasurer, an appointment he exchanged later in the year for that of Lord Chancellor. He resigned the following year, and, after making arrangements for the protection of his northern diocese from an expected attack by the Scots, he proceeded in July 1336 to France to attempt a settlement of the claims in dispute between Edward and the French king. In the next year he served on three commissions for the defence of the northern counties. In June 1338 he was once again sent abroad on a peace mission, but within a month was waylaid by the approaching campaign.

De Bury travelled to Coblenz and met Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and in the next year was sent to England to raise money. This seems to have been his last visit to the continent. In 1340 and 1342 he again tried to negotiate peace with the Scots, but afterwards left public politics to care for his diocese and accumulate a library. He sent far and wide in search of manuscripts, rescuing many volumes from the charge of ignorant and neglectful monks. He may sometimes have brought undue pressure to bear on the owners, for it is recorded that an abbot of St Albans bribed him with four valuable books, and that de Bury, who procured certain coveted privileges for the monastery, bought from him thirty-two other books for fifty pieces of silver, far less than their normal price. The record of his passion for books, his &quot;Philobiblon&quot; (Greek for &quot;The Love of Books&quot;), is a Latin treatise in praise of books. The &quot;Philobiblon&quot; was completed in 1344 and first printed in 1473. The most accurate and reliable English translation is by Ernest C. Thomas in 1888. Alfred Hessel describes the Philobiblon as &quot;[t]he particular charm of the apology consist in fact that it contains sound library theory—though clothed in medieval garb&quot;. This remarkable piece of literature is one of the earliest books to discuss librarianship in-depth.

==Bibliophile==
Richard de Bury gives an account of the unwearied efforts made by himself and his agents to collect books. He records his intention of founding a hall at Oxford, and in connection with it a library in which his books were to form the nucleus. He even details the dates to be observed for the lending and care of the books, and had already taken the preliminary steps for the foundation. The bishop died, however, in great poverty on 14 April 1345 at Bishop Auckland, and it seems likely that his collection was dispersed immediately after his death. Of it, the traditional account is that the books were sent to the Durham Benedictines Durham College, Oxford, which was shortly thereafter endowed by Bishop Hatfield, and that on the dissolution of the foundation by Henry VIII they were divided between Duke Humphrey of Gloucester&#x27;s library, Balliol College, Oxford, and George Owen. However, surviving evidence in the rolls of Durham College suggests that the transfer never took place, and no library was built at Durham College until 70 years after de Bury&#x27;s death. Only two of the volumes are known to be in existence; one is a copy of John of Salisbury&#x27;s works in the British Museum, and the other some theological treatises by Anselm and others in the Bodleian.

The chief authority for the bishop&#x27;s life is William de Chambre, printed in Wharton&#x27;s &quot;Anglia Sacra&quot;, 1691, and in &quot;Historiae conelmensis scriptores tres&quot;, Surtees Soc., 1839, who describes him as an amiable and excellent man, charitable in his diocese, and the liberal patron of many learned men, among these being Thomas Bradwardine, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, Richard Fitzralph, afterwards Archbishop of Armagh, the enemy of the mendicant orders, Walter Burley, who translated Aristotle, John Mauduit the astronomer, Robert Holkot and Richard de Kilvington. John Bale and Pits I mention other works of his, &quot;Epistolae Familiares&quot; and &quot;Orationes ad Principes&quot;. The opening words of the &quot;Philobiblon&quot; and the &quot;Epistolae&quot; as given by Bale represent those of the &quot;Philobiblon&quot; and its prologue, of that he apparently made two books out of one treatise. It is possible that the &quot;Orationes&quot; may represent a letter book of Richard de Bury&#x27;s, entitled &quot;Liber Epistolaris quondam dominiis cardi de Bury, Episcopi Dunelmensis&quot;, now in the possession of Lord Harlech.

This manuscript, the contents of which are fully catalogued in the &quot;Fourth Report&quot; (1874) of the Historical Manuscripts Commission (Appendix, pp. 379–397), contains numerous letters from various popes, from the king, a correspondence dealing with the affairs of the university of Oxford, another with the province of Gascony, beside some harangues and letters evidently meant as models to be used on various occasions. It has often been asserted that the &quot;Philobiblon&quot; itself was not written by Richard de Bury at all, but by Robert Holkot. This assertion is supported by the fact that in seven of the extant manuscripts of &quot;Philobiblon&quot; it is ascribed to Holkote in an introductory page, in these or slightly varying terms: &quot;Incipit prologus in re philobiblon ricardi dunelmensis episcopi que libri composuit ag&quot;. The Paris manuscript has simply &quot;Philobiblon olchoti anglici&quot;, and does not contain the usual concluding note of the date when the book was completed by Richard. As a great part of the charm of book lies in the unconscious record of the collector&#x27;s own character, the establishment of Holkot&#x27;s authorship would materially alter its value. A notice of Richard de Bury by his contemporary Adam Murimuth (&quot;Continuatio Chronicarum&quot;, Rolls series, 1889, p. 171) gives a less favourable account of him than does William de Chambre, asserting that he was only moderately learned, but desired to be regarded as a great scholar.

==The &quot;Philobiblon&quot;==
Before his death in 1345, de Bury wrote a book of essays that he compiled in a work entitled &quot;The Philobiblon&quot;. This was a word he created from the Greek meaning &quot;love of books&quot;. Written in Latin, as was the custom of the day, it is separated into twenty chapters. These essays discuss book collecting, the care of books, the &quot;advantages of the love of books&quot;, and the vagaries of wars and how they destroy books. In the book, De Bury states that &quot;the same man cannot love both gold and books&quot;. In Chapter VII entitled &quot;The Complaint of Books against Wars&quot; de Bury writes: 
Fortunately, these were not the idle words of an academic and bibliophile. As a diplomat, de Bury sought to seek peace throughout the realm, sometimes successfully as was the case with Scotland to the north, sometimes unsuccessfully, as was the case with France and the start of the 100 Years War. 
One of the most interesting sections in the &quot;Philobiblon&quot; is Chapter XIX entitled &quot;Of the Manner of lending all our Books to Students&quot;. According to one scholar, the &quot;Philobiblon&quot; is &quot;one of the longest extant medieval texts on the subject of library management&quot;. Here, de Bury describes the practices for circulation control among the students of the college, utilising at times an open-stack rather than the dominant closed-stack system. As to de Bury&#x27;s legacy, it was said about the &quot;Philobiblon&quot;: &quot;it is the sole memorial of one who loved books so much in an age and country that loved them so little&quot;.
